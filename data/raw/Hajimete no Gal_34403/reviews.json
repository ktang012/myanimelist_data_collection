            "content": "\u201cNobody dies a virgin...life fucks us all.\u201d\r\n-Kurt Cobain\r\nWe've all been there. Aimlessly meandering through our high school lives daydreaming about that fateful day we\u2019ll finally lose our virginity. Thoughts of the opposite sex constantly flood our brains, in the form of unrealistic scenarios involving our crushes intoxicatingly succumbing to our supreme hotness. Naturally, high school is a perverted cesspool of teenage hormones, so more than likely you had your own clan of other clodhopping comrades to share phrases like \u201cdude...tits\u201d and \u201chave you seen that chick\u2019s online stream?\u201d For some introverted, socially inept souls, whose virginity is as safe as a maximum security prison thereare anime like Hajimete no Gal. A show that constantly reminds us how often the average male teenager thinks about sex, mostly in a sporadic and succinct manner. Unfortunately, after viewing all ten of its episodes, I can say I now know more than I ever cared to about the \u201caverage\u201d Japanese teenager, ad nauseum. Join me as I explore how not to make an ecchi anime, in honest and excruciating detail. \\n\\n\r\nTo get something off the board immediately, Hajimete no Gal is not a traditional harem anime. A harem, by definition implies that the women \u201cshare\u201d one male, which is the opposite of what happens in this show. Here's what transpires in a nutshell:\\n\\n\r\n1. Awkward, unassuming dude Junichi starts dating popular girl Yukane out of peer pressure to lose his virginity.\\n\r\n2. Multiple chicks adversarial of their blossoming relationship come out of the woodwork in attempts to thwart their bond.\\n\r\n3. Junichi realizes there\u2019s more to relationships than sex (SPOILER ALERT)\\n\r\n4. Junichi\u2019s friend is an overt pedophile that deserves to be locked away for the rest of eternity.\\n\\n\r\nThat's pretty much it. Hajimete gets off to a hobbling start in the way of story. If you came into a ten episode anime labeled in the ecchi genre, you're probably an idiot for fathoming anything other than repetitive, lecherous humor or a plethora of oppai characters. As the anime begins to unfold, the season of love has arrived. Spring, as I'm seeing in Japan apparently causes the entire student populace to transform into a bunch of blithering horndogs. Couples are formed left and right, so our main protagonist and his friends are desperate to find ANY girl willing to approach them without a ten foot pole. Doesn't sound like the most enticing setup for an anime if you ask me. What follows could be a decent series between two characters forging their love, but instead implodes on itself due to some dreadfully written characters and haphazard perversion played off as comedy. \\n\\n\r\nOne big point to speak to in Hajimete no Gal is the writing. The comedic elements are very hit and miss. I'll be honest, there was more than one scene in the anime I busted up laughing. Whether it's the far fetched \u201cwhat-if\u201d illusions Junichi encountered or a dude showing up in a Kirito costume in an effort to impress girls, all did not fall flat. But plenty of it did, and the fact that Studio NAZ tried to pass off a pedophilic character as funny is a disgrace to entertainment enthusiasts everywhere. Hey, at least his friends didn't condone his behavior\u2026 Also, there's this:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cAll I want is a dope pussy to fuck.\u201d\\n\r\nYes, this is a real line from the show.\\n\\n\r\nI can't imagine the budget was very large for this anime, considering there were still-animated screenshots with singing or music in the background on more than one occasion. To me, it came across as a lack of effort on the studio\u2019s behalf. In addition, there were plenty of failed censorships (for an ecchi), and useless scenes thrown into the mix. And yes, before you ask\u2026 there is an obligatory summer episode. Tits galore! The series attempts to find a common ground between the plethora of \u201cnothing ever happens\u201d high school romance anime (Ao Haru Ride) and the quicker escalating lewd shows like Prison School or High School DXD. Unfortunately it's poorly visioned, so a majority of the time is devoted to introducing characters, rather than developing the existing ones. Even a few more episodes would've done the writing staff some favor.\\n\\n\r\nThough exhaustingly bland overall, I have to give Hajimete some credit with how it handles the main character\u2019s relationship with Yukane. What starts off as a dare from his friends, actually turns into something of substance. It's everyone else in the show that I can't stand. At first, Yukane appears to be a tsundere, a trope vital to the framework of any harem anime. However, as things progressed, I actually began to somewhat respect her and the way she handled Junichi, knowing his original intentions for their relationship. It ended up being the only speck of quality in a sea of genericism. From what I understand, the studio ended up leaving out many of the manga scenes involving their development, most likely to better craft a \u201ccash grabbing\u201d series vice one of any legitimacy. It's a shame considering how much better the anime probably could've been.\\n\\n\r\nNene, the only girl that presumably had feelings for Junichi from the anime\u2019s inception, possesses almost every quality I hate in a character. An incessantly ear-piercing voice, a loli physique (minus her enormous breasts) and the fact that she just gets in the way in every scene she accompanies. Along with the iriitating Nene, tanned dominatrix Ranko fills the quota of yandere, while Yui fills that of a tsundere. And of course, they all have their reasons for trying to steal Junichi away from his new girlfriend, come hell or high water. Junichi\u2019s unintentionally abstinent posse consists of a guy with glasses who constantly shouts bombastic phrases, a pedophile who\u2019s drawn a map of every elementary schooler\u2019s location in his neighborhood (literally, wtf?!) and another seemingly average blonde haired dude that does little to nothing in the entire anime. Honestly, these characters only existed to interject punchlines, waiting in the wings for their chance to drop a pointed one-liner. None of the other side characters seemed to matter at all, as they were plot devices if anything.\\n\\n\r\nFor the life of me I can't understand why any animator needs to draw breasts as big as the characters have here. This is especially disconcerting when they appear on a girl who resembles a 12-year-old. Like, we all know the 4 foot 9 chick with size HHH tits amirite? This isn\u2019t hentai guys, let's at least try to invoke some realism here. Many of you would be quick to respond with, \"well it IS anime\u2026\u201d. This is where I would beg to differ. To me, characters that are drawn closer to a realistic scale are much sexier in anime. If I wanted to look at someone with elephantitis, I'd watch TLC or go to the weird part of Youtube. Who even likes this shit? The rest of the animation, while subpar, isn't anything I'd say was detracting from the show\u2026 unless that is you count the karaoke scenes the animators were too unskilled or lazy to even draw. Or also the inconsistent character model drawings, most specifically in the mall scene when the girls are trying on clothes. Okay, so maybe the animation sucks too. One thing I wasn't sure whether or not was intentional was the censorship. I understand censoring tits or va-jay-jay's, but panty shots too? What gives?! This IS an ecchi right? Show us virgin plebs some goodies!\\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal\u2019s music is exactly what you'd expect from a flashy ecchi show. The OP can't seem to even understand genre of music it is, with cringeworthy dubstep elements thrown in because, ya know it's what the kiddies are listening to nowadays. The ED is a stereotypical scene of a scantily clad Yukane being \u201ccute\u201d... I honestly couldn\u2019t think of any other noteworthy songs in the entire OST, with many droning on like a knockoff DDR track. Cheeky, high pitched vocals with a dose of fast techno bass; the epitome of J-Pop. Voice acting isn't too shabby, and I actually thought Shintara Asanuma\u2019s portrayal of Junichi was above average. Definitely not a soundtrack I\u2019d condone downloading, though it certainly won\u2019t make your ears bleed. \\n\\n\r\nFor as critically bad as it is, I did find some sense of enjoyment in Hajimete no Gal. Through its short run time it did have trouble juggling blatant sex themes with building a believable relationship between the two main characters. At least Junichi learned rather quickly that losing your virginity is not the only important thing out of a relationship. Some people my own age even struggle with that (you know who you are Dave!). I'd recommend this for someone looking for a change of pace, or a good time passer. It's not as hard-core of an ecchi as some anime, but it should scratch the edge of anyone looking for that genre. Until we meet again, thank you for reading!\\n\\n\r\nStory-1\\n\r\nArt-3\\n\r\nSound-4\\n\r\nCharacter-2\\n\r\nEnjoyment-2.5\\n\r\nOverall-2.3",

            "content": "Hajimete no Gal is the perfect representation of the dreck the anime industry tirelessly manufactures: vapid harem twaddle devoid of spirit and interested solely in selling BluRays to wide-eyed otaku who think seeing uncensored anime panties is a wonderful way to spend 5000 yen. The reality is that Hajimete no Gal is worth less than a meal at Matsuya. \r\nThe difference between a harem anime that is well-received versus one that is not is that the popular ones tend to have a certain level of craftsmanship: they look nice-- particularly when focusing on the curvature of the female cast-- and have catchy openings and voiceacting to drive the senses awild. If one was looking simply for some cheaply-produced masturbation fodder, why not, after all, just watch some 'hentai' (as the boys in the west call it) instead?\\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal begs that question repeatedly. \\n\\n\r\nIt is deeply uncertain about whether it wants to be a serious romance or flat-out pornography, and so it attempts to be both. And thus it fails to an almost astounding level. \\n\\n\r\nRepeatedly (often more times in a single episode than can be counted with one hand) the anime will showcase the excessively-censored fantasies of Junichi-- the worthless protagonist-- where Yame and other members of the obligatory harem troupe force themselves on him sexually, begging for sex in the middle of a classroom, a karaoke booth, or some other absurd location that few would ever consider a good idea. Of course this exists because the anime does not have the courage to legitimately have sexual relationships portrayed within the show, and of course it leverages these scenes as an excuse to sell more BluRay copies to sexless otaku who have never walked into an R-18 store before. \\n\\n\r\nThe 'romance' of Hajimete no Gal may well be nonexistent, as Yame and the rest of the female cast never give a single reason for why they are interested in Junichi, much less why they so crave his penis. Yame agrees to go out with him, presumably, because she finds him fun to tease - but then blushes like a 10-year-old at the idea of a kiss. What? I'm sorry, but if you're going to sell an anime on the basis of it having a cast of gal characters - the gal trend being defined by promiscuity - then they should actually be such. If you wish to portray a story with toddlers who think 'indirect kisses' are a thing (and, good lord, this show has that aplenty), then please look to KyoAni's Chuunibyou for inspiration instead of hardcore pornography. \\n\\n\r\nJunichi makes Ichika from Infinite Stratos and Rito from To Love-Ru seem tolerable by comparison. He is a spineless loser whose only goal in life is to lose his virginity (as if anyone in Japan these days actually cares if a high school student hasn't had sex), yet when presented with the opportunity to have sex, cowers like a baby or imposes self-righteousness upon them as if he is now somehow above having sex despite his constant, pathetic attempts at such for the entire series. His friends poke fun at how he might be a cuckold, but in reality, he is the embodiment of one, doing nothing when she sees another man hit on his supposed girlfriend, later throwing a tantrum about how worthless he is and how she deserves that man instead, only to get jealous when he later sees them talk to each other. Whining about how pathetic you are is not an attractive feature, and Yame and crew would do well to leave him aside until he grows up and grows a pair - something unlikely to happen in the event of future seasons. (Let us hope such events never come to pass.)\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is also comprised of cretinous wastes-of-space who do nothing to enhance the quality of the show or make it any less infuriating. You have Nene, the obligatory childhood friend character, massive (and frankly impossibly so) breasts included, who refers to Junichi as \"onii-chan\" and who he of course disregards despite her sex appeal and constant advances because, hey, treating your old friends like trash is a cool thing for anime protagonists to do. Other additions include Yui-- I had to look up her name as I couldn't remember it-- who is conveniently a lewd Nico Nico Douga streamer despite her rich, 'flawless' behavior at school, and Ranko (her name being a pun on the Japanese word for gangbangs...) whose only purpose in the anime is to beat people up, yell at Junichi and attempt to force sex upon him (sometimes both occurring simultaneously). Finally, there is Yame's aforementioned male friend-- a cackling douchebag and dreadful antagonist who behaves in no way resembling an actual human being-- and Junichi's three, pathetic friends who do little else but act jealous towards him and follow him around in the event that one of his harem members might so much as glance in their direction. If the only thing defining these kids and keeping their friendship together is their virginity, then, hey, maybe they were never actually friends in the first place?\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, there are only ten episodes, presumably because they used so many tropes that there are no longer any more cards left to pull from the hat. Onsens scenes, beach scenes where the protagonist lathers lotion onto the girls-- you name it. All the asinine trash the anime industry loves is here for your eyes and ears to feast upon. Hooray. Yahoo.\\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal looks cheap and sounds cheap. None of the fantasy scenes are arousing in any way, nor are the obscured pantyshots the show is so desperately marketing. It has about the same production quality as the average pornographic anime, which makes it a wonder why it couldn't have just been such instead. Even with the decreased characterisation and story a pornographic format would have involved, it would still have been a better anime. At least then it might actually be transparent and honest with itself.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to be quite blunt. Hajimete no Gal sucks. It is not quite abysmal, nor does it win the award for worst harem anime (Infinite Stratos is still a bit more egregious), but it still sucks. Don't watch things that suck.",

            "content": "Watching Hajimete no Gal is like consuming junk food of the worst kind. From the food fast menu, there\u2019s McDonalds, Burger King, KFC, Jack in the Box, Taco Bell, etc. Even among junks, there are sometimes decent ones that can be a guilty pleasure. Unfortunately, Hajimete no Gal is none of that and instead appeals as nothing short than garbage. Without a shadow of a doubt, I can safely say that upon finishing this series, it\u2019s garbage behind comprehension.\r\nFirst, let\u2019s get to the more obvious. The show itself is based on a manga that hasn\u2019t been out too long. (only 2 years in fact) Itmerely has four volumes and yet the producers decided to make this into an anime adaptation. That\u2019s the least of problems though. The real problem begins with the cast of characters. At its core, there\u2019s Junichi Hashibia, a second high school year boy who is an obvious virgin and wants a girlfriend. I can honestly confess that Junichi has some of the worst personalities you can find in anime that\u2019s stitched together into one single entity. The guy has a perverted mind, often clueless about certain situations, and doesn\u2019t seem to excel at anything. He also has some of the most pathetic friends at school and they are no better than him. The only thing that seems to be redeemable about his character is that he is loyal. That actually brings up his involvement with other female characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the cast of girls, we got a variety but the most easily noticeable is Yukana Yame. She\u2019s a gyaru and often attracts the attention of guys and girl alike. Lady luck seems to be on Junichi\u2019s side and Yukana actually decides to be Junichi\u2019s girlfriend. However, their relationship is what I find pretty damn unappealing. Let\u2019s face some facts here because they are nothing really alike. Yukana has school idol-like status while Junichi is a second rate loser. The two have different personalities and doesn\u2019t seem compatible. While the show does give some convincing moments that they can co-exist as a couple, it still doesn\u2019t change the fact that they don\u2019t match. Their character chemistry has very dry humor that often begins from Junichi\u2019s perverted mind or Yukana becoming jealous of other girls. Speaking of the others, the remaining character cast isn\u2019t appealing either. \\n\\n\r\nNene is the typical childhood friend but instead of looking cute and innocent, the show decides to give her enormous boobs and an underage body. Not to mention, she has the personality of a child as she often tries to get Junichi to \u201cravage\u201d her. Yui, the other school idol may seem like an elegant beauty at first. Yet, behind her pretty looks is a girl with a devious personality. Somehow, she believes everyone in the world loves her and she is their master. (well, that is except Junichi) Oh we can\u2019t forget Ranko, the possessive close friend of Yukana. My first impression of her character is that she is an animal. Ranko is very aggressive and wants to protect her territory. In this case, it\u2019s her friend Yukana. Unfortunately, it involves Junichi and the two ends up in some rather compromising positions. So there you have it. Our short yet controversial character cast. Now, if the show actually decided to focus more on characterization, then it would have some chance to salvage itself. Instead, it tries way too hard to appeal to their characters that results in questionable fetishes. I honestly felt uncomfortable watching this show because every episode seems to invite viewers to embrace their atrocious ideas.\\n\\n\r\nThe series\u2019 storytelling is also pretty dreadful. The first few episodes aims at bringing out as much as fetishes as possible. The way it characterizes its female cast makes them look like sex objects. It seems all the guys in the show are perverted in some way or form with their personal desires. Each episode has moments that will show them, sometimes discretely if you pay attention. The overlay of the story seems to focus more on Junichi and Yukana\u2019s relationships development. As I mentioned before, Junichi actually stays pretty loyal to his girlfriend and it\u2019s even more surprising that Yukana is the most mature of the character cast. However, their relationship gets stale real fast. Nothing special really develops between them and instead relies far too much on sexual acts and teasing to do the work. If this show really decided to focus on relationships, at least move outside of Junichi and Yukana\u2019s circle. Instead, the show overemphasizes on their relationship that itself is nothing but generic junk food.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Naz adapts the animation although the visual quality itself is rather mediocre. The male characters look unremarkable with nothing that stands out from their looks. On the other hand, the female cast draws a lot of attention. Yukana is your gyaru girl and probably looks the most convincing compared to the others. The others all look pretty unrealistic. I mean, just look at Nene on that cover. Ranko is somehow allowed to dress like she\u2019s half nude and enter school grounds without trouble. Yui looks normal on the surface but her other appearance looks like some teen idol character. And yes, it\u2019s an ecchi show so expect tons and tons of fan service. The unavoidable beach episode, sexual positions, and lewd character expressions. You name it. It\u2019s there. At many times, it seems the camera is having way too much fun with its angles.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and music will easily be forgettable as the most noticeable sounds of the show is when girls are moaning, yelling, etc. The OP and ED theme songs contains suggestive camera shots while the character voice mannerism all sound off beat. The only voice I can stand in this show is probably Yukana as she surprisingly sounds the most mature. \\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal is a show that I can\u2019t really recommend to anyone unless you like junk and want to increase your watch-list. I mean, it\u2019s only 10-episodes and it doesn\u2019t take long to finish them all. You can even skip every scene that involves Junichi\u2019s male friends as you wouldn\u2019t miss a second of the plot. The plot itself is devoid of development and instead decides to puts its energy into the fan service. Rather than characterization, it decides to saturate them in the most sexual way possible. Hajimete no Gal is one of the very few shows that I gave a 2/10 this year and looking back, I probably won\u2019t regret giving such a score. Oh but \u201cwhy would you waste your time watching this in the first place, Stark?\u201d Honestly, I wanted to see if this show can ever become better than the manga but unfortunately, that\u2019s a distant memory now. This show is junk food and you can easily toss it into the trash after you\u2019re done.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hajimete no Gal....oh what a mess have they done of this funny romcom....\r\nYou see, I wrote a review for the manga quite a while ago, in which I praised the pace and how the charachters were introduced, unfortunately the producers turned this enjoyable manga in an anime who you are supposed to jack off, but you cant pull it off since it's censored all over...marketing strategy? Most likely...\r\nTrust me when I say the censoring is the last thing that bothers me, like I said at the beginning the pacing is horrible, you dont have time to familiarize with the main characters, girls after girls arethrown in the mix, useless monologue of the main character just to add a little more ecchi in the middle and make the episode long enough, the provocative cutness between our two main characters that is in the manga here doesnt exist, and so on....\\n\\n\r\nThere are too many problems with this anime and, to me at least, is impossible to enjoy as much as I did with the manga.\\n\\n\r\nStory (7):\\n\r\nAs previously stated in my manga review the story is the weakest point since it's the usual \"good for nothing guy date a popular girl\", which is not bad if portrayed well.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8):\\n\r\nIt's quite difficult to make a mess of the art these days with all the technology around, luckly they managed to make at least one thing right.\\n\r\nThe art it's standard, clean, dynamic, colorful, typical of most of harem shows.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6):\\n\r\nAs the opening and the ending are not to my tastes I have to admit that the voice actors do a good job, unfortunately the background sounds are pretty much useless as they hardly ever menage to set the mood for the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5):\\n\r\nOne other thing that I appreciated in the manga was the \"mistery vibe\" that our main heroine Yukane Yame was giving. In fact her gal character and her actions didn't match, that made it really interessting and funny, in the anime however she seems just like any other girls with the sole purpose to make Junichi harem bigger. Even the moments where after confessing they slowly start to grow closer are missing, what a shame...\\n\\n\r\nHashiba Junichi in the other hand is our standard harem character, weak, not particularly good at anything.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (3):\\n\r\nI'm not gonna lie here, even witouth reading the manga I would rate this show avarage at best, it's a huge mess, nothing make sense, minutes of daydreaming of sex of our main character, hardly any development shown in the relationship between the two main characters, in the end it's just a bunch of softcore porn thrown here and there to happeal the younger audience. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (4):\\n\r\nSad I couldn't enjoy the show as much as I'm doing with the manga, if you havent watched too many harem/ecchi show however I'm pretty sure you will at least enjoy it more than me.\\n\\n\r\nHave fun! (if you can lol)\\n",

            "content": "\u201cWhy do people fight? Why does war exist? A difference of opinion? A difference of religion? How ridiculous\u2026 I want to show this to those who would wage war - Three goddesses are pressing their boobs against each other. This has the power to rid the world of all its fighting!\u201d\r\nOh boy!\r\nThe season was Summer 2017, a rather disappointing season altogether, with concepts ranging from exciting new worlds to fucking centaur girls and everything in between, giving even the kinkiest of anime fans something to try. But it seemed like none of them could stand apart from the crowd, rise up and be the season\u2019sbeacon of hope for anime fans. Kakegurui\u2019s crazy faces could only go so far, Fate/Apocrypha is a shell of Fate\u2019s former self and My Hero\u2019s Academia\u2019s \u201cTOURNAMENT ARC\u201d ended last season. However, I am here to change all of that, because there is one show that not only gives us the kind of \u201cplot\u201d that we want, but aims to break modern storytelling conventions to create something special. People will write it off as just cheap otaku pandering, but that in itself is just cheap. This show is a misunderstood masterpiece as it makes anime economically a viable option to invest time and money in to. And how does it go about doing that? The only way the industry knows how: ANIME TIDDIES!!!\\n\\n\r\nOk. Enough with the nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can probably tell, Hajimete no Gal has no shame; it\u2019s a show that managed to stand out from every other anime this season purely because of the amount of lewd fan-service jammed into the show. It is an ecchi high school romance-comedy anime produced by Studio Naz. Nothing in that last sentence sounds promising to me as I have only seen one anime before that belonged to those exact genres that I thought was good, that being the extremely sadistic Prison School. And Studio Naz, despite never having seen a show made from them, are responsible for the notorious DRAMA-tical Murder, need I say more. This anime from the start was pinned by many to be disaster, and while I am of the belief that shows that are predominantly ecchi are not inherently bad, I was not looking at this anime with much in the way of expectations. But I still held hope that it would not turn out as a complete disaster. After all, when one first imagines shoving a hotdog up their ass, I would expect the reaction to be rather negative. I mean, who in their right mind would ever shove a hotdog up their ass? But assuming something is different to experiencing it firsthand. Who knows, maybe one would enjoy the feeling of a hotdog inside their ass?  You can never really know unless you try it, so that\u2019s what I did. But not the hotdog part, I\u2019m still not trying that. I watched all 10 episodes of Hajimete no Gal, and this is what I thought:\\n\\n\r\n*NOTE: This review is purely for the subbed version.*\\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal in short, is trash. This just so happened to be one of those times when assuming a show is terrible before you even start was the best course of action for many anime fans. It follows this generic-looking pervy dude in high school named Junichi who has next to no confidence at all and is a virgin \u2013 this feature being seen in a negative light because in this kind of anime, of course it would. He is portrayed as a pathetic loser who\u2019s saddled with a trio of friends even more pathetic that all lust over women, read porno magazines openly and ultimately keep Junichi from having any real chance at getting laid. But one day, the three stooges force Junichi to confess to the sluttiest girl in school that they know as some sort of prank. Junichi being the weakest character in the entire show goes through with it and somehow\u2026 it worked. The \u201cgal\u201d he confessed to, Yukana Yame, knows that all Junichi is after is sex, yet she decides she wants to go out with him. This is implied that she seems to take pleasure in teasing him and making fun of Junichi\u2019s insecure self, but that maybe there\u2019s more to Junichi that Yukana likes that will be developed as the show continues. With this kind of premise, it is obvious that the show is on the trashy side of anime, but the setup did show promise. The relationship at first looked like it could turn out alright, and the way characters were introduced as common caricatures in a harem anime gave the possibility to break the stereotypes within the sub-genre, leaving us with a show that, whilst trashy, has some substance that\u2019s worth the watch. Unfortunately, the hope was all for nought as it turned out to be another shitty harem series.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the first episode, we are shown every female character that will eventually be a part of the harem: the stereotypical main \u201cgal\u201d Yukana, the big-titted loli Nene and Yui, the Asian prefect (who just so happens to be the only female with a cup size below D). Honestly, their appearances are the only features that matter, because when you take away the T&A, they are all basic bitches that are only there for the sake of the harem and that never changes. Remember that these women all have the feelings for Junichi, the pinnacle of \u2018self-insert male protagonist\u2019 that is so bland that in no way can anyone similar to him get the kind of attention he gets. The only female that makes logical sense to be in his harem is G-cup jail-bait Nene, and that is only because of their childhood friendship. Yukana has no sensible reason for spending so much time with Junichi, especially considering how she first met him after seeing him read a porno magazine with the rest of his doofus friends \u2013 the future child offender included. Yui is only after Junichi because of this weird fetish for controlling men like him, despite how Junichi seems to be the only guy in the entire show that she is ever interested in, paying no attention to any of his fellow virgin friends. Yukana\u2019s friend Ranko is another character prevalent in the show and is the only girl that doesn\u2019t want Junichi\u2019s virginity, but she has as much development as the rest of the cast here \u2013 none. Also, fun fact: Ranko\u2019s character design is a rip off of Mito from Food Wars. The only viewers that I can imagine liking these characters are the ones who screenshot specific clips for \u201clater use\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe male characters are no better, with each character being completely one-dimensional, cringeworthy and an embarrassment to any man with integrity watching this. Junichi\u2019s best pal Shinpei has one purpose in this entire show: to act as Junichi\u2019s wingman. You might be thinking somewhere along the lines of \u2018well that\u2019s pretty shit\u2019, but at least he has a reason to be on screen. The blonde-haired guy of the group, Keigo has no reason to even exist! I had to look up his nam because he was so irrelevant. He has so much hollow characterization that he could have switched spots with Junichi as the generic protagonist and the story would have stayed the exact same. But the worst of them has to be Junichi\u2019s fat ass friend Minoru, who openly admits that he is a paedophile with no shame whatsoever. This guy even says that 15 year old girls are \u201ctoo old for him\u201d \u2026 this is a new low folks. What\u2019s even more cringe is how these little shits seem to nearly always talk about online streams of cam girls when together in school. Hajmete no Gal already shows numerous couples groping each other in public in the first 5 minutes. But when it comes to showing how much of a cesspool the setting is, it goes above and beyond, and that does nothing in the long run. It may be laughable at first, but it only adds to the pile of manure that this show shits out on a regular basis. \\n\\n\r\nSaying that the characters was the only problem is a massive understatement to how far down the toilet this shit sank. The plot is fucking horrendous. It tries to show progression with Junichi\u2019s relationship, but only focuses on random events that happen as the couple gets closer with each other. This type of storytelling makes it difficult to structure plot elements unless there\u2019s good writing behind it, but there is nothing that has been said in this review so far that in any way indicates good writing. Overall, the structure is a mess, riddled with contrivances that destroys most of any chance of development for Junichi and Yukana\u2019s relationship. From the very beginning their chemistry is about as authentic as the lead duo from Fifty Shades of Grey and by the end you are either questioning what was the point of all this, or just gave up on the reasoning and continued watching for the \u2018plot\u2019. The dialogue is also dreadful if you ever take the show seriously. And even then, the script writers probably never gave a shit about trying to make anything quality when you hear lines like this come out of nowhere:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cAll I want is a dope pussy to fuck.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAll I want is some god damn respect shown from staff to viewers that take time out of their day to watch this content. But it\u2019s safe to say that this show has no respect for even telling a competent story, let alone its fanbase. The consensus around most harem anime is when you\u2019ve seen one, you\u2019ve seen most, but this is such a failure that it ends up as a shell of the common harem anime. There are a lot of problems with this show, and it does not help that there was only 5 episodes that actually had storyline progression. Yes, out of the 10 episodes the staff had to tell the entire story, only half of it has anything remotely meaningful. Producing Hajimete no Gal like this made everything feel incredibly rushed, to the point where there is no possible way that anyone watching this had time to get invested in these characters and care about what is happening on-screen. But wait, there\u2019s more, because along with a rushed plot, viewers are subjected to watching full filler episodes dedicated to fan-service; the kind of content you would expect from a show like Fairy Tail. From the compulsory beach episode, to the entire harem getting a job at a cosplay caf\u00e9, they are a waste of animation resources. And after persevering to the end, I have concluded that there is nothing that this adaptation did that could be considered a positive \u2013 it is a terrible adaptation and a terrible anime in general!\\n\\n\r\nNow while it is an awful show with nothing redeemable when it comes to story and characters, the animation and sound is what saves Hajimete no Gal from earning a 1/10. The animation style is usually very common with romance-comedy anime: standard designs with bright, dynamic colours.  There were a few jarring points, like how pink lines used for characters blushing go off the side of their face, and the last episode looking more like it came from Chronexia and the Eight Seals. And while it is overall generic and looks very unremarkable compared to similar anime, technically I found it to be just ok. Maybe I have just become desensitised to anime breasts drawn the size of watermelons but it never bothered me anymore than how sloppy the writing was. However, there is something that I want to get off my chest and that is how there is an uncensored version of Hajimete no Gal that has no reason to exist. I watched the uncensored version, therefore I expected uncensored material, yet all I saw were a couple panty shots that got censored in the \u2018safer\u2019 version. How in the world are you going to censor panty shots in an ecchi show? Even worse, there\u2019s still censorship in the NSFW version. What the fuck!? So even if you were only watching it for a weekly wank, you\u2019d probably have better luck with a handful of other anime from this season. Kakegurui would be a better choice for that reason, even with the \u2018look at me I\u2019m so CRAZZY!!!1!\u2019 expressions. Sound-wise, it\u2019s fine: J-pop opening and ending with basic OST\u2019s, nothing more. Voice-acting was good, with emotions coming through the characters well. Production-wise, it\u2019s fairly competent, and I would be lying if I did not say that I thought some moments were absolutely hilarious. The best scene overall was definitely in episode 6 when one of Junichi\u2019s friends dressed up as Kirito from SAO in an attempt to impress some ladies, comedy gold! Sadly that moment only lasts for 10 seconds, and those kind of moments cannot compensate for how terrible the show was overall and in no way saves this show from damnation. \\n\\n\r\nAnd thus, these are my thoughts of Hajimete no Gal. There is more that I could have stated, but honestly this show is not worth any more time and effort that has already been given. The show is a throwaway anime that lives solely to sell blow-up sex dolls and lewd posters of the female characters to otaku fans that will buy into this garbage every season. It is a piece of trash that continues to wear down the ecchi genre and ultimately makes me ashamed to be a fan of anime in general. My advice: Don\u2019t watch it, and if you do want to watch it, stop, and go back to my original advice. Unless you plan on watching the dub, and even then, only watch if you're in the mood for some trash.\\n",

            "content": "NAZ, a studio I never expected to come back since Hamatora.\r\nI was very surprised to hear that this got an anime, and boy did my perverted side come into light. An anime about a virgin on his journey to step into the region of adulthood.\r\nI feel like ecchi doesn't get the love it deserves. Of course, being an ecchi series, it's understandable. It's been done a lot and might be annoying to some, which I guess makes sense.\r\nThe story is simple. Our MC was forced to confess to a gal, Yukana. Yukana with gigantic titties decides then to tease him and then eventually, Hashiba (ourMC) gets the girl. Congrats?!\\n\\n\r\nWith this a start of a crazy yet amazing relationship begins, as well as some relationships breaking.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the fat pedophile, the other side character friends are quite enjoyable to watch. They support him and Yukana as well as despises him for it. \\n\\n\r\nThis is because they never thought Junichi would be able to pull it off, jealousy from the 2 is inevitable once you get a big, pretty gal like Yukana.\\n\\n\r\nAs dumb and generic it is, I really enjoy the interactions between Yukana and Junichi. It seems like what a nice, cute relationship would look like (of course, minus the fantasies and teasing Junichi has and Yukana does). But I really do like Yukana's character, She's kind hearted and I guess really loves our MC and tries to do what she can to get closer.\\n\\n\r\nHaving read the manga tho, the adaptation was solid, now some parts are either skipped or re-arranged. I really hope it's the latter. Besides that, some characters look different. But I didn't care all too much. But Junichi's childhood friend really needs to see a doctor. I don't understand how she can even walk.\\n\\n\r\nWhatever happens in the future is truly up to the 2 and how they decide to direct their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nIn Conclusion, the anime has its points. The guilty pleasure of Summer, with some nice ecchi. Ecchi haters stay away, and perverts go all the way! This anime is for all perverted needs. But as well as nice character interactions. So enjoy it! Enjoy it for its ecchiness!",

            "content": "Girlfriends, boyfriends, I\u2019m sure most of us have wanted one at some point, or already have one. For those of us who don\u2019t have one, do not fret, Hajimete no Gal is here to indulge you into the experience of having a girlfriend or boyfriend, whether you want it or not. This will not be a painless experience however, so strap yourself in and prepare for the worst, and I mean it.\r\nImagine this: You are just an ordinary guy, and your classmates forced you to ask a hot girl in your class to date you. After she almost turns you down like the loser youare, she instead decides to accept becoming your girlfriend, but is it too good to be true? In most cases, yes, this would be too good to be true, however, in Hajimete no Gal we say \"screw the rules! \"and make the unlikely happen.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the premise may seem enticing at first, the show doesn\u2019t do much to expand on it, leaving you with an empty shell of nothingness for a majority of the show. If you\u2019ve seen at least a couple harem/ecchi anime before, then you\u2019ll probably see the pattern Hajimete follows through its episodes. This doesn\u2019t mean that it has nothing going for it, because it does. Every episode centers on our main character experiencing something new for the first time, whether that is visiting his girlfriend\u2019s house, going to karaoke or even getting a job. Of course, you also have your obligatory beach episode that every harem/ecchi seems to have, but I won\u2019t get into that too much, since I don\u2019t mind it.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is the pacing, it feels really rushed. One moment the characters are doing something random, and in the next scene something dramatic happens without leaving any time to digest what happened. This wouldn't be a problem if the show in question was all about the randomness like Nichijou, but when you add a random element to what seems to be a semi-serious show, at least for me it doesn't work at all.\\n\\n\r\nIf you thought you were going to get some nice uncensored scenes, then think again. I watched the uncensored version, but instead of being presented with uncensored material, they instead decided to censor a guy\u2019s boner through his pants, because that\u2019s totally the best way to make someone interested in your show. The censored version is even worse by the way, they censor stuff like the girl\u2019s panties for no reason, which is a big no-no for me especially when it\u2019s an ecchi show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are for the most part dull and forgettable. The male characters except for the main character don\u2019t really serve a purpose except for being there, which of course entails in almost no character development whatsoever. There\u2019s even a literal pedophile saying that he only wants to fuck little girls, and that 15 year olds are too old for him. There\u2019s not much else to say about them other than that you can literally replace them with clones of Ichika from Infinite Stratos and the experience wouldn\u2019t change that much.\\n\r\nThe females are for the most part attractive, if you ignore their humongous almost Eiken-level boobs and the fact that their personalities are barely there. If you\u2019ve even seen a screenshot from the show, or even the cover, you should know what I\u2019m talking about. They feel unnaturally large, especially for high schoolers, since you are not supposed to have such big boobs when you\u2019re between 16 and 18 years old, but hey, what do I know, right? This is anime we\u2019re talking about, where the impossible can happen at any time because the creator allows for it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it isn\u2019t that bad, but it doesn\u2019t stand out either. There was never a moment where I went \u201cwow, this is totally worth it for the art\u201d instead it was kind of just meh. It serves a purpose, but don\u2019t expect anything fancy, since you\u2019ll be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening was decent enough, and I actually liked the ending theme, it was catchy and felt like a nice end to each episode. Other than that, the rest of the OST was pretty forgettable, mostly just common background music for the sake of having music.\\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal had some okay moments, but the sheer amount of pointless scenes, straight up useless characters and unnecessary censorship pushes my buttons just a little bit too far, and in the end it was a massive disappointment. What could have been an interesting and creative take on the genre instead becomes your run of the mill harem/ecchi show with too many dumb things to explain. If you can, stay away from this show, it is really bad.\\n",

            "content": "To start out, I need to establish that this is a review of the anime's dub. I'll explain why later in the review. Along with that, this will also include spoilers, although I doubt they would really change your viewing experience.  \r\nTo enjoy this show, one must understand it is not meant to be taken seriously. The girls have unconventionally large breasts, and the plot is not the deepest thing in the world, but it's hilarious. I found myself sending quotes from it to my friends just because I was dying from amusement at what they'd say, especially for an American. I amnot knowledgeable about pop culture from other countries, but this dub was filled with pop cultural references and jokes.  \\n\\n\r\n- A Yoda impression \\n\r\n- Mentioning fidget spinners  \\n\r\n- \"The bomb dot com\" \\n\r\n- \"Snaps to chat\" \\n\r\n- \"You wanna know my bra size? 36 Double Deez Nuts\" \\n\r\n- Saying \"Do you wanna build a sand castle\" to the tune of a song from the Disney movie, Frozen \\n\r\n- \"The problem is that you've got a bone where your hot dog should be.\" \\n\r\n- \"Bae stealing b to the itch\" \\n\r\n- \"Shady af\" \\n\r\n- \"#NoFilter #Seriously\" \\n\r\n- \"Great googley moogley, I get to touch her\" \\n\r\n- \"We'll watch your junk anytime.\" \\n\r\n- And many more \\n\\n\r\nThese are unique to the dub. To compare the sub to the dub, in the first episode there are two couples, from whom we can hear the conversations of.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the sub they say: \\n\r\nFemale 1: Let\u2019s go to the amusement park this weekend. \\n\r\nMale 1: Sure. And we\u2019ll spend the night together, right? \\n\r\nFemale 2: There\u2019s an event for couples tomorrow. \\n\r\nMale 2: Guess I\u2019ll have to take you then. \\n\\n\r\nIn the dub, it goes: \\n\r\nFemale 1: Let\u2019s go to the amusement park Saturday morning! \\n\r\nMale 1: Sure, and I\u2019ll show you my log ride Saturday night. \\n\r\nFemale 2: Did you hear it\u2019s couples only night at the movie theater?  \\n\r\nMale 2: You are going to get so felt up.  \\n\\n\r\nOne of these is clearly more entertaining, and that is the English dub.  \\n\\n\r\nI'm an English speaker, I wish I knew Japanese, but I do not. That being said, I can understand more when there is emphasis of English words better than Japanese words. This lead to a better understanding of the story through each of the seiyuu's voices. I can't distinguish between different Japanese dialects, but the Gals in the anime all sounded like the stereotypical 'Valley Girl' as you would call it in America. They said 'like' a lot, their whole tone of voice was spot on and it made the girls sound believable.  \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the girls, the characters were actually a lot of fun to watch. They were not the most original cast, but they worked so well together in my opinion. The girls didn't all just act the same, even though they were all gals. The main girl, she was not a slut, she wanted a proper relationship with him, which was contrary to popular belief. Her best friend was a lesbian, or at least bisexual. MC's childhood friend became a gal so he would notice her. And the girl who was like the class rep. with good grades and stuff, had a princess complex and was a secret gal. That's not all. The friends of the mc, they were the nerdiest virgins ever, which made them believable. They worked at manga cafes, they made the mc confess, one  only likes loli, etc.. If that doesn't convince you then think of how they interact together. It is so easy to image these characters in real life, just hanging out with each other. Their interactions didn't seem forced, (Unless it was the first time they were interacting for the most part.)  \\n\\n\r\nWhile the art is heavily focused on ecchi, it doesn't change the comedic aspects of the show, if anything it makes them better. The mc frequently leers at their breasts, and everybody jokes about it and calls him a virgin. Without the disproportionately large breasts, one of the more basic comedic properties would be gone, and the jokes inside the show would have to cease.  \\n\\n\r\nThe jokes, references, characters and art are all big components of the anime, but there is still the storyline that has gone unmentioned. The show starts off with the mc having to confess to somebody most people see as a slut so that he could finally have sex. But the story is better than that. They go out and have fun, the anime isn't just a bunch of sex, there is actually no sex in it, no matter how much he wants it. The other girls try to initiate sexual interaction throughout the show, but the mc is better than that, he starts liking his girlfriend more, to the point that he doesn't just want to have sex with any girl, he wants her. He loves her. The highest point in the series is when they kiss for the first time. Even though this was a comedic series, and the mc was super perverted, I couldn't help but root for him and hope that he would get a happy ending with her.  \\n\\n\r\nThe bottom line, is that this is a fantastic show, if you love comedy, slightly perverted jokes, ecchi, or a slice of life series that isn't super innocent.  \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I can not stress enough how important is is to watch the dub.",

            "content": "Hajimete no Gal - Something Different\r\nWhy do people like ecchi series? Is it because of the boobs, the girls or the story? Personally, I think it's because it's a funnier and an easier genre to appreciate, as being a reliable and a fun combination. And there's nothing wrong with the liking of some ecchi series, including Hajimete no Gal and by that, I'm another one that thinks that ecchi doesn't get the love it deserves.\r\nThis story for Hajimete no Gal, as for some others series by the same genre, appears to be simple. Our main protagonist (named Junichi) is forced by his friends to confessto a gal named Yukana and then, by surprising, he gets the girl in exchange for some conditions. So Junichi is our male protagonist and he wants to try getting a girlfriend to help him with his insecurity. The girl, Yukana, on the contrary, it's a more interesting character, because she likes to tease him and seems very confident when she's doing it giving an idea or her life's experience.\\n\\n\r\nI think this is what people want when they are searching for a funny romance story with a bit of fanservice and with a perfect pacing for 10 episodes. It also has a great opening and ending song, which combines with the series as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nApparently, this is one of the best adaptations in this season also including the adaptation of the Kakegurui manga. This adaptation even has some parts that are skipped or re-arranged from the original manga but doesn't seem to be a problem. So yeah, apparently the manga is better so make sure to check out.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8 | Art: 9 | Sound: 9 | Character: 9 | Enjoyment: 8 \\n\r\nScore: 9\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Note: It's my new guilty-pleasure, thank you Ueno Meguru sensei.

            "content": "This. Is. Trash. Personally, I'm not a big fan of calling anime trash because I know that even if I don't personally like it there are likely others who do like it, and that enjoyment of it provides enough benefits to those watchers that at the very least they have a purpose. But this anime is the truest definition of trash. Not only is it devoid of anything that could be considered quality but it is massively insulting to its subject matter, to its viewers, and to anyone that could have the grave misfortune of watching this anime.\r\nWhere does it go wrong? A better questionwould be where does it go right. Just one look at it and you can likely already tell a big problem. Lots of big exposed breasts, an ecchi tag. This would lead one to think its a show that doesn't even try to be good, that uses fanservice and oversized breasts to sell copies. A show without any artistic integrity. And all of that is true. But that oversells it. There are many shameless ecchi series that have no thought put into their plot or story and try to get by fanservice. And certainly most of them aren't good, but there are two key differences. One, that even amongst those shows Hajimete no Gal is significantly lacking in quality. Two, those anime aren't insulting unlike Hajimete no Gal.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you look at the main character and his friends it's hard not to see this show as insulting to its primary demographic. The main character's bros are all a bunch of creeps who's ideas about girls are problematic. It's clear from the very first episode that they seem them as nothing more than as sex objects. The first episode has them talking about women's breasts as if that's all that matters. (To them a girl without breasts has no value and isn't worth their attention.) Even when getting close to some girls, or at least having the option to, they still seem more interested in seeing them naked, making them kiss each other, or just watching them in bikinis, more than they do interacting with them. It's as if they solely exist just for their amusement. It's disgusting. And let's not forget about the oversized acorn whose sole purpose in the show is to talk about how much he likes elementary school aged girls, and wants to love them. Yup, you heard me right. And he does nothing else but that. I'm not sure what the point of his character is because it's not funny! He even gets a job at a day care. Why do they let this happen? And while the MC is not like that himself, he still hangs around these guys. He excuses their behaviour even though it's the type of garbage that should be disavowed. Besides he's not really that different himself. He frequently thinks of his own girlfriend in ways that can get him laid or get him to see her panties. He only decides to drag out his \"confession\" to her so he can catch more glances of her panties. He may be better but he's still pretty much scum.\\n\\n\r\nYou may look at these characters and wonder why they're so insulting. They're just characters, right? Well, think about how harems work. They operate on the idea of a self-insert protagonist. You're supposed to be inserting yourself into this loser. The audience is supposed to be able to relate to these people. Furthermore, this is the anime's interpretation of otaku. As men deluded with the outside world that are unable to see it as anything more than fuel for their boners. How is that not insulting? Not to mention, completely wrong. \\n\\n\r\nI shouldn't need to explain how this show is insulting to women. Between the male characters opinions and attitudes on them and the typical fanservice it should be pretty obvious. I'm not one to think that fanservice is inherently insulting to women but in a show like this, it is. When the main role of them seems to be them being slobbered over it's hard not to find it insulting. Especially when every male character in the series is playing 3D chess to try to get them to do something lewd or to see their naked body. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then the obvious, it's insulting to the viewer because it doesn't give a damn about quality. Now this maybe true of other shows. But when you combine it with how insulting it is it all builds up to be an insulting superpower. Hajimete no Gal isn't conserned with being good. It isn't even conserned with being nice. It's selling sleazeballs and fanservice and hoping that it'll work out well enough. They don't even follow the manga well and instead replace it with this drivel. Is there no stop to their insult brigade?\\n\\n\r\nYou may get it now that it's insulting, but how about that quality? \\n\\n\r\nWell it's terrible. The characters are boring and under developed. Only the main Gal girl has enough going for her to make her interesting and even with that, she isn't. Most of the plot is the type of stuff that is found in most generic harems. I don't need to go into it because if you have watched any other generic harem you'll already know what this'll be like. And if you haven't then I suggest you watch those other more popular harems instead because they play them so much better. Situations arise just to give the MC more girls in his harem, as well as to push as much fanservice as possible. What makes Hajimete no Gal special is that the harem comedy scenes feel so much more unrealistic than normal. It all feels like a set up to terrible jokes (that have been done a thousand times before no less) and fanservice. None of it feels natural or feels like the natural reaction of the characters. At least most harems are able to get that part right and feel real even if they are trashy. \\n\\n\r\nFor some reason Hajimete no Gal also tries to do a more serious romance arc which not only clashes against its lighthearted comedy base but is also completely mangled and poorly done. The reactions of the characters are overblown for the sake of driving the narrative and it's hard to believe that everything so conveniently fits into the storyline they want. It's bad writing 101. They even add in an obviously bad baddie because screw nuance. \\n\\n\r\nAnd for a fanservice anime, it doesn't look pretty at all. At least if the animation and art were nice there would be a point to watch this but it all looks pretty ugly, and if you watch with the censors it takes it up to nauseating. For a show that relies on fanservice the art needs to be good or else what is the point of that. Apparently Hajimete no Gal missed the memo on that because it didn't even try.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's basically what it is, an insulting stupid generic harem comedy that has no idea how to write any part of itself well. Please for your own sanity don't watch it. I'm sure that there is something much better for whatever reason that you would want to watch this show. Please watch that instead and leave this to die. The less that watch this drivel, the better.",

            "content": "Overall i'd give this anime a 7 which for me means it was simply an Enjoyable ride. Many of the Harsh reviews are from people that came into this anime with huge misconceptions that'd it'd be extremely \"Ecchi\" maybe some nudity etc and or the majority that have only seen the obnoxious \"Censored\" version\" which takes away from a shows overall quality. That being said i watched the unscensored version and this anime is far from being very ecchi and maybe only has 1-2 episodes with anything more than a standard \"panty shot\". This anime has 0 real nudity so don't expect that and tbhtheres no reason for it to even be censored in the first place. Saenai Heroine was probably 2-3x as much ecchi/fanservice as this show to be entirely honest and that show has 0 censoring. I feel as though many people expected this to have Highschool DxD levels of fanservice etc and were rather let down by that bc at the end of the day this anime is purely an awkward love story of young teenagers trying to understand what it takes to make a relationship work. \\n\r\n-In conclusion if you're looking for Highschool DxD lvls of fanservice and ecchi this anime is not for you.\\n\r\n-If you don't like love stories and light melodrama in an episode or 2 then this anime is not for you.\\n\r\n-If you're okay with taking a fun light hearted/slight ecchi/feelgood anime for what it is and not expecting some profound levels of backstory then this if for you.\\n\r\n-If you like a funny supporting cast that at times comes off as quite odd then this is for you.\\n\r\n-If you sympathize with any type of first love stories this is for you.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion this anime is \"Good\" but its far from great and tbh the Manga did it a lot better. Overall 10 episodes should have been 12 so they wouldn't cut corners from the Manga but it still remains a decent adaptation. As i said take this anime for what it is and you'll love it but put it under a critics microscope and nitpick every little thing and you probably won't. 7/10\\n",

            "content": "I\u2019m quite picky when it comes to anime I watch, but I can forgive plenty of short comings : I can forgive plot-holes, underdeveloped characters, minor animation issues, cliches and archetypes (to a degree)... It obviously depends on the nature of the show - for a story-heavy show, which puts proper delivery, tempo and relationships between the characters at the top, lack of development of the characters themselves can be devastating. \r\nI also seldom give extreme ratings when I\u2019m asked to grade a show, a video game or any other piece of media, because it takes a particular effort to make something absolutely unbelieveable,be it a masterpiece or a complete trainwreck. In many cases, a show is bad, but it\u2019s not the end of the world, and in the end, it\u2019s likely I\u2019ll forget about it\u2019s existence soon after I finish watching it. Same with good shows - there are a ton of genuinely good, fun anime out there, many of which can\u2019t compete with the absolute top contenders cause they just don\u2019t quite have that special something - maybe it\u2019s the visuals that are just a bit short of greatness, might be that the story is not as interesting or the execution in general falls short. \\n\\n\r\nThere also hasn\u2019t yet been a show that I genuinely hated as a whole entity. I despised parts of it (like the main protagonist in High School DxD - a comparison that will be repeated in this review) but I've never despised a show so deeply that I utterly refused to find something that didn\u2019t suck about it.\\n\\n\r\nUntil now.\\n\\n\r\nI dislike SAO. I dislike The Asterisk War. I dislike all the generic action/harem shows flooding the Light Novel and anime markets lately. I dislike the cheaply made ecchi shows, selling themselves on absolutely nothing but said ecchi content. \\n\\n\r\nBut Hajimete no Gal is a unique specimen. This is one of a kind, and it\u2019ll most likely remain that way until the end of time.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a cataclysm of such epic proportions that putting it in mere words is a truly Herculean task, one that makes me almost humbled by how tiny I am in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nHave you ever seen a piece of media with absolutely zero value? No entertainment, no lessons to be learned, no new skill to aquire, just plain nothing. An empty hole, with no creativity, interesting ideas, new concepts and no utter lack of effort in putting it all together, in making it even slightly cohesive.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not speaking about something that you\u2019d call \u201cbad\u201d or even \u201chorrible\u201d. I\u2019m taking about something PARTICULARILY vile. A show that made you remember all the 1/10 stuff you\u2019ve experienced and literally caused you to look at it with far more favourable eye, purely because they weren\u2019t \u201cthat\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal is such show for me. This little gem combines every single thing I despise with blind, overwhelming fury and skillfully blends it into a shit-shake the likes of which I never expected possible to create. It looks like shit. It sounds like shit. It\u2019s content is nothing but a shitflood after a shitflood, and the worst thing is, this will not be the last one of it\u2019s kind. \\n\\n\r\nEnter Junichi Hashiba. Junichi is a high school boy who really, really wants to have a girlfriend. He also has a group of friends, who also wish they had girlfriends. So one day, they decide to play a prank on the innocent little Junichi and pair him up with a gal (or \u201cgyaru\u201d, since we need a proper cultural term for it to matter in this case) by putting a letter in her locket, asking her to meet Junichi behind school.. Their plan to seemingly screw their friend over fails however, as the lass actually agrees to date Junichi. If this description sounds bland and uninteresting, it\u2019s because that\u2019s what it is. And once you actually see it in motion, it gets even worse. And then it continues to accelerate downhill at an alarming pace.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with Junichi himself. I\u2019m deeply convinced that current LN market has some sort of a vendetta against young schoolboys, since they seem to be trying to make them as utterly repulsive and unlikeable as they possibly can. And I can fucking assure you, they\u2019re succeeding so much it\u2019s getting worrying. I know this theory sounds idiotic, but how else would you explain the absolute avalanche of protagonists that are utterly useless as both people AND a mean to advance the storyline further? \\n\\n\r\nSo Junichi is yet another one of those eternal virgin protagonists who have never dated anybody, think mostly about sex and are pitiful when it comes to their contacts with the opposite sex. And I just realized that this entire sentence could\u2019ve ended at \u201canother one\u201d and it wouldn\u2019t lose anything from it\u2019s meaning. That\u2019s really what this dude should be named. \u201cAnother-one-kun\u201d. There\u2019s nothing remotely notable or interesting about him or anything he does. Everything he does and says is a gigantic cliche, used with the subtlety of getting a concrete block dropped on your crotch. We\u2019ve got all the ingredients to make LN protagonist here : constant blushing and stuttering, ridiculously exaggerated reactions, repeated to the point of giving the viewer a desperate death wish, sexual thoughts and delusions - because let\u2019s call things by their proper name for once - nothing\u2019s off limits here. The only missing ingredient here are superpowers pulled from the ass dimension, given to him for no possible reason other than because he happens to be the main character. But thankfully it\u2019s a slice-of-life show, so those are (mostly) out of the question.\\n\\n\r\nBut I kind of wish they weren\u2019t. If they did appear, it would only mean more reasons for me to tear this show to shreds, and even less reasons to feel bad while loudly disclaiming just how horrible it is. \\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one character Junichi reminds me of, it\u2019s the other high school cataclysm from one of the favourite wank-fuels of the modern youth, Issei Hyoudou from High School DxD. He was almost as big of a piece of shit as well, and he was the main reason why I dropped DxD halfway through the second season. But for all of his annoying \u201chilarious pervert\u201d act, I must admit that Issei at least TRIED, you know? I think they all TRIED to make him at least a decent character. He genuinely worked hard to improve himself, and for all of his perviness, he did respect the harem he got, never making a move without being allowed to. And as much as I hated them, some of his sex-driven reactions were actually kind of funny. \\n\\n\r\nBut \u201cmaking a move\u201d isn\u2019t something you should expect from our holy maiden here. He\u2019s far too busy being useless and getting constantly flustered over gestures and, well, just about anything concerning women. For a man so hell-bent on starting a relationship with a woman, he sure doesn\u2019t seem particularily interested in actually progressing said relationship forward. One could wonder if his awkwardness is, perhaps, caused by dating a woman he hasn\u2019t exactly chosen himself. Love is a complicated feeling, after all, and at a young age we don\u2019t quite understand how it works yet.\\n\\n\r\nBut both you and me know that\u2019s not the case. The purpose of Junichi acting like a sexless weirdo is because this is what is expected of a LN protagonist being a part of an ecchi story. We\u2019ve accepted this, we\u2019ve all embraced this at one point or another, and so now this is what we\u2019ll have to deal with. \\n\\n\r\nOn the opposide end we\u2019ve got the main girl of this mess, Yukana Yame. She\u2019s a gal. She has a sexy body, and she\u2019s supposedly different from gals in general. We use the term \u201cgal\u201d here to describe a specific subculture and fashion style, and the show\u2019s entire premise hinges on the concept of breaking stereotypes, I suppose. So gal can be roughly compared to what us Westerners would call a \u201cdumb blonde\u201d stereotype : not very intelligent but hot, has a rather casual approach to sex, dresses provocatively etc. Of course it\u2019s a little bit more complex than this, and has it\u2019s own little quirks, but I won\u2019t dive that deep here. She show surely doesn\u2019t do that too much, so it would only be a waste of time. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters are concerned, Yukana is definitely the best one in this show. She isn\u2019t immediatelly hateable and I believe that with some more skilled writing, she could be made into a pretty interesting girl that would deserve being placed in a better show. She\u2019s also the most visually impressive. And I\u2019m not talking about her body specifically, but about the way she was drawn - her model has by far the highest quality out of anybody else (at least when she\u2019s wearing her school uniform - everything else looks like shit), and the reason is obvious - she\u2019s the main draw of the show. \\n\\n\r\nHer personality... Well, she\u2019s a gal. She\u2019s into fashion, she has blonde hair, dresses sexily, has a friend she hangs out with on a regular basis but, in an unexpected turn of events, turns out she\u2019s actually rather guarded about sex itself. This is the entire plot of this anime : there\u2019s a girl who \u201cshould be\u201d into sex, but is reserved and shy about it. Knowing this, you might think that the main plot point of the anime is not judging people by stereotypes, and to give everybody a chance. You\u2019d think that, but I think it\u2019s clear by now that this show isn\u2019t good enough to handle an idea like this with any degree of proficiency. And if it isn\u2019t clear, it will become clear soon enough.\\n\\n\r\nBonus point earned in the dubbed version : she\u2019s voiced by Jamie Marchi, who you might known from voicing Rias Gremory. And she does fit the role very well. The dialogue is also translated/rewritten to be fittingly cringy, pretentious and difficult to stomach. But the actress herself did a good job. I really do suggest watching this show dubbed, cause with subs it\u2019s not only offensive but just plain boring (see, an upgrade from HS DxD - that one was just boring when subbed).\\n\\n\r\nI was really trying to describe the characters properly and give a wider idea about them, but I find it irrationally difficult. It might be because of how bland and uninteresting they are in general. And you\u2019d think it would be a bad thing, for the main characters to be so horribly written.\\n\\n\r\nFret not, for the writers have prepared a much better feast for us - supporting characters in this show are the absolute powerhouse of it. And as should be expected by now, not in a good way.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, let us take a look at the previously mentioned group of friends Junichi hangs out with.\\n\r\nThere\u2019s three of them, and every single one is equally abhorrent for a completely unrelated reason.\\n\\n\r\nOpening our trifecta of twattery is the Glasses Dude. He acts as the quasi-leader of the group and is a curious patchwork of a salty virgin, generic pervert and the self-proclaimed romance expert - despite having no experience whatsoever. He talks the most and is the most annoying of the bunch, but otherwise has no obviously offending qualities, aside from the lack of any good ones. But this is the case for everybody here, so I\u2019ll let it slide.\\n\\n\r\nThe middle man would be the Loli Lover, and this nickname is much darker and uncomfortable than you\u2019d expect it to be. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we have the first case of conscious pedophilia in anime (aside from hentai and maybe less known adult-rated shows). The creators of this bog had the perfect idea of taking an artstyle/fetish that\u2019s controversial and divisive by default and then crank it up a notch or twelve. So our man makes it abundantly clear from the absolute start - as if, the first FIVE MINUTES of the first episode - that he\u2019s a follower of the old Catch-Em-Young school of dating, precisely stating that it would be perfect if his girlfriend was around 5th grade. That would be around 10-11 years old, just to clear things out. I shouldn\u2019t even have to tell you what is wrong with this, but this is anime, so I\u2019ll do it anyway - it\u2019s creepy as shit. It\u2019s one thing when a character is drawn in a loli manner cause she\u2019s, say, of a petite build like the girls from K-on or Gabriel Dropout. But when we\u2019re talking actual elementary school kids, it gets uncomfortable. Aside from that however, there\u2019s nothing else here. \\n\\n\r\nAnd closing the ranking is the last member of the Circle of Bad Fucking Ideas. He is a different specimen entirely, as it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve come across a character this uninteresting and lacking any shade of personality - and remembering how many shitty harems, romance/ecchi shows and hentais exist, this is a big statement for sure, and one I\u2019m confident in. When the first man was the leader, the third one can be seen as the acting hand of the group, notable in that he was the one who placed the love letter in Yukana\u2019s locker. He might have done something more than this over the course of the series, but I doubt it was anything significant and I can\u2019t be asked to find out. Of the three, he\u2019s has the least offensive qualities, purely because there\u2019s barely any qualities in him to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nAnother notable character here is the resident loli, Nene Fujinoki. Before we get into anything regarding what she\u2019s like, I need to point out one important thing - her visual design.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t watched the show, or don\u2019t remember the characters (not bloody surprising, this fact...) just type her name into Google Images and get a good look at her.\\n\\n\r\nJust look.\\n\\n\r\nThe words \u201choly\u201d and \u201cshit\u201d spring to mind. There\u2019s exaggeration, there\u2019s fetishization, and then there\u2019s THIS.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just to drive the point home - this is commercial. As if, somebody was hired to create a character like this. \\n\\n\r\nSomebody drew this. SOMEBODY GOT PAID FOR DRAWING THIS. SOMEBODY\u2019S FUTURE EMPLOYERS WILL SEE THIS AS A PART OF THEIR PORTFOLIO.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve ever felt bad about your work and life choices - remember, at least you\u2019re not that artist...\\n\\n\r\nSo our Z-cup girl here takes the role of the supposed little sister character, barring the fact she and Junichi are literally unrelated in any way - they\u2019re just childhood friends and she acts like his little sister because a check-list required an imouto character to be present, so one has been provided. She\u2019s really into him and spends the show trying to change her style to appeal to him more, but since the main couple is established from the very beginning, it\u2019s obvious that it won\u2019t ever lead anywhere. And this is one thing I kind of need to note - the lack of most of the harem bullshit infesting shows of this nature. Although it doesn\u2019t make it any better, it at least isn\u2019t making it worse. Hardly a praise, but you can\u2019t be picky when we\u2019re dealing with a show where the first frame you see is a close-up of the main girl\u2019s camel toe.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some more characters here, like the main girl\u2019s friend, who gets pissed/jealous cause her gal friend spends less time with her now, so she tries to make the main couple break up by implying Junichi is cheating on Yukana (read - she\u2019s trying to basically rape him) but it never works, another girl from Junichi\u2019s class who\u2019s apparently into cosplay, but we won\u2019t find anything interesting enough to justify such analysis, so let\u2019s move to the next source of constant torment - the visuals.\\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned earlier, Yukana is the only remotely good thing in this show, and sadly, when we look at the visual design itself, this proves true again. While the models themselves aren\u2019t horrible, animation is. Often there\u2019s barely any movement in the scenes, which is particularily notable during face close-ups, and the level of clumsiness gives the works of A-1 Pictures and Studio Deen serious competition. Particularily, there\u2019s that one scene where Yukana goes shopping with Junichi and that other gal girl to look for clothes, and when she picks up a dress, she suddenly looks like she has a completely different body type. Her chest in particular grows to ridiculous size - and yeah, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s flat, but in her uniform her breasts look at least slightly reasonable.The scenes show severe lack of budget and possibly time as well, but for a show like this, it\u2019s not surprising. I doubt anybody was expecting it to be any successful in the first place, so the creators propably decided to take what they could, putting as little money as possible into it, to ensure it\u2019ll run profit even without being largely successful (and somehow it still gained following of sorts...).\\n\\n\r\nSounds design isn\u2019t much better. It just kind of \u201cis there\u201d, so the show doesn\u2019t feel even emptier than it already is. The opening theme is a generic, cutesy j-pop song with nothing appealing whatsoever, and at several times, what I\u2019d refer to as \u201cstock sounds\u201d are used when characters are falling, for example. I know it\u2019s not exactly like every studio records different sounds for every single possible thing happening in the show, but in this particular case, it yet again painfully reminds you how little effort was put when making it. It isn\u2019t even that B-class badness some of you might know. The cheesy, overused stuff that still has some charm to it. This is just bad. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m mad that shows like this still keep popping up, but above everything, it saddens me. It saddens me that shows like this is what people who wish to get into anime might get recommended as one of their first shows. It saddens me that crap like this frequently steals the spotlight from better, much more deserving shows. It saddens me how much damage it does to art, character development, humour and ecchi elements, all of which can be used well in a good show to, if not improve it, then at least help it keep consistent quality. \\n\\n\r\nAnd this crap sells. It pulls views, it pulls numbers, and it\u2019s horrifying. Because with this being the case, it will not be the last one of it\u2019s kind. And somehow, I get the feeling it will not remain the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen for too long. And knowing how rarely I give extreme ratings, I\u2019m absolutely mortified.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s not even like I hate shows of fanservicey nature with simple plots and character development. One of my favourite shows is Shinmai Mao no Testament, which is exactly that. It features young, attractive cast, strong male hero, lots of action and sexy scenes, while also having only 12 episodes (with second season, though). But Testament isn\u2019t a bad show. It\u2019s has plenty of problems, but the main character is humble, likeable and capable. It\u2019s not difficult to understand his reasoning and genuinely like and cheer for him. While the female cast here suffers from being very mediocore - with one exception - no character there is just \u201cbad\u201d. Some of them just aren\u2019t \u201cgood\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal surely has a lot of ecchi scenes, but the general bullshit seeping from every scene makes this show completely wank-proof. \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for a fun high school romance, watch Toradora. If you\u2019re looking for a show where a shy MC is sorrounded by ladies with voluptous bodies, watch Sekirei. If you\u2019re looking for a fun ecchi show, watch Shinmai Mao no Testament, Trinity Seven, Absolute Duo or High School of the Dead.\\n\\n\r\nLeave this thing in peace. It doesn\u2019t deserve your time, it doesn\u2019t deserve your money, and it sure as hell doesn\u2019t deserve any legacy.",

I tend to enjoy this kind of show, but hajimete no gal did not deliver very good characters which is a very important aspect in any type of anime really, but especially for this type. The characters are very flat and there interactions with each other is boring. They don't feellike real people as they only have one or two sides of their personality and rely a LOT on their trope e.t.c Tsundere, loli, lolicon, and so on. You only ever experience that side of the characters. \\n\r\nWhat Hajimete no gal had that not all of these ecchi harem school comedy animes have is a decent romance aspect. It was enjoyable to watch but only two characters had any feelings to show, and even that was pretty static but an enjoyable asset to an anime which only ever else offers fanservice.\\n\r\nIn the end it lacked something to stand out compared to ecchi animes and this had nothing but the slight amount of romance that was not enough to save it. They tried to go with a gal kinda trope to stand out but turned out to be nothing more than extra fanservice.",

            "content": "Let's be honest here, we all came to watch this show for the same reason...\r\nBut to be COMPLETELY honest there was a positive surprise for me after the show started running properly. Hajimete no Gal is a harem-anime, but this harem is not in the standard \"Every girl is completely in love with the MC just because\"-category. It's enjoyable thanks to the main characters, Junichi and Yame and the progression in their relationship, which actually does differ from the mainstream harems quite a bit.\r\nStory: 8 - For a show with not much premise and which only relies on the relationships between certain characters the showsurprises with its funny and sweet moments. Don't expect TOO much though.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6 - The art is not bad, but it's not that good. +The \"jiggliness\" of certain bodyparts is quite distracting even during moments when they are not needed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6 - Again, the sound is not bad, the music is lacking and the characters sound exactly like you would expect them to, but the characters have good parts and the different versions of the MC inside his head are pure gold in a comedic aspect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8 - The whole story's point and the clear winner of the show. Read below for my detailed opinion on the character development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 - I didn't expect to enjoy this show much more than in uh... scientific research purposes only, but I'm actually enjoying the show and I want to see how the characters end up. I want to see a happy ending with these characters (Not you pedophile friend Number 3, rot in a cell and burn in hell).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 - It's a fun show with ecchi for those who are searching for it, but also some normal RomCom aspects that make you invested in atleast a few good characters. I hope to see more of this progress in the future.\\n\\n\r\nSo a detailed opinion on the show:\\n\r\nThe most positive thing I can give for this anime is its way of advancing characters, or atleast the 3 main characters. When the anime starts you'll just think that the Yame and her best friend are just some random sluts that'll mess around with the MC, but as the story moves forward you'll start to see that they're completely different. Yame just wants a cute relationship with a nice guy and sees Junichi as a genuinely nice guy, who sees her for who she really is and her best friend messes with the MC and even hates him because she's trying to protect Yame. \\n\r\nIn short, This anime went from a complete Ecchi-fest to a somewhat sweet story between Yame and Junichi. Now whether or not you're looking for a cute romance is not my problem, there are still those basic pervy scenes with the girls that you can enjoy. I just feel like there might be hope for this anime storywise thanks to the character progression.\\n\\n\r\nI would otherwise rate this anime's characters 9/10 if it wasn't for some FUCKING disgusting parts. For example, there is a literal fucking pedophile in the show. The MC's 3rd friend, a fat fuck, who is only after girls 12 or younger and who LITERALLY says to a girl from preschool \"The only way that I could express my feelings to you would be illegal\". The disgusting piece of shit is meant as a joke and it barely rolled on the first time around. It has really gotten to the point where I should call the police for whoever even came up with him. The MC's friends switch from funny to obnoxious from time to time, but thankfully they serve more as a comic relief and somewhat help with the story.",

            "content": "The reason I wanted to watch Hajimite no Gal was for pure fanservice, and because it was an Ecchi Harem, I immediately clicked the watch link. Little did I know that that's not what I would get, instead, I got one of the cutest romances of the year! (If not the cutest!)\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nA normal looking guy confesses to a girl and she accepts his confession, the cliche level was strong with that one. But what's to applaud is what's *beyond* that confession. Thankfully, this was a relationship anime and not a 'realising my feelings through the season's anime (IYKWIM). The way Hajimite no Gal introducesand presents it's romance is so realistic that In shocked there's no live adaptation yet. Really realistic scenarios (mostly...) and a cute romance is something I'm all for and that's exactly what I got with Hajimite no Gal. Sure, I came for the Ecchi but got a lot of romance in return (and as it's my fav genre I wasn't complaining). Simply put, a unique story about a normal person dating a hot chick but with a whole lot of realism involved. An 8 for sure\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful. 'Nuff said. I fell in love with the way the colors are presented with both the background and the characters. Junichi looks more ordinary as ever (if that could ever happen) and I love the way how the color pink is used especially for Yame-san. Her strawberry blonde hair looks better than most other anime girls with the same hair.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe VAs did a really good job. The characters match their personalities a lot and I'm not just talking about the main characters. The supporting Characters (especially Junichi's friends) sound amazingly accurate to their personas and I loved it. The OP was quite memorable altthough the ending was something I loathed later on and forgot really easily...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThey knocked it out of the park with this one. Seeing an Ecchi anime with good character development is something that happens once in 4 or 5 years or so. The way the characters developed their personalities is not just amazing but unbelievable especially considering it's genres.\\n\\n\r\nJunichi: Our resident Virgin, He confesses to Yame in the first episode and shockingly gets his confession accepted. Most anime would end there but seeing how the anime *starts* off with that, they got more to do. Junichi starts to develop genuine feelings for her and thankfully *not* because of her body, (a major selling point from an Ecchi anime, a genre where boobs = feelings developed). He realises his true feelings and genuinely wants to make Yame happy.\\n\\n\r\nYame: Thank God Yame wasn't a robot with a heavy chest. Most Ecchi anime abuse chest size (even this anime is no exception, featuring a character who's chest is so big it can't fit on a table and is used *as a cushion*) anyways back to Yame. She too has very sensible reasons to like Junichi (I won't spoil it) and in a meduim where girls are branded as 'Deres' Yame escapes that stereotype as she like us humans have multiple feelings within us and are very complex people. The same goes for Yame. And I don't know about you, but that how I saw her character. One of a person who wants others to feel happy, while also wanting their own happiness and depending on other people while also trying to be independent. Multiple feelings right there. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Hajimite no Gal. Not because I write the exact same phrase here in every other of my reviews but because I genuinely enjoyed it to the fullest. It had a super cute Romance, a super cute relationship, a super cute art style and so on. Everything about the anime was cute, and I really loved that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEven though after my calculations I should've rated this a 9, I refrained because even though I enjoyed the anime, there were still a lot of times when I felt that \"This could've happened\" or \"why did this happen\" and \"why did she suddenly feel like that\" and so I had to tone it down. And so I felt Hajimite no Gal is an 8 out of 10 at best. Adorable, funny and soft at heart, Hajimite no Gal is an anime you'll love whether you're married, dating someone or are just a virgin like me (*Cries*). One of the best Romances of 2017!\\n\\n\r\nP.S: It's quite obvious but I'll still make it clear. Yame is best girl <3 and not just because she's beautiful, because she cares for everyone ;)",

            "content": "It\u2019s not very often we get an anime where the main character already has a girlfriend or gets a girlfriend in the first episode and Hajimete no Gal was marketed as the latter. Having never heard of it before, it gave me high hopes for its potential. I had hoped that it would explore some themes that are rarely explored having skipped the hurdle that most anime reserve for its climax and its niche of focusing on gyaru could have led to some interesting conflicts. The gyaru theme explored is essentially \u201cYou thought gyaru are just easy sluts! Well, they\u2019re actually not!\u201d Needless to say,my hopes were dashed.\\n\\n\r\nLike most stories, Hajimete no Gal\u2019s story occurs through story arcs. It\u2019s just unfortunate that most of these story arcs boil down to \u201cOh no, something bad is going to happen to the girl(s). Well, time for the protagonist, Junichi, to temporarily man up and do something.\u201d While the arcs do allow some of the characters to shine-- which result in some of the better moments in the anime\u2014a lot of the conflicts could have been solved or prevented altogether if people would have just sat down and talked it out. This is especially true for the final arc of the anime and also why it was so frustrating to see it play out.  Not only that but even when the good parts are happening, the shot direction can take a turn for the worst like when there is panning upskirt shot of a female character during a tense scene in a caf\u00e9 near the end of the anime as if to say \u201cWe know it\u2019s not that great of a story so here\u2019s some unnecessary eye candy.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nThe story is also filled with blatant clich\u00e9s. For example, despite Junichi clearly be in a relationship with one girl and one girl only, he still manages to develop this pseudo-harem of girls who all want him for one reason or another and he somehow only realizes the girl wants him when the girl in question blatantly tells him. Or \u201cHey it\u2019s the king\u2019s game, let\u2019s conspire to have the girls kiss us!\u201d Or \u201cHey it\u2019s the hot springs, let\u2019s go peek on the girls while they\u2019re naked because we\u2019re not \u2018real men\u2019 if we don\u2019t.\u201d Or \u201cHey, that person\u2019s more attractive than me in basically every way, it sure would be a shame if I had pre-existing self-confidence issues and went into a state of depression which lead to conflict.\u201d The anime doesn\u2019t strive to do anything different and, at the same time, anything it does attempt to do story-wise isn\u2019t executed particularly well.\\n\\n\r\nFor most romcoms, characters are the defining aspect which will most likely make or break the show. Hajimete no Gal\u2019s characters definitely break the show for me. Barely any of the characters have any clear motivation so you don\u2019t really know what makes them tick and the majority of the characters are one-dimensional. Most notorious of these is Junichi\u2019s lolicon friend and the show\u2019s constant reminder to you \u201cOh yeah, did you know he\u2019s a lolicon?\u201d If you were to stop watching each episode the moment the anime reminded you that Junichi\u2019s friend is, in fact, a lolicon, you would probably never be able to watch a single episode in its entirety, it\u2019s really that bad. Junichi\u2019s other two friends are the blue-haired guy with glasses who is a super otaku who is also the mastermind of the group and the blonde guy who I think is an avid gamer. All four of the males are perverted and they definitely give off a Prison School vibe. It\u2019s just that Hajimete no Gal\u2019s male group is the stale, knock-off, store-brand-cereal-tossed-in-the-clearance-bin version of the group from Prison School. You can tell by the lack of names of these characters in describing them how memorable they were to me. None of Junichi\u2019s friends are really developed in any way and despite being the main protagonist, Junichi\u2019s own development seems stunted and/or extremely slow because it doesn\u2019t seem like he changes much through the course of the anime\u2019s ten episodes, if at all. By the end of the anime\u2019s tenth episode, Junichi doesn\u2019t seem to accomplish much other than manage to keep his girlfriend and maybe gain a little confidence. Other than that, Junichi is essentially just used as the conduit for most of the fanservice in the show, whether it\u2019s through his random fantasizing or simply existing around the four main girls.\\n\\n\r\nOn the flip side, the four main girls of the anime are Yame, Ranko, Kashii, and the childhood friend in major need of breast reduction surgery who also calls Junichi \u201cOnii-chan\u201d. Of the entire cast, Ranko and Kashii are definitely my favorites and are coincidentally also the most developed characters in the entire show but I\u2019ll first address the final and the first of the four girls, in that order. The childhood friend in major need of breast reduction surgery who also calls Junichi \u201cOnii-chan\u201d is essentially how I would describe that character to someone who\u2019s never seen the show and it\u2019s also her character in a nutshell. But, there\u2019s an extra layer of being an emotional support imouto who wants to be seen as a woman by Junichi and also have sex with him and marry him because childhood friends of the opposite sex need to make marriage promises when they\u2019re young but only one of them remembers that promise being made in the first place. In the beginning, she had a fairly annoying running gag that involved her literally running but that stopped after she developed more as a character and began intruding on Yame and Ranko when Junichi was around. Despite being the \u201cmain\u201d heroine, Yame seems strangely underdeveloped. We know she\u2019s an overall nice person who is often adverse to lewd things despite the stereotypes surrounding gyaru and is in love with Junichi but, perhaps due to the story revolving around Junichi\u2019s point of view, she\u2019s consistently somewhat of an enigma. While her actions obviously follow a clear line of logic that makes complete sense to her, the audience is often just completely oblivious to what\u2019s happening in her mind so her actions can seem somewhat random or confusing to the audience-surrogate Junichi, which is a main component of the conflict in the final arc. Ranko, on the other hand, seems surprisingly more developed than the main girl Yame. She actually has some character motivation, however simple, and she definitely steals the spotlight at times. She also gets some random meta love at times like when Ranko was dressed up as Miki Sayaka from Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica in the cosplay caf\u00e9 was an interesting nod as her Japanese voice actress, Kitamura Eri, also voiced Sayaka, though this may have just been completely coincidental. Weirdly enough, the character with the most development is Kashii, who ends up going through her own character arc that ends up spanning most of the anime and even ends up solving a conflict on her own while Junichi is busy yelling about how morally inferior someone else is.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as sound design goes, the sound effects are the typical stock affair you can find pretty much anywhere and the music is forgettable. While the voice actors seem to do their best with what they\u2019re given, they\u2019re rarely given anything that allows them to work their magic. Overall, the sound design in the anime is average at best but there are still points where it misses its mark.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are definitely where the anime falls on its face the most. The animation consistently feels lazy or incompetent and I often found myself surprised when there were legitimately good sections of animation, however rare they were. There are often times where the characters themselves look off-model with their body parts being over or under-sized and, on top of that, looking poorly drawn. The eyes, in particular, will often be lopsided on characters\u2019 faces and tend to have an overall lifeless look to them for most characters, which seems to be particularly true for Yame.\\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal is an anime a few good parts but its many flaws simply hold it back from being average and, even for a \u201cguilty pleasure\u201d anime, it falls short of almost all others in its category. It manages hits that sweet point where it\u2019s essentially unrecommendable; it\u2019s definitely not good but, at the same time, it doesn\u2019t quite reach the point of \u201cso bad it\u2019s good\u201d infamy.\\n\\n\r\n3 out of 10",

            "content": "Now before I start this review, I must say that this is my first review, and I'm currently reading the manga to this, and that I enjoy it quite a bit. Now this adaption on the other hand is a disaster. Now I HIGHLY recommend reading the manga to this instead of watching the anime, this adaption doesn't give the full idea or feelings that the manga gives and is far from enjoyable. This also happens to be the first manga that I've read before an adaption was released.\r\nWhere to even start with this? The plot and timeline in the adaption is horrendous. Every plotscene and small moments that made the manga enjoyable was either skipped, replaced with a lousy filler, or COMPLETELY rushed just so they could get to the beach episode and finish the anime with fillers.\\n\\n\r\nThe timeline too is completely flipped around as scenes that happened around chapter 30 in the manga, were shown well before scenes from the early teens in the manga. The producers gave no extra thought to the effort Ueno put and just disregarded the plot and changed what they wanted in order to provide either more fanservice or just half-assed plot. Now I don't mind fillers or fanservice, but not when they interrupt and completely change every single thing that happened in the manga. The scenes that they did keep, were rushed to point where they showed it for less than a minute, then went straight back into fillers.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, who in the right mind thought that when making each episode that adding as much jokes about pedophiles as they could would be funny and good idea?\\n\\n\\n\r\n*SPOILERS BELOW*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow the points that made me really upset. Why did they feel the need to completely flip the good plot scenes around? During the earlier episodes when Kashii appeared and became a problem for Yame and Hashiba, they didn't go to a cafe to have fanservice thoughts of doing it. No, they went to a mall so he could buy a cute present for Yame but did they show that? No, they only wanted as much emphasis on the sexual interactions between the two. I doubt that they'll even show that wonderful scene we saw in the manga recently with the key chains, why? Because they went and thought that making Hashiba jealous in the final episodes instead of Yame would make for a better end to the anime when it ends next week.",

There was generous helpings of panty and boob shots and some of the scenes were quite lewd but nothing unsavoury. However most of all this anime was a light hearted comedy.\r\nThe plot revolves around a clueless young man who, almost by accident, starts dating a girl out of his league and ends up getting his first taste of teenage romance. Including the highs, lows and general confusion that comes along with it. I feel youprobably mispent or are misspending your teenage years if you can't draw any connection to the characters. \\n\\n\r\nI would reccomend this to people who were not robots during their formative years and don't think anime should exclusively be lolis patting each other or musclely dudes beating eachother to a pulp whilst explaining every action they perform in excruciating detail. :)\\n",

            "content": "\u201cNobody dies a virgin...life fucks us all.\u201d\r\n-Kurt Cobain\r\nWe've all been there. Aimlessly meandering through our high school lives daydreaming about that fateful day we\u2019ll finally lose our virginity. Thoughts of the opposite sex constantly flood our brains, in the form of unrealistic scenarios involving our crushes intoxicatingly succumbing to our supreme hotness. Naturally, high school is a perverted cesspool of teenage hormones, so more than likely you had your own clan of other clodhopping comrades to share phrases like \u201cdude...tits\u201d and \u201chave you seen that chick\u2019s online stream?\u201d For some introverted, socially inept souls, whose virginity is as safe as a maximum security prison thereare anime like Hajimete no Gal. A show that constantly reminds us how often the average male teenager thinks about sex, mostly in a sporadic and succinct manner. Unfortunately, after viewing all ten of its episodes, I can say I now know more than I ever cared to about the \u201caverage\u201d Japanese teenager, ad nauseum. Join me as I explore how not to make an ecchi anime, in honest and excruciating detail. \\n\\n\r\nTo get something off the board immediately, Hajimete no Gal is not a traditional harem anime. A harem, by definition implies that the women \u201cshare\u201d one male, which is the opposite of what happens in this show. Here's what transpires in a nutshell:\\n\\n\r\n1. Awkward, unassuming dude Junichi starts dating popular girl Yukane out of peer pressure to lose his virginity.\\n\r\n2. Multiple chicks adversarial of their blossoming relationship come out of the woodwork in attempts to thwart their bond.\\n\r\n3. Junichi realizes there\u2019s more to relationships than sex (SPOILER ALERT)\\n\r\n4. Junichi\u2019s friend is an overt pedophile that deserves to be locked away for the rest of eternity.\\n\\n\r\nThat's pretty much it. Hajimete gets off to a hobbling start in the way of story. If you came into a ten episode anime labeled in the ecchi genre, you're probably an idiot for fathoming anything other than repetitive, lecherous humor or a plethora of oppai characters. As the anime begins to unfold, the season of love has arrived. Spring, as I'm seeing in Japan apparently causes the entire student populace to transform into a bunch of blithering horndogs. Couples are formed left and right, so our main protagonist and his friends are desperate to find ANY girl willing to approach them without a ten foot pole. Doesn't sound like the most enticing setup for an anime if you ask me. What follows could be a decent series between two characters forging their love, but instead implodes on itself due to some dreadfully written characters and haphazard perversion played off as comedy. \\n\\n\r\nOne big point to speak to in Hajimete no Gal is the writing. The comedic elements are very hit and miss. I'll be honest, there was more than one scene in the anime I busted up laughing. Whether it's the far fetched \u201cwhat-if\u201d illusions Junichi encountered or a dude showing up in a Kirito costume in an effort to impress girls, all did not fall flat. But plenty of it did, and the fact that Studio NAZ tried to pass off a pedophilic character as funny is a disgrace to entertainment enthusiasts everywhere. Hey, at least his friends didn't condone his behavior\u2026 Also, there's this:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cAll I want is a dope pussy to fuck.\u201d\\n\r\nYes, this is a real line from the show.\\n\\n\r\nI can't imagine the budget was very large for this anime, considering there were still-animated screenshots with singing or music in the background on more than one occasion. To me, it came across as a lack of effort on the studio\u2019s behalf. In addition, there were plenty of failed censorships (for an ecchi), and useless scenes thrown into the mix. And yes, before you ask\u2026 there is an obligatory summer episode. Tits galore! The series attempts to find a common ground between the plethora of \u201cnothing ever happens\u201d high school romance anime (Ao Haru Ride) and the quicker escalating lewd shows like Prison School or High School DXD. Unfortunately it's poorly visioned, so a majority of the time is devoted to introducing characters, rather than developing the existing ones. Even a few more episodes would've done the writing staff some favor.\\n\\n\r\nThough exhaustingly bland overall, I have to give Hajimete some credit with how it handles the main character\u2019s relationship with Yukane. What starts off as a dare from his friends, actually turns into something of substance. It's everyone else in the show that I can't stand. At first, Yukane appears to be a tsundere, a trope vital to the framework of any harem anime. However, as things progressed, I actually began to somewhat respect her and the way she handled Junichi, knowing his original intentions for their relationship. It ended up being the only speck of quality in a sea of genericism. From what I understand, the studio ended up leaving out many of the manga scenes involving their development, most likely to better craft a \u201ccash grabbing\u201d series vice one of any legitimacy. It's a shame considering how much better the anime probably could've been.\\n\\n\r\nNene, the only girl that presumably had feelings for Junichi from the anime\u2019s inception, possesses almost every quality I hate in a character. An incessantly ear-piercing voice, a loli physique (minus her enormous breasts) and the fact that she just gets in the way in every scene she accompanies. Along with the iriitating Nene, tanned dominatrix Ranko fills the quota of yandere, while Yui fills that of a tsundere. And of course, they all have their reasons for trying to steal Junichi away from his new girlfriend, come hell or high water. Junichi\u2019s unintentionally abstinent posse consists of a guy with glasses who constantly shouts bombastic phrases, a pedophile who\u2019s drawn a map of every elementary schooler\u2019s location in his neighborhood (literally, wtf?!) and another seemingly average blonde haired dude that does little to nothing in the entire anime. Honestly, these characters only existed to interject punchlines, waiting in the wings for their chance to drop a pointed one-liner. None of the other side characters seemed to matter at all, as they were plot devices if anything.\\n\\n\r\nFor the life of me I can't understand why any animator needs to draw breasts as big as the characters have here. This is especially disconcerting when they appear on a girl who resembles a 12-year-old. Like, we all know the 4 foot 9 chick with size HHH tits amirite? This isn\u2019t hentai guys, let's at least try to invoke some realism here. Many of you would be quick to respond with, \"well it IS anime\u2026\u201d. This is where I would beg to differ. To me, characters that are drawn closer to a realistic scale are much sexier in anime. If I wanted to look at someone with elephantitis, I'd watch TLC or go to the weird part of Youtube. Who even likes this shit? The rest of the animation, while subpar, isn't anything I'd say was detracting from the show\u2026 unless that is you count the karaoke scenes the animators were too unskilled or lazy to even draw. Or also the inconsistent character model drawings, most specifically in the mall scene when the girls are trying on clothes. Okay, so maybe the animation sucks too. One thing I wasn't sure whether or not was intentional was the censorship. I understand censoring tits or va-jay-jay's, but panty shots too? What gives?! This IS an ecchi right? Show us virgin plebs some goodies!\\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal\u2019s music is exactly what you'd expect from a flashy ecchi show. The OP can't seem to even understand genre of music it is, with cringeworthy dubstep elements thrown in because, ya know it's what the kiddies are listening to nowadays. The ED is a stereotypical scene of a scantily clad Yukane being \u201ccute\u201d... I honestly couldn\u2019t think of any other noteworthy songs in the entire OST, with many droning on like a knockoff DDR track. Cheeky, high pitched vocals with a dose of fast techno bass; the epitome of J-Pop. Voice acting isn't too shabby, and I actually thought Shintara Asanuma\u2019s portrayal of Junichi was above average. Definitely not a soundtrack I\u2019d condone downloading, though it certainly won\u2019t make your ears bleed. \\n\\n\r\nFor as critically bad as it is, I did find some sense of enjoyment in Hajimete no Gal. Through its short run time it did have trouble juggling blatant sex themes with building a believable relationship between the two main characters. At least Junichi learned rather quickly that losing your virginity is not the only important thing out of a relationship. Some people my own age even struggle with that (you know who you are Dave!). I'd recommend this for someone looking for a change of pace, or a good time passer. It's not as hard-core of an ecchi as some anime, but it should scratch the edge of anyone looking for that genre. Until we meet again, thank you for reading!\\n\\n\r\nStory-1\\n\r\nArt-3\\n\r\nSound-4\\n\r\nCharacter-2\\n\r\nEnjoyment-2.5\\n\r\nOverall-2.3",

            "content": "Hajimete no Gal is the perfect representation of the dreck the anime industry tirelessly manufactures: vapid harem twaddle devoid of spirit and interested solely in selling BluRays to wide-eyed otaku who think seeing uncensored anime panties is a wonderful way to spend 5000 yen. The reality is that Hajimete no Gal is worth less than a meal at Matsuya. \r\nThe difference between a harem anime that is well-received versus one that is not is that the popular ones tend to have a certain level of craftsmanship: they look nice-- particularly when focusing on the curvature of the female cast-- and have catchy openings and voiceacting to drive the senses awild. If one was looking simply for some cheaply-produced masturbation fodder, why not, after all, just watch some 'hentai' (as the boys in the west call it) instead?\\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal begs that question repeatedly. \\n\\n\r\nIt is deeply uncertain about whether it wants to be a serious romance or flat-out pornography, and so it attempts to be both. And thus it fails to an almost astounding level. \\n\\n\r\nRepeatedly (often more times in a single episode than can be counted with one hand) the anime will showcase the excessively-censored fantasies of Junichi-- the worthless protagonist-- where Yame and other members of the obligatory harem troupe force themselves on him sexually, begging for sex in the middle of a classroom, a karaoke booth, or some other absurd location that few would ever consider a good idea. Of course this exists because the anime does not have the courage to legitimately have sexual relationships portrayed within the show, and of course it leverages these scenes as an excuse to sell more BluRay copies to sexless otaku who have never walked into an R-18 store before. \\n\\n\r\nThe 'romance' of Hajimete no Gal may well be nonexistent, as Yame and the rest of the female cast never give a single reason for why they are interested in Junichi, much less why they so crave his penis. Yame agrees to go out with him, presumably, because she finds him fun to tease - but then blushes like a 10-year-old at the idea of a kiss. What? I'm sorry, but if you're going to sell an anime on the basis of it having a cast of gal characters - the gal trend being defined by promiscuity - then they should actually be such. If you wish to portray a story with toddlers who think 'indirect kisses' are a thing (and, good lord, this show has that aplenty), then please look to KyoAni's Chuunibyou for inspiration instead of hardcore pornography. \\n\\n\r\nJunichi makes Ichika from Infinite Stratos and Rito from To Love-Ru seem tolerable by comparison. He is a spineless loser whose only goal in life is to lose his virginity (as if anyone in Japan these days actually cares if a high school student hasn't had sex), yet when presented with the opportunity to have sex, cowers like a baby or imposes self-righteousness upon them as if he is now somehow above having sex despite his constant, pathetic attempts at such for the entire series. His friends poke fun at how he might be a cuckold, but in reality, he is the embodiment of one, doing nothing when she sees another man hit on his supposed girlfriend, later throwing a tantrum about how worthless he is and how she deserves that man instead, only to get jealous when he later sees them talk to each other. Whining about how pathetic you are is not an attractive feature, and Yame and crew would do well to leave him aside until he grows up and grows a pair - something unlikely to happen in the event of future seasons. (Let us hope such events never come to pass.)\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is also comprised of cretinous wastes-of-space who do nothing to enhance the quality of the show or make it any less infuriating. You have Nene, the obligatory childhood friend character, massive (and frankly impossibly so) breasts included, who refers to Junichi as \"onii-chan\" and who he of course disregards despite her sex appeal and constant advances because, hey, treating your old friends like trash is a cool thing for anime protagonists to do. Other additions include Yui-- I had to look up her name as I couldn't remember it-- who is conveniently a lewd Nico Nico Douga streamer despite her rich, 'flawless' behavior at school, and Ranko (her name being a pun on the Japanese word for gangbangs...) whose only purpose in the anime is to beat people up, yell at Junichi and attempt to force sex upon him (sometimes both occurring simultaneously). Finally, there is Yame's aforementioned male friend-- a cackling douchebag and dreadful antagonist who behaves in no way resembling an actual human being-- and Junichi's three, pathetic friends who do little else but act jealous towards him and follow him around in the event that one of his harem members might so much as glance in their direction. If the only thing defining these kids and keeping their friendship together is their virginity, then, hey, maybe they were never actually friends in the first place?\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, there are only ten episodes, presumably because they used so many tropes that there are no longer any more cards left to pull from the hat. Onsens scenes, beach scenes where the protagonist lathers lotion onto the girls-- you name it. All the asinine trash the anime industry loves is here for your eyes and ears to feast upon. Hooray. Yahoo.\\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal looks cheap and sounds cheap. None of the fantasy scenes are arousing in any way, nor are the obscured pantyshots the show is so desperately marketing. It has about the same production quality as the average pornographic anime, which makes it a wonder why it couldn't have just been such instead. Even with the decreased characterisation and story a pornographic format would have involved, it would still have been a better anime. At least then it might actually be transparent and honest with itself.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to be quite blunt. Hajimete no Gal sucks. It is not quite abysmal, nor does it win the award for worst harem anime (Infinite Stratos is still a bit more egregious), but it still sucks. Don't watch things that suck.",

            "content": "Watching Hajimete no Gal is like consuming junk food of the worst kind. From the food fast menu, there\u2019s McDonalds, Burger King, KFC, Jack in the Box, Taco Bell, etc. Even among junks, there are sometimes decent ones that can be a guilty pleasure. Unfortunately, Hajimete no Gal is none of that and instead appeals as nothing short than garbage. Without a shadow of a doubt, I can safely say that upon finishing this series, it\u2019s garbage behind comprehension.\r\nFirst, let\u2019s get to the more obvious. The show itself is based on a manga that hasn\u2019t been out too long. (only 2 years in fact) Itmerely has four volumes and yet the producers decided to make this into an anime adaptation. That\u2019s the least of problems though. The real problem begins with the cast of characters. At its core, there\u2019s Junichi Hashibia, a second high school year boy who is an obvious virgin and wants a girlfriend. I can honestly confess that Junichi has some of the worst personalities you can find in anime that\u2019s stitched together into one single entity. The guy has a perverted mind, often clueless about certain situations, and doesn\u2019t seem to excel at anything. He also has some of the most pathetic friends at school and they are no better than him. The only thing that seems to be redeemable about his character is that he is loyal. That actually brings up his involvement with other female characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the cast of girls, we got a variety but the most easily noticeable is Yukana Yame. She\u2019s a gyaru and often attracts the attention of guys and girl alike. Lady luck seems to be on Junichi\u2019s side and Yukana actually decides to be Junichi\u2019s girlfriend. However, their relationship is what I find pretty damn unappealing. Let\u2019s face some facts here because they are nothing really alike. Yukana has school idol-like status while Junichi is a second rate loser. The two have different personalities and doesn\u2019t seem compatible. While the show does give some convincing moments that they can co-exist as a couple, it still doesn\u2019t change the fact that they don\u2019t match. Their character chemistry has very dry humor that often begins from Junichi\u2019s perverted mind or Yukana becoming jealous of other girls. Speaking of the others, the remaining character cast isn\u2019t appealing either. \\n\\n\r\nNene is the typical childhood friend but instead of looking cute and innocent, the show decides to give her enormous boobs and an underage body. Not to mention, she has the personality of a child as she often tries to get Junichi to \u201cravage\u201d her. Yui, the other school idol may seem like an elegant beauty at first. Yet, behind her pretty looks is a girl with a devious personality. Somehow, she believes everyone in the world loves her and she is their master. (well, that is except Junichi) Oh we can\u2019t forget Ranko, the possessive close friend of Yukana. My first impression of her character is that she is an animal. Ranko is very aggressive and wants to protect her territory. In this case, it\u2019s her friend Yukana. Unfortunately, it involves Junichi and the two ends up in some rather compromising positions. So there you have it. Our short yet controversial character cast. Now, if the show actually decided to focus more on characterization, then it would have some chance to salvage itself. Instead, it tries way too hard to appeal to their characters that results in questionable fetishes. I honestly felt uncomfortable watching this show because every episode seems to invite viewers to embrace their atrocious ideas.\\n\\n\r\nThe series\u2019 storytelling is also pretty dreadful. The first few episodes aims at bringing out as much as fetishes as possible. The way it characterizes its female cast makes them look like sex objects. It seems all the guys in the show are perverted in some way or form with their personal desires. Each episode has moments that will show them, sometimes discretely if you pay attention. The overlay of the story seems to focus more on Junichi and Yukana\u2019s relationships development. As I mentioned before, Junichi actually stays pretty loyal to his girlfriend and it\u2019s even more surprising that Yukana is the most mature of the character cast. However, their relationship gets stale real fast. Nothing special really develops between them and instead relies far too much on sexual acts and teasing to do the work. If this show really decided to focus on relationships, at least move outside of Junichi and Yukana\u2019s circle. Instead, the show overemphasizes on their relationship that itself is nothing but generic junk food.\\n\\n\r\nStudio Naz adapts the animation although the visual quality itself is rather mediocre. The male characters look unremarkable with nothing that stands out from their looks. On the other hand, the female cast draws a lot of attention. Yukana is your gyaru girl and probably looks the most convincing compared to the others. The others all look pretty unrealistic. I mean, just look at Nene on that cover. Ranko is somehow allowed to dress like she\u2019s half nude and enter school grounds without trouble. Yui looks normal on the surface but her other appearance looks like some teen idol character. And yes, it\u2019s an ecchi show so expect tons and tons of fan service. The unavoidable beach episode, sexual positions, and lewd character expressions. You name it. It\u2019s there. At many times, it seems the camera is having way too much fun with its angles.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack and music will easily be forgettable as the most noticeable sounds of the show is when girls are moaning, yelling, etc. The OP and ED theme songs contains suggestive camera shots while the character voice mannerism all sound off beat. The only voice I can stand in this show is probably Yukana as she surprisingly sounds the most mature. \\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal is a show that I can\u2019t really recommend to anyone unless you like junk and want to increase your watch-list. I mean, it\u2019s only 10-episodes and it doesn\u2019t take long to finish them all. You can even skip every scene that involves Junichi\u2019s male friends as you wouldn\u2019t miss a second of the plot. The plot itself is devoid of development and instead decides to puts its energy into the fan service. Rather than characterization, it decides to saturate them in the most sexual way possible. Hajimete no Gal is one of the very few shows that I gave a 2/10 this year and looking back, I probably won\u2019t regret giving such a score. Oh but \u201cwhy would you waste your time watching this in the first place, Stark?\u201d Honestly, I wanted to see if this show can ever become better than the manga but unfortunately, that\u2019s a distant memory now. This show is junk food and you can easily toss it into the trash after you\u2019re done.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hajimete no Gal....oh what a mess have they done of this funny romcom....\r\nYou see, I wrote a review for the manga quite a while ago, in which I praised the pace and how the charachters were introduced, unfortunately the producers turned this enjoyable manga in an anime who you are supposed to jack off, but you cant pull it off since it's censored all over...marketing strategy? Most likely...\r\nTrust me when I say the censoring is the last thing that bothers me, like I said at the beginning the pacing is horrible, you dont have time to familiarize with the main characters, girls after girls arethrown in the mix, useless monologue of the main character just to add a little more ecchi in the middle and make the episode long enough, the provocative cutness between our two main characters that is in the manga here doesnt exist, and so on....\\n\\n\r\nThere are too many problems with this anime and, to me at least, is impossible to enjoy as much as I did with the manga.\\n\\n\r\nStory (7):\\n\r\nAs previously stated in my manga review the story is the weakest point since it's the usual \"good for nothing guy date a popular girl\", which is not bad if portrayed well.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8):\\n\r\nIt's quite difficult to make a mess of the art these days with all the technology around, luckly they managed to make at least one thing right.\\n\r\nThe art it's standard, clean, dynamic, colorful, typical of most of harem shows.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6):\\n\r\nAs the opening and the ending are not to my tastes I have to admit that the voice actors do a good job, unfortunately the background sounds are pretty much useless as they hardly ever menage to set the mood for the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5):\\n\r\nOne other thing that I appreciated in the manga was the \"mistery vibe\" that our main heroine Yukane Yame was giving. In fact her gal character and her actions didn't match, that made it really interessting and funny, in the anime however she seems just like any other girls with the sole purpose to make Junichi harem bigger. Even the moments where after confessing they slowly start to grow closer are missing, what a shame...\\n\\n\r\nHashiba Junichi in the other hand is our standard harem character, weak, not particularly good at anything.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (3):\\n\r\nI'm not gonna lie here, even witouth reading the manga I would rate this show avarage at best, it's a huge mess, nothing make sense, minutes of daydreaming of sex of our main character, hardly any development shown in the relationship between the two main characters, in the end it's just a bunch of softcore porn thrown here and there to happeal the younger audience. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (4):\\n\r\nSad I couldn't enjoy the show as much as I'm doing with the manga, if you havent watched too many harem/ecchi show however I'm pretty sure you will at least enjoy it more than me.\\n\\n\r\nHave fun! (if you can lol)\\n",

How ridiculous\u2026 I want to show this to those who would wage war - Three goddesses are pressing their boobs against each other. This has the power to rid the world of all its fighting!\u201d\r\nOh boy!\r\nThe season was Summer 2017, a rather disappointing season altogether, with concepts ranging from exciting new worlds to fucking centaur girls and everything in between, giving even the kinkiest of anime fans something to try. But it seemed like none of them could stand apart from the crowd, rise up and be the season\u2019sbeacon of hope for anime fans. Kakegurui\u2019s crazy faces could only go so far, Fate/Apocrypha is a shell of Fate\u2019s former self and My Hero\u2019s Academia\u2019s \u201cTOURNAMENT ARC\u201d ended last season. However, I am here to change all of that, because there is one show that not only gives us the kind of \u201cplot\u201d that we want, but aims to break modern storytelling conventions to create something special. People will write it off as just cheap otaku pandering, but that in itself is just cheap. This show is a misunderstood masterpiece as it makes anime economically a viable option to invest time and money in to. And how does it go about doing that? The only way the industry knows how: ANIME TIDDIES!!!\\n\\n\r\nOk. Enough with the nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can probably tell, Hajimete no Gal has no shame; it\u2019s a show that managed to stand out from every other anime this season purely because of the amount of lewd fan-service jammed into the show. It is an ecchi high school romance-comedy anime produced by Studio Naz. Nothing in that last sentence sounds promising to me as I have only seen one anime before that belonged to those exact genres that I thought was good, that being the extremely sadistic Prison School. And Studio Naz, despite never having seen a show made from them, are responsible for the notorious DRAMA-tical Murder, need I say more. This anime from the start was pinned by many to be disaster, and while I am of the belief that shows that are predominantly ecchi are not inherently bad, I was not looking at this anime with much in the way of expectations. But I still held hope that it would not turn out as a complete disaster. After all, when one first imagines shoving a hotdog up their ass, I would expect the reaction to be rather negative. I mean, who in their right mind would ever shove a hotdog up their ass? But assuming something is different to experiencing it firsthand. Who knows, maybe one would enjoy the feeling of a hotdog inside their ass?  You can never really know unless you try it, so that\u2019s what I did. But not the hotdog part, I\u2019m still not trying that. I watched all 10 episodes of Hajimete no Gal, and this is what I thought:\\n\\n\r\n*NOTE: This review is purely for the subbed version.*\\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal in short, is trash. This just so happened to be one of those times when assuming a show is terrible before you even start was the best course of action for many anime fans. It follows this generic-looking pervy dude in high school named Junichi who has next to no confidence at all and is a virgin \u2013 this feature being seen in a negative light because in this kind of anime, of course it would. He is portrayed as a pathetic loser who\u2019s saddled with a trio of friends even more pathetic that all lust over women, read porno magazines openly and ultimately keep Junichi from having any real chance at getting laid. But one day, the three stooges force Junichi to confess to the sluttiest girl in school that they know as some sort of prank. Junichi being the weakest character in the entire show goes through with it and somehow\u2026 it worked. The \u201cgal\u201d he confessed to, Yukana Yame, knows that all Junichi is after is sex, yet she decides she wants to go out with him. This is implied that she seems to take pleasure in teasing him and making fun of Junichi\u2019s insecure self, but that maybe there\u2019s more to Junichi that Yukana likes that will be developed as the show continues. With this kind of premise, it is obvious that the show is on the trashy side of anime, but the setup did show promise. The relationship at first looked like it could turn out alright, and the way characters were introduced as common caricatures in a harem anime gave the possibility to break the stereotypes within the sub-genre, leaving us with a show that, whilst trashy, has some substance that\u2019s worth the watch. Unfortunately, the hope was all for nought as it turned out to be another shitty harem series.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the first episode, we are shown every female character that will eventually be a part of the harem: the stereotypical main \u201cgal\u201d Yukana, the big-titted loli Nene and Yui, the Asian prefect (who just so happens to be the only female with a cup size below D). Honestly, their appearances are the only features that matter, because when you take away the T&A, they are all basic bitches that are only there for the sake of the harem and that never changes. Remember that these women all have the feelings for Junichi, the pinnacle of \u2018self-insert male protagonist\u2019 that is so bland that in no way can anyone similar to him get the kind of attention he gets. The only female that makes logical sense to be in his harem is G-cup jail-bait Nene, and that is only because of their childhood friendship. Yukana has no sensible reason for spending so much time with Junichi, especially considering how she first met him after seeing him read a porno magazine with the rest of his doofus friends \u2013 the future child offender included. Yui is only after Junichi because of this weird fetish for controlling men like him, despite how Junichi seems to be the only guy in the entire show that she is ever interested in, paying no attention to any of his fellow virgin friends. Yukana\u2019s friend Ranko is another character prevalent in the show and is the only girl that doesn\u2019t want Junichi\u2019s virginity, but she has as much development as the rest of the cast here \u2013 none. Also, fun fact: Ranko\u2019s character design is a rip off of Mito from Food Wars. The only viewers that I can imagine liking these characters are the ones who screenshot specific clips for \u201clater use\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe male characters are no better, with each character being completely one-dimensional, cringeworthy and an embarrassment to any man with integrity watching this. Junichi\u2019s best pal Shinpei has one purpose in this entire show: to act as Junichi\u2019s wingman. You might be thinking somewhere along the lines of \u2018well that\u2019s pretty shit\u2019, but at least he has a reason to be on screen. The blonde-haired guy of the group, Keigo has no reason to even exist! I had to look up his nam because he was so irrelevant. He has so much hollow characterization that he could have switched spots with Junichi as the generic protagonist and the story would have stayed the exact same. But the worst of them has to be Junichi\u2019s fat ass friend Minoru, who openly admits that he is a paedophile with no shame whatsoever. This guy even says that 15 year old girls are \u201ctoo old for him\u201d \u2026 this is a new low folks. What\u2019s even more cringe is how these little shits seem to nearly always talk about online streams of cam girls when together in school. Hajmete no Gal already shows numerous couples groping each other in public in the first 5 minutes. But when it comes to showing how much of a cesspool the setting is, it goes above and beyond, and that does nothing in the long run. It may be laughable at first, but it only adds to the pile of manure that this show shits out on a regular basis. \\n\\n\r\nSaying that the characters was the only problem is a massive understatement to how far down the toilet this shit sank. The plot is fucking horrendous. It tries to show progression with Junichi\u2019s relationship, but only focuses on random events that happen as the couple gets closer with each other. This type of storytelling makes it difficult to structure plot elements unless there\u2019s good writing behind it, but there is nothing that has been said in this review so far that in any way indicates good writing. Overall, the structure is a mess, riddled with contrivances that destroys most of any chance of development for Junichi and Yukana\u2019s relationship. From the very beginning their chemistry is about as authentic as the lead duo from Fifty Shades of Grey and by the end you are either questioning what was the point of all this, or just gave up on the reasoning and continued watching for the \u2018plot\u2019. The dialogue is also dreadful if you ever take the show seriously. And even then, the script writers probably never gave a shit about trying to make anything quality when you hear lines like this come out of nowhere:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cAll I want is a dope pussy to fuck.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAll I want is some god damn respect shown from staff to viewers that take time out of their day to watch this content. But it\u2019s safe to say that this show has no respect for even telling a competent story, let alone its fanbase. The consensus around most harem anime is when you\u2019ve seen one, you\u2019ve seen most, but this is such a failure that it ends up as a shell of the common harem anime. There are a lot of problems with this show, and it does not help that there was only 5 episodes that actually had storyline progression. Yes, out of the 10 episodes the staff had to tell the entire story, only half of it has anything remotely meaningful. Producing Hajimete no Gal like this made everything feel incredibly rushed, to the point where there is no possible way that anyone watching this had time to get invested in these characters and care about what is happening on-screen. But wait, there\u2019s more, because along with a rushed plot, viewers are subjected to watching full filler episodes dedicated to fan-service; the kind of content you would expect from a show like Fairy Tail. From the compulsory beach episode, to the entire harem getting a job at a cosplay caf\u00e9, they are a waste of animation resources. And after persevering to the end, I have concluded that there is nothing that this adaptation did that could be considered a positive \u2013 it is a terrible adaptation and a terrible anime in general!\\n\\n\r\nNow while it is an awful show with nothing redeemable when it comes to story and characters, the animation and sound is what saves Hajimete no Gal from earning a 1/10. The animation style is usually very common with romance-comedy anime: standard designs with bright, dynamic colours.  There were a few jarring points, like how pink lines used for characters blushing go off the side of their face, and the last episode looking more like it came from Chronexia and the Eight Seals. And while it is overall generic and looks very unremarkable compared to similar anime, technically I found it to be just ok. Maybe I have just become desensitised to anime breasts drawn the size of watermelons but it never bothered me anymore than how sloppy the writing was. However, there is something that I want to get off my chest and that is how there is an uncensored version of Hajimete no Gal that has no reason to exist. I watched the uncensored version, therefore I expected uncensored material, yet all I saw were a couple panty shots that got censored in the \u2018safer\u2019 version. How in the world are you going to censor panty shots in an ecchi show? Even worse, there\u2019s still censorship in the NSFW version. What the fuck!? So even if you were only watching it for a weekly wank, you\u2019d probably have better luck with a handful of other anime from this season. Kakegurui would be a better choice for that reason, even with the \u2018look at me I\u2019m so CRAZZY!!!1!\u2019 expressions. Sound-wise, it\u2019s fine: J-pop opening and ending with basic OST\u2019s, nothing more. Voice-acting was good, with emotions coming through the characters well. Production-wise, it\u2019s fairly competent, and I would be lying if I did not say that I thought some moments were absolutely hilarious. The best scene overall was definitely in episode 6 when one of Junichi\u2019s friends dressed up as Kirito from SAO in an attempt to impress some ladies, comedy gold! Sadly that moment only lasts for 10 seconds, and those kind of moments cannot compensate for how terrible the show was overall and in no way saves this show from damnation. \\n\\n\r\nAnd thus, these are my thoughts of Hajimete no Gal. There is more that I could have stated, but honestly this show is not worth any more time and effort that has already been given. The show is a throwaway anime that lives solely to sell blow-up sex dolls and lewd posters of the female characters to otaku fans that will buy into this garbage every season. It is a piece of trash that continues to wear down the ecchi genre and ultimately makes me ashamed to be a fan of anime in general. My advice: Don\u2019t watch it, and if you do want to watch it, stop, and go back to my original advice. Unless you plan on watching the dub, and even then, only watch if you're in the mood for some trash.\\n",

            "content": "NAZ, a studio I never expected to come back since Hamatora.\r\nI was very surprised to hear that this got an anime, and boy did my perverted side come into light. An anime about a virgin on his journey to step into the region of adulthood.\r\nI feel like ecchi doesn't get the love it deserves. Of course, being an ecchi series, it's understandable. It's been done a lot and might be annoying to some, which I guess makes sense.\r\nThe story is simple. Our MC was forced to confess to a gal, Yukana. Yukana with gigantic titties decides then to tease him and then eventually, Hashiba (ourMC) gets the girl. Congrats?!\\n\\n\r\nWith this a start of a crazy yet amazing relationship begins, as well as some relationships breaking.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the fat pedophile, the other side character friends are quite enjoyable to watch. They support him and Yukana as well as despises him for it. \\n\\n\r\nThis is because they never thought Junichi would be able to pull it off, jealousy from the 2 is inevitable once you get a big, pretty gal like Yukana.\\n\\n\r\nAs dumb and generic it is, I really enjoy the interactions between Yukana and Junichi. It seems like what a nice, cute relationship would look like (of course, minus the fantasies and teasing Junichi has and Yukana does). But I really do like Yukana's character, She's kind hearted and I guess really loves our MC and tries to do what she can to get closer.\\n\\n\r\nHaving read the manga tho, the adaptation was solid, now some parts are either skipped or re-arranged. I really hope it's the latter. Besides that, some characters look different. But I didn't care all too much. But Junichi's childhood friend really needs to see a doctor. I don't understand how she can even walk.\\n\\n\r\nWhatever happens in the future is truly up to the 2 and how they decide to direct their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nIn Conclusion, the anime has its points. The guilty pleasure of Summer, with some nice ecchi. Ecchi haters stay away, and perverts go all the way! This anime is for all perverted needs. But as well as nice character interactions. So enjoy it! Enjoy it for its ecchiness!",

            "content": "Girlfriends, boyfriends, I\u2019m sure most of us have wanted one at some point, or already have one. For those of us who don\u2019t have one, do not fret, Hajimete no Gal is here to indulge you into the experience of having a girlfriend or boyfriend, whether you want it or not. This will not be a painless experience however, so strap yourself in and prepare for the worst, and I mean it.\r\nImagine this: You are just an ordinary guy, and your classmates forced you to ask a hot girl in your class to date you. After she almost turns you down like the loser youare, she instead decides to accept becoming your girlfriend, but is it too good to be true? In most cases, yes, this would be too good to be true, however, in Hajimete no Gal we say \"screw the rules! \"and make the unlikely happen.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the premise may seem enticing at first, the show doesn\u2019t do much to expand on it, leaving you with an empty shell of nothingness for a majority of the show. If you\u2019ve seen at least a couple harem/ecchi anime before, then you\u2019ll probably see the pattern Hajimete follows through its episodes. This doesn\u2019t mean that it has nothing going for it, because it does. Every episode centers on our main character experiencing something new for the first time, whether that is visiting his girlfriend\u2019s house, going to karaoke or even getting a job. Of course, you also have your obligatory beach episode that every harem/ecchi seems to have, but I won\u2019t get into that too much, since I don\u2019t mind it.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is the pacing, it feels really rushed. One moment the characters are doing something random, and in the next scene something dramatic happens without leaving any time to digest what happened. This wouldn't be a problem if the show in question was all about the randomness like Nichijou, but when you add a random element to what seems to be a semi-serious show, at least for me it doesn't work at all.\\n\\n\r\nIf you thought you were going to get some nice uncensored scenes, then think again. I watched the uncensored version, but instead of being presented with uncensored material, they instead decided to censor a guy\u2019s boner through his pants, because that\u2019s totally the best way to make someone interested in your show. The censored version is even worse by the way, they censor stuff like the girl\u2019s panties for no reason, which is a big no-no for me especially when it\u2019s an ecchi show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are for the most part dull and forgettable. The male characters except for the main character don\u2019t really serve a purpose except for being there, which of course entails in almost no character development whatsoever. There\u2019s even a literal pedophile saying that he only wants to fuck little girls, and that 15 year olds are too old for him. There\u2019s not much else to say about them other than that you can literally replace them with clones of Ichika from Infinite Stratos and the experience wouldn\u2019t change that much.\\n\r\nThe females are for the most part attractive, if you ignore their humongous almost Eiken-level boobs and the fact that their personalities are barely there. If you\u2019ve even seen a screenshot from the show, or even the cover, you should know what I\u2019m talking about. They feel unnaturally large, especially for high schoolers, since you are not supposed to have such big boobs when you\u2019re between 16 and 18 years old, but hey, what do I know, right? This is anime we\u2019re talking about, where the impossible can happen at any time because the creator allows for it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it isn\u2019t that bad, but it doesn\u2019t stand out either. There was never a moment where I went \u201cwow, this is totally worth it for the art\u201d instead it was kind of just meh. It serves a purpose, but don\u2019t expect anything fancy, since you\u2019ll be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening was decent enough, and I actually liked the ending theme, it was catchy and felt like a nice end to each episode. Other than that, the rest of the OST was pretty forgettable, mostly just common background music for the sake of having music.\\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal had some okay moments, but the sheer amount of pointless scenes, straight up useless characters and unnecessary censorship pushes my buttons just a little bit too far, and in the end it was a massive disappointment. What could have been an interesting and creative take on the genre instead becomes your run of the mill harem/ecchi show with too many dumb things to explain. If you can, stay away from this show, it is really bad.\\n",

            "content": "To start out, I need to establish that this is a review of the anime's dub. I'll explain why later in the review. Along with that, this will also include spoilers, although I doubt they would really change your viewing experience.  \r\nTo enjoy this show, one must understand it is not meant to be taken seriously. The girls have unconventionally large breasts, and the plot is not the deepest thing in the world, but it's hilarious. I found myself sending quotes from it to my friends just because I was dying from amusement at what they'd say, especially for an American. I amnot knowledgeable about pop culture from other countries, but this dub was filled with pop cultural references and jokes.  \\n\\n\r\n- A Yoda impression \\n\r\n- Mentioning fidget spinners  \\n\r\n- \"The bomb dot com\" \\n\r\n- \"Snaps to chat\" \\n\r\n- \"You wanna know my bra size? 36 Double Deez Nuts\" \\n\r\n- Saying \"Do you wanna build a sand castle\" to the tune of a song from the Disney movie, Frozen \\n\r\n- \"The problem is that you've got a bone where your hot dog should be.\" \\n\r\n- \"Bae stealing b to the itch\" \\n\r\n- \"Shady af\" \\n\r\n- \"#NoFilter #Seriously\" \\n\r\n- \"Great googley moogley, I get to touch her\" \\n\r\n- \"We'll watch your junk anytime.\" \\n\r\n- And many more \\n\\n\r\nThese are unique to the dub. To compare the sub to the dub, in the first episode there are two couples, from whom we can hear the conversations of.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the sub they say: \\n\r\nFemale 1: Let\u2019s go to the amusement park this weekend. \\n\r\nMale 1: Sure. And we\u2019ll spend the night together, right? \\n\r\nFemale 2: There\u2019s an event for couples tomorrow. \\n\r\nMale 2: Guess I\u2019ll have to take you then. \\n\\n\r\nIn the dub, it goes: \\n\r\nFemale 1: Let\u2019s go to the amusement park Saturday morning! \\n\r\nMale 1: Sure, and I\u2019ll show you my log ride Saturday night. \\n\r\nFemale 2: Did you hear it\u2019s couples only night at the movie theater?  \\n\r\nMale 2: You are going to get so felt up.  \\n\\n\r\nOne of these is clearly more entertaining, and that is the English dub.  \\n\\n\r\nI'm an English speaker, I wish I knew Japanese, but I do not. That being said, I can understand more when there is emphasis of English words better than Japanese words. This lead to a better understanding of the story through each of the seiyuu's voices. I can't distinguish between different Japanese dialects, but the Gals in the anime all sounded like the stereotypical 'Valley Girl' as you would call it in America. They said 'like' a lot, their whole tone of voice was spot on and it made the girls sound believable.  \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the girls, the characters were actually a lot of fun to watch. They were not the most original cast, but they worked so well together in my opinion. The girls didn't all just act the same, even though they were all gals. The main girl, she was not a slut, she wanted a proper relationship with him, which was contrary to popular belief. Her best friend was a lesbian, or at least bisexual. MC's childhood friend became a gal so he would notice her. And the girl who was like the class rep. with good grades and stuff, had a princess complex and was a secret gal. That's not all. The friends of the mc, they were the nerdiest virgins ever, which made them believable. They worked at manga cafes, they made the mc confess, one  only likes loli, etc.. If that doesn't convince you then think of how they interact together. It is so easy to image these characters in real life, just hanging out with each other. Their interactions didn't seem forced, (Unless it was the first time they were interacting for the most part.)  \\n\\n\r\nWhile the art is heavily focused on ecchi, it doesn't change the comedic aspects of the show, if anything it makes them better. The mc frequently leers at their breasts, and everybody jokes about it and calls him a virgin. Without the disproportionately large breasts, one of the more basic comedic properties would be gone, and the jokes inside the show would have to cease.  \\n\\n\r\nThe jokes, references, characters and art are all big components of the anime, but there is still the storyline that has gone unmentioned. The show starts off with the mc having to confess to somebody most people see as a slut so that he could finally have sex. But the story is better than that. They go out and have fun, the anime isn't just a bunch of sex, there is actually no sex in it, no matter how much he wants it. The other girls try to initiate sexual interaction throughout the show, but the mc is better than that, he starts liking his girlfriend more, to the point that he doesn't just want to have sex with any girl, he wants her. He loves her. The highest point in the series is when they kiss for the first time. Even though this was a comedic series, and the mc was super perverted, I couldn't help but root for him and hope that he would get a happy ending with her.  \\n\\n\r\nThe bottom line, is that this is a fantastic show, if you love comedy, slightly perverted jokes, ecchi, or a slice of life series that isn't super innocent.  \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I can not stress enough how important is is to watch the dub.",

Personally, I think it's because it's a funnier and an easier genre to appreciate, as being a reliable and a fun combination. And there's nothing wrong with the liking of some ecchi series, including Hajimete no Gal and by that, I'm another one that thinks that ecchi doesn't get the love it deserves.\r\nThis story for Hajimete no Gal, as for some others series by the same genre, appears to be simple. Our main protagonist (named Junichi) is forced by his friends to confessto a gal named Yukana and then, by surprising, he gets the girl in exchange for some conditions. So Junichi is our male protagonist and he wants to try getting a girlfriend to help him with his insecurity. The girl, Yukana, on the contrary, it's a more interesting character, because she likes to tease him and seems very confident when she's doing it giving an idea or her life's experience.\\n\\n\r\nI think this is what people want when they are searching for a funny romance story with a bit of fanservice and with a perfect pacing for 10 episodes. It also has a great opening and ending song, which combines with the series as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nApparently, this is one of the best adaptations in this season also including the adaptation of the Kakegurui manga. This adaptation even has some parts that are skipped or re-arranged from the original manga but doesn't seem to be a problem.

            "content": "This. Is. Trash. Personally, I'm not a big fan of calling anime trash because I know that even if I don't personally like it there are likely others who do like it, and that enjoyment of it provides enough benefits to those watchers that at the very least they have a purpose. But this anime is the truest definition of trash. Not only is it devoid of anything that could be considered quality but it is massively insulting to its subject matter, to its viewers, and to anyone that could have the grave misfortune of watching this anime.\r\nWhere does it go wrong? A better questionwould be where does it go right. Just one look at it and you can likely already tell a big problem. Lots of big exposed breasts, an ecchi tag. This would lead one to think its a show that doesn't even try to be good, that uses fanservice and oversized breasts to sell copies. A show without any artistic integrity. And all of that is true. But that oversells it. There are many shameless ecchi series that have no thought put into their plot or story and try to get by fanservice. And certainly most of them aren't good, but there are two key differences. One, that even amongst those shows Hajimete no Gal is significantly lacking in quality. Two, those anime aren't insulting unlike Hajimete no Gal.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you look at the main character and his friends it's hard not to see this show as insulting to its primary demographic. The main character's bros are all a bunch of creeps who's ideas about girls are problematic. It's clear from the very first episode that they seem them as nothing more than as sex objects. The first episode has them talking about women's breasts as if that's all that matters. (To them a girl without breasts has no value and isn't worth their attention.) Even when getting close to some girls, or at least having the option to, they still seem more interested in seeing them naked, making them kiss each other, or just watching them in bikinis, more than they do interacting with them. It's as if they solely exist just for their amusement. It's disgusting. And let's not forget about the oversized acorn whose sole purpose in the show is to talk about how much he likes elementary school aged girls, and wants to love them. Yup, you heard me right. And he does nothing else but that. I'm not sure what the point of his character is because it's not funny! He even gets a job at a day care. Why do they let this happen? And while the MC is not like that himself, he still hangs around these guys. He excuses their behaviour even though it's the type of garbage that should be disavowed. Besides he's not really that different himself. He frequently thinks of his own girlfriend in ways that can get him laid or get him to see her panties. He only decides to drag out his \"confession\" to her so he can catch more glances of her panties. He may be better but he's still pretty much scum.\\n\\n\r\nYou may look at these characters and wonder why they're so insulting. They're just characters, right? Well, think about how harems work. They operate on the idea of a self-insert protagonist. You're supposed to be inserting yourself into this loser. The audience is supposed to be able to relate to these people. Furthermore, this is the anime's interpretation of otaku. As men deluded with the outside world that are unable to see it as anything more than fuel for their boners. How is that not insulting? Not to mention, completely wrong. \\n\\n\r\nI shouldn't need to explain how this show is insulting to women. Between the male characters opinions and attitudes on them and the typical fanservice it should be pretty obvious. I'm not one to think that fanservice is inherently insulting to women but in a show like this, it is. When the main role of them seems to be them being slobbered over it's hard not to find it insulting. Especially when every male character in the series is playing 3D chess to try to get them to do something lewd or to see their naked body. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then the obvious, it's insulting to the viewer because it doesn't give a damn about quality. Now this maybe true of other shows. But when you combine it with how insulting it is it all builds up to be an insulting superpower. Hajimete no Gal isn't conserned with being good. It isn't even conserned with being nice. It's selling sleazeballs and fanservice and hoping that it'll work out well enough. They don't even follow the manga well and instead replace it with this drivel. Is there no stop to their insult brigade?\\n\\n\r\nYou may get it now that it's insulting, but how about that quality? \\n\\n\r\nWell it's terrible. The characters are boring and under developed. Only the main Gal girl has enough going for her to make her interesting and even with that, she isn't. Most of the plot is the type of stuff that is found in most generic harems. I don't need to go into it because if you have watched any other generic harem you'll already know what this'll be like. And if you haven't then I suggest you watch those other more popular harems instead because they play them so much better. Situations arise just to give the MC more girls in his harem, as well as to push as much fanservice as possible. What makes Hajimete no Gal special is that the harem comedy scenes feel so much more unrealistic than normal. It all feels like a set up to terrible jokes (that have been done a thousand times before no less) and fanservice. None of it feels natural or feels like the natural reaction of the characters. At least most harems are able to get that part right and feel real even if they are trashy. \\n\\n\r\nFor some reason Hajimete no Gal also tries to do a more serious romance arc which not only clashes against its lighthearted comedy base but is also completely mangled and poorly done. The reactions of the characters are overblown for the sake of driving the narrative and it's hard to believe that everything so conveniently fits into the storyline they want. It's bad writing 101. They even add in an obviously bad baddie because screw nuance. \\n\\n\r\nAnd for a fanservice anime, it doesn't look pretty at all. At least if the animation and art were nice there would be a point to watch this but it all looks pretty ugly, and if you watch with the censors it takes it up to nauseating. For a show that relies on fanservice the art needs to be good or else what is the point of that. Apparently Hajimete no Gal missed the memo on that because it didn't even try.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's basically what it is, an insulting stupid generic harem comedy that has no idea how to write any part of itself well. Please for your own sanity don't watch it. I'm sure that there is something much better for whatever reason that you would want to watch this show. Please watch that instead and leave this to die. The less that watch this drivel, the better.",

            "content": "Overall i'd give this anime a 7 which for me means it was simply an Enjoyable ride. Many of the Harsh reviews are from people that came into this anime with huge misconceptions that'd it'd be extremely \"Ecchi\" maybe some nudity etc and or the majority that have only seen the obnoxious \"Censored\" version\" which takes away from a shows overall quality. That being said i watched the unscensored version and this anime is far from being very ecchi and maybe only has 1-2 episodes with anything more than a standard \"panty shot\". This anime has 0 real nudity so don't expect that and tbhtheres no reason for it to even be censored in the first place. Saenai Heroine was probably 2-3x as much ecchi/fanservice as this show to be entirely honest and that show has 0 censoring. I feel as though many people expected this to have Highschool DxD levels of fanservice etc and were rather let down by that bc at the end of the day this anime is purely an awkward love story of young teenagers trying to understand what it takes to make a relationship work. \\n\r\n-In conclusion if you're looking for Highschool DxD lvls of fanservice and ecchi this anime is not for you.\\n\r\n-If you don't like love stories and light melodrama in an episode or 2 then this anime is not for you.\\n\r\n-If you're okay with taking a fun light hearted/slight ecchi/feelgood anime for what it is and not expecting some profound levels of backstory then this if for you.\\n\r\n-If you like a funny supporting cast that at times comes off as quite odd then this is for you.\\n\r\n-If you sympathize with any type of first love stories this is for you.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion this anime is \"Good\" but its far from great and tbh the Manga did it a lot better. Overall 10 episodes should have been 12 so they wouldn't cut corners from the Manga but it still remains a decent adaptation. As i said take this anime for what it is and you'll love it but put it under a critics microscope and nitpick every little thing and you probably won't. 7/10\\n",

            "content": "I\u2019m quite picky when it comes to anime I watch, but I can forgive plenty of short comings : I can forgive plot-holes, underdeveloped characters, minor animation issues, cliches and archetypes (to a degree)... It obviously depends on the nature of the show - for a story-heavy show, which puts proper delivery, tempo and relationships between the characters at the top, lack of development of the characters themselves can be devastating. \r\nI also seldom give extreme ratings when I\u2019m asked to grade a show, a video game or any other piece of media, because it takes a particular effort to make something absolutely unbelieveable,be it a masterpiece or a complete trainwreck. In many cases, a show is bad, but it\u2019s not the end of the world, and in the end, it\u2019s likely I\u2019ll forget about it\u2019s existence soon after I finish watching it. Same with good shows - there are a ton of genuinely good, fun anime out there, many of which can\u2019t compete with the absolute top contenders cause they just don\u2019t quite have that special something - maybe it\u2019s the visuals that are just a bit short of greatness, might be that the story is not as interesting or the execution in general falls short. \\n\\n\r\nThere also hasn\u2019t yet been a show that I genuinely hated as a whole entity. I despised parts of it (like the main protagonist in High School DxD - a comparison that will be repeated in this review) but I've never despised a show so deeply that I utterly refused to find something that didn\u2019t suck about it.\\n\\n\r\nUntil now.\\n\\n\r\nI dislike SAO. I dislike The Asterisk War. I dislike all the generic action/harem shows flooding the Light Novel and anime markets lately. I dislike the cheaply made ecchi shows, selling themselves on absolutely nothing but said ecchi content. \\n\\n\r\nBut Hajimete no Gal is a unique specimen. This is one of a kind, and it\u2019ll most likely remain that way until the end of time.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a cataclysm of such epic proportions that putting it in mere words is a truly Herculean task, one that makes me almost humbled by how tiny I am in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nHave you ever seen a piece of media with absolutely zero value? No entertainment, no lessons to be learned, no new skill to aquire, just plain nothing. An empty hole, with no creativity, interesting ideas, new concepts and no utter lack of effort in putting it all together, in making it even slightly cohesive.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not speaking about something that you\u2019d call \u201cbad\u201d or even \u201chorrible\u201d. I\u2019m taking about something PARTICULARILY vile. A show that made you remember all the 1/10 stuff you\u2019ve experienced and literally caused you to look at it with far more favourable eye, purely because they weren\u2019t \u201cthat\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal is such show for me. This little gem combines every single thing I despise with blind, overwhelming fury and skillfully blends it into a shit-shake the likes of which I never expected possible to create. It looks like shit. It sounds like shit. It\u2019s content is nothing but a shitflood after a shitflood, and the worst thing is, this will not be the last one of it\u2019s kind. \\n\\n\r\nEnter Junichi Hashiba. Junichi is a high school boy who really, really wants to have a girlfriend. He also has a group of friends, who also wish they had girlfriends. So one day, they decide to play a prank on the innocent little Junichi and pair him up with a gal (or \u201cgyaru\u201d, since we need a proper cultural term for it to matter in this case) by putting a letter in her locket, asking her to meet Junichi behind school.. Their plan to seemingly screw their friend over fails however, as the lass actually agrees to date Junichi. If this description sounds bland and uninteresting, it\u2019s because that\u2019s what it is. And once you actually see it in motion, it gets even worse. And then it continues to accelerate downhill at an alarming pace.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with Junichi himself. I\u2019m deeply convinced that current LN market has some sort of a vendetta against young schoolboys, since they seem to be trying to make them as utterly repulsive and unlikeable as they possibly can. And I can fucking assure you, they\u2019re succeeding so much it\u2019s getting worrying. I know this theory sounds idiotic, but how else would you explain the absolute avalanche of protagonists that are utterly useless as both people AND a mean to advance the storyline further? \\n\\n\r\nSo Junichi is yet another one of those eternal virgin protagonists who have never dated anybody, think mostly about sex and are pitiful when it comes to their contacts with the opposite sex. And I just realized that this entire sentence could\u2019ve ended at \u201canother one\u201d and it wouldn\u2019t lose anything from it\u2019s meaning. That\u2019s really what this dude should be named. \u201cAnother-one-kun\u201d. There\u2019s nothing remotely notable or interesting about him or anything he does. Everything he does and says is a gigantic cliche, used with the subtlety of getting a concrete block dropped on your crotch. We\u2019ve got all the ingredients to make LN protagonist here : constant blushing and stuttering, ridiculously exaggerated reactions, repeated to the point of giving the viewer a desperate death wish, sexual thoughts and delusions - because let\u2019s call things by their proper name for once - nothing\u2019s off limits here. The only missing ingredient here are superpowers pulled from the ass dimension, given to him for no possible reason other than because he happens to be the main character. But thankfully it\u2019s a slice-of-life show, so those are (mostly) out of the question.\\n\\n\r\nBut I kind of wish they weren\u2019t. If they did appear, it would only mean more reasons for me to tear this show to shreds, and even less reasons to feel bad while loudly disclaiming just how horrible it is. \\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one character Junichi reminds me of, it\u2019s the other high school cataclysm from one of the favourite wank-fuels of the modern youth, Issei Hyoudou from High School DxD. He was almost as big of a piece of shit as well, and he was the main reason why I dropped DxD halfway through the second season. But for all of his annoying \u201chilarious pervert\u201d act, I must admit that Issei at least TRIED, you know? I think they all TRIED to make him at least a decent character. He genuinely worked hard to improve himself, and for all of his perviness, he did respect the harem he got, never making a move without being allowed to. And as much as I hated them, some of his sex-driven reactions were actually kind of funny. \\n\\n\r\nBut \u201cmaking a move\u201d isn\u2019t something you should expect from our holy maiden here. He\u2019s far too busy being useless and getting constantly flustered over gestures and, well, just about anything concerning women. For a man so hell-bent on starting a relationship with a woman, he sure doesn\u2019t seem particularily interested in actually progressing said relationship forward. One could wonder if his awkwardness is, perhaps, caused by dating a woman he hasn\u2019t exactly chosen himself. Love is a complicated feeling, after all, and at a young age we don\u2019t quite understand how it works yet.\\n\\n\r\nBut both you and me know that\u2019s not the case. The purpose of Junichi acting like a sexless weirdo is because this is what is expected of a LN protagonist being a part of an ecchi story. We\u2019ve accepted this, we\u2019ve all embraced this at one point or another, and so now this is what we\u2019ll have to deal with. \\n\\n\r\nOn the opposide end we\u2019ve got the main girl of this mess, Yukana Yame. She\u2019s a gal. She has a sexy body, and she\u2019s supposedly different from gals in general. We use the term \u201cgal\u201d here to describe a specific subculture and fashion style, and the show\u2019s entire premise hinges on the concept of breaking stereotypes, I suppose. So gal can be roughly compared to what us Westerners would call a \u201cdumb blonde\u201d stereotype : not very intelligent but hot, has a rather casual approach to sex, dresses provocatively etc. Of course it\u2019s a little bit more complex than this, and has it\u2019s own little quirks, but I won\u2019t dive that deep here. She show surely doesn\u2019t do that too much, so it would only be a waste of time. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters are concerned, Yukana is definitely the best one in this show. She isn\u2019t immediatelly hateable and I believe that with some more skilled writing, she could be made into a pretty interesting girl that would deserve being placed in a better show. She\u2019s also the most visually impressive. And I\u2019m not talking about her body specifically, but about the way she was drawn - her model has by far the highest quality out of anybody else (at least when she\u2019s wearing her school uniform - everything else looks like shit), and the reason is obvious - she\u2019s the main draw of the show. \\n\\n\r\nHer personality... Well, she\u2019s a gal. She\u2019s into fashion, she has blonde hair, dresses sexily, has a friend she hangs out with on a regular basis but, in an unexpected turn of events, turns out she\u2019s actually rather guarded about sex itself. This is the entire plot of this anime : there\u2019s a girl who \u201cshould be\u201d into sex, but is reserved and shy about it. Knowing this, you might think that the main plot point of the anime is not judging people by stereotypes, and to give everybody a chance. You\u2019d think that, but I think it\u2019s clear by now that this show isn\u2019t good enough to handle an idea like this with any degree of proficiency. And if it isn\u2019t clear, it will become clear soon enough.\\n\\n\r\nBonus point earned in the dubbed version : she\u2019s voiced by Jamie Marchi, who you might known from voicing Rias Gremory. And she does fit the role very well. The dialogue is also translated/rewritten to be fittingly cringy, pretentious and difficult to stomach. But the actress herself did a good job. I really do suggest watching this show dubbed, cause with subs it\u2019s not only offensive but just plain boring (see, an upgrade from HS DxD - that one was just boring when subbed).\\n\\n\r\nI was really trying to describe the characters properly and give a wider idea about them, but I find it irrationally difficult. It might be because of how bland and uninteresting they are in general. And you\u2019d think it would be a bad thing, for the main characters to be so horribly written.\\n\\n\r\nFret not, for the writers have prepared a much better feast for us - supporting characters in this show are the absolute powerhouse of it. And as should be expected by now, not in a good way.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, let us take a look at the previously mentioned group of friends Junichi hangs out with.\\n\r\nThere\u2019s three of them, and every single one is equally abhorrent for a completely unrelated reason.\\n\\n\r\nOpening our trifecta of twattery is the Glasses Dude. He acts as the quasi-leader of the group and is a curious patchwork of a salty virgin, generic pervert and the self-proclaimed romance expert - despite having no experience whatsoever. He talks the most and is the most annoying of the bunch, but otherwise has no obviously offending qualities, aside from the lack of any good ones. But this is the case for everybody here, so I\u2019ll let it slide.\\n\\n\r\nThe middle man would be the Loli Lover, and this nickname is much darker and uncomfortable than you\u2019d expect it to be. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we have the first case of conscious pedophilia in anime (aside from hentai and maybe less known adult-rated shows). The creators of this bog had the perfect idea of taking an artstyle/fetish that\u2019s controversial and divisive by default and then crank it up a notch or twelve. So our man makes it abundantly clear from the absolute start - as if, the first FIVE MINUTES of the first episode - that he\u2019s a follower of the old Catch-Em-Young school of dating, precisely stating that it would be perfect if his girlfriend was around 5th grade. That would be around 10-11 years old, just to clear things out. I shouldn\u2019t even have to tell you what is wrong with this, but this is anime, so I\u2019ll do it anyway - it\u2019s creepy as shit. It\u2019s one thing when a character is drawn in a loli manner cause she\u2019s, say, of a petite build like the girls from K-on or Gabriel Dropout. But when we\u2019re talking actual elementary school kids, it gets uncomfortable. Aside from that however, there\u2019s nothing else here. \\n\\n\r\nAnd closing the ranking is the last member of the Circle of Bad Fucking Ideas. He is a different specimen entirely, as it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve come across a character this uninteresting and lacking any shade of personality - and remembering how many shitty harems, romance/ecchi shows and hentais exist, this is a big statement for sure, and one I\u2019m confident in. When the first man was the leader, the third one can be seen as the acting hand of the group, notable in that he was the one who placed the love letter in Yukana\u2019s locker. He might have done something more than this over the course of the series, but I doubt it was anything significant and I can\u2019t be asked to find out. Of the three, he\u2019s has the least offensive qualities, purely because there\u2019s barely any qualities in him to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nAnother notable character here is the resident loli, Nene Fujinoki. Before we get into anything regarding what she\u2019s like, I need to point out one important thing - her visual design.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven\u2019t watched the show, or don\u2019t remember the characters (not bloody surprising, this fact...) just type her name into Google Images and get a good look at her.\\n\\n\r\nJust look.\\n\\n\r\nThe words \u201choly\u201d and \u201cshit\u201d spring to mind. There\u2019s exaggeration, there\u2019s fetishization, and then there\u2019s THIS.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just to drive the point home - this is commercial. As if, somebody was hired to create a character like this. \\n\\n\r\nSomebody drew this. SOMEBODY GOT PAID FOR DRAWING THIS. SOMEBODY\u2019S FUTURE EMPLOYERS WILL SEE THIS AS A PART OF THEIR PORTFOLIO.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve ever felt bad about your work and life choices - remember, at least you\u2019re not that artist...\\n\\n\r\nSo our Z-cup girl here takes the role of the supposed little sister character, barring the fact she and Junichi are literally unrelated in any way - they\u2019re just childhood friends and she acts like his little sister because a check-list required an imouto character to be present, so one has been provided. She\u2019s really into him and spends the show trying to change her style to appeal to him more, but since the main couple is established from the very beginning, it\u2019s obvious that it won\u2019t ever lead anywhere. And this is one thing I kind of need to note - the lack of most of the harem bullshit infesting shows of this nature. Although it doesn\u2019t make it any better, it at least isn\u2019t making it worse. Hardly a praise, but you can\u2019t be picky when we\u2019re dealing with a show where the first frame you see is a close-up of the main girl\u2019s camel toe.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some more characters here, like the main girl\u2019s friend, who gets pissed/jealous cause her gal friend spends less time with her now, so she tries to make the main couple break up by implying Junichi is cheating on Yukana (read - she\u2019s trying to basically rape him) but it never works, another girl from Junichi\u2019s class who\u2019s apparently into cosplay, but we won\u2019t find anything interesting enough to justify such analysis, so let\u2019s move to the next source of constant torment - the visuals.\\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned earlier, Yukana is the only remotely good thing in this show, and sadly, when we look at the visual design itself, this proves true again. While the models themselves aren\u2019t horrible, animation is. Often there\u2019s barely any movement in the scenes, which is particularily notable during face close-ups, and the level of clumsiness gives the works of A-1 Pictures and Studio Deen serious competition. Particularily, there\u2019s that one scene where Yukana goes shopping with Junichi and that other gal girl to look for clothes, and when she picks up a dress, she suddenly looks like she has a completely different body type. Her chest in particular grows to ridiculous size - and yeah, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s flat, but in her uniform her breasts look at least slightly reasonable.The scenes show severe lack of budget and possibly time as well, but for a show like this, it\u2019s not surprising. I doubt anybody was expecting it to be any successful in the first place, so the creators propably decided to take what they could, putting as little money as possible into it, to ensure it\u2019ll run profit even without being largely successful (and somehow it still gained following of sorts...).\\n\\n\r\nSounds design isn\u2019t much better. It just kind of \u201cis there\u201d, so the show doesn\u2019t feel even emptier than it already is. The opening theme is a generic, cutesy j-pop song with nothing appealing whatsoever, and at several times, what I\u2019d refer to as \u201cstock sounds\u201d are used when characters are falling, for example. I know it\u2019s not exactly like every studio records different sounds for every single possible thing happening in the show, but in this particular case, it yet again painfully reminds you how little effort was put when making it. It isn\u2019t even that B-class badness some of you might know. The cheesy, overused stuff that still has some charm to it. This is just bad. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m mad that shows like this still keep popping up, but above everything, it saddens me. It saddens me that shows like this is what people who wish to get into anime might get recommended as one of their first shows. It saddens me that crap like this frequently steals the spotlight from better, much more deserving shows. It saddens me how much damage it does to art, character development, humour and ecchi elements, all of which can be used well in a good show to, if not improve it, then at least help it keep consistent quality. \\n\\n\r\nAnd this crap sells. It pulls views, it pulls numbers, and it\u2019s horrifying. Because with this being the case, it will not be the last one of it\u2019s kind. And somehow, I get the feeling it will not remain the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen for too long. And knowing how rarely I give extreme ratings, I\u2019m absolutely mortified.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s not even like I hate shows of fanservicey nature with simple plots and character development. One of my favourite shows is Shinmai Mao no Testament, which is exactly that. It features young, attractive cast, strong male hero, lots of action and sexy scenes, while also having only 12 episodes (with second season, though). But Testament isn\u2019t a bad show. It\u2019s has plenty of problems, but the main character is humble, likeable and capable. It\u2019s not difficult to understand his reasoning and genuinely like and cheer for him. While the female cast here suffers from being very mediocore - with one exception - no character there is just \u201cbad\u201d. Some of them just aren\u2019t \u201cgood\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal surely has a lot of ecchi scenes, but the general bullshit seeping from every scene makes this show completely wank-proof. \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for a fun high school romance, watch Toradora. If you\u2019re looking for a show where a shy MC is sorrounded by ladies with voluptous bodies, watch Sekirei. If you\u2019re looking for a fun ecchi show, watch Shinmai Mao no Testament, Trinity Seven, Absolute Duo or High School of the Dead.\\n\\n\r\nLeave this thing in peace. It doesn\u2019t deserve your time, it doesn\u2019t deserve your money, and it sure as hell doesn\u2019t deserve any legacy.",

I tend to enjoy this kind of show, but hajimete no gal did not deliver very good characters which is a very important aspect in any type of anime really, but especially for this type. The characters are very flat and there interactions with each other is boring. They don't feellike real people as they only have one or two sides of their personality and rely a LOT on their trope e.t.c Tsundere, loli, lolicon, and so on. You only ever experience that side of the characters. \\n\r\nWhat Hajimete no gal had that not all of these ecchi harem school comedy animes have is a decent romance aspect. It was enjoyable to watch but only two characters had any feelings to show, and even that was pretty static but an enjoyable asset to an anime which only ever else offers fanservice.\\n\r\nIn the end it lacked something to stand out compared to ecchi animes and this had nothing but the slight amount of romance that was not enough to save it. They tried to go with a gal kinda trope to stand out but turned out to be nothing more than extra fanservice.",

            "content": "Let's be honest here, we all came to watch this show for the same reason...\r\nBut to be COMPLETELY honest there was a positive surprise for me after the show started running properly. Hajimete no Gal is a harem-anime, but this harem is not in the standard \"Every girl is completely in love with the MC just because\"-category. It's enjoyable thanks to the main characters, Junichi and Yame and the progression in their relationship, which actually does differ from the mainstream harems quite a bit.\r\nStory: 8 - For a show with not much premise and which only relies on the relationships between certain characters the showsurprises with its funny and sweet moments. Don't expect TOO much though.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6 - The art is not bad, but it's not that good. +The \"jiggliness\" of certain bodyparts is quite distracting even during moments when they are not needed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6 - Again, the sound is not bad, the music is lacking and the characters sound exactly like you would expect them to, but the characters have good parts and the different versions of the MC inside his head are pure gold in a comedic aspect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8 - The whole story's point and the clear winner of the show. Read below for my detailed opinion on the character development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 - I didn't expect to enjoy this show much more than in uh... scientific research purposes only, but I'm actually enjoying the show and I want to see how the characters end up. I want to see a happy ending with these characters (Not you pedophile friend Number 3, rot in a cell and burn in hell).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 - It's a fun show with ecchi for those who are searching for it, but also some normal RomCom aspects that make you invested in atleast a few good characters. I hope to see more of this progress in the future.\\n\\n\r\nSo a detailed opinion on the show:\\n\r\nThe most positive thing I can give for this anime is its way of advancing characters, or atleast the 3 main characters. When the anime starts you'll just think that the Yame and her best friend are just some random sluts that'll mess around with the MC, but as the story moves forward you'll start to see that they're completely different. Yame just wants a cute relationship with a nice guy and sees Junichi as a genuinely nice guy, who sees her for who she really is and her best friend messes with the MC and even hates him because she's trying to protect Yame. \\n\r\nIn short, This anime went from a complete Ecchi-fest to a somewhat sweet story between Yame and Junichi. Now whether or not you're looking for a cute romance is not my problem, there are still those basic pervy scenes with the girls that you can enjoy. I just feel like there might be hope for this anime storywise thanks to the character progression.\\n\\n\r\nI would otherwise rate this anime's characters 9/10 if it wasn't for some FUCKING disgusting parts. For example, there is a literal fucking pedophile in the show. The MC's 3rd friend, a fat fuck, who is only after girls 12 or younger and who LITERALLY says to a girl from preschool \"The only way that I could express my feelings to you would be illegal\". The disgusting piece of shit is meant as a joke and it barely rolled on the first time around. It has really gotten to the point where I should call the police for whoever even came up with him. The MC's friends switch from funny to obnoxious from time to time, but thankfully they serve more as a comic relief and somewhat help with the story.",

            "content": "The reason I wanted to watch Hajimite no Gal was for pure fanservice, and because it was an Ecchi Harem, I immediately clicked the watch link. Little did I know that that's not what I would get, instead, I got one of the cutest romances of the year! (If not the cutest!)\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nA normal looking guy confesses to a girl and she accepts his confession, the cliche level was strong with that one. But what's to applaud is what's *beyond* that confession. Thankfully, this was a relationship anime and not a 'realising my feelings through the season's anime (IYKWIM). The way Hajimite no Gal introducesand presents it's romance is so realistic that In shocked there's no live adaptation yet. Really realistic scenarios (mostly...) and a cute romance is something I'm all for and that's exactly what I got with Hajimite no Gal. Sure, I came for the Ecchi but got a lot of romance in return (and as it's my fav genre I wasn't complaining). Simply put, a unique story about a normal person dating a hot chick but with a whole lot of realism involved. An 8 for sure\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful. 'Nuff said. I fell in love with the way the colors are presented with both the background and the characters. Junichi looks more ordinary as ever (if that could ever happen) and I love the way how the color pink is used especially for Yame-san. Her strawberry blonde hair looks better than most other anime girls with the same hair.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe VAs did a really good job. The characters match their personalities a lot and I'm not just talking about the main characters. The supporting Characters (especially Junichi's friends) sound amazingly accurate to their personas and I loved it. The OP was quite memorable altthough the ending was something I loathed later on and forgot really easily...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThey knocked it out of the park with this one. Seeing an Ecchi anime with good character development is something that happens once in 4 or 5 years or so. The way the characters developed their personalities is not just amazing but unbelievable especially considering it's genres.\\n\\n\r\nJunichi: Our resident Virgin, He confesses to Yame in the first episode and shockingly gets his confession accepted. Most anime would end there but seeing how the anime *starts* off with that, they got more to do. Junichi starts to develop genuine feelings for her and thankfully *not* because of her body, (a major selling point from an Ecchi anime, a genre where boobs = feelings developed). He realises his true feelings and genuinely wants to make Yame happy.\\n\\n\r\nYame: Thank God Yame wasn't a robot with a heavy chest. Most Ecchi anime abuse chest size (even this anime is no exception, featuring a character who's chest is so big it can't fit on a table and is used *as a cushion*) anyways back to Yame. She too has very sensible reasons to like Junichi (I won't spoil it) and in a meduim where girls are branded as 'Deres' Yame escapes that stereotype as she like us humans have multiple feelings within us and are very complex people. The same goes for Yame. And I don't know about you, but that how I saw her character. One of a person who wants others to feel happy, while also wanting their own happiness and depending on other people while also trying to be independent. Multiple feelings right there. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Hajimite no Gal. Not because I write the exact same phrase here in every other of my reviews but because I genuinely enjoyed it to the fullest. It had a super cute Romance, a super cute relationship, a super cute art style and so on. Everything about the anime was cute, and I really loved that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEven though after my calculations I should've rated this a 9, I refrained because even though I enjoyed the anime, there were still a lot of times when I felt that \"This could've happened\" or \"why did this happen\" and \"why did she suddenly feel like that\" and so I had to tone it down. And so I felt Hajimite no Gal is an 8 out of 10 at best. Adorable, funny and soft at heart, Hajimite no Gal is an anime you'll love whether you're married, dating someone or are just a virgin like me (*Cries*). One of the best Romances of 2017!\\n\\n\r\nP.S: It's quite obvious but I'll still make it clear. Yame is best girl <3 and not just because she's beautiful, because she cares for everyone ;)",

            "content": "It\u2019s not very often we get an anime where the main character already has a girlfriend or gets a girlfriend in the first episode and Hajimete no Gal was marketed as the latter. Having never heard of it before, it gave me high hopes for its potential. I had hoped that it would explore some themes that are rarely explored having skipped the hurdle that most anime reserve for its climax and its niche of focusing on gyaru could have led to some interesting conflicts. The gyaru theme explored is essentially \u201cYou thought gyaru are just easy sluts! Well, they\u2019re actually not!\u201d Needless to say,my hopes were dashed.\\n\\n\r\nLike most stories, Hajimete no Gal\u2019s story occurs through story arcs. It\u2019s just unfortunate that most of these story arcs boil down to \u201cOh no, something bad is going to happen to the girl(s). Well, time for the protagonist, Junichi, to temporarily man up and do something.\u201d While the arcs do allow some of the characters to shine-- which result in some of the better moments in the anime\u2014a lot of the conflicts could have been solved or prevented altogether if people would have just sat down and talked it out. This is especially true for the final arc of the anime and also why it was so frustrating to see it play out.  Not only that but even when the good parts are happening, the shot direction can take a turn for the worst like when there is panning upskirt shot of a female character during a tense scene in a caf\u00e9 near the end of the anime as if to say \u201cWe know it\u2019s not that great of a story so here\u2019s some unnecessary eye candy.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nThe story is also filled with blatant clich\u00e9s. For example, despite Junichi clearly be in a relationship with one girl and one girl only, he still manages to develop this pseudo-harem of girls who all want him for one reason or another and he somehow only realizes the girl wants him when the girl in question blatantly tells him. Or \u201cHey it\u2019s the king\u2019s game, let\u2019s conspire to have the girls kiss us!\u201d Or \u201cHey it\u2019s the hot springs, let\u2019s go peek on the girls while they\u2019re naked because we\u2019re not \u2018real men\u2019 if we don\u2019t.\u201d Or \u201cHey, that person\u2019s more attractive than me in basically every way, it sure would be a shame if I had pre-existing self-confidence issues and went into a state of depression which lead to conflict.\u201d The anime doesn\u2019t strive to do anything different and, at the same time, anything it does attempt to do story-wise isn\u2019t executed particularly well.\\n\\n\r\nFor most romcoms, characters are the defining aspect which will most likely make or break the show. Hajimete no Gal\u2019s characters definitely break the show for me. Barely any of the characters have any clear motivation so you don\u2019t really know what makes them tick and the majority of the characters are one-dimensional. Most notorious of these is Junichi\u2019s lolicon friend and the show\u2019s constant reminder to you \u201cOh yeah, did you know he\u2019s a lolicon?\u201d If you were to stop watching each episode the moment the anime reminded you that Junichi\u2019s friend is, in fact, a lolicon, you would probably never be able to watch a single episode in its entirety, it\u2019s really that bad. Junichi\u2019s other two friends are the blue-haired guy with glasses who is a super otaku who is also the mastermind of the group and the blonde guy who I think is an avid gamer. All four of the males are perverted and they definitely give off a Prison School vibe. It\u2019s just that Hajimete no Gal\u2019s male group is the stale, knock-off, store-brand-cereal-tossed-in-the-clearance-bin version of the group from Prison School. You can tell by the lack of names of these characters in describing them how memorable they were to me. None of Junichi\u2019s friends are really developed in any way and despite being the main protagonist, Junichi\u2019s own development seems stunted and/or extremely slow because it doesn\u2019t seem like he changes much through the course of the anime\u2019s ten episodes, if at all. By the end of the anime\u2019s tenth episode, Junichi doesn\u2019t seem to accomplish much other than manage to keep his girlfriend and maybe gain a little confidence. Other than that, Junichi is essentially just used as the conduit for most of the fanservice in the show, whether it\u2019s through his random fantasizing or simply existing around the four main girls.\\n\\n\r\nOn the flip side, the four main girls of the anime are Yame, Ranko, Kashii, and the childhood friend in major need of breast reduction surgery who also calls Junichi \u201cOnii-chan\u201d. Of the entire cast, Ranko and Kashii are definitely my favorites and are coincidentally also the most developed characters in the entire show but I\u2019ll first address the final and the first of the four girls, in that order. The childhood friend in major need of breast reduction surgery who also calls Junichi \u201cOnii-chan\u201d is essentially how I would describe that character to someone who\u2019s never seen the show and it\u2019s also her character in a nutshell. But, there\u2019s an extra layer of being an emotional support imouto who wants to be seen as a woman by Junichi and also have sex with him and marry him because childhood friends of the opposite sex need to make marriage promises when they\u2019re young but only one of them remembers that promise being made in the first place. In the beginning, she had a fairly annoying running gag that involved her literally running but that stopped after she developed more as a character and began intruding on Yame and Ranko when Junichi was around. Despite being the \u201cmain\u201d heroine, Yame seems strangely underdeveloped. We know she\u2019s an overall nice person who is often adverse to lewd things despite the stereotypes surrounding gyaru and is in love with Junichi but, perhaps due to the story revolving around Junichi\u2019s point of view, she\u2019s consistently somewhat of an enigma. While her actions obviously follow a clear line of logic that makes complete sense to her, the audience is often just completely oblivious to what\u2019s happening in her mind so her actions can seem somewhat random or confusing to the audience-surrogate Junichi, which is a main component of the conflict in the final arc. Ranko, on the other hand, seems surprisingly more developed than the main girl Yame. She actually has some character motivation, however simple, and she definitely steals the spotlight at times. She also gets some random meta love at times like when Ranko was dressed up as Miki Sayaka from Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica in the cosplay caf\u00e9 was an interesting nod as her Japanese voice actress, Kitamura Eri, also voiced Sayaka, though this may have just been completely coincidental. Weirdly enough, the character with the most development is Kashii, who ends up going through her own character arc that ends up spanning most of the anime and even ends up solving a conflict on her own while Junichi is busy yelling about how morally inferior someone else is.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as sound design goes, the sound effects are the typical stock affair you can find pretty much anywhere and the music is forgettable. While the voice actors seem to do their best with what they\u2019re given, they\u2019re rarely given anything that allows them to work their magic. Overall, the sound design in the anime is average at best but there are still points where it misses its mark.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are definitely where the anime falls on its face the most. The animation consistently feels lazy or incompetent and I often found myself surprised when there were legitimately good sections of animation, however rare they were. There are often times where the characters themselves look off-model with their body parts being over or under-sized and, on top of that, looking poorly drawn. The eyes, in particular, will often be lopsided on characters\u2019 faces and tend to have an overall lifeless look to them for most characters, which seems to be particularly true for Yame.\\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal is an anime a few good parts but its many flaws simply hold it back from being average and, even for a \u201cguilty pleasure\u201d anime, it falls short of almost all others in its category. It manages hits that sweet point where it\u2019s essentially unrecommendable; it\u2019s definitely not good but, at the same time, it doesn\u2019t quite reach the point of \u201cso bad it\u2019s good\u201d infamy.\\n\\n\r\n3 out of 10",

            "content": "Now before I start this review, I must say that this is my first review, and I'm currently reading the manga to this, and that I enjoy it quite a bit. Now this adaption on the other hand is a disaster. Now I HIGHLY recommend reading the manga to this instead of watching the anime, this adaption doesn't give the full idea or feelings that the manga gives and is far from enjoyable. This also happens to be the first manga that I've read before an adaption was released.\r\nWhere to even start with this? The plot and timeline in the adaption is horrendous. Every plotscene and small moments that made the manga enjoyable was either skipped, replaced with a lousy filler, or COMPLETELY rushed just so they could get to the beach episode and finish the anime with fillers.\\n\\n\r\nThe timeline too is completely flipped around as scenes that happened around chapter 30 in the manga, were shown well before scenes from the early teens in the manga. The producers gave no extra thought to the effort Ueno put and just disregarded the plot and changed what they wanted in order to provide either more fanservice or just half-assed plot. Now I don't mind fillers or fanservice, but not when they interrupt and completely change every single thing that happened in the manga. The scenes that they did keep, were rushed to point where they showed it for less than a minute, then went straight back into fillers.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, who in the right mind thought that when making each episode that adding as much jokes about pedophiles as they could would be funny and good idea?\\n\\n\\n\r\n*SPOILERS BELOW*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow the points that made me really upset. Why did they feel the need to completely flip the good plot scenes around? During the earlier episodes when Kashii appeared and became a problem for Yame and Hashiba, they didn't go to a cafe to have fanservice thoughts of doing it. No, they went to a mall so he could buy a cute present for Yame but did they show that? No, they only wanted as much emphasis on the sexual interactions between the two. I doubt that they'll even show that wonderful scene we saw in the manga recently with the key chains, why? Because they went and thought that making Hashiba jealous in the final episodes instead of Yame would make for a better end to the anime when it ends next week.",

There was generous helpings of panty and boob shots and some of the scenes were quite lewd but nothing unsavoury. However most of all this anime was a light hearted comedy.\r\nThe plot revolves around a clueless young man who, almost by accident, starts dating a girl out of his league and ends up getting his first taste of teenage romance. Including the highs, lows and general confusion that comes along with it. I feel youprobably mispent or are misspending your teenage years if you can't draw any connection to the characters. \\n\\n\r\nI would reccomend this to people who were not robots during their formative years and don't think anime should exclusively be lolis patting each other or musclely dudes beating eachother to a pulp whilst explaining every action they perform in excruciating detail. :)\\n",

If you can power through the first few episodes I think you'll enjoy it. The typical harem rom-com but the Main character's male friends definitely made it very enjoyable for me. I didn't care for the others too much. The music was very good and there was one scene where there was some edm/dubsteb which was appropriate for the scene along with the typical anime piano/orchestral music. To be honest, the ecchi and fantasy scenes somewhat takeaway from the story and just isn't needed. I suppose this is typical for most ecchi anime.",

Sometimes you just have to force yourself to watch a bad anime for the sole purpose of warning others about it.\r\nHajimete no Gal is the epitome of everything wrong with male and female relationships when both parties are inexperienced and clueless. You get these ridiculous characters that make you cringe in disappointment every time they do anything. The saddest part is you don't even want to see the guys in this show get laid, because they are so annoyingly beta that they don't deserve it. This type of character is OKas a gag character, the problem with this anime is it takes this to the point of absurdity. Dudes completely flip out and drop their pants at the slightest hint of female attention. It happens so often ( As in once every 30 seconds ) that it isn't funny, it's just boring. You can only repeat the same joke every so often before it's no longer a joke and just becomes a liability to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with this anime is that it just isn't entertaining. This trope has been done before hundreds of thousands of times and far better. HnG tries to be original by making the female characters more realistic, but the result just makes them unlikable since they still obey the generic rules of romcom Anime IE fawning over an irritatingly weak and equally unlikable male MC. \\n\\n\r\nI could give this a longer review, but to be frank this show just doesn't deserve one. It's generic. The characters are boring. It's hackneyed attempt at originality for including a \"gal\" is pathetic and not even done correctly. There's no plot. It's a bad show period. \\n\\n\\n",

And during every season, I would checkout the various shows that piqued my interest.  One show that interested me was Hajimete no Gal.  Since, I was familiar with the source material, I expected an adequate adaptation.  Unfortunately, my expectations were not met.  I wanted the show to focus on the growing relationship between the two main characters and their many \u201cfirsts\u201d.  Instead, what I watched was a shoddy story-line with rushed plot events and one-dimensional characterswith no development or backstory.  In other words, a shitty adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\\n\r\nJunichi Hashiba, a 2nd year high school student, has entered his Spring semester and is surprised that he still doesn\u2019t have a girlfriend.  His friends, in the same predicament, decide break the status quo, and vote on who will confess to Yame Yukana, a high school gyaru.  And that lucky person is Junichi.  Forced to confess, he goes through with it and anticipates to be rejected, but is shocked when Yame agrees.  And so, begins the relationship between Junichi and Yame and their many \u201cfirsts\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nWell, it was supposed to be like that\u2026but it didn\u2019t.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what the fuck happened?  Well, someone at NAZ studios had the grand idea to rush plot events and condense them into single episodes, in fact this happened three times (i.e. Ranko Honjou\u2019s, Nene Fujinoki\u2019s, and Yui Kashii\u2019s arcs).  And if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, they removed many of Junichi\u2019s and Yame\u2019s relationship development, such as their first date, first kiss, first \u2018touch\u2019, etc.  This results in a more weakened and less personal relationship.  So, what happens to Yame Yukana?  Well, she is treated like another girl in Junichi\u2019s harem.  Even though there is no harem tag, you can tell most of the girls like Junichi. \\n\\n\r\nAnd since, the major storylines were wrapped up in five episodes, the remaining episodes were dedicated to increased screen time for the three stooges (i.e. Shinpei Sakamoto, Minoru Kobayakawa, and Keigo Ishida), increased fanservice and ecchi content, increased amount of original content not seen in the manga (i.e. part-time job at a cosplay cafe, beach episode, \u2018king game\u2019 event, etc), and the inclusion of various references to other shows.  Even, the added \u2018drama\u2019 in the end, that is the introduction of some good-looking dude, doesn\u2019t help this weak story-line, as everyone know how the results will play out.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, the show has terrible pacing and structure.  One moment a new character is introduced, then problems occur with that new character, and finally a conclusion is reached.  And this all happens in one episode.  Throw in a couple of horrible and cringe-worthy dialogue, and some stupid, random immature humor, and we have an series that\u2019s not worth remembering.  Overall, the story is absolute garbage.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION:\\n\\n\r\nThe art, as commonly seen in many romantic-comedies, has very bright and vibrant colors that jump out at the viewers.  And, it should be no surprise that the tone of this show is lighthearted, and not serious at all.  The background designs and animations, while not very detailed and spectacular, are fine.  The male character designs are bland and nothing striking, besides the exaggerated facial expressions when \u2018things\u2019 happen.  The female designs were definitely made for fanservice in mind, as almost everyone has large, oversized breast compared to bowling balls, and nice curves and asses.  My only complaint is the noticeable pointy chin on some characters.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s opening and ending is your standard J-Pop, featuring all the female leads that like our main character.  Nothing more than that.  The voice acting is actually pretty good, leading to most characters expressing a wide range of emotions and reactions.  For example, Junichi Hashiba always sounds nervous, shocked, and surprised.  Ranko Honjou sounds assertive and aggressive.  Yame Yukana is always teasing, playful, and sometimes jealous.  Overall, the sound design is fine.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\\n\r\nMost characters in this show are one-dimensional and lack character development or backstory.  It\u2019s especially prevalent for the male characters.  The three stooges are annoying, cringe-worthy,  and obnoxious, especially the fat character, who is a self-declared pedophile.  The good-looking dude, at the end of the show, is a douche-bag.  And Junichi Hashiba is weak, unconfident, and a pervert, who manages to attract beautiful and popular girls.  Overall, the male characters are uninteresting and unfunny.  The female characters are fine and not as annoying and brain-dead as the male characters, but they could be better.  Most of them have motives and reasons for liking Junichi Hashiba, except, the main heroine, herself, as we are never given a proper reason for why she likes Junichi.  Still, if they had included most of the development from the manga, the show would be more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nTo really \u201cenjoy\u201d this show, it\u2019s best to find an uncensored version, so that you can view every semi-nude, pantie, and breast scene without the annoying, yet hilarious censors (i.e. hearts, hands, disco-balls, etc).  Now, in my opinion, the show is inferior to its manga counterpart in almost every manner.  The rushed plots events combined with some annoying and obnoxious characters made my viewing experience dreadful.  I don\u2019t recommend watching this show, unless you are an ecchi fanatic.",

            "content": "This reminded me so much of Nisekoi: MC with no balls, Harem style, even the art style is similar. The random fantasies our MC has do nothing but contribute to the fanservice seekers, especially how they are randomly thrown willy-nilly in the middle of an interaction. Arguably that could be what makes it slightly realistic; plenty of people have fantasies about beautiful girls, but to have the character suddenly space out right in the middle of a conversation and get sort of lost in his little dream for me greatly cuts into the story.\r\nStory - 5/10. Very simple plot, Junichi, a nerdy boy wants toget girls, somehow he's more popular than he could've ever imagined, and has multiple who want him. I am kind of curious about how this will turn out and if he will ever actually choose one girl and stay loyal to her. I have seen several anime like this where the MC chickens out in the end, after waiting for so long for the MC to make a freakin choice already (much disappoint!) I really hope that Furukawa does not do the same thing. In terms of the story, it honestly feels like Nisekoi without all the \"from the past\" drama. School setting, harem, no balls male MC. IMO, not much unique to the story, it is very generic.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10. The art is one of the story's better selling points. The settings in the anime are pretty detailed, similar in style to Nisekoi; kind of bright, with a comforting feel to it, big eyes, the works.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6/10. Generic, not much too unique. None of the characters (except for the pedo) have particularly annoying voices, and there is not much explosive volumes in the anime. Relaxed overall sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5/10. Junichi (MC) is weak, without guts. Sure he can take some risks, such as asking out Yukana in the first place, and yes he was noble rejecting Kashii in the latest episode (4 as of today). Hopefully he grows a pair and can learn how to say no a bit better. The other characters are too generic for my liking. We have Sakamoto (extravagant Megane character), Kobayakawa (creepy lolicon), and Isheida (looks badass but is as useful as a Magikarp) for the supporting characters. Yukana (\"the one\" is a tsund/happy go lucky kind of character), Kashii (the sadistic princess who hides behind a smile), Fujikoni (big chested loli/childhood friend), and Ranko (basically Nikumi from FW in terms of appearance and a random lesbian rival of Junichi). It is difficult nowadays with how many anime there are out there to come up with unique character design, but it really doesn't feel like Furukawa was trying at all. All the characters are generic or feel like repeats of other characters we've already seen before.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5/10. It's more of a \"guilty pleasure\" sort of enjoyment, again, it feels too generic to be considered unique or entertaining in my opinion, but I still enjoy its attempts to try and be unique, such as adding random acts of fanservice here and there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5/10. Not the best anime I have ever seen, nothing in particular stands out. It feels like everything in this anime has been done before.",

Seeing the harem tag below the show\u2019s descripto didn\u2019t help things either. By then I no longer needed the pump, I was ready for a night around the town, a soir\u00e9e all to myself watching oppai\u2019s galore\u2026or so I thought.\r\nMake no mistake, there were titties (well sorta) \u2026and sexuality played an important part in setting up the story. However, I felt like there was more to it than the obscenity that was running rampant throughout\u2026Was Iwrong in thinking this harem actually tried dropping knowledge bombs on its viewership? And am I a blithering idiot for actually having learned something of value from watching this show? Let\u2019s find out.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, I'd like to pay my respects towards the writers of the dub (yeah, I only watch dubs\u2026wanna fight about it?). The dialogues (and monos) are good\u2026like really good! Heck! The artistic value of what\u2019s been scripted for this show is superb. I didn\u2019t cough up a lung whilst watching this\u2026but that\u2019s only because I had passed out from laughing so hard before that were to happen. Not only was it a blast to see Funi\u2019s best showmen being put to work on this one\u2026but it was also refreshing to catch up on the latest memes, tropes, troll baits\u2026and best of all: Freaking Yoda Impersonations!!\u2026like what the Ef!?! Simply Glorious. It\u2019s like the show packed all its humour into a tiny little brief-case: here you are expecting for a disaster to happen but\u2026to everyone\u2019s surprise, it fits. \\n\\n\r\nNow don\u2019t go thinking this show is a roller-coaster ride to funsville from beginning to end. It has its serious moments. And by serious, I mean enough to kick you in the feels\u2026several times over. It\u2019s this combination of both humour and earnestness that got me to consider this show without at least a couple shots of vodka in me\u2026I\u2019m taking a harem show seriously boiz!\u2026someone needs to stop me now.\\n\\n\r\nBut no really, the delivery behind every single scene was well-crafted; granted episodes 7 and 8 were starting to annoy me, the show nicely concludes thereafter, giving this impression that the story was based around core values that simply worked for it.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m a virgin\u2026and this show made me say it out loud on MAL. In effect, the series tries teaching, or at least showcasing, the importance in having self-confidence, so that one can, in turn, confide in others. Moreover, by playing with concepts such as \u201cLosers\u201d and \u201cWinners\u201d, or, as the show puts it, \u201cAlphas\u201d and \u201cBeta Cucks\u201d, we get to see Hajimete No Gal elaborate on much of what is going on today\u2026in the real world (yup, THAT wretched thing).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I mean what other series make jokes about cucks and raps about pussy. The only comparison I can see with this showis Ghost stories. Ghost stories is a series where the Japanese partners gave the dub almost complete freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted.

Well, he is, and the show sure won't let himself or us forget the fact. It is what drives him into the arms of the seemingly slutty gal Yame. In time however it begins to dawn on our protagonist that this girl might be more to him than just a means towards a sexual end. Also, could it be Yame is not really a slut after all? Learn from and grow with Junichi as he walks the path of becoming a proper boyfriend. Apath littered with prejudice, self-loathing, otakus, pedophiles, tsundere girls, boobs with girls, and so much more (Disclaimer: can, but needs not include actual loss of virginity).\\n\\n\r\nMediocre animation, unimaginative character designs, a so-so soundtrack and, most of all, an unoriginal premise make for a bad show, which Hajimete no Gal undoubtedly is. The few nice moments Yame and Junichi share can't remedy the overall blandness the series and its cast suffer from. If you were in the mood of wasting your time then this review shoud have done the trick, the show in question is not worth it.",

            "content": "So before I start this review, I wanna talk about the manga. I was convinced by a friend I trusted to pick this up because the source had good romance and ecchi, and I've been looking for something to fill those criteria. After watching a decent amount of this adaptation, I was really not impressed by what it had to offer. That same friend continued to tell me the source was good, so I picked it up to see how different it was from the anime. I'll just tell you here that most of the issues I'll talk about are fixed in the manga, sodon't let this anime deter you from trying it yourself. I have the manga at 8 currently and I recommend it to everyone to at least give it a chance, whether you have or have not watched the adaptation.\\n\\n\r\n~\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler Free Review\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to describe Hajimete no Gal in a sentence, I would call it a pseudo harem pretending to be a romantic comedy. But I have more than a sentence so to add onto that, this show is an utter mess. What seemed like a show that might have had actual romance and chemistry, disappoints everyone by failing to provide any progression for the couple, focusing instead on characters that no one wants to see. Harems can be good if the characters are all likeable and funny, and if the drama and romance are entertaining, but Hajimete fails to provide a noteworthy cast or any development that could muster more than a sigh of exasperation.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to describe Hajimete no Gal in a sentence, I would call it a pseudo harem pretending to be a romantic comedy.

Harems can be good if the characters are all likeable and funny, and if the drama and romance are entertaining, but Hajimete fails to provide a noteworthy cast or any development that could muster more than a sigh of exasperation.\\n\\n\r\nThe only decent character in this series is Yukana Yame, our main girl. A gyaru on the outside but a sweetheart on the inside, you can't help but like her as she plays the role of the girlfriend pretty well. Our main Junichi Hashiba is not that bad either, he's pathetic but he tries his best, however he has a bunch of voices in his head, acting as characters, that freak out over every little situation that involves a girl. It's incredibly annoying when you're trying to watch something only to be interrupted by a bunch of imaginary idiots having a meltdown over kissing someone. The rest of our cast could honestly burn horrifically and I wouldn't care. Let's start with the worst offenders, the friends of Junichi. Their only real role is to provide comic relief as we laugh at how pathetic they are cause they're virgins. Funny right? Not really. Minoru Kobayakawa is a lolicon, and this fact is shoved into our face every chance possible as we see him drooling over little girls to the point that it's actually creepy. They take it way too far, pushing it past the point of being funny and just making us hate every scene he's part of. Shinpei Sakamoto is an otaku and a pervert, but he acts like an expert on women, throwing around bullshit facts and advice about dating. The worst part is that our main usually believes him, causing him to mess up as a boyfriend. Shinpei drags down the romance for the sake of a try-hard attempt at humour, ruining what a lot of people are watching this show for. Keigo Ishida is not really a major offender, but he doesn't provide much either. He's just there to back up Shinpei, look down on Minoru and act as the third pathetic stooge. The rest of the girls are only thrown in for drama and fanservice, they have no other purpose to them. They also take away valuable screen time that could have been used to develop the relationship between Junichi and Yame, but are instead used for generic harem antics. In fact, the show uses two of its character, Ayumi Uesaka and Kokoro Shiina, as voices for the next episode previews. You barely see or hear from them except to act as off screen friends of Yame, their only reason to exist is to complain about how little we see of them at the end of each episode.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the drama is only there to make our main Junichi look like a decent person, even though the show also continues to portray him as pathetic and sad. A situation happens between Junichi and another character that forces our main to either defend Yame or comply with the whims of the other character. Of course, Junichi will always choose his girlfriend, showing the audience how great of a boyfriend he is. At least, that's whats supposed to happen. This type of drama would be nice, except the execution and repetitiveness of it causes the show to fail at making any real impact on the romance or the audience. It causes most episodes to feel cheap and cringy, and it also pushes the focus of the anime onto the supporting cast, causing us to hate them even more. What are suppose to be our mains are dragged through the dirt as we're expected to laugh at the ridiculousness and stupidity that the side characters create when all we want is an actual reason to why a couple was established in the first place when they barely get touched on.\\n\\n\r\nNow for an anime to do ecchi well, the art style and animation must look great. However, as a way to make us hate the show even more, they can't even do this right. Mistakes which can only be described as lazy are littered throughout the anime, pulling away our attention from the story and turning it into a game of \"What did they animate wrong this episode?\" The fanservice is mostly from the wild imagination of Junichi or from generic beach and hot spring scenes. I for one do not mind when an episode decides to focus on tits and ass, especially if it's an ecchi, but none of the ecchi scenes look particularly nice or fit in well with the rest of the scene, and it usually focuses on characters that we don't care for. There are times where the ecchi actually looks great and don't feel out of place, but these are usually all in the head of our main and are buried under the terrible elements of the show.\\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal is a train wreck. It takes a perfectly decent manga and throws away everything good about it, turning it into a love letter to bad harems. If you've already watched this anime, pick up the manga so you can see exactly how different the two are. If you have yet to start it, stay away from this at all costs. Forget this exists and just read the source.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, send any feedback if you have any!",

            "content": "Gyarus otherwise known as Gals are hot, at least in anime, but that can be said about any type of character. What really makes them stand out for me is their promiscuous and assertive nature, while being able parade their body around in a sexual manner like it\u2019s nobodies business. With that in mind the show presents a romance story with a gal in the mix in order to shake it up only to be a sub-par standard rom-com that just sets into being a bad harem-\u201dcomedy\u201d.\r\nThe story of the show follows Junichi a high schooler who has one thing in his mind, and thatis wanting to get laid. The problem  however is that he and his friends are total losers, which is no surprise given the way they act in class. It would seem that all hope would be lost if it weren\u2019t  for his friends suggesting he go with a gal because of how \u201ceasy\u201d they are to get with. This of course lead to Junichi begging Yame the main girl into going out with him which for whatever reason she agrees to. While they do start going out, the show focuses less on their relationship and more on introducing more gals into the mix. While fine the first time since it was yame\u2019s friend they overdone it with the next two, as it became repetitive with each new girl being propped up in order to be placed in in junichi\u2019s slowly growing harem.  \\n\r\nYou may think it\u2019s ridiculous to call it a harem as he already has yame, but after getting all the girls the next few episodes are dedicated on the entire group and just taking a step back it really just is a harem show. What really nails the coffin for this show are the final two episodes like most incomplete adaptations tires to rile up the final moments with tension and drama only to fall back into the status quo with nothing truly getting resolved, and this show is no exception. It becomes obvious from the time it starts that it\u2019s an obvious bait and switch. While they aren\u2019t the first one to do it, and surely not the last, it just shows that the show didn\u2019t have much going for it. \\n\\n\r\nWho cares about the story anyway. This is a romance story where the characters and their chemistry matter the most. Yet even in this department the show does a terrible job at doing this. Junichi our main character who follows the nothing special archetype is mostly dragged along for the ride starting with his friends tricking him to go out with yame. Which is odd considering while they are trying to reap off junichi reward of establishing a connection with the gal crowd, they also get jelous and lambast him for progressing in his relationship. Anyway he\u2019s dragged along in the relationship, and mostly reacting to anything yame or any of the other girls do. This also becomes the main source of the comedy which takes place in his horny little mind as he goes on these wild fantasies or getting lucky. I guess he does develop a bit in the end when he see\u2019s yame as a person he loves rather than a goal to lose his virginity, but it\u2019s not much considering it was the only path it would have really gone. \\n\r\nThe supporting characters at least for the males barely get anything in terms of characterization and are one note with junichi\u2019s friends being glasses guy, blond guy, and fat pedophile. The women do get better characterization since each has an episode dedicated to them, but it\u2019s really not that much. I would have put yame in her own separate category if it weren\u2019t from the fact that she really is just a part of the harem with her title being [actual girlfriend]. Each girl having their sights locked onto junichi due to their rather flimsy, contrived, or unexplained motivations. What\u2019s more apparent about these gals is that they're all probably virgins as well which is obvious for 3/4 since one is kind of a lesbian for yame and the other two are pretending to be gals. Yame herself is also hinted at being a virgin because despite her teasing nature towards junichi, she really has a tough time for the more sexual stuff like reading an erotic book. Which is a real damn shame as it loses that promiscuity of what makes a gal so great, it\u2019s not like start off virgins are the only characters suitable for romance anime righhht... \\n\\n\r\nThe production value for the show already looks dated and looks like it was made during the mid to late 2000\u2019s. while being colorful and vibrant like most rom-coms for their light hearted tones, it\u2019s also follows the same stock format as similar shows with a notable example being characters who blushes go across and out of their faces. The only character designs that really looked good were Yame and Ranko because they are supposed to look like gals and therefore look slutish and attractive. Everyone else looks bland or bad such as bowling ball tits nene and pedo-man. Don\u2019t expect anything in terms of animation except for some bouncing boobs every once in awhile.  The show also sounds ok. The soundtrack is really nothing notable and the voice acting is competent enough for the show, but that\u2019s about it. \\n\\n\r\nThe best way i can describe the show is the same way i can describe the gals in the show. It\u2019s too damn tame. Even the uncensored version of the show looks tamed in comparison to other shows like DXD. it had a concept that could have dealt with subjects such as sex and love, but instead opts for having characters who are a certain archetype in name only and basically becoming just another rom-com without much rom or com. Even a hentai would be better because at least there would be some pay-off",

I should have dropped this long time ago if not for the relationship of Yukana and Junichi. (That's the only good thing I can get here). The show just gives you a good couple at the first 10 minutes. The next thing you know, they throw all sorts of cliche character like an overly attached Loli with boobs in the size of Fuji Mountain, a Yandere tanned bitch (this is new), a tsundere (possibly Yandere), and ourgeneric female leads which has nothing special except that she's the girlfriend of our male leads (and boobs. Don't forget boobs).\\n\\n\r\nNow, not that I hate it, Hell, I even gave it a 7/10 (MyAnimeList doesn't let me give 6.5 rating so, I'll give it a 7). The relationship story is pretty nice. I think that's all the good thing here. The supporting characters are a nuisance and the show will be a lot better without them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, pretty generic in my opinion even though they serve a nice relationship story. Other than that, this is just another generic harem, ecchi anime",

This isn't highschool dxd or clannad (ecchi/harem, romance) IT IS A COMEDY and when you stop looking at it as anything other than that is the only time you can enjoy it. that is why everything except enjoyment is a 7. The art is just like regular anime, sound is prettyaverage, the story is kinda dumb but i've seen a lot worse and the characters are just definitions of tropes. But the reason it gets an 8 is because the enjoyment was far beyond a 10. This is one the funniest anime i've ever watched the only thing that comes close is the beginning few episodes of ore monogatari  i just enjoyed it  and anyone that can enjoy adult humor or a \"switch up\" from \"normal\" anime will love this. Kinda sad there are only ten episodes tho...",

            "content": "*This review may seem vague, but im doing my best to not spoil anything.*\r\nI decided to watch this anime after seeing that one of my favorite voice actresses was in the dub. I thought I was going to drop it after the first episode, however it was actually really enjoyable. I found the dub to be hilarious and quite endearing. If you look past all the ecchi, this really is a good anime. Most of the characters have a good amount of emotional depth and one can easily relate to them. Of course there are the dorky, overly perv characters (and one character that icant stand), but most of them seem quite human and all of them have their quirks.\\n\\n\r\n Yet, over the course of the show many characters become more mature in ways, its really nice to see some personal growth in a show like this. Another thing that's great about this show is that while it is an ecchi anime, and it does have its tropes, it does break away from some elements that are commonly related with this type of anime. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the show isnt perfect. The story is kind of generic, but it was well done. The art style is colorful but not overly spectacular. Some members of the cast were overly annoying but luckily those characters were more or less in the \"supporting\" category.  \\n\\n\r\nI would like to give one piece of advice if you want to watch this show though. The first episode was painful to watch (at least to me). It literally took me a solid 2 hours to get through it, because i was pausing it so much to question \"why the hell am i even watching this\" every 30 seconds. The second episode was also kind of painful but that was because I was seriously jaded by the first. It starts to get its legs in the 2nd episode, so if you watch it, please take the first episode with a grain of salt. It gets so much better afterword.",

            "content": "well... i'm here again! because its a seasonal anime.\r\nSO what do i think about this anime? kinda disappointing, kinda okay-ish. A bit torn\r\nStory: 6\r\nNot a bad story overall. A very generic rom-com/ semi-harem vibe. Its not exactly the best, but its not like overly bad either. its pretty...generic. You get some laughs, you get some romance, you get some ecchi. And thats all good, but like i've said before, anime should be pushing the boundaries of whats possible, and this stays pretty safely in reality. Maybe that's just me, but it lacked something that could have put it beyond what it is now. The premiseis easy to follow, the MC is an idiot, but again, nothing really stands out in this anime. Its not romantic enough, funny enough or ecchi enough to be memorable. which is why its good, but not great. Oh yea, and the story is predictable at the end.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nIt's a new anime, so the art is good. Some proportions may be off (some proportions may be waaaaay off), but overall its nice, its bright. colors are a bit too... clashing for my liking, but Overall not bad. Its not as sharp or high quality as i would like to see, and the art style is kinda...childish. Also maybe its just me or do the 4 guys bear an eerie similarity to the 4 boys of prison school? in design anyways. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nHonestly its again, not bad, but not amazing either. none of the opening or closing songs caught my attention, the songs in the anime didn't do much to build on emotions/tensions. But there is some sound. Its just not memorable. I will give some props to VA selection, they were not bad. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nthere was absolutely no character development. characters stay exactly the same throughout the story. They're more ornaments to the story rather than directors of it. They feel... static, the story flows around them and they do nothing. They're funny, they provide comic relief, but again, they dont go over the top about anything. so a very average score for that. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nUnfortunately had to go 5 again. It's enjoyable to some extent. Its not painful to watch. Its just predictable. I enjoyed it, but not superbly. Its just another mediocre anime that does its time. As someone who actually immensely enjoys the rom-com ecchi genre, this was both good and bad at the same time. the comedy was good, ecchi was present, and romance was decent, but thats all it really was. it wasn't something i would reccommend, or something i would say is amazingly funny or anything\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:6\\n\r\nSo for a predictable story around some static characters, a 6 isn't too bad. Though personal bias is playing into it somewhat. Sometimes i think about this anime and i like it, sometimes i don't. Its not groundbreaking in what it does, but it does at least provide what you expect from it. The romance of it is okay, a bit childish, but serviceable. The comedy is funny, but not exactly sidesplitting. itll make you snort a bit, but not laugh out loud. The ecchi is there but sadly THERE ARE NO NIPS. THERE ARENT EVEN NUDE SCENES. yea.overall just a very generic, decent anime. Broken down it would probably be 1 for story + 3 for ecchi +1 for enjoyment + 1 for art = 6 overall\\n\\n\r\nPeace",

            "content": "There's a scene in episode five where three girls smash their boobs together to compare cup sizes. That is everything you need to know about Hajimete No Gal. There is nothing redeemable about this anime besides trashy fanservice. If you hate trashy fanservice, don't watch. If you like trashy fanservice, soldier on forward you man of culture you.\r\nEvery episode features a handful of dream-like sequences where the main character imagines himself being seduced by his new hot girlfriend that he doesn't deserve. Scumbaggy? Probably. Entertaining nevertheless? Absolutely. It's harmless erotic fun that every healthy male entertains when they see a hot girl made extra sensualbecause anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing you ask from an anime with a stupid premise is that it embraces it's stupidity and Hajimete no Gal does this well.\u00a0There are several moments of outright hilarity because of how absurd the situations are and there's\u00a0a level of self aware comedy that can be endearing to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is not endearing however are the male characters. They are the most pathetic excuses for testicles I've ever seen in anime and that's saying something. The main guy is a spineless virgin with no personality who's too scared to touch his attractive harem for whatever reason shared by 99% harem lead characters. He is friends with terrible people none worse than a fat pedophile who openly displays his desire to fuck kids. That is every bit as creepy as it sounds. I don't understand why they thought it would be a good idea to do this.\\n\\n\r\nThis is somewhat balanced out by a cast of gorgeous female characters. All of them are super hot and the anime does well to put them in super hot positions to the delight of the viewer. I swear every single time I thought I was getting bored with this anime there was a sudden ass shot to make me interested again. \\n\\n\r\nAs with all fanservice anime these days there's a chance the quality is upgraded when the blu ray is released. And by quality I mean the possibility of nudity so we may not have seen the best this anime has to offer quite yet, stay tuned. \\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal is everything it appears to be at first glance and it doesn't take much effort to know whether or not you'll like this anime. I mean literally, look at the thumbnail in the upper left hand corner. That's everything you need to know. Its solid if you just want some cheap laughs and hot ecchi moments but if looking for anything more than that you'll obviously be disappointed.",

The catch this time is that the girl is a Gyaru/Gal which is a slang term that originated from a 1970s brand of jeans called \"gurls\", with the advertising slogan: \"I can't live without men\", and was applied to fashion- and peer-conscious girls in their teens and early twenties. Essentially they are females that focus a lot on fashion and are usually stereotyped to be floozies. Yame-San, The main female and gal of the show, is actually extremely pure hearted and despite being a gal is a nice and kind person. \\n\\n\r\nThe story just follows MC (can\u2019t even remember his name, he is literally that boring) and Yame as they try to establish some sort of relationship where MC asks Yame out in the hopes that he might get laid (but later actually develops feelings for her) and Yame who teases MC (but seems to be pretty smitten by him because he\u2019s so\u2026 nice?!?!? It\u2019s never explained why she likes him or even agrees to go out with him. The show mainly serves itself as a comedy but it\u2019s certainly being out paced this season by Aho Girl, Tsurezure Children, and Gamers!\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is pretty bright kinda reminding me of oshiete galko chan but studio NAZ is only known for one other anime which is Hamatora (which was pretty damn awful but atleast was kinda nice to look at) The girls look good because that\u2019s how this show primarily plans on making money and it shows that\u2019s where a lot of the focus has gone. The animation can drag at someplaces and sometimes will look pretty bad but never unbearable. Backgrounds and other characters are extremely generic with the MC looking the plainest of all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: ahhhh the \u201cmake or break\u201d section of any romcom with a generic plot line. \\n\r\nThe characters suck. The male characters are literally carbon copies of the main cast of prison school. Like I would be willing to wager prison school creator could sue the mangaka of Hajimete no gal because the characters operate exactly like how the crew in prison school works. Getting that out of the way it\u2019s the very truth that MC\u2019s friends carry the show. The glasses guy (gakuto wannabe from Prison school) single handily owns the shows humor in terms of delivery and direction. The girls really just play the role of fap material just about every time they were on screen.\\n\r\nMC is slowly building a harem and which ofcourse includes the class president and the childhood friend, aka the two most generic female discount characters the creator could think of. \\n\r\nThere is one more character and that is Yame\u2019s Gal Friend, Ranko. \\n\r\nRanko actually looks and sounds like a gal unlike all the other girls in the show and in all honesty it would\u2019ve been more fun and interesting if she was the main character instead of Yame.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would say that it\u2019s the most average of shows airing this season by not being to awful but not having anything to make it stand out in comparison to the countless other romcoms out there. \\n\\n\r\nBut what do I know. If I don\u2019t give the show a score of 7 or higher than people will just spam my inbox and call me a hater.\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nBetween the single life and the married life, the dating life exists as its own beast.\r\nSome dates end up pretty good with more to follow soon enough. Some dates go south fast, leading to extra watch checks and a prayer or two. Some dates maybe do not go anywhere afterwards, but they leave both parties satisfied, content with the time they spent.\r\nWith the right circumstances and a bit of luck, the term \u201cstarted dating\u201d turns into \u201cmy girlfriend\u201d or \u201cmy boyfriend,\u201d indicating that that beast has been tamed. Plus, in a few short years, themarried life will take its place. Of course, trials and tribulations pop up during this phase, but he or she will have that significant other to rely on along the way.\\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal is an anime that features a couple who are girlfriend and boyfriend. That summary seems innocent enough \u2013 but be warned. This project is best broken up with before taking it out on a date in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nTo put it bluntly, Hajimete no Gal ran for ten episodes too many.\\n\\n\r\nIt makes that apparent enough with its \u201ccomedy.\u201d Quotes because calling what the show depicts as comedy does a disservice to all the funny stories out there, for it contains some of the worst comedic outings this medium has ever conceived. The timing is horrible as it tries to shift between punchlines. The delivery doesn\u2019t cut it as their dialogue falls flat. And for the love of God, just saying pedophilic statements in a nonchalant manner is not a joke. It\u2019s gross, bizarre, and plain stupid. The fact that these words even need to be typed out here speaks volumes about its so-called \u201ccomedy.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also does not spend enough time on Yukana and Junichi together alone, letting their romance rot and die instead. Indeed, not counting the first episode since they weren\u2019t a thing until the end of it, Hajimete no Gal goes out of its way to separate them when and where it can. It\u2019ll either keep them apart through an unnecessary set of semi-harem arcs (the first half of the season) or force them into a bunch of lame group activities with the girls and his close guy friends (the second half of the season).\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, the audience can almost count on one hand how many times the two hang out without anyone else around besides themselves. Such two-factor separation isn\u2019t romance; it\u2019s unwanted bologna.\\n\\n\r\nNot to forget about its ecchi moments. Which is to say that they can be forgotten given their uncreative status. No way, undressing. Surprise, surprise, boob fondling. Nobody could have guessed it, suntan lotion. One can maybe give the anime its three-way breast smooshing scene, but one semi-decent ecchi segment does not a titillating anime make.\\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal further messes up on fundamental levels, too. For example, the gyaru motif itself lacks importance. While the anime portrays Yukana and the other girls in that fashion, it is quite uncommon for this motif to mean anything significant to the events as the season progresses. The anime also foregoes Junichi\u2019s inner-monologue representations near the end of the season. An apparent oversight despite their once-an-episode-or-so inclusion beforehand, reducing the virgin premise to some extent. And the writing in general lacks the necessary emotion, nuance, and drive to make its more dramatic, down-to-Earth segments worthwhile in some form.\\n\\n\r\nIgnoring all these issues, Hajimete no Gal has very little else to offer on a story front. Not that it requires a thematic presence weaved into its narrative or a similar supplementary detail. But when it remains so weak in its comedy, romance, ecchi, and fundamental elements, the anime makes it almost impossible to see it as anything else besides a catastrophic failure.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe subpar visuals within Hajimete no Gal continue the anime\u2019s negative trend.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of its visual woes stem from basic problems. Wonky proportions for the character models decrease artistic integrity. Movement dwindles the further along the anime goes. And the background artistry lacks intrigue. In total, the show simply misses the mark when it comes to keeping the audience engaged with its presentation.\\n\\n\r\nIt attempts to push back against these problems with its ecchi roots, showcasing microphone stroking and mouth drooling, backed by pink mood lighting when the opportunity arises. However, these moments are short lived, offering only a small reprieve from the usual less-than-mediocre visuals on display. Even then, such ecchiness isn\u2019t spectacular, let alone well done, as the panning shots and the framing do not reach any interesting heights.\\n\\n\r\nAlong these lines, Hajimete no Gal offers both a censored and an uncensored version, but they each introduce their own problems, too. For the censored version, the glittery hearts are not the most fun way to hide a major component of the anime and are only tangentially related to the gyaru motif. For the uncensored version, it does not reveal too much else regardless, making it a somewhat pointless distinction between its tamer type.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are arguably the only aspect of the anime that do not take a huge hit, but they still take some hits nonetheless. At the minimum, Yukana\u2019s design gives the anime one of its first clear positives. Complementary green, pink, and white colors for her main look. Long, blonde, gradient, and wild hair, not to mention her busty assets, for more sex appeal. Different outfits and styles and accessories here and there.\\n\\n\r\nYukana\u2019s design does a lot to carry the show, and a couple of the other girls toss in their support as well. Ranko provides the tanned look, and Yui has her dichotomous school and streamer personas that oppose in depiction. Junichi and his friends aren\u2019t given as much care, but that\u2019s okay given the focus on the ladies.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Nene\u2019s initial design can only be described as horrid, tipping the ludicrous scale as far as it can go. Thankfully, she trades in her weird clothes and knotted hair for pink coloring, a star sticker, and suspenders. This new combination may seem strange, and her ridiculous proportions do not go away, but it ultimately ends up as an upgrade while following through on her character change and the gyaru motif.\\n\\n\r\nSo, yes, the artistry and the animation keep the anime in low spirits. The designs, though, prevent the presentation from being an absolute chore to sit through.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe cast members of Hajimete no Gal side with the story and the artistry, hurting the anime\u2019s execution that much more.\\n\\n\r\nJunichi does his best to do the opposite, though. As the main protagonist of this tale, he is a normal, everyday dude. Due to his low self-esteem, however, he fears that he will remain a virgin for the rest of his life. Naturally, he crosses paths with Yukana, the \u201cscary\u201d gyaru of his school, whom takes a liking to his inadvertent silliness. Thus, she decides to accept his confession.\\n\\n\r\nSaid confession also nets Junichi a ton of jealousy from the other girls that surround his newfound situation. Specifically, Ranko, Yui, and Nene swarm him, doing what they can to split him apart or take him away from his relationship with Yukana for their own personal gain. Not to mention how his three best guy friends constantly intervene with words or actions that further cause problems for the poor guy.\\n\\n\r\nThese troubles do not spell doom for Junichi. Instead, they give him the chance to not only prove his worth as a boyfriend but also demonstrate his growth as a person. He turns down advances from the other girls. He wrestles with his thoughts as opposed to making snap decisions. He works hard at protecting the bonds he shares and especially his connection with Yukana.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the ecchi elements strewn about somewhat detract from this more meaningful direction in his character. But, given Junichi\u2019s virgin motif, having a few hormonal moments and dreams aligns with his personality and Hajimete no Gal at large. At the minimum, they do not take anything away from his actions. Whether he firmly declares his faithfulness to Yukana or stands up for her goodness against a loser jerkwad, his arc from meek and defeatist to confident and thankful plays out over the entire season as one of the only other positive parts in the show.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, most of the rest of the cast do not tag along. Junichi\u2019s three friends may as well just be one friend since two of them are essentially irrelevant. The one doesn\u2019t have any discernable qualities about him, and the other is a weirdo who shouldn\u2019t be around to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nMeaning, Shinpei is his only worthwhile friend. He goes out of his way to explain situations and comes up with plans to get Junichi and Yukana together (while potentially helping him and the others out in the process). These plans often don\u2019t work out as intended, and he himself is by no means the epitome of side characters. But he at least supports his buddy which is a lot more than the other two ever do.\\n\\n\r\nIn comparison, the girls take up more screen time and have better involvement, but their construction does not equate to anything meaningful. Ranko is brutish, Yui is deceptive, and Nene is energetic, but Hajimete no Gal comprises the bulk of their characters through their own singular flashback devoid of substance.\\n\\n\r\nRanko got a flower from Yukana once. Junichi acted like a faithful dog and helped Yui with errands at some point. Nene and Junichi held hands as kids, promising about marriage conditions during a small conversation. These asides, these one-off scenes are below the bare minimum needed to give Ranko, Yui, and Nene their just due, leaving them without a fighting chance.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Yukana, she may be the worst off. Despite her girlfriend-of-the-protagonist role and clear second-in-importance status, she receives next to nothing about her character. She has nearly zero backstory let alone a solid foundation. Her motivations and thoughts are almost entirely ignored. And she hardly changes in any worthwhile way from this new experience.\\n\\n\r\nWorse still, where Junichi takes his small conflicts and learns from their hardship, Yukana encounters similar obstacles but walks around them without much hassle. For instance, the girls that vie after Junichi don\u2019t perturb her, or, even if they do, she handwaves their involvement. Moreover, when she makes that rare attempt to move outside her comfort zone, either Hajimete no Gal prevents potential progress or Yukana, by her own accord, refuses to follow through on events when pressed on the matter.\\n\\n\r\nCredit where credit is due, Yukana cherishes her romance with Junichi. She smiles for and thinks about him to cheer him up whenever she can, and she creates many of the opportunities and moments between them, such as the couple of dates they go on. So, Yukana is no doubt the nice, thoughtful gyaru who complements Junichi well. However, she remains the perfect, too-good-to-be-true girlfriend that does not get the time, attention, or care she truly deserves.\\n\\n\r\nThus, with Junichi and possibly Shinpei maintaining the only tangible semblance of worth within this anime, the cast also contribute to its continued implosion.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nAn easy guess at this point, but the audio work within Hajimete no Gal does not do much to help out either.\\n\\n\r\nIts opening track \u201cHajimete no SEASON\u201d contains no shortage of techno sounds, poppy beats, and harmonized singing. The song incorporates some dynamism through differently paced sections, but the boring vocals and the grating loudness keep what could have been a catchy tune as little more than a flag for the below-average content that will soon transpire.\\n\\n\r\nIts ending track \u201cGAL-tic Love\u201d follows a similar direction, but it ramps up those techno sounds and that grating loudness to make it even less likable of a listen. Tonally, it shifts from a slightly sad arrangement to a more uplifting one between its first and second halves, matching the OP to a degree once again. And it remains just as boring, too.\\n\\n\r\nNot to be outdone, the voice-acting performances are rather poor in execution. Especially those from Shintaro Asanuma as Junichi and Toshiyuki Toyonaga as Shinpei. The former doesn\u2019t quite nail down the nervous, funny mannerisms for someone like the main protagonist, and the latter sounds so dull despite the confidence in his lines.\\n\\n\r\nStrangely, the best performances come from the preview girls: Kazusa Aranami as Ayumi and Natsuko Hara as Kokoro. Their shrieks and their speed work well with the meta commentary they spout, putting them leagues ahead of anyone else in the cast.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the original soundtrack, it mixes together cultural influences, guitar grooves, and lighter ensembles. Unlike the OP, the ED, and the VA performances, these tracks do not hamper Hajimete no Gal and instead support its scenes through their variance. Not that they floor the listener, but they at least aren\u2019t detrimental to the experience.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing this anime, I cannot deny Yukana\u2019s coolness. She is fun, cute, and kind. A simple yet perfect combo that makes liking her as a character easy to do (or perhaps even mandatory). Plus, I like the gyaru archetype in this medium in general, and, as a huge romance fan, I rooted for her success in love the whole way through.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, she\u2019s trapped in an anime that doesn\u2019t deserve her.\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching the show, that sentiment becomes readily apparent as time goes on. I find myself annoyed or flabbergasted by over half the characters. One or two of the jokes get a smile out of me, but mostly I\u2019m shaking my head at its lameness. I\u2019m disinterested in its mundane events. I want less of the harem since it means basically nothing to me. And I cannot stop myself from pointing out its outright flaws with or without bias.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the show in full, it doesn\u2019t reach the lowest possible level in my eyes, propping itself up with a select few parts that just manage to stave off its descent. Still, it tries really hard to get there regardless.\\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal chooses the garbage heap as its destiny. Over the course of ten episodes, it gives the audience a repulsive story, a lackluster set of characters, a bludgeoned set of audiovisual elements, and a forgettable entertainment package. It\u2019s an ex that should be x\u2019d out of one\u2019s life forever.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, some of the worst \u201ccomedy\u201d ever conceived, a bologna romance angle, uncreative ecchi scenes, and fundamental troubles combine as a catastrophic failure\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Bad, waning in artistry and subpar in direction, the visuals drag along the passable character designs\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Junichi gains some self-esteem through his new relationship, and Shinpei attempts to help his buddy out, but the two other guy friends are irrelevant, Ranko, Yui, and Nene are not worthwhile, and Yukana has almost nothing going for her besides her girlfriend status\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Bad, a varied OST cannot uphold a boring OP and ED combo as well as the poor VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, Yukana deserves better\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 2/10",

            "content": "Hajimite no Gal is, overall, a very average and uninspired adaptation of the manga of the same name. It's noticeably shallower and more fast-paced than its manga counterpart. While it has an interesting premise for a comedy/ecchi anime, it's not remarkably bad or good, it's just kind of there, although it does have its enjoyable moments. \r\nFirst off, the criticisms: pacing. Although it's alright for the first episode, the story  then introduces a bunch of characters at once and juggles developing them for an episode or two. It's like they decided to pace the anime almost perfectly for one episode, then thought \"Oh crap,we have to make this fit 10 episodes\". The manga is slower paced and therefore there is a bit more character development especially between Yukana and Junichi, so if you have been enjoying the anime, I would recommend you read it as you will likely enjoy it more.\\n\\n\r\nAlso related to pacing, the omission or flipping around of certain events which would otherwise be important to the relationship between characters creates some confusion, and shallowness even. Parts of the story that could have enhanced the plot are removed because an arc is crammed into one episode that would span several chapters in the manga, and the story suffers because of it. There simply isn't enough time for the viewer to become invested. I didn't feel like the show created much room for the viewer to be really empathetic towards the characters. Most of the supporting cast is kind of one-dimensional. Certain characters such as the Junichi's friends exist almost solely for comic relief and don't really show much development.\\n\\n\r\nThe meh: the sound and art are not anything to write home about. The voice acting fit the characters well enough. Sometimes I wondered why a particular thing was happening or what the point of a certain scene was. The female lead Yukana's personality occasionally goes from succubus supreme to a pure lass in a matter of seconds for very odd reasons. It has a fair bit of ecchi scenes which can be a bit over the top given the situation the protagonist finds himself in, though most of them are just humourous and don't go too far.\\n\\n\r\nThe positives: it's often pretty funny and enjoyable, and even interesting at times. The show has a nice atmosphere to it, and the anime is faithful to character's personalities despite hurrying and warping the plot. The premise of the show is actually interesting despite its sloppy execution.\\n\\n\r\nExtra: if they slowed the anime down I'm sure this would be much more enjoyable, or if they went for 24 episodes instead, but it seems as though they decided nobody would want to watch that. And there definitely IS a lot they could have put in to make the story stick more and the characters to feel more fleshed out. \\n\\n\r\nIn summary, the anime isn't anything remarkable, but if you just want some laughs and look at some mild to moderate ecchi, then you may get a kick out of this. It tries to act serious as the manga sometimes but it falls flat as otherwise tense situations are diffused in a heartbeat instead of letting things take their time. As anime by itself, it's quite average, though it is poor as an adaptation of the manga of the same name.",

            "content": "Story: I'll start by saying this - This is pretty good. The abundance of fan service was KIND OF A TURN OFF for me, but at it dwindles down about after the first few episodes. What sucks about this anime is that it's only 10 episodes, and because it actually has a pretty damn good author, it could have gone for a lot longer. \r\nI mean... The plot, the characters, the direction the writer was able to take the story... This easily could have been a 20+ episode series (on that note, really hope there's a season 2...)\r\nJust saying, it had a lot of potentialsto be far greater than what it was.\\n\\n\r\nArt: As for art... Nothing special. Some parts are pretty lazy, but that's okay. Honestly, if it wasn't for how cute the main female protagonist is at times, I probably would have scored the art lower. And Nene's tits are just way too fucking BIG! WTF!!!\\n\\n\r\nSound: There are some pretty funny music and stuff played at the right times, and Shinpei's voice is just awesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Speaking of which... The characters. A good reason why this anime had so much potential is due to the variety of characters. All of the female characters are great - especially Yume and the black haired Tsundere girl. But for me, the character that really stands out here is Shinpei... And he's just one of the MC's friends. Oh... The big guy though. He's a bit too full on with his fetish.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: I laughed a lot, but cringed a lot too... Mostly in a good kind of way though. So, this was good. The reason I wanna give it a \"Very Good\" though is because I recognize how much better it could have been. Oh well.",

            "content": "So I saw there was quite a lot of negative reviews about this anime so I decided tow rite my own review so men of culture such as myself will not be frighthened by the reviews. Contains minor spoilers.\r\nSo the Mc is a pathetic sort of characther that has many fantasties like all young male do about losing his virginity. It is basicully one of those anime where a pathetic guy gets a hot girl that is way of his league. So it starts of with him begging this girl to become his girlfriend and she accepts. The whole story is basicully a slice oflife with Mc having erotic fantasties about his girl friend and his friends being jealous of him with his side hoes getting in the way.\\n\\n\r\nSo characters lets start of with the Mc and herorin, Mc is pathetic and has erotic fantasies nothing more to say. His girlfriend the main girl is a blonde gal who teases him and has some nice things between her chest(Insert lenny face). \\n\\n\r\nNext are his side hoes, can\u2019t be a harem anime without some side hoes, first is a tanned gyaru who is childhood friend to Mc\u2019s girlfriend and is in love with her. She also has a nice chest. Next is the Mc\u2019s childhood friend(can never be a harem without the childhood friend)she is in love with the Mc and has changed her appearence due to what the Mc said a few years ago, she also has a nice chest. Finally its the cold student council preisdent with the black hair. Sadly this one is the odd one out and doesn\u2019t have big boobs so something for those small boob fans.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally are the friends, like all anime similar to this he has friends that are jealous. He has 3 friends one that wears glasses and is the mastermind that always gives our help less Mc s***** dating advice. Then there is the rather round one who is a lolicon, not much to say about him(just keep him away from the kids is all I say). Then there is the 3rd one as 2 is not enough, I find him pretty pointless if I\u2019m honest.\\n\\n\r\nI rated this 8 as I quite enjoyed it, it served its purpose of giving me a laugh from time to time and gracing me with some nice fan service. Nothing really much to say so if you like hot girls and a pathetic Mc that gets a girl way out of his league probably your cup of tea\\n\\n",

In one of his videos I saw the changes made for western audiences, and couldn't help but chuckle. I recommend this series dub, because of the funny lines said through out the series, and the way thevoice actors portray the character.

            "content": "I was completely blown away by this series. I will wholeheartedly admit that I was drawn in by the sweet, sweet oppai, and as such, I wasn't expecting anything aside from glorious eye candy. Wow, was I foolish.\r\nI was expecting a shallow show with even shallower characters purely designed for nothing more than sex appeal (not every show is a masterpiece, nor even tries to be). I made judgements about it before I ever watched it, and this is actually a recurring theme throughout Hajimete no Gal. If you can sit through the objectively poor first episode, it'll pay off in spades.\r\nThe cast is fullof (mostly) enjoyable characters, overflowing with depth you'd never think possible from a show with such an ecchi thumbnail. Almost everyone undergoes some form of REALISTIC character growth. Aside from Nene Fujinoki, everyone has at least one moment where they get to be the best version of themselves. Even the deeply disturbing pedophile Minoru gets his time to shine. Almost all of these moments exhibit that people are rarely as shallow as your first impression of them. If there's one thing that you should take away from this anime, it's that \"don't judge a book by its cover\" isn't just some tired clich\u00e9. Nearly everyone in this show has a complexity to them not found in many other ecchi comedies. Everyone from Yame herself to the desperate (yet deeply, deeply enjoyable) creep Shinpei is more than they first appear. Yame appears in the first episode with very ill-fitting clothes, and acts like a stereotypical \"gyaru/gal,\" who have a connotation of being very sexually promiscuous. Whether it's for attention, or they just know what they want, it's a style of dress often associated with sexuality in a negative way. This couldn't be further from Yame's personality. She's fairly modest. Not in the way she dresses, mind you, but her personality and attitude towards relationships.\\n\r\nShinpei immediately comes across as a desperate creep, and that isn't untrue of him, but he's just shameless, not a villain. He isn't afraid of what people think, and he can actually be very considerate and intelligent when he wants to. In serious situations, he's surprisingly quite the gentleman.\\n\r\nRanko, Yame's friend, has her own reasons for being around Yame, and despite coming across as a flirt, she's a very protective and loyal individual. She tests Junichi's motivations in her own way, and, without giving much away, she uses her sexuality not as a crutch for the show to lean on, but as a vehicle to have a mature, meaningful dialogue about a topic that the show itself even introduced as juvenile. She does a lot for the show in all three of its main corners: comedy, ecchi, and a genuinely emotional plot. In my opinion, no one showcases the pillars of the show more than Ranko.\\n\r\nEven Boa makes enormous strides as a person, but you'll have to watch it yourself for anything spoiler-free there.\\n\\n\r\nThis is, without a doubt, the most well done non-fiction setting I've ever seen in an anime. It's by no means the best thing ever, but it does so well in every category that it's truly something special, and it does it in a mere ten episodes. It's the first time I've ever seen so much done with so little.\\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal was a massively enjoyable trip when I wasn't even expecting one. I was lured in by the spectacular boobage, but found myself not even thinking about the ecchi aspect by the end. It was a surprisingly emotional ride, and it caused me to take stock of myself. I like to consider myself an open-minded person, but I was judging the show like so many of the characters were being judged. Even though there're times when you'll find yourself shaking your head at them, these deep characters have plenty to offer both the plot and \"plot.\"",

            "content": "This show is heavily slammed by hate, yet it's understandable. Hajimete no Gal is one of those anime that you either highly enjoyed or you hated it deeply. Most of the hate comes from the fact that the show is a generic ecchi with fan-service to sell copies and yes, apart of this statement is true. BUT, Hajimete no Gal happens to be one of the most comedic anime i've ever seen, and i'm here to explain why.\r\nSTORY\r\nThe story is revolved around the MC (Junichi) and his pervert friends (Shinpei, Minoru and Keigo) that pretty much everyone dislikes due to the fact that they're well...perverts. Miraculously, Junichi obtains a girlfriend (Yukana) who happens to enjoy Junichi's company and accepts him. Now even though the anime is a very fan-service induced anime. The DUB however is the real selling point of the anime, if you're not watching the dub you're automatically missing out on some of the most hilarious anime moments. This is one of the main reasons why I WOULD recommend this anime.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art style of this anime is very typical of a new-style moe, ecchi anime. While not terrible,  it doesn't excel either.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe DUB cast is so on point with this anime that it's hilarious, I actually think that the cast was conscious of how bad the anime was on it's own, so they took it up a notch and made it great again. The opening and ending songs were a good choice of music and the OST is pretty average. \\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal is if not one of the most hilarious anime i've ever watched to this date. It provides us with a pretty bland cute story with lot's of fanservice while making us laugh the whole way through. I would highly recommend this anime just for the laughs :>",

            "content": "This anime is hated by a lot of people, and I see the reason why. Hajimete no Gal tackles on a story about a virgin who wants to get laid, and by that, you already know what'll really happen in this anime. The anime is hated because its quite dreadful, shameful, and its just plain bad. But, that statement goes for the story. It's extremely predictable but it tries its best to keep us entertained. It doesn't really get us bored, it just makes us question what we're watching and even with that we're still gonna finish this anime.\r\nSTORY [4/10]\r\n- The story is shameful, yes.The guy just wants to get laid so he confesses to this gal, and its just retarded that the gal agrees to go out with the guy even though she knows that he just wants to get laid by her. But, their relationship develops (as you would expect) and everything else is predictable. Its weird that all the girls except the best friend of Yame-san has romantic feelings for the main character but it makes a bit of sense because it is shown to us why. Even with that, his harem isn't really well-deserved and he's just stuck to a shitfest where he cant be tempted to fuck any of them because as the anime goes along, he gains extreme feelings for Yame-san which makes him a loyal virgin who still has no balls.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt [6/10]\\n\r\n-Its not bad. Its how anime art normally is, in my opinion. And, in all honesty, the girls are cute with their looks. I mean, Yame-san is so fucking cute holy shit what the fuck.\\n\\n\r\nSound [4/10]\\n\r\n- It doesn't really have the type of music you would want to hear but it also isn't the type of music that would make you want to stop listening. The sound in this anime is okay, its not horrible, its decent. Its not annoying to a point where you'd stop watching because of the music, its just not the sounds you would go crazy on.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [10/10]\\n\r\n- The premise of the whole anime is retarded and shameful which already guarantees that you don't give this anime a high rating but its characters are amazingly lovable, in my opinion. Not one of them are annoying as shit. You cant really hate any of the characters with all the shit they put up on. And, they're all pretty entertaining. They all have pretty good character development which makes us know who they truly are and thats what makes them great because we really get to know them and they all put up a likable influence that makes us be fond of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [7/10]\\n\r\n- Its shameful as I have said for the millionth time BUT you'll have some pretty great laughs. Its enjoyable, I gotta say. It makes you laugh a lot (I mean, it made me laugh a lot). But, in this anime, the comedy is something we'll all see coming. Its about a virgin confessing to a gal and he has his virgin friends helping him out, and the main character's friends make it funnier with their relationship advices which always connect to sex. So, its funny if you're perverted.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [5/10]\\n\r\n- The anime isn't as bad as you think it is, its just not good. You'll have some great laughs but you can never seriously take the story and the premise of the anime itself so if you put everything up, even if all the characters are pretty damn likable, its still gonna result to a mediocre anime.",

            "content": "Is Hajimete no Gal a masterpiece? The answer is no. Is it as bad as a lot of people think? The answer is again no. After watching it I found it peculiar that so many people have such a low opinion of this series. I can understand the frustration to a certain degree but the bashing received by the series is a bit overkill. I get it. It is not original, deep, with an interesting universe or complex characters but does that make it not enjoyable? I personally disagree. I found the entire series very enjoyable. Think of it as a funny break from otherseries. You don\u2019t need to be heavily invested you just need to chill and laugh at the slapstick humor.\\n\r\nThe story is not particularly strong but so what. It\u2019s about a high school kid trying to get laid. I mean who has not been in a similar position? It\u2019s awkward, frustrating and ultimately funny. The struggle, at times is hilarious. And to a certain degree it develops into an actual love story given that emotions develop and lust becomes love. Yes I get the fact that most of are used to seeing awesome characters getting involved in extremely weird situations with the opposite sex but in my opinion this series is a bit more realistic. Yes it is filled with weird, out of this world, situations but it is also filled with situations that are more realistic, primarily the interaction of hormonal teenagers with no real knowledge of romantic relationships.\\n\r\nAs for the art one can only say that the creator is actually responsible for some hentai (at least that\u2019s what I heard). Based on that I think one can imagine what the show is all about in regards to art. It is a fan service paradise. Panty and boob shots are the bread and butter for this series. Overall it fits quite nicely given that the main character is a hormonal teenager and it gives rise to several sexually fueled situation.\\n\r\nSound is Ok I guess. There is nothing too bad or too exciting. It is just average.\\n\r\nCharacters were also ok. Given time these characters could have developed into something exceptional (except the possible child molester). Unfortunately there was not much time so their development is skin deep but the basis for them is pretty good. It clearly explores the angst of teenagers in very different ways and though it is plagued with clich\u00e9s it also tries to differ from other archetypes projecting the mess that is often linked with teenagers.\\n\r\nAs I have said already the series is not the re-invention of the wheel but it is very enjoyable. I laughed in several occasions and when it came to an end I felt that I had a good time and that I did not waste my time. Of course there better series out there but in no way is this one as bad as it is portrayed to be.\\n\r\nI recommend it if you just want to kill a couple of hours with a very light and funny series that does try to be something more than it actually is.\\n",

            "content": "I'm here to give an un-biased positive review on this anime and by un-biased I mean full disclosure not based on the ecchi parts but what actually occured on the anime.\r\nI'll be honest, I chose to watch this anime instead of another anime last-minute as a \"come back to anime\" of sorts. I was expecting this to be like a light-hearted, ecchi anime because it was night and I wanted to watch anime again.\r\n/*   Foreword   */\r\nI did kind of get what I want but the story actually made me want less of it as the story progressed and less it did.People who gave the lowest reviews are slamming the anime mostly for the \"bland plot\" and the \"cliche tits for views\" but I think that's based on what's seen from the surface. Sometimes you just got to dig deep to find the good behind a plot. That or I could be digging too much into this. I don't know for sure but I'm pretty sure that what I dug was actually intended to be there as part of the plot.\\n\\n\r\n/*   Full Disclosure   */\\n\r\nThe anime in a nutshell as to what you can see, a group of single male perverts in highschool forced one of them to confess to a gal trying to break the repeated system of being single every year and staying a virgin. He does confess and to his surprise they started dating. With perverseness on his mind and the will to lose his virginity, stuff goes on from that point as their relationship progresses yada-yada and then there's your ecchi scenes every now and then.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing is most of the reviews just end there albeit being much longer and more drawn out than it needs to be. As I was watching this anime, the characters developed in a way you don't usually see anime characters develop. The extremely perverted group of friends eventually start to mature near the end of the anime. The gal and the guy started understanding how a relationship works including the bitterness and sweetness of it. And the overall plot develops as well. I don't know if other people noticed but as the story progressed and as the characters slowly started to mature, ecchi scenes started to dwindle as \"true love\" started to replace infatuation. By the last episode there were none if my memory serves me right because at that point the once perverted MC has grown out of his perverse shell and matured into a person who cared for the person he love the most, even sacrificing the attempts of his friends to make him carry out perverse acts. The thing why most people don't see this I think is because the context is brought about in such a light-hearted manner.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite thing probably about this anime is it's not your typical harem anime where every girl seems to have a chance at the main character and the anime drags it on and on until the season ends and no real answer is given, only cliffhangers. To be honest, those anime have really high ratings despite what most refuse to accept is that it's mostly fillers with no real relation to the story except to fuel the fandoms. The story on this anime however, you can connect nearly every scene to the progression of the plot and the development of the characters, not some random events that just happen to look like plot but is just fanservice in reality. This anime finishes the story. This anime made it clear who wins. This anime despite being a harem anime has a set of harem characters who are actually likeable and not being fought as the \"best girl\" because they could possibly be the one. In the end, the other girls here eventually supported who won despite having feelings for the MC. And all of this slowly grew in the anime, you just had to sift it through the light-heartedness of the way it was portrayed.\\n\\n\r\n/*   Final Notes   */\\n\r\nTo end this rant, I would like to say that reviews are just reviews. Other reviews are just their opinions. My reviews are my opinions. If the anime caught your eye in a positive manner even if it usually isnt you're flavor of anime, watch it. Don't take reviews completely as \"the ultimate verdict\". Despite the reviews, you might actually like it or hate it. Only you can tell because your opinions and the way your brain decides to like things is unique. You might see positivite reviews but end up hating it. You might see negative reviews and miss out on an anime that you would enjoy greatly. Or not. That is for you to decide before, during and after watching. Reviews are meant to give an idea, not a definitive, but a constructive idea.",

            "content": "I never thought I would see a show that sort of makes fun of this notion of millennials and their \"legacy\"in history. It may be unintentional but nonetheless it is kinda entertaining.And by the show, I mean the dub, Funimation has really outdone themselves\r\nHajimete no Gal(My First Girlfriend is a Gal) is a show--I can say that. This show is about a guy who wants a girlfriend and after he gets one, other girls start to get jealous and try to tempt him to cheat on his\"gal\"-hence the title-also his friends are trying to make him do stupid stuff.The actual story is linear butstill not that progressive.There is the part where they hook up and then he meets the other girls and finally the end where he tries to fight some bad guy that was never mentioned before his introduction.Like every other rom-com. But the one thing that makes this dub redeemable is the english dub. The dub itself changes so much from the characters to the actual genre of the show. It's supposed to be a rom-com, but actually it is a raunchy comedy with an awkward moment in the end.It is almost Ghost Stories levels of innovation.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in the show is interesting. The character designs make all the girls interesting .Especially with Yukana,the main \"gal\" of the series.The way she dresses is more feminine than the regular highschool girl.Just look as the other older series \"Super Gals\" for reference. Not to be a pig, but she is very hot. I like the distinct lips and the hair. The same goes with the other female characters accept the little girl,Nene who just looks like little girl with balloons strapped to her chest. The animation subpar. The only time the animation is fluid is during the lewd scene. I also like the use of censorship in the show. There is overlay of jewelry hearts to cover the good bits also during the hot scenes there is this background of gal products and the hands of other people are covering the girls it is very nice way to censor things instead of putting stupid black holes around the people.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOkay, this is the best part of the show by far, the sound. From the foley,to the OST,and the freaking dub. It is something magical.The Dub is one of those funimation dubs that the voice actors/actresses have fun with.The dub is Panty and Stocking levels of lewd(despite the fact they tried to censor it with bleeps) and the different ranges of expressions on the characters.This is the case with the main character's friend with glasses,His voice actor was one of the best. He does different expressions like Yoda for example. Also the voice actresses did a good job with the \"gal\" slang. I feel like a \"gal\" would be no different than a millennial high school kid so there was a lot of slang terms that was a bit funny but that is only a portion of the hilariousness. There are a lot of clever jokes in this show from crude ones like the log flume one in the first episode that had me rolling ,to the ones that make fun of the actual show itself.The one that had me gut laughing was in one of the final episodes where in a very conflicting moment one of the girls asks for a sandwich. That one got me. Also the voice actresses did their part well too, the main actress had herself a fun time and I can't remember her being like that since Panty and Stocking.Speaking of Panty and Stocking, the soundtrack itself has some similarities to it. There are three different portions of the tracks.Some of the tracks sound like something you would hear on Nick Jr. Other tracks sound like they were made by some synthetic orchestra, and the rest is full of intense and interesting techno music. The techno part is my favorite. They are best to hear when something lewd happens.One track similar to PSG uses sounds from an actual female having sex in the song and it was combined with a lot of pop and i LOVE IT.The OP and ED are techno as well but they are the JPOP types of tracks that are alright if you just listen to it instrumentally.Also there are the sounds used for humor like twangs and sparkles(Im not good with onomatopoeias )\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are just regular people except the main gal, Yukana, she was the most interesting . The main protagonist male however was not my favorite. He is one of those shy coward characters who is very awkward.He also has four other inner characters, so its kinda like the cowboy guy in Tatami Galaxy but worse.There is the other gals. (my least favorite is the popular girl) and the perverted friends who were just perverts. There was one character who really made my stomach kinda turn and thats the big guy Minoru. The running gag in the show is that he has a liking towards younger girls but the show and the dub exponentially makes him look like a straight up pedophile. I really have to praise the scriptwriter for the dub for giving him some of the most creepiest pedophile jokes ever.I appreciate what the OG creators were going trying to make a character who is into little kids but thats still insanely creepy.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it this way, Hagimete no Gal is not the worst show ever.........if you watch the dub. I am pretty sure that if Funimation decided not to license the show it would be a complete afterthought. But I have to say this is one of the funniest dubs that Funimation has ever done and it has made the show way more entertaining, but sadly the other parts of the show really don't cut it and balance out how good the show overall is.\\n\r\nOverall-6\\n\r\nPlease watch the dub, it is really worth it.\\n\\n\\n",

The only good is the art, that's it!!!! \r\nSo stay away from this anime if you don't wanna waste your time. It has the worst anime couple I've ever seen.

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nUsually anime's like this to me are a mixed bag, some can be good and some can be bad, this one is just about in the middle, but by God was it a cringefest to get through.\r\nStory (5/10)\r\nThe story centres around Junichi Hashiba, who desperately wants a girlfriend so he can lose his virginity, his friends decide to force him into asking out a gal known as Yukana Yame, surprisingly to Junichi's expectations she accepts his offer.\r\nNow if you're looking for an amazing romance story, don't bother that isn't here, the way the story goes and it's pacing is very cliched, for exampleyou have the beach, hot spring, karaoke and even the party game episode's and remember this series only has 10 eps.\\n\r\nThe first half of the show is definitely the more cringy to watch, we get introduced to the main characters over the course of the first 5 episodes, which turns the show into more of a harem than a romance, but it's just how some of these problems are dealt with and the most stupid was how Junichi dealt with Nene, it wasn't the outcome that annoyed me it was more the situation they were in.\\n\r\nThe second half of the show does try to at least redeem itself, it had the group of characters do the cliched episodes as usual, but they had their moments and the show was slowly getting better and funnier, plus it was even trying to make an effort to concentrate on Junichi and Yukana, then the final episodes came along and it just fell down again as we get introduced to the cliche final boss where the MC overcomes his struggle and everyone gets a happy ending.\\n\r\nI will give the show some credit, because it actually had Junichi and Yukana kiss in the final episode whereas most anime's leave the viewers hanging, mainly so they can milk out another season hopefully that won't be the case here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were a huge mixed bag for me, because some of the characters were likeable it's just that most were either meh or really forgettable.\\n\r\nJunichi and Yukana are the main characters of the series, between the two of them Junichi was the more likeable mainly because he was very relatable with his awkward, uncomfortable and overthinking personality, this did remind me a bit of myself, but he has a pretty freaky perv side which is where the similarities end, I did like how he had a constant battle with his personalities over the series and it did reflect how his character was feeling, these personalities are shown less and less throughout the show which shows that Junichi was becoming a more confident and open person.\\n\r\nYukana on the other hand wasn't as impressive, although despite being more funny and sweet than I was expecting, she didn't have a big impact on me other than having a sweet body which isn't always enough for me to get interested into a character.\\n\r\nNene Fujinoki is Junichi's friend since childhood, despite being the childhood character who doesn't get any love from the MC and having a very disproportional body type, she was actually the most interesting female character of the series which is kinda funny since I started out thinking she was the most pointless character, her sweet nature and funny attempts at being a gal to make Junichi interested in her eventually won me over.\\n\r\nYui Kashii is in some cases the Tsundere of the group, however she also has a bit of a God-complex going since she see's everyone as her servants, she also develops a crush on Junichi because he would do anything for her until he got into a relationship with Yukana, this made her feel like she had lost something and it made her despise Yukana although she does slowly warm up to Yukana who actually doesn't hate and thinks she's an actual friend. \\n\r\nRanko Honjou is Yukana's best friend, probably the most forgettable female character alongside Yukana she is pretty much the knuckle head of the group, she hates Junichi because she also has feelings for Yukana and makes Junichi's life a living hell, she does help him from time to time however this is mainly for Yukana's benefit, other than that she really doesn't do much else.\\n\r\nThen you have Junichi's group of friends, it consists of Shinpei, Keigo and Minoru. These are definitely the usual pervy characters, but in some way they can be funny except Minoru he's downright creepy since he is only interested in little girls, however if you hurt a little girl in front of him, he will literally turn into the Hulk and destroy his target. All these guys offer is comedy and it's not the best which makes them pretty pointless.\\n\\n\r\nArt (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow the artstyle wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either, it honestly felt like you're normal run of the mill harem anime, that being said the character designs especially the female characters were quite elaborate, it's like the animators looked at High School DxD and thought we need that, but instead of the tallest female character having the biggest oppai they gave it to the Loli instead which is why Nene put me off at first.\\n\r\nOther than the character designs there wasn't much else to talk about for the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nStrangely the best part of the show is the op and ed, for a show like this they were actually better than I expected, they were unexpectedly pumped up like you would get a weird feeling of wanting to join in with the music.\\n\r\nSoundtrack wise I didn't really take note of, mainly because I was distracted by the shows cringe levels.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nSince this anime has Romance you'd think they'd do a better job, but no instead we get a pretty cliched show that almost turns into a harem, I actually couldn't get into the relationship between Junichi and Yukana, sure they had their moments, but there wasn't enough of these moments it was really just a group of characters messing around trying to get rid of their virginity.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in this show was definitely one of the most cringy stuff I have seen since Eromanga Sensei, considering I was watching it in the dub too it felt so painful listening to the gal characters yet somehow when Nene tried to be a gal it didn't feel cringy, the jokes oh the jokes they are horrible it's like Funimation looked at the freshest memes and piled them into the show which made me glad this show was only 10 episodes, the comedy pretty much ruined the show for me.\\n\\n\r\nFinally there is the Ecchi/fanservice, not as bad as I was expecting considering bare nipples aren't shown, however literally the first second of the show is a shot of panties and at that point I knew what I was in for, the jiggle physics just reminded me of High School DxD although not as heavy, yet the most surprising and unsurprising part is Nene, with her character I was just expecting dumb jiggly breasts yet instead she actually goes the most far even getting bare nude when Junichi is sleeping and getting the first prize for most revealing swimsuit, so yeah there were some surprises I weren't expecting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was just another Ecchi/fanservice type anime, it tries to do what some other shows I've seen like this do, but it just didn't work, if it had just concentrated more on Junichi and Yukana then it might not have been too bad, hopefully there isn't a second season of this because they kissed and in my book that's all I need.",

            "content": "So, where did it start to review this anime? I also don\u2019t know. After all, I\u2019m also a bit lazy to review it. But, how else. This anime is a bit mediocre if I think. Or maybe, it\u2019s just my mind at all or whatever is that? Hajimete no Gal manga made by Meguru Ueno which is still running. Published in 2015, its manga is also able to make its readers interested by this manga. Before it, I also had no intention to read the manga. However, when summer started in 2017, it\u2019s have started out an announcement that the anime will be out. So,I\u2019m going to review the anime.\\n\\n\r\nPeople will criticize this anime by saying, \u201cYeah, dude. That\u2019s a huge tit I\u2019ve ever seen in my entire life.\u201d or \u201cYeah, so much fanservice.\u201d That\u2019s all the words of the person who made this first impression anime. And I\u2019m also one of those people who say that. But, I like the harem elements that exist in this anime because this anime also doesn\u2019t look like any other traditional harem anime. For example how Junichi dating just to eliminate her virginity, a gal who also apparently wanted a love like a normal person, to Junichi\u2019s friend who is a pedophile in excess of good ways. There are also many interesting things that can be watched in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal is like eating a meal that has not been eaten for a long time. The point is, it is broken but there is no more food that can not be eaten. Although many people say that this anime and so, they also keep watching it even though some don\u2019t think like that. The heroine in this anime also has very interesting personality. For example, Yukana, although a gal still has feelings in his heart, Ranko can be said to be a description of a somewhat lesbian, Nene who her boobs that don\u2019t make sense but his love to Junichi is bigger than the existing heroine, and Yui is always assuming her friends are a servant who serves her even though he also has feelings towards Junichi.\\n\\n\r\nWith some regrets too, I was a bit disappointed with this anime. Not with the problem of the story or the fanservice that exist, but this Junichi character who looks somewhat annoying. Junichi is the luckiest person in his life, surrounded by 4 heroines, but just the same kind of harem anime stereotype. Junichi is just a coward, weak, stupid, and not very understanding what love is. In essence, Junichi is just like the image of the other anime character harem though not all also like that. In addition, Junichi can also look cool in some of his episodes. Mediocre bro, mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork anime is pretty good for anime that aired in this season. And for the soundtrack, I don\u2019t really have a good impression for the ending and opening there. Although some people think that the music is also slightly memorable, I don\u2019t think that way. In essence, the music is just as good for the size of anime harem.\\n\\n\r\nI would consider this anime mediocre because there are some elements as well that make this anime look good for me myself. That\u2019s why I\u2019m also interested in reading the manga after watching this anime. Indeed anime like this is not my favorite genre but this anime is quite interesting to watch even though there are some disappointments in it.",

I was planning on not seeing it when it started to aired, but I gave it a chance. Sometimes i regret giving it a chance and sometimes I don\u2019t regret it. I personally enjoy this series, but not to the extent to saying that it was memorable or anything surprising. There were a lot of things that I personally hate it, a lot, and some things that I like. \r\n[ART & ANIMATION]\r\nWell, first of let's start talking about the art used in Hajimeteno Gal, and boy I have a lot of things to say about it.  First I have to say that I personally hate the art, most of the time I felt that I was watching a hentai because of the bad quality it had. The characters design look weird and focus only on fan service. The animation at times doesn't seem smooth  and it seems it skips some frames.  (4/10)\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND]\\n\\n\r\nThe work of the voice actors wasn\u2019t that bad, but I personally didn\u2019t enjoy some of the voices, I found them weird or annoying. //va enjoy some of them, sometimes the music used were weird. The songs used during the anime were kind of good, but there was one that seemed weird and didn\u2019t fit any mood that the anime wanted to transmit.  (5/10)\\n\\n\r\n[STORY] \\n\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, I actually enjoy the story. If you skip the parts that include fan service (like 7 episodes or so) The story is actually pretty interesting and very cute. It has a lot of clich\u00e9s, but it actually helps see the growth of the characters and their relationship. There were a lot of characters I didn\u2019t like, but the way the anime tells the story between the main character\u2019s friends and his relationship with the heroin. Overall the story is pretty cute and unique by developing a romance with a Gal. (7/10)\\n\\n\r\n[CONCLUSION] \\n\\n\r\nI cannot say that I enjoy this anime, it\u2019s pretty cute but the art style is really bad and not proportionally correct. I recommend to watch this anime if you like romance comedy, but have patient with the art style. The anime isn\u2019t that great but it\u2019s nice just to pass the time. (5/10)\\n",

If you go back and watch the show in English Dub, you will agree with me that what they accomplished was nothing less than a masterpiece.  Basically you end up with something along the lines of the comedy and ad-libbing that that free form voice acting like Ghost Stories or really good abridged series produce.\r\nTo be fair, the story isn't really that great, the art is better than average but I do like the variety in the character's appearance.  Althoughthey did go super overboard on Loli-Big-Boobs.  But the English Dub, which I consider sound, makes the characters and enjoyment level go through the roof.  Because of this, I write the average story and non spectacular art off as casualties of war.  So I do hereby grant the English Dub a 10/10 overall and hail it as a masterclass in terms of what all comedy Dubs should aim for.  Check it out and you will surely be laughing out loud as I was.",

Back to the topic in hand , the character , Junich ends up in a relationship with the said gal who isn't what a lot think she is, in other words, she a bitch but not \"A\" bitch, instead she is bitchy girl who dresses like a bitch but not a bitch in fact the real bitch is Ranko, she only looks like that cu'z of her association with the latter. In the end the story did relate to such reality that such thing dose exist in real life like a bad boy being with a conservative girl or girl in a rocking body being with a fat slob, where true love exist with opposites.\\n\\n\r\nArt, Mediocre 5\\n\\n\r\nWhat do you expect in an anime with an ecchi genre????? Shinpantsu, Big asses, big boobs , hot couture , in this case the usual loli in Nene, Zettai Ryoki in Yui, Bokuko in Ranko, blondie in Yame, don't forget the usual red head in Nene and all sorts of eye candy that thsoe who can't get enough would enjoy.........\\n\\n\r\nSound, Good 7\\n\\n\r\nThe score is for them opening theme which is \"Our First Season\"\\n\\n\r\nLike - I like your free sprit \\n\r\nBut I feel a bit lonely if I am left alone\\n\\n\r\nLove - I may have cut my hair too much\\n\r\n\"Yeah, you really did\" is not a right response. Shouldn't you say \"but you look cute\" instead?\\n\\n\r\nI want to keep my eyes closed gently and find with my fingertips \\n\r\nLike a key and a keyhole \\n\r\nYes, leave the next take up to me\\n\r\nI am going to be a producer for summer\\n\r\nJust for two of us\\n\\n\r\nYou're the first one (Yeah!)\\n\r\nIt's finally here, a dazzling SEASON \\n\r\nHot sun (Yeah!) \\n\r\nFeeling love\\n\r\nLet's make it more exciting\\n\r\nMy answer is \"YES\" (Yeah!) \\n\r\nBut I don't want you to think it's too easy\\n\r\nThe first time (The first time) \\n\r\nOnly comes once\\n\r\nCherish it, To You\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, Poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nEven if everything has to do with Junichi and Yame, being in a relationship, I simply just can't help as to how Junichi has to be this guy who has to be such a klutz when it come to getting into a relationship, where he doesn't know the ones around him that already like him like Nene and Yui, whom he can bang provide that he only has to ask them , instead he has to be this sucker that his so called friends, Shinpie, Keigo, and the fatty lolicon Minoru who has to set him up with a loose girl like Yame, in fact he flip flop from being this sweet guy that Yame would like to someone who just wanna get some banging. Yame on the other hand was this stereotypical gal who isn't a gal in attitude, in fact her role is an oxymoron, where she can be perceive as a bitch when in fact she isn't, she only like that due to her friendship with Ranko, whom she has no idea that she is a lesbian.......or not, in fact their friendship, seems to be ambiguous, cu'z thought they maybe friends, Yame maybe a guarded kind of person, but seeing them act like that they're having sex was too uncalled for cu'z kinda contradicts as to what Yame is. Now on to Ranko, ok so she a bitch in fact she is a bitch's bitch where she can have sex with any of those 3 stooges, Shinpie , Keigo and Minoru if she wants to and have some with Yui, Nene and her besty Yame as, well, as a bokuko, she did played her role well, too well in fact that she can beat a bunch of delinquents without a scratch and can be this dominatrix that one should not cross. Now the 3 stooges, Shinpie, Keigo and Minoru, they typically play the role of the ff: Shinpei Sakamoto basically can pass as a sex offender,  Keigo Ishida a delinquent who doesn't know how to be one and Minoru, if Shinpie can pass as a sex offender, he is a potential one.  Ayumi Kamisaka and  Kokoro Sh\u012bna too bad they were never given any major role, they can at least add to the MC already complicated harem, too bad writer  Meguru Ueno never intended to add them to it. anyways, regardless of which it just all about them girls as the eye candy.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, Poor 3\\n\\n\r\nFrankly i just don't see any reason for the censorship, when in fact the shinpantsu and Nene's naked glory wasn't much of anything,  when I view it from another site where their is no censorship the fanservce there weren't titillating, you won't see any of Nene's nipples in her naked scene nor one would see any of them girls half naked at all for the most part. So basically the censored version was just a waste of time and whatever morality that is left there \\n\\n\r\nOverall, fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nI give such score since it was nice of studio NAZ, to just limit it to 10, either way , this anime still sucks.\\n\\n\r\nOUT!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "[English]\r\nFirstly: I do not understand how some people can hate this anime so much, I understand the exaggerated ecchi and the fan sevice scrotum, but I do not think they are reasons to detonate the work so much.\r\nHajimete no Gal tells the story of 15-year-old Junichi Hashiba, a young virgin who is persuaded by friends - equally virgins - to call a gal in dating. This gal is Yukana Yame, the other protagonist, who sees Junichi begging to date her and decides to accept and the two begin to get together. At first the story seems bad (and if it is to see well itis), but the unfolding of the story is good and interesting, the fact that the friends of the protagonist liked it is a good detail and a good addition to the fluidity of the work.\\n\\n\r\nNote: Gal would be a kind of \"bitch\".\\n\\n\r\nHighlight for: The personalities of Junichi who were represented by different versions of himself that are fighting in his head in different scenes that parody other works like godzilla. Another thing that stands out are the last two episodes that, even being childish and clich\u00e9, are very good and use the characters well.\\n\\n\r\nNote: the Shinpei Kirito dress in episode six was also a good detail. Nice easter egg men.\\n\\n\r\nI'll probably read the manga because I want to know how the story ends.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this anime in case you like an unusual novel or just want to see a random ecchi anyway.\\n\\n\r\n[Portugu\u00eas]\\n\r\nPrimeiramente: N\u00e3o entendo como algumas pessoas conseguem odiar esse anime tanto, compreendo o ecchi exagerado e o fan sevice escroto, mas n\u00e3o acho que s\u00e3o motivos para detonar tanto a obra.\\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal conta a historia de Junichi Hashiba, um jovem- virgem- de 15 anos que \u00e9 convencido pelos amigos- Igualmente virgens- a chamar uma gal em namoro. Essa gal \u00e9 Yukana Yame, a outra protagonista, que v\u00ea o Junichi implorando para namora-la ela decide aceitar e os dois come\u00e7am a ficar juntos. De inicio a historia parece ruim (e se for ver bem \u00e9 mesmo), mas o desenrolar da historia \u00e9 boa e interessante, o fato de que as amigas do protagonista gostavam dele \u00e9 um bom detalhe e uma boa adi\u00e7\u00e3o para a fluidez da obra.\\n\\n\r\nNota: Gal seria uma esp\u00e9cie de \u201cvadia\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nDestaque para: As personalidades do Junichi que foram representadas por vers\u00f5es diferentes dele mesmo que ficam brigando na cabe\u00e7a dele em diferentes cenas que parodiam outras obras como godzilla. Outra coisa que se destaca s\u00e3o os \u00faltimos dois epis\u00f3dios que, mesmo sendo infantis e clich\u00eazinhos, s\u00e3o muito bons e utilizam bem os personagens.\\n\\n\r\nNota: o Shinpei vestido de Kirito no episodio seis tamb\u00e9m foi um bom detalhe. Nice easter egg men.\\n\\n\r\nProvavelmente irei ler o manga porque quero saber como a historia termina.\\n\\n\r\nRecomendo esse anime caso voc\u00ea goste de um romance incomum ou s\u00f3 queira ver um ecchi aleat\u00f3rio mesmo.",

(TLDR last paragraph, although for those who don't like annoying characters, i recommend reading my review on the characters of this show.)\r\nWhat do I think of this anime? Well I think it is horrendous, when I first started this anime, I really liked the concept and idea of it because I generally like this kind of anime where 2 characters are dating and slowly build their relationship but this anime ruined it.It had a a lot of potential to at least be a nice RomCom anime but it was dreadful. \\n\\n\r\nWhat made this anime dreadful? There were two main things that made this anime annoying and just straight out pathetic, the characters and the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters: First of I would like to start out with the MC, he is the most useless, pathetic excuse for MC. This MC is so stupid, annoying, and self conscious it makes you want to rip your own head off. The guy cannot think for himself and throughout the whole 10 episode anime he remains the same with little to no character development. In general, if you do decide to watch this, this MC will piss the shit out of you.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the rest of the cast, the MC's friends are the worst friends anyone can have, plus the MC being so dumb to fall for their stupid ideas, you seriously have to be one hell of an idiot to fall for those stupid ideas that will without a doubt get you in trouble leaving those \"friends\" unaffected. \\n\\n\r\nI would like to separately talk about the fat Loli friend in this, his actions were in no way funny, did not make me laugh one bit. That was just a terrible character, a character like that should not even be allowed to exist, I swear to god I see a criminal case here. All in all, this character was not funny, his existence was useless, and I believe the guy who wrote this character should be in jail.\\n\\n\r\nThe female casting in this is all annoying, the whole lot of them except the main heroine who I actually kinda liked but every other female was just straight up annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe story: Terrible, cliche's left and right and executed in the worst way possible. Not funny at all, although I might've cracked a small smile in like 2 maybe 3 eps that's all. Just terrible story.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Terrible anime, terrible characters with every single character on the show getting on your nerves (except maybe the main heroine) and the story was executed horribly. Would not recommend.",

Well think again because this, this is the epitome of ecchi anime, want to know why? No you don't, but here you go, the MC Juchini or Zuccini whatever his name might be, he is a master of words and a slick fella that has the ability of making up hentai scenes with any kind of girl that he wants in his mind. Can you imagine having a power like that? No I can't either, that's why we have Hajimete no Gal a true masterpieceof 2017, beats every anime in any category, you wanna know why, because the art style blows everyone away, the story? Interesting and attractive, it has about 3 arcs and shows all of them in just 10 episodes, besides that, there is no filler in it. The characters of this shows are all deeply thought out and every single one of their actions have a meaning behind them. Overall I give it a 10/10.",

But why the hate?\r\n- The anime really rush into things. \r\nIn the manga the characters were shown when the time past by. They came on a good moment to fill up the story. But in the anime they just came out of nowhere.\r\n- It doesn't really follow the manga.\r\nThe manga is great and it has alot of beautiful moments.\r\nHowever.\r\n- Spoiler -\r\nThe anime doesn't show those moments and just put all the characters in one episode. Some events are shown in the anime but they begin very differently and don't play in the same placethen in the manga. Like the time when junichi and yame first kiss. It happend after the confession of kashii, but in the anime they really rushed the thing with kashii and coulnd't get the chance to let them kiss.\\n\\n\r\n- Characters\\n\r\nThe characters are just basic harem characters nothing new.\\n\r\nWe got the nerd\\n\r\nThe extra guy \\n\r\nThe pedofi.... They went to far.. to far\\n\r\nThe main uncool pervy protagonist\\n\r\nThe hot blonde chick\\n\r\nThe tanned chick\\n\r\nThe loli\\n\r\nAnd the girl with black hair\\n\\n\r\n- It's just a romance\\n\r\nAlot of people tought this was a hardcore ecchi harem anime like DxD, but it's just a solid romance with big boobs and pervy characters. So the people din't get what they wanted. \\n\r\n(cough cough...No Man Sky)\\n\\n\r\nThe story is not bad, it's about a guy who dates a gal and want's to lose his virginity. It's sounds like nothing special but it really is amazing. The romance is pretty damm good to. I just love it when yame bullies junichi or when they are shy. And the comedy is funny as hell to. They both got there own special personality that I havent seen before in other anime so that's why it makes the anime/manga not bad.\\n\\n\r\nMy opinion on the anime is.\\n\r\nIt's trash but it's not bad trash\\n\r\nIt's fun to watch but if you go in full detail it's trash. It's not like I don't like it I actually love it. But it can be better if they just followed the manga. \\n\r\nSo in the end, just read the manga it's amazing! \\n\\n",

            "content": "Ok, this is my first review, so please be kind.\r\nI did not read the manga, so I focus on the anime only.\r\nFirst of all, I do not really understand the many extremely low ratings for this show.\r\nHajimete no Gal is a comedy show with romance plot, with many satiric references to common tropes and other Anime / Manga / LN, and has ecchi scenes and lewd humour, and I will judge it as this.\r\nIf one would rate an ecchi harem as bad, just because it has girls and boobs in it, all of them would get a rating of 1, from Highschool DxD (which ismy favourite in the harem genre) down to Masou Gakuen (which is an ideal bad example for me, make it a real Hentai show and go for it).\\n\\n\r\nI started and binge-watched this show mainly because I was bored and just wanted something to laugh.\\n\r\nYes it features some boobs, but I'm two decades away from being a teenager in emergency state, and so they are nothing but a nice plus, but I didn't come for them, 3D is much better anyway ;)\\n\\n\r\nI have seen many shows that were quite funny or entertaining, but shortly after watching I didn't remember any details.\\n\r\nBut Hajimete no Gal is, at least for me, different and stands out in some way, just after a few episodes I realized that it would stick in my brain for longer, and I was right.\\n\r\nNow I rewatched the series, and feel my first opinion was right.\\n\r\nSo I decided to write this review.\\n\\n\r\nThe story sounds simple: Our virgin protagonist is forced by his 3 completely perverted friends to confess to the ultimate gal, because gals are said to be easy to lay, but they just expect him to fail, and he goes like a lamb to the slaugter.\\n\r\nBut to his very surprise and anger from his friends, she agrees, although she guesses the real reason quite well.\\n\r\nAnd so they start their \"relationship\", which brings some more female rivals into the story, but it is never a real harem show.\\n\r\nThe last two episodes add some drama, and get a little more serious, but I liked the resolving and the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was fine, simple but quite nice and cute. Nothing really outstanding, and more important, no annoying bad CGI shots.\\n\r\nThe censorship is a two-sided sword, I thought is was kind of funny how the harder-ecchi scenes were censored with handbags, costume jewellery, hands and stuff, and even some \"adult only\" comments.\\n\r\nBut come on, you don't have to censor every single panty shot and stuff just to raise the Blu Ray sales...\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was ok as well, OP and ED too were ok, but no earworm for me.\\n\r\nThe only thing that annoyed me was how fast the voice actors talk in the outro, sounds like someone had accidentially pressed the fast forward button.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were not fleshed out very deep, but still deep enough to understand their actions and enjoy the show.\\n\r\nIt is a 10 episodes show after all, and moreover a comedy romance, so I see no added value in explaining everyone's very lives down to the deepest detail, it's just not necessary.\\n\r\nIn the spoiler section below, the characters are discussed more in detail.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, I really liked Hajimete no Gal, it was fun to watch, fun to discover the allusions and parodies, and it went far beyond my initial expectations as just some funny time-killer.\\n\\n\r\n*** The following sections contain spoilers, but I think they are needed for going into detail. ***\\n\r\n*** If you haven't seen the show or don't want any spoilers, just stop here. ***\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist Jun'ichi is quite the typical guy with no outstanding ability, despite his lack of self-consciousness.\\n\r\nHe is kind, but shy, and - most important - he is a virgin, and very unhappy with that and under constant self-pressure because of that.\\n\r\nSo unhappy and desperate that he would do almost anything just to finally get laid - at least in the very beginning.\\n\r\nWhile the series progresses, he gets some chances to actually really get laid, but refuses for different reasons.\\n\r\nHe is not the usual super-dense protagonist, but instead feels kind of realistic, at least for a comedy show.\\n\r\nAnd he gets his development, he discovers his feelings for Yukana and realizes that there is more to life than just have his cherry popped.\\n\r\nAnd he finally overcomes his low self-esteem, which was the reason for his conflict with Yukana, and moreover confesses the real reason of his first confession, and then confesses again, now with his grown true feelings for her.\\n\r\nYes he is a little perverted, but mostly in his thoughts, and not as much in actions like his friends.\\n\r\nBut to be honest, whom of us was not when we were hit hard by puberty, at least a little bit?\\n\\n\r\nThe \"gal\" Yukana seems like the typical gal trope, she has big boobs, open-hearted clothing and likes to tease boys and girls, the loosey-goosey and genki type of person, except she hates perverts.\\n\r\nBut she definitely is not a slut in any way, she is kind, intelligent and seems as unexperienced as Jun'ichi, although we never really get to know.\\n\r\nWhen Jun'ichi confesses to her, she instantly suspects his true motives, but finds him some kind of cute except his pervertedness.\\n\r\nShe sees how shy he reacts when seeing her panty and boobs at close range, and knows he is not the type to violently bring his virginity to an end with her, and so she accepts.\\n\r\nShe teases him a lot, but more in an innocent way, not to offend him.\\n\\n\r\nHer gal friend Ranko is the trope to the extreme, plus she can get quite violent.\\n\r\nShe has also more to offer under her shell, she loves Yukana and doesn't want her to get hurt, and beats up anyone in her way.\\n\r\nShe even goes so far to try to seduce Jun'ichi to break his newly begun relationship with Yukana, because she suspects him of abusing her for losing his virginity, and to protect her.\\n\r\nAlthough he is quite blindsided and petrified as she teases him harder and harder, he manages to refuse her, which gives him some bonus points, although she does not fully trust him.\\n\r\nShe also likes to tease Jun'ichi, but far more direct and dirtier than Yukana, and constantly calls him doutei-kun (doutei=virgin).\\n\\n\r\nJun'ichi's friends, the \"perverted trio\" of the show, often try to convince him of committing lewd acts such as reading ero mags in the classroom, and of course confessing to Yukana to get laid (and happily expecting him to fail).\\n\r\nAt first they envy him because his confession was some sort of success, but they cope with it, and try to support him.\\n\r\nShinpei is quite the leader, he knows everything about women from his ero mags and impresses the others with his wisdom and knowledge, which leads to many comedic scenes, because reality is a little different from his porn mags.\\n\r\nKeigo is the least fleshed out, he mostly moves just with the flow initiated by Keigo.\\n\r\nMinoru is an extreme lolicon, just to the extent that even his friends say he will end in jail sooner or later.\\n\r\nHe is where most critics from other reviews goes, and I must admit that this kind of humour is a hit-or-miss.\\n\r\nYes, he makes constant statements about where to find cute elementary school girls and how much he likes them, and that girls his age are way too old for him.\\n\r\nBut the lolicon trope is soo satirically overdrawn here, you just can't take it serious, well at least I can not.\\n\r\nJust look at some other shows where loli and lolicon tropes are heavily used, but as fanservice and not as a joke.\\n\r\nMaybe I'm seeing to much in this, but I think it holds the mirror to all lolicon otakus.\\n\\n\r\nNene, Jun'ichi's childhood friend, is another example for the comedy character of this show, she is the energetic loli \"little sister\" with extreeemely huge boobs.\\n\r\nSome call it fanservice, I call it satiric and tropes over the top.\\n\r\nShe has feelings for the MC from the beginning on, and as his relationship with Yukana started, she turned herself into a gal and appeared naked in his bed to get him for herself. \\n\r\nBut he refuses her, as he does not want to destroy their friendship, and wants to lose his virginity to someone he loves.\\n\r\nFinally she accepts that, and even supports him in his relationship, although she still teases him.\\n\\n\r\nYui seems kind and dignified from the outside, but is a himedere and secret internet gal under her shell.\\n\r\nShe tries to twist him around her finger and make him her pet dog, like she does with all others around her, and even confesses to him to reach her goal.\\n\r\nBut after he refuses her, she begins to grow real feelings for him, I think just because of that, which is another trope.\\n\r\nShe changes after she discovered her real feelings for him, but still sometimes falls back to old patterns.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also features some inner dialogs and fantasies, mostly of Jun'ichi.\\n\r\nIn these dialogs, his different character traits discuss with each other what to do, one of them being his \"Ero-Me\". \\n\r\nHis fantasies depict the outcome of some special situations, and some of these are not recognized as fantasies right until they are over and the real plot goes on.\\n\\n\r\nDuring this show, I found several references to other works, like when Shinpei appears dressed up as Kirito from SAO when they all play ousama game at Yukana's home.\\n\r\nDuring the girls' job at a cosplay caf\u00e9 named Hybrid Heart (HxH), they are supposed to read ecchi passages from light novels to the customers, namely Highschool DxD, Shinmai Maou no Testament, Nisekoi and Masou Gakuen HxH.\\n\r\nNot to forget the hommage to Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu when the boys dress up in full combat armor to peek on the girls in the onsen.\\n\r\nOh, and his \"Ero-Me\" in his inner dielog reminds me of Hentai Kamen, with the panty over his face.\\n\r\nAnd I think there is more to find for the connaisseur...",

            "content": "Hajimete no Gal; my bane.\r\nStory: Hajimete's story is a fairly simple one, and at first glance it appeared to show a lot of promise, and I expected it to even be a good comedy/ecchi seasonal that could help pass the time. Unfortunately, I was very wrong. Apart from the premise, there is no real story here. More a series of cliches thrown together and characters placed into them to react (I use the term character loosely). Granted, they are cliches for a reason, because they are successful and work, but it is at least my personal opinion that a story cannot be based upon themalone. 2/10 for story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art and animation in Hajimete is an interesting issue. In half of the scenes, it is passable and at standard to be average (like a 5 or 6), but in the other half of the scenes it is quite atrocious. I managed to count a couple times where lip flaps didn't remotely sync up, people's eyes came off of their faces, or were just cropped in side views so that they ended up looking deformed, or just plain horrible. The only saving grace is that whenever the show saw a money-shot, they doubled down on that and the animation went through the roof (always good to see where a show's budget goes). I'm giving this a 3/10 for art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I really tried. but I was unable to really find any solid tracks in the OST whilst watching this. It wasn't bad, per se. But nothing stood out, and it never seemed to accentuate a scene, half the time I didn't even realise it was there, and not in the good ambient way, just in general, due to its lack of an impact on the viewer and the show. A 2/10 for sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This was probably the part about the show that upset me the most, because if the characters were good, I could accept the rest of the show and maybe even bump up a couple numbers here and there, but they're one of the worst aspects of it. Again, calling them characters is a very loose use of the term, character traits would be more accurate. The girls have: the onii-chan loli, the tsundere, the bitch, and the main girl. The males have: the misogynist, the lame one who is also a misogynist, but to a lesser degree, the pedophile and the main character. It's especially funny when the characters are used to point out how hilarious grown men being attracted to small children is, or how women are objects (obvious sarcasm is obvious), and I cannot fathom how several people all agreed that the characters that the audience is supposed to bond with are either one-dimensional, or just plain offensive. In my humble opinion, this can only receive a 1/10 for it's \"characters\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I swore I would never drop an anime that I watched, and this took me over 6 months to get through since I began to watch it and even then it took its toll on me. I found myself continually checking the progress bar and groaning. Words cannot accurately convey my disdain for this anime and as of this date, and most likely forever, I plan to place this anime within its own special circle of hatred within my heart as my least favourite anime. This could only get a 1/10 for enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall, this anime is getting a 1/10. I came in wanting to like it and I just couldn't. With all of its glaring errors/issues in its story/art/sound/character, I would place this in a similar category as hentai, but without the only reason people watch it. I can honestly think of no real redeeming qualities for this anime, try as I might, but all they really had in mind was the traditional 'sex sells'. Ecchi is one of my least favourite genres because of all the pitfalls it can fall into, but if it is done right, it can birth some beautiful and amazing franchises, I'm just disappointed that this ended up falling into the black hole of fanservice, at the expense of the show's quality, or as a substitute for the lack of.",

This visual diatribe of over-sized anatomy should be shelved inside the encyclopedia breastanica alongside its similarly pointless yet plentiful sistren. With no real story and a premise abandoned after the pilot, we're left to voyeur through the harem of a vacuous and microscopically dialogued protagonist. The barren space is then finger painted in with shrill jealousy unattentively gilding pubescent insecurity. \r\nThe characters are glaringly flawed, and rarely act in what should be their own interest. Most egregious is the heroines complete change in personality after just the first episode. Although outside ofthe actual shows content, the jarring incoherence is magnified by the episode ending, which ironically reminds us of the person who we were actually introduced to.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is enjoyable in the comical nature of it's existence. With clear sincerity in its production, it persists as another testament to the anime industries desire to churn out luke warm dead-air filling content.\\n\\n\r\nArt is standard. Sound is Standard.",

            "content": "Story: 3\r\nVery mediocre at best, some parts are so cliche you can actually just skip it. I don't entirely hate the overall story but there are many anime that already done this type, harem/slice of life, that offers a lot more in story, art and enjoyment. It just really feels like it didn't do something new to the mix, the \"Gal\" part of Yame and the ordeal of being a boyfriend of such was only touched only on the first and last episodes.\r\nArt: 3\r\nOh boy, Animation is so bad that some parts of the keyframes are so deformed I can't forget it. Only one commendationis the colors of objects but that's it. I think they just ran out of people during animation since some scene are actually decent to very good looking. I don't like that the supporting roles design, I'm talking about the boy characters, is more developed than the leading role, he looks undercooked.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nOpening and ending theme song is kinda 'meh'. The voice acting another thing tho, I really liked the voice acting it sounds cute.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nWhat's up with Keigo tho? The character could be remove from the anime entirely and it still stands. All characters except for Keigo has established familiarity to me. I can also see that it tries to lure audiences of wanting more of Yame by immediately cutting off scenes on any possible character development. It just make me think that maybe Yame is actually pretty 'easy'.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nThere are some good jokes and gags, since some of it never gets old for me. First five episodes are very enjoyable to watch and it goes down from there. I also just don't like Minoru guy, although he's pretty funny at the end but very creepy tho. I nearly dropped it at episode 8 since but showed a little more faith, but was disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4.2\\n\\n\r\nA very bland half baked anime that can leave a good or bad taste depending on what you are looking for. If you are decent and value your time, I'm gonna suggest that you should pass this anime, BUT if you are looking for an ecchi/harem and just looking to past the time by staring on some big boob girls, HEY this one is for you.",

Though the story was a little whacky and apparently improvised, the entire anime was a satisfying rom-com harem.\r\nThough Yukana's dub voice didn't completely fit her appearance, it was still funny how they portrayed a gal.\r\nThe animation was ok, I thought it was ridiculously funny how the boobs had a mind of their own and moved aroundrandomly.",

            "content": "I don't know why everyone rates this anime so low but it's not really that crap for me.. I can say that this anime is almost decent except for some elements in it. If you take a look at my anime list, you can say that I have seen a lot of romance anime and other things related to this genre. When this anime was announced a few months ago, I got curious about its plot. (Yes.. the plot.. not the PLOT.) At first I was expecting this anime to have a gutless main character who only has luck going for him. Well.. but that'snot all that there is for him. The plot as I have seen it.. yes.. there is plenty of PLOT for this plot so if you happen to be into that sort of thing, yeah you can disregard the plot. One of the particular things that didn't make me give this anime a higher rating is how I was so crept out by one of the characters. Like.. the anime could've been so much better if they just take him out of the story. It just feels weird that he stands out and does something that not related to the plot. Though I suppose he might be there for the comic relief but I think the anime itself has a lot of comedy even without that character. I mean.. wtf.. what he kept thinking for the whole lot of the season was the same damn thing. I think he even stands out way more than the main character. I'm not going to say any spoilers about what his \"creepiness\" is about but let me give you a hint. (Hajimete no Gal is not suitable for \"very young\" audiences.) I hope you get what I mean but if not, just see for yourself. Back to the main topic.. this anime is indeed cliche and your expectations may be spot on, but you might be surprised about some things and give you unexpected reactions. Most people who have seen this anime thought of it as garbage and perhaps one of the worst anime that they have seen. I don't see this one as complete trash because I think each anime has its own uniqueness even if it's a parody. You should watch this if you happen to have plans or continue it if you dropped it. However, I do not guarantee enjoyment because I may have not enjoyed it totally. Still, my curiosity got satisfied and I hope yours will be too. \\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10: Everything might go well for a High-School virgin who thinks he might get a girlfriend easier in high school.. however.. will that be the case?\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: The Art style is promising and it is how it is on covers and previews. I recommend uncensored but watch at your own risk. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10: So may weird things about their physical appearances. Their personalities are however, not that unique. The main character had a bit of development at least. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10: Weee!!! Happy endings. Well what do you expect from an anime with comedy?\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10: I don't think it deserves a full 10. It's not just that creepy supporting character that got me sick but it might be the cringe. \\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal was not that trashy for me. I hope you won't get disappointed after watching it.",

            "content": "I feel like I'm obligated to put a disclaimer at the beginning of this review: having heard the opinion of various sources I watched the dub, not the sub of Hajimete no Gal.\r\nI have to start off by saying that in most areas Hajimete no Gal is a completely average anime. The story is pretty typical romcom. Main guy is more popular than he realizes, something good happens to him, same old same old. The art? Alright. Had some good areas, had some really not good areas, but it's that kind of obviously not high budget typical romcom kind of animation that I've grown asoft spot for. The sound track is nothing to rave about, and honestly both the opening and ending were forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where things start to pick up though and where I try to justify my score. For one, I loved the characters. It was one of the few anime where the main character had some generic friend group where you could actually feel their connection to that group. His friends, save the blonde one whose name I can't even remember, were full of personality. While the main character himself was kind of the generic plug in character sort, even he showed to have a surprisingly round personality in the dub. One thing I felt was a nice touch was the kind of modern take on some typical romcom stereotypes. Take Yui, your typical two faced princess who refers to the main character as her\" dog who winds up being a cam girl who only shows her true nature to her fans online.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this dub. Enough that I'd recommend anyone even remotely curious about this anime who doesn't have an issue watching dubs to give the dub a shot. While I know many of the voice actors don't have a lot under their belt, they did a good job with their characters. And the script was hilariously written. Whoever localized this thing deserves a raise. The references of \"cucks\" and pop culture references towards reddit and the like, it really worked. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a fun show, at least as a dub. While it doesn't really hold any rewatchability to make me come back to it in the future, it was a good experience and I would happily watch a season 2.",

I personally found the manga \"reasonably\" entertaining to read - so I had some expectations that the show would be portrayed more in a comical way. However, this just ended up being a show that tried to take it self seriously, whilst trying to play any serious thought or moment off as a rom com. Its just a cheap filler animethat comes along with any anime season, but like any filler anime the choice is still yours to watch it and skipping this show would be a wiser choice.",

I gave it a 7, and it could've been an 8 if the character's had developed a little more personally. It felt as if they were going to build up to something deep but, those moments were shadowed and interrupted, 95% of the time, by comedy. Don't get me wrong this is hilarious, and the references makethis a staple dub for 2017. However, just a small break to flesh out what could've been would've easily pushed it up to an 8. Bottom line: watch it. Just be sure you're watching the dub, and you've got headphones on or are alone.",

Ranko is a supporting character and is a friend of Yame who is also a gyaru she has a pretty almost mean streak with Junichi (you'll she it in the anime so yeah) cause Ranko really likes Yame wouldn't say yandere but kinda close also no idea if shes actually bi or a lesbian but yeah a decent character. Nene is another supporting character she isn't a gyaru but she becomes one just for Junichi also should mention that they are childhood friends otherwise shes a pretty happy girl. Yui is another supporting character and the last person ill cover here she is well a gyaru as well but she only really shows it on live streams but she does like Junichi but as more of a servant basically like that she is a pretty nice character here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Things that i liked: this anime is actually pretty funny like i was laughing pretty good through out this whole anime and it was really just a enjoyment to watch and also the ecchi isn't really have bad either honestly. Things that i didn't like: ill say honestly its about to character first Nene i actually liked her but the thing is they put her in highschool gave her a loli type body (which i don't mind) but thing is they gave her boobs the size of a basketball or a watermelon which is unrealistic to me. also another character Minoru he well is a total pedophile he likes kids even in a episode he has a map where all the little girls live like yeah a freaking terrible character. this is more for people this anime has a F ton of ecchi so if that's not your thing than don't watch this i love ecchi so this anime didn't bother me or anything.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: im giving this anime a 8 yes i actually am i can understand why this this anime gets the hate it does but honestly this anime is actually a enjoyable watch when it comes to the comedy to the bits of romance in also to just to how i pretty much loved all the characters (expect one) to how enjoyable this anime was to the ecchi being pretty good as well don't just write it off when you look at it this anime is easily worth the watch and i do recommend it.",

Yes, this should be labeled as a harem, and yes, the humor can sometimes be rather juvenile and overblown/redundant, but I don't know what most of the reviewers were expecting from this show?  It is wacky, stupid, pervy fun tbh, with a bit of hard-felt emotion mixed in.  The characters were all unique in their own way, and the shenanigans kept me entertained throughout all 10 episodes.\r\nMaybe I am just easy to please with this type of show, but I just go in with the expectations not to be bored. In addition, tohoping that some ridiculous plot twist or stale trope is not thrown in.  There was one in my opinion that can be overlooked in the grand scheme of the show, and didn't take place until the last couple episodes, and it was rather quickly resolved.\\n\\n\r\nEither way I finished the show in two days and enjoyed every episode.  This is the kind of show one must watch for themselves, and know they like the genre of, to really know whether they will enjoy it or not.

Ok it's a harem anime, but it's awkwardly silly to see those girls runbehind this couple. They could have been a little more competitive about winning Jounichi but they were just side characters with no reason existing, even if they could be more important to the development of the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the anime was Jounichi's friends.

            "content": "Never have I watched a show of any kind; anime or otherwise, that was so utterly without merit as Hajimete no Gal. I'll keep this review fairly short as it only really serves as an attempt to deter other innocent passers by from getting tricked into watching this complete travesty of creative entertainment. \r\nThere's basically no plot, the characters are all completely unlikable, the art is bland, everything about it is incredibly cheap. I understand that a lot of anime fans are into cute girls in the shows they watch, but there are plenty of other shows out there with cute girls in them thatalso have some semblance of artistic integrity. Steer Clear. \\n\\n\r\nAnother point I think worth making is that as a westerner that's into anime, one has to be fairly open minded when it comes to some of the cultural differences present but I'm calling BS on this one. There's always a line, and for me trivialising and even at times glorifying a character that is basically a grade 1 paedophile is so far beyond that line. I understand that the Japanese attitude to younger girls is a little different to ours and I'm basically ok with that, but I challenge anyone to argue that creating a character that explicitly lusts after girls aged in the single digits is acceptable in any corner of the world. It was totally deplorable and wholly uncomfortable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nAt the time of my writing, this show scores roughly a 6.5/10. Given the fact that I scored it a 1 that must mean that two other people must have scored it at about a 7. given the breadth of bad reviews it tends to suggest that a fair few out there actively enjoyed this show. I've usually felt pretty at home within the anime community but that idea that this show isn't occupying the dregs of the rating system makes me pretty suspicious of the community as a whole. It's difficult to imagine anyone sensible could like something as dire; both ethically and creatively, as this steaming pile of animated faeces. \\n\\n\r\nApologies if I sound a little hard line",

The story was meh, I thought it was OK at best, but upon reaching the ending of the anime, I was scratching my head at the fact that nothing made any sense (Don't worry I'm not spoiling anything for it). The art was also OK, its not particularly Koi to Uso or Kimi No Nawa amazing, but is overall bearable and enjoyable (Not many complaints here). The characters were some very well thought out people. Being honest here, the friends of the main character really reminding me of myself and my friends... I mean mygroup, we're a bunch of weirdos with the lolicon in our group as well as the major weebs. Lastly, I'm going to say this... If you are expecting something great from this mediocre anime, don't. Instead watch something else, like High School Dxd or Boku no Tomodachi if you're looking for an OK anime with the R+ rating. This is because there's no nudity, no real plot nor is there anything that sets this anime apart from others, therefore I give it a 5/10.",

            "content": "[THIS MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS, THEY WILL BE NOTED]\r\nI believe this deserves a chance. Compared to the manga, the anime lacks a lot of stuff. Pretty much the anime tries to summarize everything that happened in the manga in a different way. I mean trying to fit 41 chapters(as of Sept 14th 2017) into 10 episodes seems kinda hasty. Probably some OVAs instead of making it a series would have reached higher scores.\r\nThis is why I give it a 6.5(a 7 in MAL rating to help a bit). Due to the anime summarizing, makes the story look poor compared to the manga where the interactionbetween the 2 MCs is better and goes more in-depth and more comedic, music is good as i'm not that quite demanding about bgm and stuff. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are your regular virgin guys but they are quite funny although I found one of the MC's friends quite creepy (you will find why if you watch/read it). Girls well... sometimes you feel like you want to put on your coat and be full on Thot Patrol but the female MC sometimes feels that she's not the girl you think she is and she's actually cute and enjoyable. (POSSIBLE SPOILER HERE ->)... I mean the show tries to suggest the viewers that the girls are ridiculously slutty but you find out that Yame  isn't actually that kind of girl, and Ranko actually makes herself to be respected.\\n\\n\r\nAlso its important to mention that the manga is still not finished. I have a feeling that the anime could have a 2nd season if the manga keeps going as well as it is but (SPOILER HERE->) considering that the 1st kiss in the manga and anime happen in such different situations and the anime ending with Yame's old friend causing trouble I doubt it. He hasn't even showed up in the manga and i'm not sure if he will show up as it could've been improvised to finish the series at 10 episodes. [END OF SPOILER]\\n\\n\r\nFor anyone else who haven read it yet, I highly recommend it. Personally I like anime more than reading manga (weird isn't it? all people I know prefer manga x100 times than anime) and this time I can be 1000% sure that manga is actually pretty great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5 \\n\\n\r\nIf you dont have anything else to watch, give this a chance, you might enjoy it but, if you want to really enjoy it read the manga.",

            "content": "Hajimete no Gal finally comes to an end, and when compared to its counterparts in the Summer 2017 line-up, this series has its own ups and downs. Here's purely my personal thoughts about Hajimete no Gal:\r\nStory: I appreciate the attempt of the studio to change the storyline from the original work, but I have to say, it's quite a mess to be honest. No clear character development, this anime is all about the MC's daily life, and basically how bad he is when it comes to relationships. Bland storyline with tons of fanservices, this is a clich\u00e9-fest anime but somehow still enjoyable. 6/10.\r\nArt: The artwas quite good at the beginning, but my god did they run out of budget or something?! Distant views is crappy as hell, with the characters' face all got distorted in some janky-wacky ways, the background was okay, but the motion looks like they were all robots. And hell Nene-chan's...Speechless. I think they only got Yame right. 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I really enjoyed the opening: Hajimete no SEASON by Junjou no Afilia. Catchy as hell. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Junichi and Yame completed their roles there, with Junichi's a typical, normal high school student who has a relationship with a hot-looking, attractive girl. Yame in contrary is actually caring and somewhat naive. The chemistry between them makes this series actually enjoyable. The supporting characters are a mess with a secretly-a-streamer-and-a-masochist girl, a puberty-hits-her-too-hard girl, a pedophile, an attractive blond guy with no screentime, and a quite dangerous friend who has unexpected plans. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime is quite enjoyable, for someone just want a laugh after a long day. I wouldn't recommend this to everyone, but it's okay to watch.",

            "content": "When I first started watching this series, I didn't gave it much attention due to the bad impression of Yame and Junichi's friends, thinking they were annoying, one being a stuck up b*tch,while the others were just generic loners. \r\nYet I continued watching it, and I did not regret it. Firstly, because they didn't made Yame the aforementioned stuck up b*tch, secondly the series did something really special that I really enjoyed through the season: They destroyed the \"horny virgin boy's\" kind of myths in some episodes, and also not giving us a spineless pervert as a main character, just like oh so many otherharem-ecchi anime did.\\n\\n\r\nThis take on ecchi romance made me watch the series onward, buying themselves time to further develop the supporting characters personalities, on which the show does a decent job, giving each of these support characters some much needed positive characteristics thus making them bearable, after giving our fairly nice MC quite the hard time, with the flood of terrible ideas from one side, and the numerous sabotages from the other.\\n\\n\r\nMentioning Mr. MC, or rather MCs (plural), As mentioned before our male Main character named Junichi is a nice guy, even tho he admits he is a perverted virgin looser, just like his friends, and there are some cases where he does show this perversion. Even tough this does not make him unlikable.\\n\\n\r\nHowever the show struggles with our female lead character named Yame, because she is almost nonexistent. We don't really get anything about her, and the story does not develop her relationship with Junichi. Spoilers ahead: The only kiss in the last episode.\\n\r\nEach episode we see our MC struggling to keep, further, on not f*ck up his romance with his loved one, but we rarely see any development caused by this.\\n\r\nJunichi gets more sexuality from the shows other female character of whom two of them even tried to have sexual intercourse with him.\\n\r\nThe only thing keeping Yame and Junichi together in this show is that Yame smiles nicely in the end of each episode. \"There, you can now go and f*ck yourself\", I imagine what the director is thinking every time the EP stars...\\n\\n\r\nSound and animation-wise the show does decent. It doesn't suck, but its not a Kimi no Na wa. However I have to mention the terrible censorship the show has. The weird kid art is really distracting in such a way that I have to say, even though I despise fan service, I'd rather would not have them...\\n\\n\r\nAs a final verdict, I do not recommend it to watch. It may sound I enjoyed it, which I did, but ma of you would not bear the (censored) fan service, and some really weird events normally would not happen trough real life.\\n\r\nHowever, if you are interested to hear about the not a perverted virgin boy who found of a relationship isn't just about sex, go watch it.",

They've gotten to me so badly that I felt the character's feelings of both Junichi and Yukana and how they rectified the situation. I still feel the last episode on my heart like it's weighing down on me so heavily.\r\nThe plot is unique, and the gradual elevation in emotions is worth complimenting for with a great supporting cast for the two main characters. Although, it didn't follow the manga, it createdit's own universe and took out the best parts of the mange and put it in the anime with such an amazing connection.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a much watch for Romantics. The comedy is outstanding.",

CM PUNK !!!!!) I enjoyed it because personally I can relate to it since (yes) I'm a virgin as well, I mean I'm 20 now and still I don't have any girlfriend ever since nor I haven't kissed a girl yet. BUT WHATEVS RIGHT !!!!!!\r\nthe only problem is just like any other10-13 episode rom com anime, they focus more on fan service instead of the real plot where (junichi wonders if he's really worthy of Yukana)\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't until episode 9 where things got serious but alas they rushed it, on top of that I think the introduction of the secondary characters should have been shorter.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nWhile they are pretty forgettable except for Yukana because of her design, I find all likable, I can relate to John cena I MEAN JUNICHI for what i said, and I think him and Yukana made a great couple\\n\\n\r\nI also enjoys how he fights his perversion, especially the scene with nene,...DAMN !!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nanyways regtarding the rest there's nothing much to say but they're okay, I'm just glad that they weren't there.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Art\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I think the sound is average, none of the OSt's weren't that remembering the art though I think okay I like Yukana's design, for nene though ohh...THAT AIN'T OPPAI BOY!!! I'm cool with loli having big boobs but something like nene's... (man Joe's gonna kill her)\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nwell despite all those cliches I actually enjoyed it,  personally If you wanna watch and enjoy the series make sure you watch it in the right time, when sunny I guess and if you just want to cringe in an anime\\n\\n\r\n but that's just about it......",

There were many instances where I thought the scenes were funny and I thought that the ecchi was entertaining. However after a while the show for whatever reason fell flat and became average.\r\nThe story itself outside of the comedic moments was bland. Much of the same can be said for the art, animation and sound. There wasn't much to like about the individual characters in Hajimete no Gal although I will say that how the characters interacted with each other was where Igot most of my enjoyment from this show. In particular, I thought the various personalities of Junichi whenever he had his fantasies were entertaining and it's a shame they didn't get more screen time.\\n\r\nAs far as ecchi anime is concerned, this show isn't bad but apart from that, there are some other anime you can check out before this one.",

            "content": "\"What does she even see in him?\" is an obvious statement LA would place on the main couple of Junichi Hashiba and Yukana Yame.\r\nHajimete no Gal is a rather strange romance anime for LA to look at, as it has fanservice and it flaunts it without a care, yet the anime also acts as a harem with a supporting cast of characters helping our main couple here, YET it does almost everything in it's power to make it as cringy and awkward as possible.\r\nSo let's start with the flaws and there's a bit to unpack, let's start with Junichi's 3 useless friends of Shinpei,Keigo and urghhh Minoru. These three characters reminds LA ALOT of Green Green's main protagonist's friends but alot less intense except one. These three character ruin, make things worse for Junichi, are useless, plot forced fanservice and are the ones essentially the kick start Junichi and Yukana's relationship yeah seriously. The most annoying character for Summer 2017 (yeah not just this anime) would go to the extremely creepy Minoru for OBVIOUS reasoning LA won't bring up here. So LA said this was a supporting harem and the other love interests for Junichi of Yui Kashii voiced by Ayana Taketatsu who's one of the most popular girls in the school but hides a secret and Nene Fujinoki voiced by Yui Ogura the backbreakingly Eiken-like loli of the harem who just happened to be childhood friends of Junichi comes into the mix and to be fair both characters are interesting, mainly because of Yui's character development about looking at Junichi in a differing light throughout the series and Nene's attempts of being a gal and kinda failing are interesting quirks to them HOWEVER since they are a supporting cast it's to be expected what's gonna happen to them with them cheering on the sidelines and the occasional emotional support when drama appears (which it does). LA won't say this is a horrible flaw but an expected intentional one.\\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal's strength's may be sparse but nonetheless, let's start with Junichi and Yukana's relationship, by the best it's puppy love in which both sides are naive about being in love and they both show it, it's actually one of the purest things in this anime and it's kinda adorable when they get their moments. What's more is that Junichi as much of a perverted white knight character he is, he's STILL one of most interesting characters in the anime if not because of his naive romantic puppy love relationship with Yukana. Yukana also has this, mainly because she's one of those character like in Oshiete Galko-chan! where appearance can be deceiving and her personality is not limited to being a gal and nothing more and again this is emphasized with her relationship with Junichi. Compounding this is that LA actually found the main couple of an anime series to be more interesting than the beta couple or other supporting characters and whether this was intentional through the useless best friends of Junichi or the harem members of Junichi to be supportive of Yukana's relationship, although this felt rather intentional it's a strength nonetheless.  Lastly, Ranko Honojou voiced by Eri Kitamura is probably the MVP of this anime series as she does most of the heavy lifting in helping the main couple's relationship, though her ulterior motive is that she wants to protect Yukana but nonetheless she's the most reliable character in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation by NAZ has moments of being decent with the rather \"exotic\" character designs and bland looking backgrounding. Though NAZ isn't without it's derpy animation and it appears alot in this anime especially the finale. The character designs if anything is the only thing to talk about as a strength. Lastly this anime's censorship is \"different\" to say the least but doesn't cover enough but easily tells us what's going on under the smoke and mirrors censorship anyways...it's \"meh\". \\n\\n\r\nOn speaking of censorship, the fanservice in this anime is rampant from Junichi's lusty fantasies to beach episodes to cosplays and *ahem* erotic reading and Nene. The fanservice \"varies\" to say the least, at worst cringy and awkward as hell, at best...it's \"trying\".\\n\\n\r\nThe voice work in this anime is decent enough though LA would point out that Yukana Yame's voice actor Yuki Nagaku is being diverse by playing this role as LA really didn't expect Ichigo Moesaki to voice a gal-like pure maiden character but all the power to her to actually pull it off. Eri Kitamura has been eerily typecasted as the tough yet rather perverted girl characters  but still did great in this anime and this statement can be said for Yui Ogura and Ayana Taketatsu and their respective character traits (almost like the point of them being in their role were to be stereotyped yet parodied at the same time).\\n\\n\r\nSo to actually answer the question LA said at the start of this anime review of \"What does she even see in him?\" comes at the thought that both characters are naive characters towards being in a relationship yet both of them wanting to progress and see to it that both of them are happy with each other and seriously in all honesty this is probably Hajimete no Gal's best strengths however is largely detrimented by it's useless male supporting characters and it's awkward attempts at humor and fanservice barring more screentime between our main couple, sure LA can compliment the finale it brought for our main couple after a rather annoying misunderstanding and self-deprecation by Junichi's part and Yukana for not being upfront about the situation which leads to some genuine attempts of romance but it was little too late and to little in general with all the awkward and cringy humor LA had to endure to get to that point. \\n\\n\r\nHajimete no Gal is \"meh\" by the end of it but it had the potential of being a much better romance if it wasn't trying to make awkward cringy humor all the time and actually gave more screentime to our main couple.",

            "content": "For the most part, romance in anime centers around the build-up to the relationship and not the relationship itself.\u00a0 While examples of stories revolving around established couples exist, the common way to write romance involves making the audience wait for the confession/kiss before ending things when things get good.\u00a0 So...what happens when you put an established couple...in a harem comedy?\u00a0\u00a0\r\nStory: Hashiba Junnichi is a dreamer.\u00a0 Despite being an ordinary student without many redeeming factors to speak of, he hopes one day that he'll get a girlfriend and 'graduate' from being a virgin.\u00a0 So, after his idiot pervert friends pressure him into confessing to a galnamed Yukana, he...gets the girl and is now dating a gal.\u00a0 Yeah, he actually gets the girl.\u00a0 Who'da thunk?\\n\\n\r\nFollowing the original manga with a few liberties taken at the beginning in order to introduce the rest of the cast, Hajimete no Gal presents itself as a romantic high school comedy with all of the charm and delicacy of a bull in a tutu running through a china shop.\u00a0 The structure of the show has each episode act as a 'test' for our protagonist as he attempts to get closer and understand his new girlfriend, as various members of the cast get in the way and try to in loose terms, sabotage the new relationship that Junnichi has with his new girlfriend.\u00a0 As a result, Hajimete no Gal manages to pull off some meaningful and important growth for our main protagonist that otherwise would've left him as some bland protagonist without redeeming qualities.\\n\\n\r\nGoing back to the metaphor however, the show plagues the genuine and positive relationship that it's trying to establish between its dual protagonists by littering as many scenes as it can with awful, perverted antics, conflicting motives, really uncomfortable moments, and many, many daydreams from Junnichi himself that often times rescinds the positive outlook that it's trying to establish for its main character.\u00a0 As such, the show combats itself with what it wants to do, going back and forth trying to decide if it wants to be a genuine romance story between two unlikely candidates, or some perverted comedy without anything of value besides entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to pacing, as everything from its character arcs and comedic timing really leaves a lot to be desired.\u00a0 With a runtime of ten episodes, the show managed to squeeze as much of the original manga as it could by rushing through the more prominent character arcs into one or two episodes.\u00a0 As a result, these 'character arcs' become rushed and lack impact due to how fast they go by, leaving very little emotional impact for the audience to feel.\u00a0 Comedic timing also seems to be this series's weak suit, as so many of the gags and jokes the show uses become tired and old due to their frequency and the subject matter at hand.\u00a0\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Hajimete no Gal had a story that faltered because it felt like it wanted to be a meaningful between two people in a relationship, but also really wanted to focus on explaining the glory that is having a sexy, busty girl straddle you in an uncomfortably annoying and needy fashion.\u00a0 Its ending tied itself up with a contrived, clich\u00e9 two parter that creates a problem only to resolve it quickly and return everything back to the status quo, and any genuinely good moments that the show displayed were overshadowed by the tidal wave of garbage perverted comedy that it really wanted to exemplify.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Has genuinely good moments between the two main characters\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Rushed character arcs\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Terrible comedic timing\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Confused identity\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: At face value, the characters in this show really fall into two camps.\u00a0 You have the main couple, and then you have the other people who feel like they're just kind of there.\\n\\n\r\nThe harem trope of having a bland protagonist so that the male viewer can project onto them because they lack any kind of personality really comes into play here with Junnichi.\u00a0 At first, all he wants to do is have sex and lose his virginity because that's apparently so important that that needs to be your only character trait.\u00a0 While it's easy to dismiss his character as that, time and time again in the show, we see Junnichi act faithful as we're shown that unlike his male compatriots, he's actually a genuinely sweet guy that thinks about the feelings of his girlfriend rather than having his genitals decide what should be done.\u00a0 It was actually refreshing to see moments of him going out of his way and try and prevent anything bad to happen to Yukana and the rest of the girls and really was a redeeming trait that I really liked.\\n\\n\r\nIn the same vein as that, Yukana, despite boasting the 'trashy gal girl' persona, is similarly a sweet girl who wants to spend time with her boyfriend.\u00a0 She teases him, gets close to him, and above all, genuinely seems to like him aside from the generic 'nice' characteristic that all bland protagonists like him seem to have.\u00a0 While certainly not used as much, as Junnichi's trials and tribulations to become someone worthy of her is a far more prominent plot point, Yukana manages to be somewhat of an endearing character cause she never seems to boast any overly annoying or outlandish traits for the sake of making her another rehash of a trope.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is split into the other six 'friends' of the main duo with an even split between both sexes.\u00a0 The girls themselves are the ones with 'character arcs', as the early episodes focus on each of them one at a time with how they react to the the main characters' relationship and their attempt to sabotage what's already been established.\u00a0 They're not great, they're all basically just a rehashed trope (Yuri, childhood friend, and queen bee complex respectively), and they all really could've used more time, but they're at least tolerable and add SOMETHING to the individual characters.\u00a0 The guys on the other hand...\\n\\n\r\nThere's something to be said when the entirety of your male side cast is comprised of nothing but a trio of scumbags who want nothing more than to getting into a girl's pants by ANY means, going so far as to force them do stuff via the King Game in one episode.\u00a0 The latter half of the show has these jackasses act as the major obstacle for Junnichi's success in his relationship with his girlfriend.\u00a0 And if that wasn't bad enough, they even established one of them being a straight up pedophile who does nothing but talk about how great grade school girls are.\u00a0 Why was this allowed?!\u00a0 Who thought this was a good idea?!\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Relatively good main duo\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Female side cast could've used a lot more time\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Absolutely god awful male side cast\\n\\n\r\nArt: Made by NAZ, Hajimete no Gal's art is standard fare with very few outstanding qualities.\u00a0 Colors are bright, the animation's fluid enough to convey what's going on, and the comedic aspects of the show are filled with your typical exaggerated expressions in order to better give off the perverted comedy that the show's trying to convey.\\n\\n\r\nHowever what is outstanding is the show lack of shame when it comes to gratuitous fanservice.\u00a0 While the designs for the girls are quite overdone with sexual traits, Nene in particular just exudes problematic character design, as she is a four foot girl with breasts so large that they're three times the size of her head EACH.\u00a0 It's really uncomfortable to look at, it's not attractive, why would you do this?\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the show will on a dime, pad out the runtime with scenes involving the females in various poses and articles of clothing in order to accentuate their womanly aspects.\u00a0 There're at least thirty or so flashbacks/transitions into Junnichi's raunchy fantasies/inner turmoil, all of them involving Yukana in some way 'taking the lead'.\u00a0 Again, it's just gratuitous, and honestly really doesn't have any value.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Decent art\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Far too much gratuitous fanservice\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Some problematic character designs\\n\\n\r\nSound: In terms of sound, both\u00a0\"Hajimete no SEASON\" and\u00a0\"GAL-tic Love\", the show's OP and ED respectively, sound remarkably similar with the only difference being that the ED has a more rock-based tune compared to the OP's cheerful and upbeat tune.\u00a0 I'd say they're pretty average, so they're not really a song worth pointing out.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Having read the original manga, I could see a lot of carryover with a heaping dose of gratuitous fanservice in order to pad out the show's runtime cause apparently, they didn't have enough source material to fill up a runtime shorter than most anime.\u00a0 In the end however, I can't really note the show as something I really enjoyed.\u00a0 I didn't hate it, but it wasn't great.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of actual enjoyment, the relationship between Junnichi and Yukana was definitely one of if not the only highlight this show had.\u00a0 There actually seemed to be something between the two of them, and that was an aspect of the show that I really appreciated cause it gave some value to what would otherwise just be some trashy show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nFuck you, Minoru.\u00a0 Like actually, fuck you.\u00a0 Pedophile characters aren't great, but when the show actively tries to establish a character having a map of all of the houses of where little girls live, get hot and heavy just thinking about them, consistently say \"Grade schoolers are the best\", choose to go to the men's side of the hot springs for the sole purpose of seeing little girls naked, and going up and talking to them just to say how much he loves them, THEN YOU HAVE A FUCKING PROBLEM.\u00a0 It's not funny, it's super uncomfortable, oh my god why the hell would you think this is a good idea?\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nHonestly...the show is not worth it.\u00a0 Despite me claiming that it actually has a decent romantic relationship between the two main characters, I would highly advise against watching this show.\u00a0 Its good traits are overshadowed so much by its less desirable and downright uncomfortable aspects that it actively becomes a burden just to see the glimmer of quality development that the show has.\u00a0 And seriously, why the hell would you make one of your characters a godforsaken child predator for the sake of comedy?\u00a0 I cannot stress why that is such a terrible idea.",

            "content": "If you are expecting an anime with a really good plot and character development... then DON'T WATCH IT! \r\nPLOT: This anime takes place in a high school where Junichi has a goal of pursuing romance and taking it to the next level. It is very episodic but it contains a lot of ecchi, comedic with a taste of slice of life taking place during school. \r\nCHARACTERS:\r\nJunichi: High school student who is dating Yukana. He is awkwardly-shy when he is around her. (He is trying to learn the boundaries in a relationship).\r\nYukana: One of the most popular girls in school who dresses up in very revealingclothing. However; her heart is pure and finds Junichi cute and funny.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: The anime is fine, but it contains a lot of ecchi that can be really uncomfortable for some viewers (including me, because they tend to take it too far with some moments). Expect fan service and references. This anime focuses on the relationship between Yukana & Junichi (& other funny moments including the popular girls in school going after him too). There are also some other moments with other characters where it can be seen as wrong!!",

            "content": "MINOR SPOILERS\r\nI don't know why i even decided to watch this show, seeing as i don't deal with this genre but i can tell you that i was pleasantly surprised.\r\nI watched the first episode and i couldn't stop. Sure, there are tons of ecchi/harem anime out there, but allow me to explain why i thought this was a little different.\r\nStory - 7\r\nEnter our young and hopeful MC, who hopes to finally get a girlfriend in high school and free himself from the bonds of virginity.Pretty noble goal, if you ask me.\r\n This should tell you that the show doesn't take itself seriously and that's notnecessarily a bad thing, it's not trying to be Death Note or something. \\n\\n\r\n Of course things aren't going to be that easy, given that he's very shy and his choice of friends don't help either. \\n\\n\r\nThey serve as comic relief for the show, driving our MC into unexpected situations, some of which turn out to be very beneficial to him. Infact they indirectly help him get his first girlfriend, and the whole thing originally started out as a joke.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is fun and somewhat predictable, but that doesn't kill the fun. Fanservice, humor, unexpectedly clever plans and some twists here and there. \\n\\n\r\nArt -8\\n\\n\r\nI like the vibrant colours the show uses to portray characters, and the way it presents backgrounds and the settings in general. \\n\r\nThe background characters feel lively enough, colours are used intelligently. Even the ''gals'' from the show who are dress really flashily look decent enough despite the multitude of colours used in their character design. Character costumes were well designed,especially the maid outfits and swimsuits. All for the plot.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\\n\r\nNothing too great to talk about here. I really feel like some scenes which were intended to be really funny got bogged down a little bit by the soundtracks which sometimes really didn't match the intensity of the scene in question. \\n\\n\r\nThe show makes good use of soundtracks, but some of them don't match their respective scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\\n\r\nNow i feel like this is where this show really shines. The cast is varied, there aren't two characters who are identical. The MC starts out as a really insecure guy and a loser, and towards the end of the show you can notice some changes. He's now willing to stand up for what he thinks is right, and doesn't mind sacrifising himself to save others.\\n\\n\r\nHe also has his own flaws, as throughout the show he deals with his own fears. He often makes bad decisions and can be a little insensitive, and that's what makes him so relatable. \\n\\n\r\nThe MC's three friends are your typical harem protagonist side kicks, except that this show doesn't follow the conventional harem route. At the beginning all the girls wants a piece of the MC, but as time passes it is made clear that the MC and his girlfriend are inseparable, especially with a really well executed scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC's friends are a blue haired haired glasses nerd, a wild looking cool guy and a fat guy who loves kids. That is the best i could do to describe them. I also found them to be a little similar to Kiyoshi's friends from prison school. They serve as comic relief and unwittingly help out the MC in more ways than one while not totally being left out.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC has a slew of girls clinging onto him, the big boobed loli, the Kuro gal and the self centered girl. Their motivations for wanting to date the MC differ, but they all want a piece of him nonetheless. This makes for some funny scenes, which reveal more about the girls themselves. The show does a good job of explaining their motives and how the MC survives them everyday.\\n\\n\r\nThe MC's girlfriend starts out slowly but starts to get some real development when a guy from her past shows up. The guy is better than the MC in almost all aspects which leads to a situation where the MC suspects his girl of cheating. It doesn't help that she is really close to him, frankly this was my favorite part of the show. How she has to clear things up with our MC who is losing it and thinking of breaking up. The situation gets even worse when they completely fail to understand each other, and their relationship is in danger.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\\n\r\nThis show provided what i expected while watching it - fun. I didn't expect excellent writing or something totally new, and you shouldn't either. The show is fun in all aspects, from the characters to the hilarious plans they come up with. It just feels great to see how they try to outwit each other to gain the MC's affection, and how the poor guy has to deal with his crazy friends and their twisted ideas. If you've got a sense of humor, you'll need it here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't say Hajimete No Gal is bad, if you've had your fill of ecchi/harem then please don't bother as it doesn't introduce anything totally new. It instead makes use of what it can (which you've probably seen already) to present it's own ideas. If you're looking for something silly and fun to watch, you've got the right show otherwise keep looking. \\n",

This anime has made me change that. \r\nA great interesting anime grabs you by your arm and makes you exclaim \"what the hell is this anime?!\", I'm not being hyperbolic when i say that it did. The comedy, characters -- especially Yame Yukana, roped me in. Yame turns out to be a very down to earth character, despite the first episode. Honestly the comedy along with the characters are enough to keep me watching. The story obviously leaves muchto be desired, but the interesting characters more then make up for that. I will probably finish the season. The \"goal\" of the anime is a pretty simple one for junichi to get laid, so this anime can't have that long of a run, but I hope they find a way to extend it somehow. Perhaps trying to help his friends get laid for later archs?",

            "content": "I want to like the anime more than the manga... because it reaches more people, and everyone should see how cute the story (of the manga) is. But after 8 episodes and very little progress, I have to say: if you're watching the anime, go on, but overwrite everything you've seen by reading the manga after that... there is waaaaaay more progress with the two main characters, the other characters are actually side-characters and don't appear as often as in the anime - and lets be honest: side characters are filler-characters in every romcom.\r\nThe animation quality in HajiGal is also pretty bad, but at leastYame-san is drawn fine 90% of the time... the animation style is one which I really like, they just need to draw it properly... \\n\\n\r\nThe music is ok, nothing special... although there seem to be a few awesome tracks, if you pay attention you might be surprised. All in all it's above average. The voice acting is... a ten, I have nothing to complain there.\\n\\n\r\nThe story in the anime feels like: they don't want to make progress only to fill those 10 episodes with something. It's still a great story and the comedy parts are fun, but the manga is much better because it's more about the romance parts.\\n\r\nI understand that they remixed the storyline to let the other girls appear earlier, but that makes it feel like a harem anime, although it's not: the two main characters are a couple and everyone knows that. Or you can say it's about one route, so there would probably be no harem ending.\\n\r\nAlso, certain arcs from the manga wouldn't fit into anime episodes, so they changed the order of things. That's ok, you can see the manga and anime as two different stories and watch/read one without spoiling the other too much. But I definitely recommend checking out the manga if you like this anime just a bit... \\n\r\nI'm sure there won't be as much progress in those 10 episodes as in the manga, but see this anime as a trailer to manga, if you like romantic comedys.",

            "content": "This show can be summed up pretty simply... horny virgin meets hot girls. but let's take it a little more seriously. Junichi and his friends are lonely perverts or at least his friends are. one they run into a gal which, to sum up for plot purposes are generally known for being easy sluts. His friends come up with the idea to volunteer him as tribute to ask one out. She says yes but it can't be that simply because anime. She is one of the pure ones and he has to work for it. now we watch as our perverted and lewd adventure unfolds.\r\nhonestly,i would rather watch Highschool DxD at this point because I get a little more from it for the fanservice is plot dynamic but it's fine. you can find juni's loyalty to the girl he approached just because he wanted sex a little odd but you can respect it as other opportunities come his way.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good. the bombastic breast is what you come to expect from a anime like this and the character designs are better than most considering what is. they use the gal thing to add more to the characters rather than what other shows do by having crazy hair and stuff because anime, I appreciate it. is it the best art you will ever see but its nice but I would prefer if they decide to go lewd to go all out instead of just using still-frames im not asking for hentai but i never like a still frame.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is nothing special. Nothing stands out to me to remember or to point on in a review. I think that means it at least not that bad because I would rant on that.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are...I don't really know. its kind of up and down for me. his friends are ... disturbing. we have the pedophile and the perverts that get off at any place and any time. The girls, on the other hand, are fairly dynamic instead of basic tropes of tsundere, kuudere... etc. since they are gals I guess they are all a little tsundere but the show presents them in a way that you're ok with that. they are fairly well written.  \\n\r\nLike I said earlier to return to the topic of the main character. I not sure how I feel about Juni's loyalty to his girlfriend. all he wanted to do was bone and was reluctant to even ask her out but when he gets his opportunity to bone other girls he doesn't and then fantasizes about boning again. I guess I want a little more consistency.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show isn't that good as much as I praise it. it has just as many up as it down not that I would go too much into the downs as i have a tendency to ramble. I give it a 4 or 5 out of 10. but you should at least check it out if you're looking for a watch. the good is worth at least a couple episodes.\\n",

Nevertheless, this show had a decent plot, characters, voices and overall it made me smile and get all giddy. Those were pros. The con was EVERYTIME I think they were gonna kiss or smash, it goes the opposite way. Its like my heart getting flustered and then breaking the next beat. I hate that shit. At least we get 1 kiss at the end. So look forward to that. If you wondering if this show is good, its alright. I wouldn't even callit a ecchi or a harem. Its the most PG harem ever. Holy shit. At least they let us see the goods in the uncensored version. God Bless.",
