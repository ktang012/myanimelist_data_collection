            "content": "No.6 is a captivating anime and I can honestly say that after having just watched it twice through. But then again, everyone has different tastes and this just may not be your cup of tea. Even so, it couldn\u2019t hurt to try a sip, could it?\r\nNOTE: For my sake, I\u2019m writing Nezumi, as Nezumi, and not \u201cRat\u201d like in the subs, and Shion instead of Sion, like the MAL character page. \r\nStory \u2013 8/10. No.6 is a utopia, there is no poverty, there are no conflicts, there are no problems. You will live happily and peacefully within these safe walls, and you will wear thislovely bracelet that is your identity. Oh, and one last thing: if you doubt us, we won\u2019t hesitate to eliminate you. Ignorance really is bliss. \\n\\n\r\nOn his 12th birthday, Shion hides and helps an injured Nezumi, a VC. This leads to being stripped of his rights to live in Cronos and qualification to enter the Special Course. There\u2019s a time skip, and suddenly it\u2019s four years later and instead of studying ecology, Shion\u2019s a park worker. After witnessing two people strangely die, he\u2019s taken away by the Bureau of Safety. At that point, he\u2019s rescued by Nezumi and whisked away to the Western District to discover the truth about No.6. \\n\\n\r\nNo.6 is listed as Sci-fi and Action, but there are also elements of Fantasy and Shounen-ai. Yes, shounen-ai. I\u2019m not sure if I view it as a good thing, or bad. I mean, I\u2019m a fan of yaoi/shounen-ai, so that probably contributes largely to the fact I enjoyed it, but I know there are a ton of people who aren\u2019t comfortable with it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a fan of shounen-ai, you will enjoy this. Well, to be honest, I\u2019m not sure it would be able to appeal to any other audience beside BL fans...\\n\\n\r\nAside from the homosexual content, No.6 starts off with an intriguing plot \u2013 and I won\u2019t lie, I\u2019m a total sucker for utopia/dystopia stories. But like a lot of people, I thought this had a lot of potential to be something amazing, but it never did reach what it could have; whether it\u2019s because of the length of the anime, or because it got side-tracked by shounen-ai fan service, I\u2019m not sure. I kind of feel like a lot of loose ends weren\u2019t dealt with. \\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 7.25/10. The art... isn\u2019t one of No.6\u2019s stronger points. While it isn\u2019t terrible, it isn\u2019t amazing. The characters are sometimes really awkwardly drawn/animated, such as Shion\u2019s scar or his blushing. But the background and scenery are amazing, and the OP was done beautifully. Especially the last thirty seconds.  \\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 9/10. I won\u2019t lie; I strongly disliked the OP at first. I thought it was really strange sounding and the singer\u2019s voice was abnormally high... but as the episodes went on, I\u2019ve grown to like them quite a bit. I found myself watching and listening to it on replay. Anyways, it suited the feel of No.6 perfectly. And ohmygosh, the ED. EDs are something I skip over all the time. Not this one. I couldn\u2019t. This one I liked right away. It felt incredibly sad, almost like nostalgia. As cheesy as this sounds, my heart clenches when I hear it. Background music was very subtle, but added wonderfully to the overall feel. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors also did a pretty good job. Nezumi\u2019s singing was nice... though, it took a bit of time getting used to little Shion\u2019s and little Nezumi\u2019s deep voices... \\n\\n\r\nCharacter \u2013 8/10. I cried. I got so emotionally attached, that tears came pouring out when Nezumi began singing in the last episode, despite how confused I was. \\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning you\u2019re introduced to 12-year-old Nezumi. Running around from authorities in what seems to be a sewage system, panting, with blood trickling down his arm. He meets a dead end, where steel bars are closing off on an opening, preventing chances of escape. Then you\u2019re introduced to 12-year-old Shion. Right away their lives are contrasted. Shion\u2019s sitting at his desk in the middle of Safu\u2019s presentation; there hasn\u2019t been any real hardships he\u2019s been through in life since being ranked as having highest intelligence. \\n\\n\r\nShion is naive, innocent, kind, and for the most part, ignorant like many other No.6 citizens. Nezumi is sharp-tongued, gives of an arrogant vibe, and is artsy.  Yes, their personalities have been done before, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get bored of them... Shion and Nezumi are actually quite likable. As the anime progresses, you see moments of complete contradiction to their personalities which I found quite interesting. Shion has a darker, more aggressive side that comes out when it comes to Nezumi, and Nezumi definitely has a soft spot when it comes to Shion. This might make them seem out of character at times, but I think that\u2019s the point. They bring out entirely new sides of each other.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other supporting characters: Karan, Inukashi, Rikiga, even Yoming, \u2013 they\u2019re pretty okay. You know general information about their life and their past, but not in great detail. They\u2019re not exactly incredibly developed characters either, but the anime was only 11 episodes long.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only one I found kind of strange was Elyurias/Safu. I didn\u2019t really understand her presence or character...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 10/10. I enjoyed this 10/10 easily, even the second time going through. I grinned and I worried, I eagerly clicked each episode and got frustrated over waiting for the next one. With this anime, I watched it each episode from beginning to end, OP to ED. Stating it simply: I loved watching it [and rewatching it.] The last episode did confuse me a bit, but I\u2019m seriously longing for more. \\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 Each category is weighted differently for me, and of course, there are always miscellaneous factors. I consider Story to account for 25% of the overall ranking of animes, Art 10%, Sound 10%, Character 25%, and Enjoyment 30%.  \\n\\n\r\nSo, then:\\n\r\n[80% x 0.25] + [72.5% x 0.10] + [90% x 0.10] + [80% x 0.25] + [100% x 0.30] = 86.25%\\n\\n\r\nRound it up, and that\u2019s how No.6 gets a 9/10 from me... and my first review on MAL. ^_______^ \\n",

            "content": "Wow, that was painful. Please, anyone reading this, don't bother with this anime. Go pick up a translation of the novels or the manga. I've only read brief summaries of the novel, but those summaries were enough to let me know how good of a show this could have been, and just how far BONES had to go out of its way to make the No. 6 anime a complete trainwreck. \r\nThe first three episodes of the show were really interesting. Not fantastic, but enough to get me excited. There's a strong sense of mystery pervading the first episode: Why is this kid being pursued?What's that thing in the center of the city making a strange noise, one that causes those that hear it to listen in seeming awe and reverence? The second episode continues to add questions, while starting up the plot proper as prettyboy Nezumi helps hero Shion escape No. 6 before Shion can be taken to the Ministry of Love. Excuse me, I meant the Correctional Facility. The third episode gives us our look outside the city, so we can see a town built from freedom and poverty, distinct from the strict control of the supposed utopia beyond the walls. At the end of episode 3, Nezumi, who has stated his disgust at No. 6, promises to reveal to Shion why he hates Shion's former home, and why Shion should too.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then episode 4 comes, and we get nothing. Then episode 5 comes, and we get nothing. Episode 6? Nope. Episode 7? Still nothing. The show spins its wheels for four episodes, and Nezumi and Shion's interactions in each episode can be summed up like this:\\n\\n\r\nNezumi: I hate No. 6! I want to destroy it!\\n\r\nShion: Why?\\n\r\nNezumi: I'll tell you later!\\n\r\nShion: I love you, Nezumi.\\n\r\nNezumi: I hate you because you love No. 6!\\n\r\nShion: Why should I hate it?\\n\r\nNezumi: I'll tell you later!\\n\\n\r\nAnd so on. Eventually, something happens that causes them to actually decide to get off their asses and finally do something. This is episode 8. There are only 3 episodes left after this. They spend this episode seeing a guy who helped build the city, and getting answers from him. Why Nezumi didn't take Shion to him as soon as possible and keep the plot going is beyond me. We do learn some very important things this episode, though! Namely, the government of No. 6 is actually... evil! This was in no way obvious based on the previous seven episodes, and is a giant shock to everybody. We also learn about something called Elyurias, but what that actually is isn't explained yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe next bit will be a bit spoilerish. It shouldn't be too hard to guess the basics of what happens, but if you're really picky about avoiding spoilers you'll want to skip ahead, or stop reading and go do something that isn't watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe final three episodes end by showing a staggering display of incompetence by every single character and organization in the show (save for one, although that character is basically lucky). Nezumi and Shion infiltrate the Correctional Facility by the dumbest luck ever. Had things gone slightly not their way, they would have died instantly the second they entered the building. They wouldn't know where they should even be going in this place if it wasn't for a magic voice inside Shion's head. The guards of the supposedly secure facility are dispatched with ease by the two infiltrators. And then when Shion and Nezumi finally get to where they were going, the person they were trying to save has freed herself just fine thanks to the previously-mentioned magic voice. A resistance movement within No. 6 tries to do something, but they just kinda set off some bombs and talk to no one in particular. Random eco-magic destroys No. 6, everyone who survived is happy, or something. We don't learn much of anything, and just when we think we might we get a huge slap in the face for thinking that we should know what the hell we just watched.\\n\\n\r\nThose of you who pay close attention to the plot may notice that nothing Shion and Nezumi do actually affects it. They don't destroy No. 6, they don't save the West District, they don't save the person they were supposed to save, they don't save the innocents in No. 6 from the danger they're in. (The last one in particular was what Shion really focused on trying to do, before the show forgot that he was supposed to do that.) Everything that the heroes try to accomplish is done for them, and had Shion and Nezumi not been in the show, the plot would have been exactly the same. (I suppose there's one thing Nezumi does to help take down No. 6 at the very end, but nothing in the anime canon is preventing the one person who actually did anything useful from doing that as well. There's a reason for it in the manga, but the anime contradicts that reason.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was just as teasing as the plot. Sure, the relationship between Shion and Nezumi was cute, and the world needs more romances that don't make a big deal about the gender of the participants, but it didn't go much of anywhere. We'd watch Shion and Nezumi say the same things, and maybe kiss a couple times. It goes over better than the plot, since at least you know what's going on between the two, but still, it could have progressed a lot faster and gone a lot deeper. (I'd bet Nezumi would not have any problems going really deep into Shion's... feelings.)\\n\\n\r\nAt least the art looked nice, and the music wasn't so weird as to be completely distracting. I think that I'll probably remember the music most fondly, not because it was particularly amazing, but just because it was really strange. Also, Safu is the best character and I wish she'd be in the show more. (Apparently she has an expanded role in the anime compared to the novels, and considering how little she's involved in the anime...) Unfortunately, that isn't nearly enough to make this worth anyone's time, not when you could be reading the novels. Or Brave New World. Or 1984. Or watching Steins;Gate. Or Lucky Star. Or Blue's Clues. (At least you got to know the answers to the mystery at the end of each episode.)\\n\\n\r\n(Update: Someone informed me that No. 6 is considered to be a novel, not a light novel. I've changed that up above. I've seen conflicting information about this, though, but this change hopefully will still make sense. If it doesn't, just pretend I said 'book' each time I said 'novel'. If that still doesn't work for you, replace it with whatever you want.)",

            "content": "Had so much potential but was wasted. When I saw the first episode I fell in love with the characters and became very interested in the story. I was so glad this wasn't one of those animes where you had to watch up until episode 4 or 5 before something good happens. It started right out with some action and character development.\r\nWatching the next batch of episodes had me hooked because there was so many things going on with Shion and Nezumi, both apart and together, plus the background of No. 6 and how it got the way it is. The horrible acts committed bythem et al. I thought I was in for a good treat. And on top of it all, the two male characters were falling in love, not just some boy love teasers some animes throw out to bait Yaoi fans into watching. I've always wanted to watch an action anime where the male leads fall for each other but it isn't a drama or romance show. Mirage of Blaze is the only other anime I can think of that was action and yaoi. So I was on cloud nine.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, somewhere along the way the show lost focus and had no idea what it was going to do with the characters or the No.6 city itself. It begins to trip and falter and just does not know how to pick itself up. The characters essentially become cardboard cut outs and just placed in scenes and seem to not really do anything. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, Shion and Nezumi seem to have conflict about their viewpoints on how No. 6 should be handled with people dying. Nezumi wishes to destroy the city while Shion wants to save the people. Yet neither character does anything about it. Then the writers tried to focus on the female character (I forgot her name) the girl who was in love with Shion. But they have no idea what to even do with her by this point, it's just her walking around thinking about Shion, then when she decides to do something she gets taken.\\n\\n\r\nSo I'm thinking, fine, I guess this will cause Shion to act and maybe cause some tension between he and Nezumi. And they do act by going to save her. Meanwhile, the story takes a whole new focus on these forest people and alluding to the girl and Nezumi having a connection. But this goes NO WHERE! \\n\\n\r\nThe connection between Shion's mother being one of the creators of No.6 goes NO WHERE\\n\r\nThe Radical group who wants to take down No. 6 from the inside, goes NO WHERE\\n\r\nFinding out why or how No.6 turned out the way it did, goes NO WHERE\\n\\n\r\nI tried to figure out what was happening here with this show that started out so good and the only thing I got is that the show lacked a human villain. When you have a city or institution as the villain, having a personification of the city would help. After all who is behind the city? Who is the one giving the orders for these terrible acts to take place? Sure Nezumi and Shion are fighting against the city, but who is the one they have to beat? Who does the radical group have to go after to free themselves of No.6?\\n\\n\r\nNo one??\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, the writers try to solve this glaring issue by making the girl who loves Shion into a magical forest goddess that they have to beat. *eye roll* \\n\r\nThen at the ending when everything seems so bleak the girl transforms into a large magical bee and destroys the city walls with bee tornado for Shion because having him do it himself would take more episodes than they were willing to write. She also grants instant life with her LGBT rainbow powers then float away with her magical bees.\\n\\n\r\nYes an action Scifi post apocalyptic anime transforms into a fantasy magical anime at the end.  \\n\r\n*headache*\\n\\n\r\nBy this time I am just watching for Shion and Nezumi's love story. But I'm given NOTHING but a second kiss on the lips and the characters deciding to part ways for unexplained reasons.  Honestly, I would had been better off just watching the first episode and just using my own imagination to come up with what happens. \\n",

            "content": "Seemed to be lacking in reviews, so decided for me to write my own.\r\nFirstly, although only four episodes in, there are some definite Shonen Ai hints. We still have some more episodes to go before it is confirmed, but it is most definitely on the cards. So do not watch if you aren't into that kind of thing. If not, do try this, it makes for interesting character (and comical) interaction and relationship. (Sometimes even married couple like)\r\nNow onto the main story, set in the near future in a Dystopia. (Google is your friend) Which follows Sion and Nezumi(Rat)'s story that investigates the mysteries ofan area inside the Dystopia called NO.6. I will not go into the story too much, as I will just be repeating the synopsis already on here and on the other reviews. Though I will say that it is worth it to bare with the slow-ish episodes- It will undoubtedly pick up. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty, like all bones series, the opening is pretty to look at. At first I hated the song choice, but it has started to grow on me, although I wouldn't listen to it actively on on Ipod. The ending I find much better and was perfect for the mood in the last scene of episode 4 and I have a feeling it will be used at some point again in the same way. Background music is good and used appropriately. Nothing special, but adds to the scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe contrast between the two characters is clear from the start and the opening does a great job at portraying this. Well done Bones! The relationship between the two characters and the plot both seem to be of equal importance. What I like best is the realisticness of the two main characters, especially Nezumi's. This is rare and I find it quite refreshing. Although Sion's character can come across as irritating at points. A third notable character is Safu, Sion's female best friend, who you could say is his heterosexual love interest who is in love with him. Who I don't personally take to nor does she contribute much to the series thus so far. Interested to see if this changes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is pretty high surprisingly. It is unlike most series you will come across and although I don't see it becoming the next smash-hit anime. It is a unique anime which is different from all the mainstream animes you have seen cloned many time. And the Shonen Ai subcontext adds to the story in a way that most Anime shy away from. Good for you, no.9! I will be watching to see how the series progresses. And so should you. Now, go watch! :)!",

            "content": "Firstly, No. 6 is very homotastic.  It`s a fact.  But to anyone who may be discouraged by the not-very-subtle homosexuality, I advise that you keep watching.  Whether or not you like the overt man-love that erupts between Nezumi and Sion (who, oddly, resemble a certain pair of characters from D.Gray Man who get a lot of Yaoi attention as well), getting past it will reveal an intriguing, thought-provoking plot.  Given, it is just like any utopian anime in concept - Nuclear War, bla bla bla, Utopia that turns out to not be Utopia.  Yet, No. 6 does not suffer fromthat.  In fact, thus far, it has provoked as much thought as 1984 and Farenheit 451, the masterpieces of Utopian/dystopian novels.  Moreover, No. 6 performs its characterization exceptionally.  The relationship between Sion and Nezumi aside, the stories of each of its characters (Karan, Sion`s mother; the as of yet enigmatic Yomin/Yoming; Safu, the poor girl who has yet to realize that her love, Sion, now looks like Allen Walker and has already been claimed by a bishounen crossdressing actor) are weaved with the skill of a starving Gandhi on the spinning wheel in a British Prison.  The music and art are nothing spectacular (but in no way deficient), but No. 6 is one anime that succeeds in running on plot alone.  Though there is a strong element of shounen ai, No.6 doesn`t attempt to sell itself on the homosexuality, and in fact goes about it in a serious and mature fashion (I don`t mean mature as in the Movie Rating - quite the opposite, in fact).  There are no not-so-subtle harems, very few coincidences that end up with Sion sprawled over Nezumi  (or vice versa) in suggestive positions and no clothes on and no conveniently intriguing animation - in fact, there is very little sexuality in the relationship between Sion and Nezumi (until the last episode, at which it becomes blatantly obvious).  No. 6 sells itself on plot, and I would say it is definitely worth buying.  So leave aside what biases you may have knowing it might be a little fabulous, and just go with it, and you might find yourself pleasantly surprised.\\n\\n\r\n=Edit/Update=\\n\\n\r\nHaving watched the last episode, I am a little bit disappointed in No.6, perhaps simply on account of the ending.  Though the last episode hastily ties up most of the plot points to a watchable conclusion, it fails to truly explain some of the story background, such as the exact nature of No.6, the role of Sion`s mother Karan, the exact purposes and extent of the resistance led by Yoming (and whether, given this is a fansub, is actually his name) and who in god`s name the Forest Blokes are.  At the end of the road, it seems as if the destination was not worth the journey.  As an anime with only 11 episodes, there is some reason to forgive No. 6 for its rushed ending and the inability to tie out many plot points, but it`s still a little disappointing to see a story that had great, great potential end up merely good.  I wouldn`t say it renders No. 6 unwatchable, but it prevents it from reaching its full potential.",

            "content": "The story of no. 6 is set in a post apocalyptic earth, where humans are divided into 6 cities, and the one that is focused on is number 6, hence the title. So far, so good right? We have a story that occurs outside of a high school for once. Throw a few dystopian elements in, and it immediately looks like something worth watching. Not to mention, no. 6 is animated by studio Bones, the people behind FMA: Brotherhood. So why do I not enjoy this nearly as much as similar animes?\r\nLet\"s take a closer look.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nJust a fair warning, this is not an animefor people who cannot stand shounen ai. Not that it's a vital piece to the story or anything, but there are still some moments that might turn you off if you don't enjoy that kind of romance.\\n\\n\r\nSo here's the story. Sion, our protagonist, was a young, promising student. On the night of his 12th birthday, he met a fleeing fugitive, Nezumi. Despite knowing that he would be punished by the law, hid and helped him escape. Four years later, after witnessing a strange event at work, he was taken away by the police and was rescued by Nezumi and the two of them ran to the outside world that the walls of no. 6 was trying to hide from its inhabitants.\\n\r\nAfter putting so much of drama in the opening episodes of the show, you would think that the creators would then try to maintain the audience's attention right? Wrong. The remainder of No.6 is then used to explain side characters that you would never care about, raises conflicts that would just disappear not to ever return. Maybe it's because of how short this series is, but that does not cover up for the fact that there are many episodes that just waste time building up to a good development, and then completely forgets about it next week. I've find myself wanting to drop no. 6 because of that.  It is not until near the end of the show when things are finally explained and the plot moves on. However, by the time that happens, we're already on the last few episodes and there's no room left to truly establish a good motive or villain.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the character design is not very outstanding, Studio Bones does do a very good job of animating No. 6. The few actions scenes are worth watching and they do make the show a lot more enjoyable. Of course, this is not FMA, but it is fun looking at Nezumi beating the crap out of some random grunt.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic is perhaps No. 6 worst aspect. The op and ed are fine, and I rather enjoyed them, but the BGM is bad to say the least and some tracks just simply fails to deliver a good moment. That is not very annoying in through out most of the anime since nothing really happens, but when things really heat up later on, don't expect shivers to run down your spine because of the epic music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentions before, the side characters of this show are not very interesting. Although No.6 does try to give the audience something to relate to them, there's not very much to grasp onto as they are only given a few minutes of back story at best before being thrown into the plot device closet again. Where the show really shines is the interaction between Nezumi and Sion and that's what made me stick around. I'm not going to reveal a lot of it here since I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but I'm going to say that through their interactions, they grow a lot together and character development is always very appreciated in my book.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show was recommended to me by a friend who was praising it a lot, and I could see why. Does that mean I enjoy it as much as she did? Unfortunately no. Despite having potential, No. 6 just falls short of many other brethren of the same genre, and the music did not help a lot either.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't watch a lot of anime in the scifi or dystopia genre, you might find No.6 a refreshing deviation from your typical high school anime. It has a decent plot, and overall solid leads. However, if you're the type that could talk about Ergo Proxy, Psycho Pass, etc. for days on end, this title might be a bit lack luster for you. Despite that however, No. 6 does manage to pull itself through in the end. Is it an anime that you must watch before you kick the bucket? No. But is it a good way to spend a boring Saturday afternoon? Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let's just start this off by saying: wow. Honestly.. just wow. I've seen 10 episodes, so I know what I'm talking about. \r\nStory:\r\nThe story itself is okay. The thought behind it is intriguing, but the way they've told it, the way they've progressed.. it's just absolutely horrible. \"best security ever\" is all they discuss for 3 episodes long, and when they finally infiltrate, they are all able to walk by freely. A hallway with 30 people in, someone asks you something, you punch them in the stomach, and then are able to get away without someone noticing? Yeah. Okay. \r\nArt and sound: \r\nThe art isokay. A bit dodgy at some points, but overall okay. The sound is great as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWow. Okay, here we go. The characters are inconsistent. Inconsistent to the point where you just want to tear your eyeballs out of frustration. \\n\\n\r\nMain:\\n\\n\r\nShion:\\n\r\nHe started off as a naive little kid, always seeing the positive side to things. It got a bit creepy when another kid, about his age, grabbed him from behind and pulled a knife to his throat. All he could do was laugh, smile, and not be terrified. \\n\r\nLater on, after the wasp bite, he manages to keep his positive side, even though he's really an unguided missile. \\n\\n\r\nNezumi:\\n\r\nThis guy.. wow. If there'd truly be a Kira, he'd be at the top of the list. Never seen someone deceive so many people, enjoy it, and later on cry about it when alone in bed. Imagine asking someone for help by entering their bedroom doors from the outside, only to put up a knife to the kids throat. \\n\r\nImagine saying \"fuck you\", \"i wont help you even as you die\", \"your mom was a stinky old dog\", and then later on to say \"ill help you always\". No sorry's, just this. \\n\r\nHe hates Shion, but yet, has developed romantic feelings for him. If I knew this were to be a ecchi series, I'd never have started. This guy goes from killing someone in cold blood, to making sure his clothes don't get dirty, to avoid killing someone at all costs. He makes no sense. None of the characters do though.\\n\\n\r\nInukashi: \\n\r\nThis woman hates everything in the entire world, and yet, loves everything that she owns. \"Go fuck yourself and die\" seems to be the attitude she has. Going after Nezumi when he's walking alone, accompanied by her dogs, she wants to tear him apart. Even though they're actually good friends. See how it doesn't make sense? \\n\\n\r\nSide:\\n\r\nRikiga. This guy must have been a pervert, and therefore placed outside of No. 6. There is no other explanation. \\n\r\nYouming. This guy seems like he wants to help, yet, only later shows his real intentions. Raping, killing and misleading the one he wanted to help. \\n\r\nSafu. Good girl. Bit weird to ask for a guy's semen only if the girl's.. what? 14-15? \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nDon't bother watching. It goes to such extremes. From not hurting a fly to shooting someone in the head whilst they are lying on the floor begging for their lives. Note that I'm talking about the same character in both scenarios. I've yet to see more shittier characters than this anime does. If you feel I'm wrong in any way, feel free to contact me. I'd love to spread more hate about this anime. \\n\\n\r\nGood god, please go watch something worthwhile. I will be finishing this, only because I don't like loose ends.",

If you are the  type of person that , like many i know, watch anime in the background  while doing other things and just look close when things blow up... dont bother with this one. You will miss details and not get the big picture and small subplots and it will seem boring.\r\nYes not much action in the middle episodes, and yes some characters on a first look might just seem filling. But if you look closer it's not so.\r\nThis isn't an action anime. It actually addresses manyissues about what is is to be human, how we can evolve or not, how we make our own place in the world and most importantly how we deal and interact with others that come into our lives even for just a few minutes...\\n\\n\r\nI also see nothing wrong with the ending, I thought it was magnificent.\\n\r\nAnd i strongly disagree with the comment that Nezumi and Shion had no effect on the outcome. Quite the contrary, in my interpretation what they did and said in the machine room changed what was going to happen and all episodes (how meaningless they seem to some ) build the interactions and feelings of all the characters in that scene, in that moment.",

            "content": "No. 6 is probably one of the most publicised anime of the Summer 2011 season, for this reason only:\r\nThe two characters are supposedly gaybones for each other.\r\nNo. 6 is a beautifully animated series by Studio Bones, who also gave us Full Metal Alchemist and Soul Eater. It is based on a series of light novels and should be known for its literary allusions and dystopian undertones. However, though the potential for an intelligent sci-fi anime is there, it is never fully realised.\r\nEven in the light novels the plot seems rather dodgy, indecisive on whether it wants to focus on mythology or science as a basisfor the series. As such it is an awkward blend of both, which is similar in its effectiveness as trying to force two like-poles of a magnet together. \\n\\n\r\nThis is the telling fault line in the foundation of the entire premise, and it is not alone. The stereotypical image of a sci-fi fan, wearing their Star Trek uniform and watching Babylon 5, does not meld well with the idea of romance, let alone boys' love, in general; especially as what romantic interaction there is between the two mains feels wedged in as an afterthought. While the original novels integrated the romance in alongside the development of the plot - making this a case of adaption decay - it is still ultimately these conflicting ideas that weaken the show at its heart. If the series leaned more towards a more mythical slant I believe that what shounen-ai there is would have been melded into the plot a lot more naturally, as historically mythology has never been shy of contraversial pairings between its characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is rather badly adapted overall: this is one if those shows you have to read up on to understand exactly what has happened. Possibly this is a case of the show being compressed so much, but after reading the summary of the last volume (which I can't recommend enough - http://hiriajuu.livejournal.com/7568.html) it seems that Studio Bones apparently, like many of the characters, had a stroke, and decided to make shit up. Overall the gaps are too great for the average viewer to try and guess what's going on, and the composition of the series feels very inconsistent episode to episode. It just left me with a slightly annoyed feeling afterwards. However, if you're a softcore sci-fi fan or hardcore BL nerd with the imagination to fill in the gaps, perhaps this won't be much of an issue for you.\\n\\n\r\nWhereas the characters themselves are compelling, in theory, (the dreamy boy genius, exiled tsundere with a ponytail, as well as a journalist-turned-pimp and a dogkeeper whose gender you will spend more time pondering than the actual intricacies of the plot), but in practice the characterisation is inconsistent and at sometimes enough to make you wonder if the characters have had strokes. One minute Nezumi and Sion are getting along fine, the next they're arguing, the next they're...dancing?\\n\\n\r\nThough there is the fan emphasis on the shounen-ai elements, if you go into this show on that merit alone, you will be sorely disappointed. Though there are one or two signs of affection between the two male leads, Nezumi and Sion, as a romance it is sorely unfulfilling and as mentioned before, the motivations of the two are unclear at best and agonizingly OOC at worst. The ending, without giving any spoilers, doesn't improve on anything.  \\n\\n\r\nBut not all is terrible about this show. The voice acting is quite good; notably, Sion's seiyuu does a fantastic job at tormented screams of pain. The other character's voices fit them well and I have no qualms here. \\n\\n\r\nThe saving grace of this series is the animation: it is stunningly pretty. The character designs are unique enough, but it is the backgrounds that are truly beautiful. Especially detailed are the iconic buildings, representing the cold, steeled nature of the city itself. \\n\\n\r\nThe music used was atmospheric and appropriate for the scene, as were the opening and ending songs, though the ending animation felt rather out-of-place and as the series went on, I began to openly resent its abrupt intrusion into the story. I really enjoyed the croaky vocals of the OP and would probably download it to listen to; the rest, not so much. \\n\\n\r\nMany people will watch this series and, much as I did earlier, pontificate on if, why and how shounen-ai /BL/homosexuality belongs in a sci-fi setting. So it is ironic that No. 6's biggest weakness is the same as science fiction's greatest shortcoming. \\n\\n\r\nNo. 6's biggest defect is not the huge gaps in storytelling nor the compression of source material to fit it into five and a half hours of anime - though these are glaring - but the fact that, ultimately, No. 6 feels cold. As cold the metallic buildings and swathes of blue we see in the very first moments of the opening; as cold as the hearts of the people that run the city. Though the characters were smart, cute, at times funny, I felt no emotional connection to them after the show ended. The question is not, 'can sci-fi be gay too?' but 'can sci-fi cultivate a romance, of any orientation? Can sci-fi make me emphathise with the characters even if there is a complicated plot and futuresque setting?' \\n\\n\r\nFor No. 6, the answer is no.",

The beginning, and the end. Last time when I reviewed this anime were when I was done watching episode 7, and by then I realized that this anime was lacking of action and interest. between episode 4 an 8 it was very minimal action happening in this anime. The only thing I was excited about by then was when Safu was captured, and after when they started to rescuing her, I was more revealedthat the excitement finally was back and it actually happened something\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning really took up inportant parts like how Sion and Nezumi met, and how they met again years afterwards. Although for me it was kinda confusing to hang on in the first two episodes. Especially if you did it just like I did: Watched the teaserphoto (thet one with Sion and Nezumi), then I was like \"Where is the whitehaired guy?\" but later on I got things clear to me and could follow the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending really made me a bit sad because of the terrible happenings, but later on near the ending it seemed like it really went fine. But still I really wonder why Nezumi suddenly left Sion. Couldn't they be together even though they succeeded with their mission? And then I really wanted to see many after-scenes like when Sion and his mom finally meets which we never see them do.\\n\\n\r\nSummaringly. The beginning and the ending is really great (except about the named parts), but the middle... It was really unnecessary I gotta say. Nezumi and Sion is repeating the same questions to each other, and they never get an answer, which can be pretty irritating. But otherwise, I don't regret watching this anime.",

Two boys join forces to discover the truth about about the city, as well as themselves. \r\nAs you can see,what we deal with is a dystopian society - perfect at first glimpse, but rotten at the core. On the other side we have people living ouside the city - animals spending their lives in the slums. At that point No. 6 breaks typical sci-fi convention - in films like Equilibrium or Book of Eli, those who oppose the system are good, almost bleached out guys. In No.6, it's the choice between being happy, but manipulated, or constantly in danger, but free. \\n\r\nSion and Nezumi spend their days in the latter part of the world. Surrounded by violence, rape and filth the're getting more and more drawn to each other. \\n\\n\r\nThis way we got to the strongest part of the show - character developemet. Both boys are sensitive and inteligent, as a contrast to a harsh world surrounding them. Still, it's not flat. Nezumi, natural-born badass, likes poetry (if you like finding tropes in anime, you'll be in heaven). Sion, a full-heart pacifist and humanist can punch a guy in the face. Besides, Nezumi confronting Sion is a big clash of ideologies. It's really great to watch as they try to explain each other their point of view, and how the other one reacts. Both of them, treir relationship, how certain things slowly change their personality, is a piece of well done, deep character developement. \\n\r\nNot to mention solid, interesting bacground characters. \\n\\n\r\nArt, Sound and Setting\\n\\n\r\nThere is not much of \"music\" in No. 6. Soundtracks played in background are not someting that touch your heart and makes you think \"I love that track! Need to hear it more!\" but they create the atmosphere nicely. However, I have to mention beautiful elegies sung by several characters. Quality of art in the show is good, there are scenes with bad animation, but sudden drop of quality between highly appealing scenes is something common in recent anime's. The overal look of characters is nice to watch, and bg are rich. \\n\r\nAs or the setting, some scenes, like dialouges, ale played flawless, which is great for a series full of it, but other scenes seem to be a little bit too rushed (especially most lyrical ones). I think that is beacuse the series is too short, and director still tried to make it a little bit more metaphisical. \\n\\n\r\nNo. 6 was great, touching story to watch. It gets strange at the end, but still I highly reccomend to watch it.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The past few seasons of Noitamina titles seem to have a trend going on: have one title down-to-earth with its storyline offering good quality plotting and characterization within its 11 episode length (Hourou Musuko and Ano Hana) while the other title features a grand-scale plot which while slick in presentation, has too much within its series to properly convey a well laid-out plot that explores its world due to limited episode count (Fractale and C). The Summer 2011 season continues the trend with the grand-scale plot series coming in the form of No. 6. The series appears to be portraying a dystopian society where thedesirable people within its populace are nurtured and intentionally left in the dark about the true reality of the world around them. Shion finds himself becoming aware of this reality as he interacts with the mysterious rogue known as Nezumi which costs the former his desirable status in the said mentioned society.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing to this series is already looking fairly rushed as time already skips ahead several years following the first episode and the pace in which Shion flees from the city he lived in gives you little breathing room to get any sense of the world within and outside the city Shion had lived in. Thus far, I get the feel this is turning out to be a cookie-cutter dystopian title in the same vain as Fractale yet with a darker and rougher edge to it. Like Fractale and C, the visuals thus far are of great quality with clean details and subdued color shades to convey the dark mood the series gives off. While action hasn't been so prominent thus far, the show does have its moments of fluid animation seen from Nezumi dealing with the Men in Black as he gets Shion out of the city.\\n\\n\r\nWith how No. 6 has turned out thus far, I'm not too confident in saying I'll get any anticipation out of seeing what happens next with Shion and Nezumi in this anime if this series is geared only for an 11-episode run limiting the amount of time the series can put into exploring its elements. I'm dropping this series at this point and hope that Noitamina can cut it with this routine of offering one down-to-earth series that works well within its episode count and another that has too much to squeeze into 11 episodes.",

It's so well written and so inspiring that when I started to watch the anime I had such high hopes especially after reading a few of the light novel volumes as well as the manga, however I was a bit disappointed in the outcome. I wouldn't say that the anime was all that bad, it was enjoyable, the Japanese voice actors were absolutely amazing (dubbed version is horrible don't watch that) and that's what really kept me going until the very end and of course the story of Shion and Nezumi. It's very facepaced and it leaves a lot of be desired in the end. Personally I think it could have been better if they gave it 12 or 13 episodes just to tie some loose ends for people who haven't read the novels or manga, unfortunately we were given an eleven episode rush job. It's not the type of story that needs twenty four episodes but and extra one or two would have made a difference. Aside from that the art work, music, and characters were very well done. I suggest to anyone who wants to watch this or who has watched it already to please please please read the manga or download the light novel's online. You won't be disappointed and you can get a lot more out of that than the anime itself!",

Despite all the negative reviews, I felt the story flowed so nicely that as soon as the ending song started I frequently caught myself in surprise thinking \"what? already?\". \r\nMain themes are contrasts, knowledge/ignorance, dreams/reality. Inside the narrative, though, there is a lot of refreshingly progressive turns. There are strong, feisty intelligent girls interested in sex, there are strong emotional relationships regardless of gender and time, there are people in sync with animals,and there is clear character development. I was hooked, and I can't wait to read the manga.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed Psychopass and Guilty Crown before landing on No.6, and I do think it is a good series for any fan of dystopian sci-fi.",

I've been off this site for a while, but once I watched the first episode of this, II wanted to make sure everyone knew how great it was. I wanted to give it a ten on the spot overall, but rating an entire series on the first episode is stupid. \r\nNo. 6 has everything I've been currently looking for in an anime. It has Josei, or it seems, kinda like Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, but on a Skyblue scale. \r\nIt has adventure, but not in the \"Quest Factor\" but more like the \"Slice of Life\" introductoryjourney into full scale investigation, like Monster.\\n\r\nI'm hoping it's Seinen, it may make or break the show, but Deadman Wonderland has done fabulously, and I would like to see this flourish as well.\\n\r\nRomance is a good one. Or at least romantic tension. It gives me various mixed feelings while watching.\\n\r\nMystery/Tragedy/Conspiracy are my hooks. They do so much for the plot that all I want to do is skip work and stare at the glowing screen until a new episode airs.\\n\\n\r\nI want to take a second to compliment the art and music combo. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is so spectular, especially when you watch in HD like I do. The colors are beautifully vivid, especially the night scene with the typhoon. That was gorgeous. And the music compliments so well. It sets a mellow tone through the whole first episode, so you know that you're gonna have to fasten the straps on your emotional rollercoater car. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I'm going to be watching this until the end, no messing around with other things. This is a priority and I'm gonna make damn sure to get that freaking watch of Shion's!!!!",

The concept of the future in the show is not totally new (beautiful cities with dark secrets and displaced towns on the outside of its walls) but still intriguing.\r\nWhat makes the show is the main story and the characters. Off the bat, the two main characters show that a complex, turbulent but genuine relationship will form. Other characters introduced in the show are also fascinating with strange dynamics between them. I would have liked to know more about the world of the show.Like most future dystopian stories, there are things you want to know that both drive you crazy but also make the world even more fascinating. What No. 6 did right is focus on the story and characters so that you I didn't feel dissatisfied with the mysteries left behind.\\n\\n\r\nThe technical quality of the show is good but not the best.

For a start, I think the two mains are incredibly likable, and very contrasting. Nezumi, who even though is very serious at times has plenty of other moments that make his character charming and funny. Especially his interactions with the rather naive Sion.\r\nThe only character I really didn't like was the girl counterpart, Safu, although, one of her lines earlier into the anime had me laughing my head off.\r\nThe plot is also really fantastic, therewere many times when I was watching this that I became very emotionally; to the point of kicking and shrieking to then cheering and jumping about my room excitedly. Well done story!\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyus were also amazing, I found myself falling in love with their voices, especially Nezumi's, which was deliciously sexy. Not to mention his Seiyu also has an drool worthy singing voice too.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song, well when I first heard it, I was turning my nose up at it a little, but after a couple of times of hearing it, it really grew on me!\\n\\n\r\nThe art was also lovely, everything extremely well drawn. Yes, the two mains look a lot like Kanda Yuu and Allen Walker from D.Gray-man. Even if they do, I would never see the two mains as ripoffs. Though I would understand if people thought Allen and Sion shared a lot more than just looks, they have very similar motives. However still, I think Sion has got enough going to stand out as an individual character and not an Allen Walker lookalike.\\n\\n\r\nThe shounen-ai type theme also that ran along side the story, I thought was an added bonus, but that's just my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this anime, it's been ages since I've actually watched anime in fact.So i'm glad this is the one that's started me going again. As of right now, i'm recommending it to my friends, via fangirl attack.\\n",

I mean for some scenes it's exceptional, but other than that it's kind of amateurish. but don't let that distract you from the story line, anybody could mess up on animation. \\n\\n\r\nthe soundtrack was pretty good. it went pretty well with the anime and was just ok in general. and honestly, the opening is my favourite song for the whole anime. even though it starts off absolutely amazing, but then goes into this kind of high pitched squealing we have to pretend is singing. i'm not saying the music is bad, it's just, not so much the kind of music you would see with such a good plot.\\n\\n\r\nas for the characters...Nezumi x Shion.....I ship them, and I bet mst of you who've seen the anime will too. pfft, Safu and Shion, please. but that's not the point. the point is, the background stories fit the characters amazingly. and it seems they could be based on people in real life. \\n\\n\r\noverall, this anime is one you would not regret watching. even if the genres don't make it seem like something you would watch, you should definitely watch anyway. you won't be disappointed.",

It aspires to be a post apocalyptic dystopian adventure, a corrupted-regime-fighting character study with a dash of yaoi and some inexplicably mystical deus ex machina as topping. It all makes as much sense as divining the future from my cat\u2019s furballs. \r\nStory:\r\nStupidly naive boy is kicked out of an artificial paradise city, lives with a pretty bad-boy in a refugee ghetto. Confusing situations ensue.\r\nThe story is all over the place. It spends too much time on things that are proven to be unimportant in the end, ituses cheap tricks and gimmicks and leaves behind a plot so ridden with holes it feels like eating Swiss cheese. I kind of wonder, what sort of audience is this aimed at? It has far too little yaoi to appeal to the boys\u2019 love club. It is not nearly science fiction-y enough to appeal to the scifi buffs. It has too little action to classify as a typical shonen. \\n\r\nFrankly, I was bored most of the time. I did exercise my mind by pointing out the logical inconsistencies so that must count for something, like fighting against Alzheimer's in my old age. Also, it does not help that we have a faceless sort of threatening enemy doing largely illogical things like trashing the refugees' slum city, taking prisoners, driving them to prison and then executing them. I mean, why not just kill them then and there? My brain, it hurts.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nMost anime who fail the story test can still reclaim some viewing enjoyment from well fleshed out characters. Not so here.\\n\r\nShion is supposed to be the main character but he is so frigging useless I kind of wonder why are all the other characters so enamoured of him. I get it, he is supposed to be the embodiment of kindness and altruism in a jaded society so that he draws others in like a white light. In theory. In practice he is so annoyingly stupid I really wanted to put his head to the meat grinder and feed him to my cat.\\n\r\nNezumi is the bad boy who rescues him\u2014and the love interest, you should know. For 2/3 of the anime he is the standard \u201cabusive attractive asshole\u201d. Hey, at least he does interesting stuff and he's not stupid\u2014much. \\n\r\nSafu is Shion\u2019s childhood friend and has a crush on him. Hmm, looks like someone didn't get the memo. Safu the beard spends a lot of time mooning over her love that never was and in the end proves to be a plot device. \\n\r\nOf all the other secondary characters\u2014who are all as useful to the plot as a third leg\u2014I mostly liked the Dog Lender. I felt that this character embodied the spirit of the refugee camp and had the most consistent character development.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nI was going to say that the animation was average but then I realised that recent anime have really spoiled us with attractive graphics. Five years ago this would have been spectacular despite a slight dipping in quality here and there. So, it is quite good without breaking new ground. Especially the characters, they are very fluidly animated.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nThe music is a bit jarring at times. There are some ballads and slow tunes that really don't fit the post-apocalyptical scenery. A show like this needs DJ Space Beats and his fluorescent synthesiser. \\n\r\nOP: Beautiful. Lovely animation and lovely, ethereal song. \\n\r\nED: Slow ballad that failed to move me in any way.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\nEvery theme in this anime has been covered by a much better show. If it is yaoi you be wanting, you can find more titillating stuff. If it is post-apocalyptic science-fiction you be wanting there is Ergo Proxy. If it is natural mysticism you be wanting there is Miyazaki. Really, there is no reason for you to watch this.\\n",

            "content": "No.6 is a captivating anime and I can honestly say that after having just watched it twice through. But then again, everyone has different tastes and this just may not be your cup of tea. Even so, it couldn\u2019t hurt to try a sip, could it?\r\nNOTE: For my sake, I\u2019m writing Nezumi, as Nezumi, and not \u201cRat\u201d like in the subs, and Shion instead of Sion, like the MAL character page. \r\nStory \u2013 8/10. No.6 is a utopia, there is no poverty, there are no conflicts, there are no problems. You will live happily and peacefully within these safe walls, and you will wear thislovely bracelet that is your identity. Oh, and one last thing: if you doubt us, we won\u2019t hesitate to eliminate you. Ignorance really is bliss. \\n\\n\r\nOn his 12th birthday, Shion hides and helps an injured Nezumi, a VC. This leads to being stripped of his rights to live in Cronos and qualification to enter the Special Course. There\u2019s a time skip, and suddenly it\u2019s four years later and instead of studying ecology, Shion\u2019s a park worker. After witnessing two people strangely die, he\u2019s taken away by the Bureau of Safety. At that point, he\u2019s rescued by Nezumi and whisked away to the Western District to discover the truth about No.6. \\n\\n\r\nNo.6 is listed as Sci-fi and Action, but there are also elements of Fantasy and Shounen-ai. Yes, shounen-ai. I\u2019m not sure if I view it as a good thing, or bad. I mean, I\u2019m a fan of yaoi/shounen-ai, so that probably contributes largely to the fact I enjoyed it, but I know there are a ton of people who aren\u2019t comfortable with it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a fan of shounen-ai, you will enjoy this. Well, to be honest, I\u2019m not sure it would be able to appeal to any other audience beside BL fans...\\n\\n\r\nAside from the homosexual content, No.6 starts off with an intriguing plot \u2013 and I won\u2019t lie, I\u2019m a total sucker for utopia/dystopia stories. But like a lot of people, I thought this had a lot of potential to be something amazing, but it never did reach what it could have; whether it\u2019s because of the length of the anime, or because it got side-tracked by shounen-ai fan service, I\u2019m not sure. I kind of feel like a lot of loose ends weren\u2019t dealt with. \\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 7.25/10. The art... isn\u2019t one of No.6\u2019s stronger points. While it isn\u2019t terrible, it isn\u2019t amazing. The characters are sometimes really awkwardly drawn/animated, such as Shion\u2019s scar or his blushing. But the background and scenery are amazing, and the OP was done beautifully. Especially the last thirty seconds.  \\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 9/10. I won\u2019t lie; I strongly disliked the OP at first. I thought it was really strange sounding and the singer\u2019s voice was abnormally high... but as the episodes went on, I\u2019ve grown to like them quite a bit. I found myself watching and listening to it on replay. Anyways, it suited the feel of No.6 perfectly. And ohmygosh, the ED. EDs are something I skip over all the time. Not this one. I couldn\u2019t. This one I liked right away. It felt incredibly sad, almost like nostalgia. As cheesy as this sounds, my heart clenches when I hear it. Background music was very subtle, but added wonderfully to the overall feel. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors also did a pretty good job. Nezumi\u2019s singing was nice... though, it took a bit of time getting used to little Shion\u2019s and little Nezumi\u2019s deep voices... \\n\\n\r\nCharacter \u2013 8/10. I cried. I got so emotionally attached, that tears came pouring out when Nezumi began singing in the last episode, despite how confused I was. \\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning you\u2019re introduced to 12-year-old Nezumi. Running around from authorities in what seems to be a sewage system, panting, with blood trickling down his arm. He meets a dead end, where steel bars are closing off on an opening, preventing chances of escape. Then you\u2019re introduced to 12-year-old Shion. Right away their lives are contrasted. Shion\u2019s sitting at his desk in the middle of Safu\u2019s presentation; there hasn\u2019t been any real hardships he\u2019s been through in life since being ranked as having highest intelligence. \\n\\n\r\nShion is naive, innocent, kind, and for the most part, ignorant like many other No.6 citizens. Nezumi is sharp-tongued, gives of an arrogant vibe, and is artsy.  Yes, their personalities have been done before, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get bored of them... Shion and Nezumi are actually quite likable. As the anime progresses, you see moments of complete contradiction to their personalities which I found quite interesting. Shion has a darker, more aggressive side that comes out when it comes to Nezumi, and Nezumi definitely has a soft spot when it comes to Shion. This might make them seem out of character at times, but I think that\u2019s the point. They bring out entirely new sides of each other.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other supporting characters: Karan, Inukashi, Rikiga, even Yoming, \u2013 they\u2019re pretty okay. You know general information about their life and their past, but not in great detail. They\u2019re not exactly incredibly developed characters either, but the anime was only 11 episodes long.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only one I found kind of strange was Elyurias/Safu. I didn\u2019t really understand her presence or character...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 10/10. I enjoyed this 10/10 easily, even the second time going through. I grinned and I worried, I eagerly clicked each episode and got frustrated over waiting for the next one. With this anime, I watched it each episode from beginning to end, OP to ED. Stating it simply: I loved watching it [and rewatching it.] The last episode did confuse me a bit, but I\u2019m seriously longing for more. \\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 Each category is weighted differently for me, and of course, there are always miscellaneous factors. I consider Story to account for 25% of the overall ranking of animes, Art 10%, Sound 10%, Character 25%, and Enjoyment 30%.  \\n\\n\r\nSo, then:\\n\r\n[80% x 0.25] + [72.5% x 0.10] + [90% x 0.10] + [80% x 0.25] + [100% x 0.30] = 86.25%\\n\\n\r\nRound it up, and that\u2019s how No.6 gets a 9/10 from me... and my first review on MAL. ^_______^ \\n",

            "content": "Wow, that was painful. Please, anyone reading this, don't bother with this anime. Go pick up a translation of the novels or the manga. I've only read brief summaries of the novel, but those summaries were enough to let me know how good of a show this could have been, and just how far BONES had to go out of its way to make the No. 6 anime a complete trainwreck. \r\nThe first three episodes of the show were really interesting. Not fantastic, but enough to get me excited. There's a strong sense of mystery pervading the first episode: Why is this kid being pursued?What's that thing in the center of the city making a strange noise, one that causes those that hear it to listen in seeming awe and reverence? The second episode continues to add questions, while starting up the plot proper as prettyboy Nezumi helps hero Shion escape No. 6 before Shion can be taken to the Ministry of Love. Excuse me, I meant the Correctional Facility. The third episode gives us our look outside the city, so we can see a town built from freedom and poverty, distinct from the strict control of the supposed utopia beyond the walls. At the end of episode 3, Nezumi, who has stated his disgust at No. 6, promises to reveal to Shion why he hates Shion's former home, and why Shion should too.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then episode 4 comes, and we get nothing. Then episode 5 comes, and we get nothing. Episode 6? Nope. Episode 7? Still nothing. The show spins its wheels for four episodes, and Nezumi and Shion's interactions in each episode can be summed up like this:\\n\\n\r\nNezumi: I hate No. 6! I want to destroy it!\\n\r\nShion: Why?\\n\r\nNezumi: I'll tell you later!\\n\r\nShion: I love you, Nezumi.\\n\r\nNezumi: I hate you because you love No. 6!\\n\r\nShion: Why should I hate it?\\n\r\nNezumi: I'll tell you later!\\n\\n\r\nAnd so on. Eventually, something happens that causes them to actually decide to get off their asses and finally do something. This is episode 8. There are only 3 episodes left after this. They spend this episode seeing a guy who helped build the city, and getting answers from him. Why Nezumi didn't take Shion to him as soon as possible and keep the plot going is beyond me. We do learn some very important things this episode, though! Namely, the government of No. 6 is actually... evil! This was in no way obvious based on the previous seven episodes, and is a giant shock to everybody. We also learn about something called Elyurias, but what that actually is isn't explained yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe next bit will be a bit spoilerish. It shouldn't be too hard to guess the basics of what happens, but if you're really picky about avoiding spoilers you'll want to skip ahead, or stop reading and go do something that isn't watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe final three episodes end by showing a staggering display of incompetence by every single character and organization in the show (save for one, although that character is basically lucky). Nezumi and Shion infiltrate the Correctional Facility by the dumbest luck ever. Had things gone slightly not their way, they would have died instantly the second they entered the building. They wouldn't know where they should even be going in this place if it wasn't for a magic voice inside Shion's head. The guards of the supposedly secure facility are dispatched with ease by the two infiltrators. And then when Shion and Nezumi finally get to where they were going, the person they were trying to save has freed herself just fine thanks to the previously-mentioned magic voice. A resistance movement within No. 6 tries to do something, but they just kinda set off some bombs and talk to no one in particular. Random eco-magic destroys No. 6, everyone who survived is happy, or something. We don't learn much of anything, and just when we think we might we get a huge slap in the face for thinking that we should know what the hell we just watched.\\n\\n\r\nThose of you who pay close attention to the plot may notice that nothing Shion and Nezumi do actually affects it. They don't destroy No. 6, they don't save the West District, they don't save the person they were supposed to save, they don't save the innocents in No. 6 from the danger they're in. (The last one in particular was what Shion really focused on trying to do, before the show forgot that he was supposed to do that.) Everything that the heroes try to accomplish is done for them, and had Shion and Nezumi not been in the show, the plot would have been exactly the same. (I suppose there's one thing Nezumi does to help take down No. 6 at the very end, but nothing in the anime canon is preventing the one person who actually did anything useful from doing that as well. There's a reason for it in the manga, but the anime contradicts that reason.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was just as teasing as the plot. Sure, the relationship between Shion and Nezumi was cute, and the world needs more romances that don't make a big deal about the gender of the participants, but it didn't go much of anywhere. We'd watch Shion and Nezumi say the same things, and maybe kiss a couple times. It goes over better than the plot, since at least you know what's going on between the two, but still, it could have progressed a lot faster and gone a lot deeper. (I'd bet Nezumi would not have any problems going really deep into Shion's... feelings.)\\n\\n\r\nAt least the art looked nice, and the music wasn't so weird as to be completely distracting. I think that I'll probably remember the music most fondly, not because it was particularly amazing, but just because it was really strange. Also, Safu is the best character and I wish she'd be in the show more. (Apparently she has an expanded role in the anime compared to the novels, and considering how little she's involved in the anime...) Unfortunately, that isn't nearly enough to make this worth anyone's time, not when you could be reading the novels. Or Brave New World. Or 1984. Or watching Steins;Gate. Or Lucky Star. Or Blue's Clues. (At least you got to know the answers to the mystery at the end of each episode.)\\n\\n\r\n(Update: Someone informed me that No. 6 is considered to be a novel, not a light novel. I've changed that up above. I've seen conflicting information about this, though, but this change hopefully will still make sense. If it doesn't, just pretend I said 'book' each time I said 'novel'. If that still doesn't work for you, replace it with whatever you want.)",

            "content": "Had so much potential but was wasted. When I saw the first episode I fell in love with the characters and became very interested in the story. I was so glad this wasn't one of those animes where you had to watch up until episode 4 or 5 before something good happens. It started right out with some action and character development.\r\nWatching the next batch of episodes had me hooked because there was so many things going on with Shion and Nezumi, both apart and together, plus the background of No. 6 and how it got the way it is. The horrible acts committed bythem et al. I thought I was in for a good treat. And on top of it all, the two male characters were falling in love, not just some boy love teasers some animes throw out to bait Yaoi fans into watching. I've always wanted to watch an action anime where the male leads fall for each other but it isn't a drama or romance show. Mirage of Blaze is the only other anime I can think of that was action and yaoi. So I was on cloud nine.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, somewhere along the way the show lost focus and had no idea what it was going to do with the characters or the No.6 city itself. It begins to trip and falter and just does not know how to pick itself up. The characters essentially become cardboard cut outs and just placed in scenes and seem to not really do anything. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, Shion and Nezumi seem to have conflict about their viewpoints on how No. 6 should be handled with people dying. Nezumi wishes to destroy the city while Shion wants to save the people. Yet neither character does anything about it. Then the writers tried to focus on the female character (I forgot her name) the girl who was in love with Shion. But they have no idea what to even do with her by this point, it's just her walking around thinking about Shion, then when she decides to do something she gets taken.\\n\\n\r\nSo I'm thinking, fine, I guess this will cause Shion to act and maybe cause some tension between he and Nezumi. And they do act by going to save her. Meanwhile, the story takes a whole new focus on these forest people and alluding to the girl and Nezumi having a connection. But this goes NO WHERE! \\n\\n\r\nThe connection between Shion's mother being one of the creators of No.6 goes NO WHERE\\n\r\nThe Radical group who wants to take down No. 6 from the inside, goes NO WHERE\\n\r\nFinding out why or how No.6 turned out the way it did, goes NO WHERE\\n\\n\r\nI tried to figure out what was happening here with this show that started out so good and the only thing I got is that the show lacked a human villain. When you have a city or institution as the villain, having a personification of the city would help. After all who is behind the city? Who is the one giving the orders for these terrible acts to take place? Sure Nezumi and Shion are fighting against the city, but who is the one they have to beat? Who does the radical group have to go after to free themselves of No.6?\\n\\n\r\nNo one??\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, the writers try to solve this glaring issue by making the girl who loves Shion into a magical forest goddess that they have to beat. *eye roll* \\n\r\nThen at the ending when everything seems so bleak the girl transforms into a large magical bee and destroys the city walls with bee tornado for Shion because having him do it himself would take more episodes than they were willing to write. She also grants instant life with her LGBT rainbow powers then float away with her magical bees.\\n\\n\r\nYes an action Scifi post apocalyptic anime transforms into a fantasy magical anime at the end.  \\n\r\n*headache*\\n\\n\r\nBy this time I am just watching for Shion and Nezumi's love story. But I'm given NOTHING but a second kiss on the lips and the characters deciding to part ways for unexplained reasons.  Honestly, I would had been better off just watching the first episode and just using my own imagination to come up with what happens. \\n",

            "content": "Seemed to be lacking in reviews, so decided for me to write my own.\r\nFirstly, although only four episodes in, there are some definite Shonen Ai hints. We still have some more episodes to go before it is confirmed, but it is most definitely on the cards. So do not watch if you aren't into that kind of thing. If not, do try this, it makes for interesting character (and comical) interaction and relationship. (Sometimes even married couple like)\r\nNow onto the main story, set in the near future in a Dystopia. (Google is your friend) Which follows Sion and Nezumi(Rat)'s story that investigates the mysteries ofan area inside the Dystopia called NO.6. I will not go into the story too much, as I will just be repeating the synopsis already on here and on the other reviews. Though I will say that it is worth it to bare with the slow-ish episodes- It will undoubtedly pick up. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty, like all bones series, the opening is pretty to look at. At first I hated the song choice, but it has started to grow on me, although I wouldn't listen to it actively on on Ipod. The ending I find much better and was perfect for the mood in the last scene of episode 4 and I have a feeling it will be used at some point again in the same way. Background music is good and used appropriately. Nothing special, but adds to the scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe contrast between the two characters is clear from the start and the opening does a great job at portraying this. Well done Bones! The relationship between the two characters and the plot both seem to be of equal importance. What I like best is the realisticness of the two main characters, especially Nezumi's. This is rare and I find it quite refreshing. Although Sion's character can come across as irritating at points. A third notable character is Safu, Sion's female best friend, who you could say is his heterosexual love interest who is in love with him. Who I don't personally take to nor does she contribute much to the series thus so far. Interested to see if this changes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is pretty high surprisingly. It is unlike most series you will come across and although I don't see it becoming the next smash-hit anime. It is a unique anime which is different from all the mainstream animes you have seen cloned many time. And the Shonen Ai subcontext adds to the story in a way that most Anime shy away from. Good for you, no.9! I will be watching to see how the series progresses. And so should you. Now, go watch! :)!",

            "content": "Firstly, No. 6 is very homotastic.  It`s a fact.  But to anyone who may be discouraged by the not-very-subtle homosexuality, I advise that you keep watching.  Whether or not you like the overt man-love that erupts between Nezumi and Sion (who, oddly, resemble a certain pair of characters from D.Gray Man who get a lot of Yaoi attention as well), getting past it will reveal an intriguing, thought-provoking plot.  Given, it is just like any utopian anime in concept - Nuclear War, bla bla bla, Utopia that turns out to not be Utopia.  Yet, No. 6 does not suffer fromthat.  In fact, thus far, it has provoked as much thought as 1984 and Farenheit 451, the masterpieces of Utopian/dystopian novels.  Moreover, No. 6 performs its characterization exceptionally.  The relationship between Sion and Nezumi aside, the stories of each of its characters (Karan, Sion`s mother; the as of yet enigmatic Yomin/Yoming; Safu, the poor girl who has yet to realize that her love, Sion, now looks like Allen Walker and has already been claimed by a bishounen crossdressing actor) are weaved with the skill of a starving Gandhi on the spinning wheel in a British Prison.  The music and art are nothing spectacular (but in no way deficient), but No. 6 is one anime that succeeds in running on plot alone.  Though there is a strong element of shounen ai, No.6 doesn`t attempt to sell itself on the homosexuality, and in fact goes about it in a serious and mature fashion (I don`t mean mature as in the Movie Rating - quite the opposite, in fact).  There are no not-so-subtle harems, very few coincidences that end up with Sion sprawled over Nezumi  (or vice versa) in suggestive positions and no clothes on and no conveniently intriguing animation - in fact, there is very little sexuality in the relationship between Sion and Nezumi (until the last episode, at which it becomes blatantly obvious).  No. 6 sells itself on plot, and I would say it is definitely worth buying.  So leave aside what biases you may have knowing it might be a little fabulous, and just go with it, and you might find yourself pleasantly surprised.\\n\\n\r\n=Edit/Update=\\n\\n\r\nHaving watched the last episode, I am a little bit disappointed in No.6, perhaps simply on account of the ending.  Though the last episode hastily ties up most of the plot points to a watchable conclusion, it fails to truly explain some of the story background, such as the exact nature of No.6, the role of Sion`s mother Karan, the exact purposes and extent of the resistance led by Yoming (and whether, given this is a fansub, is actually his name) and who in god`s name the Forest Blokes are.  At the end of the road, it seems as if the destination was not worth the journey.  As an anime with only 11 episodes, there is some reason to forgive No. 6 for its rushed ending and the inability to tie out many plot points, but it`s still a little disappointing to see a story that had great, great potential end up merely good.  I wouldn`t say it renders No. 6 unwatchable, but it prevents it from reaching its full potential.",

            "content": "The story of no. 6 is set in a post apocalyptic earth, where humans are divided into 6 cities, and the one that is focused on is number 6, hence the title. So far, so good right? We have a story that occurs outside of a high school for once. Throw a few dystopian elements in, and it immediately looks like something worth watching. Not to mention, no. 6 is animated by studio Bones, the people behind FMA: Brotherhood. So why do I not enjoy this nearly as much as similar animes?\r\nLet\"s take a closer look.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nJust a fair warning, this is not an animefor people who cannot stand shounen ai. Not that it's a vital piece to the story or anything, but there are still some moments that might turn you off if you don't enjoy that kind of romance.\\n\\n\r\nSo here's the story. Sion, our protagonist, was a young, promising student. On the night of his 12th birthday, he met a fleeing fugitive, Nezumi. Despite knowing that he would be punished by the law, hid and helped him escape. Four years later, after witnessing a strange event at work, he was taken away by the police and was rescued by Nezumi and the two of them ran to the outside world that the walls of no. 6 was trying to hide from its inhabitants.\\n\r\nAfter putting so much of drama in the opening episodes of the show, you would think that the creators would then try to maintain the audience's attention right? Wrong. The remainder of No.6 is then used to explain side characters that you would never care about, raises conflicts that would just disappear not to ever return. Maybe it's because of how short this series is, but that does not cover up for the fact that there are many episodes that just waste time building up to a good development, and then completely forgets about it next week. I've find myself wanting to drop no. 6 because of that.  It is not until near the end of the show when things are finally explained and the plot moves on. However, by the time that happens, we're already on the last few episodes and there's no room left to truly establish a good motive or villain.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the character design is not very outstanding, Studio Bones does do a very good job of animating No. 6. The few actions scenes are worth watching and they do make the show a lot more enjoyable. Of course, this is not FMA, but it is fun looking at Nezumi beating the crap out of some random grunt.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic is perhaps No. 6 worst aspect. The op and ed are fine, and I rather enjoyed them, but the BGM is bad to say the least and some tracks just simply fails to deliver a good moment. That is not very annoying in through out most of the anime since nothing really happens, but when things really heat up later on, don't expect shivers to run down your spine because of the epic music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentions before, the side characters of this show are not very interesting. Although No.6 does try to give the audience something to relate to them, there's not very much to grasp onto as they are only given a few minutes of back story at best before being thrown into the plot device closet again. Where the show really shines is the interaction between Nezumi and Sion and that's what made me stick around. I'm not going to reveal a lot of it here since I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but I'm going to say that through their interactions, they grow a lot together and character development is always very appreciated in my book.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show was recommended to me by a friend who was praising it a lot, and I could see why. Does that mean I enjoy it as much as she did? Unfortunately no. Despite having potential, No. 6 just falls short of many other brethren of the same genre, and the music did not help a lot either.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't watch a lot of anime in the scifi or dystopia genre, you might find No.6 a refreshing deviation from your typical high school anime. It has a decent plot, and overall solid leads. However, if you're the type that could talk about Ergo Proxy, Psycho Pass, etc. for days on end, this title might be a bit lack luster for you. Despite that however, No. 6 does manage to pull itself through in the end. Is it an anime that you must watch before you kick the bucket? No. But is it a good way to spend a boring Saturday afternoon? Yes.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let's just start this off by saying: wow. Honestly.. just wow. I've seen 10 episodes, so I know what I'm talking about. \r\nStory:\r\nThe story itself is okay. The thought behind it is intriguing, but the way they've told it, the way they've progressed.. it's just absolutely horrible. \"best security ever\" is all they discuss for 3 episodes long, and when they finally infiltrate, they are all able to walk by freely. A hallway with 30 people in, someone asks you something, you punch them in the stomach, and then are able to get away without someone noticing? Yeah. Okay. \r\nArt and sound: \r\nThe art isokay. A bit dodgy at some points, but overall okay. The sound is great as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWow. Okay, here we go. The characters are inconsistent. Inconsistent to the point where you just want to tear your eyeballs out of frustration. \\n\\n\r\nMain:\\n\\n\r\nShion:\\n\r\nHe started off as a naive little kid, always seeing the positive side to things. It got a bit creepy when another kid, about his age, grabbed him from behind and pulled a knife to his throat. All he could do was laugh, smile, and not be terrified. \\n\r\nLater on, after the wasp bite, he manages to keep his positive side, even though he's really an unguided missile. \\n\\n\r\nNezumi:\\n\r\nThis guy.. wow. If there'd truly be a Kira, he'd be at the top of the list. Never seen someone deceive so many people, enjoy it, and later on cry about it when alone in bed. Imagine asking someone for help by entering their bedroom doors from the outside, only to put up a knife to the kids throat. \\n\r\nImagine saying \"fuck you\", \"i wont help you even as you die\", \"your mom was a stinky old dog\", and then later on to say \"ill help you always\". No sorry's, just this. \\n\r\nHe hates Shion, but yet, has developed romantic feelings for him. If I knew this were to be a ecchi series, I'd never have started. This guy goes from killing someone in cold blood, to making sure his clothes don't get dirty, to avoid killing someone at all costs. He makes no sense. None of the characters do though.\\n\\n\r\nInukashi: \\n\r\nThis woman hates everything in the entire world, and yet, loves everything that she owns. \"Go fuck yourself and die\" seems to be the attitude she has. Going after Nezumi when he's walking alone, accompanied by her dogs, she wants to tear him apart. Even though they're actually good friends. See how it doesn't make sense? \\n\\n\r\nSide:\\n\r\nRikiga. This guy must have been a pervert, and therefore placed outside of No. 6. There is no other explanation. \\n\r\nYouming. This guy seems like he wants to help, yet, only later shows his real intentions. Raping, killing and misleading the one he wanted to help. \\n\r\nSafu. Good girl. Bit weird to ask for a guy's semen only if the girl's.. what? 14-15? \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nDon't bother watching. It goes to such extremes. From not hurting a fly to shooting someone in the head whilst they are lying on the floor begging for their lives. Note that I'm talking about the same character in both scenarios. I've yet to see more shittier characters than this anime does. If you feel I'm wrong in any way, feel free to contact me. I'd love to spread more hate about this anime. \\n\\n\r\nGood god, please go watch something worthwhile. I will be finishing this, only because I don't like loose ends.",

If you are the  type of person that , like many i know, watch anime in the background  while doing other things and just look close when things blow up... dont bother with this one. You will miss details and not get the big picture and small subplots and it will seem boring.\r\nYes not much action in the middle episodes, and yes some characters on a first look might just seem filling. But if you look closer it's not so.\r\nThis isn't an action anime. It actually addresses manyissues about what is is to be human, how we can evolve or not, how we make our own place in the world and most importantly how we deal and interact with others that come into our lives even for just a few minutes...\\n\\n\r\nI also see nothing wrong with the ending, I thought it was magnificent.\\n\r\nAnd i strongly disagree with the comment that Nezumi and Shion had no effect on the outcome. Quite the contrary, in my interpretation what they did and said in the machine room changed what was going to happen and all episodes (how meaningless they seem to some ) build the interactions and feelings of all the characters in that scene, in that moment.",

            "content": "No. 6 is probably one of the most publicised anime of the Summer 2011 season, for this reason only:\r\nThe two characters are supposedly gaybones for each other.\r\nNo. 6 is a beautifully animated series by Studio Bones, who also gave us Full Metal Alchemist and Soul Eater. It is based on a series of light novels and should be known for its literary allusions and dystopian undertones. However, though the potential for an intelligent sci-fi anime is there, it is never fully realised.\r\nEven in the light novels the plot seems rather dodgy, indecisive on whether it wants to focus on mythology or science as a basisfor the series. As such it is an awkward blend of both, which is similar in its effectiveness as trying to force two like-poles of a magnet together. \\n\\n\r\nThis is the telling fault line in the foundation of the entire premise, and it is not alone. The stereotypical image of a sci-fi fan, wearing their Star Trek uniform and watching Babylon 5, does not meld well with the idea of romance, let alone boys' love, in general; especially as what romantic interaction there is between the two mains feels wedged in as an afterthought. While the original novels integrated the romance in alongside the development of the plot - making this a case of adaption decay - it is still ultimately these conflicting ideas that weaken the show at its heart. If the series leaned more towards a more mythical slant I believe that what shounen-ai there is would have been melded into the plot a lot more naturally, as historically mythology has never been shy of contraversial pairings between its characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is rather badly adapted overall: this is one if those shows you have to read up on to understand exactly what has happened. Possibly this is a case of the show being compressed so much, but after reading the summary of the last volume (which I can't recommend enough - http://hiriajuu.livejournal.com/7568.html) it seems that Studio Bones apparently, like many of the characters, had a stroke, and decided to make shit up. Overall the gaps are too great for the average viewer to try and guess what's going on, and the composition of the series feels very inconsistent episode to episode. It just left me with a slightly annoyed feeling afterwards. However, if you're a softcore sci-fi fan or hardcore BL nerd with the imagination to fill in the gaps, perhaps this won't be much of an issue for you.\\n\\n\r\nWhereas the characters themselves are compelling, in theory, (the dreamy boy genius, exiled tsundere with a ponytail, as well as a journalist-turned-pimp and a dogkeeper whose gender you will spend more time pondering than the actual intricacies of the plot), but in practice the characterisation is inconsistent and at sometimes enough to make you wonder if the characters have had strokes. One minute Nezumi and Sion are getting along fine, the next they're arguing, the next they're...dancing?\\n\\n\r\nThough there is the fan emphasis on the shounen-ai elements, if you go into this show on that merit alone, you will be sorely disappointed. Though there are one or two signs of affection between the two male leads, Nezumi and Sion, as a romance it is sorely unfulfilling and as mentioned before, the motivations of the two are unclear at best and agonizingly OOC at worst. The ending, without giving any spoilers, doesn't improve on anything.  \\n\\n\r\nBut not all is terrible about this show. The voice acting is quite good; notably, Sion's seiyuu does a fantastic job at tormented screams of pain. The other character's voices fit them well and I have no qualms here. \\n\\n\r\nThe saving grace of this series is the animation: it is stunningly pretty. The character designs are unique enough, but it is the backgrounds that are truly beautiful. Especially detailed are the iconic buildings, representing the cold, steeled nature of the city itself. \\n\\n\r\nThe music used was atmospheric and appropriate for the scene, as were the opening and ending songs, though the ending animation felt rather out-of-place and as the series went on, I began to openly resent its abrupt intrusion into the story. I really enjoyed the croaky vocals of the OP and would probably download it to listen to; the rest, not so much. \\n\\n\r\nMany people will watch this series and, much as I did earlier, pontificate on if, why and how shounen-ai /BL/homosexuality belongs in a sci-fi setting. So it is ironic that No. 6's biggest weakness is the same as science fiction's greatest shortcoming. \\n\\n\r\nNo. 6's biggest defect is not the huge gaps in storytelling nor the compression of source material to fit it into five and a half hours of anime - though these are glaring - but the fact that, ultimately, No. 6 feels cold. As cold the metallic buildings and swathes of blue we see in the very first moments of the opening; as cold as the hearts of the people that run the city. Though the characters were smart, cute, at times funny, I felt no emotional connection to them after the show ended. The question is not, 'can sci-fi be gay too?' but 'can sci-fi cultivate a romance, of any orientation? Can sci-fi make me emphathise with the characters even if there is a complicated plot and futuresque setting?' \\n\\n\r\nFor No. 6, the answer is no.",

The beginning, and the end. Last time when I reviewed this anime were when I was done watching episode 7, and by then I realized that this anime was lacking of action and interest. between episode 4 an 8 it was very minimal action happening in this anime. The only thing I was excited about by then was when Safu was captured, and after when they started to rescuing her, I was more revealedthat the excitement finally was back and it actually happened something\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning really took up inportant parts like how Sion and Nezumi met, and how they met again years afterwards. Although for me it was kinda confusing to hang on in the first two episodes. Especially if you did it just like I did: Watched the teaserphoto (thet one with Sion and Nezumi), then I was like \"Where is the whitehaired guy?\" but later on I got things clear to me and could follow the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending really made me a bit sad because of the terrible happenings, but later on near the ending it seemed like it really went fine. But still I really wonder why Nezumi suddenly left Sion. Couldn't they be together even though they succeeded with their mission? And then I really wanted to see many after-scenes like when Sion and his mom finally meets which we never see them do.\\n\\n\r\nSummaringly. The beginning and the ending is really great (except about the named parts), but the middle... It was really unnecessary I gotta say. Nezumi and Sion is repeating the same questions to each other, and they never get an answer, which can be pretty irritating. But otherwise, I don't regret watching this anime.",

            "content": "I'd love to give that show a good 9+. I really would. Sadly, No.6 is a prefect example of anime screwed up by a bad ending. Last 5 minutes of the show make the overall score drop by one. Still, it's a great, compelling story for those, who love drama with a piece of action. \r\nStory: \r\nAnime follows the story of  Sion, who lives in a perfect, utopian society of city called No.6, and Nezumi, who falls the victim of authorities ruling mentioned town. Two boys join forces to discover the truth about about the city, as well as themselves. \r\nAs you can see,what we deal with is a dystopian society - perfect at first glimpse, but rotten at the core. On the other side we have people living ouside the city - animals spending their lives in the slums. At that point No. 6 breaks typical sci-fi convention - in films like Equilibrium or Book of Eli, those who oppose the system are good, almost bleached out guys. In No.6, it's the choice between being happy, but manipulated, or constantly in danger, but free. \\n\r\nSion and Nezumi spend their days in the latter part of the world. Surrounded by violence, rape and filth the're getting more and more drawn to each other. \\n\\n\r\nThis way we got to the strongest part of the show - character developemet. Both boys are sensitive and inteligent, as a contrast to a harsh world surrounding them. Still, it's not flat. Nezumi, natural-born badass, likes poetry (if you like finding tropes in anime, you'll be in heaven). Sion, a full-heart pacifist and humanist can punch a guy in the face. Besides, Nezumi confronting Sion is a big clash of ideologies. It's really great to watch as they try to explain each other their point of view, and how the other one reacts. Both of them, treir relationship, how certain things slowly change their personality, is a piece of well done, deep character developement. \\n\r\nNot to mention solid, interesting bacground characters. \\n\\n\r\nArt, Sound and Setting\\n\\n\r\nThere is not much of \"music\" in No. 6. Soundtracks played in background are not someting that touch your heart and makes you think \"I love that track! Need to hear it more!\" but they create the atmosphere nicely. However, I have to mention beautiful elegies sung by several characters. Quality of art in the show is good, there are scenes with bad animation, but sudden drop of quality between highly appealing scenes is something common in recent anime's. The overal look of characters is nice to watch, and bg are rich. \\n\r\nAs or the setting, some scenes, like dialouges, ale played flawless, which is great for a series full of it, but other scenes seem to be a little bit too rushed (especially most lyrical ones). I think that is beacuse the series is too short, and director still tried to make it a little bit more metaphisical. \\n\\n\r\nNo. 6 was great, touching story to watch. It gets strange at the end, but still I highly reccomend to watch it.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The past few seasons of Noitamina titles seem to have a trend going on: have one title down-to-earth with its storyline offering good quality plotting and characterization within its 11 episode length (Hourou Musuko and Ano Hana) while the other title features a grand-scale plot which while slick in presentation, has too much within its series to properly convey a well laid-out plot that explores its world due to limited episode count (Fractale and C). The Summer 2011 season continues the trend with the grand-scale plot series coming in the form of No. 6. The series appears to be portraying a dystopian society where thedesirable people within its populace are nurtured and intentionally left in the dark about the true reality of the world around them. Shion finds himself becoming aware of this reality as he interacts with the mysterious rogue known as Nezumi which costs the former his desirable status in the said mentioned society.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing to this series is already looking fairly rushed as time already skips ahead several years following the first episode and the pace in which Shion flees from the city he lived in gives you little breathing room to get any sense of the world within and outside the city Shion had lived in. Thus far, I get the feel this is turning out to be a cookie-cutter dystopian title in the same vain as Fractale yet with a darker and rougher edge to it. Like Fractale and C, the visuals thus far are of great quality with clean details and subdued color shades to convey the dark mood the series gives off. While action hasn't been so prominent thus far, the show does have its moments of fluid animation seen from Nezumi dealing with the Men in Black as he gets Shion out of the city.\\n\\n\r\nWith how No. 6 has turned out thus far, I'm not too confident in saying I'll get any anticipation out of seeing what happens next with Shion and Nezumi in this anime if this series is geared only for an 11-episode run limiting the amount of time the series can put into exploring its elements. I'm dropping this series at this point and hope that Noitamina can cut it with this routine of offering one down-to-earth series that works well within its episode count and another that has too much to squeeze into 11 episodes.",

It's so well written and so inspiring that when I started to watch the anime I had such high hopes especially after reading a few of the light novel volumes as well as the manga, however I was a bit disappointed in the outcome. I wouldn't say that the anime was all that bad, it was enjoyable, the Japanese voice actors were absolutely amazing (dubbed version is horrible don't watch that) and that's what really kept me going until the very end and of course the story of Shion and Nezumi. It's very facepaced and it leaves a lot of be desired in the end. Personally I think it could have been better if they gave it 12 or 13 episodes just to tie some loose ends for people who haven't read the novels or manga, unfortunately we were given an eleven episode rush job. It's not the type of story that needs twenty four episodes but and extra one or two would have made a difference. Aside from that the art work, music, and characters were very well done. I suggest to anyone who wants to watch this or who has watched it already to please please please read the manga or download the light novel's online. You won't be disappointed and you can get a lot more out of that than the anime itself!",

Despite all the negative reviews, I felt the story flowed so nicely that as soon as the ending song started I frequently caught myself in surprise thinking \"what? already?\". \r\nMain themes are contrasts, knowledge/ignorance, dreams/reality. Inside the narrative, though, there is a lot of refreshingly progressive turns. There are strong, feisty intelligent girls interested in sex, there are strong emotional relationships regardless of gender and time, there are people in sync with animals,and there is clear character development. I was hooked, and I can't wait to read the manga.\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed Psychopass and Guilty Crown before landing on No.6, and I do think it is a good series for any fan of dystopian sci-fi.",

I've been off this site for a while, but once I watched the first episode of this, II wanted to make sure everyone knew how great it was. I wanted to give it a ten on the spot overall, but rating an entire series on the first episode is stupid. \r\nNo. 6 has everything I've been currently looking for in an anime. It has Josei, or it seems, kinda like Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, but on a Skyblue scale. \r\nIt has adventure, but not in the \"Quest Factor\" but more like the \"Slice of Life\" introductoryjourney into full scale investigation, like Monster.\\n\r\nI'm hoping it's Seinen, it may make or break the show, but Deadman Wonderland has done fabulously, and I would like to see this flourish as well.\\n\r\nRomance is a good one. Or at least romantic tension. It gives me various mixed feelings while watching.\\n\r\nMystery/Tragedy/Conspiracy are my hooks. They do so much for the plot that all I want to do is skip work and stare at the glowing screen until a new episode airs.\\n\\n\r\nI want to take a second to compliment the art and music combo. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is so spectular, especially when you watch in HD like I do. The colors are beautifully vivid, especially the night scene with the typhoon. That was gorgeous. And the music compliments so well. It sets a mellow tone through the whole first episode, so you know that you're gonna have to fasten the straps on your emotional rollercoater car. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I'm going to be watching this until the end, no messing around with other things. This is a priority and I'm gonna make damn sure to get that freaking watch of Shion's!!!!",

Off the bat, the two main characters show that a complex, turbulent but genuine relationship will form. Other characters introduced in the show are also fascinating with strange dynamics between them. I would have liked to know more about the world of the show.Like most future dystopian stories, there are things you want to know that both drive you crazy but also make the world even more fascinating.

For a start, I think the two mains are incredibly likable, and very contrasting. Nezumi, who even though is very serious at times has plenty of other moments that make his character charming and funny. Especially his interactions with the rather naive Sion.\r\nThe only character I really didn't like was the girl counterpart, Safu, although, one of her lines earlier into the anime had me laughing my head off.\r\nThe plot is also really fantastic, therewere many times when I was watching this that I became very emotionally; to the point of kicking and shrieking to then cheering and jumping about my room excitedly. Well done story!\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyus were also amazing, I found myself falling in love with their voices, especially Nezumi's, which was deliciously sexy. Not to mention his Seiyu also has an drool worthy singing voice too.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song, well when I first heard it, I was turning my nose up at it a little, but after a couple of times of hearing it, it really grew on me!\\n\\n\r\nThe art was also lovely, everything extremely well drawn. Yes, the two mains look a lot like Kanda Yuu and Allen Walker from D.Gray-man. Even if they do, I would never see the two mains as ripoffs. Though I would understand if people thought Allen and Sion shared a lot more than just looks, they have very similar motives. However still, I think Sion has got enough going to stand out as an individual character and not an Allen Walker lookalike.\\n\\n\r\nThe shounen-ai type theme also that ran along side the story, I thought was an added bonus, but that's just my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this anime, it's been ages since I've actually watched anime in fact.So i'm glad this is the one that's started me going again. As of right now, i'm recommending it to my friends, via fangirl attack.\\n",

I mean for some scenes it's exceptional, but other than that it's kind of amateurish. but don't let that distract you from the story line, anybody could mess up on animation. \\n\\n\r\nthe soundtrack was pretty good. it went pretty well with the anime and was just ok in general. and honestly, the opening is my favourite song for the whole anime. even though it starts off absolutely amazing, but then goes into this kind of high pitched squealing we have to pretend is singing. i'm not saying the music is bad, it's just, not so much the kind of music you would see with such a good plot.\\n\\n\r\nas for the characters...Nezumi x Shion.....I ship them, and I bet mst of you who've seen the anime will too. pfft, Safu and Shion, please. but that's not the point. the point is, the background stories fit the characters amazingly. and it seems they could be based on people in real life. \\n\\n\r\noverall, this anime is one you would not regret watching. even if the genres don't make it seem like something you would watch, you should definitely watch anyway. you won't be disappointed.",

            "content": "No.6 makes a valiant effort to cram as many themes as it possibly can in its short duration. It aspires to be a post apocalyptic dystopian adventure, a corrupted-regime-fighting character study with a dash of yaoi and some inexplicably mystical deus ex machina as topping. It all makes as much sense as divining the future from my cat\u2019s furballs. \r\nStory:\r\nStupidly naive boy is kicked out of an artificial paradise city, lives with a pretty bad-boy in a refugee ghetto. Confusing situations ensue.\r\nThe story is all over the place. It spends too much time on things that are proven to be unimportant in the end, ituses cheap tricks and gimmicks and leaves behind a plot so ridden with holes it feels like eating Swiss cheese. I kind of wonder, what sort of audience is this aimed at? It has far too little yaoi to appeal to the boys\u2019 love club. It is not nearly science fiction-y enough to appeal to the scifi buffs. It has too little action to classify as a typical shonen. \\n\r\nFrankly, I was bored most of the time. I did exercise my mind by pointing out the logical inconsistencies so that must count for something, like fighting against Alzheimer's in my old age. Also, it does not help that we have a faceless sort of threatening enemy doing largely illogical things like trashing the refugees' slum city, taking prisoners, driving them to prison and then executing them. I mean, why not just kill them then and there? My brain, it hurts.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nMost anime who fail the story test can still reclaim some viewing enjoyment from well fleshed out characters. Not so here.\\n\r\nShion is supposed to be the main character but he is so frigging useless I kind of wonder why are all the other characters so enamoured of him. I get it, he is supposed to be the embodiment of kindness and altruism in a jaded society so that he draws others in like a white light. In theory. In practice he is so annoyingly stupid I really wanted to put his head to the meat grinder and feed him to my cat.\\n\r\nNezumi is the bad boy who rescues him\u2014and the love interest, you should know. For 2/3 of the anime he is the standard \u201cabusive attractive asshole\u201d. Hey, at least he does interesting stuff and he's not stupid\u2014much. \\n\r\nSafu is Shion\u2019s childhood friend and has a crush on him. Hmm, looks like someone didn't get the memo. Safu the beard spends a lot of time mooning over her love that never was and in the end proves to be a plot device. \\n\r\nOf all the other secondary characters\u2014who are all as useful to the plot as a third leg\u2014I mostly liked the Dog Lender. I felt that this character embodied the spirit of the refugee camp and had the most consistent character development.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nI was going to say that the animation was average but then I realised that recent anime have really spoiled us with attractive graphics. Five years ago this would have been spectacular despite a slight dipping in quality here and there. So, it is quite good without breaking new ground. Especially the characters, they are very fluidly animated.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nThe music is a bit jarring at times. There are some ballads and slow tunes that really don't fit the post-apocalyptical scenery. A show like this needs DJ Space Beats and his fluorescent synthesiser. \\n\r\nOP: Beautiful. Lovely animation and lovely, ethereal song. \\n\r\nED: Slow ballad that failed to move me in any way.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\nEvery theme in this anime has been covered by a much better show. If it is yaoi you be wanting, you can find more titillating stuff. If it is post-apocalyptic science-fiction you be wanting there is Ergo Proxy. If it is natural mysticism you be wanting there is Miyazaki. Really, there is no reason for you to watch this.\\n",

However, compared whith others, No.6 is more focused on the story and the main characters.\r\nNezumi and Shion are the protagonist of No.6. Nezumi is the typical character that was hurt badly and now he can\u2019t trust anyone. In fact, he thinks that trusting someone will make him weak. There comes Shion, the innocent guy that knows nothing about what\u2019s up outside his little world. However, he seems willing to learn about the harsh reality and confront it.Apart from the protagonists, there are other interesting characters like Safu, Dogkeeper or Shions mother. Almost all of them experience a changes in their attitude, the character development is considerable in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s obvious that the main characters love each other. They show this with little actions and words rather than with physical contact.

But as the show continued it just seemed to fall flat. The characters didn't develop well. The story was rushed, especially towards the end. I felt like the Nezumi/Shion pairing they put in the show was poorly done and felt practically forced just to please fangirls. Safu, while being an important character, was hardly in the show at all and all you really learn about her is that she has a thing for Shion. I wasreally disappointed by this anime. It could've been a lot better than it turned out to be with some character growth added and a story that didn't feel so rushed coming together. I felt that they had so much to work with but just didn't. Questions were left unanswered, the characters were a bit lackluster and the ending was rather predictable. Overall, the show ended up being utterly average.",

            "content": "Well, I have actually been tryin to watch this back in the summer of last year. And I finished it in one day, so that's nice. Now, onto the review.\r\nI do have to say, the main reason I wanted to watch this show was because it was recommended as a yaoi anime. But in all entirety, it's not really all that yaoish. Yeah, the main characters are the intended couple, but this is more of a story than a yaoi anime. So, even though I was disappointed in that area, it turned out to be a great story all together with amazing characters. I reallycould not stop watching once I had actually started.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10 - The story, though somewhat...unoriginal with the post apocalyptic background, turns out to be something different than most in that genre. When I had first started watching, I was a little confused in the beginning, but as the story carried on, it began to make more sense. The mystery of the background of the city and the people unravel with each episode. I really was blown away but the events that occurred and many of the twists and turns the plot seemed to take. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 10 - Though, looking rather common in modern art styles, for some reason, the eyes seem to catch...well, your eye. I have to say that that was what really pulled me into the art. The amount of detailed put into one small part really sold me. And when you take all the other bits, it looks just as stunning. Everything shows effort and focus, even though it was a short series, the artists made EVERY episode count with it's beautiful art and style. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 10 - The music was always soothing or seemed to fit in with the idea of the show, I always found myself listening to both the opening and ending themes, though I often usually skip those when watching anime. The voices were also well done, I can say for both the English and the Japanese. I had watched halfway through the anime in Japanese, stopped for some unknown reason and when I decided to pick the anime up again, I decided to watch it in English this time around. The actors, in both, put a lot of effort into their acting. Though, there were times when I felt that the English lacked a certain emotion, I have to admit that I felt the same way with the Japanese at times. But overall, it turned out rather nicely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10 - Now, since most people think this is yaoi, there is bound to be a Seme and Uke character. Turns out that there is neither. Sure, at first it seems that way, but the two main characters, Nezumi (Rat) and Shion, both showcase their own traits that of neither of these categories. The character development, or rather, reveal-ment for Rat, is stunning and really makes you want to know more, of not only the characters but of the backstory of these characters. Many times during the anime, I often questioned some actions the characters did and later on, after these actions were explained, it either left me satisfied or mind-blown by the reasons. Every little turn in this left me wanting to know more.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10 - I have to say, that I thoroughly enjoyed it. Even though I had watched it for the soul purpose of yaoi, it lacked it with many other animes. But it made up for that disappointment with story and characters. Everything was so drawing, that I couldn't help but be entranced by much of the events that happened. I found myself not caring for the lack of yaoi and just enjoyed the ride of the amazing plot. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I have to say that this is a fairly good anime and deserves a chance by many. To those who love a good story that can make you laugh and cry, this is highly recommended. And to those few yaoi fans who like maybe a little fluff, this is great for you. It's lovely and very heart-warming, though, be warned, it is also heart-wrenching as well. I have to say, I found myself crying at the end, though, I am a sab for stuff like this too. So my opinion on the cry and sad bits might be over-exaggerated.",

            "content": "No.6 was part of the first batch of anime I had acquired together with Noir, Kill la Kill, Attack on Titan and Another and was one that stayed unwatched for the longest but after watching it I realised waiting for this long was a grave mistake. Rarely do I come across something that manages to touch me as deeply as No.6 managed to, in its short runtime of eleven episodes.\r\nThe story takes place in the future after wars have ravaged most of the earth\u2019s surface and now people live in a few city-states which are built on the only habitable pieces of land left. Weare introduced to Shion a gifted young boy who one night provides refuge for Nezumi, a boy about his age, who is on the run from the authorities. He saves Nezumi\u2019s life and four years later when Shion is accused of conspiring against the state and is being disposed off, Nezumi helps him escape. Together they flee to outside the city limit where apparently people still live in the desolate environment. \\n\\n\r\nFirst off the site states that No.6 is a sci-fi and action anime and I have to say I could not disagree more with the later as there is little to no action during its runtime. The driving force behind No.6 are the characters and the relationships between them especially the relationship between Shion and Nezumi. Depth of the characters is amazing especially considering the extremely shortness of the anime. We can see one of the best portrayals of a society that is under complete surveillance, the most interesting thing is that most people are completely fine with the control as it allows for a leisurely life. The ending has to be one of the best I have seen in a while, the build-up in the final few episodes and the catharsis that comes in the end is just so well done and filled with emotion that I cried like a little bitch for the first time while watching anime. Well to sum it up the storytelling in No.6 is great.\\n\\n\r\nOur two main characters are great as well, they might lack a bit of backstory explanation especially in Nezumi\u2019s case as his motives are not explained well enough, but I have to say they are still amazingly well developed. The relationship between Nezumi and Shion has to be the highlight of the anime and is in my honest opinion one of the best I have ever seen in an anime. The way they first meet, and later form deep emotional bonds even though they have strictly different life views, with Nezumi\u2019s complete pessimism, lack of belief in humanity and the desire to destroy, while Shion wants change to come on the backs of the people in whom he believes are able to force the change. We have some other important characters that all bring something to the table and actually manage too help the story advance as well as deepen the bond between our two main characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was a bit disappointing as the whole thing looked a bit dull, but there were the occasional moments of complete beauty. The soundtrack on the other side was unbelievable, the background music choices were perfect and the moments where Nezumi sings were exceptional. The opening and ending were fantastic and fit the anime perfectly. The opening song \u201cSpell\u201d by the band \u201cLama\u201d sounds just otherworldly with some of the best this amazing instrumental introduction followed by some almost ethereal singing intertwined with great instrumental backing. The ending itself is also very close to perfect, with its soft vocals over some peaceful piano later evolving into this unbelievable uplifting song that manages to bring up the feelings felt throughout the anime. The end of the anime is where this all comes together to form one of the most stunning displays I have ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall No.6 has to be one of the best anime have seen in quite a while and while there were a few minor problems I am still able to give it a very high score of 9. I am currently seriously considering tracking down the light novels an giving them a try. I do recommend this anime to everyone and I urge you to see it if you haven't already, as it is really fantastic.\\n\r\nIf you have something to say about my review fell free to give some feedback and you can also see my growing collection of reviews.",

            "content": "\u201cIgnorance is Bliss.\u201d Many agree with such a term, many go against it, and many qualify it. This anime, \u201cNo. 6\u201d is one of those animes that really gets you thinking about it. Is living in eternal bliss without knowing what goes on under the surface the best way to live? What about rebelling against the gov\u2019t and risking your own life to save the ignorant minds of others? Would you want to be the righteous villain, or the guilty hero? Destroy or be destroyed? Survive, or die? Evil or Good? Black or White? No. 6 is really that type of anime that begs thesequestions. One doesn\u2019t just pick one or the other, would you risk finding a grey area and destroy yourself while trying to get there? The main characters, while also developing their friendship and supposed deeper relationship, face this conflict both within themselves and in their environment. Now, this anime hasn\u2019t gotten noticeable ratings, which I completely understand, but then again find hard to believe. This anime definitely has its flaws, but it still develops well around a nicely developed plot. Many find this anime by noticing its very familiar elements that are seen in popular animes around the world. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the plot, which I gave a solid 7. This anime takes place in a supposed \u201cutopia\u201d district known as \u201cNo. 6,\u201d the name creatively given for it being the 6th city in the walls of human habitat that was created after [Insert spoiler Here.] The story focuses on an intelligent boy named Shion who was born in No. 6 and had all of his privileges stripped from him after he saved the life of an escaped boy named Nezumi, or Rat.  Years later, Shion grows up to become a park manager in No. 6 and starts questioning the reality and legitimate nature of the city, only to be arrested for suggested suspicion of betrayal; and who rescues him? Nezumi, after 4 years. They go on to live in the western District outside the Walls of No. 6 which is where all of the rejects run away to and is considered to be one of the most dangerous places to reside. This all occurs while Nezumi and Shion begin to understand each other and develop a strong friendship and hinted relationship that is thought to be deeper than that. The plot is definitely a good idea on paper even though the \u201cdystopian society\u201d and \u201ctotalitarian\u201d genre is getting more and more popular every single year as anime continues to spread across America, and with only 11 episodes, they managed to fit it all in while adding the finer details. The best points of this plot were definitely the added contrasting elements. While the mood of the anime was supposed to be hopeless, depressing, and scary; the fact that Nezumi and Shion manage to find hope and have their friendship shine through really added to the plot. Also, the fluff in the anime, including the suggestive \u201cromance\u201d scenes b/w the two main protagonists, wasn\u2019t too overwhelming and it respected the fact that the anime was still a shounen. The problems with the plot seemed to focus around the fact that the anime was only 11 episodes long. If it was 12, or 13, like most, I think all of the holes in the plot would\u2019ve been resolved peacefully. I mean, I never found out the secret behind the bees, and the goals of the antagonists. I don\u2019t know if it was just me, but it was just too obvious to ignore. The plot was obviously rushed and that definitely took away from the plot, adding the fact that a lot was changed around compared to the manga. It took away the plot's potential even though it was such a good idea. \\n\\n\r\nWhile talking about the art, I might as well start off with the character designs. I\u2019d say they were creative, but I can\u2019t let go of the fact that Nezumi and Shion look so much like Allen and Kanda from D. Gray Man. Shion even has a pink scar in the same place Allen does. It\u2019s too obvious to let go. Other than that, though; I really admire the fact that each character is created with a specific personality in mind, and that personality was personified into the perfect figure. Shion is supposed to be this na\u00efve, innocent and pure, intelligent boy; so he was given white hair for purity, big eyes to represent his child like demeanor and good intentions, and dressed in comfortable, loose clothing to represent his comfortable and gentle character. Nezumi, on the other hand, was designed to be the exact opposite of that, given dark hair, sharp eyes, an d a dangerous smirk to represent his nickname as a \u201cdemon,\u201d (Given by Inukashi.) Normally in a shounen, I look for the beauty in action scenes, which there weren\u2019t very much of, unfortunately; but the setting and development of the anime as a whole along with the symbolism of the colors really fit the anime\u2019s character and added to contrast. They tried really hard to make \u201cNo. 6\u201d as pretty as possible in order to highlight the contradiction later on that accuses the city of being a living hell in its core. Overall, you can tell the art was looked at really well and carefully done. So for that, it gets a 9.\\n\\n\r\nSound-wise, I gave \u201cNo. 6\u201d a 9, as well. All of the tracks were very beautiful, especially the OST. As you may know, the anime has a very sad nature behind it, along with a hidden sliver of hope; the composers of the music for this anime paid very much attention to this detail and the result was perfection in the OST. The ending, I thought, was very beautiful. Much better than the opening, anyways, which seems to be the only flaw I can find in the music. I can\u2019t help but pull my hair out at the opening, which sounds like a child that just had throat surgery. It didn\u2019t fit the anime and just didn\u2019t do anything but cause annoyance. It\u2019s a shame considering the first thing one hears when they open a new anime IS the opening. \\n\\n\r\nLet me first point out that this anime had the perfect amount of characters. There weren\u2019t too many or too little. Also, the main protagonists of \u201cNo. 6\u201d were a couple of the best developed and most likeable characters I\u2019ve ever seen in anime. Their interactions, if you ask me, made up most of the best moments in the anime. Their arguments, which were hiding their secret admiration for each other, were genius additions. A lot of hate has been given to Shion in particular, after reading some forum discussions, for being too clingy and dependent on his partner, Nezumi. I find this to be quite legitimate, though; mainly for the reason of character development and added contrast. Nezumi wanted to break away from Shion in fear of becoming weaker; Shion wanted to get closer to Nezumi in order to become stronger. Shion is sometimes useless, but, if necessary, he can do a complete 180 and will even murder somebody when someone insults Nezumi. There is only one character that conflicts me regarding her purpose, and that was Safu. I mean, yeah, he [Insert Spoiler here], but I just found her completely useless and as extra baggage that caused a lot of struggle character-wise. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this anime a lot. It may seem clich\u00e9, but I\u2019m a sucker for subtle romance hints, yaoi or not. Also, my most favorite animes in the world are tearjerkers, like K, and FMA: Brotherhood, and D. Gray Man, etc. This anime definitely adds to that list. The ending brought tears to my eyes and if this was a score based off of pure enjoyment, I would give this anime a 10. Unfortunately, because of plot holes and obvious rushing in the plot due to major compression, I had to give the overall score a 9.\\n",

            "content": "No.6. An interesting name for a series; the air of ambiguity to it definitely sparked my interest. The series, a lot like the name, works with a palpable shroud of uncanniness, and it is something, of which, I have enjoyed about No.6.\r\nThe series takes place in a modernistic and seemly ideal society with futuristic technology. Protagonist Sion, grows up in the newly built, ideal city of No.6. All citizens wear ID wristbands that holds functionalities like that of cellphone, and the government tracks the movements of all inhabitants. Through-out the series, this \"big brother\"like world shows it's darker qualities.\r\nShion, age 12, grew up as aprivileged young boy, and is among the smartest of his age group, even so to be allowed to live in the elite area of \"Cronos\"; it is shown he has a bright future ahead of him.This all changes when he gives shelter to a strange boy, Nezumi, who later reveals himself to be an escaping criminal. Despite appearances, Shion clothes, feeds and helps Nezumi; the two have a clear bond. Nezumi vanishes the next day and leaves Shion with the trouble caused by harbouring an enemy of the state; Sion is stripped of his privileges and forced to move.\\n\\n\r\nFour years pass by and we see, a now 16 year-old, Shion as a park worker. He witnesses the mysterious death of his co-worker and is taken in my the Bureau of Security, only to be saved by Nezumi and taken to a post-apocalyptic-like setting known as \"Lost Town\".\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, the story works well. However, there are definitely moments that leave you scratching your head. The overarching involvement of a mysterious deity is one such instance, but other plot points like the corrupt nature of No.6 manage to balance out the near wackiness.\\n\\n\r\nHigh production values are definitely characteristic of Bones works and No.6 is no doubt part and parsel of the Bones experience. Backgrounds are very well done and animation manages to be fluid all around. I love the character design for Nezumi (Ponytails are edgy!), and for the most part, Shion, but the pink scar-ish thing  seems like they are just trying to give continuity and justify the reason he got his awesome white hair.\\n\\n\r\nHmmmm...the sound. While I love the opening for the series, a lot like the artwork, some of the backing tracks to scenes don't quite fit and feel out of place; this proves to distract from the overall impact of certain scenes. Some of the pieces are definitely done well and enjoyable; I am listening to \"Spell\"  (the opening) as I write :D.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Shion and Nezumi work well together. Both portray aspects of the other as well, this is something that other Anime tends to slip up on, that the characters all fit a set archetype and deviate little. Nezumi is a level-headed, frank and cynical person and Shion is innocent, naive but determined, this is putting it a little bluntly. The friendship that they bear is seemly unrequited, of course in saying this, they could be described as your typical odd couple; this is merely on the surface as the extent of their loyalty and similarities shines through even Nezumi cold words on society. It is a strange relationship, but it works and proves to be an interesting \"selling point\" of the series. And yes, there is a homosexual vibe to the whole ordeal, but it is so insignificant that it really doesn't even warrant this mention.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed No.6, the ending is a definite sucker punch, surprising and not in a good way, but even given that it is still something that warrants a look-in.",

            "content": "I had a feeling when I first spotted this anime that it'd be interesting, boy was I right.\r\n A city where everything is provided and you have no need to do anything for yourself. The ideal city No.6, sounds too good to be true doesn't it? Well of course it is and Shion figures that out first hand when he meets Nezumi a fugitive who manages escaped from a reformatory. From that day on his life is turned upside down. He learns that No.6 isn't as ideal and perfect as it once seemed. They say ignorance is bliss although Shion doesn't seem content tostay that way. \\n\\n\r\n I think the storyline itself is amazing. I have a hard time comparing it to anything I've ever watched before and because of that I don't know what to expect. I've only seen five episodes but if the storyline continues on as it is and manages to come to a conclusive ending without cutting it short it will be a masterpiece. This is not your every day, run off the mill, cliche anime we have here. Nope, this is an extraordinary piece of work. With every episode I watch I get even more absorbed into the show wondering what's going to happen next. \\n\\n\r\n Just a glance and you can tell that the artwork is visually stunning. I definitely have to applaud BONES for all the detail used here. They have truly great graphics. As for the sound the opening song was alright, I wasn't that impressed with it. I think the ending was better and it fits well with the anime. \\n\\n\r\nRight from the start we got some great character development. Here we have this mysterious fugitive Nezumi who hates No.6 and seems to know something about it that nobody else does. He's rude, straightforward, anti sociable and yet seems to be a fairly decent person. Then we have Shion, hes kind, has a strong sense of justice, understands people, and just like Nezumi he seems to be surrounded by mystery. You wouldn't think so but just when you think you've got Shion all figured out they do something to change that later in the story.\\n\\n\r\n I am thoroughly enjoying this anime and it has the best potential I've seen in awhile. No.6 may just become one of my favorites. Overall I'd give this anime a 9/10. The only problem I have is the music, it isn't awful but it isn't outstanding ether. Those of you who don't like yaoi don't worry, this isn't yaoi if anything Shion and Nezumi have more of a sibling relationship. So I definitely recommend No.6. \\n\\n",

            "content": "This is one of the few anime that have made my cry just because it's ended. One of my only major complaints is that this series isn't longer.\r\nThe story is very interesting, and actually pretty realistic in a sense. The future very well could be like this, so it gets you thinking.\r\nThe first episode really drew me in. It was magical, in a sense. While I was a bit disappointed that the rest of the series is different (meaning, not so \"magical\"), I can still call this a great anime.\r\nLet's start with the bad things first. This, of course, is just my opinion, so youmay find what I choose to be \"wrong.\" \\n\r\nAnyway, this anime consists of a lot of dialogue. Now, the dialogue was fine and very informative, but a little more action would have been nice. \\n\r\nI thought the pace was great, but a lot more have could have happened. Even though this series is only 11 episodes long, not very much seemed to happen. Still, I can't call this a boring anime.\\n\r\nWhile there was some nice character development between the two main characters, we didn't get to really focus in on the others. Sure, every \"important\" character gets decent screen time, but we don't see much development with those characters. This, too, isn't a huge issue either, though.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's move on to the good things!\\n\r\nTo me, this isn't a boring anime because of the thought-provoking plot and the development of the two main characters. Shion and Nezumi are very different, and so it starts to become a bit predictable that they will argue about pretty much everything. Still, it's hard not to love these characters and see how they bounce off of each other.\\n\r\nWhile there are some shonen-ai like scenes, there isn't a romance. Some might disagree with me, however. Even if you don't like shonen-ai, you shouldn't give up on this anime. Shion's and Nezumi's \"moments\" are short and not all that romantic. Eh, you'll have to decide for yourself.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was pretty amazing. I, at first, didn't really like the opening theme, but it really grew on me. The ending theme is beautiful. The music used during the anime can be very powerful and is used pretty much perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty nice. I really have no complaints here, although there are a couple of times in the anime where the artists seem to get lazy. However, it doesn't happen much and can be easily overlooked. There are also times where the art is truly beautiful, too.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is give-and-take. There are some great action sequences, though most of the anime consists of the characters sitting around or standing still. This isn't bad, but you don't have a lot of movement. The animation is very smooth and nice, though, especially in the first and last episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime and loved watching it. Some of the scenes are just so powerful. While I guess there is nothing too amazing about this anime, it provoked a lot of emotion from me, and I love it. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good and thought-provoking story.\\n",

Because of this I have always recommended that anyone who has asked me to read the manga or novels first. The anime is well done, but does not nearly meet the quality of the original novel or its manga.\r\nBONES did well, although the studio missed several important points that were essential to the plot and characters. In their adaptation, the first three episodes are exciting and interesting. They raise questions and create attachments to the main characters. Unfortunately, by the fourth episode andso forth until episode eight, the story loses importance.  The plot becomes mundane and, while the main characters are lovable and cute, the anime becomes uninteresting. We learn very little during these episodes, leaving far too many questions unanswered until much, much later. \\n\r\nThe characters are wonderful, and have to be my favorite part of the entire anime. Although Shion is rather cliche at first, we later learn that he is much more complex than just a naive, gentle teenager. \\n\r\nNezumi (Rat), is also likable. While cold and aloof, we later learn the reasons beneath his jaded and hateful demeanor. \\n\r\nIn short, No.6 (anime) is a decent adaption of the novels. However, I STRONGLY recommend that you first read the original story, or at least the manga. These are very well written, and have everything that the anime failed to create.",

            "content": "A masterpiece of sci-fi.  An intelligent bromance.  A suspenseful dystopian story.  Or so it could have been.\r\nUnfortunately, it's waterlogged with confusing and improbable assumptions, and the thing it does best is the angst.  But having two teen boys bicker like a bitter middle-aged couple gets tiring after a while.  I have a sneaking suspicion that the writer (of either the original novel, or of the anime script) is a 16-year-old who thinks bromance angst is the coolest thing, and added some random sci-fi and fantasy and a few tropes to make it look cool, because that's just\u2026\u2026.cool.  Who caresif it makes any sense.\\n\\n\r\nWe start off in a utopian society, known as \"Number 6.\"  Our main character, Sion, is just a young kid, but is on the fast-track for a great future.  But then he smashes that when he decides to tend the wounds of a boy named Nezumi, who stumbles into his house one night.  Nezumi is an escaped convict.  But Sion, in the goodness of his heart, treats him anyway.  (The amazingly smart kid \"knows the theory\" of stitching wounds, fortunately.)  As punishment, Sion and his mother are kicked out of the smarty-pants district, and into the area of No. 6 that is for common people.   And now they both have to work for a living.\\n\\n\r\nThen comes the insect infestation!  A few people start to suddenly age, drop dead, and have bee-like insects crawl out of their age spots.  Yuck.  This happens to Sion's co-worker.  And since everyone in this story assumes the obvious, Sion is arrested for murder.  But, lucky him, Nezumi comes to the rescue of our damsel (er, lad) in distress and takes him to the land outside of No. 6, which is a giant garbage dump, and which lots of people call home.  Including Nezumi.  Sion wants to go back to No. 6 and help find a cure for the carnivorous bees.  But Nezumi doesn't want him to.  Because he hates No. 6.\\n\\n\r\nThat's about as far as the plot makes sense.  \\n\\n\r\nI know animes often don't explain everything.  Many of the \"art house\" series make it a point to be vague.  But this one isn't trying to be artistic.  Rather, it seems like someone tried to follow a template for success.  \\n\\n\r\nLots of stories try to do that.  Like a harem anime has certain kinds of characters (the loli, the little sister, the peppy girl, the nerdy girl, the lusty girl, the tsundere girl, etc.) and certain kinds of situations (a visit to the beach, guy tripping and landing on top of a girl with a hand on her\u2026\u2026you-know-what).  \\n\\n\r\nThis one tries to do something like that too.   \\n\\n\r\nHaving two main characters who are polar opposites is cool?  Let's do that.  \\n\r\nHaving them argue, wrestle, shove each other around, and kiss a couple times will excite a certain segment of fangirls?  Let's do that.  \\n\r\nTragic past?  Check.  \\n\r\nLeader of an underground resistance movement?  Check.  \\n\r\nTerrible plague/infestation that the main character nobly wishes to remedy?  Check.  \\n\r\nKidnapped childhood friend?  Check.  \\n\r\nMysterious goddess-spirit of nature?  Check.  \\n\r\nGrand climactic ending? Check. \\n\r\nPartner in misery? Check. \\n\r\nBad guys in suits?  Check.  \\n\r\nEvil laboratory?  Check.  \\n\r\nNoble death?  Check.  \\n\r\nWhite hair? Check.\\n\r\nBody scars? Check.\\n\r\nBlood?  Check.  \\n\r\nAction? Check. \\n\r\nAnimals? Check. \\n\\n\r\nNow, none of these things are bad.  If you know how to use them; if they work together to make a cohesive, compelling story.  But here they don't.  They're all tossed together like a salad, and even if you liked the original ingredients, somehow they don't taste good together.  \\n\\n\r\nLike I said before, it seems immature.  \\n\\n\r\nNotice I gave this a rating of 7, which is still fairly high.  The OP and animation are nice.  The sci-fi slightly-in-the-future setting is interesting, and the characters are generally non-stereotypical.  It feels unusual.  Dystopian series seem mostly reserved for mature audiences, and girl-appealing sci-fis are not common.  It's OK for a light weekend splurge if you don't know what else to watch, and you want to see if you are the one who will finally crack the puzzle of this anime.  And maybe there is a good solution and resolution, and it can be understood by the brilliant.  I will give it the benefit of the doubt.  Like with Moby Dick, rumor has it there are people who \"get it.\"\\n\\n\r\nBut I think the people who will still love the series by the time they get to the end will be hardcore yaoi fangirls.  Because yaoi animes are scarce, and they have to take what they can get.  (No, this isn't a yaoi, but certain scenes will make them say it's close enough.)  Oh, it starts out good.  Nice animation, interesting setting.  It had all the makings of an interesting story.  But it doesn't maintain it.  It just keeps throwing things at you, trying to convince you that it's intelligent and cool.\\n\\n\r\nIt keeps adding more and more things to thicken the plot.  And I kept waiting for them to pan out or be explained.  Finally, I got to the last episode, and figured everything would finally be explained.  But the most it did was throw even more confusing stuff at me. \\n\\n\r\nSorry folks, that's not cool.",

            "content": "\"Let there be shining lights in the starless sky\" - No. 6 ending (song)\r\nWell, the story takes place in - *rataplan* - No. 6; an ideal and perfect City, without starvation, without wars and everything you need is right there. The only thing: the city is surrounded by walls.\r\nSoon after the start we're introduced to one of the mains; Shion. A curious, naive young Boy who lives in no. 6. One night he lets a strange, injured boy into his house - and this boy is revealed as the second main named Nezumi (Side note: Nezumi is the jap. word for Rat). \r\nOf course isShion interested in Nezumi - who would not if hardly nothing happens in your life and everything seem to be predictable - and that is point where the story starts.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting was very nice indeed and gives the show a cool atmosphere. But yet, it takes almost the entire show to get the answer for questions such as \"why it was built like this?\", \"why does Nezumi try to destroy it?\", \"why...\" \"what...\" \"how...\" and so on. \\n\\n\r\nSome parts of the story were extremly predictable, whereas others weren't at all; the Kiss for instance. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was alright, but not outstanding. The same for the characters. They were memorable, but not special at all. They were explained, but at times I felt I was missing out something. Perhaps the novels have or give a better explanation. I assume that they would since 9 volumes were published. However, I did like Nezumis style most, followed by Inukashi \"Dogkeeper. I think they gave a nice impression of how life could actually look like if you were an outsider.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing what I extremely enjoyed was the attention for details in the background - the leafs moving in the wind, the light behind tiny windows far away - which gave the anime such a great atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nBut, without a doubt, the animes strongest point was the Art/Sound. The sound of rain or wind for instance are very well done and the voices fitted the characters nicely.\\n\r\nThe opening and especially the ending theme can be easiely described with one word: awesome! I became a huge fan of the ending theme because of the very nice sound and the beautiful lyrics. But I also liked the sound during the show - there were times when it was bizarre, there were times when it was quite soft - and I found myself paying more attention to the sound than the show. Having said that, I personally think I only keep the anime in my mind because of the sound.\\n\\n\r\nSo how shall I rate this anime? After considering all these points I would give the anime 7/10 rather than 6/10, just because of the sound.",

It's not a matter of need and want, I absolutely MUST watch the next episode or I'm going to die. That's how much I love this anime. It's funny really, I didn't even mean to watch this anime either, and I most definitely didn't think I was going to like it. Well It's probably one of my favorite anime's now, and it's not even finished yet! God it's killing me how much I want to watch the next episode,and there's STILL ANOTHER EPISODE AFTER THAT ONE! \\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say about No.6? The story line is amazing about pretty much how Shion this guy helped a felon named Nezumi which means Rat (yes I'm serious that's his name) when he was 12 and got in some trouble and then years later the secrets of No.6 (the city he lives in) are pretty much revealed to him as well as he gets banished from No.6 and lives in the outskirts of the city with Nezumi the felon he saved. Then pretty much he wants to save No.6 from these parasite bees at the same time that he wants reunite with his mother, save his friend from the correctional facility, AND break down the wall of No.6 so there's no barriers and everyone's the same.  \\n\\n\r\nArt, the art's beautiful. The way they gave Shion 2 different looks was amazing. When he lives in No.6 he has brown hair and is pretty normal, and then when he escapes and lives with Nezumi and is saved from being killed by the parasite bee that tries to inhabit him, his hair turns white, his eyes look more red and he gets this pink scar that wraps all around his body. Nezumi, looks really beautiful and mysterious with his glowing eyes and dark hair. The scenery is beautiful, even the disgustingness of the outside of No.6 is really cool looking.  \\n\\n\r\nSound, I love the music in this anime. It's really beautiful and actually kind of painful for me. The opening song \"Spell by Lama\" just has this air about it that makes me want to cry. It sort of fits Shion, he's this really nice and caring guy who lives in this horrible city/world. The song feels too nice almost to fit the darkness of the anime and that's why it's so perfect. Plus the singing that Nezumi does in the anime as well as how sad the closing song sounds. The sound is very perfect. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter, I've kind of covered this. There's Shion the main characters that gets into trouble for saving Nezumi when he was 12, and then years later he gets in trouble again once he discovers the parasite bees and Nezumi  saves him. Shion is a really caring guy whos nice to everyone and a bit nieve, Nezumi is a mysterious guy with a dark aura about him. He seems like an angry guy, but you can tell he cares about Shion. There's Shion's Mom, who is one of the people who created No.6 which is pretty big and Safu a childhood friend of Shion's, she actually gets taken to the correctional facility and something crazy happens with her. Pretty much all the characters are really cool, and theres way more I didn't mention but they're very important in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, this anime has addicted me and I'm going through withdrawals with waiting for the next episode. It's soooo entertaining because stuff KEEPS HAPPENING and you just can't keep yourself from watching once you start. I love this anime!!!\\n\\n\r\nMy overall score is 10 because I love it that much ;)",

What really sets it above a rating of merely \"good\" is the character design and story content.\r\nIf you're here you probably already know that No.6 features a gay relationship between the two protagonists, Shion and Rat. If you are a reasonable and accepting person in the year of 2018, you can enjoy this relationship regardless of your own sexual orientation. Shion and Rat are written as representations of optimistic and cynical ideologies in the face of a clearly flawed world order. Yes they are both male, but this animeavoids all the trappings of oversexualizing the relationship or playing the \"will they wont they\" game for the entirety of the show.\\n\\n\r\nYes there are some open ends in the story, but when the show is limited to 11 episodes in length it's unreasonable to expect complete closure. For the most part, everything is explained as much as it needs to be. If, in the 11 given episodes, things like the mysticism of the center of the city were focused on more this show would not have shined as much as it did. The only thing that really could have done with a little more development is Shion's mother's involvement in the creation of No.6' status quo.\\n\\n\r\nGive this show a watch.

But it went off track and died, real fast. This show took on more than it could chew and ended up destroying itself. \r\nThe pacing works for the start of the show, but at the half-point it feels as the studio realized \"Crap, we are out of time\" and shoved a dozen of undeveloped, and sometimes even un-introduced concepts, for the rest of the show's duration. It dished out way too many side-plots & characters but didn't provide any meaning to them, letalone the fact the show just kind of 'ends' without solving anything. Hell, it may be the worst anime ending I've seen, and anime isn't exactly known for it's good endings.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of this show required 110 episodes, not 11- and it was outright terrible because of it. Sometimes simple is best, No.6 Proves that if nothing else.",

I usually binge animes with up to 24 episodes in a day, but this 11 episode anime, made me take my time, something I never do. Even with my favorites with up to 100 episodes, I've binged in days. But this anime, really, was so perfect in so manydifferent ways, there's this feelings you get after finishing a really great book or series,  and that's the feeling I got from this anime. The ending, with Nezumi and Shion parting ways, and the cliffhanger left on if they'll ever see each other again is a masterpiece. The sadness I felt seeing Karan race to see her son, made me actually cry. This anime is a hidden classic, and deserves much higher praise and a much great audience than it has gotten.

For starters, the story, although dystopian future is a common category for animes, really hit it out of the park in my opinion. It was very original and I don't think I've ever come across a plot line quite like this one. The art and animation style is one I enjoy personally, and don't even get me started on the music. The intro and outro music were gorgeous pieces. The characters were so dynamic the whole series and honestly I got very emotional near the end. Theywere very easy to get attached to. Another point that I really thought was worth noting about this anime is the relationship between Shion and Nezumi. It's the first time in an anime with an action/sci-fi genre to have a homosexual romantic (or so watchers assume to be romantic) relationship added into the story, without tagging it as yaoi or bl, or using it as queer baiting. It really made this anime all the more unique and enjoyable, and simply outstanding. 10/10 in my books, I would recommend.",

Shion sees good in people, and if that innocence is put aside by another person who experienced so much pain and lost, everything starts getting messy. Lol, yeah that's it, that's allI could squeeze out of my brain. Definitely you should check it out.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way opening and ending song is 10/10, amazing!",

Although the anime is not the same as the novel and left many things out and they may have toned down the BL, it\u2019s not a horrible anime. The story itself is very\u2026.refining you could say, in the sense that both protagonists are very loyal to each other, showing friendship at its full glory. It shows how much it meant to Nezumi that Shion saved him 4 years ago, and how important kindness is. Okay, so I\u2019m rambling a bitso back to story. I haven\u2019t watched all the anime in the world or even come close to it, but it has a unique story with an appealing \u2018world approaching apocalyptic event\u2019 feel and the art is wonderful. The character development isn\u2019t too bad either. So if you\u2019re one of those people that have seen the trailer and become intrigued, then watch it. Don\u2019t let bad reviews put you off. And if you end up liking it, then awesome. If not, then go write a review about it. You shouldn\u2019t really watch anime based on reviews anyway because many of them can be biased and be based on personal taste. Overall 8/10 :)",

But then it seems to lose its way in the latter half of the anime. I was incredibly confused by the ending. I actually did ask myself 'Wait, what? Is that it?' when episode 11 finished, because I kind of believed that the streaming had crashed and I was missing a big chunk ofthe ending. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are so-so. I didn't quite understand the relationship between Nezumi and Shion, and Shion was rather irritating with his 'I'll not think for myself, I'm just gonna follow around this guy with the ponytail, he's ruined my family's life, trusting him is a good idea'. Nezumi seemed like a mysterious character at first, but the more that was revealed about him, the more bored I became. They're bearable, though. Safu, Shion's best friend was actually a breath of fresh air. Forward and knows what she wants. Unlike almost everyone else in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, towards the end I got pretty tired of the love/hate relationship between Shion and Nezumi, and was extremely disappointed with the ending altogether.",

So it's an interesting story, maybe not developed enough. \r\nArt 9/10\r\nThe artis awosome, drawings and animation are very great and there are some little things, animated with care, which add feeling and give the viewer time to think about the implications of the story. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nOpening and ending are beatiful and full of feelings; the soundtrack is great - there are some piano pieces which are awsome - and it fits the moment.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\r\nThe character are well designed, they have personality.. but this anime lacks of interior monologues, the thoughts of the characters are not expressed enough and as a result the actions they made aren't always clear, sometimes it seems like they act incoherently with their personality. You need to have a  good comprehension of human behavior to understand what lies under their appearance.

            "content": "Basic Facts:\r\n- Contains a highly suggestive (nay, canon), meaningful, and wonderfully crafted relationship between two men.\r\n-There's no face to the bad side in this story.\r\n- Convoluted storyline that tried to juggle a post apocalyptic false utopia and magical forest shenanigans in 11 episodes.\r\n- Imbalance in character development. Some side characters are more fleshed out than main characters. \r\nWell, that was a nice summation of what I'd like to discuss. Let me start with the bad stuff.\r\nThe storyline in this anime is horrendous. As soon as they start weaving in complications into the story, I threw in the towel. No.6 threw crisp, polished, and frightening socialviews and technological and historical progression at us, only to end this story on a note that contributes nothing to the original premise - Rather it's this glorified idea of unity and status and - goodness - the magic of the earth or some shit like that. It was hard to follow the amount of pure BS that was overflowing on my screen since episode 8/9. If you're someone who doesn't buy easily into sketchy plot twists, you would be turned off rather quickly.\\n\\n\r\nAnother BIG BAD THING, is that the anime sends a worrying and highly flawed message. When talked about, No.6 always comes off as this big and evil single entity that sucks from the earth to create a false positive. That, my friends, is wrong. No.6's GOVERNMENT is the one behind the lies and cruelty, not the whole city. The show often talks down to the city's citizens, whose biggest crime is essentially ignorance. They are innocent people who are at best lying to themselves about the state of the city, and at worst are utterly spoiled by its lies. Either way, their crimes are nothing to be vary of. Yet the show, when mentioning No.6 as a single evil entity includes its citizens in that description, essentially creating this philosophical idea about greed, which puts the citizens in an equally bad spot as the people running the city.\\n\\n\r\nWhat then happens, is that deaths of innocent people are being glorified to support a flawed idea about greed, environment, and industrialization, and leaves a bad taste in your mouth. By giving a face to the city, a Big Bad (which existed in the manga, making it the superior version in more ways than one), I as the viewer would know where to point fingers, and the whole message would make more sense, if only to a certain point. Alas, that doesn't exist.\\n\\n\r\nFinal MEH thing, is Safu. Honestly, I don't know what's her point. I mean, she felt like she HAD a point, but it was never made. That was a big problem. Safu was written as an important, front-row character, yet we know more about her grandmother than we do about her. We know more about Inukashi that we know about her. She's left out to play a love interest yet is not a love interest like, at all, and in the end was the most useless scapegoat I have ever seen. Safu was an utter disappointment of a character, and I wish they either gave her a normal storyline, or didn't make a big thing out of her in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nNow to the GOOD STUFF!\\n\r\nFirst off, no matter what anyone tells you, the relationship between Nezumi and Shion is hardly EVER fan service. I will take that to my grave, people.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the amount of times Nezumi and Shion share a cutesy moment together is a bit hard to count, since it's the main thing in focus. But, even so, every interaction has a meaning, it's what I love most about their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nEvery look and every touch and every moment, essentially, send a big message. It might be hard to see at first, but I assure you, if you watch it again you'll know what I mean. What is weaved between Nezumi and Shion is nothing I have ever seen in an anime. It's a friendship that surpasses all comfort zones and doesn't hold a candle to any generic idea of how they're supposed to be around each other. The amount of pure CARE that they project is heartbreaking, and is never cheap.\\n\\n\r\nI will say this, though. Some scenes are drawn to look more superficially appealing than others. I believe the polishing and dreamy presentation of a certain dancing scene is a big example of that - but even with that 'shippy' feeling, the meaning is not lost. Nezumi and Shion share a complex bond weaved with doubt, love, and twisted dependency - it's a treat to watch. \\n\\n\r\nI will repeat this again, none of this is FAN SERVICE. Fan service is when things are meant to look a certain way for no other reason than to appease the fans. Well made fan service will provide some character development along with it. No.6 provides intimate moments which are our main source of true understanding of the main characters. It couldn't have been done as well in any other way - we wouldn't have gotten such a good read on them have they only ever just... TALKED. So, not fan service.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL WORDS would be... Well, this is worth your time, if only to end up in a weird laugh/sob situation because the finale is a shit-pile of emotions and bad messages. If you're someone who enjoys a fresh take on characters, you should love this. If you love this already, do yourself a favor and go read the manga and the novel. It'll make the experience much better, I promise.",

It has just enough hints in each episodes to make the story mysterious. I don't like shows with excessive symbolism or wacky events all over the place unless it's a parody. No.6 has just the right amount of character interactions along with a reasonably paced progression that makes this one of those watchable shows these days. \r\nAs for the characters, they are believable. Rat and Sion are realistic characters. They are not one of those wannabe freaks sopopular these days. Sion is pretty pathetic, but if you are one of those people who enjoy characters that walk around like a dying ninja turtle or drunken robot, don't bother coming close to this show. Rat is short-tempered and protective. Yes, it's quite stereotypical, but most human beings are like that. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the art and sound, they are good, especially in the first episode. Overall it's a nicely paced show with believable characters and settings. I wish it could be longer though, but maybe they can round up the story in 11 episodes. \\n\\n",

            "content": "No.6 has always been one of my favourite manga series (and probably always will be) but the anime seriously lacked in the depth and horror of the light novel story. It seems the creators shied away from the gore and horror of the novels to get a lower age rating, and that really messed with the story. What should really have been a 25 episode anime, was condensed down into a mere 11 episodes, meaning that key plot and character development was missed.\r\nStory - The story was gripping and intense from the first episode up to, well, the third episode. The first three episodes werealmost identical to the light novel story and manga and were paced brilliantly. However, it seemed that after 3 of the 11 total episodes had been spent so quickly, the producers decided to cram the rest into the remaining 7 episodes, leaving many important moments out and skipping on character development and detail. One scene that really stuck out to me was in episode 7 (I think), when (SPOILER) Shion kissed Nezumi. In the light novels, Nezumi curls into a ball and cries afterward and it's an important character moment. In the anime, it just doesn't happen. \\n\\n\r\nThe order is also switched around in a way that makes character motivations seem petty without the right amount of development in the right order.\\n\\n\r\nArt - Honestly, the quality of the art and animation is exactly what I would expect from this studio. It's beautiful and fluid and the character designs blend seamlessly into their environment. The first episode is beautiful and the trend continues right up until the finale. In the damn FINALE, the production value takes a nosedive. One of the last scenes is jerky and at an extremely odd angle. \\n\\n\r\nSound - The sound is what makes this anime! It's brilliant and it fits so well with the mood and tone of the scenes. This may be an unpopular opinion, but the opening sequence is one of my favourite openings that I've ever seen and it really works with the anime. And the voice acting? Shion's death scream in episode 3 is astounding, the voice actors really outdid themselves here!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - I'd really love to give a high score here, especially because in the novels the character development was so good, but the development here is simply a case of 'welp, fair enough'. Nezumi's motivations and emotions are the real big blank space. In the novels we get to see a lot of development for him, but the anime barely gets past 'he has a traumatic backstory and he cares about Shion'. It's a real issue, especially since he seems like more of an asshole because of it. In the novels, he gets to come to terms with himself, and realise how badly he's treated other people, but in the anime barely any of that is explored.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Despite the quarrels I have with this as an adaptation, as a standalone series, I seriously enjoyed it. I had to accept that it wasn't really the same as the light novels, but, after that, I grew to love it as a series. I loved watching Nezumi and Shion interact with each other and the story, so I was never bored watching it! While it does take some time to get to the juicy bits about the city, the domestic moments in between help to prevent it from being too dark, and keep all kinds of fans interested. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like sci-fi, shounen ai or fantasy- this series can be something that you will enjoy! While it may be a bad adaptation, by itself it manages to work and do something great. I can honestly say that I'll probably never forget this anime and that it, and its message, will stick with me for life.",

            "content": "No. 6 has an interesting concept that I wanted to get into, but with only 11 episodes it inevitably felt rushed wire to wire and there were a number of difficult to ignore plot holes that really took away from my overall enjoyment of the show. With an episode count in the range of 16 or so I can't help but wonder what could have been...\r\nArt-\r\nThe visuals were somewhere between average and above average at any given time. At no point was the show flashy, and that's fine, but it was never ugly either. In particular the intro and outro sequences were really pretty. Backgroundsin some scenes lacked detail.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nThere are a couple of scenes where one of the main characters sings and those for me were undeniably the most memorable moments in terms of the sound. Beyond those moments, I found the rest of the soundtrack, while never blatantly bad, very average and forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting felt pretty average too. I really disliked Rat's voice acting in the English dub in particular, but that's more because he constantly came off like a total jerk and the character felt very unlikable for me as opposed to the performance itself being bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\\n\r\nWith 11 episodes character development will inevitably suffer and it did. There are maybe half a dozen total characters in the entire show with a name worth remembering and there are, at most, two you'll still remember after the show. In fact, the ONLY two characters approaching \"properly developed\" (and I'm not convinced they got there, but they were definitely the furthest along) were the two leads, with all the supporting characters, important or not, seriously lacking. As stated in my opening paragraph, I feel 11 episodes was simply not enough for what this show was trying to do and this is one of the key areas most negatively effected by this decision.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is the same deal. Liked it. Good concept. But, it was undeniably rushed and the final two episodes had a lot of plot holes and problems.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to like this show, and I felt like I could have, but there just weren't enough episodes, not enough character development and too many plot holes and inconsistencies for me to get there. I'm glad I watched this show but I wouldn't want to watch it again and I'd be pretty \"meh\" about recommending it to someone else.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nThe potential was here, but opting for only 11 episodes proved to be a fatal mistake and what could have been a very good show ended up being quite rushed and mediocre.\\n\\n\r\n+Genuinely interesting story concept\\n\r\n+Shameless, respectfully done homosexual relationship between the two leads\\n\\n\r\n-Lack of character development beyond the two leads\\n\r\n-Rushed from start to finish\\n\r\n-Plot holes, inconsistencies and highly unlikely/unrealistic moments\\n\r\n-One of the safest, take no risks, most cliche endings I've ever seen\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- 6\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- Strong 5/Weak 6",

But when I actually got down to watching it, I realized it was so much more than that, and hardly even revolved around romance (let alone yaoi).\r\nNormally, it\u2019ll take me at least a week to finish even a short anime. Yet I was so infatuated with No. 6 that I watched all 11 episodes in one day. I watched the English dub since I\u2019m toolazy to read subs, and although the dubbing was nothing extraordinary I can\u2019t say it was horrible overall. Besides, I focused on the plot and characters instead.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a majority of the characters were developed fabulously. I am particularly in love with Rat- his story, his personality\u2026 I also absolutely adore Dog Keeper. Certainly one of my favorite characters. The only character I could not bring myself to like was Safu. Nonetheless, I\u2019m perfectly content with how the story ended for her. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the sprinkle of romance included; how it didn\u2019t overpower the plot, without leaving the viewer completely disappointed with the lack of it. Although I personally would have loved to see Rat and Shion be admittedly in love, I\u2019m totally content with how their relationship actually was. (Another couple I would have loved to see form is Dog Keeper and Rikiga, but I\u2019m sure that\u2019s a very unpopular opinion.) As for the ending\u2026 It gave me a chance to dry my tears, I\u2019ll say that much. It was far from a fairytale happy ending, but still not so tragic that it hurt. Yes, I would have liked to know what happened next, yet it ended in a good place. Perhaps it\u2019s a good thing to be uninformed of, for example, what becomes of the baby left in Shion\u2019s care, or if Shion and Rat ever do meet again. The viewer can be free to assume whatever they\u2019d like, and that\u2019s a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I\u2019d rate it an 8.5/10, maybe even a 9. Despite only being 11 episodes, I don\u2019t think the plot was rushed at all, and the story successfully completed itself. I would highly recommend this anime for anyone into the idea of futuristic dystopians, and prepared to shed a few tears.",

            "content": "When I first started to watch No. 6, I was afraid of a sad ending and thus debated whether to watch it at all. But I'm very glad I did. \r\nNo. 6 is a touching story of two young boys from two very different worlds. It displays a clear picture of the differences between the ignorant and blissful inside world and the rough reality of the outside world. The story revolves around the city called No. 6 and as the story progresses, the city's secrets begin to be revealed. Without spoiling anything I'll move on to my opinions.\r\nThe world of No. 6 is built strongand everything works. The shabby run-down Western outskirts make a great contrast to the utopian futuristic world of No. 6. The story is great and fits the created world perfectly. It has a lot of dark aspects to it and adds a lot to the thrill! \\n\\n\r\nThe art is excellent too. The backgrounds are always magnificent and detailed and the animation was great, as expected from BONES. Action scenes were pretty neat, though not the best you can find. The background music wasn't that memorable, but it suited the atmosphere every time. I was overjoyed every time the other main character, Nezumi, sang. The opening and ending themes and the animation were really good and fit the story better than well! I also really loved the character designs. And not only did the characters look excellent, but they were probably one of the strongest parts in the series! \\n\\n\r\nBoth the main characters Nezumi and Shion are very different and nicely balanced but they also change each other. The character development during these 11 episodes is amazing and yet very realistic. There is affection between these two and whether to be considered platonic or not depends entirely on the viewer. For myself, however, I find them to have little romantic feelings for each other. Not for the fact that I like boys together but it actually feels right and suits the story. However this show is often considered as yaoi or shonen ai, but in fact, it's either. Most definitely not yaoi but the shonen ai part depends a little on the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nAs a reviewer I gave the whole a 9. Not because of pure math (final 9,4), not even because it would lack anything. But when it comes to recommending this series, I can't guarantee that _everybody_ would find it as good as I did. Most people probably do though.\\n\\n\r\nMy personal score for this series is a 10 and I rarely rate anything 10 because that would mean the series is perfect and flawless. However everything in No. 6 works and the impression it left on me was, well, perfect. Considering the small amount of characters and the length, it still managed to build a great story. I felt really emotional at the end and would have wished for more episodes, but why try to construct on a building that is already clean and finished?",

The characters were also incredibly likable. For instance, no matter how good a group of characters are, I can usually pick out the one who I like best, but in this, Isimply cannot decide whether I like cocky Nezumi or gentle Shion better. \\n\\n\r\nSigh. I guess I'll just have to add both of them to my favourite characters list.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was very fitting, and I specially love the pieces sung by Nezumi. Yes, he can actually SING. Now do you understand why he's in my favourites list? LOL\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd recommend this to everyone. It's not a long series (only 11 episodes), so it's not one of those you have to put some serious thought into before starting. No. 6 is a bit of everything: there's plenty action (especially in the end), there are funny moments... Hell, it's even shounen-ai, for those who are into that (*raises hand*).\\n\\n\r\nI dare you to watch this and not enjoy it.",

First episode was pretty sweet, the futuristic world and the gadgets they used was boss. \r\nAs the show went on, I started questioning the main character's sexuality, it just seemed fishy.... Then episode 6 came along and BAM! He's gay. \r\nI got Juked out by it because it seemed like a normal love between his childhood friend from the first few episodes and her wanting sex. Anyways, I don't have anything wrong withthe two main characters being gay with each other, but it just really surprised me. I was speculating it, but I thought it would be one of those really bro friend animes like Naruto and Sasuke.\\n\\n\r\nAs I continue to watch, the plot was super interesting but starts to slow down by a lot, and has a LOT of fan service baits hidden around every episode. I was fine with that, just because it was interesting.\\n\\n\r\nNow, why I gave this a 6 was because overall as a show (the gay stuff didn't really impact the score at all) was just mediocre. The show starts slowing down in the middle.  The build up for the finale was well done, like how they showed us the dangers of the virus and why the society was so corrupt; When it finally GETS to the finale, that is when it all goes down hill.\\n\\n\r\nIt was really rushed, really really rushed. They pulled a lot of bullshit too, it made me smack myself for how much a cop out the story ended up being.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, 6/10, but the show was entertaining enough for me to finish all the episodes. \\n\\n",

This series had an entertaining plot, smooth art, unique characters, and strong emotions.  I looked forward to every episode and am sad to have it come to an end.\r\nThe plot had a few twists and turns but followed a very focal point the intire series, although Shion constantly was analyzing his options the plot was focused.  This gave the intire series direction and allowed the audience to generate opinions and scenarios to their objective.  To me this gave more depthto the anime as you feel you are constantly looking at each situation and bit of information and relating it to No. 6.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was good, but not spectacular.  In this pristine world I had hoped to see a more drastic difference from the inside of No 6 to the outside, also the backgrounds were often lined against the large wall of the city which sometimes felt like a cop out on the backgrounds line.  Yes, I realize it is situated around a walled city, however I still felt depth lacked.  Ex: Darker than Black revolved around a walled city yet there was a more expansiveness feeling artistically.  The character movements, panoramic scenes, and lighting was very smooth and had feeling of realism to most of the shots.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters were unique and all being affected by one of the best well contrived protagonists of anime, though more of an entity, the city itself.  This unique form of evil causes the characters to progress at their own paces as they are confronted with bits and pieces of information and generate their own thoughts.  From revenge, to sadness, to confirmationists all different types of people are protrayed and it is interesting to see what each conclusion / solution is generated.\\n\\n\r\nTo me No. 6 was a very entertaining and suspensful series which I highly recommend.  All aspects of the series were very well blended to make this a great series of the 2011 year.  I think this will be an anime to take up ranks with Deadman Wonderland as one of the years greats.\\n\\n\r\nRated 9/10\\n\\n\r\nPOSTED BY @GameJok3r\\n\\n",

A curious boy finds himself helping out a prisoner of some sort, which could probably get him in a lot of trouble but nonetheless.. curiosity defeats him. If I have to guess, this anime will be about the friendship between this escapee and this curious boy. This anime is probably going to be about conspiracy within no.6 and such. Kinda makes me think of Fractale.",

            "content": "There is a saying about every kick in the butt being a step forward. Taken literally, it sums up for what I felt like while watching the first episode: I've got a kick and I just couldn't stop going forward. It was love at first sight, I know I wouldl enjoy it right from the first 10 seconds.  I really can't praise this anime enough.\r\nFIrst of all I have to say this is no yaoi. And it hardly is a shounen-ai so don't expect romantic moments between the two male characters, despite of what people say. No.6 is a story about contrasts and decadenceof humankind which sometimes goes both ways. The fact that there are a couple of scenes where the two guys seem tender toward each other, from my point of view, was just another way of highlighting the contrasts between them, putting one of them in the dominant (male) side while the other is the weaker (female) side. For a better explanation I could also refer you to the myth of the androgyne, if you really need another explanation regarding male/female sides of one person :))\\n\\n\r\nI love the fact that it starts abruptly, it just kicks you in the middle of everything where you are just left to contemplate everything around you, having dozens of questions in your mind. I've experienced this kind of \"adrenaline beginning\" only in first episode of Gundam SEED (not that they have anything else in common other than thrills... and maybe friendship torn between two worlds). I just have to say it again: the first episode is genius, it perfectly reflects the contrast between the two main characters and by the way the scenery is put together, you get a very close and personal insight to the life of each of them.\\n\\n\r\nSo we have two different characters and two different worlds: Sion and Rat, No.6 and... the outside. If by any means of chance some of you had read George Orwell's \"1984\", you probably have a very good idea about what this No.6 city is: a perfectly controlled and monitored society that suppresses freedom under the cover of a beautiful and safe glass jar. A very hi-tech city, with a community that promotes strict ranking among civilians and assures everyone is given a role in serving and honoring the city. This is supposedly a new postwar organization.\\n\\n\r\nOutside this glass jar, there is the \"real world\", Nezumi's (Rat) world. Again, I don't have enough words to praise the way this real world contrasts with No.6. In the beginning, I was sort of puzzled by the course of some characters here, their behavior seems odd and unnatural. And it is, because the real world has created another set of human values and reference systems that differ a lot from our normal \"moral\" points of view. For example, a dead body isn't too odd of a view but that doesn't mean the streets are filled of some sort of panic. The people learnt not to fear, at the cost of not getting attached to anything and anyone. Without any burdens and caring only for themselves, people became trully free, in contrast with the so dependable population of No.6\\n\\n\r\nI found the graphics, backgrounds and weather effects to have a stunning effect over creating key moments in this anime. Can you imagine actually start feeling cold just by watching the storm in this anime? It simply catches the right feelings. In this matter, I can really relate to Garden of Sinners which also does an incredible job about creating atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nThe character have a few of very very intelligent moments that highlight human nature aspects. The moment Shion opens the window and gets out in the storm in his white socks and screams from the bottom of his lungs along with the storm sirens it's his call for freedom. This kind of scenes make the characters look more human and less like dry creations of an uninspired writer.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough not all the questions might find an answer along the 11 episodes, overall this was  one of if not the most impressive things i've watched, without being a tear jerking production and without having too obviously forced psychological of philosophical references.",

It's really disappointing that they let such an idea slip away and make it into a shonen-ai anime.",

            "content": "a series full of excitement and entertainment that could satisfy every viewer by the end is probably not existing in the anime community. even if there is such a show it shouldn't be able to get appreciated by everyone. however, there are some series like NO\u00b06. the kind of show that could pick the interest of many people, and holds many satisfying aspects in different extents. witnessing the absolute conclusion of this exciting story is one of these aspects.\r\neverything sets off with the protagonist and his childhood friends. both of them have a very high IQ and considered among the top tier students of thesociety. the beginning of the story gives a misleading grasp of the incoming events since all we can see are two kids living in a perfect city that seems to be  technology-advanced. but soon enough the entry of the next main character occurred suddenly, at that moment we will witness the birth of the uncommon friendship of shion the genius child and nezumi the fugitive who's running away from the police after escaping prison. and that will last until the very end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nwhile the two MC's age is similar, around 12 years old, one would definitely wonder if the plot progression will continue with them this way. especially after giving the OP and ED a look we can see the two of them not only looking more mature but also Shion's appearance is completely different, to the point one can doubt if he is really the same person. this will absolutely lead to bewilderment, and thus asking some basic question while seeking for a fitting answer revealing the truth. probably a major event took place resulting in this abrupt change of character design. so did something really happened? fear not, you will not be disappointed simply because right after the first episode the intensity of the events will gradually increase as it will take place outside the flawless city. in the reality.\\n\\n\r\nfeaturing the humanity's future in a dystopia as a basic setting for the story is not adapted very much in nowadays's anime, yet it is not that scarce either. until the day, i can name at least 5 shows that apply the same kind of future setting, and for some reason whenever i write about them i can't help but wonder the same thing. is mankind's fate really that desperate? literally every single one of them has the same idea about humanity meeting its near end (either as a result of an apocalypse, a world war, human's decline...) maybe because it's more intriguing that way.\\n\\n\r\nthe same thing applies to the idea of the ostensibly flawless society hiding deeper dark secrets in it's innermost. however, this kind of situation is always welcome for expressing, after all, it ironically applies in some of our societies, of course in a less revealing way. exhibiting the irregular wasp sickness that seems supernatural no matter how you look at it at the beginning of the story was also a good choice. despite how unbelievable it may seem, the audience has enough time to adapt to it and consider it as a natural plot material. unfortunately, even if NO\u00b06 holds a valuable substance full of bright potentials to give prominence and depth to the cruelness of the dystopian society system in order to maintain order, it completely fails at accomplishing its goal inherently because of the sudden fast pacing and the addition of some half-baked major element at a later point.\\n\\n\r\nshion and nezumi's erratic friendship was quite a surprise to say the least. it slowly goes beyond the typical friendship as they spend more time together until at one point it becomes obvious that it's more than that. with the goodnight kiss, things started to get confusing and making sense at the same time. yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's shounen-ai. personally, i find shounen-ai and yaoi to be disgusting nor can i stand watching that kind of romance. yet, this time for some reason. i didn't mind it. actually, i found it to be beautiful. NO\u00b06 makes you realize that love springing between two guys is not something to be ashamed of. the emotional light kiss they had at the end made me slightly change my mind about this matter. the show doesn't center it's whole attention at this kind of scenes, so people who still insist against it could always turn a blind eye to these rare scenes.\\n\\n\r\nin spite of their actual relation, the two MCs were raised in complete opposite conditions. Shion lived in the NO\u00b06 city, winning various prizes and studying in a school for intelligent students with Safu his childhood friend. one day his life changed after covering nezumi from the police. as a result, he was fired from the noble ward and sent with his mother to the lost city wich is still not a bad place to live in. there he carried on living a normal life for the next four years while nezumi spent it outside the city. Safu and Shion's mother played an important role in the development of the story since they were representing the inside of the society as a whole. it applies on the dogloan and the women-dealer too, although they're only supporting characters, they did there supporting just fine.\\n\\n\r\nwith this difference in the environment and culture comes the most interesting part. when Shion will be forced to live outside the city due to some certain turns of event, his annoying idealism will gradually fall apart as he will discover the shocking truth behind his beloved society. at the same time, Nezumi who developed hate for it while running away from his cruel past tries to convince him of the realistic situation he's experiencing and place him in the right lane. thus, many arguments raise between them very often. that is until Shion's tolerance reaches its summit, and his kind and sympathetic character will make a complete 180-degree twist into a yandere mode. it is for you to discover what will happen then.\\n\\n\r\nthe inconvenient fast pacing in the end and unreasonable plot twist around the last few episodes was an act that shouldn't be taken by NO\u00b06. honestly, it feels like storyboard writers were immersed into making the story and didn't recall that this is just a one core show consisting of 11 episodes until the 10th one. everything gets warped up in a tremendous speed leaving lots of mysteries behind. needless to mention the addition of the half-baked magic elements in episode 8 as an attempt to cover for its plot holes and wich feels, unlike ergo proxy (the show that NO\u00b06 tries hard to be like and fails to due to various reasons) feels illogical no matter how you look at it. wasn't all of this about science? oh well, it is what it is, i still find the execution of events existing so let's stop complaining.\\n\\n\r\nas for the visuals, the most prominent aspect is the contrast of the color saturation between the neat city and its outside. it's something that needs to be referred to. the dilapidated town presented only by fading colors is nowhere to be compared to the blue sky and captivation green lands inside the city. also, the pretty character design of both the two MCs was well done. white haired characters with red eyes are always welcome. a good job was done in regard to giving in-depth details to the backgrounds, that way they could perfectly fit with the theme of the story. NO\u00b06 seems to have something to do with sunsets and sundowns as it makes use of them whenever it's possible to bring on the romantic mood between our two \"friends\". and succeed in doing so.\\n\\n\r\nthe OSTs were fine, to the extent of average. i can praise it for not ruining the intensity of the events. however nezumi's songs, for me are an indispensable element in the story. including how well of a fine job the voice actor did in regards to Nezumi's character, his singing was also magnificent, it makes me wonder how could a mainly voice like that be able to perform such a good song. forgetting the ending song's performance by Aimer is not an option either, melding her charming voice along with an emotional melody, lyrics and slideshow of Shion and Nezumi assisted in the rise of a genuinely alluring piece i was emotionally related to.\\n\\n\r\nin the end, how is NO\u00b06 execution of events is done? it was pretty bad indeed, however, that doesn't cut down the entertainment and excitement you get while watching. enjoying a story set in a future dystopia and witnessing its complete conclusion would leave most of the audience satisfied with it, and this applies essentially to me. so in short if NO\u00b06 is not for those who can't stand but feel anxious about plot holes nor for those who are against BL. anybody who's fine with this two condition should find the show enjoyable enough.",
