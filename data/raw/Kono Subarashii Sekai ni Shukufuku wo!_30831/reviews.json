            "content": "WELCOME TO KONOSUBA'S RIFT\r\nThis review will be rigged with League of Legends references. If you don't get it, you obviously need to start playing the game right now. And no there's no spoiler.\r\nKonosuba > DotA 2 *Grabs boobs*.\r\nAt a quick glance, Konosuba might be as average as any other RPG harem where the MC is Faker playing against a bunch of Crowns and Kuros, where all he has to do is perform a barrel roll on stage then proceed to win Worlds. Three times. \r\nWRONG. It's far from that yet it was so good that I would consider this anime to be THE anime ofthe season. How? (MF support duh)\\n\\n\r\nAfter 10 episodes directed by Mr. Michael Bay, our party of Bronze V garbage feeders still hasn't managed to get out of the ghetto ass town made for noobs and losers, let alone destroying the enemy Nexus. Basically, the plot moved SLOWER THAN THE FUCKING CLOCK WHEN I'M AT WORK. At the very least, they did manage to slay a super fed Mordekaiser (but he did nothing wrong ;_;), farm that clueless Tahm Kench over and over and survive a debacle of One-for-all Renekton gank.\\n\\n\r\n30 SECONDS UNTIL MAIN CHARACTERS SPAWN\\n\\n\r\nThe art was bright and colorful, reflecting the overall mellow mood. the background and water art were especially beautiful that they gave me eyegasm. The skin, textures and animation is fairly good, but at times they were sloppy like a bunch of chimpanzees were substituted in to take charge of production.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks and OP/ED songs were okay, fairly relaxing, mellow which captured the overall silly and light-hearted nature of the series but not that impressive (to me at least). It would've been better if the troll music from Random LoL Moments on Youtube were used. On the other hand, the voice acting was superb which greatly contributed to the comedy and overall enjoyment of the series. Kazuma's \"Hai, Kazuma desu\", Aqua's cries and rants were so hilarious I can't even.\\n\\n\r\nWhat made Konosuba highly enjoyable was the team of 5 totally dysfunctional, insufferable trash players and the comedy that resulted from their inability to cooperate, which led to their flaming one another and getting utterly raped by whatever's going on around them. Konosuba makes fun of the RPG genre and its cliches in general instead of following them, leaving a stronger impression on me, the viewer who's obviously tired of SAO, Log Horizons and such. Furthermore, no anime would be complete without this most fundamental rule: Cute girls. Konosuba's cast of girls (and Kazuma) were cute, yes, they're even highly distinctive and did not fall into apparent tropes that are so overused nowadays, making them relatively fresh.\\n\\n\r\n\"Baa.......kaaaa Ta...taaa......taric-kun, it's not like I wanted to go bot lane with you or anything... Don't misunderstand\" - Tsundere Ezreal.\\n\\n\r\n\"I'm sorry Lux-chan, I, Taric, Ezreal-tan's eternal lover will be the only one allowed to go bot lane with him\" *Swings hammer* - *Rainbow splatters* - Yandere Taric\\n\\n\r\nNo, no, we don't need any of that, get outta here.\\n\\n\r\nMAIN CHARACTERS HAVE SPAWNED\\n\\n\r\n- The adc: Satou Kazuma, leader, our hella weak dickwad of an adc compared to Jesus-kun of the RPG world Kirito, but he's got the brain and he actually fights smart despite his auto-flaming. His cynical and realist attitude separated him from our usual never-give-up nakama-powered MCs, which might as well make him the best MC of the season. He's the only adc to not dive into the middle of the enemy team, as rare as it sounds. He's surrounded by idiots and the way he deals with them is uber hilarious, reminds me of how I deal with my own League party. You did not realize that the adc is a melee, and you're not going to question it. Move on\\n\\n\r\nFIRST BLOOD\\n\\n\r\n- The Mid Laner, One Explosion Girl a.k.a Michael Bay's waifu: She's basically Ziggs but with only the Ult, thus she's literally useless after using it, requiring someone to carry her (literally and figuratively) else she'll feed the enemy team's Tahm Kench and Mordekaiser. She is, of course, flamed by Kazuma throughout the series. She's cute, yeah, but she's not like your average moeblob. She's got explosive personalities, explosive ambitions and explosive love for explosions. Hue\\n\\n\r\nENEMY DOUBLE KILL\\n\\n\r\n- The Top Laner, a.k.a MasoLeona: What's better than a tank? A MASOCHISTIC TANK!!!!!!! She's tankier than Rammus, Malphite, and Alistar w/ full tank build combined but her aim is worse than mine in the morning trying to piss while blinded by the Satan God Teemo (he's the real Demon King they have to kill). Needlessly to say, she joyously took all the aggro and flaming like a real M. Scenes where she verbally \"abused\" the honorable Dullahan were priceless. Poor Dully. If only she could aim her E properly... Who even plays Leona top nowadays? This is like fucking Dyrus trolling every game when he's streaming after having retired from TSM.\\n\\n\r\nENEMY TRIPLE KILL\\n\\n\r\n- The Support, Best Girl (sorry Michael Bay fans): Basically your toxic feeder Nami with legs building ap instead of support items while going around trash talking to people and fucking shit up with wataah. She's super derp, always trying to ragequit, feeds Tahm Kench furiously and is constantly flamed by Kazuma but that's where the fun comes from. She just needs a hug and I wanna give her a big hug so badly because she was forced to play support by Kazuma, it's not her fault guys!!!\\n\\n\r\nENEMY QUADRA KILL\\n\\n\r\n- The Jungler, Wizzlestick (because ap jungler w/ drain, but then again it's a contradiction because she is... well... thick, while Fiddlestick is... well... a stick): The one who is super fed but only came to gank like twice during the entire anime but who cares? She's kind and cute af, and she destroys the enemy when it matters most. Unfortunately the support absolutely hates her guts because she's not playing a meta champ, but this is the only time when not everyone blamed the jungler for their misery. If only she ganked lane more often, she'd be a best girl contender. Let's be honest that she's only here because I don't want to have a team of 4 when implementing League of Legends in my review.\\n\\n\r\nENEMY PENTAKILL\\n\\n\r\nEveryone is 1/10 fed and 9/10 feeder, however due to the circumstances they have to stick together because 4 is always better than 1 (5 if the Jungler actually showed up). This is where Konosuba is most different and in a good way, the characters slowly get stronger, better at teamwork, more sympathetic and understanding of one another over, (still weak in the end), not shitting out powers and eternal bonds of friendship all of a sudden. Nobody gets ult from Level 1 guys...\\n\\n\r\nOUR TURRET HAS BEEN DESTROYED\\n\\n\r\nI could relate to Kazuma so well, being a decent League player who prefers to stick to a group of average feeders and make them better, rather than joining a bunch of diamonds because then victory doesn't feels like a true accomplishment, and there's no fun curb-stomping the enemy team all the time. Believe me, I raged hard the night I wrote this review because we played like retards lol.\\n\\n\r\nOUR INHIBITOR HAS BEEN DESTROYED\\n\\n\r\nAfter successfully defending the base from Super Siege Minion spawned by Warlord's Banner of Command, our gang must head into the counteroffensive to be brought by season 2. But until then, let's just say that season 1 was exhilarating to watch. I especially appreciated the silly comedy, the anti-harem and anti-OP MC themes from the series.\\n\\n\r\nMichael Bay would be so proud of Megumin and Konosuba, someone needs to show him this series please.\\n\\n\r\nDEFEAT.... barely avoided.",

            "content": "Konosuba is an anime that I initially thought was going to be great. I mean, it had awesome character design, and it was funny! Well... as you can probably see by the score, my opinion changed pretty quickly. In my opinion, at least 90% of comedy anime are destined for failure, because not everyone is going to find them funny. This one is no exception.\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\r\nSTORY: 2/10\r\nI'm pretty sure everybody has said this already, but, it really is true. After the extreme success of Sword Art Online the reality to game genre has become an insanely overused trope. Konosuba does have one thing going for itthough... Instead of choosing to become ridiculously powerful like almost every other protagonist, this protagonist decides to take the wish granter with him to the 'subarashi sekai'. I can tell you, I wasn't expecting that!\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nART: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art itself in Konosuba... is bad. Really bad. As in, it looks way too old for 2016 quality. It could have been worse, MUCH worse, but it is by no means impressive. What is impressive however, is the animation, especially in episode 10, with all those explosion scenes. Radiant colors flaring everywhere, shapes of all different sizes, but most importantly, in the episodes with the succibi and in the mansion..... HOLY CRAP DID YOU SEE THOSE JIGGLE PHYSICS?!\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nSOUND: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nUgh... well, here goes. Konosuba's sound factor. The opening theme is very catchy. But not the kind of way that makes you want to sing it all the time, the kind that makes you regret ever haring it because you can't stop singing it. The ending theme as well, is just plain and not something anyone will remember. I did like how some characters got themes to match their personalities, but even then the music was mediocre at best. The voice acting is done decently, but is nothing special. The sound effects were also average.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm actually scared to be writing this right now, because the amount of butthurt fanboys is going to be insane. But, here goes... I'll start off with character design. Unrecognizable. Every. Single. One of 'em. They have the traditional 'fantasy world' clothing and design, through and through. As for their personalities: Kazuma is a funny lead that tries to defy the harem cliches. Aqua is funny as well, and memorable for sure, but she is outshined by Darkness, a masochist. Yep. You heard me. A masochist. Hilarious! And of couuuurse, how could I forget fan favorite Megumin! Super cute and always unleashing explosions, what is NOT to love about these characters?!....... They aren't funny anymore. Usually unique characters being fit into a 10 episode anime like this are praised and loved by all, because there isn't enough time to realize the flaws in the character. (I'm guilty of this also). That's not the case with Konosuba. I think it was around episode 7 when I stopped laughing because I had heard the same jokes over and over again. By episode 10, they were straight up annoying.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nOVERALL: 3.75/10\\n\\n\r\nKonosuba... ok, I'm not even going to say it had potential, because it didn't. It was doomed to fail from the start. If you consider this anime funny it is definitely something to try, but if not, don't bother. I would only recommend it to extreme fans of the reality to game genre, and.... well... that's it. If you enjoy it, good for you! As for me, Konosuba was not my cup of tea.",

            "content": "(6.5/10) - If you are curious about the point system I use to grade shows, check my profile for more information. \r\n______________________________________________________________\r\nKonosuba is most likely the last anime i'll be watching this summer. In a way, that makes me happy. Its a very light-hearted and breezy show that I honestly don't want to critique too heavily. At its core, its just so likable and easy to watch. However, I wouldn't be a hardass if I didn't tear up a likable show like this every so often, so lets get into it. \r\nMuch like this show, i'll keep this review breezy and to-the-point. But not beforeI explain the concept of comedy. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe very base idea of a joke is something that makes someone laugh. Something told through a story with a funny punchline that subverts expectations and causes a response of happiness. Put simply, this is exactly what a joke should be. \\n\\n\r\nJokes and comedy in general live on unexpectedness. Something called \"subversion.\" If you think back to any funny joke, the punchline is always there to subvert some sort of expectation. Whether its making something dirtier than you originally thought, or stupider, or more random, or darker, everything in humor is there to be unexpected at its core.\\n\\n\r\nI won't delve into ironic humor which is obviously become so big recently. But that's it. To prove my point I typed in \"Funny jokes\" on google and the first website I went on was titled Jokes.cc.com. \\n\\n\r\nI clicked the first tab I saw and the first joke I saw and what I read the following : \\n\\n\r\nA grasshopper walks into a bar, and the bartender says, \"Hey, we have a drink named after you!\"\\n\r\nThe grasshopper looks surprised and asks, \"You have a drink named Steve?\"\\n\\n\r\nIs it a good joke? Well, maybe not. Its a very overdone joke at this point, but it follows every format that a joke does. It had a setup, a delivery, a punchline, and a subversion of expectations with that punchline. You expect a grasshopper not to have a name but man, his name is STEVE! Fucking hilarious! Or, at least it was at some point. \\n\\n\r\nSo the more we see a similar setup and delivery, the more unfunny a joke becomes. The less you get surprised when the punchline has an animal saying his name is \"Steve\". That subversion element is gone and the joke is no longer funny. It becomes a cliche.\\n\\n\r\nBut still, I see so much television out there that strives on comedic cliches in bad and good ways. In a bad way, there is television out there just checking off a checklist of \"cliche humor that is sure to make someone laugh\", and then in a good way, there are shows out there that use cliche humor AS the setup to a more clever or ironic punchline. \\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind, i'll get into Konosuba. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[PART 1] : The theme\\n\\n\r\nThis is a fun little show. I won't waste your time by giving you a plot synopsis, but at its core its a show about a dysfunctional group of people trying to live in a fantasy world. I automatically recommend it for two kinds of people. Avid MMO players as well as just fans of anime. \\n\\n\r\nIts at its funniest when it does clever (and occasionally not-so-clever) nods to the idea of being a show about a party in an MMO. \\n\\n\r\nA tank who's a horndoggo masochist. \\n\\n\r\nA healer who's a weakling and a coward. \\n\\n\r\nA glass-cannon DPS who's out of mana after one spell. \\n\\n\r\nThe party-leader who's useless in combat. \\n\\n\r\nIts a funny concept in itself and it lends well to subvert a lot of expectations that anime has. Especially with the boom of MMO anime like Sword Art Online, RE:Zero, etc. Its always nice to see the piss being taken out of a really popular cliche. \\n\\n\r\nI just wish Konosuba actually did that more. I felt like this concept was often a bit too hidden or even underutilized. A lot of scenes were simply cliche and not a funny twist on the cliche. Mind you, I don't find pointing out that this a cliche and still doing it with a straight face is any different that just doing the cliche and moving on. If anything, it drags it out. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is occasionally self-aware and occasionally not. That's what makes the tonal shifts in a few episodes so jarring. We have a lot of self-awareness in the final episode of the season and then literally none in the episode before. This makes the author of the Light Novel feel as though he's cherry picking the things he wants to make fun of. If anything, the reason this show falls a little short in execution is because the author isn't willing to to go \"whole hog\" with the concept. \\n\\n\r\nIts like he's laughing at one thing because he thinks its stupid and then doing another, equally dumb, cliche with a straight face. It comes off as though he's not creative enough to think of something else in place of that cliche. Or if anything, do it with the same self-awareness. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[PART 2] : Art \\n\\n\\n\r\nAfter I finished the show I read a little about the response it got. The show received a mostly positive response, however, I see a lot of people criticizing its art. Personally, I didn't find it any worse than a lot of anime I've seen. In fact, it did a few things better. \\n\\n\r\nI'll gladly take simpler designs with enhanced animation over complex designs over literally just still images (looking at you ever Shounen-action show ever). \\n\\n\r\nSo this shows actual animation was fairly solid throughout. It was unclean, sure, but honestly that kind of added to the charm of the whole thing. I liked that these characters didn't feel like a perfect-looking flawed bunch. They are a flawed-looking flawed-bunch, which fits.\\n\\n\r\nWhether this was done on purpose or not doesn't matter to me. I'm going to give Studio Deen the benefit of the doubt here. Where this show is also a bit hit-or-miss with is the character designs.\\n\\n\r\nWe get a generic looking protagonist with Kazuma, who gets elevated by VA Jun Fukushima's voice work, which is often times deadpan and the highlight of the show, comedy wise. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters are also fairly uninspired looking. From the goddess, Aqua, and her \"seen her before\" look of \"anime goddess\". To a few of the locals having the whole \"same-face\" treatment. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the show stands out with its design of Darkness, the crusader tank of the group who's armor looks pretty great. As well as the adorable Loli mage Megumin who quickly skyrocketed to my favorite character in the entire show. Her design is the shows most unique (and cute) as well as a pretty nice performance by her VA, Rie Takahashi, who from the looks of it is newer to voice acting than the others in the show. \\n\\n\r\nSo the design is a mixed bag that's elevated by the entire style of the show. I'm also a complete sucker for fantasy, as its my favorite genre. So everything from the quaint starting town to the grass-swept hills are things that I look at extremely fondly. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[PART 3] : Sound\\n\\n\\n\r\nI'll keep it short. The sound design in the show is OK. It seems to be using the same effects as most other shows in similar environments use. This is fine, to be honest. I'm not expecting some crazy level of detail in the sound design. Apart from the cool popping noises we get from Megumin's magic, and the magic itself looking pretty cool, its generally run-of-the-mill.\\n\\n\r\nThe intro song is also fairly forgettable, to be honest. There's really nothing about it that's memorable and it plays as every other Shounen opening does. Its loud, poppy, and features scenes of the characters looking at the camera or at each other. \\n\\n\r\nWhere this show REALLY excels in sound is the credits song, which is fucking. AMAZING. It might actually be my favorite song I've heard an anime produce, ever. Its really really good and I found myself constantly just listening to the entire credits track, which is something I've never done before.\\n\\n\r\nIt honestly perfectly encapsulates the starting zone feel in MMO's. It has this soothing, catchy, and memorable quality about it. It also reincorporates the shows title in it. Its perfect and I wish i heard more of it as I believe that in the second season when they inevitably leave the starting area, the song won't be used. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[PART 4] : Comedy\\n\\n\\n\r\nInevitably, lets talk about comedy. I touched a little on it in the first part, but lets get into it fully. This show is a action-comedy show which means that the comedy is equally, if not the biggest element in the show. Its also the first action-comedy anime I've seen. Even if a lot of the action Shounen that I've seen did have comedy elements. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is very \"anime\" with its comedy. I hope that doesn't sound offensive, but every single anime i've seen approaches comedy in a very similar way. For some reason, and I cannot for the life of me place it, maybe its cultural or something, anime has this necessity of making a joke TOO obvious. It makes the joke right in your face. It suffocates you with it. Every reaction is usually overdone and HUGE. \\n\\n\r\nThis is great for some people, especially people who love unsubtle slapstick. But for someone like me who finds comedy to be the funniest when its subtle, it falls flat more times than one. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough this show does do some funny facial expressions as well as cuts the music for some deadpan delivery, which actually did get a few chuckles from me, it often feels as though its too deep in its \"roots\" to try and create anything subtle about any of its delivery. \\n\\n\r\nThe only actor who really nails it with the concept of \"subtle\" is our protagonists VA. I don't think I've ever called the protagonist of an anime its \"best\" part, but honestly, Kazuma wrung the most laughs from me. He plays the deadpan to the other characters crazy, which makes him a funny foil a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also has a tendency to drag its very obvious setups and jokes on. A panty-stealing scene is forgivable as it helps establish our protagonists knack for the 'steal' spell. But a bathing scene that goes from chuckle-worthy eye-roll-inducing cliche to \"please this is just getting stupid\" is the show cutting it a bit too long. \\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate my point about comedy way above in the start of the review. The writer needs to realize that adept watchers who watch a lot of television pin-point cliches from a mile away. Just because you point out certain cliches doesn't make the cliches you do any more forgivable. If anything, it makes them LESS forgivable. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn a show that's bases is its interactions between characters, i'm also sad to say that these interactions become a bit stale. Especially the relationship between Kazuma and the goddess Aqua, which becomes repetitive by episode five.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully romance is never really introduced into this harem-esq show as that would spoil any amount of fun I was having. It just doesn't need shit like that. Especially since these characters talking is so one-note a lot of the time. \\n\\n\r\nThe only scenes which honestly don't have semi-cliche and repetitive dialogue are the scenes with Kazuma and the best character, Megumin. Their scenes feel more natural and as though they actually have a friendship, instead of darting from \"caring about these people \" to \"hating their guts\", like our protagonist does so often. \\n\\n\r\nThis impacts the shows development. Which a comedy show doesn't necessarily NEED to have, but if it prompts not to have development, it NEEDS to have a solid base of characters. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\nShows like Rick and Morty, Community, Parks and Recreations, The Office, Arrested Development, all have character development and progression. \\n\\n\r\nWhile shows like Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia do not. So how does Always Sunny stay fresh? Well the base characters that we were introduced to had a various amount of personality to them. They came stock with so much personality that the show can ring eleven, ten episode long seasons from them and it still feel fresh. The show is still going onto its twelfth too. \\n\\n\r\nSo where Konosuba should really focus next season is on making sure these characters don't feel as one note. Not every dialogue scene has to end with Aqua and Kazuma yelling at each other. Not every scene has to end with Darkness being awkwardly sexual. Its just not necessary since those parts of the characters are already established.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like the joke about the grasshopper named Steve has become old and overused, these characters interactions became somewhat of a drag midway through this shows VERY short season! \\n\\n\r\nThis is only emphasized by the messy introduction of a lot of background characters that fill up the show. From Kazuma's two friends that get randomly introduced in episode nine to the lich Wiz, who all feel like stories cut from the Light Novel that were still included in the show. \\n\\n\r\nIts more than a bit messy. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion] : \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo I don't find it THAT funny, I find the base concept generic, I think it misses a lot of opportunities to comment on MMO's, it cherry picks too often on what it wants to be meta about... why does this show have a 6.5/10? Which is by all means an above average score!\\n\\n\r\nWell, as I said early in the review, its likable. If I wasn't laughing at certain scenes and jokes, I had a little grin on my face. It was a fun little show to watch and I found myself thankful that it only had ten episodes. These ten episodes were a bit messy, much like the animation and dialogue, but they were endearing if anything. \\n\\n\r\nEverything from the montage in the third episode of Megumin and Kazuma blowing shit up to the way the shows slice-of-life feel is formatted with quests these characters need to complete. \\n\\n\r\nAnd these quests were the shows more entertaining aspects because I know many people including myself have had these experiences with players in an MMO before. The hilarious incompetence is something we look fondly back on. I only wish this show focused more on that. Its most laugh-out-loud moments came from quests as well as the events that came about because of those quests.\\n\\n\r\nMost specifically the entire string between episode two and three, where a quest involving giant frogs leads to some pretty damn funny results. These results are what build this shows undoubtedly large heart. \\n\\n\r\nI think it wrongfully thinks that its heart comes from emotional scenes that it sparingly includes in its run-time. No. Its heart comes from everything but that. Its the working for money. The questing and getting overrun by mobs. The high-level player encounter. Its all what makes MMO so memorable. \\n\\n\r\nI hope the show doesn't lose that feel when the second season airs next year. I hope it keeps that and doesn't instead go into its own more focused story. Have them move around doing higher level quests, gear up, and just work together. From that there could be ample time to develop these characters more.\\n\\n\r\nI get that their point is that their all just a dumb bunch of shlubs, but if they aren't going for an Always Sunny in Philadelphia level of unlikable douchebaggery, then the author shouldn't be hesitant to give them a better relationship with each other. \\n\\n\r\nI give this show a lot of merit because for everything that it does wrong or messily it makes up for in memory and heart. For every joke that falls flat on its ass and every prolonged scene of awkward and not very well done fan-service, the shows more relaxed moments are what kept me watching in the end. \\n\\n\r\nThis brings me back to the end-credit song of the show. That songs perfectly explains the feelings this show occasionally delivered. That's what I want to see more of. Not another scene of Aqua being bitchy or Darkness having giant jiggly tits. Let the comedy come naturally through the flow of events that a lot of people can relate to. \\n\\n\r\nLet the breezy heart of the show take you away into the world.",

            "content": "MAKE WAY FOR THE ACTUAL BEST SHOW OF WINTER 2016!!!\r\nKonoSuba spews out pure joys and rainbows. With other shows telling great stories or exploring philosophy and other themes, Konosuba ignores all that and focuses on pure entertainment! With genuinely hilarious albeit niche comedy, any flaws this series has are just parodied to still become enjoyable. There's very little to criticize about this show, because I'm not even sure whether or not all of these \"flaws\" it has are there on purpose or not.\r\nKonoSuba is the obligatory goofball of its season. It's so over the top, but it manages to execute its quirkiness in a waythat's super hilarious and lighthearted. Instead of pursuing a serious story, it focuses on slice of life shenanigans that make fun of stereotypes, like character tropes and MMO characteristics. KonoSuba is an amazing anime to just sit down and relax to. Other shows getting on your nerves with their turtle or cheetah pacing? Pop an episode of KonoSuba. Feeling down because you just finished an amazing show, and you have fallen into a showhole? KonoSuba will cheer you up with its refreshing comedy, and it will get you back into an anime watching mood in no time! \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Cast of characters are funny and resemble other awesome characters.\\n\r\n- Parody references of MMO mechanics are creative, funny, and now that you think about it, MMOs make no sense at all!\\n\r\n- For a silly series, the animation and art is gorgeous and the soundtrack is awesome too! The ED especially has a Fairy Tail feel.\\n\r\n- Just pure joy comes out of watching this.\\n\r\n- MY CABBAGES!!!!\\n\r\n- The show is so cliche that it's anti-cliche.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- There is very little relevant plot.\\n\r\n- Only 10 episodes. Really? Are you kidding?\\n\r\n- Has promises of going somewhere yet never does.\\n\r\n- Since characters are parodies, they don't have much character of their own and aren't very unique.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nDespite the fact that there is almost no actual story, and that it's more like a slice of life of a stereotypical MMORPG world, the little events that happen are creative and enjoyable, especially to you hardcore MMORPG gamers out there. Konosuba's first episode is actually one of the better first episodes in the medium, as it tells you exactly what you're getting yourself into. The show parodies the mechanics of MMO games to the point of boner inducing laughs, such as highlighting the outrageousness of what MMO skills can do, as well as the randomness and weirdness of MMO events and quests. It also parodies anime by using subtle 4th wall breaks in reaction to what the characters say or do. The show is a parody and the characters know it. Konosuba has this quirk of doing something so stupidly outrageous that you can't even get mad at it. This show is incredibly self aware of its silliness, and as a result, takes it even higher.\\n\\n\r\nKonosuba has this thing it likes to do, and that's bring everything full circle for the laughs. And when I say full circle, I mean literally full circle, as in by the end of all the outrageous things happening, the story hasn't progressed a single step. Even so, there is a sense of a growing bond, perhaps an unhealthy bond but a bond for sure, between the characters, and this is definitely something that progresses throughout the series. Unfortunately, this developing bond leaves the story in the dust. Konosuba is like parkour: it takes the most insane and outrageous route to get to where it wants to go, except it doesn't go anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nEven silly anime have high budget art and animation, and KonoSuba is proof of that. The animation is actually really gorgeous (for example, the animation of the DNA strands are actually pretty cool!) The characters look like shit but for all the right reasons, Aqua's design highlights her adorableness and cynical nature. The other characters also have fitting designs for their characteristics, and have some little resemblances to other characters that they could possibly be based off of. However, this is Deen we are talking about, so it never keeps this quality of animation, and it lowers in quality constantly. KonoSuba is one of those shows that actually benefits from its shitty art at times, and the really poorly drawn faces make me laugh that much harder. In fact, I was under the impression that Deen was making fun of their own shitty animation with this series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe OP is catchy and the ED is amazing. The OST is pretty good, but the main highlight is the Voice Acting. The seiyuus match their characters amazingly, each line being executed with passion and energy. I wouldn't know for sure, but it sounded like the seiyuus were having a blast. The execution of the punch lines hit home every time. This show is a very loud show, characters are constantly screaming at each other and laughing in distorted ways, and I'm sure it's tough for the seiyuus' voices. When it comes to comedy, the jokes are only as funny as how funny it is told, and in this case, it was told well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nThis cast is so outrageous, they essentially make the show. Each character parodies a stereotype, and they do it very well. The MC, Kazuma, is the smart but talentless trope who is the only sane one around, and whenever his mindset matches the viewer, which happened a decent amount with me, it made the situations comedy gold. Aqua parodies the dumb but full of potential clumsy character, Megumin is the chuunibyou trope (except not really cause her powers are real) and has a lot of confidence. And of course, Darkness is the obligatory perverted masochist! They take their tropes as far as they can go, and it makes this show that much funnier.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, gimmicks like these can only go so far. The real value behind these characters are their interactions. These days, character interactions are the base of comedy anime and if the interactions seem unnatural or forced, the jokes can only be so funny. In Konosuba, not only are the interactions very natural and flow well, but they are so god damn unpredictable. Despite the apparently clear cut tropes these characters follow, the interactions end up being stuff you wouldn't expect. Timing and predictability play as important of a role as the quality of the joke itself, and the cast of Konosuba goes out of their way to execute jokes perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis show is incredibly refreshing and, most importantly, holds a lot of rewatch value! It's a good example of a show that is good and feels good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nThis show is so fun to watch. If you want a show were you don't have to think about anything and you can just sit and enjoy whatever is thrown at you, this show's gotchu! Of course, many watch anime expecting a plot that actually goes somewhere, and Konosuba is definitely not going anywhere, but I implore that you at least give it a shot.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Take out all the flaws of SAO and replace it with comedy, and you get this show!\\n\\n\r\nHERE IS TO A GLORIOUS AND OUTRAGEOUS SEASON 2!!!\\n",

            "content": "The influx of MMO themed anime in the recent years may have viewers disheartened by the fact that mostly those share very similar premises and are executed for the most part in similar ways without any significant difference. Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!, or Konosuba in short, is yet another such anime, yet with an interesting twist: it actually takes a comedic stance on its themes, as well as characters, which is great to see in the sea of MMO-type of anime. In fact, it could be seen as a parody of the genre. However, as enjoyable as the anime was, it suffers fromvarious issues, the main one being its aimless demeanor after reaching its peak in the first half.\\n\\n\r\n~Story~\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Konosuba is focused around Kazuma Satou who just casually dies on the most average day of his life, and in the most unheroic way at that. When he reawakens in the afterlife, he is given the choice to either go to heaven or defeat the Demon King, and goes for the latter - not after he appoints the arrogant Godess Aqua to join him in his journey. With both personalities being quite different, the one being pessimistic, while the other arrogant, hilarity ensures. This is further backed by the comedic approach on its themes and story, which for some may be hit or miss.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of defeating a demon lord has been explored an innumerable amount of times, yet this anime manages to incorporate genuine hilarious elements such as parodies directly to some MMORPG game mechanics (useless skills, grinding, you name it) or the several anime troupes within the genre itself. It is actually hilarious to see. A thing that stands out in the anime is the sense of authenticity of the character's progression: by repeating several actions that represent the \"grind\" in a game, these convey to audiences a continuous, yet wide-spanning timeline, in which the characters relationships develop, besides of displaying the little details of the world they live in. Concerning the pacing of this work, it is well executed, keeping viewers for most of its duration interested by not prolonging any scene or event longer than necessary, which mostly applies to the flow events as well. Characters are introduced through the various mechanics of the world in a satisfying manner, which is an added bonus.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as positive as it may sound, the anime sadly suffers from progression issues after the first half. The first five episodes are dedicated to a introducing the main characters and their hardships, as well as introducing the various secondary characters; with of course hilarious scenes and jokes. Furthermore, progression was made to reach their ultimate goal, the defeat of the Demon King, which kept the story interesting. However, the anime settles itself with little to no progression on the last part, in addition to jokes getting old, and at times just lacking. This is further noticeable with various characters that are abruptly introduced and then left forgotten, with a heavy increase in fanservice in an episode that kind of broke with the immersion of this piece. Naturally, the short duration of the series may have had an impact on the aforementioned problems.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nComedy can never be as good without its characters: Konosuba did actually a great job on this department, albeit admittingly being a bit shallow at times. The different personalities of the cast further enhanced the comedic aspect of the series, which could have gone wrong when treated wrongly. Character development is nihil in this show, but was easily forgiven as it was not its focus. The interactions between the cast are well executed, despite their opposing personalities: this is tackled by the situation they find themselves in, in which they are forced together due to their circumstances. In fact, they're for most part actually just plain dumb or average. Some supporting characters are introduced, but for the most part felt rather lacking, as these were either introduced and forgotten, or the main characters came in contact with them, but that happened off-screen.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist Kazuma is where the show is centered about, and quite honestly, the driving force behind the whole show. His cynical and pessimistic personality on life really adds to the overall enjoyment of the series, as he is quite the opposite of your typical protagonist: furthermore, it is quite hilarious to see his interactions with his peers. Then there is Aqua that, despite being a Goddess, is quite arrogant and self-absorbed, it is quickly apparent she is quite the useless person, further mocking the \"goddess\" title. Some character development could be appreciated due to various events, yet was sufficient to feel authentic. Other characters of importance are Megumin, the archmage chuunibyou with am obsession about demon magic, or the masochistic crusader Darkness, who admittingly got a bit annoying by the end of the show. \\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality of Konosuba was as a whole average, yet certainly sufficient without breaking immersion in the story. What must be mentioned are the animations on the boobs of the female cast: these varied immensely, going from either saggy to upright. This might have been on purpose, yet why is unclear. As for the art style, it was at first glance rather lacking, yet as the anime progressed, it became apparent that this particular art style worked in its favour: especially when the facial expression are concerned. This matched magnificently with the various situations, personalities and atmosphere it was trying to convey.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Konosuba complemented with the comedic nature of the anime, although being either generic, or just forgettable. The opening and ending themes matched as well, yet, once again, were average. However, the selection of voice actors for the different characters were certainly very well done, matching with the different tones and personalities of the cast.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nOverall Konosuba was a title that came as a very pleasant surprise this season: in fact, I wouldn't have started it were it not for the recommendation of a user. The anime uses a template that has been recycled greatly, yet does it with a parodying stance on the MMO genre: this was further enhanced by its cast of character and voice actors. Despite all of this, it sadly suffered from an aimless demeanor in its last half, which was disappointing, albeit having some amusing moments. Regardless of said issues, I can't deny I enjoyed it, and I will be awaiting for the second season of Konosuba that has been announced. I truly hope it expands on its premise and progresses on it in the second season. This is a type of anime that can be either hilarious to some, or just plain bad for others, so depending on what you have read, it may be something for you.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "Ah Konosuba! \r\nI have a confession to make. When watching a show of the fantasy genre, I\u2019d often try to picture myself as the protagonist. In this series, it\u2019s almost impossible for me to do with a guy like Kazuma. Why? Because he\u2019s stuck with three characters who are all troublesome in their own ways and that\u2019s something I\u2019d find a hard time dealing with. Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo (also known as Konosuba!) is a show based on the light novel that\u2019s a bit unusual for a fantasy story.\r\nOn paper, the show feels like the generic type of stuff we see based onlight novel adaptations. Kazuma is a hikikomori and he ends up dead after trying to save a girl. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve probably heard of this a million times before. Soon, he encounters Aqua, a goddess and is given a chance to be reincarnated in his current body with memories and apparently mission to defeat the Demon King. The first episode quickly establishes the essence of the story and it\u2019s pretty straightforward. That is..until you realize the show is seemingly a parody of itself. \\n\\n\r\nEvery episode, there are segments when the characters are self-aware about their surroundings. If you don\u2019t believe me, just ask Kazuma. As a guy with a vast knowledge about otaku culture, there\u2019s no question that the show often makes fun of him. The interactions and relationships he forges with others is also mostly comedic. Kazuma and Aqua\u2019s relationship stands out as the idiot duo. It\u2019s pretty easy to see that they aren\u2019t very compatible especially with Kazuma\u2019s self-interests. In essence, he isn\u2019t a hero that fights for others but mostly for himself. In the meantime, Aqua is often useless with her skills and low intelligence despite having the status of a Goddess. Often or not, the two shares a relationship that stands along the firm line of \u201ctwo people basically forced to cooperate with each other\u201d. It doesn\u2019t stop there though. Megumin, a mage with chunnibyou-like personality and Darkness, a masochist knight also joins them on the quest. Together, they make up the Adventurer\u2019s Guild.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who are familiar with Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai, Megumin will probably feel similar to the character, Rika. Her over exaggerated speeches and chuunibyou behavior are the highlights of her character. And adding to her arsenal of tricks, she\u2019s got explosive magic which apparently has a limit before she collapses in comedic fashion. Then, there\u2019s Darkness. She\u2019s both an honorable knight and masochist. Yeah, you heard that right. For some peculiar reason, the show also makes her look like a jobber as she often misses her attacks in comedic fashion. When examining these two characters, it\u2019s easy to say that the party is doomed to fail. How are they supposed to defeat the Demon King with this pool of talent? The answer might be Kazuma but his thieving skills doesn\u2019t help much either except for stripping others of their panties. Nonetheless, the show makes it clear that the quest isn\u2019t meant to be taken seriously. Each episode divides segments in their fantasy world and show what Kazuma\u2019s party is capable of. Unfortunately for them, it often ends up with disastrous moments like being swallowed by oversized toads, being assaulted by armies of cabbages, trapped by alligators, etc. You get the general idea. In retrospect, the show is self-aware of its intentions and almost makes us pity the protagonists for their pathetic worthiness.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, that\u2019s what actually makes the series stand out as enjoyable. It\u2019s fun with all the comedic factors with Darkness\u2019 machoism or Aqua being useless during their adventure. Kazuma\u2019s character is more of a deconstruction of the hero trope and his death is even portrayed as a parody. And while it seems like he may have a \u201charem\u201d, there\u2019s actually a lot more emphasis on Kazuma trying to escape from the trio. However, there\u2019s development in their connection as well. While the girls sees him as a useless leader of the group, they do trust him more and more throughout the show. Similarly, Kazuma does begin rely on his party more as times goes on. However, their quest results are often pretty predictable where they manage to defeat the boss, but not without getting a lot of humiliation in between.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, this show will probably be a hit or miss for the audience. It will really depend on how you take in the humor as the show sells its comedy. At times, it\u2019s genuinely funny while other times may feel like it\u2019s forced down our throats. However, I\u2019d say that the show handled its comedy aspects right. The protagonists may feel irritating to watch but also very entertaining because of how much they fail. It\u2019s subverted to the point where we have to wonder if they are legitimate adventurers. As a fantasy-adventure show, it\u2019s also interesting to see how far it extends its concepts. It follows a lot of standards like game currency, completing quests, guilds, and fighting bosses. Just don\u2019t take the show seriously because of the quests themselves are more of a joke than anything else. It\u2019s still a legitimate fantasy series but unlike some fantasy shows such as Hai to Grimgar, it\u2019s all about more having fun rather than surviving.\\n\r\nOn the lesser fun note, the artwork is a really downside produced by studio DEEN. The previews weren\u2019t impressive so I had low expectations from the start. After watching the series, my mind didn\u2019t change much in terms of technical visuals. The characters look like they are cut from a potato with minimal effort. There\u2019s not much details poured into the characters besides the character designs (minus Kazuma as he always looks dull). Backgrounds looks moderate although convincing for the fantasy setting while the action is more or less exciting. Oh and of course, there\u2019s some fan service. From suggestive camera angles to masochism, it\u2019s there.\\n\\n\r\nWhen examining the soundtrack, it\u2019s actually fairly well done. While the OP and ED theme songs aren\u2019t spectacular, it\u2019s constructed with a clear amount of fantasy details and highlights of the main protagonists. The show also retains a lighthearted OST soundtrack because the series really isn\u2019t meant to be taken seriously. And finally, I have to give some praise to the main characters\u2019 voice acting. All of the characters are fun to watch by voice talent as they are able to sell their comedic expressions. From character interactions to fighting against bosses, it\u2019s quite entertaining to see how they react during near-death moments. Oh and who can forget about Darkness\u2019 masochistic behavior?\\n\\n\r\nThis show is actually surprising. That is, it\u2019s surprising at how the idea of \u2018being trapped in a fantasy world\u2019 can be so much fun. From the endless parodies, self-awareness, and character expressions, it\u2019s easy to say that Konosuba is more than just about completing quests. This is probably going to be a deciding factor for most viewers as the comedy will not appeal to everyone. It sometimes can feel too forced or repetitive. Also, it doesn\u2019t help with the minimal amount of characterization as the show itself makes fun of its character cast. The art department also seems to put poor effort into constructing the series as a whole. However, I\u2019d still advise giving Konosuba a try. It took me a little time to get used to the comedy as well but in the end, there\u2019s more to it than meets the eye.\\n\\n\r\nOh and Season 2 was announced today. Here we go again (soon)!\\n",

No. Does it do anything slightly original? NOO.\r\nIs it funny? That depends.\r\nThe story, setting and characters are largely irrelevant for a comedy show, and like all comedy shows Konosuba lives and dies on whether it is funny or not. To me it's not funny, Konosuba follows similar humor of Baka test, ie. addressing tropes of harem fantasy genre. But for me, this genre is already way too cancerous to be funny, and the jokes are things that had been done before andbetter. \\n\\n\r\nMost of all, I compare all fantasy work that have a high female ratio to Touhou, and ask myself, does this do anything Touhou hasn't done in the last two decades, and if not, why aren't I watching Touhou?\\n\\n\r\nIts kind of obvious that Konosuba fails on this front.\\n\\n\r\nGoddess with no charisma?

            "content": "There goes KonoSuba! What an hell of a ride it has been!\r\nHonestly, at first glance Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! (God's Blessings on this Wonderful World!) or simply put as KonoSuba, feels nothing groundbreaking in a sense that its set in an RPG world, with the protagonist being a hardcore gamer and a shut-in, and on top of that its supposed to be a parody and a light comedy show. This is where it proves all the odds wrong by throwing a totally absurd, non-sensical whack job that forces the viewer to shut all his reasonings for a moment and simply sit back andtake a piece of what's on offer. KonoSuba is one of those rare shows that is legitimately funny, and actually make you laugh with dialogues that are supposed to. What makes this show just brilliant is that its not a try-hard at whatever it does, but simply offers you what its genuinely good at, and that is to make the viewer piss his pants by laughing. \\n\\n\r\nLike how laudable is that for a show, that dares to mix in all the elements and different genres, to go on and satisfy our needs to the fullest? You have a setting in an imaginary world inside like that of an RPG, you have cute moe girls that are set up with our supposedly miserable MC which creates a harem, and an endless amount of fanservice on offer. With all that added up, KonoSuba still manages to feed every category and does it without ever holding back. Now I said that the MC is supposed to be a loser who's a shut-in and obsessed with games, but in all fairness I will say that he's one of the coolest fellows I've ever seen gracing an anime. Kazuma Satou is his identification and he DIES within a minute of episode 1. Don't worry, its not a certain popular shounen anime of the past, but a start to this extraordinary and at the same time silly adventure he's going to take part in. So as he dies, he's sent to an unexisting void where he meets a cocky Goddess, that tells him to make one of the two choices given to him to in order to decide what his afterlife would be like -- To go to Heaven; which is supposedly a boring place where only old people take solace in or in an entirely alternate world, where its total chaos caused by the Demon King to whom the people live in fear of and it would mean their freedom if the Demon King is defeated. \\n\\n\r\nIt's inevitable what Kazuma would choose as his fate to be, as a hardcore gamer who can experience his wish from his wildest dreams; to be an adventurer and a hero in a world filled with fantasies! He also gets an additional wish fulfilled, that is to have anything he wishes for -- from weapons to superpowers, to aid him on his journey to defeat the Demon King. Interestingly he chooses Aqua, who is none other than the Goddess waiting for Kazuma after his death!\\n\\n\r\nAs unwillingly as she is forced to join Kazuma on his quest, Aqua the Goddess takes on the challenge in order to get back to her original role as a Goddess. At first, the two seem to be a band of misfits, which is apparent by Aqua's arrogant personality and Kazuma's constant teasing of her calling her as a 'Dame-Gami' meaning a Useless Goddess. As the two march forwards they're joined by two other members; Megumin and Darkness. Apparently Megumin is an arch wizard who's a total klutz and clumsy all the time. One of her prominent feature in the show is her love for the technique \"Explosion!\", which is supposedly the strongest wizard attack there is. One setback of Megumin using this technique is it trains out all her energy and she's only able to propel it once at a time. She's often called the crazy girl for her over-exaggerating behavior and that's something she dislikes a lot. Kazuma's telling that he finds 'Megumin' as a weird name pisses her off, too. However, Megumin is one of the funniest character in the show and also the easily likable one. Darkness is a member that joins last in the group. She's a Knight and oddly... a masochist? Apparently she has one problem of missing the target and hitting something insignificant more, but that's just not about it, she has this weird fetish for being turned on in the most despairing situations! As often as her fights are with the villains and enemies, she always quotes the possibility of being overwhelmed in the fight and turning herself in, only to be sexually molested to the opposition's pleasings. And strangely enough, this turns her on even more! Quite excitingly though, this is one of the funniest feature of the whole show. Megumin might be the best girl of the show in my opinion, but I'll definitely ship Darkness and Kazuma more! (Sorry Aqua, try harder in the second season).\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes! Talking about a possibility of having a second season, it's already been announced officially! I only just started this show a day earlier, and as I hit the halfway mark in the show, I was already so excited about the prospect of it having a second season, something which is a first for me!\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the visuals of the show, and as well as the cons of it. The art style of the show throughout is underwhelming to say it in a word, with shoddy production values being evident. It was mediocre to begin with, but it does also shift to a worse position in some sections of the show, with the art being much more goofy than usual. This might be something Studio DEEN suffered from in its run, but its definitely something that wasn't lacking with the show providing plenty of positives that overwhelms the negatives in my opinion. The voice casting also brings in some of the newer personnel than usual we see in anime, but they definitely felt like professionals to me with them being in such a good sync with the characters and their traits as well. Jun Fukushima does an excellent job handling Kazuma and had his voice in perfect shape from one situations to the other. Rie Takahashi's youthful voice goes hand in hand with Megumin's quirky behavior. Kudos to the voice casting for a job very well done. The OP & ED simply do their jobs, they're nothing outstanding nor do they contribute to any expectations to come from the show. The ED is a nice country music-like and is joyful to hear. \\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba isn't touching great heights with its story weaving but its not just a mere comedy show. That's a pure understatement to this show. When I say KonoSuba is legitimately funny, I mean it. With regular chaos-filled fights to the squad quarrels, the dialogues are immersed with excitement. \\n\\n\r\nThis is my only pitch to you, watch KonoSuba and appreciate the entertainment it so wonderfully provides.\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes anime studios surprise me by their ideas, expertly hiding all drawbacks by the good animation and a silly comedy.\r\nGive people great animation, with exciting characters, they immediately lose any logic.\r\nI understand that KonoSuba is primarily a comedy, and talk about some sense, it's silly, because humor, in itself, has no boundaries, but humor in this anime it's a main problem.\r\nBitter talk about it, but humor was never been a strong point in anime, because comedy often try to limit in school genre.\r\nThe problem is that any comedy scene takes place with the participation of someone's girl's pants and mostly with hints Hiki generation. Ido not want to say that comedy in this area was inappropriate, but it continues throughout all ten episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSince we understand this is a comedy,  the viewer is immediately ready to be a lot of absurd things, and in this is collapse of KonoSuba . Showing himself with a humorous side, it continues stretch all ten episodes unchanged. From third episode, when we already seen all characters (about it below) humor is monotonous. All comedy scenes will refer to perversion by female characters and center of all this will be the protagonist. And of course they not forget to show shaking chest all the main women's characters, by the way, some of them even going without underwear.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with death of the main character from shock, he finds himself in so-called purgatory, where goddess invites him to get into another world, with a particular feature that he should think it himself. He chooses to take a goddess with him, and from this begins their way in the new world.\\n\r\nThis world is built by all the canons of MMORPG, to earn money and increase, need to do out quests, with main target kill the King of Demons.\\n\r\nAlthough KonoSuba has a specific goal in mind, it is still have more episodic format, and this is second main problem in this series.\\n\\n\r\nWith its episodic format, some characters are not remembered, while others simply disappear without a purpose in series.\\n\r\nThe four main characters, is actually pretty standard, they are arranged according by rules of the genre \"Harem\".\\n\r\n- Goddess Aqua, a bit silly, not wearing panties, seductive and sometimes useful, serves as a very close girl of protagonist.\\n\r\n- Knight Latalina is worst character, in my opinion, she has a masochistic tendencies that are supposed to entertain audience, perhaps for the first time and it will seem ridiculous, but KonoSuba repeating same jokes throughout of the anime. Not to mention that Knight Warrior is one of the most common characters in hentai.\\n\r\n- What regard Megumin, she plays role of so-called clown in the series. It's strange to talk about it, but it's only character who pulls this anime from the pit.\\n\r\n- Kazuma is a typical retard with flat jokes and do idiotic action.\\n\\n\r\nHowever Art & Animation made at a high level. Environment shown is very beautiful, moments of casting spells, magic and other things made in good style. I think this is only thing that really turned out well. I dont seen a defects in animation of characters, each of them is made beautiful and attracts attention.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and sound, dont have particular drawbacks too. Opening and Ending is average, throughout the series is a good sound in battles.\\n\r\nBut still, look for flaws in music or animation does not make sense, as I previously said that this anime hides all their flaws. And to do bad, then, that immediately catches eye, is to doom himself to failure.\\n\\n\r\nPresenting itself from first episode, as a comedy, KonoSuba doomed themselves to failure. Comedy in this series does not improve the show, conversely only spoil it, by the end it becomes clear what to expect a clever humor is meaningless. All ways go only to a many silly dialogues, to depraved poses and jokes in \"Ecchi\" style.\\n\\n\r\nKono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! - this shows how should not look comedy, it can be considered one of the unsuccessful attempts to make a joke on Hikki generation.",

            "content": "I've always been a firm believer of the idea that you should never judge an anime by its cover alone. There are good and bad examples of series from every single genre after all, and you can never know for sure which side any one specific anime will fall on before you watch it. That being said, you can still normally make some sort of very rough premature estimation for what an anime will be like, and the vast majority of the time you'll probably be right. It's exceedingly rare for an anime to completely blow away whatever initial expectations you may have had onit, and deliver something truly memorable seemingly out of thin air. KonoSuba however is one of those cases.\\n\\n\r\nThe idea of having a shut-in otaku being transported into an RPG-like fantasy world for some convenient reason and immediately ending up with some sort of semi-sexualized female entourage upon arrival is not exactly an original concept at this point. Ever since the enormous financial success of Sword Art Online there has been an absolute surge of new anime following roughly the same idea. But there is one thing which makes KonoSuba a totally different experience from any of the others, and that is that this is nothing more than a parody. There is no cheesy drama, cheap writing or needless clich\u00e9s; hell there's barely even any story progression at all. KonoSuba is a 100% pure comedy, nothing more, nothing less. But it's a really damn funny one at that.\\n\\n\r\nFor one, the defining trait of all the female main characters of this anime is that they're all utterly useless. Firstly there's Aqua, a supposed \"goddess\" but essentially the only thing she's good at is party tricks, and her IQ is on about the level of a goldfish. Secondly, there's best girl of the season Megumin, a chuuni archwizard who has a diehard obsession with explosion magic, and operates on a 24 hour cooldown since it takes all her physical energy to cast even a single spell. And lastly we have \"Darkness\", a righteous knight incapable of even hitting anyone in battle. On the other hand she's very good at tanking as she's also a hardcore masochist who fantasizes about being kidnapped and sexually abused by her demonic enemies on the battlefield. Uhm\u2026 yeah.\\n\\n\r\nThe real icing on the cake though is probably the MC himself. Kazuma is far from your ordinary MMO anime lead, nor your typical harem protagonist for that matter. First of all he's actually pretty weak in terms of fighting prowess, and actually feels like the average NEET he's supposed to be. But also the way he talks and acts around the girls from his party is just hilarious. His general mindset would be something along the lines of \"ahh~ I'm surrounded by morons, someone please shoot me\". He serves both as the tsukkomi to all the stupid shit the girls are doing all the time, as well as the one who has to clean up the mess they make. He can be a bit abusive every once in a while, but most of the time it's perfectly warranted, and even when it's not it's still done in a very light-hearted and comedic fashion. I've seen some people try to overanalyze this anime and look for deeper political messages and stuff, but I implore you to *please* don't do that. Like really, what's the point? This is a pure comedy anime and not something which should be taken seriously whatsoever. Let's leave it that way, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, there's not really a whole lot to say about the plot other than that it follows Kazuma and his party's daily lives as they struggle to get enough money to get food on the table and a better place to sleep than in the stables. However, with constant mishaps along their way, often cause by some rather idiotic things done by certain party members, this turns out to be a lot easier said than done. You won't be seeing any epic boss fights or life-or-death drama in this RPG; just a bunch of weirdos making fools out of themselves in low-level quests. But honestly... I vastly prefer it this way.\\n\\n\r\nNow if there is anything to really complain about in this anime then it's quite clearly the animation. Saying that this is a low budget production would be an understatement. The character designs actually look pretty terrible a lot of the time, with awkward facial structures and hilarious derp faces. However... this actually isn't always a bad thing. A lot of comedic moments are actually *enhanced* by this. Like the reaction faces to certain gags just come across as even funnier than if they had been drawn properly, and since KonoSuba is purely a comedy anime it's actually not really a problem if you look at it that way. Of course this excuse isn't always applicable though, as the bad character designs are often prevalent during non-comedic moments as well, and in that case there's no upside to it anymore. So it depends on how you look at it. Interestingly enough though, the backgrounds, and not to mention the special effects for Megumin's spells, actually look really good. It's really just the character designs that are broken.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, KonoSuba is only a 10-episode anime, which is probably further evidence of the very limited budget the studio had to work with. However, those were 10 damn good episodes so I can't really feel too disappointed about it. Also despite the low budget, this has been by far the most successful show of Winter 2016 financially speaking, with the light novel's sales having absolutely skyrocketed ever since the anime began airing. And the results speak for themselves, as a second season has already been greenlit, so there's plenty more goodness to come in due time. Maybe they'll even have a proper budget this time around.\\n\\n\r\nIt's been quite some time since I saw an anime as jam-packed with entertainment value as KonoSuba has been, and even longer since I saw a better comedy. And given that it didn't even look like a gag show to begin with, that's really saying something. But maybe that'll help serve as a subtle reminder that judging an anime by its cover is in fact never a good thing to do. You never know what you might miss out on.",

            "content": "\"Too good to be just a comedy,\" that is how I originally felt at first about this show. Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! To begin, Kono-Suba is a parody of almost every other RPG/Fantasy game or anime ever made. What it does though (obviously I might add) is pokes fun at them while remaining unique in it's own way. Every time I watched a new episode, it was sort of like the events that took place were in between predicable and unpredictable. What worked out in it's favor is that the shows unpredictable nature. Certain moments surprised, like came out of nowhere me amade make me laugh my ass off. \\n\\n\r\nStory- 7/10\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the story, I really admired creativity and uniqueness. To me, it was sort of like Natsume Akatsuki (Original creator) and later the producers of Studio Deen watched a bunch of fantasy anime or played a bunch of games and said \"hey, you see how serious this Goddess is? what if she wasn't so serious? what if we added such a crazy personality to her\" and things kind of lifted off the ground from there. The final result, the thing that actually matters is what makes me believe that it was well put together. There were most likely lots of people in the development of KonoSuba who have had countless hours, days, years, of experience watching or playing fantasy games along with the original creator to make this show feel so accurate. I personally believe that Studio Deen did a great job with this series. I think that one of the many things that makes an anime great is the studio and creators enthusiasm and passion for a project. When you watch this show, which I would highly recommend, you can tell by the pacing and flow of the show that the creators had a really good time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the number one thing that I loved so much about KonoSuba is the characters. Though it's possible, I don't think I could have asked for a better cast of characters for this show. Aqua, Kazuma, Megumin and \"Darkness\" are hilarious in their own unique and respective ways. Although some characters are more favorable than others, I personally found myself very found of Megumin, I mean who couldn't like a little girl whose only magic is EXPLOSION!! I find her hilarious, and its' always fun seeing her in action. Aqua is perhaps my second favorite because her personality reminds me of another favorite character of mine from a similar show No Game No Life. Aside from that Aqua's natural, I'm actually going to say natural habit of getting the party into trouble is always fun to watch. I just find it very difficult for myself to dislike any of the characters. In fact going back to that \"predictable and unpredictable\" statement I made earlier that is something that really works with them. It's like some episodes you don't know who is going to be useful or not. Because it's part of the shows genre, and I want to touch on it a little with this being a harem and all, I am really glad to see that there seems to be (at the moment at least) no romance. Personally, and I am really hoping that (unless there is a season 2) there is no romantic relationships between the characters, I like that Kazuma can be the perverted \"Hikikomori\" or \"neet\" whatever he is freely without having to think so much about romance, or \"love.\" I personally think that also works out in the shows favor. I mean, having him fall in love with one of the ladies in his part might be possible however I just do not see it happening. One last thing that I want to add, and this depends on the viewers but at times characters can come off as a bit annoying. i personally found myself annoyed at times with Aqua, Megumin, Kazuma's and Darkness's behaviors.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, with the art and animation, it's pretty damn good! we have late 2012-14 animation style going on here. That works great with this show, I do not think they could have chosen a better style for this show. Especially because it had moments, great moments, where I found myself admiring most of the background settings and main focuses example being fights. My most favorite by far was the fight scene between Dullahan and Kazuma's squad. The sound effects, and background music used during this scene really enhanced my viewing pleasure. That aside there are just a numerous amount of scenes in this show where the music and art is visually stunning and spectacular, again please check out this series if you haven't already.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSomething that I really want to add, in addition to the show being \"great\" or me saying that it's too good to be just a comedy earlier. The comedy was at first a pain in the ass for me. When I started the show I thought is was absolutely frustrating to see a show with such great potential to be something greater wasted. It wasn't until around episode 4 that the comedic parts sank in and it completely changed my view on the show. Aside from the \"serious nature\" all of the elements in Konosuba works. There are so many things for fans of both old and new fantasy adventure anime can enjoy. Whether you love the music, art, characters, fan service or just the story, everything in Konosuba sort of plays out kind of naturally for all to enjoy. Personally, although possible of course, I would find this show moderately hard to disapprove of among even the most experienced reviewers and critics. Now to wrap things up, Konosuba in my opinion was a fun work of art. It had potential to be something even greater, it was memorable, and will most likely be a show that fans (such as myself) will definitely keep talking about later down the road. I personally, hope to see a season 2 further down the road. Konsuba totally deserves another run. I think this show deserves and has earned 3rd place for best anime of Winter 2015.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts-\\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave this show a 9/10 because it did a great job in all departments, art, animation, character etc. What really played into my rating though was wonderfully hilarious characters.. I could not have asked for any changes in the characters' department Natsume Akatsuki did a really great job making likable, cute and such awesome characters.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Here is an attitude that tends to dishearten me a little: why are people so hostile to douchebag protagonists? Sure, if you are supposed to like or sympathize with an asshole it becomes a big turn off, as it makes the series hypocritical and morally bankrupt, like Zero no Tsukaima (I had to take that jab!), but when that is not the case, having a main lead with very visible flaws can give a very clear idea of a future character arc and make such lead a more interesting figure, That aside, what if the series is about none of that? What if the respectivetitle is not so much a comedy of errors, but a comedy of wrong people? That is certainly a way of getting an easily likeable douche as your lead.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are not bored by the intro I just gave, allow me to tell you why \u201cKono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!\u201d, or KonoSuba for short, is awesome and you should watch it.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve been paying attention to the anime community at least in the last two years or so, you\u2019re likely to have noticed a trend that has become infamous among light novel adaptations: an incredibly bland and overpowered main character, who blazes through the story effortlessly obliterating his enemies, while developing a harem for himself with the gravitational pole of his Mary Sue genitals. This trend is specially exemplified by titles like Sword Art Online, Asterisk Wars, Overlord, The Irregular at Magic Highschool, etc, and as much as it has been gathering very vocal hatred, it also seems reluctant to fade away. KonoSuba, in the other hand, seems to be a title crafted in diametric opposition to such trends, having a set up that is, on the most surface level possible, similar, but diverging highly in how it plays out.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are curious about why I called this series a comedy of wrong people, it\u2019s because none of the characters that receive the focus of the story is characterized as fit for the tasks they face and the plot itself doesn\u2019t care about raising them as unlikely heroes, but instead on exploiting them in the silly RPG-like situations they find themselves into. KonoSuba is a parody in its simplest and most charming form: it\u2019s not focused on big and over-the-top events that take the piss out of the genre by relying on absurdity, but it builds its narrative on small comedic events that stack up, creating multiple consistent punchlines that don\u2019t cease being a part of the world the series created. From the giant frogs that lead the crew to find a new member, to the Succubus prostitutes that motivate the warriors to defend the city against overwhelming odds, every joke has an in-universe purpose. \\n\\n\r\nAll that aside, let\u2019s talk about the characters a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist, Kazuma, is the unlucky male lead who got thrown into this phantasy world by his unwillingness to go to heaven and staying a virgin for the rest of eternity. Can\u2019t blame the guy, I\u2019d do the same in his place. Despite what I said in the introduction, Kazuma is not exactly a lead designed with the purpose of being unlikeable, although being still a snarky prick (I can actually relate to that!) and somewhat of a troll, with no shame on taking advantage of the situation in ways that lead to embarrassment to others. A former shut-in and the most frequent voice of reason of his group of air-heads, his situation of the world of KonoSuba is surprisingly relatable: he is constantly facing failure, with only occasional moments of success and hardly earned achievements to motivate him and his group to stay on the journey.\\n\\n\r\nAqua is an idiot, and one of the best kind. Unlike other shows where the idiot of the bunch is only responsible for bringing misfortune to his colleagues and never becomes aware of how much their stupidity costs to others, Aqua faces first-hand the effects of her actions. Being the lovably greedy and selfish twat she is and desperate to get out of the world she got stuck in, Aqua is constantly making reckless decisions and engaging in equally ill-thought out actions, only to have Kazuma stop or save her, so that she can incur in the same mistakes again, in the vain attempt of getting some easy money and more confortable situation. The contrast of such egocentric behavior with her lack of wit and constant misfortune makes some of the best comedic takes of the series.\\n\\n\r\nNext is Megumi, the overly-confident, but hopelessly underprepared mage of the group. Prideful of her alleged \u201ccrimson demon\u201d origins and unconditionally infatuated with explosive spells, the most powerful brand of offensive magic, she refuses to learn any other kind of spell, even though her body is clearly unprepared to handle such taxing kind of magic. The comedy of her character comes mostly from passing out whenever she unleashes her attacks, being made completely vulnerable against enemies and putting the burden of her protection on her colleagues. I now realized that this doesn\u2019t sound funny at all, but trust me, in context in works wonders, especially in contrast with the already precarious state of her party.\\n\\n\r\nLastly there\u2019s Darkness, the noble swordswoman with high stats in offense and defense, but laughably low accuracy, which means she\u2019ll be swinging that sword a lot, but rarely hitting anything besides the punch line. She is also a massive masochist, a trope that I\u2019ve personally become very fond in recent times. She latches onto the party under the belief that Kazuma is a perverted sadist who mistreats and humiliates the other girls, essentially all she wants for herself. In the long run she ends up placing great trust on Kazuma, and the series even hints of a possible romantic development between them, although that is not completely reliable, being this also a harem style comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe meat of KonoSuba\u2019s comedic energy (in simpler terms, the reason why it\u2019s so funny) is its focus on the small moments. The comedy is not so much focused on slapstick, although that is also a significant portion of it, but in quick character reactions that stand on their respective quirks and flaws of personality: Aqua is an impatient, selfish idiot, so she is bound to react desperate and childish when the prospect of financial loss is near; Megumi is overly confident and stubborn, so she boasts her power just to fall flat on her face right after, in more ways than the literal one; Darkness is a masochist and gleefully enjoys her own pain even when embarrassingly trying to hide it. Kazuma, however, is the character that takes the most out of it. Being a snarky douche, he will often be confronted with the girl\u2019s unwanted traits and react in ways to tangentially distance himself, like in the running gag:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cKazuma!\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cHi, Hi, Kazuma desu!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nHe is also quick to take advantage in the most fitting opportunity, like immediately attacking a knight when challenged to a fight where he is obviously disadvantaged, just to end it in a hilarious slapstick sequence. Huh, I might have killed that joke for anyone who has not watched it already! The series doesn\u2019t slow down in such antics even as it dives into \u201cdecisive\u201d battles and it plays its comedy as characters are about to face immense danger. When you think it\u2019s about to attempt some misplaced drama, KonoSuba pull itself back again with a joke built upon the same scene, never fully attempting to be heavy and dramatic, a mistake that other less sharp parody series make far too often.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I have often discussed when talking about presentation is the importance of keeping consistency in character models, as it is the most glaring flaw for animation to incur and can be specially detracting to the purpose the scene wants to convey. In the case of KonoSuba, though, it\u2019s somewhat of a pointless complaint to make, since this is one of the aspects the series relies on to drive its comedy. Many of the comedic takes focus on facial expression to emphasize characters reactions, so it\u2019s not unusual for them to have distorted and exaggerated features. This also works in the fanservice shots, when boobs will bounce aimlessly, to the point of killing the sexual appeal and turning it into a joke itself.\\n\\n\r\nPossibly to match the watery feel of the expressions and designs, the color pallet is also very light, with clear shades of blue, green and yellow, for example. Costumes, in the other hand, are quite vibrant and distinguish immediately from the characters themselves. Another aspect that contributes greatly to the action and humor is the movement, very smooth and unhinged, which gives a constant sense of energy at play, helping take the most out of the comedic sequences. It\u2019s actually surprising how little time goes by in the series without any movement happening on each frame.\\n\\n\r\nSound-wise, the main cast is mostly composed of actors who have yet to reach the hundreds of roles played, with the exception of Kayano Ai, but nonetheless deliver their performances in stellar fashion. Not only being each one a perfect fit for their respective characters, both in tone and pitch, but their delivery solidly lands the jokes with  precise timing. Special notes for Fukushima Jun (not Fukuyama, His Highness is yet to appear in this universe), who portrays Kazuma and never misses the point with the characters, both in his detached \u201cI\u2019m not even part of this group\u201d demeanor, as in his mischievous moments.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Ramblings\\n\\n\r\nHumor is a very subjective part of fiction, so it\u2019s hardly ever possible to say that something is objectively not funny. I believe however, it is possible to debate to some extent whether something is good comedy or not. That can be argue not only on the matter of \u201cdoes it make the audience laugh?\u201d, but also on how is the set up established, is the humor random or streamlined, do the characters stay consistent in their roles, does the writing ever descend into low brow humor, and if yes, does it treat the audience as at least intelligent people, and so forth. These aspect are, of course, open to subversion, depending on the writers talent to pull it off.\\n\\n\r\nNot many shows are able to make comedy out of incompetence without offering some balance. Most commonly, they will focus most of the punch lines on very specific characters while at the same time offering one as the trump card to solve conflict. What makes KonoSuba so endearing is its ability to make all of the characters into irreplaceable components of the jokes, without diminishing the value of any of them in the context of its universe. As much as the main party is overall composed of incompetent misfits to work out the comedy, they are all also important for the progression, even if accidentally. Well, perhaps better off accidentally, as it makes for even more outrageous outcomes, constantly adding up to the fun.\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba\u2019s crew of incompetent loonies may not be the best folks around when it comes to defeating the Demon King, but they sure were the best to turn a generic adventure into such an endearing trip to a world that is perhaps as wonderful as the title implies.\\n",

            "content": "Disclaimer: If you dislike fanservice and boob jiggles, this is not the anime for you. Bras don't seem to exist in the KonoSuba world and sexual jokes are everywhere. And now, the tl;dr:\r\nPros:\r\n1. The premise is new and interesting, being a parody of those RPG anime.\r\n2. The ED is very chill and nonsensical, which fits KonoSuba well.\r\nCons: \r\n1. Running jokes are reused too much without any changes.\r\n2. The characters are very one-dimensional.\r\n3. The story is rather choppy and at least one important arc is left out.\r\nThe premise of KonoSuba is about a very weak party in an alternate world resembling an RPG to parody theOP main characters of similar warp-into-a-game anime. However, I'm not one to watch this kind of anime much, so I can't say how effective it is or how refreshing it is to have a weak protagonist, but it is certainly a very interesting premise.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is pretty nice too. It is very relaxing and the lyrics don't really mean much. It fits the day-to-day goings of KonoSuba like a glove.\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba has pretty serious issues, however. It uses a few running jokes that are never really pulled off well. As a result, by ep 5 I got pretty bored of the comedy, especially the jokes involving Aqua and Darkness. Megumin also has running jokes associated with her, although I would say that hers are much better used by adapting to the context.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the characters are pretty much just their running jokes, making them extremely one-dimensional. Character development is totally non-existent, and interactions between Kazuma and Aqua or Darkness are always the same. The only main character who is an exception to this is, again, Megumin who is more of a proper character by being able to respond differently to different situations without relying on her main gag. But this is supposed to be the bare minimum of a character.\\n\\n\r\nTowards the end of the season, a few new characters appear out of nowhere with no history whatsoever within the anime, and one of them is pretty important. So it boggles me as to why the arc which introduces this character is only given a brief mention as a passing comment, and the viewers are expected to know who this character is.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, KonoSuba honestly fails as a comedy anime and its story goes nowhere. I can only really recommend this to those who are super hardcore about the isekai/game genre or those who really love parodies.",

            "content": "\"I'm an advocate of true gender equality, a guy who has no problem with doling out a drop kick to a female opponent. Don't think I'll go easy on you!\" -Kazuma Satou\r\nKono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! KonoSuba. God's Blessing On This Wonderful World. An anime that has taken so many people by surprise, at how tear-inducingly hilarious and amazing this turned out to be. After an insipid and uninspired first episode, I was not the least bit interested in this. I had thought this was going to turn out to be just another one of those generic fantasy series that comes out every season,with no particular defining quality or trait. Just another one of those anime whose only remotely memorable feature was the length of the name - and it isn't even that long by LN standards. Nothing interesting at all.\\n\\n\r\nBoy, I've never been so wrong. I'm so glad I don't drop things after a single episode, because I would have missed out on the absolute gem that KonoSuba turned out to be. The second episode took me completely by surprise. By the time it finished, I found myself questioning whether this was the same anime whose first episode I had watched a week prior. The hilarity came out of nowhere. The last thing I was expecting was for a single episode to completely revert my initially negative impression.\\n\\n\r\nBut anyway, enough with my monologuing. KonoSuba's premise is a simple one - after a very eccentric and ridiculous death, Kazuma Satou finds himself before the self-proclaimed Goddess Aqua, with the option to pass on to the afterlife, or be reborn into a new world where his mission would be to defeat Demon King in order to return back to his old life. He's also given one wish to be granted by Aqua in order to aid him in his endeavours.\\n\r\nThis is where we begin to see the way in which KonoSuba breaks away from the mould. Kazuma's brilliant idea is to wish for the Goddess Aqua herself to accompany him - why stick to a singular wish, when he could simply take the wish-granter herself along with hiim? This more practical manner of thinking begets hilarity after hilarity as the anime goes on.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a simple one. Defeat the Demon King, and go home. That's it. There's no grand, overlying scheme; no complex themes one has to scrutinise in detail in order to understand what's going on; nothing more than the simple premise for which everything takes place. This works in the anime's favour, because having such a loose goal means they can pretty much do anything they want inbetween, so long as it in some way takes them even a little closer towards the ultimate defeat of the Demon King.\\n\r\nAs the episodes go by, more characters are gradually introduced. In order to kill the Demon King, Kazuma and Aqua need a stronger and bigger party. This leads to them encountering Megumin and Darkness. From here on out, their adventurers and encounters are nothing short of zany, bizarre and ridiculous. Aqua the Goddess, Megumin the ArchWizard and Darkness the Crusader - all of these are exceptional people, holding classes and abilities which the common person could only dream of having. But despite their apparent prowess, it would not be possible to have a more dysfunctional party.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nIt is these characters and their interactions which make this such an amazing comedy. Kazuma is the glue that holds everything together. It is his cynical, practical and down-to-earth mentality that acts as the wall to the antics of the rest of his party. Without him, they would all fall apart; if not for him then achieving anything would be impossible thanks to their ridiculous flaws and inability to do anything without hazard. His reactions to all the misfortunes that befall him thanks to them never fail to entertain.\\n\\n\r\nAqua possesses no qualities one would expect of a Goddess. She is selfish. She is greedy. She's a gold-digger. She is lazy. She is demanding. Her first concern is herself; she has no other concerns. She can use a few anti-Undead spells, but is otherwise nearly useless in combat. She also has a knack of making everything worse, causing unnecessary damage and shifting all of the debt she incurs onto Kazuma.\\n\r\nMegumin suffers from a mild dose of chuunibyou, and excels in one partcular magic - explosions. She lives and breathes for them. She knows no other magic, as she does not believe any other magic to be needed. So long as she can blow something up, nothing else matters. This sounds good on paper, but she's only capable of casting one explosion before fainting from exhaustion.\\n\r\nDarkness is the Crusader - the beefy tank that takes the enemies' attention and soaks up the damage. She wields a massive sword capable of cleaving men in two... That is, assuming she can hit them. Her accuracy is shoddy if one were to describe it generously. Furthermore, she's a hardcore masochist. She loves being abused. Being pinned down and attacked - be it by friend or foe - is her creme de la creme.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to taking on quests, the 3 main girls are nothing short of useless - a fact Kazuma never fails to mention. His comments, interjections and general abuse hit them all right where it hurts. He never fails to remind Aqua she's a useless Goddess. He desperately tries to encourage Megumin to learn other magic. He's genuinely disturbed by Darkness' fetish. These problem-riddled girls provide an endless well of entertainment as Kazuma tries his utmost to simply get by each day without falling into debt and despair.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation.\\n\r\nThe art and animation is the worst aspect of this series. The art is quite plain and sometimes off. The eyes of the character seem a little too spaced apart. Whilst not being bad, the art really could do with some improvement. The animation is occasionally wonky, too. This was especially prevalent in one particular episode where boob-physics were quite...Fascinating, shall we say.\\n\r\nHowever, this was never able to detract from my enjoyment because I was too busy wiping the tears induced from laughing out of my eyes to care about the art. I'll also point out that Megumin's explosion sequence in particular actually looked really good. It is apparent a lot of effort was put into that; considering how frequently we saw her explosions this was a massive boon.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion.\\n\r\nKonoSuba - God's Blessing On This Wonderful World - was most certainly a blessing. This subverted every single opinion and impression I initially had. It very quickly - nay, INSTANTLY - rose to the position of my favourite anime from the Winter 2016 season. This is hands down one of the funniest anime I've ever had the fortune of watching. Kazuma is one of those rare male MCs who actually manages to steal the spotlight from his harem. His reactions, his methods of coping, everything he does makes this anime better. Without him acting as the sole voice of reason, those girls would have destroyed themselves. The contrast between his rationality and their insanity made for never-ending hilarity.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch this? Abso-fucking-lutely! Comedy is entirely subjective. Not everyone will like it; that's only natural. But give this 3-4 episodes before deciding. Wait until all the characters are introduced, because they all bring a different dynamic to the table. Their sole similarity is their uselessness. If you still find yourself unamused, then that's a shame. But otherwise, you're in for one Hell of a ride.\\n\r\nThe one and only problem with KonoSuba is that it's only 10 episodes long. Aside from this crime against humanity? KonoSuba has ran away with my expectations. I loved it. Hopefully you will too.\\n",

            "content": "My first review,  please read with joy :D\r\nKonoSuba beats most of the comedies of last year by FAR! I haven't laughed so much with an anime since I watched Noucome , Gintama was close and so was Nozaki Kun .... \r\nKonoSuba characters are each individually funny in their own circumstances . You might be thinking this is another rip off of similar anime's settings like SAO , Dungeon ni Deal . But my oh my you have thought otherwise. KonoSuba provides me with all the Positive vibes I hoped for. \r\nStory - 6\r\nKazuma our MC is grouped up with probably the 3 most troublesomeclan members you'd ever want to have. \\n\r\nIt doesn't have a serious plot to it, but one of the more cliche and generic ones where the MC has been tasked with defeating the Demon King in the new world he has been reincarnated into. The episodes itself don't really progress with the plot because the group itself is isolated in one town. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation + Art - 7\\n\r\nAt first you might think the art maybe off-putting , I did at first and I know a small minority probably did as well.  But as you watch more and more, the art is more of a Gain then a loss . The character designs are really unique in the sense that each character has there own unique dress code that makes them stand out. \\n\r\nThe Animation is pretty average but is highly favorable and suited to the personalities and expressions of each character . But on some occasions has been poor as if the animators were high whilst animating.\\n\r\nBut one thing it animated brilliantly.  ARE THE BOOBS!!! I have never witnessed such Boob Mechanics in an anime before. Scientists need to study this and evaluate the Philosophy behind this. Because I have no idea why it has been animated this way. NOT THAT I'M COMPLAINING :)\\n\r\nOn the other hand , I do believe Michael Bay would love to watch the explosion scenes and take some notes to use for his new Transformer installments xD\\n\\n\r\nSound + Music + Voice - 7.5\\n\r\nThe Opening isn't my cup of tea . I wouldn't repeatedly listen to it on a daily basis and have occasionally skipped it, whilst watching episodes . It's definitely not as catchy and memorable as some of the other openings this Winter. Such as in Dimension W , Erased or Gate Season 2. \\n\r\nHowever, I will give credit to the ending song which is far more soothing and relaxing to listen to. \\n\r\nKazuma Seiyuu (Fukushima, Jun) deserves more recognition and defo needs more casting roles in the future . I adore his voice .  The overall cast itself is really suited to each character in which is the reason as to why i have noted this as 7.5 . If just music alone I would of probably given it a 4 or 5.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\r\nKazuma - Probably my All time Favorite MC.  He is just so lovable in a sense that I could go Gay for him. ( P.S I'm Joking ) . \\n\r\nOn a serious note. Kazuma is pretty useless and ineffective as an individual within the group. He isn't at all OP but has his own strengths when defeating  his opponents who are far more talented then he is . But that is really what makes him one of the Best MC's out there. \\n\r\nAqua - The Clumsy and annoying Goddess in the group. Kazuma would probably go along these lines and say \" You're living, you occupy space , and you have a mass. You Matter\" That's probably what he thought when he reincarnated with her. But she is more of a nuisance, when you think she has been useful to the group on some quests or missions , she makes their budget and life far worse .  \\n\r\nMegumin - The cute one and Micheal Bay's Future Wife. She is pretty useless after she has activated her special ability EXPLOSION!!!! That she ends up paralyzed for a certain amount of time .( Kazuma has it hard )\\n\r\nDarkness-  A Masochist that tends to have perverted thoughts such as the time she was battling one of the Demon Kings Knights. She is useless herself in that she can never seem to hit her target. \\n\r\nAll these characters have there own unique personalities that overall makes the anime far more enjoyable , one thing they do to lack is some development but that doesn't take anything away from how comedically funny they are. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nThis show is my icing on the cake. It has entertained me from its first episode to its last. Shame it was only 10 episodes and only adapted 2 volumes of the LN . But the OVA is soon to air and Season 2 is announced so the hype is real. If you want something to laugh and you really enjoy harem/fantasy/comedy  then watch KonoSuba whenever you have time and marathon it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating 9\\n",

            "content": "\"KonoSuba!\"\r\nI will be very honest before I start this anime review, at first I wasn't going to pick this series up, or lets say I putted this series on a low Top 15 Anticipated of the Winter Season 2016 because of the studio behind it being DEEN. And as you guys do know, DEEN is a studio that tends to have... let's say \"horrible\" animation quality or handles. Besides that, the studio was stained due to the apparent adaptation of Fate/stay Night 2006. This brings to me a lot of questions since it's a nitpick for me to pick this series up. However, looking througha bit more, I decided to give this anime a shot. And what did my reaction was regarding on this anime? Let's find out.\\n\\n\r\nNote to the viewer that's reading this review of KonoSuba, firstly everyone has their subjective opinion regarding on the comedy aspect, so a note to the reader, this is not objectively speaking. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe story is set in a fantasy world where basically, the story starts off our little NEET character Kazuma, continuing his little life of otaku, when suddenly when walking around back to the house, he suddenly sees a person almost getting killed by a truck, so in a desperate attempt to save the character, Kazuma pushed her out of the way, thus causing to die in the act.\\n\\n\r\nHe then meet this goddess also known as Aqua, where she then gave him a request or a chance to live in the other world, but he can also take something with him. His quest is to defeat the evil Demon King, after him taking the object that he wants to take, Aqua and Kazuma ended up in this fantasy world, where basically they have to do quests, missions, etc.\\n\\n\r\nNow this is basically your stereotypical \"stuck in a fantasy world\" aspect (just like Log Horizon and Sword Art Online), which many people or some people do not really like the idea. However, KonoSuba takes this type of aspect of the show and makes it its own, by making fun of the fantasy-tropes or aspect, making it seem very refreshing for me. Not only that it helps to stand out, but subjectively its very funny with its comedic fashion direction.\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba takes the direction of also self-awareness, thus the show does know what its trying to do and knows what its doing, which helps a lot with the parody of itself. It's a good way for the series to have different segments of events, from the beginning of \"Kazuma dying because of said reasons (not spoiling here)\" towards the hilarious quirks such as the cabbage scene, the entire curse effect, etc.\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba personally does its job to keep me entertained for the long run time, as its very comedic and relaxing to watch, this is a series that I personally love, and watch it first from the Wednesdays time-run. Its a show that keeps me interested at least along with the character section. \\n\\n\r\nThe only complaint that I have for the series its the amount of episodes this series got, due to the time-run being 10 episodes, it makes me want to crave me for it. Of course its pretty obvious for me to get craved for it, but that's personal. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand at the end of the final episode, when everyone thought DEEN wouldn't make a second season (of course since as far as I'm concerned DEEN doesn't make that many sequels with the exception of maybe a few) they quickly announced right off the bat a second season coming. Which is good because not only that the show did well with what it had, but it deserved it as well. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the series is fun and entertaining to watch at the end of the day. I would warn that if you're expecting something deep or well written story telling with meanings, I wouldn't suggest this one, this one is only relaxing and a pass the time series for the audience and for the fans of comedy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nSo basically we have a so called \"Stereotypical MC with 3 girls around him.\" Right? In a way yes, but at the very least these characters can stand out on their own thanks to their characterization and their little quirks that makes them enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nKazuma, our main male protagonist, is one of the most interesting main male characters I've seen in a while, and probably one of the funniest guys I've seen around as well in a while. Because for some reason, his commentaries on certain events or situations makes me enjoy the show a lot, and people could say he's pretty much overpowered. Or very strong. You could complain and pick as a flaw, but in all honesty, in spite of that Kazuma's quirks are just very well done, and thought enough to make him likeable for the long-running. Not only that but his prior knowledge around gaming fantasy are pretty nice per say. I will say he's one of the most likeable characters around this season personally, based personality wise.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, we got Aqua which she's the goddess of the world where she resided. The girl can be considered debatable, because at one hand people say she's funny as fuck and likeable, the other hand people would say that she's pretty much retarded in many ways. Personally, I can agree Aqua is pretty idiotic, but in a rather funny way that makes her special and likeable. It's really funny how she gets into these type of issues and problems in which I cannot stop laughing and neither stop feeling bad for the girl. Not only that but her face is too cute when she makes the sad expressions.\\n\\n\r\nThirdly we have Megumin, our little \"EXPLOSIONS\" character. She's pretty much considered a Chuunin if you think about Rika Takanashi from Chuunibyou. She's very energetic at times, loves to play with explosions and ONLY that, she goes over exaggerated with her sentences/dialogue which makes er pretty enjoyable. Not only that but she's pretty cute, and pretty laughable when she uses the explosions magic, which she has an apparent limit of using it once per day and she falls down in a rather comedic fashion. She's one of the best girls of the series.\\n\\n\r\nLastly we got Darkness, which she's the sadist character among the cast, and she looks like a freaking armor because she likes a lot of pain, and gets arousements from it. She's considered as a masochist in the series which I'm not going to lie, she is pretty damn funny when she gets these arousements of denials and protecting. Like holy shit that I won't lie she's pretty laughable. But not only that she's a knight. I LOVE knights.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the supporting characters, they aren't really memorable per say, but at the same time they aren't bland either. I just felt like they could have taken a little role of course, but I guess that's asking too much personally. On the other hand not gonna lie, some of the characters even though they don't appear much seem to have the appeal for me, so that's a bonus.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\\n\r\nAs I said previously, this series is a product from DEEN, the same studio who brought us shows such as Fate/stay Night 2006, Kore wa Zombie desu ka?, the massive Boy love animes for fangirls to enjoy!(Junjou Romantica and Sekaiichi Hatsukoi), Higurashi na ku koro ni, etc. \\n\\n\r\nWhile this is more debatable, people would go for either sides. Again, DEEN is pretty much a studio that has a lack for art/animation quality many times in some animes, however for KonoSuba, there's a thing that keeps me to my attention.\\n\\n\r\nAt one hand people would go and say that the art/animation is pretty horrible, and doesn't help with the designs nor the series, at the other hand, its pretty good for the series.\\n\\n\r\nThis case I will go for the either sides. Let me go to the perspective of the show. \\n\\n\r\nBased upon the character designs, I will agree base on the Light Novel readers (some of them) that the artstyle for the designs aren't the greatest there to live up to the source or the Illustrations (Mishima Kurone), however does it make the character designs bad? Not really personally.\\n\\n\r\nLike I do agree that the character designs could be done better, but because of the series being a comedy, the art and animation helps a lot with the series with the quirks and the events happening, even though the animation derps would look pretty bad, it actually works for the series because the expressions gives emphasis of the comedy factor. It helps a lot to make the series more laughable than what it should be, which I appreciate the studio and its animators to make the series work with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe only issue I would have with the animation would be the drop a lot quality for the 9th episode, as it was still laughable, but you can really see the massive derps everywhere in the anime. Which I can't deny it was pretty... I don't want to say it, but pretty eh? Pretty much.\\n\\n\r\nApart from that the background art does not look bad at all. It actually works with the character designs of the series, it gives a bright color scheme and suitable atmosphere with it, as well with the series surroundings. It helps a lot with the series personally.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the entire art/animation quality is quite debatable, but I personally would say that this department is the biggest spotlight around the series because of its usage of animation for the comedic factor of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound/Voice Acting:\\n\\n\r\nI would say that the music... isn't quite memorable actually. I mean, it DOES help with some events of the anime and it gives a more humorous tone to it, and a bit of spark as well, however I don't think it's anything memorable factor personally. Now it doesn't mean that the music is bad of course, it's just the weakest factor of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department is quite actually very nice appealing for the series, I won't deny for the sound department it helps as well with the series although I will say I had some issues with some of the tones they used for the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part about the department is personally the voice acting. The voices of the characters helps to make these characters more vivid and humorous, which for Kazuma, Aqua, Darkness, Megumin, all did their respective roles very well in representation, and I love that, its pretty nice to make these characters have some sort of liveliness.\\n\\n\r\nFor the Opening and the Ending song, I will say the Opening is more like the \"Happy Jolly\" type, its pretty catchy as well with being too cute personally. Not only that but when Aqua appears when introducing the episode name is pretty nice and cuuuuute. Yeah too much saying cute right?\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Ending... I'm not really a fan of this... its pretty much your stereotypical ending song, it appeals to the visuals, but as a standalone its not my favorite.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI will honestly say despite the hole left inside of me when the series left (for now), I still enjoyed its ride from the beginning towards the end, regardless of the complaints people made with the animation and the art (exception for the 9th episode), and its a series that has this stereotypical setting but made itself stand out from the others because of the direction this series took. Which I totally love a lot about it. From the characters, towards the comedy, etc.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nI would really recommend KonoSuba a lot, personally this is one of those series that has a lot of enjoyment out of it, and its one of the best series around Winter 2016 for me personally. I would recommend the show towards people that likes comedy a lot, and wants a pass the time series to just have fun.\\n\\n\r\nWho shouldn't I recommend?\\n\\n\r\nI guess if people are looking for something rather deep or complex, something different (I mean many people do not like these things) I would suggest:\\n\\n\r\n- Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu (another show made by DEEN in the same season, but with having story telling for these type of people)",

            "content": "First of all, I\u2019m a girl, probably not the audience the makers of this anime had in mind. I found myself annoyed with stuff that I think most boys won\u2019t complain over. Second, the whole \u2018game/fantasy world trope\u2019 was never my cup of tea. I watched Re:Zero, officially the worst show I ever watched (in my opinion) and I tried to watch SAO, but never got further than the first episode, because I hated everything about. Still, I thought I would give Konosuba a chance and I actually don\u2019t regret it. I enjoyed the first few episodes quite a bit and at some points, Ieven cracked a smile.\\n\\n\r\nBut\u2026 that doesn\u2019t take away that most of the episodes\u2026 were shit. The story wasn\u2019t original to begin with. It is seriously the most overused trope in anime history (except for maybe the \u2018power of friendship\u2019). I can\u2019t say Konosuba had potential, \u2018cause it didn\u2019t. The only thing that was maybe a bit original, was the fact that our main character Kazuma didn\u2019t had a lot of things going for him. Instead of a fancy power, he chose a useless goddess. His fantasy world wasn\u2019t what he dreamt of: he started of as a novice who basically couldn\u2019t do anything. I\u2019m glad that they at least tried to do something different\u2026 Sadly it doesn\u2019t make up for the lack of originality in the rest of the story. Besides from that, Konosuba is also filled with a lot and a lot of fanservice, that I just can't stand. I\u2019ve seen a lot of shows with a goddamn lot of fanservice and it always annoys me, but when they make a whole episode just for the fanservice\u2026 It broke my heart a little. I can take a little fanservice every now and then\u2026 but a whole episode? Not only did it put me off, it also ruined \u2018the flow\u2019 of the story.\\n\\n\r\nNext, characters. I hoped that the characters would be better than in most other shounen\u2026 but they weren\u2019t. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m still hoping for a shounen with strong female characters (and I don\u2019t mean strong like Mikasa from AoT, I mean strong like\u2026 actually well written). All the girls in this show were just plain stupid. I mean, is it that much of a hassle to make one girl smart? Just one, not all of them\u2026 one. Or to give a girl some kind of complex personality? I mean\u2026 I can round all of these characters up in just a few words, what means they\u2019re just shallow and didn\u2019t go through any development at all. First, we have Aqua, a arrogant, annoying, screaming, egocentric goddess. Next, we have Megumin, a girl who\u2026 loves explosions \u2013 that\u2019s really her only personality trait, if you can even call it that. And last, we have Darkness, who is a masochist that wants to protect people, I guess? I don\u2019t get why some people get invested in these characters, they\u2019re just stupid. \\n\\n\r\nWe also have Kazuma. Our main hero, who is a guy, so of course he does have a certain amount of intelligence. I mean, why would you give a girl some common sense, how is our hero going to save her if she\u2019s capable of saving herself? So, Kazuma has common sense, constantly complains about the stupid world he ended up in and he is annoyed with all those stupid girls surrounding him. Naturally, somewhere along the way he starts to care for them and they all become bff\u2019s. What I did like about Kazuma, is that he becomes stronger at a slow rate, much more believable than Aqua, who suddenly gets some epic tricks out of nowhere. \\n\\n\r\nAnd my last comment about the characters (somebody needs to say it): is every man in Konosuba a pervert? I mean, at the final episode, all of the men began to fight\u2026 only after they thought of their nights with the succubi? Is that really their only motivation? Even if they\u2019re just side characters\u2026 give them some substance please.\\n\r\nI understand that it is meant to be funny and not taken so seriously\u2026 but can we maybe have a funny show with some decent characters? They do exist, you know. We have for example My Hero Academia and Magi: they still manage to be funny even with some intelligent and complex female characters in the running.\\n\\n\r\nNow, over to sound\u2026 I did not like it, I did not dislike it. The opening was nothing more than mediocre. The ending\u2026 except for one time, I always skipped it, so it wasn\u2019t that good either. Sound effects were nothing special. Voice acting did fit the characters most of the time. It just really annoyed me when Aqua started screaming again \u2013 and again\u2026 and again.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not worth mentioning either\u2026\\n\\n\r\nSo... If your looking for something that has been done a thousand time before and you really enjoy watching some stupid girl with tons of fanservice... this is the show for you.",

            "content": "After watching this, i was wondering for about a year... Why is this series so popular? \"How\" did it become so popular? When it's one of the most generic and most boring anime that has been released in the last 10 years. From the overall story to the animation, everything seems traced from every other fantasy anime, with the turn that this has comedy in it, but of course, the comedy is nothing from the other world, just plain comedy, and most of the time, you already knew when a joke was coming and what it was about. \r\nThe whole selling point of this wasdying and going to another world of your choice (nothing new at this point, keep in mind that every one is doing it right now) but in this case is more of a game, rather than transporting to a \"fantasy world\". The comedy was sometimes fun, and other times bothersome by how repetitive it was, and for some reason, the MC screaming was somewhat funny for a selected group of people. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, all of this can't be done without animation, but i don't really know if this series needed the animation, in the first place, while it felt a bit on purpose, it was horrible. From the characters moving, to what you get from a kid playing around with clay, deformed and the proportions wouldn't make any sense, but again, for some reason it felt like it was deliberately made that way, even nowadays Hentai series get better animation (Talk about being generous).\\n\\n\r\nSound it is hard to criticize as most anime have good audio, but it felt like there was 0 effort from the studio on putting the BGM in correct places. The seiyuu were a good choice, but the mc screaming all the time, is not something pleasing for anyone's ears. \\n\r\nWhile character development was ok for everyone, it felt \"dry\" or dull for anyone other than the MC, it felt slow paced, like if the only one of interest was the main chara when obviously the most interesting characters were the females. \\n\\n\r\nCan't really explain my enjoyment for this, it was boring and predictable, while at some times they got me off guard, the animation was a main flaw that made me drop the number a lot, i wouldn't personally recommend this, but seeing how popular it is, most people would've heard of this already. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 1\\n\r\nArt: 1\\n\r\nSound: 3\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\r\nOverall: 2\\n\\n\r\nAs always i'm sorry for any grammar error.",

            "content": "This anime is great. At first glance, looking at the setting of guy surrounded by cute girls in a dungeon RPG fantasy, it makes you think of Shitty Art Online, or maybe that Dungeon-something anime with the big-boobed goddess. But this, this is not like those sad excuses for animes. It was actually enjoyable, it was funny, it was entertaining, and you will rarely cringe or get bored while watching it. Main thing is, this is primarily a comedy anime, so if you're looking for a serious anime then this is not the anime for you.\r\nThe characters were really great. A tsukkomi protagonist is accompaniedby a full team of wackos, each of which have really interesting and funny design, character, and personalities.\\n\\n\r\nThe story... Doesn't take itself seriously. And well, it doesn't have to, since it better this way for this comedy anime. The \"main\" goal is to defeat the Devil King and stuff, but for most of the anime they were just mostly dealing with toads and cabbages and goofy villains. But at least they have actual progress from being newbies and they aren't OP from the start unlike some other RPG-style anime.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding fanservice. OH GOD(dess) STOP SHOWING AQUA'S BARE BUTTOCKS ALL THE TIME. Seriously this is my main irk with this anime, they have a character who has a very short skirt and doesn't wear underwear, and they like to show it all the time. But oh well aside from that, it's not as bad as other anime. There are few other generic ecchi scenes such as panty stealing and taking a bath together (both of which are actually hilarious), and some characters wear very skimpily, but for the main cast, aside from Aqua, it's not too distracting and irritating to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is catchy and the ED is pretty great. The voice acting was on point with the characters and their quirky personalities.\\n\\n\r\nThe art leaves a lot to be desired, though. The designs of the most of the characters are good, but the animation sometimes fall flat and feel lazy and the faces occasionally look weird if you look closely. And the boobs. Fking hell if you want to include bouncing boobs at least make it look right. Aqua damn it.\\n\\n\r\nBut oh well. This anime is one to watch if you really want to laugh, if you want to see a quirky and entertaining main cast, if you're tired of all those other shitty RPG-based anime. It's short and has very little plot and mostly just comedy, but it's damn good at what it was mainly meant to do: make you laugh.",

            "content": "WELCOME TO KONOSUBA'S RIFT\r\nThis review will be rigged with League of Legends references. If you don't get it, you obviously need to start playing the game right now. And no there's no spoiler.\r\nKonosuba > DotA 2 *Grabs boobs*.\r\nAt a quick glance, Konosuba might be as average as any other RPG harem where the MC is Faker playing against a bunch of Crowns and Kuros, where all he has to do is perform a barrel roll on stage then proceed to win Worlds. Three times. \r\nWRONG. It's far from that yet it was so good that I would consider this anime to be THE anime ofthe season. How? (MF support duh)\\n\\n\r\nAfter 10 episodes directed by Mr. Michael Bay, our party of Bronze V garbage feeders still hasn't managed to get out of the ghetto ass town made for noobs and losers, let alone destroying the enemy Nexus. Basically, the plot moved SLOWER THAN THE FUCKING CLOCK WHEN I'M AT WORK. At the very least, they did manage to slay a super fed Mordekaiser (but he did nothing wrong ;_;), farm that clueless Tahm Kench over and over and survive a debacle of One-for-all Renekton gank.\\n\\n\r\n30 SECONDS UNTIL MAIN CHARACTERS SPAWN\\n\\n\r\nThe art was bright and colorful, reflecting the overall mellow mood. the background and water art were especially beautiful that they gave me eyegasm. The skin, textures and animation is fairly good, but at times they were sloppy like a bunch of chimpanzees were substituted in to take charge of production.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks and OP/ED songs were okay, fairly relaxing, mellow which captured the overall silly and light-hearted nature of the series but not that impressive (to me at least). It would've been better if the troll music from Random LoL Moments on Youtube were used. On the other hand, the voice acting was superb which greatly contributed to the comedy and overall enjoyment of the series. Kazuma's \"Hai, Kazuma desu\", Aqua's cries and rants were so hilarious I can't even.\\n\\n\r\nWhat made Konosuba highly enjoyable was the team of 5 totally dysfunctional, insufferable trash players and the comedy that resulted from their inability to cooperate, which led to their flaming one another and getting utterly raped by whatever's going on around them. Konosuba makes fun of the RPG genre and its cliches in general instead of following them, leaving a stronger impression on me, the viewer who's obviously tired of SAO, Log Horizons and such. Furthermore, no anime would be complete without this most fundamental rule: Cute girls. Konosuba's cast of girls (and Kazuma) were cute, yes, they're even highly distinctive and did not fall into apparent tropes that are so overused nowadays, making them relatively fresh.\\n\\n\r\n\"Baa.......kaaaa Ta...taaa......taric-kun, it's not like I wanted to go bot lane with you or anything... Don't misunderstand\" - Tsundere Ezreal.\\n\\n\r\n\"I'm sorry Lux-chan, I, Taric, Ezreal-tan's eternal lover will be the only one allowed to go bot lane with him\" *Swings hammer* - *Rainbow splatters* - Yandere Taric\\n\\n\r\nNo, no, we don't need any of that, get outta here.\\n\\n\r\nMAIN CHARACTERS HAVE SPAWNED\\n\\n\r\n- The adc: Satou Kazuma, leader, our hella weak dickwad of an adc compared to Jesus-kun of the RPG world Kirito, but he's got the brain and he actually fights smart despite his auto-flaming. His cynical and realist attitude separated him from our usual never-give-up nakama-powered MCs, which might as well make him the best MC of the season. He's the only adc to not dive into the middle of the enemy team, as rare as it sounds. He's surrounded by idiots and the way he deals with them is uber hilarious, reminds me of how I deal with my own League party. You did not realize that the adc is a melee, and you're not going to question it. Move on\\n\\n\r\nFIRST BLOOD\\n\\n\r\n- The Mid Laner, One Explosion Girl a.k.a Michael Bay's waifu: She's basically Ziggs but with only the Ult, thus she's literally useless after using it, requiring someone to carry her (literally and figuratively) else she'll feed the enemy team's Tahm Kench and Mordekaiser. She is, of course, flamed by Kazuma throughout the series. She's cute, yeah, but she's not like your average moeblob. She's got explosive personalities, explosive ambitions and explosive love for explosions. Hue\\n\\n\r\nENEMY DOUBLE KILL\\n\\n\r\n- The Top Laner, a.k.a MasoLeona: What's better than a tank? A MASOCHISTIC TANK!!!!!!! She's tankier than Rammus, Malphite, and Alistar w/ full tank build combined but her aim is worse than mine in the morning trying to piss while blinded by the Satan God Teemo (he's the real Demon King they have to kill). Needlessly to say, she joyously took all the aggro and flaming like a real M. Scenes where she verbally \"abused\" the honorable Dullahan were priceless. Poor Dully. If only she could aim her E properly... Who even plays Leona top nowadays? This is like fucking Dyrus trolling every game when he's streaming after having retired from TSM.\\n\\n\r\nENEMY TRIPLE KILL\\n\\n\r\n- The Support, Best Girl (sorry Michael Bay fans): Basically your toxic feeder Nami with legs building ap instead of support items while going around trash talking to people and fucking shit up with wataah. She's super derp, always trying to ragequit, feeds Tahm Kench furiously and is constantly flamed by Kazuma but that's where the fun comes from. She just needs a hug and I wanna give her a big hug so badly because she was forced to play support by Kazuma, it's not her fault guys!!!\\n\\n\r\nENEMY QUADRA KILL\\n\\n\r\n- The Jungler, Wizzlestick (because ap jungler w/ drain, but then again it's a contradiction because she is... well... thick, while Fiddlestick is... well... a stick): The one who is super fed but only came to gank like twice during the entire anime but who cares? She's kind and cute af, and she destroys the enemy when it matters most. Unfortunately the support absolutely hates her guts because she's not playing a meta champ, but this is the only time when not everyone blamed the jungler for their misery. If only she ganked lane more often, she'd be a best girl contender. Let's be honest that she's only here because I don't want to have a team of 4 when implementing League of Legends in my review.\\n\\n\r\nENEMY PENTAKILL\\n\\n\r\nEveryone is 1/10 fed and 9/10 feeder, however due to the circumstances they have to stick together because 4 is always better than 1 (5 if the Jungler actually showed up). This is where Konosuba is most different and in a good way, the characters slowly get stronger, better at teamwork, more sympathetic and understanding of one another over, (still weak in the end), not shitting out powers and eternal bonds of friendship all of a sudden. Nobody gets ult from Level 1 guys...\\n\\n\r\nOUR TURRET HAS BEEN DESTROYED\\n\\n\r\nI could relate to Kazuma so well, being a decent League player who prefers to stick to a group of average feeders and make them better, rather than joining a bunch of diamonds because then victory doesn't feels like a true accomplishment, and there's no fun curb-stomping the enemy team all the time. Believe me, I raged hard the night I wrote this review because we played like retards lol.\\n\\n\r\nOUR INHIBITOR HAS BEEN DESTROYED\\n\\n\r\nAfter successfully defending the base from Super Siege Minion spawned by Warlord's Banner of Command, our gang must head into the counteroffensive to be brought by season 2. But until then, let's just say that season 1 was exhilarating to watch. I especially appreciated the silly comedy, the anti-harem and anti-OP MC themes from the series.\\n\\n\r\nMichael Bay would be so proud of Megumin and Konosuba, someone needs to show him this series please.\\n\\n\r\nDEFEAT.... barely avoided.",

            "content": "Konosuba is an anime that I initially thought was going to be great. I mean, it had awesome character design, and it was funny! Well... as you can probably see by the score, my opinion changed pretty quickly. In my opinion, at least 90% of comedy anime are destined for failure, because not everyone is going to find them funny. This one is no exception.\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\r\nSTORY: 2/10\r\nI'm pretty sure everybody has said this already, but, it really is true. After the extreme success of Sword Art Online the reality to game genre has become an insanely overused trope. Konosuba does have one thing going for itthough... Instead of choosing to become ridiculously powerful like almost every other protagonist, this protagonist decides to take the wish granter with him to the 'subarashi sekai'. I can tell you, I wasn't expecting that!\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nART: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art itself in Konosuba... is bad. Really bad. As in, it looks way too old for 2016 quality. It could have been worse, MUCH worse, but it is by no means impressive. What is impressive however, is the animation, especially in episode 10, with all those explosion scenes. Radiant colors flaring everywhere, shapes of all different sizes, but most importantly, in the episodes with the succibi and in the mansion..... HOLY CRAP DID YOU SEE THOSE JIGGLE PHYSICS?!\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nSOUND: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nUgh... well, here goes. Konosuba's sound factor. The opening theme is very catchy. But not the kind of way that makes you want to sing it all the time, the kind that makes you regret ever haring it because you can't stop singing it. The ending theme as well, is just plain and not something anyone will remember. I did like how some characters got themes to match their personalities, but even then the music was mediocre at best. The voice acting is done decently, but is nothing special. The sound effects were also average.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm actually scared to be writing this right now, because the amount of butthurt fanboys is going to be insane. But, here goes... I'll start off with character design. Unrecognizable. Every. Single. One of 'em. They have the traditional 'fantasy world' clothing and design, through and through. As for their personalities: Kazuma is a funny lead that tries to defy the harem cliches. Aqua is funny as well, and memorable for sure, but she is outshined by Darkness, a masochist. Yep. You heard me. A masochist. Hilarious! And of couuuurse, how could I forget fan favorite Megumin! Super cute and always unleashing explosions, what is NOT to love about these characters?!....... They aren't funny anymore. Usually unique characters being fit into a 10 episode anime like this are praised and loved by all, because there isn't enough time to realize the flaws in the character. (I'm guilty of this also). That's not the case with Konosuba. I think it was around episode 7 when I stopped laughing because I had heard the same jokes over and over again. By episode 10, they were straight up annoying.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nOVERALL: 3.75/10\\n\\n\r\nKonosuba... ok, I'm not even going to say it had potential, because it didn't. It was doomed to fail from the start. If you consider this anime funny it is definitely something to try, but if not, don't bother. I would only recommend it to extreme fans of the reality to game genre, and.... well... that's it. If you enjoy it, good for you! As for me, Konosuba was not my cup of tea.",

            "content": "(6.5/10) - If you are curious about the point system I use to grade shows, check my profile for more information. \r\n______________________________________________________________\r\nKonosuba is most likely the last anime i'll be watching this summer. In a way, that makes me happy. Its a very light-hearted and breezy show that I honestly don't want to critique too heavily. At its core, its just so likable and easy to watch. However, I wouldn't be a hardass if I didn't tear up a likable show like this every so often, so lets get into it. \r\nMuch like this show, i'll keep this review breezy and to-the-point. But not beforeI explain the concept of comedy. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe very base idea of a joke is something that makes someone laugh. Something told through a story with a funny punchline that subverts expectations and causes a response of happiness. Put simply, this is exactly what a joke should be. \\n\\n\r\nJokes and comedy in general live on unexpectedness. Something called \"subversion.\" If you think back to any funny joke, the punchline is always there to subvert some sort of expectation. Whether its making something dirtier than you originally thought, or stupider, or more random, or darker, everything in humor is there to be unexpected at its core.\\n\\n\r\nI won't delve into ironic humor which is obviously become so big recently. But that's it. To prove my point I typed in \"Funny jokes\" on google and the first website I went on was titled Jokes.cc.com. \\n\\n\r\nI clicked the first tab I saw and the first joke I saw and what I read the following : \\n\\n\r\nA grasshopper walks into a bar, and the bartender says, \"Hey, we have a drink named after you!\"\\n\r\nThe grasshopper looks surprised and asks, \"You have a drink named Steve?\"\\n\\n\r\nIs it a good joke? Well, maybe not. Its a very overdone joke at this point, but it follows every format that a joke does. It had a setup, a delivery, a punchline, and a subversion of expectations with that punchline. You expect a grasshopper not to have a name but man, his name is STEVE! Fucking hilarious! Or, at least it was at some point. \\n\\n\r\nSo the more we see a similar setup and delivery, the more unfunny a joke becomes. The less you get surprised when the punchline has an animal saying his name is \"Steve\". That subversion element is gone and the joke is no longer funny. It becomes a cliche.\\n\\n\r\nBut still, I see so much television out there that strives on comedic cliches in bad and good ways. In a bad way, there is television out there just checking off a checklist of \"cliche humor that is sure to make someone laugh\", and then in a good way, there are shows out there that use cliche humor AS the setup to a more clever or ironic punchline. \\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind, i'll get into Konosuba. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[PART 1] : The theme\\n\\n\r\nThis is a fun little show. I won't waste your time by giving you a plot synopsis, but at its core its a show about a dysfunctional group of people trying to live in a fantasy world. I automatically recommend it for two kinds of people. Avid MMO players as well as just fans of anime. \\n\\n\r\nIts at its funniest when it does clever (and occasionally not-so-clever) nods to the idea of being a show about a party in an MMO. \\n\\n\r\nA tank who's a horndoggo masochist. \\n\\n\r\nA healer who's a weakling and a coward. \\n\\n\r\nA glass-cannon DPS who's out of mana after one spell. \\n\\n\r\nThe party-leader who's useless in combat. \\n\\n\r\nIts a funny concept in itself and it lends well to subvert a lot of expectations that anime has. Especially with the boom of MMO anime like Sword Art Online, RE:Zero, etc. Its always nice to see the piss being taken out of a really popular cliche. \\n\\n\r\nI just wish Konosuba actually did that more. I felt like this concept was often a bit too hidden or even underutilized. A lot of scenes were simply cliche and not a funny twist on the cliche. Mind you, I don't find pointing out that this a cliche and still doing it with a straight face is any different that just doing the cliche and moving on. If anything, it drags it out. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is occasionally self-aware and occasionally not. That's what makes the tonal shifts in a few episodes so jarring. We have a lot of self-awareness in the final episode of the season and then literally none in the episode before. This makes the author of the Light Novel feel as though he's cherry picking the things he wants to make fun of. If anything, the reason this show falls a little short in execution is because the author isn't willing to to go \"whole hog\" with the concept. \\n\\n\r\nIts like he's laughing at one thing because he thinks its stupid and then doing another, equally dumb, cliche with a straight face. It comes off as though he's not creative enough to think of something else in place of that cliche. Or if anything, do it with the same self-awareness. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[PART 2] : Art \\n\\n\\n\r\nAfter I finished the show I read a little about the response it got. The show received a mostly positive response, however, I see a lot of people criticizing its art. Personally, I didn't find it any worse than a lot of anime I've seen. In fact, it did a few things better. \\n\\n\r\nI'll gladly take simpler designs with enhanced animation over complex designs over literally just still images (looking at you ever Shounen-action show ever). \\n\\n\r\nSo this shows actual animation was fairly solid throughout. It was unclean, sure, but honestly that kind of added to the charm of the whole thing. I liked that these characters didn't feel like a perfect-looking flawed bunch. They are a flawed-looking flawed-bunch, which fits.\\n\\n\r\nWhether this was done on purpose or not doesn't matter to me. I'm going to give Studio Deen the benefit of the doubt here. Where this show is also a bit hit-or-miss with is the character designs.\\n\\n\r\nWe get a generic looking protagonist with Kazuma, who gets elevated by VA Jun Fukushima's voice work, which is often times deadpan and the highlight of the show, comedy wise. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters are also fairly uninspired looking. From the goddess, Aqua, and her \"seen her before\" look of \"anime goddess\". To a few of the locals having the whole \"same-face\" treatment. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, the show stands out with its design of Darkness, the crusader tank of the group who's armor looks pretty great. As well as the adorable Loli mage Megumin who quickly skyrocketed to my favorite character in the entire show. Her design is the shows most unique (and cute) as well as a pretty nice performance by her VA, Rie Takahashi, who from the looks of it is newer to voice acting than the others in the show. \\n\\n\r\nSo the design is a mixed bag that's elevated by the entire style of the show. I'm also a complete sucker for fantasy, as its my favorite genre. So everything from the quaint starting town to the grass-swept hills are things that I look at extremely fondly. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[PART 3] : Sound\\n\\n\\n\r\nI'll keep it short. The sound design in the show is OK. It seems to be using the same effects as most other shows in similar environments use. This is fine, to be honest. I'm not expecting some crazy level of detail in the sound design. Apart from the cool popping noises we get from Megumin's magic, and the magic itself looking pretty cool, its generally run-of-the-mill.\\n\\n\r\nThe intro song is also fairly forgettable, to be honest. There's really nothing about it that's memorable and it plays as every other Shounen opening does. Its loud, poppy, and features scenes of the characters looking at the camera or at each other. \\n\\n\r\nWhere this show REALLY excels in sound is the credits song, which is fucking. AMAZING. It might actually be my favorite song I've heard an anime produce, ever. Its really really good and I found myself constantly just listening to the entire credits track, which is something I've never done before.\\n\\n\r\nIt honestly perfectly encapsulates the starting zone feel in MMO's. It has this soothing, catchy, and memorable quality about it. It also reincorporates the shows title in it. Its perfect and I wish i heard more of it as I believe that in the second season when they inevitably leave the starting area, the song won't be used. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[PART 4] : Comedy\\n\\n\\n\r\nInevitably, lets talk about comedy. I touched a little on it in the first part, but lets get into it fully. This show is a action-comedy show which means that the comedy is equally, if not the biggest element in the show. Its also the first action-comedy anime I've seen. Even if a lot of the action Shounen that I've seen did have comedy elements. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is very \"anime\" with its comedy. I hope that doesn't sound offensive, but every single anime i've seen approaches comedy in a very similar way. For some reason, and I cannot for the life of me place it, maybe its cultural or something, anime has this necessity of making a joke TOO obvious. It makes the joke right in your face. It suffocates you with it. Every reaction is usually overdone and HUGE. \\n\\n\r\nThis is great for some people, especially people who love unsubtle slapstick. But for someone like me who finds comedy to be the funniest when its subtle, it falls flat more times than one. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough this show does do some funny facial expressions as well as cuts the music for some deadpan delivery, which actually did get a few chuckles from me, it often feels as though its too deep in its \"roots\" to try and create anything subtle about any of its delivery. \\n\\n\r\nThe only actor who really nails it with the concept of \"subtle\" is our protagonists VA. I don't think I've ever called the protagonist of an anime its \"best\" part, but honestly, Kazuma wrung the most laughs from me. He plays the deadpan to the other characters crazy, which makes him a funny foil a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also has a tendency to drag its very obvious setups and jokes on. A panty-stealing scene is forgivable as it helps establish our protagonists knack for the 'steal' spell. But a bathing scene that goes from chuckle-worthy eye-roll-inducing cliche to \"please this is just getting stupid\" is the show cutting it a bit too long. \\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate my point about comedy way above in the start of the review. The writer needs to realize that adept watchers who watch a lot of television pin-point cliches from a mile away. Just because you point out certain cliches doesn't make the cliches you do any more forgivable. If anything, it makes them LESS forgivable. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn a show that's bases is its interactions between characters, i'm also sad to say that these interactions become a bit stale. Especially the relationship between Kazuma and the goddess Aqua, which becomes repetitive by episode five.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully romance is never really introduced into this harem-esq show as that would spoil any amount of fun I was having. It just doesn't need shit like that. Especially since these characters talking is so one-note a lot of the time. \\n\\n\r\nThe only scenes which honestly don't have semi-cliche and repetitive dialogue are the scenes with Kazuma and the best character, Megumin. Their scenes feel more natural and as though they actually have a friendship, instead of darting from \"caring about these people \" to \"hating their guts\", like our protagonist does so often. \\n\\n\r\nThis impacts the shows development. Which a comedy show doesn't necessarily NEED to have, but if it prompts not to have development, it NEEDS to have a solid base of characters. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\\n\r\nShows like Rick and Morty, Community, Parks and Recreations, The Office, Arrested Development, all have character development and progression. \\n\\n\r\nWhile shows like Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia do not. So how does Always Sunny stay fresh? Well the base characters that we were introduced to had a various amount of personality to them. They came stock with so much personality that the show can ring eleven, ten episode long seasons from them and it still feel fresh. The show is still going onto its twelfth too. \\n\\n\r\nSo where Konosuba should really focus next season is on making sure these characters don't feel as one note. Not every dialogue scene has to end with Aqua and Kazuma yelling at each other. Not every scene has to end with Darkness being awkwardly sexual. Its just not necessary since those parts of the characters are already established.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like the joke about the grasshopper named Steve has become old and overused, these characters interactions became somewhat of a drag midway through this shows VERY short season! \\n\\n\r\nThis is only emphasized by the messy introduction of a lot of background characters that fill up the show. From Kazuma's two friends that get randomly introduced in episode nine to the lich Wiz, who all feel like stories cut from the Light Novel that were still included in the show. \\n\\n\r\nIts more than a bit messy. \\n\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion] : \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo I don't find it THAT funny, I find the base concept generic, I think it misses a lot of opportunities to comment on MMO's, it cherry picks too often on what it wants to be meta about... why does this show have a 6.5/10? Which is by all means an above average score!\\n\\n\r\nWell, as I said early in the review, its likable. If I wasn't laughing at certain scenes and jokes, I had a little grin on my face. It was a fun little show to watch and I found myself thankful that it only had ten episodes. These ten episodes were a bit messy, much like the animation and dialogue, but they were endearing if anything. \\n\\n\r\nEverything from the montage in the third episode of Megumin and Kazuma blowing shit up to the way the shows slice-of-life feel is formatted with quests these characters need to complete. \\n\\n\r\nAnd these quests were the shows more entertaining aspects because I know many people including myself have had these experiences with players in an MMO before. The hilarious incompetence is something we look fondly back on. I only wish this show focused more on that. Its most laugh-out-loud moments came from quests as well as the events that came about because of those quests.\\n\\n\r\nMost specifically the entire string between episode two and three, where a quest involving giant frogs leads to some pretty damn funny results. These results are what build this shows undoubtedly large heart. \\n\\n\r\nI think it wrongfully thinks that its heart comes from emotional scenes that it sparingly includes in its run-time. No. Its heart comes from everything but that. Its the working for money. The questing and getting overrun by mobs. The high-level player encounter. Its all what makes MMO so memorable. \\n\\n\r\nI hope the show doesn't lose that feel when the second season airs next year. I hope it keeps that and doesn't instead go into its own more focused story. Have them move around doing higher level quests, gear up, and just work together. From that there could be ample time to develop these characters more.\\n\\n\r\nI get that their point is that their all just a dumb bunch of shlubs, but if they aren't going for an Always Sunny in Philadelphia level of unlikable douchebaggery, then the author shouldn't be hesitant to give them a better relationship with each other. \\n\\n\r\nI give this show a lot of merit because for everything that it does wrong or messily it makes up for in memory and heart. For every joke that falls flat on its ass and every prolonged scene of awkward and not very well done fan-service, the shows more relaxed moments are what kept me watching in the end. \\n\\n\r\nThis brings me back to the end-credit song of the show. That songs perfectly explains the feelings this show occasionally delivered. That's what I want to see more of. Not another scene of Aqua being bitchy or Darkness having giant jiggly tits. Let the comedy come naturally through the flow of events that a lot of people can relate to. \\n\\n\r\nLet the breezy heart of the show take you away into the world.",

            "content": "MAKE WAY FOR THE ACTUAL BEST SHOW OF WINTER 2016!!!\r\nKonoSuba spews out pure joys and rainbows. With other shows telling great stories or exploring philosophy and other themes, Konosuba ignores all that and focuses on pure entertainment! With genuinely hilarious albeit niche comedy, any flaws this series has are just parodied to still become enjoyable. There's very little to criticize about this show, because I'm not even sure whether or not all of these \"flaws\" it has are there on purpose or not.\r\nKonoSuba is the obligatory goofball of its season. It's so over the top, but it manages to execute its quirkiness in a waythat's super hilarious and lighthearted. Instead of pursuing a serious story, it focuses on slice of life shenanigans that make fun of stereotypes, like character tropes and MMO characteristics. KonoSuba is an amazing anime to just sit down and relax to. Other shows getting on your nerves with their turtle or cheetah pacing? Pop an episode of KonoSuba. Feeling down because you just finished an amazing show, and you have fallen into a showhole? KonoSuba will cheer you up with its refreshing comedy, and it will get you back into an anime watching mood in no time! \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Cast of characters are funny and resemble other awesome characters.\\n\r\n- Parody references of MMO mechanics are creative, funny, and now that you think about it, MMOs make no sense at all!\\n\r\n- For a silly series, the animation and art is gorgeous and the soundtrack is awesome too! The ED especially has a Fairy Tail feel.\\n\r\n- Just pure joy comes out of watching this.\\n\r\n- MY CABBAGES!!!!\\n\r\n- The show is so cliche that it's anti-cliche.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- There is very little relevant plot.\\n\r\n- Only 10 episodes. Really? Are you kidding?\\n\r\n- Has promises of going somewhere yet never does.\\n\r\n- Since characters are parodies, they don't have much character of their own and aren't very unique.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nDespite the fact that there is almost no actual story, and that it's more like a slice of life of a stereotypical MMORPG world, the little events that happen are creative and enjoyable, especially to you hardcore MMORPG gamers out there. Konosuba's first episode is actually one of the better first episodes in the medium, as it tells you exactly what you're getting yourself into. The show parodies the mechanics of MMO games to the point of boner inducing laughs, such as highlighting the outrageousness of what MMO skills can do, as well as the randomness and weirdness of MMO events and quests. It also parodies anime by using subtle 4th wall breaks in reaction to what the characters say or do. The show is a parody and the characters know it. Konosuba has this quirk of doing something so stupidly outrageous that you can't even get mad at it. This show is incredibly self aware of its silliness, and as a result, takes it even higher.\\n\\n\r\nKonosuba has this thing it likes to do, and that's bring everything full circle for the laughs. And when I say full circle, I mean literally full circle, as in by the end of all the outrageous things happening, the story hasn't progressed a single step. Even so, there is a sense of a growing bond, perhaps an unhealthy bond but a bond for sure, between the characters, and this is definitely something that progresses throughout the series. Unfortunately, this developing bond leaves the story in the dust. Konosuba is like parkour: it takes the most insane and outrageous route to get to where it wants to go, except it doesn't go anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nEven silly anime have high budget art and animation, and KonoSuba is proof of that. The animation is actually really gorgeous (for example, the animation of the DNA strands are actually pretty cool!) The characters look like shit but for all the right reasons, Aqua's design highlights her adorableness and cynical nature. The other characters also have fitting designs for their characteristics, and have some little resemblances to other characters that they could possibly be based off of. However, this is Deen we are talking about, so it never keeps this quality of animation, and it lowers in quality constantly. KonoSuba is one of those shows that actually benefits from its shitty art at times, and the really poorly drawn faces make me laugh that much harder. In fact, I was under the impression that Deen was making fun of their own shitty animation with this series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe OP is catchy and the ED is amazing. The OST is pretty good, but the main highlight is the Voice Acting. The seiyuus match their characters amazingly, each line being executed with passion and energy. I wouldn't know for sure, but it sounded like the seiyuus were having a blast. The execution of the punch lines hit home every time. This show is a very loud show, characters are constantly screaming at each other and laughing in distorted ways, and I'm sure it's tough for the seiyuus' voices. When it comes to comedy, the jokes are only as funny as how funny it is told, and in this case, it was told well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nThis cast is so outrageous, they essentially make the show. Each character parodies a stereotype, and they do it very well. The MC, Kazuma, is the smart but talentless trope who is the only sane one around, and whenever his mindset matches the viewer, which happened a decent amount with me, it made the situations comedy gold. Aqua parodies the dumb but full of potential clumsy character, Megumin is the chuunibyou trope (except not really cause her powers are real) and has a lot of confidence. And of course, Darkness is the obligatory perverted masochist! They take their tropes as far as they can go, and it makes this show that much funnier.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, gimmicks like these can only go so far. The real value behind these characters are their interactions. These days, character interactions are the base of comedy anime and if the interactions seem unnatural or forced, the jokes can only be so funny. In Konosuba, not only are the interactions very natural and flow well, but they are so god damn unpredictable. Despite the apparently clear cut tropes these characters follow, the interactions end up being stuff you wouldn't expect. Timing and predictability play as important of a role as the quality of the joke itself, and the cast of Konosuba goes out of their way to execute jokes perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThis show is incredibly refreshing and, most importantly, holds a lot of rewatch value! It's a good example of a show that is good and feels good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nThis show is so fun to watch. If you want a show were you don't have to think about anything and you can just sit and enjoy whatever is thrown at you, this show's gotchu! Of course, many watch anime expecting a plot that actually goes somewhere, and Konosuba is definitely not going anywhere, but I implore that you at least give it a shot.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Take out all the flaws of SAO and replace it with comedy, and you get this show!\\n\\n\r\nHERE IS TO A GLORIOUS AND OUTRAGEOUS SEASON 2!!!\\n",

            "content": "The influx of MMO themed anime in the recent years may have viewers disheartened by the fact that mostly those share very similar premises and are executed for the most part in similar ways without any significant difference. Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!, or Konosuba in short, is yet another such anime, yet with an interesting twist: it actually takes a comedic stance on its themes, as well as characters, which is great to see in the sea of MMO-type of anime. In fact, it could be seen as a parody of the genre. However, as enjoyable as the anime was, it suffers fromvarious issues, the main one being its aimless demeanor after reaching its peak in the first half.\\n\\n\r\n~Story~\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Konosuba is focused around Kazuma Satou who just casually dies on the most average day of his life, and in the most unheroic way at that. When he reawakens in the afterlife, he is given the choice to either go to heaven or defeat the Demon King, and goes for the latter - not after he appoints the arrogant Godess Aqua to join him in his journey. With both personalities being quite different, the one being pessimistic, while the other arrogant, hilarity ensures. This is further backed by the comedic approach on its themes and story, which for some may be hit or miss.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of defeating a demon lord has been explored an innumerable amount of times, yet this anime manages to incorporate genuine hilarious elements such as parodies directly to some MMORPG game mechanics (useless skills, grinding, you name it) or the several anime troupes within the genre itself. It is actually hilarious to see. A thing that stands out in the anime is the sense of authenticity of the character's progression: by repeating several actions that represent the \"grind\" in a game, these convey to audiences a continuous, yet wide-spanning timeline, in which the characters relationships develop, besides of displaying the little details of the world they live in. Concerning the pacing of this work, it is well executed, keeping viewers for most of its duration interested by not prolonging any scene or event longer than necessary, which mostly applies to the flow events as well. Characters are introduced through the various mechanics of the world in a satisfying manner, which is an added bonus.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as positive as it may sound, the anime sadly suffers from progression issues after the first half. The first five episodes are dedicated to a introducing the main characters and their hardships, as well as introducing the various secondary characters; with of course hilarious scenes and jokes. Furthermore, progression was made to reach their ultimate goal, the defeat of the Demon King, which kept the story interesting. However, the anime settles itself with little to no progression on the last part, in addition to jokes getting old, and at times just lacking. This is further noticeable with various characters that are abruptly introduced and then left forgotten, with a heavy increase in fanservice in an episode that kind of broke with the immersion of this piece. Naturally, the short duration of the series may have had an impact on the aforementioned problems.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\\n\r\nComedy can never be as good without its characters: Konosuba did actually a great job on this department, albeit admittingly being a bit shallow at times. The different personalities of the cast further enhanced the comedic aspect of the series, which could have gone wrong when treated wrongly. Character development is nihil in this show, but was easily forgiven as it was not its focus. The interactions between the cast are well executed, despite their opposing personalities: this is tackled by the situation they find themselves in, in which they are forced together due to their circumstances. In fact, they're for most part actually just plain dumb or average. Some supporting characters are introduced, but for the most part felt rather lacking, as these were either introduced and forgotten, or the main characters came in contact with them, but that happened off-screen.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist Kazuma is where the show is centered about, and quite honestly, the driving force behind the whole show. His cynical and pessimistic personality on life really adds to the overall enjoyment of the series, as he is quite the opposite of your typical protagonist: furthermore, it is quite hilarious to see his interactions with his peers. Then there is Aqua that, despite being a Goddess, is quite arrogant and self-absorbed, it is quickly apparent she is quite the useless person, further mocking the \"goddess\" title. Some character development could be appreciated due to various events, yet was sufficient to feel authentic. Other characters of importance are Megumin, the archmage chuunibyou with am obsession about demon magic, or the masochistic crusader Darkness, who admittingly got a bit annoying by the end of the show. \\n\\n\r\n~Animation and sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality of Konosuba was as a whole average, yet certainly sufficient without breaking immersion in the story. What must be mentioned are the animations on the boobs of the female cast: these varied immensely, going from either saggy to upright. This might have been on purpose, yet why is unclear. As for the art style, it was at first glance rather lacking, yet as the anime progressed, it became apparent that this particular art style worked in its favour: especially when the facial expression are concerned. This matched magnificently with the various situations, personalities and atmosphere it was trying to convey.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Konosuba complemented with the comedic nature of the anime, although being either generic, or just forgettable. The opening and ending themes matched as well, yet, once again, were average. However, the selection of voice actors for the different characters were certainly very well done, matching with the different tones and personalities of the cast.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nOverall Konosuba was a title that came as a very pleasant surprise this season: in fact, I wouldn't have started it were it not for the recommendation of a user. The anime uses a template that has been recycled greatly, yet does it with a parodying stance on the MMO genre: this was further enhanced by its cast of character and voice actors. Despite all of this, it sadly suffered from an aimless demeanor in its last half, which was disappointing, albeit having some amusing moments. Regardless of said issues, I can't deny I enjoyed it, and I will be awaiting for the second season of Konosuba that has been announced. I truly hope it expands on its premise and progresses on it in the second season. This is a type of anime that can be either hilarious to some, or just plain bad for others, so depending on what you have read, it may be something for you.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "Ah Konosuba! \r\nI have a confession to make. When watching a show of the fantasy genre, I\u2019d often try to picture myself as the protagonist. In this series, it\u2019s almost impossible for me to do with a guy like Kazuma. Why? Because he\u2019s stuck with three characters who are all troublesome in their own ways and that\u2019s something I\u2019d find a hard time dealing with. Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo (also known as Konosuba!) is a show based on the light novel that\u2019s a bit unusual for a fantasy story.\r\nOn paper, the show feels like the generic type of stuff we see based onlight novel adaptations. Kazuma is a hikikomori and he ends up dead after trying to save a girl. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve probably heard of this a million times before. Soon, he encounters Aqua, a goddess and is given a chance to be reincarnated in his current body with memories and apparently mission to defeat the Demon King. The first episode quickly establishes the essence of the story and it\u2019s pretty straightforward. That is..until you realize the show is seemingly a parody of itself. \\n\\n\r\nEvery episode, there are segments when the characters are self-aware about their surroundings. If you don\u2019t believe me, just ask Kazuma. As a guy with a vast knowledge about otaku culture, there\u2019s no question that the show often makes fun of him. The interactions and relationships he forges with others is also mostly comedic. Kazuma and Aqua\u2019s relationship stands out as the idiot duo. It\u2019s pretty easy to see that they aren\u2019t very compatible especially with Kazuma\u2019s self-interests. In essence, he isn\u2019t a hero that fights for others but mostly for himself. In the meantime, Aqua is often useless with her skills and low intelligence despite having the status of a Goddess. Often or not, the two shares a relationship that stands along the firm line of \u201ctwo people basically forced to cooperate with each other\u201d. It doesn\u2019t stop there though. Megumin, a mage with chunnibyou-like personality and Darkness, a masochist knight also joins them on the quest. Together, they make up the Adventurer\u2019s Guild.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who are familiar with Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai, Megumin will probably feel similar to the character, Rika. Her over exaggerated speeches and chuunibyou behavior are the highlights of her character. And adding to her arsenal of tricks, she\u2019s got explosive magic which apparently has a limit before she collapses in comedic fashion. Then, there\u2019s Darkness. She\u2019s both an honorable knight and masochist. Yeah, you heard that right. For some peculiar reason, the show also makes her look like a jobber as she often misses her attacks in comedic fashion. When examining these two characters, it\u2019s easy to say that the party is doomed to fail. How are they supposed to defeat the Demon King with this pool of talent? The answer might be Kazuma but his thieving skills doesn\u2019t help much either except for stripping others of their panties. Nonetheless, the show makes it clear that the quest isn\u2019t meant to be taken seriously. Each episode divides segments in their fantasy world and show what Kazuma\u2019s party is capable of. Unfortunately for them, it often ends up with disastrous moments like being swallowed by oversized toads, being assaulted by armies of cabbages, trapped by alligators, etc. You get the general idea. In retrospect, the show is self-aware of its intentions and almost makes us pity the protagonists for their pathetic worthiness.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, that\u2019s what actually makes the series stand out as enjoyable. It\u2019s fun with all the comedic factors with Darkness\u2019 machoism or Aqua being useless during their adventure. Kazuma\u2019s character is more of a deconstruction of the hero trope and his death is even portrayed as a parody. And while it seems like he may have a \u201charem\u201d, there\u2019s actually a lot more emphasis on Kazuma trying to escape from the trio. However, there\u2019s development in their connection as well. While the girls sees him as a useless leader of the group, they do trust him more and more throughout the show. Similarly, Kazuma does begin rely on his party more as times goes on. However, their quest results are often pretty predictable where they manage to defeat the boss, but not without getting a lot of humiliation in between.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, this show will probably be a hit or miss for the audience. It will really depend on how you take in the humor as the show sells its comedy. At times, it\u2019s genuinely funny while other times may feel like it\u2019s forced down our throats. However, I\u2019d say that the show handled its comedy aspects right. The protagonists may feel irritating to watch but also very entertaining because of how much they fail. It\u2019s subverted to the point where we have to wonder if they are legitimate adventurers. As a fantasy-adventure show, it\u2019s also interesting to see how far it extends its concepts. It follows a lot of standards like game currency, completing quests, guilds, and fighting bosses. Just don\u2019t take the show seriously because of the quests themselves are more of a joke than anything else. It\u2019s still a legitimate fantasy series but unlike some fantasy shows such as Hai to Grimgar, it\u2019s all about more having fun rather than surviving.\\n\r\nOn the lesser fun note, the artwork is a really downside produced by studio DEEN. The previews weren\u2019t impressive so I had low expectations from the start. After watching the series, my mind didn\u2019t change much in terms of technical visuals. The characters look like they are cut from a potato with minimal effort. There\u2019s not much details poured into the characters besides the character designs (minus Kazuma as he always looks dull). Backgrounds looks moderate although convincing for the fantasy setting while the action is more or less exciting. Oh and of course, there\u2019s some fan service. From suggestive camera angles to masochism, it\u2019s there.\\n\\n\r\nWhen examining the soundtrack, it\u2019s actually fairly well done. While the OP and ED theme songs aren\u2019t spectacular, it\u2019s constructed with a clear amount of fantasy details and highlights of the main protagonists. The show also retains a lighthearted OST soundtrack because the series really isn\u2019t meant to be taken seriously. And finally, I have to give some praise to the main characters\u2019 voice acting. All of the characters are fun to watch by voice talent as they are able to sell their comedic expressions. From character interactions to fighting against bosses, it\u2019s quite entertaining to see how they react during near-death moments. Oh and who can forget about Darkness\u2019 masochistic behavior?\\n\\n\r\nThis show is actually surprising. That is, it\u2019s surprising at how the idea of \u2018being trapped in a fantasy world\u2019 can be so much fun. From the endless parodies, self-awareness, and character expressions, it\u2019s easy to say that Konosuba is more than just about completing quests. This is probably going to be a deciding factor for most viewers as the comedy will not appeal to everyone. It sometimes can feel too forced or repetitive. Also, it doesn\u2019t help with the minimal amount of characterization as the show itself makes fun of its character cast. The art department also seems to put poor effort into constructing the series as a whole. However, I\u2019d still advise giving Konosuba a try. It took me a little time to get used to the comedy as well but in the end, there\u2019s more to it than meets the eye.\\n\\n\r\nOh and Season 2 was announced today. Here we go again (soon)!\\n",

No. Does it do anything slightly original? NOO.\r\nIs it funny? That depends.\r\nThe story, setting and characters are largely irrelevant for a comedy show, and like all comedy shows Konosuba lives and dies on whether it is funny or not. To me it's not funny, Konosuba follows similar humor of Baka test, ie. addressing tropes of harem fantasy genre. But for me, this genre is already way too cancerous to be funny, and the jokes are things that had been done before andbetter. \\n\\n\r\nMost of all, I compare all fantasy work that have a high female ratio to Touhou, and ask myself, does this do anything Touhou hasn't done in the last two decades, and if not, why aren't I watching Touhou?\\n\\n\r\nIts kind of obvious that Konosuba fails on this front.\\n\\n\r\nGoddess with no charisma? Touhou.\\n\\n\r\nFantasy world joking around? Touhou.\\n\\n\r\netc. \\n\\n\r\nAnd as a result, Konosuba have no reason to exist, plus it is a LN adaptation, which I am very critical of, because the LN industry can't afford to let its standard sink any lower.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4, pretty worthless\\n",

            "content": "There goes KonoSuba! What an hell of a ride it has been!\r\nHonestly, at first glance Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! (God's Blessings on this Wonderful World!) or simply put as KonoSuba, feels nothing groundbreaking in a sense that its set in an RPG world, with the protagonist being a hardcore gamer and a shut-in, and on top of that its supposed to be a parody and a light comedy show. This is where it proves all the odds wrong by throwing a totally absurd, non-sensical whack job that forces the viewer to shut all his reasonings for a moment and simply sit back andtake a piece of what's on offer. KonoSuba is one of those rare shows that is legitimately funny, and actually make you laugh with dialogues that are supposed to. What makes this show just brilliant is that its not a try-hard at whatever it does, but simply offers you what its genuinely good at, and that is to make the viewer piss his pants by laughing. \\n\\n\r\nLike how laudable is that for a show, that dares to mix in all the elements and different genres, to go on and satisfy our needs to the fullest? You have a setting in an imaginary world inside like that of an RPG, you have cute moe girls that are set up with our supposedly miserable MC which creates a harem, and an endless amount of fanservice on offer. With all that added up, KonoSuba still manages to feed every category and does it without ever holding back. Now I said that the MC is supposed to be a loser who's a shut-in and obsessed with games, but in all fairness I will say that he's one of the coolest fellows I've ever seen gracing an anime. Kazuma Satou is his identification and he DIES within a minute of episode 1. Don't worry, its not a certain popular shounen anime of the past, but a start to this extraordinary and at the same time silly adventure he's going to take part in. So as he dies, he's sent to an unexisting void where he meets a cocky Goddess, that tells him to make one of the two choices given to him to in order to decide what his afterlife would be like -- To go to Heaven; which is supposedly a boring place where only old people take solace in or in an entirely alternate world, where its total chaos caused by the Demon King to whom the people live in fear of and it would mean their freedom if the Demon King is defeated. \\n\\n\r\nIt's inevitable what Kazuma would choose as his fate to be, as a hardcore gamer who can experience his wish from his wildest dreams; to be an adventurer and a hero in a world filled with fantasies! He also gets an additional wish fulfilled, that is to have anything he wishes for -- from weapons to superpowers, to aid him on his journey to defeat the Demon King. Interestingly he chooses Aqua, who is none other than the Goddess waiting for Kazuma after his death!\\n\\n\r\nAs unwillingly as she is forced to join Kazuma on his quest, Aqua the Goddess takes on the challenge in order to get back to her original role as a Goddess. At first, the two seem to be a band of misfits, which is apparent by Aqua's arrogant personality and Kazuma's constant teasing of her calling her as a 'Dame-Gami' meaning a Useless Goddess. As the two march forwards they're joined by two other members; Megumin and Darkness. Apparently Megumin is an arch wizard who's a total klutz and clumsy all the time. One of her prominent feature in the show is her love for the technique \"Explosion!\", which is supposedly the strongest wizard attack there is. One setback of Megumin using this technique is it trains out all her energy and she's only able to propel it once at a time. She's often called the crazy girl for her over-exaggerating behavior and that's something she dislikes a lot. Kazuma's telling that he finds 'Megumin' as a weird name pisses her off, too. However, Megumin is one of the funniest character in the show and also the easily likable one. Darkness is a member that joins last in the group. She's a Knight and oddly... a masochist? Apparently she has one problem of missing the target and hitting something insignificant more, but that's just not about it, she has this weird fetish for being turned on in the most despairing situations! As often as her fights are with the villains and enemies, she always quotes the possibility of being overwhelmed in the fight and turning herself in, only to be sexually molested to the opposition's pleasings. And strangely enough, this turns her on even more! Quite excitingly though, this is one of the funniest feature of the whole show. Megumin might be the best girl of the show in my opinion, but I'll definitely ship Darkness and Kazuma more! (Sorry Aqua, try harder in the second season).\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes! Talking about a possibility of having a second season, it's already been announced officially! I only just started this show a day earlier, and as I hit the halfway mark in the show, I was already so excited about the prospect of it having a second season, something which is a first for me!\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the visuals of the show, and as well as the cons of it. The art style of the show throughout is underwhelming to say it in a word, with shoddy production values being evident. It was mediocre to begin with, but it does also shift to a worse position in some sections of the show, with the art being much more goofy than usual. This might be something Studio DEEN suffered from in its run, but its definitely something that wasn't lacking with the show providing plenty of positives that overwhelms the negatives in my opinion. The voice casting also brings in some of the newer personnel than usual we see in anime, but they definitely felt like professionals to me with them being in such a good sync with the characters and their traits as well. Jun Fukushima does an excellent job handling Kazuma and had his voice in perfect shape from one situations to the other. Rie Takahashi's youthful voice goes hand in hand with Megumin's quirky behavior. Kudos to the voice casting for a job very well done. The OP & ED simply do their jobs, they're nothing outstanding nor do they contribute to any expectations to come from the show. The ED is a nice country music-like and is joyful to hear. \\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba isn't touching great heights with its story weaving but its not just a mere comedy show. That's a pure understatement to this show. When I say KonoSuba is legitimately funny, I mean it. With regular chaos-filled fights to the squad quarrels, the dialogues are immersed with excitement. \\n\\n\r\nThis is my only pitch to you, watch KonoSuba and appreciate the entertainment it so wonderfully provides.\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes anime studios surprise me by their ideas, expertly hiding all drawbacks by the good animation and a silly comedy.\r\nGive people great animation, with exciting characters, they immediately lose any logic.\r\nI understand that KonoSuba is primarily a comedy, and talk about some sense, it's silly, because humor, in itself, has no boundaries, but humor in this anime it's a main problem.\r\nBitter talk about it, but humor was never been a strong point in anime, because comedy often try to limit in school genre.\r\nThe problem is that any comedy scene takes place with the participation of someone's girl's pants and mostly with hints Hiki generation. Ido not want to say that comedy in this area was inappropriate, but it continues throughout all ten episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSince we understand this is a comedy,  the viewer is immediately ready to be a lot of absurd things, and in this is collapse of KonoSuba . Showing himself with a humorous side, it continues stretch all ten episodes unchanged. From third episode, when we already seen all characters (about it below) humor is monotonous. All comedy scenes will refer to perversion by female characters and center of all this will be the protagonist. And of course they not forget to show shaking chest all the main women's characters, by the way, some of them even going without underwear.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with death of the main character from shock, he finds himself in so-called purgatory, where goddess invites him to get into another world, with a particular feature that he should think it himself. He chooses to take a goddess with him, and from this begins their way in the new world.\\n\r\nThis world is built by all the canons of MMORPG, to earn money and increase, need to do out quests, with main target kill the King of Demons.\\n\r\nAlthough KonoSuba has a specific goal in mind, it is still have more episodic format, and this is second main problem in this series.\\n\\n\r\nWith its episodic format, some characters are not remembered, while others simply disappear without a purpose in series.\\n\r\nThe four main characters, is actually pretty standard, they are arranged according by rules of the genre \"Harem\".\\n\r\n- Goddess Aqua, a bit silly, not wearing panties, seductive and sometimes useful, serves as a very close girl of protagonist.\\n\r\n- Knight Latalina is worst character, in my opinion, she has a masochistic tendencies that are supposed to entertain audience, perhaps for the first time and it will seem ridiculous, but KonoSuba repeating same jokes throughout of the anime. Not to mention that Knight Warrior is one of the most common characters in hentai.\\n\r\n- What regard Megumin, she plays role of so-called clown in the series. It's strange to talk about it, but it's only character who pulls this anime from the pit.\\n\r\n- Kazuma is a typical retard with flat jokes and do idiotic action.\\n\\n\r\nHowever Art & Animation made at a high level. Environment shown is very beautiful, moments of casting spells, magic and other things made in good style. I think this is only thing that really turned out well. I dont seen a defects in animation of characters, each of them is made beautiful and attracts attention.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and sound, dont have particular drawbacks too. Opening and Ending is average, throughout the series is a good sound in battles.\\n\r\nBut still, look for flaws in music or animation does not make sense, as I previously said that this anime hides all their flaws. And to do bad, then, that immediately catches eye, is to doom himself to failure.\\n\\n\r\nPresenting itself from first episode, as a comedy, KonoSuba doomed themselves to failure. Comedy in this series does not improve the show, conversely only spoil it, by the end it becomes clear what to expect a clever humor is meaningless. All ways go only to a many silly dialogues, to depraved poses and jokes in \"Ecchi\" style.\\n\\n\r\nKono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! - this shows how should not look comedy, it can be considered one of the unsuccessful attempts to make a joke on Hikki generation.",

            "content": "I've always been a firm believer of the idea that you should never judge an anime by its cover alone. There are good and bad examples of series from every single genre after all, and you can never know for sure which side any one specific anime will fall on before you watch it. That being said, you can still normally make some sort of very rough premature estimation for what an anime will be like, and the vast majority of the time you'll probably be right. It's exceedingly rare for an anime to completely blow away whatever initial expectations you may have had onit, and deliver something truly memorable seemingly out of thin air. KonoSuba however is one of those cases.\\n\\n\r\nThe idea of having a shut-in otaku being transported into an RPG-like fantasy world for some convenient reason and immediately ending up with some sort of semi-sexualized female entourage upon arrival is not exactly an original concept at this point. Ever since the enormous financial success of Sword Art Online there has been an absolute surge of new anime following roughly the same idea. But there is one thing which makes KonoSuba a totally different experience from any of the others, and that is that this is nothing more than a parody. There is no cheesy drama, cheap writing or needless clich\u00e9s; hell there's barely even any story progression at all. KonoSuba is a 100% pure comedy, nothing more, nothing less. But it's a really damn funny one at that.\\n\\n\r\nFor one, the defining trait of all the female main characters of this anime is that they're all utterly useless. Firstly there's Aqua, a supposed \"goddess\" but essentially the only thing she's good at is party tricks, and her IQ is on about the level of a goldfish. Secondly, there's best girl of the season Megumin, a chuuni archwizard who has a diehard obsession with explosion magic, and operates on a 24 hour cooldown since it takes all her physical energy to cast even a single spell. And lastly we have \"Darkness\", a righteous knight incapable of even hitting anyone in battle. On the other hand she's very good at tanking as she's also a hardcore masochist who fantasizes about being kidnapped and sexually abused by her demonic enemies on the battlefield. Uhm\u2026 yeah.\\n\\n\r\nThe real icing on the cake though is probably the MC himself. Kazuma is far from your ordinary MMO anime lead, nor your typical harem protagonist for that matter. First of all he's actually pretty weak in terms of fighting prowess, and actually feels like the average NEET he's supposed to be. But also the way he talks and acts around the girls from his party is just hilarious. His general mindset would be something along the lines of \"ahh~ I'm surrounded by morons, someone please shoot me\". He serves both as the tsukkomi to all the stupid shit the girls are doing all the time, as well as the one who has to clean up the mess they make. He can be a bit abusive every once in a while, but most of the time it's perfectly warranted, and even when it's not it's still done in a very light-hearted and comedic fashion. I've seen some people try to overanalyze this anime and look for deeper political messages and stuff, but I implore you to *please* don't do that. Like really, what's the point? This is a pure comedy anime and not something which should be taken seriously whatsoever. Let's leave it that way, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, there's not really a whole lot to say about the plot other than that it follows Kazuma and his party's daily lives as they struggle to get enough money to get food on the table and a better place to sleep than in the stables. However, with constant mishaps along their way, often cause by some rather idiotic things done by certain party members, this turns out to be a lot easier said than done. You won't be seeing any epic boss fights or life-or-death drama in this RPG; just a bunch of weirdos making fools out of themselves in low-level quests. But honestly... I vastly prefer it this way.\\n\\n\r\nNow if there is anything to really complain about in this anime then it's quite clearly the animation. Saying that this is a low budget production would be an understatement. The character designs actually look pretty terrible a lot of the time, with awkward facial structures and hilarious derp faces. However... this actually isn't always a bad thing. A lot of comedic moments are actually *enhanced* by this. Like the reaction faces to certain gags just come across as even funnier than if they had been drawn properly, and since KonoSuba is purely a comedy anime it's actually not really a problem if you look at it that way. Of course this excuse isn't always applicable though, as the bad character designs are often prevalent during non-comedic moments as well, and in that case there's no upside to it anymore. So it depends on how you look at it. Interestingly enough though, the backgrounds, and not to mention the special effects for Megumin's spells, actually look really good. It's really just the character designs that are broken.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, KonoSuba is only a 10-episode anime, which is probably further evidence of the very limited budget the studio had to work with. However, those were 10 damn good episodes so I can't really feel too disappointed about it. Also despite the low budget, this has been by far the most successful show of Winter 2016 financially speaking, with the light novel's sales having absolutely skyrocketed ever since the anime began airing. And the results speak for themselves, as a second season has already been greenlit, so there's plenty more goodness to come in due time. Maybe they'll even have a proper budget this time around.\\n\\n\r\nIt's been quite some time since I saw an anime as jam-packed with entertainment value as KonoSuba has been, and even longer since I saw a better comedy. And given that it didn't even look like a gag show to begin with, that's really saying something. But maybe that'll help serve as a subtle reminder that judging an anime by its cover is in fact never a good thing to do. You never know what you might miss out on.",

            "content": "\"Too good to be just a comedy,\" that is how I originally felt at first about this show. Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! To begin, Kono-Suba is a parody of almost every other RPG/Fantasy game or anime ever made. What it does though (obviously I might add) is pokes fun at them while remaining unique in it's own way. Every time I watched a new episode, it was sort of like the events that took place were in between predicable and unpredictable. What worked out in it's favor is that the shows unpredictable nature. Certain moments surprised, like came out of nowhere me amade make me laugh my ass off. \\n\\n\r\nStory- 7/10\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the story, I really admired creativity and uniqueness. To me, it was sort of like Natsume Akatsuki (Original creator) and later the producers of Studio Deen watched a bunch of fantasy anime or played a bunch of games and said \"hey, you see how serious this Goddess is? what if she wasn't so serious? what if we added such a crazy personality to her\" and things kind of lifted off the ground from there. The final result, the thing that actually matters is what makes me believe that it was well put together. There were most likely lots of people in the development of KonoSuba who have had countless hours, days, years, of experience watching or playing fantasy games along with the original creator to make this show feel so accurate. I personally believe that Studio Deen did a great job with this series. I think that one of the many things that makes an anime great is the studio and creators enthusiasm and passion for a project. When you watch this show, which I would highly recommend, you can tell by the pacing and flow of the show that the creators had a really good time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the number one thing that I loved so much about KonoSuba is the characters. Though it's possible, I don't think I could have asked for a better cast of characters for this show. Aqua, Kazuma, Megumin and \"Darkness\" are hilarious in their own unique and respective ways. Although some characters are more favorable than others, I personally found myself very found of Megumin, I mean who couldn't like a little girl whose only magic is EXPLOSION!! I find her hilarious, and its' always fun seeing her in action. Aqua is perhaps my second favorite because her personality reminds me of another favorite character of mine from a similar show No Game No Life. Aside from that Aqua's natural, I'm actually going to say natural habit of getting the party into trouble is always fun to watch. I just find it very difficult for myself to dislike any of the characters. In fact going back to that \"predictable and unpredictable\" statement I made earlier that is something that really works with them. It's like some episodes you don't know who is going to be useful or not. Because it's part of the shows genre, and I want to touch on it a little with this being a harem and all, I am really glad to see that there seems to be (at the moment at least) no romance. Personally, and I am really hoping that (unless there is a season 2) there is no romantic relationships between the characters, I like that Kazuma can be the perverted \"Hikikomori\" or \"neet\" whatever he is freely without having to think so much about romance, or \"love.\" I personally think that also works out in the shows favor. I mean, having him fall in love with one of the ladies in his part might be possible however I just do not see it happening. One last thing that I want to add, and this depends on the viewers but at times characters can come off as a bit annoying. i personally found myself annoyed at times with Aqua, Megumin, Kazuma's and Darkness's behaviors.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, with the art and animation, it's pretty damn good! we have late 2012-14 animation style going on here. That works great with this show, I do not think they could have chosen a better style for this show. Especially because it had moments, great moments, where I found myself admiring most of the background settings and main focuses example being fights. My most favorite by far was the fight scene between Dullahan and Kazuma's squad. The sound effects, and background music used during this scene really enhanced my viewing pleasure. That aside there are just a numerous amount of scenes in this show where the music and art is visually stunning and spectacular, again please check out this series if you haven't already.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSomething that I really want to add, in addition to the show being \"great\" or me saying that it's too good to be just a comedy earlier. The comedy was at first a pain in the ass for me. When I started the show I thought is was absolutely frustrating to see a show with such great potential to be something greater wasted. It wasn't until around episode 4 that the comedic parts sank in and it completely changed my view on the show. Aside from the \"serious nature\" all of the elements in Konosuba works. There are so many things for fans of both old and new fantasy adventure anime can enjoy. Whether you love the music, art, characters, fan service or just the story, everything in Konosuba sort of plays out kind of naturally for all to enjoy. Personally, although possible of course, I would find this show moderately hard to disapprove of among even the most experienced reviewers and critics. Now to wrap things up, Konosuba in my opinion was a fun work of art. It had potential to be something even greater, it was memorable, and will most likely be a show that fans (such as myself) will definitely keep talking about later down the road. I personally, hope to see a season 2 further down the road. Konsuba totally deserves another run. I think this show deserves and has earned 3rd place for best anime of Winter 2015.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts-\\n\\n\r\nOverall I gave this show a 9/10 because it did a great job in all departments, art, animation, character etc. What really played into my rating though was wonderfully hilarious characters.. I could not have asked for any changes in the characters' department Natsume Akatsuki did a really great job making likable, cute and such awesome characters.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Here is an attitude that tends to dishearten me a little: why are people so hostile to douchebag protagonists? Sure, if you are supposed to like or sympathize with an asshole it becomes a big turn off, as it makes the series hypocritical and morally bankrupt, like Zero no Tsukaima (I had to take that jab!), but when that is not the case, having a main lead with very visible flaws can give a very clear idea of a future character arc and make such lead a more interesting figure, That aside, what if the series is about none of that? What if the respectivetitle is not so much a comedy of errors, but a comedy of wrong people? That is certainly a way of getting an easily likeable douche as your lead.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are not bored by the intro I just gave, allow me to tell you why \u201cKono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!\u201d, or KonoSuba for short, is awesome and you should watch it.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve been paying attention to the anime community at least in the last two years or so, you\u2019re likely to have noticed a trend that has become infamous among light novel adaptations: an incredibly bland and overpowered main character, who blazes through the story effortlessly obliterating his enemies, while developing a harem for himself with the gravitational pole of his Mary Sue genitals. This trend is specially exemplified by titles like Sword Art Online, Asterisk Wars, Overlord, The Irregular at Magic Highschool, etc, and as much as it has been gathering very vocal hatred, it also seems reluctant to fade away. KonoSuba, in the other hand, seems to be a title crafted in diametric opposition to such trends, having a set up that is, on the most surface level possible, similar, but diverging highly in how it plays out.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are curious about why I called this series a comedy of wrong people, it\u2019s because none of the characters that receive the focus of the story is characterized as fit for the tasks they face and the plot itself doesn\u2019t care about raising them as unlikely heroes, but instead on exploiting them in the silly RPG-like situations they find themselves into. KonoSuba is a parody in its simplest and most charming form: it\u2019s not focused on big and over-the-top events that take the piss out of the genre by relying on absurdity, but it builds its narrative on small comedic events that stack up, creating multiple consistent punchlines that don\u2019t cease being a part of the world the series created. From the giant frogs that lead the crew to find a new member, to the Succubus prostitutes that motivate the warriors to defend the city against overwhelming odds, every joke has an in-universe purpose. \\n\\n\r\nAll that aside, let\u2019s talk about the characters a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist, Kazuma, is the unlucky male lead who got thrown into this phantasy world by his unwillingness to go to heaven and staying a virgin for the rest of eternity. Can\u2019t blame the guy, I\u2019d do the same in his place. Despite what I said in the introduction, Kazuma is not exactly a lead designed with the purpose of being unlikeable, although being still a snarky prick (I can actually relate to that!) and somewhat of a troll, with no shame on taking advantage of the situation in ways that lead to embarrassment to others. A former shut-in and the most frequent voice of reason of his group of air-heads, his situation of the world of KonoSuba is surprisingly relatable: he is constantly facing failure, with only occasional moments of success and hardly earned achievements to motivate him and his group to stay on the journey.\\n\\n\r\nAqua is an idiot, and one of the best kind. Unlike other shows where the idiot of the bunch is only responsible for bringing misfortune to his colleagues and never becomes aware of how much their stupidity costs to others, Aqua faces first-hand the effects of her actions. Being the lovably greedy and selfish twat she is and desperate to get out of the world she got stuck in, Aqua is constantly making reckless decisions and engaging in equally ill-thought out actions, only to have Kazuma stop or save her, so that she can incur in the same mistakes again, in the vain attempt of getting some easy money and more confortable situation. The contrast of such egocentric behavior with her lack of wit and constant misfortune makes some of the best comedic takes of the series.\\n\\n\r\nNext is Megumi, the overly-confident, but hopelessly underprepared mage of the group. Prideful of her alleged \u201ccrimson demon\u201d origins and unconditionally infatuated with explosive spells, the most powerful brand of offensive magic, she refuses to learn any other kind of spell, even though her body is clearly unprepared to handle such taxing kind of magic. The comedy of her character comes mostly from passing out whenever she unleashes her attacks, being made completely vulnerable against enemies and putting the burden of her protection on her colleagues. I now realized that this doesn\u2019t sound funny at all, but trust me, in context in works wonders, especially in contrast with the already precarious state of her party.\\n\\n\r\nLastly there\u2019s Darkness, the noble swordswoman with high stats in offense and defense, but laughably low accuracy, which means she\u2019ll be swinging that sword a lot, but rarely hitting anything besides the punch line. She is also a massive masochist, a trope that I\u2019ve personally become very fond in recent times. She latches onto the party under the belief that Kazuma is a perverted sadist who mistreats and humiliates the other girls, essentially all she wants for herself. In the long run she ends up placing great trust on Kazuma, and the series even hints of a possible romantic development between them, although that is not completely reliable, being this also a harem style comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe meat of KonoSuba\u2019s comedic energy (in simpler terms, the reason why it\u2019s so funny) is its focus on the small moments. The comedy is not so much focused on slapstick, although that is also a significant portion of it, but in quick character reactions that stand on their respective quirks and flaws of personality: Aqua is an impatient, selfish idiot, so she is bound to react desperate and childish when the prospect of financial loss is near; Megumi is overly confident and stubborn, so she boasts her power just to fall flat on her face right after, in more ways than the literal one; Darkness is a masochist and gleefully enjoys her own pain even when embarrassingly trying to hide it. Kazuma, however, is the character that takes the most out of it. Being a snarky douche, he will often be confronted with the girl\u2019s unwanted traits and react in ways to tangentially distance himself, like in the running gag:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cKazuma!\u201d\\n\r\n\u201cHi, Hi, Kazuma desu!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nHe is also quick to take advantage in the most fitting opportunity, like immediately attacking a knight when challenged to a fight where he is obviously disadvantaged, just to end it in a hilarious slapstick sequence. Huh, I might have killed that joke for anyone who has not watched it already! The series doesn\u2019t slow down in such antics even as it dives into \u201cdecisive\u201d battles and it plays its comedy as characters are about to face immense danger. When you think it\u2019s about to attempt some misplaced drama, KonoSuba pull itself back again with a joke built upon the same scene, never fully attempting to be heavy and dramatic, a mistake that other less sharp parody series make far too often.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I have often discussed when talking about presentation is the importance of keeping consistency in character models, as it is the most glaring flaw for animation to incur and can be specially detracting to the purpose the scene wants to convey. In the case of KonoSuba, though, it\u2019s somewhat of a pointless complaint to make, since this is one of the aspects the series relies on to drive its comedy. Many of the comedic takes focus on facial expression to emphasize characters reactions, so it\u2019s not unusual for them to have distorted and exaggerated features. This also works in the fanservice shots, when boobs will bounce aimlessly, to the point of killing the sexual appeal and turning it into a joke itself.\\n\\n\r\nPossibly to match the watery feel of the expressions and designs, the color pallet is also very light, with clear shades of blue, green and yellow, for example. Costumes, in the other hand, are quite vibrant and distinguish immediately from the characters themselves. Another aspect that contributes greatly to the action and humor is the movement, very smooth and unhinged, which gives a constant sense of energy at play, helping take the most out of the comedic sequences. It\u2019s actually surprising how little time goes by in the series without any movement happening on each frame.\\n\\n\r\nSound-wise, the main cast is mostly composed of actors who have yet to reach the hundreds of roles played, with the exception of Kayano Ai, but nonetheless deliver their performances in stellar fashion. Not only being each one a perfect fit for their respective characters, both in tone and pitch, but their delivery solidly lands the jokes with  precise timing. Special notes for Fukushima Jun (not Fukuyama, His Highness is yet to appear in this universe), who portrays Kazuma and never misses the point with the characters, both in his detached \u201cI\u2019m not even part of this group\u201d demeanor, as in his mischievous moments.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Ramblings\\n\\n\r\nHumor is a very subjective part of fiction, so it\u2019s hardly ever possible to say that something is objectively not funny. I believe however, it is possible to debate to some extent whether something is good comedy or not. That can be argue not only on the matter of \u201cdoes it make the audience laugh?\u201d, but also on how is the set up established, is the humor random or streamlined, do the characters stay consistent in their roles, does the writing ever descend into low brow humor, and if yes, does it treat the audience as at least intelligent people, and so forth. These aspect are, of course, open to subversion, depending on the writers talent to pull it off.\\n\\n\r\nNot many shows are able to make comedy out of incompetence without offering some balance. Most commonly, they will focus most of the punch lines on very specific characters while at the same time offering one as the trump card to solve conflict. What makes KonoSuba so endearing is its ability to make all of the characters into irreplaceable components of the jokes, without diminishing the value of any of them in the context of its universe. As much as the main party is overall composed of incompetent misfits to work out the comedy, they are all also important for the progression, even if accidentally. Well, perhaps better off accidentally, as it makes for even more outrageous outcomes, constantly adding up to the fun.\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba\u2019s crew of incompetent loonies may not be the best folks around when it comes to defeating the Demon King, but they sure were the best to turn a generic adventure into such an endearing trip to a world that is perhaps as wonderful as the title implies.\\n",

            "content": "Disclaimer: If you dislike fanservice and boob jiggles, this is not the anime for you. Bras don't seem to exist in the KonoSuba world and sexual jokes are everywhere. And now, the tl;dr:\r\nPros:\r\n1. The premise is new and interesting, being a parody of those RPG anime.\r\n2. The ED is very chill and nonsensical, which fits KonoSuba well.\r\nCons: \r\n1. Running jokes are reused too much without any changes.\r\n2. The characters are very one-dimensional.\r\n3. The story is rather choppy and at least one important arc is left out.\r\nThe premise of KonoSuba is about a very weak party in an alternate world resembling an RPG to parody theOP main characters of similar warp-into-a-game anime. However, I'm not one to watch this kind of anime much, so I can't say how effective it is or how refreshing it is to have a weak protagonist, but it is certainly a very interesting premise.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is pretty nice too. It is very relaxing and the lyrics don't really mean much. It fits the day-to-day goings of KonoSuba like a glove.\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba has pretty serious issues, however. It uses a few running jokes that are never really pulled off well. As a result, by ep 5 I got pretty bored of the comedy, especially the jokes involving Aqua and Darkness. Megumin also has running jokes associated with her, although I would say that hers are much better used by adapting to the context.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the characters are pretty much just their running jokes, making them extremely one-dimensional. Character development is totally non-existent, and interactions between Kazuma and Aqua or Darkness are always the same. The only main character who is an exception to this is, again, Megumin who is more of a proper character by being able to respond differently to different situations without relying on her main gag. But this is supposed to be the bare minimum of a character.\\n\\n\r\nTowards the end of the season, a few new characters appear out of nowhere with no history whatsoever within the anime, and one of them is pretty important. So it boggles me as to why the arc which introduces this character is only given a brief mention as a passing comment, and the viewers are expected to know who this character is.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, KonoSuba honestly fails as a comedy anime and its story goes nowhere. I can only really recommend this to those who are super hardcore about the isekai/game genre or those who really love parodies.",

            "content": "\"I'm an advocate of true gender equality, a guy who has no problem with doling out a drop kick to a female opponent. Don't think I'll go easy on you!\" -Kazuma Satou\r\nKono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! KonoSuba. God's Blessing On This Wonderful World. An anime that has taken so many people by surprise, at how tear-inducingly hilarious and amazing this turned out to be. After an insipid and uninspired first episode, I was not the least bit interested in this. I had thought this was going to turn out to be just another one of those generic fantasy series that comes out every season,with no particular defining quality or trait. Just another one of those anime whose only remotely memorable feature was the length of the name - and it isn't even that long by LN standards. Nothing interesting at all.\\n\\n\r\nBoy, I've never been so wrong. I'm so glad I don't drop things after a single episode, because I would have missed out on the absolute gem that KonoSuba turned out to be. The second episode took me completely by surprise. By the time it finished, I found myself questioning whether this was the same anime whose first episode I had watched a week prior. The hilarity came out of nowhere. The last thing I was expecting was for a single episode to completely revert my initially negative impression.\\n\\n\r\nBut anyway, enough with my monologuing. KonoSuba's premise is a simple one - after a very eccentric and ridiculous death, Kazuma Satou finds himself before the self-proclaimed Goddess Aqua, with the option to pass on to the afterlife, or be reborn into a new world where his mission would be to defeat Demon King in order to return back to his old life. He's also given one wish to be granted by Aqua in order to aid him in his endeavours.\\n\r\nThis is where we begin to see the way in which KonoSuba breaks away from the mould. Kazuma's brilliant idea is to wish for the Goddess Aqua herself to accompany him - why stick to a singular wish, when he could simply take the wish-granter herself along with hiim? This more practical manner of thinking begets hilarity after hilarity as the anime goes on.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a simple one. Defeat the Demon King, and go home. That's it. There's no grand, overlying scheme; no complex themes one has to scrutinise in detail in order to understand what's going on; nothing more than the simple premise for which everything takes place. This works in the anime's favour, because having such a loose goal means they can pretty much do anything they want inbetween, so long as it in some way takes them even a little closer towards the ultimate defeat of the Demon King.\\n\r\nAs the episodes go by, more characters are gradually introduced. In order to kill the Demon King, Kazuma and Aqua need a stronger and bigger party. This leads to them encountering Megumin and Darkness. From here on out, their adventurers and encounters are nothing short of zany, bizarre and ridiculous. Aqua the Goddess, Megumin the ArchWizard and Darkness the Crusader - all of these are exceptional people, holding classes and abilities which the common person could only dream of having. But despite their apparent prowess, it would not be possible to have a more dysfunctional party.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nIt is these characters and their interactions which make this such an amazing comedy. Kazuma is the glue that holds everything together. It is his cynical, practical and down-to-earth mentality that acts as the wall to the antics of the rest of his party. Without him, they would all fall apart; if not for him then achieving anything would be impossible thanks to their ridiculous flaws and inability to do anything without hazard. His reactions to all the misfortunes that befall him thanks to them never fail to entertain.\\n\\n\r\nAqua possesses no qualities one would expect of a Goddess. She is selfish. She is greedy. She's a gold-digger. She is lazy. She is demanding. Her first concern is herself; she has no other concerns. She can use a few anti-Undead spells, but is otherwise nearly useless in combat. She also has a knack of making everything worse, causing unnecessary damage and shifting all of the debt she incurs onto Kazuma.\\n\r\nMegumin suffers from a mild dose of chuunibyou, and excels in one partcular magic - explosions. She lives and breathes for them. She knows no other magic, as she does not believe any other magic to be needed. So long as she can blow something up, nothing else matters. This sounds good on paper, but she's only capable of casting one explosion before fainting from exhaustion.\\n\r\nDarkness is the Crusader - the beefy tank that takes the enemies' attention and soaks up the damage. She wields a massive sword capable of cleaving men in two... That is, assuming she can hit them. Her accuracy is shoddy if one were to describe it generously. Furthermore, she's a hardcore masochist. She loves being abused. Being pinned down and attacked - be it by friend or foe - is her creme de la creme.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to taking on quests, the 3 main girls are nothing short of useless - a fact Kazuma never fails to mention. His comments, interjections and general abuse hit them all right where it hurts. He never fails to remind Aqua she's a useless Goddess. He desperately tries to encourage Megumin to learn other magic. He's genuinely disturbed by Darkness' fetish. These problem-riddled girls provide an endless well of entertainment as Kazuma tries his utmost to simply get by each day without falling into debt and despair.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation.\\n\r\nThe art and animation is the worst aspect of this series. The art is quite plain and sometimes off. The eyes of the character seem a little too spaced apart. Whilst not being bad, the art really could do with some improvement. The animation is occasionally wonky, too. This was especially prevalent in one particular episode where boob-physics were quite...Fascinating, shall we say.\\n\r\nHowever, this was never able to detract from my enjoyment because I was too busy wiping the tears induced from laughing out of my eyes to care about the art. I'll also point out that Megumin's explosion sequence in particular actually looked really good. It is apparent a lot of effort was put into that; considering how frequently we saw her explosions this was a massive boon.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion.\\n\r\nKonoSuba - God's Blessing On This Wonderful World - was most certainly a blessing. This subverted every single opinion and impression I initially had. It very quickly - nay, INSTANTLY - rose to the position of my favourite anime from the Winter 2016 season. This is hands down one of the funniest anime I've ever had the fortune of watching. Kazuma is one of those rare male MCs who actually manages to steal the spotlight from his harem. His reactions, his methods of coping, everything he does makes this anime better. Without him acting as the sole voice of reason, those girls would have destroyed themselves. The contrast between his rationality and their insanity made for never-ending hilarity.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch this? Abso-fucking-lutely! Comedy is entirely subjective. Not everyone will like it; that's only natural. But give this 3-4 episodes before deciding. Wait until all the characters are introduced, because they all bring a different dynamic to the table. Their sole similarity is their uselessness. If you still find yourself unamused, then that's a shame. But otherwise, you're in for one Hell of a ride.\\n\r\nThe one and only problem with KonoSuba is that it's only 10 episodes long. Aside from this crime against humanity? KonoSuba has ran away with my expectations. I loved it. Hopefully you will too.\\n",

I haven't laughed so much with an anime since I watched Noucome , Gintama was close and so was Nozaki Kun .... \r\nKonoSuba characters are each individually funny in their own circumstances . You might be thinking this is another rip off of similar anime's settings like SAO , Dungeon ni Deal . But my oh my you have thought otherwise. KonoSuba provides me with all the Positive vibes I hoped for. \r\nStory - 6\r\nKazuma our MC is grouped up with probably the 3 most troublesomeclan members you'd ever want to have. \\n\r\nIt doesn't have a serious plot to it, but one of the more cliche and generic ones where the MC has been tasked with defeating the Demon King in the new world he has been reincarnated into. The episodes itself don't really progress with the plot because the group itself is isolated in one town. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation + Art - 7\\n\r\nAt first you might think the art maybe off-putting , I did at first and I know a small minority probably did as well.  But as you watch more and more, the art is more of a Gain then a loss . The character designs are really unique in the sense that each character has there own unique dress code that makes them stand out. \\n\r\nThe Animation is pretty average but is highly favorable and suited to the personalities and expressions of each character . But on some occasions has been poor as if the animators were high whilst animating.\\n\r\nBut one thing it animated brilliantly.  ARE THE BOOBS!!! I have never witnessed such Boob Mechanics in an anime before. Scientists need to study this and evaluate the Philosophy behind this. Because I have no idea why it has been animated this way. NOT THAT I'M COMPLAINING :)\\n\r\nOn the other hand , I do believe Michael Bay would love to watch the explosion scenes and take some notes to use for his new Transformer installments xD\\n\\n\r\nSound + Music + Voice - 7.5\\n\r\nThe Opening isn't my cup of tea . I wouldn't repeatedly listen to it on a daily basis and have occasionally skipped it, whilst watching episodes . It's definitely not as catchy and memorable as some of the other openings this Winter. Such as in Dimension W , Erased or Gate Season 2. \\n\r\nHowever, I will give credit to the ending song which is far more soothing and relaxing to listen to. \\n\r\nKazuma Seiyuu (Fukushima, Jun) deserves more recognition and defo needs more casting roles in the future . I adore his voice .  The overall cast itself is really suited to each character in which is the reason as to why i have noted this as 7.5 . If just music alone I would of probably given it a 4 or 5.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\r\nKazuma - Probably my All time Favorite MC.  He is just so lovable in a sense that I could go Gay for him. ( P.S I'm Joking ) . \\n\r\nOn a serious note. Kazuma is pretty useless and ineffective as an individual within the group. He isn't at all OP but has his own strengths when defeating  his opponents who are far more talented then he is . But that is really what makes him one of the Best MC's out there. \\n\r\nAqua - The Clumsy and annoying Goddess in the group. Kazuma would probably go along these lines and say \" You're living, you occupy space , and you have a mass. You Matter\" That's probably what he thought when he reincarnated with her. But she is more of a nuisance, when you think she has been useful to the group on some quests or missions , she makes their budget and life far worse .  \\n\r\nMegumin - The cute one and Micheal Bay's Future Wife. She is pretty useless after she has activated her special ability EXPLOSION!!!! That she ends up paralyzed for a certain amount of time .( Kazuma has it hard )\\n\r\nDarkness-  A Masochist that tends to have perverted thoughts such as the time she was battling one of the Demon Kings Knights. She is useless herself in that she can never seem to hit her target. \\n\r\nAll these characters have there own unique personalities that overall makes the anime far more enjoyable , one thing they do to lack is some development but that doesn't take anything away from how comedically funny they are. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nThis show is my icing on the cake. It has entertained me from its first episode to its last. Shame it was only 10 episodes and only adapted 2 volumes of the LN . But the OVA is soon to air and Season 2 is announced so the hype is real. If you want something to laugh and you really enjoy harem/fantasy/comedy  then watch KonoSuba whenever you have time and marathon it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating 9\\n",

            "content": "\"KonoSuba!\"\r\nI will be very honest before I start this anime review, at first I wasn't going to pick this series up, or lets say I putted this series on a low Top 15 Anticipated of the Winter Season 2016 because of the studio behind it being DEEN. And as you guys do know, DEEN is a studio that tends to have... let's say \"horrible\" animation quality or handles. Besides that, the studio was stained due to the apparent adaptation of Fate/stay Night 2006. This brings to me a lot of questions since it's a nitpick for me to pick this series up. However, looking througha bit more, I decided to give this anime a shot. And what did my reaction was regarding on this anime? Let's find out.\\n\\n\r\nNote to the viewer that's reading this review of KonoSuba, firstly everyone has their subjective opinion regarding on the comedy aspect, so a note to the reader, this is not objectively speaking. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nThe story is set in a fantasy world where basically, the story starts off our little NEET character Kazuma, continuing his little life of otaku, when suddenly when walking around back to the house, he suddenly sees a person almost getting killed by a truck, so in a desperate attempt to save the character, Kazuma pushed her out of the way, thus causing to die in the act.\\n\\n\r\nHe then meet this goddess also known as Aqua, where she then gave him a request or a chance to live in the other world, but he can also take something with him. His quest is to defeat the evil Demon King, after him taking the object that he wants to take, Aqua and Kazuma ended up in this fantasy world, where basically they have to do quests, missions, etc.\\n\\n\r\nNow this is basically your stereotypical \"stuck in a fantasy world\" aspect (just like Log Horizon and Sword Art Online), which many people or some people do not really like the idea. However, KonoSuba takes this type of aspect of the show and makes it its own, by making fun of the fantasy-tropes or aspect, making it seem very refreshing for me. Not only that it helps to stand out, but subjectively its very funny with its comedic fashion direction.\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba takes the direction of also self-awareness, thus the show does know what its trying to do and knows what its doing, which helps a lot with the parody of itself. It's a good way for the series to have different segments of events, from the beginning of \"Kazuma dying because of said reasons (not spoiling here)\" towards the hilarious quirks such as the cabbage scene, the entire curse effect, etc.\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba personally does its job to keep me entertained for the long run time, as its very comedic and relaxing to watch, this is a series that I personally love, and watch it first from the Wednesdays time-run. Its a show that keeps me interested at least along with the character section. \\n\\n\r\nThe only complaint that I have for the series its the amount of episodes this series got, due to the time-run being 10 episodes, it makes me want to crave me for it. Of course its pretty obvious for me to get craved for it, but that's personal. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand at the end of the final episode, when everyone thought DEEN wouldn't make a second season (of course since as far as I'm concerned DEEN doesn't make that many sequels with the exception of maybe a few) they quickly announced right off the bat a second season coming. Which is good because not only that the show did well with what it had, but it deserved it as well. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the series is fun and entertaining to watch at the end of the day. I would warn that if you're expecting something deep or well written story telling with meanings, I wouldn't suggest this one, this one is only relaxing and a pass the time series for the audience and for the fans of comedy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nSo basically we have a so called \"Stereotypical MC with 3 girls around him.\" Right? In a way yes, but at the very least these characters can stand out on their own thanks to their characterization and their little quirks that makes them enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nKazuma, our main male protagonist, is one of the most interesting main male characters I've seen in a while, and probably one of the funniest guys I've seen around as well in a while. Because for some reason, his commentaries on certain events or situations makes me enjoy the show a lot, and people could say he's pretty much overpowered. Or very strong. You could complain and pick as a flaw, but in all honesty, in spite of that Kazuma's quirks are just very well done, and thought enough to make him likeable for the long-running. Not only that but his prior knowledge around gaming fantasy are pretty nice per say. I will say he's one of the most likeable characters around this season personally, based personality wise.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, we got Aqua which she's the goddess of the world where she resided. The girl can be considered debatable, because at one hand people say she's funny as fuck and likeable, the other hand people would say that she's pretty much retarded in many ways. Personally, I can agree Aqua is pretty idiotic, but in a rather funny way that makes her special and likeable. It's really funny how she gets into these type of issues and problems in which I cannot stop laughing and neither stop feeling bad for the girl. Not only that but her face is too cute when she makes the sad expressions.\\n\\n\r\nThirdly we have Megumin, our little \"EXPLOSIONS\" character. She's pretty much considered a Chuunin if you think about Rika Takanashi from Chuunibyou. She's very energetic at times, loves to play with explosions and ONLY that, she goes over exaggerated with her sentences/dialogue which makes er pretty enjoyable. Not only that but she's pretty cute, and pretty laughable when she uses the explosions magic, which she has an apparent limit of using it once per day and she falls down in a rather comedic fashion. She's one of the best girls of the series.\\n\\n\r\nLastly we got Darkness, which she's the sadist character among the cast, and she looks like a freaking armor because she likes a lot of pain, and gets arousements from it. She's considered as a masochist in the series which I'm not going to lie, she is pretty damn funny when she gets these arousements of denials and protecting. Like holy shit that I won't lie she's pretty laughable. But not only that she's a knight. I LOVE knights.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the supporting characters, they aren't really memorable per say, but at the same time they aren't bland either. I just felt like they could have taken a little role of course, but I guess that's asking too much personally. On the other hand not gonna lie, some of the characters even though they don't appear much seem to have the appeal for me, so that's a bonus.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\\n\r\nAs I said previously, this series is a product from DEEN, the same studio who brought us shows such as Fate/stay Night 2006, Kore wa Zombie desu ka?, the massive Boy love animes for fangirls to enjoy!(Junjou Romantica and Sekaiichi Hatsukoi), Higurashi na ku koro ni, etc. \\n\\n\r\nWhile this is more debatable, people would go for either sides. Again, DEEN is pretty much a studio that has a lack for art/animation quality many times in some animes, however for KonoSuba, there's a thing that keeps me to my attention.\\n\\n\r\nAt one hand people would go and say that the art/animation is pretty horrible, and doesn't help with the designs nor the series, at the other hand, its pretty good for the series.\\n\\n\r\nThis case I will go for the either sides. Let me go to the perspective of the show. \\n\\n\r\nBased upon the character designs, I will agree base on the Light Novel readers (some of them) that the artstyle for the designs aren't the greatest there to live up to the source or the Illustrations (Mishima Kurone), however does it make the character designs bad? Not really personally.\\n\\n\r\nLike I do agree that the character designs could be done better, but because of the series being a comedy, the art and animation helps a lot with the series with the quirks and the events happening, even though the animation derps would look pretty bad, it actually works for the series because the expressions gives emphasis of the comedy factor. It helps a lot to make the series more laughable than what it should be, which I appreciate the studio and its animators to make the series work with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe only issue I would have with the animation would be the drop a lot quality for the 9th episode, as it was still laughable, but you can really see the massive derps everywhere in the anime. Which I can't deny it was pretty... I don't want to say it, but pretty eh? Pretty much.\\n\\n\r\nApart from that the background art does not look bad at all. It actually works with the character designs of the series, it gives a bright color scheme and suitable atmosphere with it, as well with the series surroundings. It helps a lot with the series personally.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the entire art/animation quality is quite debatable, but I personally would say that this department is the biggest spotlight around the series because of its usage of animation for the comedic factor of the show.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound/Voice Acting:\\n\\n\r\nI would say that the music... isn't quite memorable actually. I mean, it DOES help with some events of the anime and it gives a more humorous tone to it, and a bit of spark as well, however I don't think it's anything memorable factor personally. Now it doesn't mean that the music is bad of course, it's just the weakest factor of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department is quite actually very nice appealing for the series, I won't deny for the sound department it helps as well with the series although I will say I had some issues with some of the tones they used for the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part about the department is personally the voice acting. The voices of the characters helps to make these characters more vivid and humorous, which for Kazuma, Aqua, Darkness, Megumin, all did their respective roles very well in representation, and I love that, its pretty nice to make these characters have some sort of liveliness.\\n\\n\r\nFor the Opening and the Ending song, I will say the Opening is more like the \"Happy Jolly\" type, its pretty catchy as well with being too cute personally. Not only that but when Aqua appears when introducing the episode name is pretty nice and cuuuuute. Yeah too much saying cute right?\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Ending... I'm not really a fan of this... its pretty much your stereotypical ending song, it appeals to the visuals, but as a standalone its not my favorite.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI will honestly say despite the hole left inside of me when the series left (for now), I still enjoyed its ride from the beginning towards the end, regardless of the complaints people made with the animation and the art (exception for the 9th episode), and its a series that has this stereotypical setting but made itself stand out from the others because of the direction this series took. Which I totally love a lot about it. From the characters, towards the comedy, etc.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nI would really recommend KonoSuba a lot, personally this is one of those series that has a lot of enjoyment out of it, and its one of the best series around Winter 2016 for me personally. I would recommend the show towards people that likes comedy a lot, and wants a pass the time series to just have fun.\\n\\n\r\nWho shouldn't I recommend?\\n\\n\r\nI guess if people are looking for something rather deep or complex, something different (I mean many people do not like these things) I would suggest:\\n\\n\r\n- Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu (another show made by DEEN in the same season, but with having story telling for these type of people)",

            "content": "First of all, I\u2019m a girl, probably not the audience the makers of this anime had in mind. I found myself annoyed with stuff that I think most boys won\u2019t complain over. Second, the whole \u2018game/fantasy world trope\u2019 was never my cup of tea. I watched Re:Zero, officially the worst show I ever watched (in my opinion) and I tried to watch SAO, but never got further than the first episode, because I hated everything about. Still, I thought I would give Konosuba a chance and I actually don\u2019t regret it. I enjoyed the first few episodes quite a bit and at some points, Ieven cracked a smile.\\n\\n\r\nBut\u2026 that doesn\u2019t take away that most of the episodes\u2026 were shit. The story wasn\u2019t original to begin with. It is seriously the most overused trope in anime history (except for maybe the \u2018power of friendship\u2019). I can\u2019t say Konosuba had potential, \u2018cause it didn\u2019t. The only thing that was maybe a bit original, was the fact that our main character Kazuma didn\u2019t had a lot of things going for him. Instead of a fancy power, he chose a useless goddess. His fantasy world wasn\u2019t what he dreamt of: he started of as a novice who basically couldn\u2019t do anything. I\u2019m glad that they at least tried to do something different\u2026 Sadly it doesn\u2019t make up for the lack of originality in the rest of the story. Besides from that, Konosuba is also filled with a lot and a lot of fanservice, that I just can't stand. I\u2019ve seen a lot of shows with a goddamn lot of fanservice and it always annoys me, but when they make a whole episode just for the fanservice\u2026 It broke my heart a little. I can take a little fanservice every now and then\u2026 but a whole episode? Not only did it put me off, it also ruined \u2018the flow\u2019 of the story.\\n\\n\r\nNext, characters. I hoped that the characters would be better than in most other shounen\u2026 but they weren\u2019t. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m still hoping for a shounen with strong female characters (and I don\u2019t mean strong like Mikasa from AoT, I mean strong like\u2026 actually well written). All the girls in this show were just plain stupid. I mean, is it that much of a hassle to make one girl smart? Just one, not all of them\u2026 one. Or to give a girl some kind of complex personality? I mean\u2026 I can round all of these characters up in just a few words, what means they\u2019re just shallow and didn\u2019t go through any development at all. First, we have Aqua, a arrogant, annoying, screaming, egocentric goddess. Next, we have Megumin, a girl who\u2026 loves explosions \u2013 that\u2019s really her only personality trait, if you can even call it that. And last, we have Darkness, who is a masochist that wants to protect people, I guess? I don\u2019t get why some people get invested in these characters, they\u2019re just stupid. \\n\\n\r\nWe also have Kazuma. Our main hero, who is a guy, so of course he does have a certain amount of intelligence. I mean, why would you give a girl some common sense, how is our hero going to save her if she\u2019s capable of saving herself? So, Kazuma has common sense, constantly complains about the stupid world he ended up in and he is annoyed with all those stupid girls surrounding him. Naturally, somewhere along the way he starts to care for them and they all become bff\u2019s. What I did like about Kazuma, is that he becomes stronger at a slow rate, much more believable than Aqua, who suddenly gets some epic tricks out of nowhere. \\n\\n\r\nAnd my last comment about the characters (somebody needs to say it): is every man in Konosuba a pervert? I mean, at the final episode, all of the men began to fight\u2026 only after they thought of their nights with the succubi? Is that really their only motivation? Even if they\u2019re just side characters\u2026 give them some substance please.\\n\r\nI understand that it is meant to be funny and not taken so seriously\u2026 but can we maybe have a funny show with some decent characters? They do exist, you know. We have for example My Hero Academia and Magi: they still manage to be funny even with some intelligent and complex female characters in the running.\\n\\n\r\nNow, over to sound\u2026 I did not like it, I did not dislike it. The opening was nothing more than mediocre. The ending\u2026 except for one time, I always skipped it, so it wasn\u2019t that good either. Sound effects were nothing special. Voice acting did fit the characters most of the time. It just really annoyed me when Aqua started screaming again \u2013 and again\u2026 and again.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is not worth mentioning either\u2026\\n\\n\r\nSo... If your looking for something that has been done a thousand time before and you really enjoy watching some stupid girl with tons of fanservice... this is the show for you.",

            "content": "After watching this, i was wondering for about a year... Why is this series so popular? \"How\" did it become so popular? When it's one of the most generic and most boring anime that has been released in the last 10 years. From the overall story to the animation, everything seems traced from every other fantasy anime, with the turn that this has comedy in it, but of course, the comedy is nothing from the other world, just plain comedy, and most of the time, you already knew when a joke was coming and what it was about. \r\nThe whole selling point of this wasdying and going to another world of your choice (nothing new at this point, keep in mind that every one is doing it right now) but in this case is more of a game, rather than transporting to a \"fantasy world\". The comedy was sometimes fun, and other times bothersome by how repetitive it was, and for some reason, the MC screaming was somewhat funny for a selected group of people. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, all of this can't be done without animation, but i don't really know if this series needed the animation, in the first place, while it felt a bit on purpose, it was horrible. From the characters moving, to what you get from a kid playing around with clay, deformed and the proportions wouldn't make any sense, but again, for some reason it felt like it was deliberately made that way, even nowadays Hentai series get better animation (Talk about being generous).\\n\\n\r\nSound it is hard to criticize as most anime have good audio, but it felt like there was 0 effort from the studio on putting the BGM in correct places. The seiyuu were a good choice, but the mc screaming all the time, is not something pleasing for anyone's ears. \\n\r\nWhile character development was ok for everyone, it felt \"dry\" or dull for anyone other than the MC, it felt slow paced, like if the only one of interest was the main chara when obviously the most interesting characters were the females. \\n\\n\r\nCan't really explain my enjoyment for this, it was boring and predictable, while at some times they got me off guard, the animation was a main flaw that made me drop the number a lot, i wouldn't personally recommend this, but seeing how popular it is, most people would've heard of this already. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 1\\n\r\nArt: 1\\n\r\nSound: 3\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\r\nOverall: 2\\n\\n\r\nAs always i'm sorry for any grammar error.",

            "content": "This anime is great. At first glance, looking at the setting of guy surrounded by cute girls in a dungeon RPG fantasy, it makes you think of Shitty Art Online, or maybe that Dungeon-something anime with the big-boobed goddess. But this, this is not like those sad excuses for animes. It was actually enjoyable, it was funny, it was entertaining, and you will rarely cringe or get bored while watching it. Main thing is, this is primarily a comedy anime, so if you're looking for a serious anime then this is not the anime for you.\r\nThe characters were really great. A tsukkomi protagonist is accompaniedby a full team of wackos, each of which have really interesting and funny design, character, and personalities.\\n\\n\r\nThe story... Doesn't take itself seriously. And well, it doesn't have to, since it better this way for this comedy anime. The \"main\" goal is to defeat the Devil King and stuff, but for most of the anime they were just mostly dealing with toads and cabbages and goofy villains. But at least they have actual progress from being newbies and they aren't OP from the start unlike some other RPG-style anime.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding fanservice. OH GOD(dess) STOP SHOWING AQUA'S BARE BUTTOCKS ALL THE TIME. Seriously this is my main irk with this anime, they have a character who has a very short skirt and doesn't wear underwear, and they like to show it all the time. But oh well aside from that, it's not as bad as other anime. There are few other generic ecchi scenes such as panty stealing and taking a bath together (both of which are actually hilarious), and some characters wear very skimpily, but for the main cast, aside from Aqua, it's not too distracting and irritating to the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is catchy and the ED is pretty great. The voice acting was on point with the characters and their quirky personalities.\\n\\n\r\nThe art leaves a lot to be desired, though. The designs of the most of the characters are good, but the animation sometimes fall flat and feel lazy and the faces occasionally look weird if you look closely. And the boobs. Fking hell if you want to include bouncing boobs at least make it look right. Aqua damn it.\\n\\n\r\nBut oh well. This anime is one to watch if you really want to laugh, if you want to see a quirky and entertaining main cast, if you're tired of all those other shitty RPG-based anime. It's short and has very little plot and mostly just comedy, but it's damn good at what it was mainly meant to do: make you laugh.",

Look no further than Sword Art Online if you want poor character development... Or watch this tasteful anime about a teenage boy named Kazuma Satou who shockingly dies and meets up with a god named Aqua. See gives him a chance to have an adventure in a parallel world. He also gets to take one thing, whether it is a weapon, ability or someone with him. Thinking hard he findsa loop hole and says to take the god herself to this world and it was granted. Both of them are sent to this new world and along the way they gain new allies to build a failure of a party.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was full of great laughs and failures which helped with all the characters development and allowed you to become to these characters. The art style and brilliant colours used throughout the series showed the happiest throughout the series, even though there wasn't actual enjoyment for Kazuma. The soundtrack and opening and ending songs also followed the continued trait of beating upbeat and happy.  \\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters were indeed troubled and no use in a real RPG game or even in this anime, from a god who was a sook but full of herself even though when it comes down to the line she is actually useful, to an all powerful mage which used explosion magic with one very huge draw back, she can only use it once..... And finally the proud and loyal knight who only join the team because she heard that Kazuma does unspeakable things to the other two members of his party.\\n\\n\r\nMy final comment is that this was a lot of fun to watch and I would definitively re watch this again and again.",

In fact, marvelous view of a fantasy world being how you never expected to be, seriously.\\n\r\nThe characters are awesome, each one with a simple characteristic that stand out and blending with others characters doing great gags (including the great CG and all the sound) for the anime.\\n\\n\r\n.-The cons: \\n\r\nThere are maybe a pair of chapters that the jokes are so off and a little dull, so could be tiresome.\\n\r\nThe anime cut some story of the novel so can end at the right time, it's not a danger call, but would had been good see the animation.",

            "content": "Are you tired of watching the same TV tropes being used over and over with barely any change whatsoever? Angry from watching the seemingly infinite amount of uninspiring harems that flood the new seasons? Bored from watching spineless protagonists that have as much personality as a 2D cardboard cutout? Well then my friend, KonoSuba is the show for you!\r\n\tThe story follows Satou Kazuma, an Otaku and gamer who dies trying to save a girl. He ends up in front of a rude goddess called Aqua who gives him the choice between going to heaven or going intoa MMO like world filled with adventures and stuff. Of course our protagonist chooses the latter and Blah Blah, you know what happens.\\n\\n\r\n\tNow you might start shaking your head and giving me a weird look, and I don\u2019t blame you. The concept of an otaku shut-in being transported into a magical world is a concept that makes me want to slam my head in the wall. The cover of the show with three rather attractive ladies and an average looking protagonist in the back is probably enough to steer many people away. But there is a legitimate reason for this. KonoSuba is a parody of these clich\u00e9s that it portrays. Much of the humor in KonoSuba is based on using our expectations of what happens based on the tropes that it contains and defying those expectations completely in hilarious ways.\\n\\n\r\n\tAnd that is probably a big part of the reason why KonoSuba is so enjoyable. It never takes itself seriously. You know those shows that start off great but end up having those really sad and melodramatic parts that just end up leaving a bad taste in your mouth? Well KonoSuba has none of that. KonoSuba recognizes that it\u2019s a silly show, and instead of trying to add anything unnecessary. It plays to its strength. Which is to be as outrageously silly as possible.\\n\\n\r\n\tSpeaking of being truly, truly, outrageous, (wink) let\u2019s talk about our cast of characters here. You have Aqua, a rude goddess that is forced to join Kazuma in his quest to defeat the Demon King. Megumin, an arch wizard who channels the power of one of the strongest magical spells in the game, Darkness, a crusader who can help you tank all of the damage coming, and Kazuma, your normal adventurer.\\n\\n\r\n\tBut how is this outrageous? The cast seems pretty normal right? Well what if I said that instead of being this smart, prideful tsundere Aqua is actually a nice but dense girl who always manages to fuck everything up in one way or another? Or what about our adorable chuunibyou arch wizard Megumin, who can only cast \u201cExplosion\u201d magic once a day and ends up being unable to move a muscle after? Don\u2019t forget our valiant crusader, a complete masochist who charges to the front line to get hit and harassed as much as she can. You get what I mean. \\n\\n\r\n\tSurprisingly though, this oddball cast really works great together. Whether it\u2019s the hilarious antics that are set up, or just the chemistry between the characters. The relationship between the cast just feels natural and there isn\u2019t any forced progression anywhere. No hint of any of the girls inexplicably falling in love with Kazuma. You might realize that I didn\u2019t talk about Kazuma much but he is definitely a refreshing male lead to watch. Except it\u2019s not because he\u2019s crazy but because he actually acts like an actual rational human being. Risking your life to beat the Demon King? Fuck that I just want enough money to live a comfortable life. Having a convenient lie to cover yourself up from something embarrasing? Don\u2019t mind if I do.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe animation of this show is quite interesting to say the least. On one hand you have scenes that are drawn with great care, and on the other you have many crudely drawn scenes. Very strangely though, I didn\u2019t really find those scenes to hinder my enjoyment of the show and in some cases I felt like it fit in with the show fine. Hell, KonoSuba might actually be poking fun at other shows that have beautifully designed characters. Considering the amount of things KonoSuba pokes fun at. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe most prominent part of the art though is definitely the facial expressions. I\u2019ll say this right now. KonoSuba has some of the most hilarious expressions that I have ever seen in anime. From the mischievous expressions from Aqua to the nervous expressions of Kazuma. These expressions really bring the show to life and serve to make the show much funnier than normal. I\u2019m being serious here. If KonoSuba had average facial expressions. The show wouldn\u2019t be half as good as it is now.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe music was fine for the most part. The soundtrack doesn\u2019t really stand out and that\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t need Jun Maeda levels of tracks for a show like this. The opening is pretty upbeat and I actually had a good time with it, actually choosing not to skip it. The ending is this calm, soothing song helmed by the girls in the cast. I also really liked it for some inexplicable reason.\\n\\n\r\n\tKonoSuba isn\u2019t really anything revolutionary and its mostly just there for laughs. But KonoSuba excels so much in comedy that I really did find the need to write a review for it so people don\u2019t miss this gem. Trust me, if you are tired of many of the tropes that you see in anime and adventure shows then chances are you\u2019ll fit right in with KonoSuba. So what are you waiting for? Tired after a long day of work? Frustrated from homework that you have to finish? Pop up an episode of KonoSuba, and proceed to laugh your ass off.\\n",

            "content": "The best way to describe Konosuba is one trick pony. If the comedy doesn't do it for you, you will probably hate this show. Now occasionally it was funny, but the repetitive nature of Konosuba will wear you down and it's not like anything about the humor changes, just the situation. Admittedly, it was only funny during certain situations which is a problem for Konosuba stemming from it's foundation. Without anything to build on, the show can appear bland at times without the comedy. \r\nUnfortunately, there\u2019s no backbone to the story. The show takes an episodic approach for a simple underlying theme of friendship andwackiness. Now Konosuba has some charm to it, each character meshes and the setting is somewhat diverse, but it\u2019s hard to immerse oneself into the world. When everything comes off as a joke, it\u2019s hard to be impressed by the somewhat clever storytelling. Right off the bat from the first 10 minutes of the first episode, I knew this show would be a joke in itself, but scary thing is it could\u2019ve been okay. The biggest problem with Konosuba is the same thing that can make it good. It suffers from a prison school like parody skit based \u201ccomedic\u201d heavy trope. Episodic nature of the story may also hinder anyone from getting attached to the setting and conflict. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters have flare to them. A bright spot in this show are the characters, which have personality and their own charm. When I said the characters mesh, they have a decent chemistry together and isn\u2019t as stagnant, especially with the 1:3 ratio of boy to girl. Interactions aren\u2019t focused on blushing, touchy, teasing blah blah that many shows suffer from. It\u2019s not cringy to watch like some shows, but the characters are lacking in resolve. Their half hearted at best and unlikable, especially aqua. It\u2019s a shame because they suffer from the episodic sequence and storytelling. Their not as impactful as they could be, even if it is all a joke. Also pacing hurts the show by having awful side characters that leave a lot to be desired. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound are pretty cool, a lot of vibrant colors that match the mood in a given scene and the color palette of each character fits who they are, whatever that means. Sound is good too, not as upbeat as I would like in a fantasy but its relaxing. Also adds to the comedy.\\n\\n\r\nKonosuba was a weird show to watch and especially critique. I can\u2019t tell if I like it or not; it has no hook but it keeps me hooked, it\u2019s not funny but it\u2019s funny, and characters are so dissatisfying but real. I was hoping in the back of my mind that it would become a harem, perhaps indirectly, but it\u2019s better how it was than if it was a harem. The foundation of the show is comedy and that makes or breaks it. I believe it\u2019s both its strong and weak points, but for those who are into occasionally funny innuendos, look no further as this is an above average comedy, however a below average piece of fiction. Eye of the beholder is subject to subjectiveness.\\n",

            "content": "Anime is a production. \r\nAs of late, there are few genres of anime (aside from the ever popular time travel) that I've seen take off as much as the MMO/Fantasy RPG/Living inside a video game. 2014 had more SAO, \"No Game No Life\" and \"Log Horizon\", 2015 had such hits as \"Is It Wrong To Try To Pick Up Girls In A Dungeon?\" (Danmachi), \"Overlord\", and \"Bikini Warriors\". Given that many anime consumers in Japan (keep in mind, this is who anime is made for, despite the odd trend to the contrary) also consume video games- it makes sense from a demographic and market shareperspective- offer your audience something they can relate to and find engaging. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a tried and true method of marketing, and just like sex, video game themed anime sells. \\n\r\nThe next step in selling your product, after you've figured out what you're going to make, is to differentiate it; because, let's face it, these anime are so manufactured and soulless that they were made by a committee of suits, just like horror movie sequels and Disney. So, you've gotta find a gag, since we've all seen what happens when you play it straight: SAO. \\n\r\nAs far as I've seen, you've got about 3 choices: fanservice, humor, or some combination of the two. Overlord went the humor route in depicting a ridiculously overpowered MC in an underpowered game. Danmachi went full fanservice and showed off nothing but ridiculously overdone T&A. Where does Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo fall on this? Somewhere roughly in the middle, along with Bikini Warriors, which sold out on BOTH extreme fanservice and humor. \\n\\n\r\nAllow me to explain, Kono Subarashii takes a very self aware and 4th wall breaking style of humor in its setting- a nameless NEET dies in the stupidest way possible- dying of shock after buying a new video game, and in return gets reincarnated into a fantasy world he hopes will be like the game he never got to play. As it turns out, life in the fantasy world isn't all T&A (but there's a lot of that anyway). \\n\\n\r\nI'm watching Kono Subarashii, and wondering what people liked about it so much. The comedy is hit or miss, as with most MMO themed shows (depending on if you've played the specific game or experienced the scenarios in RPG games the characters run into), but it's just a cast of cardboard cutouts with no personality to speak of, acting like the median character archetype they're based on. Like, even Bikini Warriors managed that, and it was like 3 minutes per episode. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter archetype list: \\n\r\nYou've got the wisecracking sarcastic shaggy hair NEET MC who knows everything about how the game functions, or should function. Can't suffer his idiotic teammates, but of course, is also a horny bastard. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's the arrogant, bitchy character who's actually an idiot and completely useless other than running their mouth, crying, and getting in the way for the sake of humor. \\n\\n\r\nWhat's an anime without another useless airhead character? Oh, and make them a cute little girl, because you need lolis. \\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the token female masochist character that tries to elbow your ribs with the completely punchless erotic jokes that wear thin within 5 minutes of their appearance. This character type is only moderately better than the spicy red head tsundere archetype who gets violent with the MC for no reason and the big tits loli dumbass. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI'm pretty sure Bikini Warriors did exactly this, in 20 less minutes of runtime. In fact, Bikini Warriors does do this, and does it better. For a 3 minute short to be effective, you have to be very focused and get the point out there, quickly. They did exactly that: pick one poignant video game humor joke, like repeatedly getting the same loot, armor that looks exactly the same, but better, pot smashing, dumb AI, etc and making that the focus of the episode amid a flood of pointless fanservice. Bikini Warriors borders on hentai at times, but the jokes land in the crosswind, and it's actually funny. \\n\\n\r\nKono Subarashii tries to use these same jokes- grinding endlessly for a pittance of money, ineffective equipment or spells, useless teammates, etc and they work at times... but their reiterative feel and how similarly each episode plays out kills the effect- Kazuma wants to get money, accept quest, some weird combination of fudgery allows them to complete it, Aqua messes it up and costs the team all their money, (or some variant on that, rinse, repeat). Bikini Warriors didn't wear as thin because it was a short burst, but Kono Subarashii just doesn't have enough content to fill out a 23 minute episode, although this may be a shortcoming of the studio Deen for not effectively adapting the LNs... as they're known for their crap quality in 2016. \\n\\n\r\nThe last two episodes were the highlight of the show, honestly. The whorehouse part was actually funny- because they played up the gamer humor AND the fanservice in an acceptable way that wasn't just shoved in for no reason. That succubus episode would have been filler in literally any other show, but in the effectively all filler, no progression SOL style of Kono Subarashii, it takes the cake as the cream of the pants. I mean, crop.\\n\r\nIt's not fair to rate a largely episodic comedy series on how it progresses plots or characters, but at least the overarching plot is addressed, even if it's for the sake of humor- as in, \"lol we're never going to reach our goal of finishing this adventure, because we SUCK!\" \\n\r\nThe last episode wasn't bad either, if entirely predictable. It's always nice to see the idiosyncrasies of the ragtag group of characters finally work out the way it's supposed to, even with all their blunders. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I have to say that even as a former MMORPG player, I have never really been a fan of the presentation of it in series form... the potential for humor is there, if you can harness the memories/nostalgia of mutual experience among the audience... and while I \"GET\" the jokes, and I \"GET\" that humor is subjective, I'm also the target audience for this kind of show, and I just didn't find it that funny. But, there are certainly worse ways to blow 23 minutes.",

            "content": "SOME SPOILERS AHEAD.\r\n This is the first time I write a review and I am doing it only because this anime deserves it. Thanks to it, I will also review other anime. \r\nThis is just to let you know to give this thing a shot. I basically never stopped laughing. Specially with the ep 8 (or 9) about Kazuma, the succubus and Darkness (our perverted masochist knight! Lalatina!)\r\nKazuma is the best MC of the season. He is not the righteous guy and he gives in to his desires (he is going to make history with the city's succubus thanks to that). He is not thetype to follow rules (you will see that when he is challenged in a duel for Aqua, where he shamelessly attacked first and knocked the enemy with his sword that he stole). \\n\\n\r\nHe is NOT dense. I repeat, NOT DENSE. This is shown a number of times, like at the end when he is asked by Wiz (our lich) if she 'can suck it out' (the way she said it can create A LOT of misunderstandings) and he immediately answered 'yes' and argues with himself that in cases like this he is not stupid or dense enough to ask the cliche 'W-what do you mean?!'. He just gives in. \\n\\n\r\nYou can compare him with our cool MC from Trinity Seven, Magic King Arata. They both are perverted and not dense.\\n\\n\r\nHis companions are funny! The goddess Aqua, the masochist Darkness, and the explosive Mugumi (I am not sure how it is spelled). \\n\\n\r\nThere wasn't any crucial advance in the main story that is to kill the Demon King. They did kill Dulahan but the poor guy did nothing to deserve it... \\n\\n\r\nI am sure that in the next season which is already confirmed there will be advancement in the story.\\n\\n\r\nStory 6/10\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n",

            "content": "Okay... Hey everybody! I'll be writing my second review, and this time its on the wonderful anime known as Kono Subarashii Sekai Ni Shukufuku Wo!.\r\nStory - 4/10\r\nOkay, so I'm not gonna let this really affect the overall, because the show is just a comedy set in an adventure world, so its not necessary to have adventuring, killing monsters, blah blah blah. But putting that aside, if this were an actual adventure I would rate it especially low. The story (At least at the beginning) follows Satou Kazuma, (Husbandoof2016) a shut in Hikikomori who one day, on his way back from buying a video game, seesa girl about to get run over by a truck. He bravely pushes the girl outta the way and he is killed in the process. (Cliche much?) When Kazuma wakes up, he finds himself in the afterlife. An annoying goddess named Aqua allows Kazuma to anything he wants and gets reincarnated into a fantasy world. Our hero, Kazuma chooses Aqua, but he realized that he had made a big mistake. Aqua is useless!\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason, (and I really didn't pay attention to the animation so thats outta here) I really enjoyed the characters art style. I wasn't that much of a fan of the Season 2 art style, but HEY! We're talking about Season 1 here, OK? I might have pretty bad eyes and all, but the (few) fight scenes that were in the show felt very well done and flowing. The art compared to many other shows is much lower, but take a bigger budget and Konosuba would be doing great!\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in Konosuba was soooo well done. Each character sounded like they were actually feeling that way, like whenever Kazuma screamed, Aqua cried, Darkness being a masochist, and Megumin going EXPLOSION! The OPs and EDs were all quite nice to listen too, and I can't remember skipping either of them ever.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nHere in KonoSuba, we have a completely unique set of MCs. A powerful arch wizard who can only fire 1 explosion, and then collapse. A crusader who can't hit anything and is an extreme masochist. A goddess who is a whiny brat and can't do anything herself. And of course, our perverted hero who greatly dislikes his harem, Kazuma. They all had their funny scenes and no matter how many times I rewatched Konosuba, I always found everything they said funny. Kazuma became one of my favorite characters due to the fact he was a harem protagonist who didn't just have his own personality, but an actual interesting and funny personality. STEAL!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAll of Konosubas running gags and all the jokes never seemed to get old. Hai, Kazuma Des. Konosuba really showed to me it wasn't just some lame ecchi fanservice-based harem anime with a boring protagonist. Konosuba was just genuinely funny, and I enjoyed the hell outta that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba is one of those anime where nobody actually cares about the plot. ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) Its just, many people will lower their ratings due to the fact that Konosuba has little to no plot at all. WAKE UP! KonoSuba isn't an adventure show. If you're bored or looking for a good laugh, watch Konosuba. Trust me, you won't regret it! KONOSUBA!",

            "content": "\"Konosuba is like that one comedian that makes some really satisfying jokes, but then drills some of the weaker material into the ground before getting drenched in rotten tomatoes until finally doing something new at the end.\" -Me, whenever you read this.\r\nIt seems as if an anime critic's mortal enemy isn't a badly written original story or even a story that is cliched to the bone, but rather Light Novels/Light Novel anime adaptations and Isekai (taken to a fantasy world) series. LNs and their adaptations often consist of a plain or terrible main character surrounded by two-dimensional love interests for his harem, in which hesaves them constantly while fighting poorly done battles in a horribly written narrative, making it so that it was inevitable for a series to subvert and play around with those typical trappings (like Chivalry of a Failed Knight, which started out as a Light Novel) or mock what this type of series has become. Meanwhile, Isekai series (which are often Light Novels/LN anime adaptations) generally feature a NEET/Hikikomori protagonist that is randomly summoned into a bland fantasy world for some purpose while being surrounded by a weak cast of characters driven along by a poorly made plot that often relies on desperately trying to make jabs or references about its lifeblood, making it so that it was inevitable for a series toe subvert and play around with those typical trappings or mock what type of series this has become, like our current target, KonoSuba (which started out as a Light Novel). So, did this series succeed at providing satisfying jabs at what it mocks without becoming as bad as what it mocked? Well, if you looked at my score, you know the answer, but let's pretend you didn't, and with that, let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nA NEET named Kazuma dies a hilariously stupid death and is sent by Aqua to a fantasy world because he decided to choose that rather than just ending everything for him there. Since Aqua was so rude to him all the while, he manages to trick her into coming along. Thus, he forms a \"ragtag team\" and his \"quest\" begins. Ultimately, the plot goes nowhere, aside from showing us who Kazuma is gonna adventure with, and showing a fraction of what army will truly oppose him in the future. They start in this beginner town, and they stay there by the end of the season. It is a fairly episodic series as well, with only minor things, like a change of living space, carrying from episode to episode. The plot isn't important here, as it is one big prologue that makes fun of Isekai shows (and even Isekai-like shows like SAO) and makes use of how it feels like an RPG with how each mission starts and concludes. I do wish it went somewhere, or at least, showed a bit more of our villains (maybe even give us a glimpse onto what our villain is like or what he/she even looks like). A minor complaint is that, when Megumin (who I will talk about later) blasts a knight's castle for weeks on end, it takes weeks for him ton bother trying to address the issue, instead of, right away, like a smart person would. Plus, there is this time-skip in episode 8 that makes the context of the introduction of a character named Wiz, awkward, no matter how they went about it. Still, it's not the story that is at fault here. It's the characters. Speaking of...\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist, Kazuma, is a NEET who is constantly fed up by his cohorts' antics, and has to deal with everyone's crap, which is why he revels in each chance to spite them, especially Aqua (who I'll get to). Ultimately, he has the most personality in this series as of this season, and is he only one that remains decent by the end of the series (aside from Wiz, who is pretty beautiful, fearful and clumsy around Aqua given how much Aqua tries to kill her, and kicks the most ass out of everyone in the show). I honestly feel bad for him given the 3 characters he has to deal with, but he is at the forefront of the funniest moment in the show: when he uses the steal technique to steal a thief girl's panties and waves it gloriously.\\n\\n\r\nIn order of descending appearance (there is a reason for this), Darkness is the second most one-dimensional character here, with her only two traits being a perverted sense of masochism (which is run into the ground pretty quick) and her stubborn sense of self-sacrifice in knighthood. Those are the only two things to her for most part; she does have her limits, as shown in episode 9, but her beauty can't save her from being annoyingly one-note. Megumin is also pretty lame, with her one major trait being her love and pridefulness of her EXPLOSION magic, which wears out rather quick. It's also discomforting how she lusts her magic staff at points. She is also the subject of occasional sexual gags (accidentally), but, again, there isn't much to her aside from the one personality trait she has, so her charm peters out towards the end, aside from the small growth at the end. Doesn't mean she wasn't fun in the first 6 episode, especially that explosion montage.\\n\\n\r\nAqua, is a pathetic, pretentious, pompous, arrogant, stupid, demanding, self-serving, uncaring, and infuriating bitch who I cannot stand for the life of me! The joke is: she's a bitch, so here's how much it bites her whiny ass and makes her cry like what she is (do you really need me to call her that again?). However, she goes over-the-top n terms of making every scene worse for almost every character involved, especially Kazuma. When you want to make your character funny while pathetic and awful, you need to take special care in making sure that she doesn't cross the line and instead shows us on the occasion, why we should put up with her, and while they manage do the latter twice (which leads to funny moments that make everything worse for Kazuma and his money), they fail horribly at doing the latter, with her sheer stupidity and arrogance being a bother. Yet, while hearing her bawl like what she is, is funny the first few times, the actual crying is still annoying to the point where it loses the cathartic charm she has. She is a pathetically hateful and one-dimensional character that actively makes the show worse, and her good looks can't help her here. Her treatment of Wiz in episode 8 is particularly disgusting, and is the moment where I truly hated this wench, more so than any other female character I have seen to date.\\n\\n\r\nWith Kazuma's 3 female companions, I get that the joke is that they have flat personalities as if they were like the class archetypes like archmage or paladin, but, the joke wears out horrifically quickly, and the show makes no attempt at shaking it up. It is the same tired punch line over and over again, and that becomes a detriment to the characters and the show, since they never twist these characters into gold, but rather, make them as dry as the types of characters the show is mocking, and, surprise surprise, it makes them terrible characters. I mean, the 3 ladies are funny the first few times, and Kazuma can give us some hilarious scenes, but the joke gets old after episode 6. As for the rest (aside from the beautiful Wiz, who I covered), there is Kyouya (a joke on Kirito from SAO) and his two girl who kiss his ass the whole way through, Luna (the voluptuous quest-giver), and a few other minute characters only there for quick gags or whatnot that aren't even worth mentioning by name. All-in-all, a pretty lame cast of mostly one-dimensional characters that often fail at being cathartic rips on their counterparts.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nStudio DEEN isn't known for great art, and this isn't the best of exceptions (Rakugo came out this year and overall, looks and IS much better), with the rugged character models and certain faces at times, but the facial expressions at other times can be downright hilarious (like when Aqua realizes she's been tricked in episode 1 and when she shakes Kazuma while crying in the same episode). Also, the level up things and the magic (EXPLOSION) were done so dam well, and they're so vibrant. Too bad the CGI contraption in the finale was awkward to look at. I also like the touches on the quest jokes.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP, fantastic dreamer, by Machico, is pretty annoying to me with the vocals, but otherwise doesn't stand out. The ED, Chiisana Boukensha, by the seiyuus of the 3 main ladies, doesn't stand out either. In fact, the entire OST is pretty forgettable to me. I don't remember a single track in this OST, aside from the song used for the EXPLOSION magic. Nothing was bad per se, but I wish I got something I could remember aside from a bunch of music that was just...there...\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first 4 episodes were a riot. The highlight of the show was when Kazuma was laughing while twirling the thief's panties in front of her. GLORIOUS!!  Hell, episode 6 had that funny EXPLOSION montage. The first 4 episodes has satisfying jokes that felt endearing and refreshing. Then, episode 5 came and annoyed me, and then, by episode 8, the show's fate was sealed, thanks to the girls becoming highly repetitive and grating, and Aqua being the most insufferable character I've ever seen, especially in episode 8 with her treatment of Wiz. Episode 7 was aggravating too, but NOTHING in episode 8 worked for me, and episode 9 felt discomforting and tedious as well. Sure, the finale was sort of funny and satisfying, but by that point, the damage had been done.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 5/10    RAW SCORE: 54/100\\n\\n\r\nThis show felt pretty funny at first, but for most of the things mentioned above, the show lost its luster and grew grating and stale until the final episode finally decided to change things up. Episodes 6-8 felt like repetitive filer that added nothing but infuriation to me, with how much it made me hate Aqua, and for how repetitive most characters felt. It made me feel like Kazuma (the guy who puts up with BS with his teeth clenched and his gorge rising), and in a show like this, you NEVER want to make the audience feel that way. Still, can't say there wasn't a good amount of merit here. Despite my qualms, this show felt hardy and genuine. Doesn't mean that the act got old, and that's easily the show's biggest sin. The shtick gets old, and only at the end do they try to spice it up again. Well, with that said, I bid you adieu before the EXPLOSION of backlash rolls in from Konosuba and Megumin fans alike.",

The whole story is how the main character is surrounded by horny bitches, one is dumb, the other is a tsundere and the third is a perverted masochist freak that wants to be humiliated and fucked all the time. It's disgusting.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 1 (there is no story)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6 (I guess it looks OK, but then again that is hardly important for an anime)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6 (who cares how the sound is as long as you hear the characters' voices and effects)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1 (there is no development and all the characters look and feel very unrealistic - the main character used to be a loser with no social experience, now bitches are flocking from all the continent to stay with him, because he's suddenly cool for no apparent reason. And these bitches' characters are all the same to each other, they are also overused archetypes in many anime, nothing original about them)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1 (there was no option 0, so I had to pick 1)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3 (the two 6 for Art and Sound make it look like it's not that bad, but overall it's a horrible and overrated anime that I do not understand why is it so popular when it's so retarded and nothing happens in it)",

            "content": "Konusoba is very popular this season, and I see it being recommended left right and sideways. For this reason I am actually taking the time to write my first review of an anime. Normally I don't have strong opinions on any anime, but this show's reception has been so completely against the grain of my thoughts on it I felt like I'd throw in my 2 cents.\r\nMinor spoilers below but it shouldn't matter because the show is so predictable you can't spoil anything.\r\nLets start with the characters. The MC is your standard 'just came out of the cookie cutter' NEET. He plays video games, he'sa nice guy, he can't seem to get a break, and he's prone to misunderstandings and awkward circumstances. They really took a lot of risks with this guy's character I'll tell ya! Also he's a pervert. Shocker.\\n\\n\r\nEvery single other major character in the story is female and serves to be made fun of as sexual objects. Every single instance of plot between MC and the lead lady takes the form of her being portrayed as a money wasting useless person. Her personality traits are being spineless, being whiny, wasting money, and getting drunk.\\n\\n\r\nThe other female characters all serve as the butt ends of jokes over and over again. Except the only two jokes they make are 'this little girl likes explosion magic and its inefficient, haha!' and 'this other chick is a masochist, haha!'\\n\\n\r\nThats it. Thats the show folks. It's a perfect rotation of:\\n\\n\r\nMC boy has something unfortunate happen to him!\\n\\n\r\nLead lady does something greedy and is portrayed as a money waster!\\n\\n\r\nFollowed by one of the two supporting ladies being portrayed as a sexual object, generally in the form of their panties or them doing something stupid. Rinse and repeat for 20 minutes an episode. HAHAHAHA COMEDY GOLD.\\n\\n\r\nThats all this show has to it. There's no sustenance, there's no real plot, the MC gets thrown into this whole new world and we have yet to even see any world building involved. We have no idea what the world looks like, what the rules are here, and etc. Which brings us to the writing.\\n\\n\r\nLets talk about Konu's writing, or lack thereof?\\n\\n\r\nSometimes, the world goes by video game rules. Sometimes its just a normal world. The line is so blurry it doesnt exist, and the writers randomly throw in video game rules that never existed before.\\n\\n\r\nThere are times when they suddenly mention \"Oh I levelled up!\" when the principle of exp/exp grinding/levels was NEVER MENTIONED BEFORE IN THE PLOT. Wat?\\n\\n\r\nThe MCs spend the first episode working a real job and making cash in order to get by, then once they switch into adventuring mode because the writers said so. And yet, at a certain point in the plot they lose the ability to go on adventures, and become strapped for cash.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of going back to working normal jobs, they just... do nothing and complain about the lack of funds. Despite the fact 4 episodes later it was made evident manual labor pays more than well enough for them to get by and blow money on booze every night, suddenly the act of going on 2 adventures means going back temporarily to manual labor isn't a possibility. So much so that they don't even address this.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't even a 'What if we just went back to work our old jobs?' 'No way! We'll have to think of something else!' convo. It's just glazed right over because, that would actually be a real solution to the problem as opposed to the plot that follows...\\n\\n\r\nThe writing is full of terrible writing like this. Nothing makes sense, the rules are often made up on the spot and never mentioned previously, then discarded once done with and never mentioned again.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art, its got nothing special going. It looks about the same as all the other meh anime out these last few years and has nothing glamorous going on. There are even a decent chunk of magical girl style scenes frequently reused to shave down the budget.\\n\\n\r\nSame goes for sound. The music isn't particularly enthralling and feels about as generic as everything else in this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it a 5/10. This show is exactly what I expected it to be. A cash grab at the ever growing in popularity 'Guy gets stuck in a video game' genre. Except unlike SAO this show has no art to ride on the back of, and unlike NGNL and friends this show has no writing to speak for either.\\n\\n\r\nThey took the model of the other successful shows in the genre, ripped them off, cheaped out on art/directing/writing/music/sound and just threw sexual innuendos and panties at it and... it worked. Everyone is eating this crock up for breakfast.\\n\\n\r\nWhich makes me embarrassed to see happen.",

            "content": "Konosuba is a very carefree adventure story about an oddball cast of misfits who travel together to beat the \"big, bad boss\". While there's a bit more to the story (which I won't spoil), the general plot is that a free-roaming RPG; the characters travel doing quests for money, causing trouble, and fighting monsters. Sometimes they even win. It's purely a comedy, nothing is taken seriously in this show, ever. If I had to say something good about Konosuba it would be the voice acting. Alongside superb character personalities, the accompanying VA's do a fantastic job of getting the viewer to know the characters. Theart has a very nice touch to it, while it isn't exactly 3-D friendly, the art has a way of showing the character's many expressions and conveying emotions very well. The world setting for the show is highly detailed, with many creative locations and terrain that is visually pleasing. The comedy is consistently entertaining despite a bit of repetitiveness. If I had to say something bad about Konosuba it would be that the show is artistically lacking in many categories: the story itself seems to be aimless, no meaningful events seem to occur at all. Lines have little to no depth, with many forgettable scenes. While the main cast is very consistent, the side/supporting characters are very weak. Many clich\u00e9 or one-dimensional supporting characters fail to interact well with the main cast. There's a lot to like about the show if you're looking for a fun comedic series, but if you're looking for a great (deep) story look elsewhere. Favorite characters: Aqua/Megumin/Darkness(\u2665) I give it a 9.3/10.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR version: Silly comedy with great cast/setting/art. Not much else beyond that.",

            "content": "DISCLAIMER: This version is outdated, however I will keep it up here as a mark for my first seasonal anime review. There will be a redux version of this review coming soon where it contains my new opinion about the series as well as improved spelling and grammar. Regardless of that feel free to enjoy my now outdated review for it!\r\nHey, everyone TheCodeTrigger and welcome too my next anime review.\r\nFor this one we are taking a look at the Winter 16 anime KonoSuba.\r\nKonoSuba was directed by Kanasaki, Takaomi and it consists of 10 episodes airing from Jan 14, 2016 too, Mar 17, 2016.\r\nWith that outthe way, let's get started.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins where our main lead Kazuma whom got killed by a tractor while rescuing a girl in the progress. Then Kazuma wakes up in the afterlife where Aqua gives Kazuma an offer of where he can start a new life in a real RPG and from theyre Kazuma begins his new life as an adventure in an RPG setting as he gains experience and levels up like in an RPG game so he can defeat the boss at the end.\\n\\n\r\nNow the story of KonoSuba are great because it really sets up the world really nicely with Kazuma are slowly adapting too his new life RPG life as he leaves are own world aka earth as he's more character on the way like the really overpowered explosive magic user Mequin too the sloppy but tankly darkness.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that I really liked in the story are the jokes sure some of the jokes can a miss but least for this type of show are unique and it has that strong Slayers vibe when it comes too jokes and its similar pacing.\\n\\n\r\nAlso theyre are some really great sex humour on this like the having the magic power of stealing panties. This show are kinda weird but same it knows how too execute its humour really well without being cringe-worthy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story are good for what it are.\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in KonoSuba were surprisingly really good and they were executed.\\n\\n\r\nKazuma isn't youre overpowered main protagonist, in fact, he starts off very weak in his new world and as the season progressed he becomes a more friendlier guy while still being a dumbass in the process.\\n\\n\r\nNext are Aqua whom are the goddess of water. She has the potential too do lots of damage too her opponents however like a another character that am about too mention some of her actions can really bite her in the ass because some of the things that Aqua does leads too more harm than good.\\n\\n\r\nShe are more as the circus type character because she rather do a show then actually support the group.\\n\\n\r\nLeast Aqua are not of those useless girls because at times she can be funny but at the same time she's slightly annoying for my taste.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I personalty like Aqua but not as much as the other character that am going too mention and also I can understand why people hate Aqua and it\u2019s for a very good reason.\\n\\n\r\nMequin are that explosive girl that likes too blow things up with her magic.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally she are my favourite charters in this show because she had the opportunity too learn all sorts of different spells but she usually just goes for the more explosive spells. She's reminds of Lina Inverse due too her explosive nature.\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing that I really adore her are her overpowerness as well as the side effect. You see in most RPG/JRPG games where you use a really powerful spell that do massive damage but same thing if you mess up or do it incorrectly you will either waste some of youre mana or become frozen up doing nothing while the enemies attack you for free.\\n\\n\r\nThis happens here because at certain point in this show where she a rage doll after she over uses her overpowered magic and trust it can lead too some really hilarious scenes.\\n\\n\r\nLina and Mequin would make a perfect magic explosive duo in my opinion ^_^\\n\\n\r\nOverall Mequin are really amazing character and easily one of my favourite anime girls in anime.\\n\\n\r\nLastly we have Darkness whom are a knight.\\n\\n\r\nNow out of all the characters she are the weakest of the bunch fighting wise but she can tank like a boss.\\n\\n\r\nHowever she are my least favourite character of the bunch because no offence but she are just theyre for fan-service most of the time but hey least she's not like Hestia from Damnachi where she useless and she just theyre for fap material for the horny 12 years out theyre no offence.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are just fine too support the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this character cast are good.\\n\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation.\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba was done by Studio Deen. The same studio that gave Shouwa, Fruits Basket and Fate Stay Night (2006).\\n\\n\r\nThe art itself are definitely the weakest part of KonoSuba. The scenery looks beautiful by itself but the character designs can get really messy at times especially they faces. Some may say its adds the humor but at times It can be really distracting at times. I liked the custom designs of the main cast because its makes the characters look more appealing in the world that they are in. Also, KonoSuba has some fan-service which are surprisingly tolerable here and it not too, distracting unlike some other fantasy/RPG base anime looking at you Sword Art Online...\\n\\n\r\n6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI found the animation too be really good and defiantly one of the best Deen works in the terms of animation because up too recently Deen are not known for smooth animation for example Fate Stay Night 2006. But at times like the art it can be a bit choppy at times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the Animation are great for Deen standards.\\n\\n\r\n 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST for Konosuba has that MMORPG feel. Some tracks which at this time of the review I will mention any tracks because the official OST of Konosuba are yet too be release. The OST, in general, are a massive step up from Danmachi because unlike Danmachi Konosuba are more of the party feel because of the tracks that they presented too us are more MMORPG based.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme called Fantastic Dreamers done by Machico. Surprising its a really great song. My personal favourite anime opening of Winter 16 ^_^\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba Opening Full Fantastic Dreamers\\n\\n\r\nThe Ending Theme are called Chiisana Boukensha which was sang by the main 3 female characters Aqua, Megumin and Raratina Dustiness Ford. I personally loved the ending theme because it so relaxing and it has that RPG feel too it. Chiisana Bokukensha has become one of my favourite anime ending themes period.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately at this time of the review, theyre are no English dub announced. Hopefully, Konosuba will get a dub sometime in the future because I found the comedy in this series too be hilarious and having the English Dub would make this series funnier in my option.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt's has that Slayers feel too it because of the whole party system and as well of the humour and comedy.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also knows how too use fan service property unlike in most fantasy anime you see nowadays *cough Danmachi/SAO*.\\n\\n\r\nI like the OST a lot because it beings life too the world.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the RPG world that the story takes place because it\u2019s such a nice and interesting world.\\n\\n\r\nToo, bad it ended early with only 10 episodes but hey theyre are a S2 coming out soon and I hope it will be least 26 episodes Slayers style tbh.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba ended up being a wonderful experience. Even with its lacklustre art and a few animation derps. The comedy and the characters were well executed and it made me forget the issues that I had with the art. This are easily my second favourite anime from the winter 16 seasons.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this show too anyone whom are looking for a good RPG based anime.\\n\\n\r\nI give KonoSuba a 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAnime Recommendations.\\n\\n\r\nSlayers.\\n\\n\r\nLog Horizon.\\n\\n\r\nRune Solider\\n\\n\r\nHai too, Gensou no Grimgar\\n\\n\r\nNow after my next review which going too be Erased.\\n\\n\r\n I will be reviewing anime that have the highest votes on that the poll that I did on certain Facebook groups.\\n\\n\r\nUntil then has been TheCodeTrigger and I will see you guys next time.",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Kono Subarashii sekai ni shufuku wo. This was a very entertaining anime, and I cannot wait for a second season. If you like fantasy themes and comedy I would recommend giving this one a shot. \r\nThe story revolves around a man who died and is reincarnated in an alternate universe where life is much like an RPG game. However life in this new world isn't as he expected. He doesn't have amazing abilities and the friends he makes early in the show are all weird and nearly useless. The story revolves mostly around his daily life andthe struggles he faces in this new world.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was superb. Animation was fluid, great effects and great characters. The soundtrack fit well but wasn't anything I need to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great. Our male lead is Satou, Kazuma. Satou was a shut in teenager in japan who died and is revived in this new world. He plays the role of the straight man for most of the comedy bits and is likable. Then we have the three girls who join his party. First we have Aqua who is a goddess who was taken with Satou to this world do to the perks you get for reincarnation. She isn't very intelligent but is very arrogant which makes her fun to watch. Then we have our loli mage Megumin, who has chuunibyou syndrome. She casts high level explosion magic but she has some serious flaws as well. Finally we have Dustiness Ford, Raratina, who is a super masochist crusader. She interjects a bit more sexual themes into the show, but its entertaining because she often goes off into fantasies during fights.\\n\\n\r\nOur male lead Satou is the only normal character in the group and he tries to work his way into killing the demon lord with this party of weirdos. The story doesn't progress that far but I was entertained every episode as I watched the party fail or run into various bits of trouble. The other characters don't play much of a role and are only there to support the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a lot. I almost died laughing at the very first episode and knew I was going to love the rest of the show. This type of comedy usually is not my style but its handled really well. The characters are played well and the show doesn't take itself too seriously so we don't get bogged down like other shows with situations like interfering characters, the gaining of power, etc. There is fanservice and ecchi, so if that's something you cant handle for whatever reason I wouldn't watch.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: great anime, with a wonderful spin on being in a fantasy world. Very funny, great characters, beautiful art, and likable slice of life pacing. Give this one a shot, its only 10 episodes.",

            "content": "This anime was really fun! I legitimately loved it.\r\nIt's basically about a guy named Kazuma, and he gets sent to a parallel world and takes a Goddess named Aqua with him. There, they both go on a weird af adventure and meet people and do stuff.\r\nIt's REALLY funny. The comedy made the anime so much better~\r\nSo:\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThere wasn't much story or plot as I feel there could have been, but hopefully the second season (which has been confirmed) will go into the real plot more. This season was basically of Kazuma and Aqua's (weird af) adventures. :D\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nIt was really colorful and nice to lookat! (Although, I have to admit, Aqua's face looked weird at some angles.) The art sort of reminds me a bit of No Game, No Life, actually...\\n\r\nAnyway, loved the art style, although it isn't anything too too special.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe seiyuus/voice actors & actresses were AMAZING. I loved them! They were absolutely hilarious, and though the OP and ED weren't anything special, they were alright. The seiyuus made this anime really great though.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8.5/10\\n\r\nThe characters were great. There wasn't much character development, but it was still alright~ Kazuma's character was HILARIOUS. And Aqua was all selfish and funny. Darkness was adorable yet weird, and Megumin is just... Megumin xD\\n\r\nKazuma and Megumin are my favorite characters, really (although I do NOT ship them... I don't know who I ship, actually...)\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime >///< like, a lot~\\n\r\nIt was really funny~ I laughed so hard throughout it xD I mean, what's not funny about flying cabbages?!\\n\r\nThe ecchi/fanservice was tolerable... it made the anime even funnier so I was okay with it. But yeah~\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would give this anime an 8.5/10. \\n\r\nI can't wait for the second season and the OVA! :D",

            "content": "I don't usually watch isekai genre, but i felt compelled for a number of reasons: Takahashi Rie is a cheerful seiyuu, MAL score (should have learned by now not to trust it), the \"comedy\".\r\nIn MAL the anime is listed as: Adventure; Comedy; Fantasy; Magic; Parody; Supernatural, and all boxes are checked, but adventure. Imagine whatever MMORPG that you ever played, as much as you might like your initial city you eventually have to leave it to fight more difficult monsters in other regions and in Konosuba they are able to everyday return to their initial city. Is that all? Of course it isn't. Since thereis a lack of adventure they could at least provide some good fights and there aren't any, the few that we watch are plain boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is enjoyable, but mostly from the characters, don't expect beautiful scenarios or any of the such. Sound effects are lame, there are one of two worth praising, but that's it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are plain and shallow, \"like any other character from your average isekai\", but whoever picked the seiyuus nailed it in the head because their interaction are on point.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy that first season at all, and I really wanted to, I liked both Aqua and Megumin's characters, but with such a lame story and no sense of adventure I would be wasting my time in season 2.",

            "content": "I finally decided to watch it as I kept seeing memes of it everywhere and I wanted to know the fuss, but Konosuba is the first show I\u2019ve watched where I can\u2019t fathom its popularity.\r\nThere\u2019s shows that I\u2019ve disliked which are immensely popular, but I at least understood what they were going for. I don\u2019t even particularly dislike Konosuba, I just don\u2019t understand its acclaim within the anime community, as I don\u2019t feel it fulfills any particular niche. \r\nI went into this show expecting something that was kind of a cross between Steven Universe and Avatar, with how I kept seeing these \u201cAqua most uselessgoddess\u201d memes, and knowing that she represented water. I thought the other characters were going to be Goddesses of different elements or something - but if anything, this proves why I should start actually reading the synopsis of shows I plan to watch instead of just going by what I hear everyone talking about.\\n\\n\r\nThe main thought that crossed my mind when watching this show was \u201cI\u2019ve seen all of this before so many times\u201d. It\u2019s a comedy ecchi harem anime set in a Western fantasy setting, stylised after MMOs. I\u2019ve seen this exact premise so many times at this point that I\u2019m sick of it, and frankly, I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s setting Konosuba apart from all of the other anime with the exact same themes.\\n\\n\r\nAll I\u2019m seeing from this series is that it\u2019s No Game No Life but less interesting. Whilst I thought this show was mind-numbingly average and not awful by any means, and it\u2019s definitely better than other attempts at the same genre, I\u2019m just sick of people buying into the same anime over and over dressed up slightly different each time. I like video games as much as the next guy but this is just getting dumb. Sword Art Online was a mistake, as it was what ultimately led to this craze.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m expecting some kind of retort of \u201cbut it\u2019s supposed to be parody\u201d, and maybe it is, maybe I\u2019m missing the point, but satire and parody is supposed to be clear in intent and purpose, whereas Konosuba is just trying to emulate other isekai shows in such a run of the mill fashion.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, you have player character self-insert generic anime boy, who I\u2019m just going to ignore for the sake of this review. \\n\\n\r\nYou have Darkness, who\u2019s a walking sex joke and has little to offer beyond that. I don't fundamentally have an issue with sex jokes, but the ones in Konosuba are particularly low brow. The fact that they kept repeating that panty stealing joke, I couldn't help but cringe at. Episode 9 was the only exception to this, due to the pure absurdity of the situation and the intentional second-hand cringe it gave. It was like watching an episode of The Inbetweeners with how confident in his own awkwardness Kazuma was played up to be for comedic effect, and I do think that was an example of that kind of humour done well.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then you have the actual interesting characters.\\n\\n\r\nMegumin\u2019s concept is pretty funny. She has this chuuni way of speaking, which I suppose matches the fact that she\u2019s clearly supposed to be young. She\u2019s sassy, and refuses to learn any other kind of magic other than extremely powerful explosions, despite the fact that it completely immobilises her after one use. I like the idea of this, as she has potential to be used as a kind of trump card in certain situations whilst also being played for comedic effect.\\n\\n\r\nAqua, despite everyone\u2019s insistence that she\u2019s completely useless, is by far the most useful asset to the party (maybe that\u2019s the joke?), being able to heal, purify and use water magic. As a character though, I don\u2019t feel she has much to offer beyond being ditzy and the one everyone picks on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I feel all the female characters are pure waifu bait, and maybe that\u2019s the appeal of this show? But even then, there\u2019s waifu bait characters in shows that are more interesting and conceptual than this, like Steins;Gate or the Fate franchise.\\n\\n\r\nA friend of a friend called me out for using \"waifu bait\" as he called it invalid criticism, so I'll try to break down further why I think it's a problem with this show.\\n\\n\r\nHe told me the show relies on comedy as its main selling point, and to that I have to present the question \"Would it still be funny if the characters were men instead of beautiful young women?\" and the answer is firmly a no. The characters are funny because they play into traits in women that are tantalizing to the male audience. Lose that aspect, and the show is no longer funny. Therefore, I don't think \"waifu bait\" is a bad description here, even if a crude one.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the stuff that usually doesn\u2019t have a huge affect on my overall opinion: The animation is decently above average. It\u2019s colourful and fluid, with nice effects for magic. The music\u2019s ok but not particularly memorable, as it sounds like every other slice of life soundtrack from what I\u2019ve heard and remember.\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing else to say as I find this show has so little to offer and talk about.\\n\\n\r\nTl;dr please can we stop encouraging this stuff",

            "content": "Konosuba is one of those anime that will be forever remembered. It stands out from the croud of comedy. From its memorable cast to its eye candy art. Konosuba is the ultimate treat for the comedy anime fan.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story is pretty basic. It doesn't go deep or have enough plot to make worth to think critically about.  The only major part of the story you need to know is that Kazuma is trying to get out of this world by defeating the devil king. However, thanks to this anime's extremely likeable cast of characters, you will find yourself actually caring about this storybecause the chracters are just so great. More on that later.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is like consuming a rainbow ice cream sundae with a cherry on top. Extremely tastefull and enjoyable. Just like this animes quality graphics. it feels fresh and colourful. Like you really are in a fantasy world. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\r\nEverything soundtrack has a purpose in this anime. Its never out of place or just there for filler. And the soundtrack is extremely catchy too. The Op gets you pumped and ready for the adventures of kazuma and his harem gang. And after the episodes absurd and crazy journey. You are greeted with a relaxing and heartwrenching song. Sung by the best girls.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nPerhaps the best part of this anime is the characters. Ive noticed a lot of people don't like the characters, especially Aqua, because they are \"annoying\" or \"stupid.\" But a lot of people fail to see that was the point of the anime. they were made to not be perfect. And I love them for that because reality is, not everyone is perfect unlike most animes which shows the protagonist being OP AF.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 \\n\r\nTheir was never a moment where I was looking at the clock, or day dreaming of other things. It was constant entertainment and action.\\n\\n\r\nOverall. 9/10 \\n\r\nOverall, this anime will get you hooked from the very beginning to the end, Its hilarity combined with the great adventures will make you come back wanting more. And the second season only gets better. If you aren't into satire joke however, this anime might not be for you.",

            "content": "KonoSuba is a strange animal. Literally every trope it contains is fatal and it shouldn't work at all on paper. It includes, and is built on, an MC that tickles the complexes of the socially incapacitated Japanese 'Hiki-neet's, a huge female main cast(including two...or one who hasn't appeared yet), mostly cheap visuals, generic generic and generic backgrounds, standard Boke-tsukkomi combinations, an obviously unnatural focus on the roles the MCs partake in and paper thin characters that blatantly rely on their profile personalities to interact. Definitely it does.\r\nAnd yet, surprise surprise, most of the time it DOES work. All of that is down to the producers,who injected shards of brilliant and original(at least down this road) screenplay which sometimes felt simply ingenious. Credit where it's due, the high sales and the critical success comes from that reason.\\n\\n\r\nBut there is a disclaimer. It is not that this is an otaku filling moe show with tonnes of fanservice surgically implanted into it. To tell the truth it is, but it is no more so than your normal show. The praise and popularity doesn't root from that.\\n\\n\r\nThe disclaimer it that the heaps of problems this contains only works when tongue is firmly in cheek. And regardless of the reason why, lots of times they tried to pull a serious face. Never did they succeed. Even worse, it severely hurts the viewer's image of the show. It's a one to laugh with, and its fabulous comedy golds are perfect to laugh with. But when it does not work it becomes a one to laugh at. Case in point: the Darkness scenes in the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nFor me in particular it was a hard time trawling through certain episodes because of that. The pseudo seriousness Darkness brings to the table always backfires on the flow, even when it leads to the inevitable masochist joke, because that trope in particular got old extremely quickly. Every character is guilty of this, only in differing ways.\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba's qualities as an entertaining show always stem from the flaws and the gaps between its status as a game based LN show, and the production usually made great use of it and strongly amplified the effects of those qualities. Unfortunately those exact flaws lead to the fact that it would never be a perfect show, and the fact that it would always be a show gunning for a niche. It is impossible to build on it as a genre because it straddles the line innately. It is a bastard child of two genres and multiple tastes. This was the final undoing of the show.\\n\\n\r\nBut then again I admit that I enjoyed the show quite much and am disappointed by the restraints on time it got. Its highs define its lows, but the lows don't overshadow the highs. The girls are still cute. The comedy is still funny.  \\n\\n\r\nYou know what haters gonna do, haters gonna hate. Haters gonna bait. I'm not a hater, but I realise its minuses. This is a show that's bound to divide. I would stay on the like side, for now.",

            "content": "Finding evidence of a satisfying comedy is easy and while it was almost there, Konosuba failed to make me laugh. There is still a lot to like, the character interactions were crazy and comical, the way it pokes fun at RPG conventions was entertaining and the jiggle physics were delectable.  Unfortunately it is marred by the same cliches it uses to parody. \r\nThe story begins when Kazuma gets exported into a fantasy land; here he wishes to fulfill his inner adventurer and heroic desires. Quickly he finds himself in a party of three girls, Aqua, Darkness and Megumin. Of course, nothing goes as planned.Everything is turned on its head, either due to Kazuma's snarky personality, the characters surrounding him, or the world itself. This does sometimes lead to humorous situations, even if you can foresee them like for instance when Megumin was practicing her explosion magic on the abandoned castle everyday. Needless to say hilarity ensues. It's often the jokes that build up over time that work the best and showcase the most originality. Episode 9 did an awesome job of this. \\n\\n\r\nThe main problem with Konosuba is when everything is created to be a joke based on tropes; it takes away from any weightiness, which while being self-aware still encompasses a level of seriousness. It leaves little breathing room for the characters to be anything more than a gag based on generic anime humour, which is a shame because they have potential to be both interesting and be funny.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters development is lackluster, the way they interact with each other is playful and endearing. Aqua craves attention and respect but also has a simple minded and excitable side to her. Megumin takes the role of chuunibyou, it doesn't really explain why she acts this way besides a brief mentioning of her parents. Darkness, which I won't go into specifics about, fills the role of the Crusader and has two anime like twists to her character. What I really appreciate about these characters is that there all outcasts and that there is no overt harem elements. Kazuma who while has his internal perverted side treats and views his team members as troublesome friends. \\n\\n\r\nWith lots of banter between the characters, the faces are well animated and expressive to comedic effect. For the most part the art and animation feels uninspired but when Megumin wants something to explode, it really explodes. The costumes characters wear; in particular the four main characters each give them a stylistic look which helps with the otherwise not bad but plain looking character designs. The show is moderately fan service-y. There's nothing that feels over-gratuitous or uncalled for, the most noticeable aspect would be the way breasts bobble in tunics in a relatively realistic manner. \\n\\n\r\nThe OST gives off a happy go lucky fantasy feeling. The voice actress for Megumin did a good job of balancing her over the top nature without it turning into something that could have easily been annoying.  \\n\\n\r\nKonosuba is like a lighthearted, fun filled series of never ending fetch quests. At its best its a funny take on common RPG tropes with clever upheavals, hilarious events and likable characters.  At worst its a generic feeling world with characters that don't grow and are shaped by their own anime eccentricities. For me it was a little bit of both. \\n",

            "content": "This is what SAO should've been. If you disliked it, then there's a high chance you'll like this instead. Same set of rules (video-game world, see No Game No Life type of world, though)  but a much, much, much (repeat the word much at your will) better than SAO.\r\nThe story is pretty simple, though it doesn't try to be over complicated due to the nature of the show. It's just simple and to the point; there's no A, B or C into it. It's just... simple. It focuses mostly on comedic effect, though with some (I'd say very rare) serious or dramatic moments.\r\nArt isgorgeous. There's nothing much to it, but sometimes the occasional \"ecchi\" artstyle to it. Given the nature of the show, that \"ecchi\" artstyle might just improve on the satirical representations of the characters. That said, everything is pretty fluent and flows according to the situation at hand. Same can be said about the Music and Sound, they're in the right places and the music accurately represents the situation at hand. There's a few iconic pieces here and there (see: 30 Everyday Delusion A.K.A. Darkness' theme song). Voice Actors are on spot. Especially Aqua's (you'll see what I mean). Voice actors tend to be on spot in this anime and prepare to have a great experience in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a very good anime with all its right stuff in the right places. It's a very funny anime and definitely overshadows its competitors in the 'game world'. Try it out for a spin, the show's only 10 episodes long and if you don't like it in the first few episodes (I'd say give it 3-4 episodes before the characters start to grow on you) then the show isn't really going to change and you can mostly forget about it.",

            "content": "The age-old question of, \"What happens when you die?\" can be answered in a multitude of ways. However, being transported into a world of fantasy and assuming the life of a character in an RPG isn't normally an answer to that question. Directed by Takaomi Kanasaki (Is This A Zombie?) and based on the light novel series by Natsume Akatsuki, KONOSUBA plunges us headfirst into a world in which everyone is just trying to make a new living for themselves. But that is a lot easier said than done.\r\nAfter being hit by a car and dying in an attempt to be a hero for thefirst time in his life, Kazuma Sato is killed and is promptly transported to the realm of gods. Upon entering said realm, he is greeted by a rambunxious, blue-haired goddess named Aqua. Aqua, after relentlessly making fun of the way Kazuma died for a good five minutes, states that she is going to transport him into a new world and he can only take one thing with him. In order to get back at the overly spunky goddess, Kazuma elects to take Aqua herself and the two are quickly transported into a new world with nothing but the clothes on their backs. However, instead of separating upon entry, the two wind up sticking together because, you know, teamwork and stuff.\\n\\n\r\nFrom that point on, the real problem becomes making money and building up their party. The whole money part never really works out. Like ever. BUT, they do meet a couple new faces that they [reluctantly] decide to add on to their party -- Megumin, the destruction mage who can only cast one spell a day, and Darkness, the masochistic crusader tank with an affinity for embarrassment and cabbages. And so begins the journey of these four misfits and how Kazuma is so fed up with everything ever.\\n\\n\r\nThe world of KONOSUBA can be compared to the likes of anime series like Sword Art Online, being that everyone must assume the role of a particular class and use their abilities to rise in power. The driving force that propels the characters of KONOSUBA is their desire to kill the demon king who rules over their new world. Well, that's SUPPOSED to be their motivation, but no one really cares about it at all. They just want money for beer and food and stuff. But hey man, PVE isn't for everyone. Some people just want to quest and AFK and whatnot. Anyway, enough of the RPG talk, I'm getting sidetracked.\\n\\n\r\nKONOSUBA isn't about the story. In fact, the story doesn't even matter. There are two reasons to watch this show (Three if you count fanservice): the comedy and the characters. For those of you that watched Kanasaki's \"Is This A Zombie?\" be prepared for the same style of comedy. With a large bulk of it stemming from how defeated Kazuma is for having to put up with his three female party members, KONOSUBA never stops being hilarious. In fact, it's like an endless onslaught of callbacks to running jokes that gradually become even funnier as the series progresses. In all honesty, the humor in this series is some of the best I have watched in a very, very long time, and that wouldn't be possible if it weren't for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe three main girls in this series have personalities so strong that watching them becomes a sort of self-satire with each of them being walking punchlines. Aqua is always yelling or crying about how she's a goddess or whatever, Megumin is just the best and that's all there is to it, and Darkness is thirsty. (Very thirsty). The fact of the matter is that, at all times during KONOSUBA, something will always be happening in the foreground-- and, at many times, in the background as well. With a sufficient mix of both in-your-face and subtle humor, it's no wonder why this show is so damn funny. And, I know I've mentioned it before, but Kazuma is literally the physical manifestation of \"Done\". Instead of fawning over these beautiful girls like any other male anime protagonist would do, he's just like, \"Dude these b*tches are crazy,\" and continues to hate what his life has become. If he was real, I'd totally hang out with him.\\n\\n\r\nThe major downfall of KONOSUBA is its length (Which I guess is actually fine now that a second season is announced). Being only ten episodes long, we don't really get sufficient time with our beloved party members. This also creates an environment in which the story must progress at an alarming rate, but for this particular series, it kind of worked out. The fast pacing of the show sort of paralleled the comedy of it, moving at the pace of lightning relatively often. Certain plot points just randomly appear and things get all crazy for a good ten minutes before they are resolved and everything just goes back to normal. It's a lot of \"Rinse-repeat\" but it literally never becomes boring. I'd say that's pretty damn impressive.\\n\\n\r\nIn Summary:\\n\r\nKONOSUBA is extremely accessible to all anime fans. It's short, its fast, it has great characters, and it's hilarious. Being a series focused purely on comedy gave the writers enough resources and enough freedom to do whatever they wanted and it wound up spectacular. It sounds a little cliche, but KONOSUBA has something for everyone. I can't tell you if the adaptation is loyal to its light novel predecessor, but you can bet that I'll be picking that up if it's ever published in English. The second season of this series is already in development and my excitement for it is nearly identical to my excitement for the second \"Is This A Zombie\" back when that was announced. I can only hope that KONOSUBA 2 works out a little better than that did. If you're looking for a quick, light-hearted binge watch, go check this out right now. Yes, right now.",

Not what they appeared to be, this created a hilarious setting. defeating the demon lord, usually involves characters in it journeying for that objective, only to see themselves, laboring to have food in their table, or at least something that resembles one. \r\nThus their adventure starts at episode 1, and gradually, the story develops. You'd think things would start at the usual road, where hero defeat demon lord arc, when a dark enemyappears before them, only to be twisted. It was very funny. Unexpected.\\n\\n\r\nOh, they would try to create serious scenes. But they just can't help it. Their characters prevent it from becoming that. \\n\\n\r\nI grade this one an 8 out of 10.

            "content": "Another entry in the \"trapped in a videogame\" premise with a much more literal and sarcastic take on the trend. Without much plot or world-building, Konosuba lacks a cohesive structure and relies heavily on comedy to stay interesting. A little too much fanservice and not enough writing, each episode can become a slog of obvious and drawn-out jokes that somehow always end up with a female character humiliating herself.\r\nThe first two episodes are strong, with lots of unexpected twists and a story build-up that promises a wacky comedy-adventure featuring a cast of quirky, unique characters going on quests and exploring this fantasy world while searchingfor a way to defeat the evil Demon King. Unfortunately, all plot gets side-barred in the name of endless wish-fulfillment fanservice and obvious jokes that try to convince you they're self-aware and deconstructive by being transparently self-indulgent.\\n\\n\r\nKazuma checks off all the boxes of a self-insert main character: apathetic, plain, otaku, social recluse, smarter than average, inexplicably never romantically interested in anyone, and completely essential to the survival of a bunch of powerful girls. He accumulates the usual harem, each with her own quirk that usually manifests as a fetish and who views Kazuma as her leader for no particular reason. They are all walking the edge between living-stereotype and actual-person, with 90% of their behavior conforming to a single gimmick and small slices of personality and motivation.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters show flashes of personality and life, when they aren't constantly reinforcing their identities as \"girl who always does that one stupid thing\", and the clashing personalities occasionally make for some great humor. KonoSuba tries to stay self-aware and subvert all the cliches of the shonen-harem-videogame-anime, but it lacks the self-respect to not dump minutes worth of pointless fanservice into every episode while playing the exact same jokes over and over again. It feels just like every other trashy harem anime, instead of the parody of one that it's supposed to be. Rather than being a story about strong characters growing together as a group, developing themselves and exploring their world in true JRPG style, all the while bouncing personalities off each other's and poking fun at videogame tropes, most of the screen time is devoted to showing off insecure girls embarrassing themselves in front of Kazuma and inevitably begging him for help. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a distinct lack of detail that destroys all credibility of the premise. Concepts are constantly brought up and never expanded on, power-levels and abilities are completely arbitrary and inconsistent, random factions and countries are brought in and out of existence for plot-convenience, no one has a backstory, and nothing external to the plot of each episode ever happens. Every quest is stand-alone and insignificant, and the characters never change at all or improve their relationships in the slightest. None of the characters seem to even speak to anyone but Kazuma after they are introduced, unless they are talking about Kazuma, and they don't have any sense of familiarity with one another at all.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a dozen better comedy ecchi shows that have everything KonoSuba has, plus realistic relationships and some level of progression throughout the series, and - frankly - better fanservice. There are some good jokes and cute moments sprinkled throughout, but they aren't worth the 10-episode slog of the same harem garbage from every bad anime over and over again.  Good voice acting though",

            "content": "This review is spoiler FREE and extends over the course of both seasons + OVA one and two.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\nIn the following lines i will go through every aspect of the show:\r\n*****STORY*****\r\nThe story of KonoSuba is NOT finished at all and only includes about 1/4 of the actual LightNovel volumes. Sometimes it may feel a bit short and \"wow, another story finished really fast\" but overall you always feel comfortable watching this light-hearted show. Basically it's a Slice of Life Anime about some people in a MMORPG World. If you are a fan of those kind of games then you will definitely have a lot of funbecause it always refers to (for example) some RPG characteristics in a very funny way. After a couple episodes you will see that the story is not the main reason why you want to see more of it. This Anime will make you happy and is really useful to relax after a hard day at work or after a emotional episode of your favorite show.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\n*****ART*****\\n\\n\r\nThe Art of KonoSuba is simply but beautiful it its own way. Effects used in battles seem at first a bit unfitting because of the whole Art Style this show is using but after you've seen a bit it will amaze you every time. Nevertheless it would seem more appropriate to use them in A-Level Anime like SAO or Gulity Crown. You can clearly see that Studio DEEN has focused the scenes on detail. For example in the opening can you see a room with some people for about 2 seconds, but there is so much detail that you won't be able to see everything without pausing the episode. Even the goofy and poorly drawn faces are essential for the fun factor of the whole series. I laughed out loud so many times just because of their faces ^^ Many beautiful landscapes and very very VERY unique characters aswell. No one is the same. Everyone is different and peerless.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\n*****SOUND*****\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is very catchy and the ED just plain beatiful. You can clearly see that the creators of this Anime knew what to do.The sound effects used are very well chosen and used so good that battle scenes make you feel like you are AT the battleground itself. The voices of every character fits perfectly and highlight their unique personality even more. Every jokes is as good as it is told. And without those voices the show would not even be close to be as funny as it is right now. A very well executed job of the Voice Actors!\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\n*****CHARACTERS*****\\n\\n\r\nThis show would not be even nearly as good as it is without the different personalities of each character. And because of the HUGE difference between everyone, it's even funnier when they try to get along with themselves and (of course) cause more harm than intended. You will definitely learn to love every main character and even some of the supporting ones after you've seen them for a while. They are very unique and, as i already said, they fit perfectly together with Voice Actors. In my opinion every MC has some episodes where he is the Main MC and then some where we don't see something impressive of him. Overall is the main reason why i love this show so much the uniqueness of every single character and their very singular appearance.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\n*****ENJOYMENT*****\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed KonoSuba very much, therefore i was very happy that the producers announced another KonoSuba project! Can't wait to see it! The jokes are maybe not the best ones but they are told and used in a very special way that always brought my mood back up to the point where it should be. One of the best, if not THE BEST, Adventure - Comedy - Fantasy Anime that i've ever seen. Had fun in every episode and tbh i was really sad when it ended :/ WHY ARE THERE ONLY 10 EPISODES PER SEASON?!?!\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\n*****OVERALL*****\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to have a good laugh then watch KonoSuba! It doesn't matter in what situation or emotional state you are, this show will always cheer you up and will brighten the day for you:) \\n\\n\r\nFinal Result: 9/10",

            "content": "TL;DR:A burning candle that shines brightly at first,but blow itself up shortly later on\r\nIn general,Kono suba is like a burning candle that shines brightly,it has an unique setting,great characters and quite eye-catching visuals,which could grab your first insight easily.At the beginning of this anime,it's a very refreshing experience,a main protagonist,called Kazume died in an unusual,hilarious way,which he brought a stupid goddess named Aqua,who always think herself is powerful,to another fantasy world afterwards.\r\nIn the later story,Kazume and aqua met another two other girls,who are named Megumin and Darkness.Megumin is a cute little girl,who could only use explosive magic once per daily only,as this requires a lotof energy,while Darkness is a knight,who prefer going in the frontline and take the defence position,however she always having an ecchi mind in her head.The characters are pretty unique and interesting,they all have pretty good looking too.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can see,the settings are enough for you to catch your attention and you could imagine the hilarious moments from this anime,so why I'm rating this as average,but not a relatively high score?\\n\\n\r\nThe reason is very simple,the comedy itself will turn out flat and repetitive later on.The weaknesses from all three girls are being used as comedy in the story in multiple times in different missions throughout the story and it turns out flat and boring easily.\\n\\n\r\n*spoiler for the first comedy*\\n\r\nIn the first mission,Aqua is being dumb and think herself is a powerful goddess,and literally nearly being eaten by a frog.Megumin is also being dumb as well,who don't know about her weaknesses of her spell and again nearly being eaten by a frog and requires Katzume for help.Aqua then screaming and yelling for all those things happened.\\n\\n\r\n*End spoiler*\\n\\n\r\nMany similar story and character tropes will be used throughout different events.If you're okay with that,then I'm sure that you'll enjoy this show a lot,but if you're the opposite,then you'd probably will be in the opposite.This is a show that you either love it very much or you'll get bored later on.\\n\\n\r\nI expect that Kono Suba will actually have more varieties on the story itself and the characters,but in fact it doesn't.Due to the fact that the main trope is about characters dumbness and weaknesses,I can only remember the negatives of the characters,which makes me feel that the characters are pretty unrecognisable ironically.It'd be nice to see more about the characters,like their past and their backstories,but unfortunately none of them are being shown.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself could be better by replacing them with different events,rather than just doing missions all the time.In fact,in Kono Suba,the events happened are mainly just for earning livings and improve their lives.These are the factors,which are the additions to the flat comedy story in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nWell,on the bright side,the settings are described pretty well,the characters are pretty unique and it's somehow a fine adventure story,so I won't say Kono Suba is too bad.If you're a simple person,who wants some comedy on an adventure theme,this is a fine show for you.\\n\\n\r\nColour visuals are well used in several environments and events,but could be better if there're more varieties in different conversations and situations.Character designs are great as mentioned above.Op and ed are attractive and nice to hear,but if there're more sound effects  used in this anime,it'll be better.\\n\\n\r\nStory:5/10\\n\r\nAnimation:8/10\\n\r\nSound:7/10\\n\r\nCharacters:6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment:5/10\\n\r\nOverall:6/10 (C) (Good)",

The series isn\u2019t necessarily out to change the game, but it\u2019s fully aware that it\u2019s part of it. Such self-awareness makes for a show that has the look and feel of a legitimate Isekai series, yet also functions as a parody of the many harem-centric shounen/seinen stories that exist within the subgenre.\r\nKonoSuba is easily the most unique \"Trapped in an RPG-esque World\" interpretation I\u2019ve seen, and every bit as marvelous and endearing as it is dumb and crude. It\u2019s definitely worth a try.",

I'll be keeping this short and basic.\r\nKono Subarashii is the best thing that came out of Winter 2016. Literally everything including the story, the RPG like elements, the little things that would be commercial breaks if it was on TV, the amazing Art and Colour, the music, and the hilarious amazing characters made this genuinely one of the most enjoyable anime's to watch.\r\nRandom things like small little details coming by that you would thinknothing of it, maybe you'd chuckle, and then a few episodes later they would mention it and it would be hilarious. The hilarious escalation is really just amazing. Things really quickly jump from nothing to a big plot point, or even the opposite way around where you think its something major and then they just all say \"meh lets go to sleep.\" Absolutely hilarious when they do things like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Sound was very fitting and I loved the attention they put on magic, especially towards later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, crappy review, I know, but I'd like to say that Overall this is one of the anime's I can recommend the most. \\n\\n\r\nNow begone or I'll make you go away...\\n\\n\r\n~EXPLOSIONN!!!~\\n\\n\r\n- Megumin Out",

TRUST ME.\r\nEnjoyment - I'm always ROFL when watching every single episode of this anime. Very enjoying. And i warn you, don't watch it while you eating!\r\nOverall - Thisshow is very enjoyable.

            "content": "Just personal scratch.\r\nAdvised, possible spoilers.\r\nOpinion & Informal\r\nArt: 6/10\r\nI watched the BD release version. Anatomy and proportions checked out but I felt that the anatomy for Kazuma's body during the bath scene was really meh. There were one or two parts where the anatomy looked a bit off such as oddly shaped hands or somewhat misaligned facial proportions. Environmental and nature showcases were either not focused on or just underwhelming such as the plains, the landscape surrounding the city, or the snow area, to name a few. Interiors were nicely populated but the details were about average. Framing and area selection of certain scenes left muchof the interiors and town unaccounted for; I didn't feel like I got any clear picture of the aesthetics, locations, or the kind of world they were living in. Overall, I thought the (main) character details, while more on the basic side, were at least nicely clean and looked good. The background characters looked painfully over-simplified in all aspects. I thought the rest such as backgrounds, nature presentation, and supporting details were pretty average and nothing to write home about when comparing this show to other isekai or fantasy genre. This part is just extra: Since service was something that this show didn't have any problems with using as a selling point, I'll talk about how I found it interesting how attention was paid to how breast anatomy would shift between episodes; they could look overly ideal and anime-esq in a few episodes, being very plump, rounded, and generally just having that \"perfect\" silhouette  or they could end up looking more \"natural\" in other episodes. Some examples for what I mean are Guild Receptionists lady or the succubi in episode 9 in which they all had breasts that weren't affected by gravity at all and could maintain a perfect upright position. However, during the scenes in the mansion, the girls had gravity-affected breasts and in my personal opinion looked more natural. Attributed to them possibly not wearing a bra in their nightgowns? Sure, maybe. I just thought I'd point these differences out since they were so distinct and that it says a bit about the show's art quality when the most impressive thing art quality-wise I can think of is the attention to how realistic or not breasts looked between episodes. Oh yeah, the cgi elements were absolute crap. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 5/10\\n\r\nThe animation in my opinion was pretty average. There weren't any impressive impact sequences that are the kinds of things you would clip and show on YouTube and title something along the lines of \"Epic Anime Battle!\" Natural motions such as body language, facial expression changes, or things like walking or running looked fine. Action and quick movements looked fine as well but weren't good enough to warrant any praise. Cgi elements such as the mobile fortress Destroyer looked terrible and the movements from that looked so low-budget. The supporting effects such as those for any of the magic spells or sparkles were bright and flashy but they were just that. They weren't meant to impart any extra bit of world lore or intricacies, they were just a bunch of bright and pretty-looking lights to add some wow-factor to the production value and in my opinion make up for the honestly average animation and art quality. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters, Plot & Development: 5/10\\n\r\nPretty generic and one-dimensional with minimal growth throughout the duration of the show. How much did each of the characters really change from start to finish? Did Kazuma accomplish any of the goals he was aiming for when he decided to reincarnate? Did Aqua get any closer to defeating the Demon King and returning to her previous position in the afterlife? What were Megumin's and Darkness' goals again? The dynamics between characters and with the plot were underwhelming. Almost all of the show's jokes, character dynamics, and plot interactions were dictated by each one of their \"weird\" points. Darkness would in one way or another get herself into a position where she's protecting her friends then the villain or Kazuma would get weirded out by her fantasies. Were there any other notable situations where this wasn't the main theme in her screen time or other than giving us her service shots? What about Megumin? Did she ever grow as a character by the end? No. She was exactly the same from start to finish. Her relationship with Kazuma or the group didn't change and she still couldn't fire off more than one explosion. Her original reasoning of joining the group was out of pity and that she didn't have anywhere else to go at the time but nothing was really introduced to change that sort of relationship or dynamic, she stayed solely as a plot device to solve any of the big problems the group ran into, that's it; Megumin literally only showed up to take care of the group's problems and she solved it in the exact same way. Aqua's interactions were the same: she's either conniving some way to earn money, whining, or begging Kazuma to do this or that - maybe throw in that Nature's Trick spell for even more comedy. During the last episode she suddenly shows some crazy laser power that's enough to break the Destroyer's barrier; when, how, and why isn't she using that more often to earn money? Fine. If we're just going to let everything slide and just settle with me being way too picky and critical of the show, under the premise of \"it's just a parody\" and that we're not supposed to take this show that seriously, then what does this show do differently from other comedies or isekai? I found it really hard to see why this show gets the praise that it does when it feels like another generic isekai or comedy. Darkness and Megumin do exactly the same thing in 90% of their screen time for the entirety of the show. Kazuma's straight-man act is funny at first but gets old quick when the setup for the gags is exactly the same. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 5/10\\n\r\nBackground music was fine and was reused a lot, especially for Megumin sequences. Soundboard was fine too but don't expect a huge range of sword clangs or magic spells because there weren't any sword battles or the like. No sound design to note. OP and ED were fine but felt pretty generic. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: 5/10\\n\r\nCliffhanger for a second season of probably the exact same formula. We'll see. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nCharacter introductions and reasoning for joining the group were fine. I wasn't fine with how they made zero growth throughout the entire show and that an extreme majority of their screen time was to follow the exact same formula and gag setup and punchline. I didn't really see what was so great about this show in particular or what made it warrant the praise I've heard about it when considering and comparing this show to other comedies or isekai.",

            "content": "Konosuba is one of my favourite anime. For start, I want to tell you, when I decide to watch this anime, I did not expect an epic story or awesome plot. This show doesn't want to taking itself serious. In the light novel, even in important plotpoints Konosuba aren't serious. This anime series just want to make us laugh. So if you want to watch Konosuba, don't expect an awesome story or serious characters. Don't take anything seriously in this anime.\r\nArt:\r\nWell, I can't say this art style is good for a normal storytelling. But in Konosuba, Studio Deen's below-average art style is very suiting withthis non-serious and parodic anime series. So I like it so much. (8)\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nIf I should tell you something about Konosuba's story, It can be just ''So enjoyable and funny'' Konosuba is the second series I laughed the most. In every episode, I laughed at least 10 times. And when I rewatch this anime serie, enjoyment never decrease to me. \\n\r\nWell, maybe everybody's not having this much fun when watching this series. But it fits very well with my sense of humor. This is why i like this anime that much. If you like absurt comedy, you might like Konosuba so much. (10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nMy favorite part of this anime is definitely the characters. Kazuma, Aqua, Megumin and Darkness have completely different personalities and I love them all so much. Especially, Kazuma is a great protagonist. \\n\r\nFor example, in most Isekai series, the main character treats the girls in his party like they are princess, and ignores them mistakes. Kazuma doesn't do that. He have a great and realistic personality. He treats all characters equally. \\n\r\nAnd other main characters, Aqua, Megumin and Darkness are so lovable characters as well. (10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you want to watch a parody anime that doesn't take itself serious and just want to make you enjoy and laugh, you might love Konosuba so much. If it fits your humor, this show can give you so enjoyable episodes.\\n\r\n(10)\\n\\n\r\n/I want to tell you, my main language is not English. If i made some mistakes, I'm sorry.",

            "content": "Take Fairy Tail, mix in a little Re:Zero, and that's pretty much what Konosuba is. It uses the Quest-of-the-Day format and fan service of Fairy Tail, and the fantasy world that the main character likens to RPGs in fourth wall breaks from Re:Zero. While the characters are interesting, and the dialogue is funny, Konosuba falls pretty flat. SPOILER FREE:\r\nStory: 5/10. Kazuma says, at the end of the last episode, \"that was like one long tutorial,\" and he described it perfectly. 10 episodes, and in the course of them, it felt like no progress had been made in the plot. The goal is to hunt theDemon King, but it never feels like they ever get past the first steps. \\n\r\nPacing is also all over the place. The first half of the episodes follow a loose overall plot that steadily introduces each of the main characters, but the last four episodes all just feel like filler. They're self-contained snippets that are entertaining, but never building towards anything. Too many jokes about how the show is like a video game. Sometimes, there was witty dialogue, but it was littered with over-the-top innuendos and lewd shots. If you want fan service, one scene straight up borders on hentai. Also, many of the spells that each character uses just suddenly appears in their repertoire. Imagine if Naruto just started using the Rasengan, or Goku could drop a Spirit Bomb on a whim in every episode. It never feels like the characters earned something, it just fell in their lap. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10. The scenery is pretty. Characters are well animated. Spells look neat.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10. OP was very hype. ED was ok, but it was slow so I didn't stick around for it that often. Music during the scenes, esp the fight scenes, is usually on point.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10. The main character, Kazuma, leaves a lot to be desired. He's snarky, rude to the women around him, and constantly complaining about the situation he put himself in. In sum, he's a flat, unrelatable version of Natsuki Subaru of Re:Zero, to the point where I would call him \"Subaru\" in my head. Two of the girls are great, Aqua and Megunim, as each has funny quirks. Darkness, unfortunately, basically only talks about how she was to be degraded by men to get off. It's funny at times, uncomfortable as it reaches the line. Luckily, all the other characters comment on how weird her behavior is. The supporting cast, however, is great. They're likeable, dropping funny one-liners, etc. \\n\r\nThe main characters are at least interesting in that they are all balanced regarding abilities. The healer has basically no combat prowess, the tank can't do damage to enemies, the mage is a one-time nuker, and Kazuma is just an amateur at everything. They mesh well in combat scenes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10. While I thought it was funny, I ultimately felt like I wasted my time. I was at ep8 and thought about quitting, but since there were only two left I pushed through. I found it so forgettable that I had to go back and look at what the main character's name was, even though I had literally just watched all 10 eps. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10. There are reasons to like this show. The sexual humor is pretty funny, even if low-brow, but it gets worse as the show goes on. Worse, and worn out. I think if you really love fantasy, or really love Fairy Tail, then you're going to like Konosuba. If you want something simple to follow, watch this. If you like complexity, or rather depth of any level, save yourself the time. I don't think I'm even going to watch Season 2.",

            "content": "It's been a long time since I have been as dumbfounded about the hype over a show as I am after sampling Konosuba: God's Blessing on this Wonderful World. \r\nThe basic idea behind the anime is simple enough: a NEET, through what must be the most convoluted set of circumstances ever used to drag a NEET into a fantasy world, makes the occasional witty comment about the pros and cons of JRPG-like mechanics in the real world while amassing a party of girls who all range from idiotic to completely insane. \r\nA subversion of this genre blend of harem and trapped-in-a-fantasy-world has a lot ofpotential to be timely and funny in the wake of popular franchises like Sword Art Online taking center stage in recent years, and the artwork for Konosuba is charming and colorful. However, sadly, witty commentary and funny antics that show how life working like a JRPG would be both horrible and fantastic in different ways constantly takes a backseat to the lowest common denominator: sexual jokes.\\n\\n\r\nIt's obvious where both the writers and the animators have invested their time and effort: rear and/or chest centric \"male gaze\" shots abound and every little motion a female character makes causes their breasts to bounce exageratedly. (It's not quite GAINAX's infamous levels, but it's still obviously exagerated because LOL BREASTS ARE FUNNY.) An entire episode's plot is about our main character learning stealing skills - specifically, the ability to steal anybody's panties, even if he's trying to take something else. (Because LOL PANTIES ARE FUNNY AND ACCIDENTAL PERVERT NEETS ARE DEFINITELY NOT AN OVERDONE TROPE.) \\n\\n\r\nAll of this winds up being at great expense not only to the potential satire, but the characters. Our \"hero\" is rather unlikable, and it's hard to trace his character path despite having a clear goal from the first episode. His party, while refreshingly not all instantly in love with him, can pretty much all be summed up as punchlines. You have the useless godess, the girl who must blow everything up, and the masochist. \\n\\n\r\nIt was tempting to rate Konosuba lower than I did, but when I ignore the extremely confusing hype-train and the fact that the tropes the show embraces are all tropes I'm personally sick of to begin with, I come to the conclusion that the show is all-around average. Fans of shonen harem anime will probably enjoy the series, but it brings nothing new to the table whatsoever.",

            "content": "I have a very simple requirement for anime. If it did not make me cringe, I would call it a good anime that is worth watching. This one, well, THIS one has made me cringed so many times I fell like stabbing everyone involved in it. \r\nThe story:\r\nIt's a typical setting. MC goes to another world and do some shit after he died. Pathetically. If I was in his shoes I would just die a second time, period. When he got there, he expected a grand adventure and awesome teammates. Spoilers. He got a taste of the real world and shitty teammates, whom might Iadd, forced themselves into his team because they are unwanted elsewhere for being too useless.\\n\\n\r\n For the development, it got nowhere. They are supposed to defeat the Demon King, but they are not even halfway there, probably because they got too busy trying to pay off debts.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters:\\n\r\nIn an action harem anime, it's a norm to have a useless male MC who got surrounded by capable girls. In this anime, it's the opposite: the MC is the only (slightly) useful one in the party. The rest of them are just trash: a bitchy goddess who's only good for healing and partying, a mage who will run out of juice after one spell, and a masochist knight who can't even cut a stationary target. Maybe this anime is trying to break the tradition. Or perhaps, maybe not. The MC is the only one who has made any growth, the others are useless from the beginning to the end.\\n\\n\r\nAnd don't even get me started with the villain! This anime has only one villain, a Dullahan whose house was used as a target practice for the mage. Sure, he was very awesome at first, there's his whole appearance, and the way he cut down a lot of adventurers like it was nothing. But then, it went down the drain: the way he squealed like a little girl when he was about to be splashed by water, and when his head got kicked around like a football. Later, we also found out he is a pervert who uses his head to look under a Lich's skirt.\\n\\n\r\nThe fighting:\\n\r\nAgain, there isn't anything decent. The only fight scene is between the MC and your typical knight in shining amour (no, I am NOT counting the \"fight\" between the Dullahan and the knight). This one barely has any action. MC stole the dude's sword and smacked his head with it, the end. Seriously?\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing, I can't tell whether this anime is trying to teach its audiences about the harshness of the real world or show them what a fantasy world looks like. On one hand, the MC started his adventure with a real job, and got more and more debt piled up because of his and/or his teammate's  blunder. On the other, there is the MMORPG setting of this world where a character can learn a skill by registering it on his ID card thing, without any sort of training. Make up your mind, people.\\n\\n\r\nI have read/ watched more than 100 mangas/ animes all these years, and I can tell you this: this anime isn't worth watching. I seriously don't know what's the hype about.",

            "content": "Before you start reading this review, I'd just like to point out that I tend not to score shows based on how high-quality they are. If I enjoy something, I'll give it a high score, regardless of whether it was technically outstanding or not.\r\nAnyway, here we go!\r\nStory:\r\nKonosuba is essentially your typical 'trapped in a fantasy world' story, but instead of focusing on an intense struggle to escape this world and get back to reality, Konosuba is all about the light-hearted exchanges between Kazuma and his three companions, with a couple of side characters here and there. While every episode does have some kind of goalor plot to it and there is a main goal for Kazuma, this show isn't exactly story-driven. Instead, it focuses more on bringing you a good laugh with some brilliant characters.\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art in Konosuba certainly isn't of the highest quality. In particular episodes, you could even go as far as to call the animation bad. However, I personally feel that the rather clumsy nature in a lot of the art adds to this show's charm. The characters are all clumsy and stupid, and the animation and art portrays them in this kind of way. The world and cast are also very colourful and lively, immersing you more in the world the show takes place in. Despite it's low-quality nature, I just can't help but like the art in Konosuba.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of this show is certainly nice to listen to. It doesn't exactly stand out anywhere, but it's not dreadful either. The OP song, performed by Machico, is really catchy and upbeat, while the more relaxed ED song, performed by the lead female voice actors, is a pleasant end to every episode. I usually do love it when voice actors sing for the show, and it's great here.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nOne of Konosuba's main strengths is its hilarious cast. Kazuma, the main character of the show, is a rather scummy guy, but he still contributes well to the show, and doesn't feel like a typical useless main guy as is common in this type of show. \\n\\n\r\nThe girls that accompany Kazuma are equally great. You have the selfish and petty goddess, Aqua, the childish wizard, Megumin, and the valiant yet masochistic knight, Darkness. The characters are all really hilarious, and each get their fair share of screentime and jokes. The voice actors also put in a really good job for every single character, particularly Megumin and Kazuma, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nKonosuba is a brilliant comedy show that stands out among other similar shows. It nails the comedy aspect just right, and the characters and the world they live in are vivid and well-designed. I can't wait for the season 2!\\n\\n\r\n10/10",

            "content": "Oh, jeepers creepers, here comes another dumbass RPG-themed anime with little thought put into its setup and setting and mechanics, a bunch of stupid girls orbiting the main character, who of course is/was a shut-in NEET, and a bunch of weird, slapstick moments.\r\n...Except it\u2019s\u2026 actually\u2026 good\u2026?????\r\n(this contains some minor spoilers at best)\r\nLet\u2019s quickly get one thing out of the way. KonoSuba is a stupid anime. It\u2019s very stupid. On the surface, it has the most generic setting and plot imaginable with a few stupid girls orbi--oh wait, I just said that. But what lies beneath its fragile crust is actually a hilarious and self-aware animethat parodies many of the tropes found in the \u201ctrapped in an MMO\u201d types of series. It works because it\u2019s so stupid.\\n\\n\r\nThe start of KonoSuba, where the main character, Kazuma, dies and later comes to this fantasy world, is where the series makes it clear that it IS just goofing around. The circumstances that bring him here are so absurd that you should probably stop watching the anime if you\u2019re gonna take it seriously from this point on. The crazy train only continues. It builds up characters only to turn them on their heads to continue the absurdity. An early example is the main girl, Aqua, a literal goddess who values herself highly and is shown to be vastly superior to Kazuma until she\u2019s dragged down to his level and is revealed to be a complete dipshit despite her magical abilities. Every other character that joins Kazuma\u2019s party shares a similar theme: they appear to have overwhelming talents and maybe even an intriguing backstory, only for them to be almost completely flawed.\\n\\n\r\nThe same things happen with the plot points: things will be built up even to an intense and dramatic level only for said moods to be flung back at you with a quick gag that changes everything. Similarly, the party will achieve some level of success, but they simultaneously screw something up, and the consequence of it negates most, if not all of that success. KonoSuba is basically a funny series of unfortunate events, and its recurrent use of situational irony is the key to its success. But these little gimmicks and japes aren\u2019t just there for the sake of comedy, they\u2019re actually weaved into the plot pretty well; it\u2019s not like a lot of slapstick shows that simply spout memes and force a bunch of out-of-character moments in hopes that the audience will like it; the seemingly random events will actually have an influence on the story in the future, even if it\u2019s just minor.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, here\u2019s one thing that I think might be misunderstood: this isn\u2019t much of an action anime. There are some action scenes, sure, but a lot of them will only show the minimum amount needed to make sure you know what\u2019s going on. I like this move. KonoSuba knows what kind of anime it is and what it\u2019s supposed to do; it doesn\u2019t break its own character by having intense, elaborate fight sequences, it just puts the action on the backburner and keeps the comedy up front. If you\u2019re looking for a comedy anime with some good action, I recommend looking elsewhere. All that being said, I\u2019d like to point out that this isn\u2019t a romance anime, either; but unlike the action genre, KonoSuba\u2019s actually listed as a romance right now. Whether or not we\u2019ll actually see romance in the future is not something I know, but these ten episodes don\u2019t have any of that.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s anything to complain about in terms of story, beyond it being basic as hell, it\u2019s that the unbalance of the world and the general lack of success from the party means that the plot doesn\u2019t really go anywhere; though the hijinks themselves are really enjoyable, it gets a little tedious being in the same place after a while. It starts to remedy this towards the end, as the party will indeed make progress eventually, but then you realize that the anime is only 10 episodes longer, and I wish it were at least 12.\\n\\n\r\nSo, while the plot can be glossed over on a basic level, the characters are much more attention-grabbing. I mentioned that they all are introduced as overwhelming people but instead have comically bad attributes instead. Aqua was made to be an annoying character, for the most part, but her personality is pretty effective in this context; she\u2019s overly-confident, but when things go wrong or her weaknesses come into play, she shows a much weaker side of herself. Her scenes with Kazuma are great, too, since Kazuma doesn\u2019t wanna put up with any of her shit. \\n\\n\r\nMegumin and Darkness come into the show in a pretty short amount of time, and are probably the best-written characters. Beyond their interesting personalities, what makes them likable is how passionate they are in what they do. They\u2019re fully aware of their massive flaws, but choose not to fix them and do the opposite--they EMBRACE them instead. It\u2019s amazing. They still have some extremely limited but notable strengths, however, and they capitalize on these strengths instead. \\n\\n\r\nKazuma, the main character, is undoubtedly my favorite--yeah, yeah, I know everyone likes Megumin more, but Kazuma is truly the crux of KonoSuba. He keeps this wild ride going because he\u2019s the self-awareness of this anime. Kazuma is the character who won\u2019t hesitate to ask himself \u201cwhat the actual FUCK is going on right now?\u201d At many points, he questions the logic of the world, his teammates, and this whole nonsense. His quick little remarks never failed to amuse me, but he\u2019s not really a straight-up asshole about everything; there are obvious moments where he genuinely cares about his friends and this terrible world. In such a strange, bizarre, non-sensical world, having a main character that\u2019s like a normal person (but maybe a little bit more?) is great. I really think this guy deserves more credit. That\u2019s right\u2026 Kazuma best girl.\\n\\n\r\nBut if KonoSuba comes up short in anything, it\u2019s the art. The art looks decent at best, with some moments of it being pretty good, like Megmin\u2019s ECKSUPLOSHUN!!!! magic, and looks like the current life of Jared Fogle at worst, which is pretty much the case for the second half. It seems like Deen didn\u2019t put a lot of effort into this and only wanted to do a trial run to see how it\u2019d do, which might be why it\u2019s only 10 episodes instead of 12. They try making up for this by shoving as much fanservice in as they can, which I find to be funny more than sexy. The amount of boob physics, and some wardrobe choices like Aqua\u2019s 2.03 millimeter-long skirt and that one filler character who wore a loin cloth, I felt that the fanservice was a joke in and of itself. I mean, everything else is pretty ridiculous, why not this too? But one last thing that I didn\u2019t like were the mission screens that would pop up whenever a new assignment started, paused, continued, or ended. They were cheesy as hell, and it\u2019s not like we needed to be reminded that this is supposed to be some sort of RPG-themed setting. That\u2019s why we have Kazuma.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is nothing to write home about at all; the only song that was remotely interesting was whatever track plays when Megumin uses her magic, which is as corny as a field in Iowa, but still kinda interesting. The voice actors do a pretty great job with their roles, though; they\u2019re well-casted and each deliver a great performance that never lets up, from Kazuma\u2019s retorts under his breath, to Aqua\u2019s psychotic outbursts, to Megumin\u2019s powerful incantations, and Darkness\u2019 sadomasochistic cries. A talented set of seiyuu for a wonderful set of characters.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum things up, I expected KonoSuba to suck and was blown away in pretty much every aspect. There have been few other times where I\u2019ve had such a great time watching an anime and be anxiously waiting for the next episode. If I rated anime just by how much I enjoyed them, MAL would need a new scale. I\u2019m so, so glad this is selling well in Japan, and I really look forward to the second season.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 7/10\\n\r\nArt - 3/10\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 15/10\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\r\nFavorite character - Kazuma\\n\r\nFavorite episode - 1 (also 2-10)\\n\r\nRecommendation level - Very High",

            "content": "I strongly agree with everyone who is commending KonoSuba [so much I had to write my first review] for it's ability to provide a good, enjoyable 24 minutes. It's not a flawless, gripping, edge-of-your seat story. It's a show that doesn't take itself seriously, and excels at just that. \r\nAs of recently, the \"action\" shows that are coming out tend to be much more enjoyable when the show doesn't take itself too seriously. I can't remember the last legit action show I enjoyed, but it must have been Kiseijuu/Parasyte--which was handled magnificently by a studio that actually knows how to take itself and it's workseriously, and ultimately deliver a good product.\\n\\n\r\nStory: You have your stereotypical, cynical shut-in for a main character, who starts the show by dying in one of the most hilarious ways possible. The rebirth process that follows is too good to spoil. Everything is backwards from what you would expect from your average rebirth/fantasy/save-the-land anime. Every new recruit to the MC's party is so unexpectedly pathetic you can't help but want to see their next demise. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Soundtrack was... not too memorable, but at least it wasn't memorably bad. The ending theme had a very relaxing, playful vibe to it, which was a plus because it kept my attention for the entire credits-roll--that rarely happens.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Wow, I'm not sure if its just me, but this show is incredibly crisp when you're watching it in the highest definition available for it (1080p). The animation is quite colorful, but not extremely saturated and vivid like No Game No Life (not that vivid/saturated colors are a bad thing)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A very enjoyable 24 minutes in which you can relax, sit back, (enjoy the music?) and don't have tire yourself paying attention to every small detail.",

            "content": "I personally really liked this anime, but I know it's not to everyone's liking.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThere doesn't seem to be any set storyline, each episode has its own mini story.\r\nSo basically, this shut-in otaku named Kazuma Satou goes out to buy an early release of a game when, while he's walking home, he decides to save this girl about to be run over by a truck. But what's this? She wasn't about to be run over by a truck, but instead, she had stopped to talk to a friendly farmer passing by on his tractor. Now our hero Kazuma is run over by this tractor andhas a heart attack from the shock and dies. In death, he meets an annoying goddess, Aqua, who offers to transport him to a parallel universe much like an rpg, even allowing him to bring any item he'd like! As punishment for being so annoying, Kazuma decides to take Aqua with him. She is forced to teleport to this parallel universe with Kazuma because of the rules of heaven, or something. The anime follows the day to day problems that Kazuma and Aqua face. Kazuma and Aqua form a guild and Kazuma makes a harem out of the quirky characters that decide to join.\\n\r\nThis anime is a light-hearted comedy harem that I suggest you watch if you're looking for a quick laugh with a hint of action.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nThe art style is very generic, character-design and setting-design wise. The only thing is, the colors are so very bright and energetic that you can't help but notice it! I'm a sucker for pretty colors so, even though it was very generic, I liked it quite a bit. I think the artists really got the fluidity of animation down as well as the character's expressions. It all added up to a very interesting viewing experience. Or something of the other.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nNow, he sound track was also very generic. Nothing really caught my ear and drew me in, but it did go along with the feel for the events very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters didn't develop much. A few developed just a little, but it was very unnoticeable as the main focus of the anime is to give you a laugh. The characters were very fun, though and they each had their traits that made them funny to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI personally found this anime to be very funny which made it fun to watch. It had it's share of action (cause who wouldn't want their share of that, right?) but even the villains had their quirks which made even their monologuing funny.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is an enjoyable anime that I suggest you watch if you're in the mood for something funny but very short.",

It doesn't heavily rely on dialogue for humour, it has good comedic timing, it often switches its art to better complement the jokes, the voice actors are clearly enjoying their lines, and its main cast of colorful members have great (or should I say terrible) chemistry.\r\nPlotwise, the overarching story doesn't advance much during the short 10 episode run, and none of the side characters seem relevant. The season felt like an advertisement for the main group. I'm curious to see if they make some progress next season, but honestly I'm more curious to see what kind of nonsensical shenanigans the group willget into. Finally, I think the animation and the soundtrack were meh except for Megumin's glorious explosions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'm not a fan of the 'Isekai' genre and the season felt far too short and empty to deserve a high score but it is funny and I love the main cast except Darkness.

And I found myself bored by the end of each episode.Do not get drawn in by the cute characters and fun look of this show, I can tell you it is anything BUT a comedy and often had me feeling deppresive about how bad the half assed attempt at comedy was.

            "content": "Just wanted to chime in with a quick review on my 'ehhhh' viewpoint re: Konosuba. As many of the other 'I-thought-it-was-less-than-stellar' reviewers here mention, Konosuba *did* somehow keep me watching for all 10 episodes, but I'm not sure how much I enjoyed myself.  \r\nTo be fair, around episode 4, I thought, \"huh, I'm enjoying this a lot more than I thought I would given that it's a generic fantasy-based-quasi-ecchi-quasi-harem-comedy,\" but as the series wore on, I found myself liking it less and less. Why? Well, as others have also pointed out, Konosuba's strength (comedy) is also it's weakness, in that the show relies onTHE SAME JOKES OVER AND OVER AGAIN. \\n\\n\r\nInitially, the show ticks all the good comedy boxes. MC thinks he makes the ultimate sacrifice but instead dies a meaningless and embarassing death? Lolz. Goddess of water (and the underworld, apparently?) who turns out to be actually useless? Hahaha, good one! Super-powerful mage of a special race who it turns out can *only* use one kind of magic and can only use that once a day? Teehee! Bold female crusader who is uses the allegedly selfless protector role of her profession as a means of getting off? Ok, actually unexpected and pretty funny.  All of these characters combine, at least initially, to make a pretty amusing group. That being said, because the humor of the situation relies entirely on the party and the party members being or behaving in a way that is contrary to what you assume they *should* be like given their race/class etc., it gets old VERY quickly. These trope subversions are the only source of humor in the show (aside from a few potty and panty jokes)  and are reused again, again, and again. \\n\\n\r\nThere is very little in the in the way of plot or character development. Normally I have less stringent standards for that in a comedy than I do in a drama, but without a true shift in characters, plot, or setting, the humor falls flatter each time it's employed. \\n\\n\r\nAround episodes 3 or 4, I thought this might be a 7 or 8-star show, based largely on the art (not bad) and how much it was making me laugh. By the time episodes 9 and 10 came around, I was eyerolling and pretty much making a point of finishing the series mostly because there were so few episodes left. \\n\\n\r\nJust my two cents. I'm not sure I want to attempt to convince anyone to skip this series per se (hell, I might still even watch Konosuba 2 at some point), but if you've seen a few episodes and are wondering whether to keep going, I'm here to say \"no, it doesn't get better.\"\\n\\n",

After seeing the synopsis and the ratings I thought it would be a good one but no, konosuba utterly disappointed me.\r\nThe story was good to begin with but I think the series kind of lost it's focus in the middle. There was very little reference with respect to the devil king, the main reason for Kazuma's presence in the world to begin with. The story mainly focused on characters burning away their money and various perversions. Okay, maybe that was the point of the anime and maybe it was not supposed to be abattle sort of thing, but on the humor front also the anime disappoints. There is very less moments which send you laughing.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was good. There wasn't any fault with that. The battle sequences (though rare and short) were well orchestrated, especially the one in the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that the anime lacks miserably apart from all it's shortcomings is the background score. It is meant to complement the humorous parts also but it was absent from those sequences. Again perhaps only the battle scenes were the ones pretty well executed. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters were mostly 1 dimensional with little or no development. Apart from the four main ones, there were no other extras to provide some respite. I could just watch the anime because it was okey dokey.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point I have absolutely no hope from the second season (whose synopsis declares pretty much the same thing as that of the first). I just think I will get over with it as soon as possible and then move onto something better.\\n\\n\r\nWatch this one if you have run out of good animes to watch and have lot of time to kill.

            "content": "Ah, isn't it every gamer's dream to immerse themselves in a real-time fantasy world complete with adventure, magic, and friends? In an interesting spin on the \"game immersion\" genre, Konosuba delivers an exciting, traditional perspective on a gamer-turned-adventurer character, though presents itself as a very niche title.\r\nWill you like it?\r\nYou may enjoy Konosuba if you...\r\n-- find the \"fantasy game\" genre appealing, notably including RPG-type progression\r\n-- consider yourself a \"gamer\"\r\n-- like series that focus heavily on a singular group or party of characters\r\nwant a short, fun series that doesn't take itself seriously\r\nYou may not enjoy Konosuba if you...\r\n-- feel uncomfortable with or have low tolerance forlewd or suggestive content\\n\r\n-- generally avoid the fantasy, supernatural, or comedy genres\\n\r\n-- don't find the main character relatable whatsoever\\n\\n\r\nStory (read the synopsis first!)\\n\\n\r\nThe first season of Konosuba is a relatively shorter series than the average, having only ten episodes. Most episodes concern themselves with the party pursuing a given quest or training for future endeavors, with there being a slight mini-arc in the middle. As for the main goal of actually slaying the Demon King, the party keeps a realistic understanding that they are nowhere near prepared enough to take on the end-game content.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself I found extremely enjoyable, nothing too expansive and more focused on the characters and their struggles than anything. I enjoyed the unique take on the fantasy world, something I'll explain further later on, and felt it to be a mixture of several different animes in one.\\n\\n\r\nIt's worth noting that Konosuba does suffer from confusing pacing and expository issues, notably in the second half. A couple episodes introduced characters previously unknown to the audience that somehow had relevance to the main characters. This may very well be an error made as a result of the adaption, though it's no less excusable. Considering, too, this series was insanely popular and had its second season approved quite quickly, I'm hesitant to say it was \"rushed\". The series could have easily been expanded to account for the missing content, so I hope to see this issue fixed in the subsequent season.\\n\\n\r\nGenre & Characteristics\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to put a name to the \"game\" genre that has blossomed quite a bit since the release of Sword Art Online. Konosuba stands apart from its fellow game series in that it pursues a traditional setting, with no technological foundation, user interfaces, or hyperactive combat. Everything is set in a somewhat feudal or medieval setting, with magic and the supernatural serving as the boundaries of the universe. Personally, I perceive this as a better, more familiar setting, and the series executed it quite well.\\n\\n\r\nFurther along the \"gaming\" spirit, one will appreciate how loyal the series is to the various attributes of a roleplaying game. Magic, progression, and guilds dominate much of Konosuba's setting. Players complete \"quests\" for rewards such as \"xp\" or \"Eris\", the currency of the universe, and allow themselves to increase their combat potency by learning skills and spells. Konosuba succeeded with this format, though it was noticeably underplayed. I would have liked to see a greater focus on the level progression of the individual characters than what we received, as level gains were often noticed in passing and not highlighted as we'd expect.\\n\\n\r\nAny prospective viewers with prudish views towards what is commonly referred to as \"fanservice\" would do well to ignore this series, as Konosuba is a heavily suggestive from beginning to end. A lot of the gags are suggestive in nature, with magic involving stealing \"panties\" and the such. I understand that for many individuals, this may prove a turn off, so it's best not to go in the series thinking anything else. This kind of content doesn't bother me, and I don't think it affected the series in a negative way at all, but I also know how it's a \"make or break\" for some. Your choice.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nThe animation throughout Konosuba is actually quite impressive, with all of the magical effects and combat sequences vividly detailed and choreographed well. I wouldn't call it innovative, but quality in execution. The sunshafts and lighting stand out as one of the greater elements of the aesthetics, with Studio Deen proving themselves a skilled studio that understands how to build a believable and aesthetic setting.\\n\\n\r\nIt's worth nothing that while the animation is great, there are many noticeable moments where you notice sharp improvements in quality. Virtually all of Megumin's casts of her explosion magic were well designed and quite mesmerizing even, each their own isolated performance of devastation. Further, the animators put more effort into animating the breasts than some studios do for entire series. Honestly, the jiggle physics are unreal, borderline hyperbolic at times, and easily one of the best parts of the animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nI can't really say that the soundtrack from Konosuba is a memorable one, but it has its merits. A few of the background tracks were inspired heavily by the fantasy setting, and those were certainly the best ones. Both the opening and ending pieces are well made and very character-centric, introducing and concluding the exciting world of Konosuba proficiently. Really, the only noticeable detriment of the music is that it can get repetitive at times, with Darkness' track coming to mind as it played each time she had one of her masochistic monologues (and these are often).\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuu are fantastic, and I give particular credit to Kazuma and Megumin for their outstanding performances. Jun Fukushima (Kazuma) nails the youthful, sarcastic teenage boy voice with Megumin (Rie Takahashi) acting with the proper attitude and spunk befitting a \"crimson demon\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nJust like a great roleplaying game, a great fantasy anime needs a well-rounded cast of unique, individual members. For the most part, I would say Konosuba achieved this, though certain characters leave more to be desired in some ways.\\n\\n\r\nKazuma, the adventurer, is the most grounded character of the four, the only human from Earth. Aqua describes him, quite accurately, as a shut-in NEET, since in his former life he was an avid gamer and fairly introverted. I found him to be the most relatable character, offering realistic (and often humorous) perspectives about the various insane situations he and his party find themselves in. Characters can often get predictable within their given genres, and Kazuma offers spontaneous dialogue that greatly challenges those expectations. A good example of this would be, despite being accompanied by some considerably attractive companions, he never fawns over them like you'd expect a character in his position to do. Rather, quite the contrary, as he is often irritated by their presence considering their uselessness at times. Kazuma experiences the most growth throughout the series, as the \"shut-in NEET\" we once knew him to be dies off slightly as he assumes more and more responsibility. I guess sleeping in the stables for weeks on end will spur a man to action.\\n\\n\r\nAqua, the arch priest, is a beautiful yet pretentious goddess of water that enforced Kazuma's reincarnation. While she is inherently powerful, she's not very bright, ironic as she considers herself above humans. She relies a lot on Kazuma for money, generally spending what she has either learning party tricks or drinking at the guild. Though irritating at times, there are many genuine moments where the viewer can grow to appreciate Aqua, and her attitudes towards Kazuma and humanity overall change slightly over the course of the series.\\n\\n\r\nMegumin, the arch wizard, serves as the party mage and is easily the most likable of the three. A crimson demon herself, beings of great magical power with ch\u016bniby\u014d personalities, she specializes entirely in destructive explosive spell, the most powerful magic known to man (though she can only cast one per day before draining all of her power). Personally, Megumin is the best party member of the crew, and ends up having some of the more hilarious interactions with Kazuma.\\n\\n\r\nDarkness, the crusader, is a masochistic, oddly perverted champion of justice. She expresses a great deal of dedication and honor, holding the values of being a \"knight\" close to her heart. As her primary disadvantage is that she is clumsy and can't even hit a stationary target, she chooses instead to be a shield for her friends, though much to her enjoyment as she finds sexual excitement in the idea of taking a beating. She is the most underdeveloped of the four, though you can see glimpses of potential in her character towards the end of the season. I assume because of specific revelations that she will be further explored in the future, which is great because she's such a sweetheart.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is no sort of backstory for either of the characters that isn't revealed throughout dialogue. As someone that prioritizes the merit of the characters above all else, this somewhat bothers me, especially considering the immense potential for the lot of them. While the next season may focus more on the identities of each adventurer, I'm reviewing the current season as-is, and it falls short in this particular regard.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, one thing the writers can be heavily credited with was their intention to not make the protagonists overpowered at the start. In fact, to the contrary, the party is at a severe disadvantage throughout the series due to their respective disadvantages and low experience. For example, in the second episode, we find both Kazuma and Aqua nearly overwhelmed with what seems to be an easy quest objective in slaying giant toads. As time progresses, everyone gets stronger, most certainly, but they still never reach a point where an action is trivial. This stylistic decision can be attributed to real life relevancy, as I'm sure that many of us have understood the despair of having friends play with you but be complete and utter garbage. I also assume this is to build up for the subsequent season(s) the series will receive, where the characters will inevitably get strong enough to confront the Demon King. Witnessing the slow, even painful growth of a group of characters generally wins out over having them grossly empowered at the start.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nKonosuba retains an extremely loyal fanbase, and I can see why. It's got charm, character, presents itself as a fun series that doesn't try to be anything other than that. I finished Konosuba in one day while going into it with low expectations. Under no circumstance is it, as I have seen it heralded, \"the saviour of anime\", but if you find the concept appealing and Kazuma relatable, expect to conclude it satisfied. If the writers can iron out some of the pacing issues and give more attention to each character individually, I have no doubts that Season 2 make a quality series even better. With that being said, is Konosuba God's blessing on this wonderful world? That'll be up to you to decide.\\n\\n\r\n\"Come, now, and walk the path of explosions with me!\" -Megumin",

            "content": "Absolutely terrible. \r\nI thought this show had some degree of promise, in both character design / development and comedy. It falls flat abruptly in all departments. There is not one constitution that this anime does well in besides the average art design.\r\nStory :\r\nRubbish. Fight demon king, does the cliche '' I choose you'' option, picking out the deity presenting the weapons. Who could have seen that coming - clearly not the goddess,as she was obliged to conform to his request whilst in a state of shock. \r\nThe adventure begins.\r\nThe primary focus is the comedy, which like all comedy, is a hit and miss, but ata slightly objective standpoint, the comedy is recycled and often uses juvenile sexual innuendos as the focal point. \\n\\n\r\nTheir journey is just doing odd tasks in the most desperately goofy way possible. It mostly feels episodic and not much of anything happens most of the time, as they are busy making their recycle jokes on rewind. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, this is nothing but comedy. Recycled comedy revolving around juvenile sexual humour. Don't expect engrossing combat mechanics, character development, or any insight into the characters - they are goofy to be, well, goofy. \\n\\n\r\nIf you don't get exhausted watching cheap, juvenile fights, where the characters employ crappy, futile strategies over and over again (doing the same thing), just to be funny, then this is for you. *does an attack* *doesnt work* gets eaten gets saved, does it again. Funny. As for mechanics themselves, it's just bright colours with properties not defined. \\n\\n\r\nThere is never really any threat of anything serious happening. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : \\n\\n\r\nThe worst attribute. The already lacking story substance is further diluted by the terrible characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all mentally destitute to the point where they sound like broken muppets on rewind. Their jokes became painfully predictable and bland, very quickly. There is no way you can get invested in any of the characters due to their well resolute character design with no development. \\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, they are made so desperately goofy and repetitive that you often don't need to listen to what they say, as 90% of it is a comedic premise you have more or less heard explicitly earlier on the same episode, and the one before that. Yes, the author likes repeating jokes, despite this being a 10 episode anime. \\n\\n\r\nYou have the character Darkness, whom is a crusader that loves to get turned on and twist almost any comment into some desperate sexual reference on rewind.She misses all strikes and just stands there as a shield and her clothes rip off. That's the gimmick.  Then, there is the character Megumni, whom only uses explosion magic which renders here immobile after one use, despite all logic- cause it's funny. The Goddess Aqua, whom the main character tricked into joining him (again, the cliche ''I choose you'', how could you have seen this coming scenario), uses water party tricks and some bright rays of light that works well against undead. Not that it's used profoundly, its just shoot and it either falls flat for comedy, or it is ridiculously powerful. As for the main character, he acts as a medium to a small voice of reason amidst the nonsense, which was a nice touch. But most of the time, he is just whining about the antics while going through with it, or only adding to it. He is a teenage virgin surrounded by 3 attractive females as a gimmick, and goes through the cliche rejection of any advances, lack of reciprocation of any advances despite strong offerings, all the while being a virgin and having perversions whom acts out his bickering and whatnot with the characters. Not cliche at all. Written this way just not not complicate the stupid-themed anime with any relationships.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nAverage\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound :\\n\\n\r\nBad. Forgettable. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : \\n\\n\r\nNon existent. 0/10 \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nDon't watch this",

Konosuba builds itself up to fall into a lot of different cliches and then just laughs it off. The potential harem is about as obvious as the fact that the main character is....well.... a main character. But the anime lets you expect to see these cliches and then throws your expectations back in your face. \r\nInstead of being adored and chased by his all-female party the main character Kazuma(Yes, this is Kazuma) is given ample face-palm moments in the place of his harem. Konosubatells the story of the worst RPG party imaginable. His dream to not only survive but thrive inside of an RPG like world? It's destroyed by the crushing reality that his party, despite having every opportunity and possibility to be very OP, is crushed under the weight of their own inadequacy. \\n\\n\r\nThe character cast couldn't be more diverse. In a world where survival itself is the main focus, Kazuma's(Yes, this is Kazuma) party isn't afraid to let each of their individual character traits divide them. From a snobby goddess, an eager young mage, and a masochistic crusader, the series shows no lack of uniqueness in the character design and half of the show is watching how the dysfunctional unit can even survive at all, let alone prosper(reminds me of Twitch Plays Pokemon).\\n\\n\r\nEcchi moments are abound and if this is a \"make it or break it\" subject for you then Konosuba might get a thumbs down. The plot can be messy and time skips get confusing but it's a comedy series. You're here for the gags and looking too deep into the plot is like listening to death metal for the lyrics. \\n\\n\r\nIf you ever needed a solid comedy anime that isn't afraid to break the cliche mold \"KonoSuba: God's Blessing on This Wonderful World!\" may be just what the Doc ordered.\\n\\n\r\nMegumin is best girl.",

            "content": "I'll be honest: when the season started, I wanted absolutely nothing to do with KonoSuba based off of its early synopsis. To me, it made it sound like it was going to be some poorly written romance drama (Kind of like Ao No Kanata became, which I was actually fairly excited to see). I think I watched the first episode just for the hell of it, and I was extremely pleased to find that KonoSuba was NOT at all what I was expecting it to be.\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nI don't need to say how overplayed the \"Transported to a game world\" plot device is, because everyoneknows it by now. If it weren't for KonoSuba's excellently executed comedy, I likely would not have enjoyed it nearly as much as I did. The story doesn't get more than a 7 from me because what little story there is is very disjointed and pushed to the background to make room for the comedy (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). What saves it is how it's incorporated into the hilarity of the series. There are a couple episodes dealing with one of the Demon King's henchmen, Dullahan, where Megumin is daily practicing her Explosion magic on his castle, and he arrives at the city to get his revenge. Hilarity ensues, but that's about all we get of the Demon King story, which is apparently the whole reason Kazuma was reborn in this world in the first place. However, that doesn't stop the fact that KonoSuba had some fairly impressive world building for a ten episode first season, and what made it impressive to me was how the world building was used to create some incredibly hilarious situations. The Giant Frogs that nearly wiped out the entire party and the humor that came with it, the freakin' FLYING CABBAGES, the encounter with Dullahan, the whole Destroyer nonsense, and so on and so forth. KonoSuba's generic premise is saved by its parody aspects and its absurd nonsense.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\r\nFrom what I've heard, Studio Deen isn't exactly a top tier studio, especially in the visual department, and it shows in KonoSiba. But I think the hilariously derpy to average-at-best artstyle here contributes a lot to the character of the show, which is why I'm not giving it a 5 or 6. It's a bit difficult to explain why this is, so don't ask me for an in-depth explanation. Other than that, the character designs are nice. The female characters all look cute (which is always a win), and the rest of the characters all look decent. The monsters and backgrounds look cool sometimes. That's about it.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening theme is quite good, the voice acting sounded great, and I absolutely LOVED the ending theme. The background music was decent, but there really isn't too much more to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9/10\\n\r\nThese characters are an absolute riot! You have the hilariously cynical and real Kazuma, the narcissistic goddess Aqua-sama, the loli-mage-who's-sexually-attracted-to-explosions Megumin (best girl of the season, by the way), and the masochistic knight Darkness. Together, this band of useless misfits attempts to succeed in this fantasy world, and it is a \"blast\". Their interactions with each other and the other side characters are just so hilarious and fun. Sure, they can be a little perverted at times, but if you're like me, you'll appreciate it. It's not overdone to the point where it overshadows the actual \"plot\" (I'm using the term loosely), and it's not underdone to where you'd be thinking to yourself \"what was the point?\". Instead, it's just enough to add to the flavor of the anime. But I digress. Like I said, these characters are simply a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\r\nI think it's evident in my above statements that I vastly enjoyed watching Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!, so I won't go into too much more detail here. I'm glad I gave it a chance even when I thought it was going to be garbage.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\r\nIf you're getting tired of the \"Game World\" trope, I'd definitely recommend KonoSuba for a fresh, enjoyable, and hilarious take on it. If you never enjoyed that style in the first place, you may not like it that much, but since it's more similar to a parody, I'd at least give it a shot.",

            "content": "Best comedy of this season \r\nThis show will make you die of laughter (guaranteed)\r\nThe story is about Kazuma Satou, a high school student, gamer and shut-in, died on an average day walking home from school, performing the one heroic act of his life. He reawakens in the afterlife, greeted by a beautiful but rude girl named Aqua, who claims to be a goddess that guides the youth whose lives got cut short. Aqua then offers him a choice: to go to heaven, or to get sent to a another world to defeat the Demon King. Of course, Kazuma's gamer instincts kick in, and he choosesto start a new life in a real-life RPG.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you first reed the synopsis you have this idea that it would be like strong/overpowered character who will save the town from enemies with his sword. But no, this is not happening. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe show differentiate itself from other RPG shows with its kinda weak characters. This is not your typical RPG who's characters are the strongest and always prove themselves and save the world. If you like weak characters doing tasks to collect money and laugh your ass off without taking it seriously, watch this. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story like I said above not your typical RPG show and its funny, new and amazing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe most thing you will like about KonoSuba is the characters, each character has their own personality that will make it hard to choose the best one between them. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation style is good and of course there are boobs. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks in KonoSuba match the show with the funny vibes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this show, It's one of my favs this season and can't wait for season 2! \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Once in a while, there will be that one show where you look at it and think \"this looks terrible and clich\u00e9d\", why should I want to see this? But from experience, anime should never be judged solely by its cover.\r\nFor instance, something like Madoka Magica is known for how well it managed to go far beyond the expectations of what it appeared to be, but you don't have to completely alter the direction of the presentation to make it good, simply make an entertaining show to dissuade middling first impressions. That's where a show like Konosuba comes in.\r\nYou might look at the art fora second and think \\n\r\n\"this will just be an average fantasy harem with nothing new to offer\". And that is where you'd be wrong, very wrong, as Konosuba is a show that manages to be surprisingly hilarious in spite of what it seems to be, and maintains consistently solid quality to make it a highlight of the early 2016 Winter Anime season.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Konosuba is a simple one, but ultimately a story that's filled with ideas you might thing are only there to satisfy fantasy wish fulfillment, but really go the complete opposite route. The main plot is about a 13 year old shut in named Kazuma who ends up dying trying to prevent a girl from being run over by a moving vehicle. It's only when he wakes up with a smirking goddess sitting atop him that you get the idea of what the show seems to be, but then proceeds to subvert. The moving vehicle was just a small tractor, and Kazuma died out of shock that he would die as opposed to actually being run over. \\n\\n\r\nThe first real taste of what the show is comes when he's given a choice of what to take into the fantasy world beyond death, and he takes the goddess herself, named Aqua, and she, to say the least, isn't enthusiastic about being stuck in a world of dead mortals and monsters. The rest of the show follows this particular comedy style, stretch ideas to their absolute limit, subvert obvious expectations, and manage to be mean-spirited in a way that contrasts the very pretty setting, but still doesn't go so far as to alienate the audience from what comes next. \\n\\n\r\nHumor, however, is subjective, so if you aren't a fan of subversive/meta/hope dashing/ humor you might not like this show. But it never stays on one course, only getting crazier and crazier for Kazuma and Aqua as the show exploits its setting for all it's worth. Expect the unexpected every time. It's a show where if you don't like the first 1 or 2 episodes, you won't enjoy the rest, but personally I really enjoyed this interesting comedy style I'd previously only seen in works like The Amazing World of Gumball or Kid Icarus: Uprising\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nIf you want something to pick on, it's the art. The overall animation doesn't really do anything that new or unique, and some moments definitely do lack the finer polish of more expert works, to the point of lacking finesse on plenty of occasions. Some facial expressions also make their way into weird territory, and what gets to these is odd. \\n\r\nIn a way though, the art not doing much contributes to the charm. The setting still looks fairly pretty and some of the magic effects used by the main characters are polished well enough. CG has decent value. Not great, but fair enough and it doesn't drag the show down too much.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nLike the art, the sound doesn't really show for much new, but it accommodate the style well. The opening and ending are largely alright, but the background music (or occasionally lack thereof) contributes well to both the comedic dilemmas and what's going through a character's mind. Megumin for instance gets seemingly epic opera chants whenever she gets confident in her explosions, and it doesn't always pan out in an epic way. Like the art, it's nothing new, but it suits the style.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhat really makes this show subvert expectations and stand out are the characters. Some would assume that the MC being with several girls would be every guy's dream. Not in this case, where the primary joke is how impractical they really are and how it turns the MC's life into a post-living nightmare stuck in this other world. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the MC, Kazuma himself is someone you'd expect to be bland, basic, overly nice, overconfident and good hearted. But he's not. Kazuma is quite frankly a total smartass, and doesn't really value his teammates when it comes down to it. Where the show takes his rather condescending attitude is again, part of the comedy. On the other hand though, his actions never go so far as to be totally unrealistic and in that sense, he provides a great amount of understanding with the audience because, quite frankly, getting constantly frustrated, feeling the need to be towering above others, wanting to do something for selfish pleasure, and outsmarting anyone who crosses you would be very common for the group he's meant to represent. It never gives him too much without kicking him where it hurts, and never drags on suffering for it to feel like too much. The balance makes the character work.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, you have his three teammates he ends up with. Totally dysfunctional party crashers. \\n\\n\r\nFirst you have Aqua, the goddess Kazuma stole from her high throne to take along with him. She has adorable moments, but is also incredibly attention seeking, overdramatic, and has high power, but at the expense of common sense. That she's often condescending subverts her cute appearance, and like with Kazuma, the show will do a lot at her expense over its run. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's Megumin, the Arch Mage and my personal favorite of the group. She has extremely powerful explosion magic...but can only use it once a day, then becomes incapacitated. So Awesome, but Impractical. She has a lot of dramatic flair, and her voice actress does a great job of pulling off her dramatic moments. There's a lot less to her expense, but how the show uses its meta/subversion comedy style still falls into effect.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, there's Darkness, an incredibly durable Knight with high stats...but she can't actually hit a target for anything. She's also treats pain in a...more enjoyable way than most. However, this isn't her whole character as the contrast between honorable knight and masochist makes her character feel like a character rather than a one note Butt Monkey. All three of them ultimately make it far worse for Kazuma than better, but they do grow closer by going through all this together. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone else basically fits their part in the comedy, from the \"I just want to be noticed\" headless horseman, the incredibly by the book legendary hero, a thief girl, and a couple of the monsters met along the way, which have bigger roles than you'd think in their episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say Konosuba is a solid watch that maintains consistent quality. The comedy may not be for everyone, and many elements of the show fit themselves to that comedy style, but the way the show is presented in contrast to your expectations made this show worth a watch. It's only 10 episodes, so it won't take up that much time, and Konosuba is something that'll likely stick in your head with how everything was handled.",

Well, there are a lot of pros for this anime but there are a few cons, such as it being too short, therefore the plot felt rushed and it ended up negating the fact that there is now no plot and just comedy which kinda ticked me off a bit.\r\nthe transition from eps 8 to 9 and 10 was a bit like..... too much transition, we needed more, it just like SUDDENLY HAPPENED. Well, for those who like comedy, this is definitely the goto anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty amazing, nothing really much to complain here. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP i guess was okay and the ED was pretty bad. espeicially with how sesaon 1 ended, then all the sudden ED theme plays, it just didnt feel right of a transition. the ED in my opinion does not go well with the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, i enjoyed this anime, so many laughs and stuff. i would not recommend to those who want an actual story plot, this is an anime for those who want to have a bit of a giggle.",

This is totally irrelevant to readers, but it astounded me right after watching Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu that there was another anime that had somewhat of a similar feeling in the beginning -- this one more comical of course. Back to my point. Overall, I enjoyed watching this anime as it gave a good deals amount of laughter and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good laugh. The development of the storyitself should not be taken seriously as the main core of the anime seems to be how they rally up their jokes and execute them. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 7/10\\n\r\nA bit contradictory with a rating this fairly high to what I said above (the anime being less story oriented and more focused on executing jokes), but its story development still did aid in the jokes and overall comedic feel of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\r\nSelf-explanatory. From the thumbnails it would be obvious that the art would be good. Good, but not great, nor outstanding. Just good enough to pass the heightened expectations of anime viewers of the modern day. Just enough to pass as a standard.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9/10\\n\r\nI wouldn't have praised this anime for its comedy if not for how they developed and introduced its characters. I got most of my laughs from the Crusader because she really did twist a lot of situations around in a comedic manner. Every significant character contributed to the story, so I thought that they did a good job there.",

As stated in the synopsis the goal of the main characters here is to \"defeat the Demon King\" and they could not be more ill-suited for the job.  I once heard this show described as \"the resulting Dungeons and Dragons campaign from a group of drunk assholes who are doing everything in their power to derail the Dungeon Master's intricate story.\"  I also once heard the show referred to \"It's Always Sunny: The Anime.\"  Both of thesedescriptions are very apropos, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:  \\n\r\nThe facial expressions in this show are absolutely perfect.  Every emotion is expertly shown on the faces of the characters and you really get a feel for things like a character's disbelief or disgust even when no words are exchanged.  \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:  \\n\r\nI think what makes the audio really stick out in this anime is that you can really tell that the voice actors/ actresses really enjoyed working on this show.  There isn't really anything else to it.  There is no music that really sticks out but the dialogue is really is delivered very well so I think that can be forgiven.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10:  \\n\r\nThe characters are all incredibly well rounded and interesting and, perhaps most importantly, they all have great natural chemistry and every interaction with these characters feels genuine and is absolutely entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10:  \\n\r\nWatching the four main characters play off of each other to create a natural feeling comedy was fun.  There were a few scenes I found really funny but the entire show had me sensibly chuckling the whole way though.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10:  \\n\r\nThis show is a fun sitcom comedy, but also an anime.  And it was fun.  When I sat down to watch it I watched through every episode in one sitting and I regret nothing.",

            "content": "KonoSuba takes the standard premise of a regular japanese NEET being sent into a fantasy world to quest and adds a twist - he was given the option of taking any single thing or person with him by the goddess of the afterlife, but the goddess was so insensitive to his plight that he decided to spite her by bringing her along. It's a smart idea, and the predictable jokes that result, focusing on how the goddess is actually fairly incompetent and unhelpful, are pulled off well, but it doesn't live up to the comic potential of its premise.\r\nMost of the comedy in KonoSuba comesfrom the characters, who are all incompetent and delusional in different ways, with the protagonist - Kazuma - usually serving as the straight man, trying to stay alive when their idiocy makes all his missions go tits-up. Aside from that, some of it comes from Kazuma himself, with his cunning rule-breaking approach to solving problems in this RPG world, as he lies and cheats with merry cynicism in order to get money, level up, and defeat the Devil King. The setting itself is completely generic, and almost no attempt is made to mine humour from it or make it more specific and interesting. \\n\\n\r\nEpisodes usually follow the pattern of Kazuma and his team accepting a quest after some initial bickering, assuming it's going to be fairly straightforward, before it goes sideways on them and they have to improvise in order to win. The epilogue usually involves them losing the money they earned in some way, either to pay off debts or pay for the damages they made while fighting, so they go back to square one. With that obvious lack of development (although some incremental progress is made - they do each get slightly stronger and more accomplished), the show needs to be smarter and more engaging than it is to really work, but it's consistently funny enough to never actually be bad.",

However is still a very good anime, with a little disappointment of \u201cIs that all?\u201d. Even for a non-declared Slice of Life disguised in an RPG adventure anime I expected more plot. Maybe is my fault, to think that would follow the same idea of another RPG adventure anime of the same year. Without further ado let\u2019s go to the review:\r\n---Story---\r\nActually the only disappointment in this anime. I really hope for an actual and good adventure plot (maybe because another anime in this year failed in such issue), but we all receivea compilation of side events that reveals a funny Slice of Life show. I do not wait for an outcome for the Demon King saga, or even a city changing. Besides that it\u2019s a good (really good) comedy anime, avoiding as many cliches you can imagine and making you laugh when you didn\u2019t expect to, not mentioning that Chuunnibyo reference. WANA NA WA MEGUMIN .\\n\\n\r\n---Animation\u2014\\n\r\nVery beautiful. The light on the face when Kazuma dies, the starred sky, that DNA animation (that was impressing), the ending that\u2019s fantastic, those EKKUSUPUROSHIONS. It\u2019s a massage to the eyes, cool and clean. It\u2019s not an Attack on Titans animation, but it\u2019s still great.\\n\\n\r\n---Characters--\\n\r\nActually the main attraction of the show for me. Every relevant character with unique traits and personalities, that only reading the subtitles you can find out who said this or that. A good development of their relationships that makes everybody an important piece of the story, without aside characters nor sidekicks.\\n\\n\r\n---Sound---\\n\r\nCheerful opening and ending, bringing to you the spirit of a funny and joyful world. Another good sound spec is the singular soundtrack of every girl in the show. Darkness have her own song to their masochists delusions, which is funny and, somehow, sexy, as Megumin have and also Aqua have. The songs are well planned, and well executed too, like when Aqua and Kazuma were sucked to that \u201cSubarashii Sekai\u201d, their voices distorted as they has distanced themselves, this effect is logical, of course, but it was well made in an impressive way.\\n\\n\r\n---Enjoyment---\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a comedy show to a comedy fan, so the enjoyment is guaranteed. In short it\u2019s the perfect anime to spend a good time relaxing and laughing, not a masterpiece, but certainly an anime that should be re watched.\\n",

            "content": "Konosuba is a nice anime to watch if you're not in the mood for anything deep, depressing, emotional, serious, etc.. If you just want to laugh, smile, and not think too deeply for a while, then this is an anime for you. Join a lovely party reminiscent of a D&D group or a party from any major RPG as the main characters go about struggling to survive on a day to day basis to escape hunger, fight not-so-terrible monsters, and face off against the most fearsome nemesis of all: debt! \r\nSo is Konosuba worth watching?\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nFor a comedic experience, the story was fine for whatit was. The story has a pretty standard setup from the start. Our first main character, Kazuma, is a NEET who suddenly dies in an accident, gets the option to reincarnate in an RPG/fantasy world, and accepts the task of slaying the generic-sounding Demon King to stop the evils of this fantasy world and eventually forms a party with a goddess, an archmage, and a crusader to do so. While this premise sounds bland, as the story progresses you start to see a ridiculous RPG world where you can't help but want to watch what happens next. One notable thing with the story is that a lot of actions and events are connected, coming back in the story later either as small jokes or a hilarious consequence of the party's actions, which I find makes this world come more alive and vibrant as things aren't just done and forgotten right after. Where the story does fall short is virtually no progression with the main quest, but their focus on the characters lives and daily interactions make up for some of the story's short comings and doesn't hurt the show at all. One thing that did detract from the story was a few time skips later in the series that yank from experience and had the viewer filling in some big story gaps.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt+Sound: 8/10\\n\r\nFor a story set in a fantasy world, you have colorful art where everything is bright and wonderful. It is not very detailed and if you are familiar with the stories about Studio DEEN you might come to a negative conclusion for the art+animation before viewing, but the comedy fits the art+animation well and the art actually helps emphasis it. There is some art+animation that is awful (such as awkward jiggling boobs), but for the important stuff (Megumin's EXPLOSION and people's reactions) it works perfectly so that you can ignore the bad stuff and focus on the comedy. SFX and sound isn't super either, but the voice acting for this was superb and really helped drive the comedy. The OP isn't great, but sets a happy viewing expectation. The ED was better and has a nice homely feel to it to send the viewer (for me at least) longing for more of this world.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(s): 9/10\\n\r\nThis is where the show really shines! Every character is designed with certain skills and personality where separately they'd be unremarkable and questionable, but in a party dynamic they clash and this creates much of the comedy in Konosuba. We have...\\n\\n\r\nKazuma: above average intelligence, very lucky, and naturally takes the leadership role in the party, but has no natural skills and is the weakest of the party. He has the most common sense out of anyone here and is an asshole to anyone who annoys him or pisses him off, which is pretty much all of his party members.\\n\r\nAqua: a literal goddess with powerful holy spells and maxed out stats, but her only lacking skill is below average intelligence and terrible luck. Her intelligence stat reflects on her actual intelligence and she's basically an air-head and her bad luck can drag the party down with her.\\n\r\nMegumin: the archmage of this party to help the party deliver massive spell damage, but she only knows one spell (explosion!) and using it will physically incapacitate her for the day. She is obsessed with maximizing her explosion spell's power, refusing to learn any other useful spells.\\n\r\nDarkness: a crusader and the party's tank with high damage absorption, but she is unable to hit anything. She's also a masochist and would throw herself into the heat of battle just to get hurt, ignoring any planning or preparation the party might have planned.\\n\\n\r\nNow throw them together into a party and this is just a comedy goldmine where everything that can go wrong... will pretty much go immediately wrong from the start. Despite the party's flaws, in critical moments, Kazuma's quick thinking (and his high luck) will push the party forward, though in all other moments the viewers will laughs at the party's antics and failures as they struggle to improve and become better people. Despite the party wanting to improve, there is very little in character development. However, this show doesn't scream for any characters to grow so I can let that slide. In fact, the comedy does well to keep everyone more or less the same and just focus on their interactions with one another and it's those interactions where we do see some insights into everyone and a little character development come from it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nKonosuba and its comedy may not be for everyone (different strokes for different folks), but I throughly enjoyed it from start to finish. If you can ignore the lackluster art+animation and lack of story progression, this is definitely a recommended watch for comedy. There are also some time skips as I mentioned earlier, but considering that this had to be condensed into 10 episodes, I can let that slide. If you find yourself wanting more Konosuba, have no fear for season 2 was announced for Winter 2017. Rejoice!\\n\\n\r\nThanks for the read!\\n\\n",

            "content": "STORY - 8\r\nART - 10\r\nSOUND - 9\r\nCHARACTER - 9\r\nENJOYMENT - 9\r\nWell, if you really are wondering what an anime would look like if it takes on the MMORPG genre in a hilarious fashion where all kinds of logic gets thrown out of the window, then KonoSuba emerges. My room was filled with confusing laughters watching this anime.\r\nWhat you get from this show isn't overly complicated. They were aiming for the goal to nitpick, tease, and make fun of other isekais out there in a friendly way. And no, in case you were thinking wrongly, it doesn't rudely look down upon other anime of the sameparallel setting, a fantasy world of quests or magic or guilds or all kinds of similar elements out there (and cute girls too). It instead does it through a pretty mean and different way, where the poor male main character undergoes all kinds of situations that was just totally out of whack to what he was expecting. Seeing him slowly getting drained out of all the stressful events he experienced was very amusing to watch. It also didn't helped that his allies of girls were pretty much a bundle of outgoing strangeness that made his situation even more of a continuous wave of sufferings after sufferings. Their funny personalities matched flawlessly with each other, having interactions that'll make you chortle close to a laughable and pathetic death just like the male MC. Anyways, the base factor that made this anime so entertaining was definitely because of the characters. The world isn't really built much, and you won't get to see a rich environment full of intriguing things as it's pretty much a lighthearted, goofy show. Every episode is split into short scenes that slowly progressed towards the main goal of defeating the Demon King, but the seriousness of the threats took on a comical approach so there were no sense of danger whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, the take on the audiovisual were quite superb to say the least. It really assisted the simple, comedic story in making the anime more entertaining because of the great visuals. Oh but firstly, maybe the animation can be kind of cringy during the more fanservicey scenes with all the unrealistic physics of jiggles and blah blah blah. It's animated well though, it's just that it was a bit too over the top for my taste. That aside, the fluidity aided the bright and colorful art style during all kinds of scenes. Comedy? Exaggeration and humorous facial expressions so check! Magic powers? Nice use of colors and effects portraying a beautiful set of abilities so check! Studio Deen also went one more step in making the characters not blandly talking while standing still, you know, like moving the mouth boringly that rejects all sorts of entertainment. This anime made the interactions between characters more engaging in a dynamic manner, not going with the statue-like poses found in other anime but having the bodily movements more lively and brimming with silly energy. And with energy, comes with it loudness. Hilarity ensued as each characters shout at each other, spewing out illogical nonsense from the girls, or deafened common sense from the pitiable male MC. Every dialogues were enjoyable with the passion coming from the voice actors. I don't know this but I feel like they had a lot of fun during their session voicing the characters to bring out enjoyment. Soundtracks also fits the friendly tone, along with the opening and ending song that were filled with a delightful atmosphere for the fantasy theme.\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba was simply so outrageous in terms of an MMORPG-related entertainment that I can't help but feel that it managed to win my heart over. While the darker, more serious anime fills you with addicting adrenaline, this anime pumps in an equally addicting amount of euphoria-inducing dopamine into you with a fresh source of absurd characters, simple comedy setting, and a radiating audiovisual. Added up together and it becomes a refreshing relaxation to just let all your laughs and pressures out of your body.",

            "content": "I think I know my tastes in anime pretty well and so when a friend recommended this show to me, I said I\u2019d check it out but was pretty certain that I\u2019d drop the show by the first episode. And going through approximately half the first episode, I\u2019d considered it. \r\nThe main character, Kazuma, with his very basic and unappealing attire, seemed to me to be another uninspired neet archetype, and the goddess he meets, Aqua, was also, at first, seemed to be some video-game-fantasy type archetype to please the male otaku audience that this anime is targeted towards. However, through their interaction, I realizedthat although what I\u2019d said about the archetypes was partially true, what was also true is that there is a very healthy dose of self-awareness and fun. Aqua laughs maniacally at Kazuma\u2019s fate and Kazuma is dumbstruck at his own fate and the frivolousness of Aqua, not at all how he envisioned a goddess. And Kazuma, as petty as he is, decides to go to the fantasy world, and asks to take Aqua. Now, Aqua is terrified, and even starts comically crying and distorting her face, with excellent animation to make sure the watcher knows it's all fun, while also setting up a sort of give and take motif that Kazuma and Aqua will have, usually with Aqua acting sort of prissy, and Kazuma ignoring her, and Aqua crying to Kazuma. The relationship can get a bit repetitive but with the addition of other characters and their own fairly specific relationship with Kazuma, what is created is an anime with a bunch of fun, well animated gags with the occasional battle here and there to show off the animation as well as move the plot/introduce new characters. There is never really any real progression in the characters nor any crazy or particularly important changes in the plot, but I found this to be a good thing, and made for a show that was very very easy to watch and just enjoy without too much thinking and in that sense reminded me of Fumoffu!, both shows having a very high potential replay value.\\n",

            "content": "Kono Suba, oh how much fun you've been.  I had a really hard time rating this show, as a parody changes the dynamic for story and characters.  KonoSuba almost tries to revel in how much of an anti-story it is, in fact.  Let's break it down and see where this show ends up:\r\nStory (7/10) - So out of the gate we already have a difficult category.  The story is rather bare-bones in KonoSuba and based on an classic generic \"trapped in a video game world\" setup.  There isn't necessarily a whole lot of world building, and it doesn't even reallymove anywhere.  For most shows, this would be a huge hindrance to the story, but KonoSuba's parody-like nature changes the meaning behind it all.  KonoSuba isn't meant to tell a grand story of danger and adventure, it is meant to mock the tropes it is built on and the glory of the hero's journey.  The fact that the story can be at times episodic and not necessarily lead anywhere is the whole point.  The life of an adventurer isn't always straightforward, often times your journey meanders and you lose your way and even get stalled.  The story ends up providing a serviceable backdrop for our characters to act out their shenanigans, and at least a bit of a direction and progression for the characters.  It provides plenty of room for gags and insane happen-stance, without being bogged down by some grand message.  It gives the characters a great canvas to paint on and interesting colours to choose from.  As a result it is a good story as far as parodies go, not anything spectacular, but a solid base to expand on.\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10) - Art was certainly this shows weakest point, but as with the story, that isn't always as straightforward as it seems.  Many times the simpler and \"derpy\" animation actually worked to the benefit of the show, enhancing the silliness of reaction faces and greatly exaggerating the characters at their worst and best.  And despite the occasional poor instance of art, the show did have its moments of brilliance, especially when it came to characters casting magical abilities.  The character designs themselves were solid and enjoyable to see.  They felt very warm and comforting at times and Megumin was just outright adorable!  For any other show this score would have been below average due to some severe drops in animation quality, a 3-4 out of 10; however, because it works so well with the theme and style of the show, be it intentional or not by DEEN, and because I was quite partial to the character designs, it gets a respectable 6/10 for it.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10) - The sound in this show was fairly strong.  The opening and ending songs were fantastic and exceptionally comfy and I always enjoyed hearing them at the end of a long and tiring day.  The music throughout the show itself was rather uninspired, repetitive, and minimal, so I have to dock a point for missed potential there.  Most importantly though, for a parody to work well in anime, the Voice Acting is absolutely key to success, and the VA work for KonoSuba delivered.  Sora Amamiya absolutely nailed crybaby Aqua, and newcomer Rie Takahashi was excellent as Megumin, really lending that Chuuni goodness and gravitas Megumin required in her speeches while keeping her down to earth and adorable the rest of the time.  Jun Fukushima really played a good Kazuma as well, providing the perfect amount of snark and timing needed for the role.  The supporting cast was also fairly good, especially the girls in the Succubus den, but there were times where they weren't up to par, rare times.  Had the sound been filled out a bit more, this could very easily have been a 9 though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10) - The characters in this show were absolutely mint.  They were fantastic in every sense of the word.  Aqua was so good as an annoying pain in the ass that I somehow couldn't help but feel some platonic affection towards, which is some kind of magic in and of itself.  Megumin was so, so adorable and you could really see her fluctuation in confidence despite the show she would put on.  Darkness grew a little bit stale at parts, but was nonetheless a presence on the screen when desired. Kazuma was just a fantastic sarcastic jerk, and even all of the side cast where generally very interesting.  All their fun background expressions, all the interesting character designs, and all of the fun interactions of the characters were just so fresh feeling.  I could't help but walk away from every episode feeling attached to these characters in some way or another.  You didn't necessarily see them grow a whole lot, but that isn't the point of this show.  They weren't necessarily there to change themselves throughout the story, even though they did to a small degree, they were there to engage you.  I think they absolutely succeeded in that regard nearly from enthusiasm alone!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) - By far the easiest category to rate.  If I could give this show an 11 for enjoyment, I would, because it was so much fun.  Very rarely did I find myself bored in this show.  Nearly all of the jokes landed, and I just had a smile plastered across my face for every episode.  I couldn't help but get invested in our pathetic quartet of heroes and really enjoyed watching them grow as a group rather than just individuals.  Their mutual camaraderie and affection was something truly missing from a lot of shows, even despite each of their faults.  At times it really felt like I was just watching a group of my idiot friends fail miserably at an MMO dungeon, and I loved every second of it.\\n\\n\r\nSo finally we come to my overall impressions of the show and it's impressive score of 8 out of 10.  The best way I can think to compare KonoSuba is to mention another favourite comedy of mine \"The Devil is a Part-Timer\".  Both shows nail their respective comedic parts, but Devil does it with a bit more polished animation and story depth.  KonoSuba is significantly weaker in this regard, but there's one thing KonoSuba has going for it that Devil just doesn't come close to: unbridled enthusiasm.  Yeah, KonoSuba didn't have the best art or even the makings of a well-defined story, but it had so much heart and spirit that I couldn't help but fall in love with it.  It isn't quite a 9/10 show, but I really, really wish I could have given it such a score because of how much fun I had watching it.  It is one of the most genuinely endearing comedy shows I've seen, and I greatly look forward to more material from it.",

            "content": "I might as well join the influx of people reviewing Konosuba immediately after it finishes airing.\r\nKonosuba took me by surprise, I was not expecting an actually funny show from something that reads: Studio deen, light novel, and has a premise that sounds exactly like generic otaku empowerment fantasy. Turns out it's basically a parody of the \"stuck in a video game\" genre.\r\n-Presentation (sound & visuals)\r\nThere's nothing for me to really complain about, this show has some obvious CG in it which still didn't really look out of place to me. As for music, I found the OP and ED pretty catchy, the rest of thesoundtrack was mostly forgettable though.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters\\n\r\nEveryone from the villains to the main cast is a complete derp, and that's a big part of what makes this show so funny.\\n\r\nWhile the cast does have nice interaction and some funny quirks, I would've liked to see some more actual character development.\\n\r\nEvery character would at first glance fit some archetype, but it quickly becomes apparent \\n\r\nthere's a bit more going on.\\n\\n\r\n-Story\\n\r\nKonosuba is a very episodic anime which will likely never actually have an actual ending.\\n\r\nThe series starts off strong, constantly bringing new jokes to the table and builds up the rest of the story. As the sory progresses it starts to be carried by the new characters introduced every episode, after which I felt like I had seen basically everything that the show has to offer, but towards the end it got better for me.\\n\r\nAnd speaking of the end, I'm not sure if episode 9 could be considered filler because it's basically a fan service episode and mostly pointless otherwise.\\n\r\nAlso second season announced (woo!).\\n\\n\r\n-Conclusion\\n\r\nKonosuba is so far the best anime I have watched this season, though Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu might replace it once I actually start watching it.\\n\r\nShows like SAO and Danmachi make Konosuba more relevant, but it could stand by itself even if those shows never aired.\\n\r\nYou might have problems liking this show, if the humor is just not your type, if you really dislike \\n\r\nfan service or you just don't like episodic anime that much.\\n\r\nOtherwise I would say it's a worthwhile watch.",

So I decided to try it.\r\nI was expecting something like Log Horizion for this anime.\r\nAfter finishing the anime I realized.\r\nThis anime is nothing like Log Horizon, SAO.\r\nWhat i see from this anime is this is how it would really be if a guy actually went into a mmorpg world.\r\nThis issomething that you can see from the main character. The main character is every otaku that would act if they went into a world like this.\\n\\n\r\nThis is turn made the comedy really good.\\n\\n\r\nWe have our other 3 female main character who have personalities that make the humor even greater.   *Megumin best girl of 2016*\\n\\n\r\nThis anime does have a plot to it but its put at the side to focus on other \"side-quests\" which is something I was kinda disappointed by but then you have to realize.\\n\\n\r\nThe main focus of this anime is comedy and it's very good at it (but ones sense of humor is subjective)\\n\\n\r\nI find the art of this anime terrible.

Story not so \"Great\" for now but have a direction to be \"Great\" in the future. Funny? Yes. For me one of the anime that makes me laugh even if the character look seriousto what they say.

As a result, we got a lot of titles that moves in that domain, among them is Konosuba. Konosuba is one of those animes that revolves around the MMO and takes itas its center, but not in the usual way that other stories tried to, it is mostly making fun out of it and some of its family-relative parodies.\\n\\n\r\nSooooooooo . . . did Konosuba succeed in it? HELL YEAH!! and with an EXPLOSION!! This anime is funny and WILL make you laugh, it is not original but it is fresh. As the synopsis says or reads, our MC dies and gets sent to a phantasy world (by his choice), and to his surprise the life he expected to meet wasn't there and the life he said goodbye was there instead (as in he is going to live our normal real life in a virtual world).\\n\\n\r\nBack to the point, why do you have to watch this show? It is funny . . . anything else? IT IS FUNNY. Characters, situations, lines and everything will cheer you up and make laugh, not only that, but to those who have watched a lot of shows and are getting bored or down, this will fuel you up. And now to the marking:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nIf we consider jokes, fun and making fun as a story, then Konosuba is with the perfect story because you will laugh (though if you look at it from a different angle, joking animes have no real stories so . . .)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful, colorful and explosionful, and that is surprising for an anime this short.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI am kinda picky about this part in any anime, as I believe that what my ears recieve will be the deciding factor for how good an anime is. Soundtracks and Seiyuus are the corner stine of any anime to me, and the corner stone of Konosuba is made of Diamond. The voice actors fit there characters so much and the ost is something of perfection (especially the ED :') love it)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nWon't say much here, I mean how can I love this anime so much if it wasn't for it's characters . . . and explosions.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nAfter all what I wrote, you can guess how much I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nThough there is an 8 score in there, I decided to give the over all a full 10 (just because I love Shaft's art styles won't make me mean). I recommand and order any anime lover to watch this, as it was approved by Michael Bay and Einstein for the EXPLOSION this anime caused this season.\\n\\n\r\nHmm, I wrote a lot than expacted, must be Megumin's love \\n\r\n(excuse typos if there is any)",

            "content": "After the releases of such shows like Sword Art Online and Log Horizon, many isekai (trapped in another world) anime have come and go throughout the recent years. One of these anime is a little comedy show known as \"Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!\" (God's Blessing on This Wonderful World!) aka Konosuba for short. This is probably if not, the best comedy anime to come out in recent years.\r\nSTORY: 7/10\r\nAfter dying in a pathetic death, a NEET named Kazuma gets transported to a fantasy world along with the goddess Aqua. Together along with a mage called Megumin and a knight called Darkness go onmisadventures in the new world. With the new wave of isekai shows, the story can be a bit unoriginal. It is quite plain, almost to the fact that it sounds boring. The episodes can also very episodic, which means a new adventure for nearly every single episode. However, this is what makes Konosuba, well, Konosuba. It is plain, simple, yet it's absolutely hilarious. The comedy is gold and is very enjoyable. Konosuba is probably an anime homage to western cartoons and sitcoms which are known for their comedy. The biggest problem with the story is that it only has 10 episodes to tell the story. Only 10 freaking episodes to tell the whole story!\\n\\n\r\nCAST: 9/10\\n\r\nThis show has probably one of the most comedic cast of characters I've ever seen. The main characters at first looks like your average female harem cast with every anime cliche you can find. But there are more to them than meets the eye. Starting with Kazuma, despite looking like your average light novel MC, he plays as the straight/sane person of the group contrasting to the insane girls. Aqua is a spoiled brat that can be annoying at times, but she is one of the few who is funny and enjoyable. Darkness looks like the heroic type of character, but she is a total masochist who enjoys a lot of pain through fighting. Rounding of the MCs is the best girl Megumin, a loli chunnibiyo known for her explosion magic and is the most mesmerizing character in the whole series. The supporting cast can be either memorable or forgettable depending on your taste. Basically most of the characters are destroyed cliches, and that's what makes them memorable and fun.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: 7/10\\n\r\nKonosuba was produced by Studio Deen. I've seen clips of their shows like Higurashi and to be honest, their animation can be somewhat average. The same can be said to Konosuba. But much like the story, it may be plain, yet it's very hilarious. At times it can get a bit cartoonish just for laughs, but it is one of the few anime that does it right. The show is also very colorful and it clearly matches the style of the show. This makes the characters look more interesting, unique and fun. The setting however, can be either unique or just plain simple, like the whole town itself is pretty much like every fantasy anime out there. \\n\\n\r\nMUSIC: 9/10\\n\r\nThe OP (Fantastic Dreamer by Machico) may sound like your average Jpop opening but when you watch it, it is very fun and hilarious to watch. The ED (Little Adventurer by Aqua, Megumin and Darkness) is very plain and mellow, yet very nice and calming to listen after watching the craziness of the characters. It is not often for an anime to have a western country/folk song for their OP or ED. In fact, Konosuba may be the only anime that has one. \\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING: 10/10\\n\r\nThe biggest standout of the anime is the voice acting. Along with a similar anime called ReZero, Konosuba was one of the first subbed anime I've watched (since I prefer watching dubs and please don't kill me or anything). The voices fit perfectly with the characters. Like Sora Amamiya (known in Akame ga Kill and Tokyo Ghoul) who's very hilarious as Aqua, Ai Kayano (known in No Game No Life and Anohana) who suprisingly gives a deep voice as Darkness, and of course Rie Takahashi (known in ReZero) as everyone's favorite waifu Megumin. Will I see this show dubbed in the future? Who knows? I might not watch it dubbed at all since the Japanese is already too good.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\r\nKonosuba may not be a masterpiece, but it is still a fun, lighthearted, very entertaining show. With memorable characters, colorful animation and lots of outstanding slapstick comedy, Konosuba is definitely worth the watch and is indeed one of the best anime in 2016.\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n+ One of the best isekai shows out there\\n\r\n+ It destroys character cliches making the cast very memorable\\n\r\n+ Animation is very bright and colorful\\n\r\n+ A fun opening and a unique ending song \\n\r\n+ Voice acting is spot on\\n\r\n+ The comedy, just the comedy\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n- The story is too plain and may turn off viewers\\n\r\n- Animation at times can be a bit meh\\n\r\n- The supporting cast is mostly forgotten\\n\r\n- If this was dubbed then it may not be good as the sub\\n\r\n- How many isekai shows are there!? \\n\r\n- And come on, only 10 episodes!?\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\r\nSound : 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAlso, thank Aqua for a second season since 10 episodes ain't enough!",

            "content": "The post SAO era of anime saw a huge spike in high fantasy shows with an MMO setting, while most of them are of a similar ilk with copy-and-paste plot and characters, Konosuba managed to strike at a comedy niche that made it stood out from the crowd.\r\nYou can expect the usual mix of stereotypes and plot clich\u00e9s commonly associated with the genre, but instead of embracing them with open arms, Konosuba mocks them at every opportunity with witty writing to boot. Instead of an intricate plot with extensive lore, we were treated to the daily struggles of lowly adventurers. Instead of a looming senseof fate and destiny, we were treated with kill quests of giant toads and magical cabbages. Instead of a goody-two-shoes protagonist, we were treated to an egotistical shut-in that\u2019s mostly out for himself, introduced in the humblest manner possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were well designed and written, each member of the main party were peculiar in their own ways with various eccentricities. Discussing them here might spoil the plot so I will refrain from going into detail, but Kazuma was definitely one of the best protagonist I\u2019ve seen as of late, while Megumin was memorable with her chuuni aesthetics and obsessive passion of \u201cmagic\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nArt is brilliant for the most part, there were little reuse of frames besides a few seconds of guild announcements and townsfolk dashing for shelters. Animation is smooth and expressive, close-in shots of characters were often detailed and fitting. The spell sequences especially looked the part with no expanses spared, I was glad that the same consistent level of quality was kept throughout the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to nitpick, I would say 10 episodes were too short for the show\u2019s own good. Granted that it had to be done for prevent a single gag from being overly drawn, among other budget related reasons. However some small parts were cut from the light novels, namely the introduction of Wiz, which inevitably damaged the shows pacing at times. The musical scores were a tad underwhelming too, none of the tracks were memorable or impressive, though the OP and ED were adorable and appropriate.\\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt, this show was a highlight of 2016 and a must see. I have enjoyed the entirety of it, every episode from start to finish. It is also one of those shows that\u2019s highly rewatchable, the type that you can leave running every other month and steal a peek while you\u2019re busy doing stuff. Seriously, you should stop reading this and watch it already.",

            "content": "I actually really liked KonoSuba. Yes, it isn't the most hilarious, unique, or the wittiest show around, but it does what it is supposed to and with aplomb. Barring a few pacing issues and occasionally grating character design problems, this is indeed a really good show that is worth your time if you're looking for a show that will give you some good laughs with some entertaining characters and a pretty decent magical/game-world setting.\r\nThe plot synopsis gives barely anything away about what you as a viewer are about to experience. The introductory episode actually sets the tone perfectly for the rest of the series asyou're exposed to the rather unique character interactions that occur in this anime. I'd go so far as to say that if you don't like the first episode, you most likely won't enjoy the rest of this series at all. However, if you do at least think it is decent, prepare for more laughs along the way. There are some truly hilarious characters in this story which are complete parodies of their counterparts in other animes and RPG games. Their strengths and weaknesses truly work together in hilarious fashion which makes for much of the entertainment factor of this show. It does get a little repetitive towards the end of the season, but that's also where the pacing issues occur, so more on that later.\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba looks fairly decent, and the characters sound as funny as you would expect them to. The facial expressions that people make particularly appeal to me and often remind me of Nichijou's funny reaction faces. Of course, the two aren't all that similar, but their method of nailing reactions (that ordinary people like you or I would have) certainly is. The opening song, while decent, is rather forgettable. I did like the ending track and I've been learning how to play it on the guitar, but it doesn't really seem to have any connection to the show itself, unless it is attempting to appeal to the more Slice of Life elements of KonoSuba. The animations aren't exactly that great but the magical special effects are amazingly spectacular. The difference can be a bit jarring at times, but I suppose I'll take this positive for what it is. It also cements Megumi as the best girl.\\n\\n\r\nMy main issues with KonoSuba become prevalent towards the end of the season. First off, why on earth does this have only 10 episodes? A second season was announced at the end of episode 10, so clearly there isn't a dearth of - source material to adapt, funding for more episodes, or popularity for that matter. This show could've benefited GREATLY from even a couple more episodes (to hit 12-13) because around episode 8, there is a random time skip where a whole story arc is left out which can be extremely confusing to figure out at first. I actually had to go back and make sure I hadn't accidentally skipped any episodes. The show does do a decent job of filling the viewer in on what has been missed, but this was totally avoidable and breaks the flow of the anime for me, which is when I get distracted and begin noticing more flaws. Flaws such as the repetition of character-related jokes which were hilarious at first, but become less so once you keep seeing/hearing them over and over again. There are some character development issues as well and one can only hope that the second season will sort this out. Other than that, the main character himself is rather well done and quite relateable. He isn't a typical shut-in, goody-two shoes, or a pushover for that matter, and you can feel his frustration as he has to deal with these useless companions of his. He can be a complete dick towards them at times, but this is more out of exasperation than anything. Which makes him a main character with his unique own personality, and that I commend.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would recommend KonoSuba to you if the thought of a comedy with action, slice-of-life, and game-world (SAO, Log Horizon style) elements interests you. KonoSuba knows what it is and doesn't try to do any more or any less than you'd come to expect from it (other than a few minor gripes mentioned above) and I genuinely enjoyed this show more than I expected to. It's definitely one of the better executed comedies out there. It actually has an okay plot that goes somewhere and moves things along, too. I'd rate this a 7.8/10, rounded off to 8/10. Hope this helps you decide!",

More fantasy impression is strengthened by the use of themes such as the demon king's army, the city sett like in RPG games, do not forget also the presence of adventurers equipped weapons and magic. But the element of fantasy that is just a mask for comedy.Silliness in this anime already in the first witness to appear since the beginning of this anime. In episode one, initially in the show the current scene in which themain character risked their lives to save a girl, it should have a strong emotional impression, precisely made in one punchline comedy in this episode. Death and the \"tragedy\" that in natural Kazuma in the first episode is packed as a comedy, a death in vain for something that is not too important, even according to the recognition Aqua, body Kazuma were brought to the hospital also be made a laughingstock by nurses and his parents.\\n\r\nPayload comedy does not stop in there. After agreeing to move into a fantasy world together with Aqua, Kazuma has a view that the world is like a fantasy world in which ordinary game he played, where he could be a hero, fighting monsters and save the world. But when he got in the world, again come up comedy, which in its reality, Kazuma must live a life of no less annoying in the appeal in the real world. Instead of fighting monsters, Kazuma must live an all-pas-pas along goddess Aqua and friends she met, who would make his life even more miserable. The depiction of a fantasy world that is not as beautiful as what's in the game.\\n\r\nThis KonoSuba anime series brings comedy which does not solely from slapstick scenes as well as a play on words alone. The characters in this anime participated build comedy in this series.

            "content": "[scroll to the bottom for a summary]\r\nIf there's one thing KonoSuba is, it's funny.\r\nIf you're looking for plot, character development or any sort of progression do not watch this show. Stop reading and move on. On the contrary if you want something funny, light-hearted and not too serious then this is probably exactly what you're looking for.\r\nIn recent years there's been a bit of a focus on MMO themed shows and I really appreciate that the producers have tried something different. It's not the same regurgitated content you might expect; instead it's wacky, over the top and doesn't even try to adhere to any ofthe standard MMO tropes. I am perfectly ok with this.\\n\\n\r\nIts biggest asset however is also its biggest downfall. There's a fine line between comedy and stupidity and KonoSuba crosses it ever so slightly. From a general point of view the show suffers from extreme repetition. The same humour is applied throughout and doesn't change. This exhausts its comedic value, making it a little dull and predictable towards the end. Furthermore, past the half way point there's virtually no progression whatsoever. Combining these points kind of makes you wonder what the whole point of watching it was.\\n\\n\r\nFrom a more personal perspective, I think that some of the characters were far too over the top and as a result made them seem stupid and unlikable. Though this is just preference based on my dislike of severely unrealistic characters it's still a valid point to bring up. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is also an issue. Considering the comedic nature of the show I suppose it's not too pressing but the repetitiveness of events + interactions limits any sort of meaningful development.\\n\\n\r\n[Summary]\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that KonoSuba has an average score above 8 genuinely confuses me. While I appreciate the producers tried to do something different with the MMO genre they've executed it really poorly. It's funny to an extent but there's nothing else to it. The comedy continually repeats itself to the point where it's not amusing anymore and there is zero progression of any kind. Even comedy shows have to have some level of plot progression and character development, even if it's not very much. Kobato., for example, is a comedy with a nice story and lots of development (see here http://myanimelist.net/anime/5678/Kobato.).\\n\\n\r\nIf you have any comments/criticisms, please leave me a message or a profile comment as it will help me to write better reviews in the future.

The anime universe is also reasonably well done even though it is not as exploited. KonoSuba's great achievement is not to keep up with forced comedy out of thin air at all times and also not get the same jokes done. An example I can give here is the comedy anime Grand Blue that gets the 12 episodes making fun of drinks and nakedpeople. Another hit from KonoSuba is that he has a focus and keeps it from start to finish: show youngsters on a survival adventure in a magical world.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is very pretty reminding much the American cartoons with their colors very lively and cheerful. The fight scenes are very well done and contain a very smooth animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is not very striking or memorable, but if you take the proposal of the story that is not enough to be an anime error. anime horror, suspense, drama, romance and the like always ask a good soundtrack to compose his narrative and Konasuba not apply to any of these cases.\\n\\n\r\nThe only flaw of the anime is that it seems like it walks, walks, walks ... but it never leaves the place. Yes they have many adventures that vary during the course of the work, but we never really see an evolution. You can ask \"but you just said that he does not keep repeating the same jokes\", yes I actually said that, but in this case I am only taking into account THE COMEDY of the anime, here I am considering the plot with a whole and it is in this point where just the anime fails! The story advances, advances, advances ... but when we see it is back in the same place. This season is not a problem but the following season affects the performance of the anime a lot.",

I will give props to the show on it's aesthetics, but comparing the look to the actual content is pretty unfair the way I see it. I say this because honestly, nothing really major happens in the show and each episode feels more like it's own stand alone thing than a chronological series of events. \r\nNothing issue I had with the anime wasthe jokes that was kinda it's main selling point. Not saying the jokes were bad, but they did start to get repetitive after sometime making it obvious where the plot of any particular episode was going. This happens because the characters are basically one trick ponies when it comes to personality where at some points I actually forgot their names and actually knew them as \"Protagonist\", \"Useless Goddess\", \"explosive Witch\", and \"Masochistic Knight\". \\n\\n\r\nI feel like the show does a good job with their comedy, which I won't say is a bad thing, but it kinda just introduces you to a character, shows you their quirks, and have you laugh at them without anything new being added to the character. Sure there may be a conflict or two they face, but by the end of the episode it's almost like it never existed and come next episode it's almost like it completely forgotten that it ever happened. \\n\\n\r\nI can't really fault the show on what it is, because I will admit it's entertaining, but it's nothing I think should be praised as a masterpiece for what it is.

            "content": "This review is based solely on first season of anime, with no knowledge about source material.\r\nAt first glance, Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!, or KonoSuba for short, looks like most generic comedy harems with \"average at everything\" protagonist... but it's much more than that. In this review I'll focus mostly on explaining why.\r\nStory:\r\nRandom-nobody boy ends up in different world for whatever reason. Nothing special, right? But what if the reason he got transported to this other world was already funnier than most comedy anime out there?\r\nLet's be honest. KonoSuba is comedy, not epic story about heroes and their struggles. Its world is very basic\"RPG like world with demon king and adventurers\", which, while seemingly boring and overused, goes perfectly with lighthearted atmosphere of the story. That lightheartedness is the strongest point of the story - even when things seemed to get serious, this anime managed to make me laugh.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:\\n\r\nWhile colours, lines, and effects are nice, they aren't anything exceptional. Same goes for music. What makes up for them are perfectly fitting voice acting and characters expressions - especially ones going with all kinds of disgust, pity and such. Kazuma's glances alone made me laugh many times, even before he said what he thought.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nNow, this is where KonoSuba excels. Every character is unique and awesome. They all have their quirks and can be funny and annoying at the same time. \\n\r\nYou won't see tsundere childhood friend or cute imouto (not that I'd mind...) here. \\n\r\nWhat you get instead is dumb as hell goddess who is so full of herself you want to kill her but at the same time cute enough that you can't really hate her, or maniacal mage girl who lives for sole burposes of blowing things up. And what about extreme M blonde who can't actually do anything else than taking hits?\\n\r\nAnd then there is Kazuma himself. If you expect another dense harem MC, then go other way. This one, while being standard shut-in highschooler, is far from usual dense protagonist. He understands his situation, knows what he wants and doesn't hesitate to use tricks to move forward. Can be nice, but also mean and sarcastic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe facts that I rewatched KonoSuba mere 3 monhts after watching it for the first time speaks for itself. While short and not too deep, this anime manages to keep one interested all the time, and you don't even notice when you clicked to watch next episode.",

            "content": "SPOILER FREE REVIEW\r\nThis review covers the 22 episodes of Konosuba (2 seasons and 2 OVAS) since both seasons are in every aspect identical (though the drop in the animation quality seems pretty notable to me in the second season).\r\nKonosuba is for a lot of people a very hard anime to review simply because there is no secret formula to review comedy series and because not everybody in the planet shares the same sense of humor but i'm not one of those guys, Konosuba is not as innocent as it seems ergo it should be ready to receive harder hits due to it's own nature, thesynopsis and the genre labels are not wrong but they are not complete either, what the synopsis and the genre labels forget to mention is that the fanservice amount in this series is HUGE and that part is extremely important.\\n\\n\r\nKonosuba is another one of those animes that belong to the INSANELY famous/infamous \"Isekai\"sub-genre and to my eyes Konosuba brings absolutely nothing new to the table, i have to mention i'm not a well versed person in this sub-genre at all and even i can tell this show is nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nRecently i've seen fans of this show saying Konosuba is a better choice than other Isekai animes because it explores a \"whole new perspective\" that hasn't been touched ever, hell, i've even read several comments of people that to go as far as saying this anime is a deconstruction, they say the idea of a show where the protagonist travels to a whole new world and he actually choses to stay and struggle instead of trying desperately to find his way out is as revolutionary as Utena, but sadly this is false, the same idea was explored in No Game No Life and the concept was touched superficially in nothing more and nothing less than SAO so i don't know exactly where such idea came from.\\n\\n\r\nTo keep this review short ill say this show uses the exact same formula over and over and over again, the jokes are basically always the same, since they grow from the same roots it would be dumb to expect otherwise, these roots are the unidimensional characters, we have the dumb and almost useless goddess who always ruins everything, the EXTREMELY pervert and masochist paladin, the nini-hikikomori protagonist (who is also insanely pervert) and the crazy girl with a cronic addiction to sniffing C4 that also enjoys giving weird names to everything she founds, what the hell? Chunchunmaru and Chomosuke? lol\\n\\n\r\nMoving out to the technical section, well... i try not to be superficial and to not judge a book by it's cover but the music is forgettable, the character desing is generic and simplistic for at least all of the secondary characters and the animation is TERRIBLE but since the animation part seems to be on purpouse i'll leave to you to be the judge and deliberate if that is good or bad. Does that animation and character desing improve the comical aspect of the series? it's up to you and only you pal.\\n\\n\r\nThe real and honest reason a lot people actually started watching Konosuba is nothing more and nothing less that... oh yeah buddy you know that, say it with me, don't be shy \u00a1\u00a1\u00a1THE DELICIOUS NUTRUTIOUS FANSERVICE!!! \u00a1\u00a1\u00a1YEAH BOIIIII!!! back in 2016 anime forums and Facebook groups were filled to the top with pictures of Aqua going commando and GIFS of this anime and his... particular jiggle physics, well Konosuba is not the only sinner who caught adepts by using this metod, another insanely popular anime this year did exactly the same thing, getting massive for having a very \"complex plot\", i'm talking to you Mr. Kobayashi, the point here is that showing some skin really helps to become massive (lol) and that point is one of the main reasons i judge this anime much more seriously, well we also have the fact that some villians are supossed to be though guys but end up being pathethic cartoons and that the world is insanely small, everything spins around the main 4 since nobody outside of them achives nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nWatch this anime if you like: NGNL, SAO, Overlord, Mondaiji tachi, etc.\\n\\n\r\nDon't watch this if you look for alternative experiences when it comes to animation, you are gonna get dissapointed.\\n\\n",

Kazuma (protagonist) die, meet Aqua, reborn with Aqua to the new world he never see before. But hey, they give the story so much comedic scene, with a giant toad, cabbage, and dullahan. I'm always think \"isekai\" anime was so serious with many action and much drama, but hey this anime was so fresh with that comedy and Kazuma's words.\r\nArt (6/10)\r\nThe art ... not good, but not bad too.Inconsistent and so far inferior than many new anime, but it become a trade mark, with much variety expression\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nI love the sound. BGM, OP, ED. Not perfect, but so fit with this anime. Especially with that ED song, i love it so much and think it as \"one of the greatest ending song for anime ever\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nYou have Kazuma, a lucky bastard with many cute girls in his party, the guy with weakest job (adventurer) in party but have many useful skill to mocking your enemy or your party mate. Aqua, the selfish goddess, with almighty job as Arch Priest, but choose a party skill to entertain other people. Megumin, the chuuni girl with Arch Wizard's job, can have many magic arsenal but choose to stay to the only one, the destructive magic, Explosion. Darkness, the masochist tanker, fit with her job as crusader with a strong defence, unfortunately, she can't hit opponent. The misfit party that sounds so fun, what make this anime so enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nI can't stop laugh to watch this anime. I repeat it like 100 times and it still so fun to watch. I think no anime this year can repeat this performance (just my opinion). Watch it with more people and laugh it off your room.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nDespite the art, this anime was so great. It was simple but so fun to watch. I can't wait to watch the 2nd season next year. I hope it become more fun and the art will be good.",

            "content": "Had to give this series a go considering how many people recommended it to me and because it was pretty big in 2016. Well, it didn't quite hit the spot for me. \r\nThe first episode was funny because it subverted expectations. It started out strong and promising but became more and more boring as it progressed. Most of the segments and jokes weren't funny, or maybe my intelligence is low and I don't get the humor. I laughed maybe 4-5 times during the whole show and I guess it's better than nothing. The rest was just forced comedy and same old jokes over and overagain. But it's definitely more funny than Nichijou and that's something. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is really good in some segments, especially during Megumin's explosions. The OP is also very well animated. Backgrounds look beautiful and the character designs are solid. Megumin's design is definitely the best. But they used CGI for Destroyer (and maybe some other things which I can't remember) and CGI is always a no-no in my book.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is not bad but nothing particular caught my ear and there was no melody which got stuck in my head. The OP and ED were generic and uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\nStory is non-existent and there's no character development but considering the nature of this anime that's not a huge disadvantage. I understand that it parodies RPG and MMO elements but they could've come up with a better story while doing so. This anime just doesn't go anywhere. \\n\\n\r\nKonosuba had potential and, in my opinion, needed a lot more work. This is not a terrible anime per se. It has some good bits but loses it's fire pretty quickly. They should've just called it \"Goofing Off In This Wonderful World\".",

Other aspects are pushed aside for the comedy so don't expect much there. \\n\\n\r\nIf you find the show hilarious you will most likely be giving it a 9 or 8 out of 10 if not most likely a 5 or 6 its just that type of show . \\n\\n\r\nKonosuba can be hit or miss but if its a hit then it can be a comedic masterpiece.   \\n\\n\r\nWatch if your sense of humour allows.",

            "content": "KonoSuba is a full-blown fantasy comedy, that parodies RPGs and the \"Isekai\" genre that Sword Art Online popularized. It's pretty much purely non-serious, doesn't have much of an overall story (there is one, but it never goes anywhere) and most episodes are rather self-contained. But what it lacks in epic adventures, it more than enough makes it up with its great humor.\r\nThe main reason for that is its cast of likeable, quirky characters. They're not the most sympathetic bunch, the male main character is selfish, rude and quite perverted. His main companion is not much better, mainly distinguished by a more positive disposition. An over-specialized,to the point of near uselessness, mage and a fighter, that is incapable of hitting anything but is way too enthusiastic in her role as a tank, top off the adventurer party that could barely be any more ineffective. Most of the humor comes from their internal conflict and lack of ability that makes it tricky to fulfill quests. And even when they manage to succeed, despite themselves, they're not always better off afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors have a done particularly great job in bringing the characters to life. Particularly the voices of the four main characters are near-perfect and really embody them very well to the point it's hard to imagine them with any other ones. The music is done well too, although teh ending song, beautiful as it is, does not fit the series very well.\\n\\n\r\nBeing DEEN work, the visuals have quite a share of hiccups, but its not immediately noticeable and overall it looks really good. Some things are particularly well-done and a real pleasure to look at, like Megumin's ever-beloved explosion spell (especially good, since its lengthy and you'll see it relatively often).\\n\\n\r\nSomething that's not apparent at first is that KonoSuba is quite a bit raunchy. It's normally not too much, but there are several noticeable instances of fanservice (particularly bouncing breasts) and lewd humor, which might already turn off some people. One episode goes way, way farther, though, to the point of turning into an ecchi. People who dislike such anime are highly unlikely to enjoy that episode (of course, those who like such things will have probably even more fun with it).\\n\\n\r\nIt's not an understatement to say that KonoSuba is one of the best comedy anime I've ever seen. While it arguably doesn't do anything special, it does it extremely well. It doesn't take itself or anything serious and doesn't hold back when it sees an opportunity for a joke. The setup and parodistic elements make it particularly interesting for fans of MMORPGs, but it's humor is broad enough to be also interesting for anyone else.",

Isekai's are a well that has run dry and the industry thinks there still something actually good worth reaching. This is a breath of fresh air in the sub-genre and a damn good parody of the tropes and genres at that. I really like referring to this show as the \"it's always sunny in Philadelphia\" of anime cause its true. All of our main characters are not the greatest of people and are all assholes in their own ways. But they're all so lovable and funny that we can look pastit and laugh at their misfortune.",

            "content": "Konosuba is my most favorite anime of all time,  I've held off the review just never being able to find the words to show my appreciation.   However,  having watched the English dub released recently,  I have found a different set of words.   The dub sucks, why are dubs sucking?  I am thankful that more people are going to get to see the show,  but I also know its going to ruin the experience for them!  Ifyou watch Konosuba in the dub format and hate it; you get a free pass on taste this go round. BECAUSE:\\n\\n\\n\r\n            Konosuba is a brilliant parody of the most cliche Isekai you could imagine.  The protagonist is reincarnated in a fantasy world fighting monsters and demons with his useless goddess sidekick, and a whole cast of characters whose affinity for failure (or unexpected success) will have you rolling in laughter.  It truly is the journey with this fable,  as the destination is at times seemingly irrelevant, given the cast can struggle with just everyday life.   There's a lot of 1 step forward 2 steps back type situations,  and they are all written with an unmatched comedic genius.  When you finally reach the end of Konosuba season 1,  You only want more!!   ((unless its the dub,  then you want just want to forget))  \\n\\n\r\n               The animation in Konosuba is like a dependable can of Campbell's soup.  It's not gonna blow your mind, but will be comfortable and familiar in quality.  The audio is crucial to Konosuba,  not only the dynamic sounds of the environment and action, but even the musical scores are just down right comforting as well as complimenting.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were really sold by their Japanese voice actors.  The personality obtained from their acting created the image and archetype of those characters. Their performance sent the character list of Konosuba straight into my memory as individuals.  I have heavy beef with the English dub.   I am sure they are talented voice actors,  but the translation of those characters is total bust, and here is why\\n\\n\\n\r\nKazuma:  Japanese:  Coy, sly,  Voice of Reason, Optimistic but realistic.\\n\r\n                 English:  Twerpy Derpy Doofus\\n\\n\r\nAqua Japanese:  Prissy, cocky, self absorbed, fragile, annoying to protoag \\n\r\n           Englsih:      Frantically Annoying to Everyone.\\n\\n\r\nMegumin Japanese:    Coy,  Schemy,  Overconfident,  comical, blunt\\n\r\n               English:     1/4 the self confidence, shaky,  not very humorous.\\n\\n\r\nDarkness Japanese:  Almost a split personality between virtuous and pervy,\\n\r\n       English:  They got darkness right, but  shes to loud at the wrong times.\\n\\n\\n\r\n                 It's truly a difference of loving the show, and being annoyed by it.  I  fell in love with Konosuba the first time I viewed it,  yet I wish I could undo having watched the English dub. \\n\\n\r\n            The Griiiizzzzzzliiiiessst Ziff of Kingsbeard gives the raw & sub format a personally biased 10/10\\n\r\n (( when it probably measures a proper 9 over the  visuals))\\n\\n\r\n            The ginger beardicus of anime viewership is also going leave a WELL DESERVED 3 for the dub format.   The audio of the characters  sold to me by the dub were not lovable. I did not enjoy it and while the story would still have been a great concept; Konosuba would have failed to impact me even as a parody.  It would be like someone who annoys you having a great idea. Despite the excellence of the idea, the caliber of the person telling you will have an effect on your opinion.  \\n\\n\r\n         I still recommend watching it,  but you know.  In the raw or subbed format.  HIGHLY recommend.   THANKS FOR READING!",

            "content": "Konosuba is a very well praised anime. It is a hilarious anime (came in second for Best Comedy in the CrunchyRoll Anime Awards) that pokes fun at the \"trapped in a video game world\" anime genre. The highlight if the show are the 4 main characters, Kazuma, Aqua, Megumin and Darkness. \r\nPlot (No Spoilers)\r\nKazuma is a shut-in teenage boy who only leaves the house to go to school and buy video games. But, one day Kazuma sees a girl about to get hit by what he thinks is a truck. I won't talk anymore about how he dies, because it is absolutely hilarious and Idon't wanna ruin it for people. After he dies he is sent to the Afterlife and greeted by the goddess Aqua. Aqua is extremely rude to Kazuma, making fun of how he died and how he lived his life before his death. She says that she will send Kazuma to a RPG like world and gift him with one amazing weapon or skill of his choosing. Kazuma, being completely sick of Aqua's attitude, decides that he wants to take her with him to this world. Against Aqua's will, she and Kazuma are sent to the RPG world, with the mission of killing the Demon King. Along the way they might the crimson demon arch mage, Megumin and the crusader, Darkness.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Analysis\\n\\n\r\nI'm gonna start off with the \"goddess\" Aqua. Aqua is a selfish narcissistic jerk, who is obsessed with party tricks and money. She is probably my least favorite character, but I still really like her. The anime knows how unlikable she is and uses that to make her the butt of most of the jokes. When she starts to get too full of herself the anime loves to put her in her place, whether its by getting completely shown up or by getting her butt whopped by a monster. She does have a few moments where she is likable.\\n\\n\r\nNext is Megumin. Megumin is a young crimson demon who is an arch mage. Though there's only one problem with that. She only uses explosion magic. Which won't be a problem if it wasn't for the fact that using one explosion spell completely wears her out for the rest of the day. She can't move at all after using it. She refuses to learn any other type of magic, because explosion magic is the best and is her favorite. The scenes of Megumin using her explosion magic are always great. The animation for her charging her power and her dialogue while charging is almost always funny. And after a descrutive attack like that, seeing Megumin collapse to the ground is just really funny. She is completely over the top and I completely love it.\\n\\n\r\nDarkness is probably my favorite out of the bunch. Mainly because she's the only kindhearted member of the party. Darkness is a crusader meaning she has high HP and Stamina. But there is one problem. She has awful accuracy! She can't even hit a stationary opponent! But Darkness is completely fine with that. Considering the fact that she is a masochist. She will run face first into danger, hoping she will get a beating. Even rude remarks makes her tremble. Though she is a kind person and a good knight that will always fight for others. \\n\\n\r\nIf you couldn't tell, all three of these girls are completely insane for the most part. Constantly putting themselves and the whole party in danger due to their personalities. \\n\\n\r\nAnd poor Kazuma is stuck with them. Being stuck with these three turns Kazuma into a bigger jerk than Aqua. But Kazuma's attitude isn't all maloci. It's mostly just spite for the ggirls doing something to annoy him. He almost completely hates all three of them, though he does care for them somewhat. Kazuma is more move a thief like character. Though he can use weak magic as well as one undead skill. His main skill is \"Steal\" which lets him take one item from his target, though most of the time it's their underwear. Kazuma is a jerk because all of his hopes and dreams in this fantasy world are completely crushed almost as soon as he gets there.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is completely beautiful! Just about every single character, including side characters, have one color that always associates with them. Kazuma is Green, Aqua is Blue, Megumin is Red and Darkness is Yellow. The world that they are in is also beautiful as well. And the few fights we get are as good looking as they are funny, which is a lot! Though I do have some issues with the annoying fan service the show constantly has. Heck there's basically a whole episode dedicated to fan service and nothing more than that. The fan service is basically in every single episode, oh and apparently there are no bras in this fantasy world either. While I don't mind the perverted jokes the show makes all the time, the fan service is just a bother. Besides those complaints, the art is great!\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely love the voice acting in this show. Even though I don't speak Japanese I still have got to hand it down to these voice actors, they completely nailed these roles. Giving the perfect delivery for every single joke this show has. Though I did find the soundtrack to get a little old since it was just same old tracks used over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are nice as well. Nothing really to rave about though. My favorite of the two is the energetic OP, while the ED is more of a Folk Song. \\n\\n\r\nComplainants \\n\\n\r\nBesides the fan service I only have a few complainants. \\n\\n\r\nThe first being the lack of character development for Darkness, and Megumin to a lesser extent. We just don't get to know very much about them after our initial introduction to them. I would like to know more about their past. Megumin does get slight character development, but hardly enough. And Darkness doesn't get any till the last episode. Though it does seem that they are continuing to give Darkness more development in Season 2, I hope they do the same for Megumin.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other complaint is how the groups main quest to kill ht e Demon King is but to a hault by so many different things. The show doesn't really have a story except for a few episodes where some plot does happen.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely loved Konosuba! It was complete blast through out the whole thing. Despite a few issues I had, I found myself laughing through every episode (except the fan service episode). If you haven't watched Konosuba yet, now is the perfect time! Since Season 2 just recently started. There are only 10 episodes in Season 1 so it won't take you long to catch up. I give Konosuba an 8/10",

If you're expecting loads of action, a serious plot, or over the top spells and attacks this is the wrong anime. Now back to Kono Subarashii the story starts off with a otaku with no life, all he lived for was games. After some events he gets the chance to live in a parallel earth filled with magic like a rpg game.\r\nPositives: Loaded with jokes and adult sexual themes, solid characters that come to life after a couple episodes, and ashow that just makes you want more and more.\\n\\n\r\nNegatives: Lack of action, slow plot filled with adventures, and no real display of skills learned. We don't see any real progression.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this show.",

From the first we're already served with bad art but as the show goes on, this anime turned into one of the most entertaining anime in winter season 2016.\r\nKono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo story is pretty much following the trend with a MC is being trapped in fantasy world. The MC, Kazuma thinks that he can be a hero and defeat the dark lords in that world like anyanime and game that he ever played but reality smash him hard. With such useless companions and no talents, Kazuma must struggling his life in the Fantasy world.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the premise that i said above maybe sound so stupid but its pretty much tells what this anime about. If you're looking for action and intense fight like any adventure action anime would be then this anime is not what you're looking for. Like premise said, Konosuba is mainly focus on the struggling Kazuma to live in fantasy world. You wouldnt find any fight scenes in this anime but you will find so many funny tsukkomi jokes. The jokes is really spot on and easily to understand, i really laugh my ass of when i watch this anime. The jokes in konosuba is mainly what makes this anime so great.\\n\\n\r\nNot only the jokes, what makes the jokes is funnier is the seiyuu. They are perfectly fit with every characters's trait in this anime like Aqua with his stupid and airhead personality are voiced by Sora Amamiya, she is really nailed Aqua's voice. and also, Kazuma who voiced by Jun Fukushima is really great to be the tsukkomi for every jokes that appears in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnother things to be worth to be mention is the characters, they are so original. like did you ever imagine Defender or tanker which have M personality? Yes, Konosuba have that, her name is Darkness. Your rotten type girl who is always get horny by getting attacked. I mean, thats perfect combination, right? tanker with M personality. Thats purely amazing. Not only Tanker, did u ever imagine Great mage that can only cast one destruction magic per day? yes, her name is Megumin. or maybe skillful priest but have airhead personality and pretty much idiot? thats just so brilliant. Every characters in this anime have their own uniqueness and make them as a valuable characters not only as side characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere is not much complain for every aspects in this anime except the art parts. The characters design looks so sloopy and sometimes makes such a weird pose and anatomy. The background is so-so but there is time like when they put an effort in the art especially when it comes to magic circle. It looks detailed and great. Anyway the lackness in art section maybe makes this anime not perfect but somehow for me, this lackness is really suitable with this kind of anime.\\n\\n\r\nLast, i dont know how to say this about this anime. If i can describe this anime in one sentence it would be \"stupidly funny\". In every episode, i always laughed so hard. There is not much anime that makes me laugh so hard like this anime. So yeah, i would definitely recommend this anime if you're into comedy anime. Looking forward to the second season thou!",

            "content": "Note: This review may contain spoilers!\r\nStory: 7/10 - The story and scenery of the anime reminds me of Runescape. It makes me think they are either in Lumbridge or Tutorial Island. They get to take on really cool quests and receive rewards that can help them survive. There's not a lot of plot development (yet), but I have a feeling that there is more to come in the future.\r\nCharacters: 7/10 - I always feel bad for Kazuma, especially when he has to deal with Aqua x). Aqua can be annoying but powerful, (DARKNESS) aka Raratina can be pervy but she's brave & Megumin is socute, powerful but needs to work on her endurance after using her powers. But as a team, they can unstoppable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 - There's a lot funny moments in the anime. (I.e.: Their teamwork on quests). This anime also reminds me of Hai To Gensou No Grimgar. While Konosuba is very funny during their quests, Hai To Gensou No Grimgar has more plot development and explores the backstories of some of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 - I definitely recommend it! It is definitely one of the animes that you MUST WATCH! It's filled comedic moments and senses of frustration at times that makes you want to cringe. In Konosuba, you get to know the characters and overtime, you get to see the dynamic when they work as a team while battling monsters and villains. You won't regret it. Plus, I can't wait for season 2.",

            "content": "With more than 8/10 on MAL, needless to say I got into Kono Suba with high expectations and while I understand why it's rated so high, I can't deny that it was kind of a let down.\r\nOne thing I'll have to concede to the show is that it doesn't waste time with any stretched out premises, it gets right to the point really fast and immediately sets the tone. Indeed, you won't need much time to figure that this show doesn't take itself seriously and has little to no restraint with the comedy it offers. And that's the main force of this anime, the comedyis always extremely exagerrated but never feels stretched or forced. Fast premise, cut to the chase and jump right into the action, good comedy, Kono Suba sets off with an extremely good start ! \\n\\n\r\nBut that's it... You start the show with a very good impression but after a few episodes you realise that it's never taking off. The comedy stays good, the interactions between characters keep sailing at a steady pace, but...that's it. The story barely progresses, the characters don't gain any depth, what was supposed to be a fast premise turns out to be a rushed one since we never get to know more about the MC or the other characters but...he's a dude. In the last episodes, there's somewhat of a background that's taking shape with Darkness but it stays very surface level and sadly very generic. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, I can't help but feel that the show fails at clearly introducing itself as a show that's mostly focused on comedy. I think it would have gained from clearly setting itself as an episodic show, that would have prevented the viewer from expecting any major progress in the story or the character development.\\n\r\nI'll finish on a good note by saying that the art, animation and music are all top notch even though i'll regret the forced booby fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Kono Suba stays a pretty enjoyable experience as long as you clearly understand what you're getting into : a show that doesn't take itself seriously no less, but no more. \\n\\n",

You've just gotta love these clueless idiots. They take all the typical Isekai tropes and flip them on their heads. The MC, Kazuma, instead of being an overpowered cool guy, is an expectant jerk who thinks things will always go his way and is a bit of a perv. He then meets Aqua, who you'd expect to be the majestic love interest, is an entitled, whiny, stupid little idiot who party's and drinks allthe time, then begs her party members for money. Megumin is the cute little sister archetype, but along with that is a childish brat. The last of the MC's is Darkness, who appears to be the calm-and-collected, self-sacrificial, older sister type. But why would someone in a world as cruel as Konosuba be so willing to risk her life for others? Well, as it turns out, those 'selfless acts of heroism' are driven by very selfish masochism. In fact, she often risks her life and the lives of her party members just to satisfy her masochism.\\n\\n\r\nJust reading this part of the jerk, the brat, the meme wizard, and the weirdo, you'd think you'd hate all tease characters, right? Well, the show somehow does the complete opposite. You've just gotta love these wonderful idiots. Especially the #BestWorstGirls\\n",

            "content": "KonoSuba is an anime that I entered with mixed expectations. What I got kind of shocked me, and for the better. I'm not sure if this counts as plagiarism or not, but I am going to copy the format of the other guy that gave this anime a low score since I kind of like it. I won't copy the guy word by word, but simply the font style and ratings that they used. All words used in this font are mine and mine alone.\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nWRITING: 5/10\r\nI do admit that the writing for this anime is rather lackluster at times, but honestly, I admire a lotat  how much it fought generic anime clich\u00e9 unlike anything I've ever watched before, such as one of the most generic tropes of a character always saying the other character's name. Whenever his name was spoken, Kazuma would go \"Yes?\" or acknowledge it every, single, time. And I thought that was hilarious for some reason. Speaking of, I admire his quirks throughout. He has small commentary during the female rant sequences that make them very enjoyable and his very essence brought so much life to most of the scenes. Very rare for a character to do that.\\n\\n\r\nThough, sadly, this is where the positives end. One thing I did not like was that, near the end, it started to slowly migrate over to the generic \"male character gets boned\" shtick where Kazuma inevitably suffered the most out of any of his other allies. I think this correlates with how Japan sees women to men, so the male characters normally get screwed all of the time. And I don't mean sex. Kazuma really suffered a lot near the end, but I admire his charisma in that he didn't really become a sad sack and was also not afraid to speak up for himself. However, as good as his charisma was, he was not able to fight all of the clich\u00e9, but he did tackle the more annoying ones.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nARTWORK: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is quite gorgeous, but maybe that's also because I am not used to the people that animated this. The way the mouths look during the comedy scenes, the eye design and more feel unfamiliar to me, as though I genuinely haven't seen such a style before. And this certainly applies to more than just design, cause eye-catches come quite a bit as well. I loved how they did certain comedy scenes as well and, overall, the style is simple, yet gentle. It's a nice flow that fits the (mostly) lighthearted nature of the whole thing.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI have such a moderate score here cause, well most anime normally have memorable OSTs to me, this one kind of fell flat. I really loved the ending song and how well it conveyed the calm situation of the town, with everyone walking around, some of the allies trying to do basic tasks and some of them being appreciated by the townspeople. It just brought forth a very pleasant atmosphere that I really liked and I could really see myself coming back to it. Not just to listen, however, but to also watch. Cause, well the song is peaceful, I feel listening to it without watching doesn't bring forth that same experience. And I find that kind of sad, but also nice at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, however, the soundtrack you hear in the anime itself is rather bland. With the exception of a certain sad piano song that plays during the more serious scenes, which I thought sounded very lovely, most of it sounds pretty generic. Perhaps, the opera theme that plays almost exclusively for Megumin is pretty comical since it can take the comedy and shift it into a state of seriousness at the most bizarre of times, but I sadly can't see myself remembering it. If I can find it at all, I'd probably want to add the piano song to my anime song playlist. But, everything else is pretty forgettable and, despite finishing today, I've already forgotten most of it.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nCHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis score is honestly so high cause, again, Kazuma. He alone gives this score a really high rating cause, really, he just fought all of that clich\u00e9 as I said earlier. there's not much more to be said about how funny he is.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the main female ally of his was quite obnoxious. I didn't mind her personality so much, since I thought it was hilarious how she would slide from cocky to pitiful. I simply disliked how, despite her being the one to blame for a good amount of the damage caused to the town at times, Kazuma was still the one responsible for paying for it. She did have her own debts at first early on, but eventually, Kazuma became the scapegoat and that bugged me. And, honestly, some of the other allies felt a bit bland and had one-sided personalities, although I've taken quite a liking to Megumin due to her exotic nature. Definitely the highlight of the females.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime will make you laugh and that's just about all it is trying to do. The animation is peaceful and fits the atmosphere, the soundtrack can be pretty good at times (I actually do like the theme that plays before a quest starts cause it sounds so epic and like you are in an actual video game) and I will, unarguably, say that it is miles better than Sword Art Online, which had very peculiar pacing and a lot more that, well, would take up tons of paragraphs in that certain review to go over.\\n\\n\r\nBut, KonoSuba is not something I would recommend to just anyone. One thing I never mentioned is that it gets rather sexual near the end, even having what I would almost call a scene ripped right from a hentai in one of them, but you can just watch that for yourself to judge. The sexual nature doesn't take away from it, but it is rather peculiar that it is not listed under \"ecchi\" at all, despite the aforementioned episode I brought up. And I feel I had to mention it since, again, it is not listed under that genre for whatever reason, so you deserve a proper warning before you dive in. It also has moderate sexual humor all around, but the central story will still be intact and it's not too bad to watch.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you really don't like that kind of stuff, I would go so far as to say you shouldn't be watching KonoSuba at all, cause it has quite a bit of that stuff in there later down the road, despite how innocently it starts off. If you have a high tolerance for it, or even enjoy it, then by all means watch this and you will not regret it.",

            "content": "I gotta start this review by saying I love memes. There's a lot that can be done with absurdist referential humor that strikes me as incredibly clever or inspired. When I say something has memes, or is a meme, know that it's not an insult, it comes from a place of appreciation. \r\nKonosuba is a show with incredible meme potential, which is how I was first introduced to it. A lot about the show's set up is really clever and subversive, to the extent that it would be silly to try to list everything. It starts off blowing back expectations when the protagonist dies apathetic death and is made fun of by a goddess, and everything spirals out from there. \\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the aspect of the show I would praise the most. There are also a good number of clever moment-to-moment jokes that had me chuckling. However, the show didn't really have much for me beyond that. My favorite comedy series, stuff like D-Frag! and Cromartie High School, have similarly clever set-ups, a lot of hilarious situations, but also more wordplay and understated humor, arguably more developed characters, and most importantly are more consistently surprising. Konosuba's characters all have an obvious \"thing\" to them, a core element to their personality, and I didn't really see much past that. Despite the narrative subversions, this lent a certain element of predictability to how some of the comedy played out that definitely diminished the appeal for me. There are certainly charming and funny moments, but there were also some that I found somewhat dull, and as the show went on I was surprised less and less often.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of this is subjective, of course; comedy is perhaps more than most other genres. But I didn't like Konosuba as much as I was hoping to, based on the premise; it was reasonably enjoyable but in my view rarely inspired beyond the initial set up. 6/10.",

Everything In Konosuba revolved around into trying to turn everything into comedy. And the problem with this is it just killed any sort of drama or action in the story. Which was very unusual because you can tell that the writer was trying to make these dramatic scenes But then instead of making them dramatic they just turned a big scary enemy attacking the city, into a joke that you couldn't even take seriously. All the main characters in thisseries had very exaggerated personalities. To be honest it feels like the writer turned each main character into a running gag based on their abilities. (for example Megumin is the girl who loves explosions but can only cast one giant spell each day). It's still an enjoyable series to watch, but the only really enjoyable aspect of this anime was the comedy.",

But the trophy goes to the ED song, where the MC companions sing together a rather beatiful and chilling song, I lost the count of how many times I went to the youtube to hear it, this coming from a guy thatnever care much about the soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- MC hates cliches and won't hesitate in kicking a woman, his companions are crazy powerful women making him the weakest in raw strength ( again, not cliche ). \\n\r\n                   The other 3 companions are  stupid, crazy or Sadomasochistic and will make his life hard despite his great luck.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Really, I already watched this anime 5 times, and read the light novel twice, there is like 15 light novels to read. it's really funny, and you end up loving the character despite their flaws. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I can finally say that i did watched this show so i can properly trash on it like crazy without holding back. To be completely honest? I expected for this show to be average so i could go with \"meh, its a fine show\".\r\nThe world and the story: The world of Konosuba is pretty interesting for being a \"gaming\" world, it doesnt do anything new (i don't think you have to flip the table like crazy and create something drastically unique to have a quality product) and while the start is incredibly cliche (despite the show trying to poke fun at cliches) it picks upfast towards trying to show off something original.\\n\r\nWhy are some medics laughing when someone is dying though?\\n\\n\r\nArt: It's fine but there is a TON of fanservice. I wouldnt complain if there wasnt so much or if the fanservice was slightly necesary but that's not the case. The fanservice is not necesary 90% of the time.\\n\\n\r\nThe op and ending are so forgetable and i'm saying this just after finishing an episode. A bunch of VA didnt seemed to fit the character at all like Aqua.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Kazuma was surprisingly entertaining most of the time but his comedy sometimes relied into poking fun at cliches and tropes. I like parody but in order to make a good parody you have to make something funny, something with quality or something entertaining enough to turn your head back and have some harmless laughter at whatever is being made fun of. \\n\r\nKonosuba tries incredibly hard to be a parody but the show in itself is so incredibly boring that this backfires greatly. It's like a terrible soccer player taunting professional players and not being able to even make some proper passes.\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is boring and plain (Darkness being the only exception). Making one dimensional characters is not a bad thing, they have the ability to get character development, they can be funny if handled properly and they can make for amazing moments. Konosuba doesnt do any of this. The characters simply are there and after their initial impression they wont move too much or show off any redeemable qualities.\\n\r\nAlso there is something wrong when your one dimensional characters try to make fun about a new one dimensional character that is being presented. You can deduce that yourself.\\n\r\nAgain the show tries really hard to convince you that this band of people are unprepared and pathetic when they are not. They are not weak, they are crazy powerful and incredibly talented (that's also another cliche/trope...).\\n\\n\r\nAs for the fun you will have seeing the show. The selling point and argument of all the fans of the show i talked with was \"I know it looks stupid but its really funny\" \"It's  good comedy\" or something along those lines.\\n\r\nOn the second episode the MC was waving around the underwears of a girl like a flag. \\n\r\nThat was so funny! (sarcasm).\\n\r\nThe jokes in Konosuba aren't long or properly constructed. The level of comedy is almost at Pop Team Epic level of terribleness (but not crazyness) but PTE is aware of this.\\n\r\nKonosuba is not, a bunch of jokes are thrown here and there but aside from chuckling a little at the second episode there wasnt a moment of the show that was remotely funny.\\n\r\nMy internal fan tried really hard to overlook the flaws my critical side was throwing at this show, desperately trying to grasp or grab something in the show that was worthwhile. \\n\r\nSomething that deserved praised, something entertaining, something DECENT.\\n\r\nThere was nothing.",

            "content": "Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo, also known as KonoSuba for short, probably ended up to be a big surprise for many. By judging the key visual, one might expect a generic trapped-in-a-videogame type anime, however it is anything but. An anime about a group of misfits who can\u2019t decide what their true goal is couldn\u2019t be more entertaining! It\u2019s funny, wacky, and even lewd at times. This anime is for both people who love trapped-in-a-videogame type anime, and those who hate is too because it parodies those genres. \r\n~{Story}~\r\nThe premise is pretty similar to most anime of the same type; the main character choosesto go to an MMO-type game world and tries to beat that game with a group of companions. However, KonoSuba breaks away from those clich\u00e9s pretty quickly. What first started as a party working together to try to beat the game, quickly turned out to be a party that\u2019s too lazy to do such tasks and is better off doing the simple work. KonoSuba knows very well that you can\u2019t take its plot seriously, so it spends more time on parodying it. And those who are familiar with MMORPGs should find some of the writing funny because it pokes fun at that genre. The anime consistently compares itself to an average anime of the same genre and shows to us how different it is for the better. The story really doesn\u2019t go anywhere, mainly because it uses a slice-of-life/episodic format. The main goal was about defeating the Demon King in order to escape this world, but the story quickly stops caring less about that, which isn\u2019t bad by any means since watching the main cast fool around is much more entertaining. \\n\r\nStory: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nKonosuba cares about its comedy more than anything, and they spend the most time on that compared to anything else. And its comedy is pretty damn good! It doesn\u2019t even need to rely on it comedic situations or humorous dialogues; as long as we see the main cast interacting with each other, it\u2019s entertaining enough. Konosuba is a slice-of-life, even if it\u2019s not mentioned as one. The anime is about a group of misfits that \u201cwork together\u201d to \u201csolve problems\u201d. The first two episodes aren\u2019t as funny as the rest of the anime though, so it might take a little bit of time to like it. But once the comedy gets good, it stays good. The comedy for the most part stays consistent after the third episode mark. They even parodied death flags! There are some fanservice here and there but they\u2019re not too distracting (as a matter of a fact, some of it is pretty entertaining and fun). \\n\r\nPresentation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nThe best thing about KonoSuba is its characters. Even if the anime had nothing but the main cast fooling around and interacting with each other, it\u2019ll still be very entertaining. Kazuma, who is the protagonist of the series, starts off in a clich\u00e9 way. He\u2019s an otaku who ends up dying and is given the offer to go to an alternate game world, and he agrees. But he quickly proves to a hilarious, apathetic (at times), and sometimes an *ssh*le of a protagonist. He\u2019ll take the easy way for every situation and his reactions to comedic situations are some of the best I\u2019ve seen, even good enough to be compared to Nichijou and Gintama. Aqua, a goddess who got trapped in this world with Kazuma, is a pretty funny character, although she ends up being the weaker character out of them all, mainly because she\u2019s the most normal out of the girls. Then there\u2019s Megumin, a girl who has a fetish for explosions, however she wastes all her energy in one explosion that she ends up being useless for the day. She\u2019s a hilarious character and she performs well in comedic situations. Lastly, there\u2019s Darkness, a masochist that might be very strong, but all her attacks misses. Her masochism never gets boring as it never feels repetitive. \\n\r\nCharacter: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nThe art of this series is the weakest part of KonoSuba, as for the most part it\u2019s not very appealing. The backgrounds are done well, but the architectures lack detailing. The character designs aren\u2019t also very good. The faces of characters at times looks very cruddy and messy, and though some may say that it adds to the humor, it really just feels distracting. Some background characters really look copy and pasted. Hell, even the main cast looks like that too. Aqua and Darkness\u2019s facial structure is exactly the same. If you just change their hair, they\u2019ll look like twin sisters. However, the art isn\u2019t completely terrible because it is still watchable. The costume design for the main cast is pretty good, and so it the world design too. \\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nEven though the art is almost mediocre, the animations aren\u2019t that bad. The animations are definitely better than the art. During action scenes, it\u2019s pretty well animated. Character movements are also pretty well done. Even the most unnecessary things, such as the main cast eating, is done very well. However there are points where it feels like a slideshow as some scenes aren\u2019t animated, but instead it\u2019s just a still picture, but those are just rare occasions. Also, facial expressions aren\u2019t that well animated either as the cruddy art prevents a proper fluidity in the facial animations. But hey, at least the explosions look good! Also, the use of CG at the end for the monster was decent.\\n\r\nAnimation: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe voice acting is what makes the comedy special. The cast of seiyuu do a great job in their roles, even though most of them are pretty new to the industry. Fukushima Jun does Kazuma fantastically. Even though Fukushima hasn\u2019t done much roles yet, he does an excellent job with his comic timing here. The over-the-top reactions to comedic situations was really well done. Amamiya Sora, who is a relatively new, yet highly loved seiyuu, does Aqua perfectly too. She manages to make the character look confident, whiny, and bossy whenever needed. Takahashi Rie, who is very new and inexperienced, does an outstanding job too as she manages to make Megumin look pretentious and overly confident, and pathetic and lazy at the same time. Lastly, Kayano Ai, who is probably the most experienced seiyuu of the bunch, does a spectacular job as Darkness (as expected). It sounded like she had real fun with her role, as she manages to make her sound confident and weak at the same time. She does the masochist parts very well (too well actually). There are some other well-known seiyuu that do supporting roles, such as, Eguchi Takuya and Horie Yui, and they do a fine job at what they have to do.\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe music probably isn\u2019t the best part about this anime. The OP, \u201cfantastic dreamer\u201d, is simply okay. It not as catchy as it should be. The ED, \u201cChiisana Boukensha\u201d, though isn\u2019t that great, it does create some irony as it\u2019s very peaceful sounding, but the anime is anything but. It was a smart decision to use an ED like this for and anime like this. The background music used for KonoSuba isn\u2019t anything too special. Sometimes It feel misplaced, other times, it just feels boring. For most of the time, generic fantasy music is used, which is pretty disappointing. The placement of the OP in the last episode wasn\u2019t the best idea either. \\n\r\nMusic: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nKonoSuba ended up to be a blast to watch. Even with lackluster art and music, the comedy stood out well. Relying on its characters more than anything, it manages to be enjoyable because of how well written these characters are. Starting from episode 3, I ended up laughing more than not. The humor ended up to be very consistent. Even the action scenes, particularly the action in the last episode, was enjoyable too. And I couldn\u2019t be happier than it got a second season. The comedy may be subjective, but it might click with most people. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba was one of the biggest surprises of the season for sure. The key visuals don\u2019t do justice at all. What first seemed as a clich\u00e9 anime turned out to be parodying those genres. The characters ended up being lovable and voice acting done for them was fantastic too. This is Studio Deen\u2019s best anime in a long, long time and consistency in writing shows promise in the studio\u2019s future. And the fact that there\u2019s a second season (and an OVA) made the anime look better. If you want some laughs and silliness, KonoSuba is perfect for you! Now time to wait for that second season! \\n\\n\r\n+ Fantastic characters with fantastic comic timing. \\n\r\n+ Hilariously written, with comedy being mostly consistent throughout. \\n\r\n+ The seiyuu cast, though mostly inexperienced, do a fine job in their roles\\n\r\n+ Tackles clich\u00e9s of the same genre by parodying it. \\n\r\n- Art is lackluster and cruddy at times. \\n\r\n- Background music feels generic and felt misplaced during some occasions. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.1/10",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nThat night, as I started to drift off to sleep, my brain spoke to me. You forgot to brush your teeth. Gross, dude. I got up, half-groggy, and started to make my way to the bathroom. I was unfamiliar with the room\u2019s layout, and it was dark, so I fumbled and felt for the door.\r\nOnce inside, I turned on the lights and began to brush my teeth. My eyes weren\u2019t open, and I was barely conscious. Both of which made the sound of a door opening behind me that much more nerve-racking.\r\nWhen I looked inthe mirror, I saw my father sitting on the toilet in the bathroom closet. I stared at him, dumbfounded, wondering what in the world he was doing.\\n\\n\r\nMy father only said a single word: \u201cHellooooo!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI laughed so hard, toothpaste sprayed across the counter. My father started to laugh uncontrollably, too. Our combined laughter woke up my mother and my two siblings. Upon seeing me foaming at the mouth and leaning over the sink, and John squatting on the john, they couldn\u2019t help but laugh as well. It was a happy beginning to a truly happy vacation.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t fully know what prompted my father to push open his door and say hi, but his ridiculous decision led to comedy genius. Thankfully for KonoSuba, it likewise made the right decisions.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba starts off innocently enough. Kazuma, a boy who basically keeps to himself, one day saves the life of another from an oncoming vehicle, dying in her stead. But when he finds out that the vehicle was actually a slow-moving tractor, that he really died of shock, and that he wet himself in the process, the anime begins its comedic journey.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this opening example hints at the show\u2019s parody chops, it is not until Kazuma (and Aqua) get to the parallel world that it really becomes apparent. The looming threat of the Devil King has to wait while Kazuma digs a whole for some carpentry and Aqua parties (and vomits) the night away. A horse-filled stable, rather than a comfy hotel room, becomes the home for these \u201cheroes.\u201d Monsters, quests, and money are difficulties too large for them to handle.\\n\\n\r\nThis parodic approach seeps into nearly every part of the show. When Kazuma, Aqua, Megumin, and Darkness save the city, they earn millions in the local currency but have to pay millions and then some to fix it. Abilities are often overly useless, dangerous, and perverted. The villains are not as evil as one would normally believe.\\n\\n\r\nAs parody parades, KonoSuba avoids repetition. Often times, it introduces new characters and elements without using them again directly. For example, Chris the thief arrives to give Kazuma the \u201cSteal\u201d skill which only gets used for stealing panties, some cabbages, and the dullahan Verdia\u2019s head.\\n\\n\r\nAn even better example is Kyouya. Around for a single episode, he is used to parody the \u201cchosen hero\u201d stereotype: the girls find him creepy, he loses to Kazuma, and his fabled sword gets sold for a quick buck.\\n\\n\r\nAnd even when the anime does reuse specific elements, it twists the presentation through parody. Verdia reappears because the others didn\u2019t go to fight him in the first place. Wiz, one of the \u201cevil\u201d generals, teaches Kazuma how to use \u201cDrain Touch\u201d which gets used later as a joke during the \u201ckissing\u201d scene. Kazuma\u2019s second reincarnation goes against the rulebook.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also uses references from earlier episodes as jokes for later. Kazuma suggests fighting giant toads again, which Megumin and Aqua object to, but Darkness wonders and wants to experience it. The townspeople wait for Kyouya, but he won\u2019t be showing up because Kazuma ruined the guy\u2019s life the episode prior. Megumin mentions that \u201ccrimson demons don\u2019t go to the bathroom,\u201d and, while at the mansion, the entire bathroom debacle occurs.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the jokes and the parody leave little room for a thematic presence. Not that KonoSuba needs to have one, but it does try to inject one idea regardless: Life in this new world is not as glamorous as Kazuma was led to believe.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this appeal also represents one of the show\u2019s only major weaknesses. In many of the episodes, Kazuma gives some (thought-only) variation about how much he hates \u201cthis wonderful world\u201d (to use the anime\u2019s title).\\n\\n\r\nThe final words of the season reflect this not-so-subtle direction well, but it\u2019s episode seven that demonstrates why the idea is an issue.\\n\\n\r\nKazuma\u2019s second afterlife scene, where he \u201ccomplains\u201d about the troubles he went through, adopts a sentimental tone that the anime actively avoids. It\u2019s one of the only kindhearted moments in the entire season.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, this scene offers the other perspective. That maybe a silver lining exists around the various troubles he encountered. Yet the show rips that thought away when, once again, Kazuma laments that he \u201cmade the wrong choice\u201d on getting brought back as the episode concludes.\\n\\n\r\nNow, to be fair, this idea is part of the parody. I.e., poking fun at such an emotional moment fits the premise. But that still does not excuse the show\u2019s inelegant handling of this centralized concept. Especially when its other elements are handled with more execution.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba\u2019s artistic direction leads to a small debate.\\n\\n\r\nOn the one end, the anime\u2019s singular setting keeps the show from branching out. In fact, the same area just outside of the town\u2019s gate is visited four times: once with the cabbages, twice with Verdia, and once with Destroyer. It wouldn\u2019t be much of a problem if the location itself was teeming with detail, but it\u2019s just an unassuming, boring spot for action to occur. Almost as if the anime didn\u2019t know where else to go.\\n\\n\r\nOther backgrounds are likewise not as appealing. A snowy plain, a large lake, and a shot of the stables are certainly appropriate but devoid of creativity.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other end, the anime can prove itself. The inside of the local inn has patrons, bar maids, and other facets \u2013 such as light fixtures, wooden tables, and the nearby quest board \u2013 that make the building a hub of activity. Quaint shots of the city streets, accompanied by soft lighting, give the anime a homely feel, contrasting with Kazuma\u2019s oft derision of the world. And the anime can visit different spots: the succubus brothel, their mansion, and Wiz\u2019s store to name a few.\\n\\n\r\nAll of which says nothing of the minor details. Lips are sometimes fully drawn, eyes sparkle with intricacies, and clothes crinkle and crease. Added details that may not be expected but are certainly welcome.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime further proves its clout when one of its \u201cnegatives\u201d ends up being a positive overall: roughness. Uneven lines, misplaced eyes, and wonky facial expressions are normally turn-offs, but, in KonoSuba\u2019s case, this roughness in the art elevates the comedy and hence the appeal of the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the unchanging location and the roughness, actual animation sees a lot of attention. Aqua\u2019s eyes moving to see if the others are still watching her cry. Megumin going through some karate moves. Darkness unable to control her excitement at joining the party. Each an example of KonoSuba\u2019s attention to animated detail.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, the show arguably diverts most of its animation resources into the different sexual bits. Luna, the big-busted quest-giver, always receives extra frames for her breasts. Chris, after her panties are stolen, grabs her crotch rather vigorously. And the leader of the succubus brothel moves, bends, and squishes in all the right places.\\n\\n\r\nIf nothing else, Megumin\u2019s famous \u201cExplosion!\u201d sequences \u2013 with their colors, swirls, and galactic depiction \u2013 demonstrate that both its animation and art are nothing to scoff at.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also plays with perspective. Kazuma running down a hallway in first-person view or Darkness getting really up in the audience\u2019s face showcase different levels of cinematography.\\n\\n\r\nBut, without a doubt, the character designs are easily the best part of the art department.\\n\\n\r\nKazuma\u2019s starting track suit fits the parody direction, and his later shoulder garb finally gives him a sense of heroism. Aqua\u2019s looped hair, embroidered outfit, and revealing-yet-not-quite skirt envelops the goddess with an air of importance. Megumin\u2019s large wizard hat, eyepatch, and mismatched leggings fit her chuunibyou antics splendidly. And Darkness\u2019s long blonde hair, tough armor, and stunning figure highlight both her classiness as well as her sexiness.\\n\\n\r\nYet it\u2019s their coloring and color symbolism that truly shines.\\n\\n\r\nKazuma\u2019s black and green symbolizes his derisive attitude and \u201cgood luck.\u201d Aqua\u2019s blue and pink symbolizes her crybaby personality and \u201csweetness.\u201d Megumin\u2019s red and brown symbolizes her power and her \u201cendurance.\u201d And Darkness\u2019s orange and white symbolizes her enthusiasm and \u201cpurity.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAs can be read, each character has a color associated with him or her that contrasts with what the audience normally perceives, heightening the parody and subconsciously adding to the overall level of comedy the show so regularly achieves.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nWhile KonoSuba\u2019s story and art are intriguing, its lovable troupe of characters make the anime into the comical romp it becomes. Namely, Kazuma, Aqua, Megumin, and Darkness are the champions of the series.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the girls and Aqua more specifically, she is initially pinned as a kindhearted goddess. Sending the deceased to better lives and using holy magic to heal others, she seems helpful and understanding.\\n\\n\r\nBut it quickly becomes apparent that she is not only rather mean but also rather annoying. She constantly cries for Kazuma\u2019s help, and she either has powers that are impractical or overly detrimental.\\n\\n\r\nIn comedic terms, she\u2019s a character that makes the audience feel superior. It\u2019s fun to see her wailing about her snow buddy or about not wanting to teach others her type of magic because of how useless she manages to be. In other words, the audience feels as though they are always in a better position when compared to this crybaby.\\n\\n\r\nMegumin is similar. She\u2019s not rude like Aqua, but she is certainly not without her quirks. Chief among them being her chuunibyou persona. She speaks, dresses, and acts in a fantastical manner, giving her an air of silliness. Her silliness, however, is justified when she displays her immeasurable destructive power through the explosion magic she commands.\\n\\n\r\nAt least, it\u2019s justified until before she unleashes her singular ability. For that\u2019s all she can do. Literally. After using her one spell one time, she is essentially rendered inert, unable to move without the assistance of another.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, in comedic terms, she\u2019s a character that makes the audience feel relief. Her character talks the talk and walks the walk. But when the explosion subsides and the dust settles, she, like Aqua, is useless and hence funny. In other words, she builds up emotion in the audience that is later released (in the form of laughter).\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps obviously at this point, Darkness is similar, too. On the outside, she\u2019s a beautiful woman whose determination to protect the people is laudable. But once one gets to know her, however, they realize that she\u2019s a bit strange. She revels in the pain, the suffering that comes with said protection. To the point that it sexually arouses her. Plus, she cannot even hit stationary targets with her weapon. That\u2019s how pitiful she is at wielding a sword.\\n\\n\r\nAgain (again), in comedic terms, she\u2019s a character that makes the audience feel incongruous. Her immoral behavior and abysmal swordsmanship in no way befits a proud knight, and it\u2019s this stark contrast that makes her useless and therefore funny. In other words, her unexpected characterization creates comedy.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, Aqua, Megumin, and Darkness each exemplify a different \u201cbrand\u201d of humor. It\u2019s what gives the anime so much comedy clout. The show relies on a unified motif of uselessness, but, by branching out into different forms of comedy, KonoSuba manages to appeal to many people.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Kazuma, he gets the brunt end of the stick. When he gets a new chance at another life, he discovers that it\u2019s not much better than his old one. Indeed, it\u2019s worse. A final goal so daunting that he chooses instead to accept his current fate. A set of situations so harrowing that he refuses to do anything even remotely dangerous. A group of friends so aggravating that it\u2019s a wonder he makes it through the day in one piece.\\n\\n\r\nKazuma is fed up with all of these problems, taking it out on said friends. He berates Aqua for wasting all of their money. He chastises Megumin for her one-and-done approach. He harps on Darkness for her masochistic tendencies.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s understandable. Most people in his position would most likely have similar feelings. It\u2019s human nature to complain when the going gets tough, when life hands one lemons, and any other related clich\u00e9.\\n\\n\r\nFor this reason, it makes Kazuma relatable and therefore likable. Where the rest of the town sees the girls as members of the best class roles and saviors of the city, the audience sympathizes with Kazuma and his mindset because they get to see what the arch-priest, the arch-wizard, and the crusader are actually like.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, the girls aren\u2019t completely useless. Aqua brings water to those who need it, Megumin obliterates the competition, and Darkness boosts the morale of others. And it\u2019s precisely for this reason that Kazuma\u2019s constant negativity comes off as hilarious. In other words, since the audience knows that the girls can be useful, when they aren\u2019t (which is most of the time), Kazuma\u2019s scathing words are more than justified and therefore comedic.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the anime does not give much more to their characters beyond their fleshed-out characterizations. Kazuma\u2019s previous life, Aqua\u2019s religious sect, Megumin\u2019s own \u201crace,\u201d and Darkness\u2019s rich family are alluded to but never shown.\\n\\n\r\nGiven the show\u2019s shortened season (ten episodes as opposed to twelve or thirteen) and the show\u2019s nearly pure focus on comedy, it may be unreasonable for one to expect the cast to have more of a background let alone development.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, them lacking more to their characters leads to them relying on their shticks again and again. Aqua only ever cries, Megumin only ever yells out her catchphrase, Darkness only ever gets turned on, and Kazuma only ever speaks the (harsh) truth.\\n\\n\r\nIt can get repetitive, but, thankfully, their strong comedic roots keep this issue in check for the majority of the season.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nArguably speaking, the single strongest aspect of KonoSuba is its ending track.\\n\\n\r\nTitled \u201cChiisana Boukensha,\u201d this ED is one of the best to ever grace the medium. The beat\u2019s methodical calmness instills a sense of peace and elation. Aqua, Megumin, and Darkness sing both individually and in harmony, their voices both tranquil and sincere. And the country-farm tone \u2013 with its banjo, flute, drums, and other atmospheric instruments \u2013 captures the down-to-earth, everyday life that the lovable cast never gets to have. It\u2019s a phenomenal track that deserves as much praise as possible. Now and for years to come.\\n\\n\r\nWhile nothing else in the sound department comes close to the ED, the voice-acting performances are fantastic in their own right. Sora Amamiya as Aqua brings hilarity in droves with her crying, screams, and arrogant manner. Rie Takahashi as Megumin chants her way to \u201cExplosion!\u201d cuteness. And Ai Kayano as Darkness, with her impassioned speeches and seductive moans, provides attractiveness in more ways than one.\\n\\n\r\nJun Fukushima as Kazuma also deserves a shout-out. Mostly for his mean-spirited speaking. But he also introduces even more comedy with his occasional interjections. Responding with \u201cYes, I\u2019m Kazuma\u201d when the girls try to get his attention, asking \u201cReally?\u201d as they talked during dinner time, and getting in a \u201cBring it\u201d as Wiz prepares to \u201csuck\u201d him made for some silly adlib moments that fit the anime more than well.\\n\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack is also praiseworthy, for while it does not have the same high level of execution as the ED and the voice acting, it\u2019s not without its own strengths. The rap-like, ukulele track is both catchy and fun. The soft, simple piano piece makes those heartwarming moments that much warmer. And the individualized tracks for each character \u2013 Kazuma\u2019s heroic tune, Aqua\u2019s church choir, Megumin\u2019s otherworldliness, and Darkness\u2019s promiscuous ladies \u2013 add further to their overall characterizations.\\n\\n\r\nLastly (and perhaps least) sits the opening track. Guitar, chimes, and drums create an optimistic and lofty OP, taking a contrasting direction when compared to both its ED counterpart and the anime itself. The ending segment with the stepping violin gives the track a final flourish that gets the audience prepared for the comedy to come. It\u2019s not exactly strong, but KonoSuba\u2019s other sound offerings more than make up for the passable OP. (The ED alone covers it and then some.)\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely love this one.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there\u2019s a reason for that. It doesn\u2019t always happen in an anime for me, but this one managed to achieve the ever elusive dream: I am fully a fan of each character.\\n\\n\r\nFor Kazuma, him speaking aloud his disapproval of the others was never tiring. Getting ready to punch Aqua for her deliberate attempt at sympathy. Telling Megumin to use a nearby vase to pee in. Forcing Darkness, without reproach, to lather him up in the bath hall. He\u2019s a likable central protagonist through and through.\\n\\n\r\nFor Aqua, her overreactions had me laughing out loud. When she was excited to beat up Kazuma for him defending the \u201cevil\u201d succubus (Aqua\u2019s eyes especially). When she bawled about needing money or help. When she acted like she didn\u2019t want praise but actually did. She\u2019s incredibly annoying yet insanely funny.\\n\\n\r\nFor Megumin, her chuunibyou behavior was always welcome. Her floating down a puddle of water to get closer to Darkness to give her a thumbs up. Her pretending to be dead in the snow. Her caressing her arch-wizard\u2019s staff due to the drug-like addiction she has with explosions. She\u2019s small in stature, but she left a large impression.\\n\\n\r\nFor Darkness, her attractiveness had me hooked. Getting pushed into the snow turned her on. When she smiled from embarrassment while admitting her faults in fighting. Her willing to protect her friends as the crusader she is. She\u2019s sexy, interesting, and amazing.\\n\\n\r\nKazuma, Aqua, Megumin, and Darkness are just so much fun that it didn\u2019t matter what they were doing on-screen. I knew I could count on them to make me laugh. And I know they will continue to do so when that second season eventually rolls around.\\n\\n\r\nKonoSuba is a comedy adventure. With extremely hilarious characters, amazing sound-work, and parody for days, it\u2019s a wonderful anime that nobody should be afraid to say \u201cHellooooo\u201d to.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, an adventurous parody with smartly reused jokes and subtle in-narrative references, brought down by an overstated complaint about the world being too tough\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, despite the unchanging location, positives like the comically rough art, the above average levels of actual animation, and the superb character designs are visually pleasing to see\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, the main cast\u2019s strong comedic roots are hampered by their overused shticks caused by there not being a whole lot more to their characters\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, one of the best ED\u2019s in the medium, fantastic voice-acting performances, and a nice OST overcome the passable OP\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, Kazuma, Aqua, Megumin, and Darkness are a downright awesome group of adventurers\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

Every episode feels like a different story and it is going nowhere. The girls in the series I would rate average. The blue hair girl is really funny and would rate a 10 but it goes back down to a 2 because of her hair color. Im not one to judge someone buy their looks but I do not like this girl because of her blue hair. Blue is just not my favorite colorand never will be. The art of the story is okay I mean it is the art for any average anime not bad not good. The sounds were cool like the explosions from that loli or whatever. It was enjoying on the ecchi scenes but its only Tv-14 so im like whatever. If ur friend wants you to watch this dont.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This show really knows how to do comedy right. It plays around with cliches instead of becoming one, and the every dialogue feels like it's part of a skit ( there'a a lot of that Japanese \"konto\" style humour).\r\nThe premise is simple and funny enough that you don't have to think or wonder about (like you might with Overlord, Log Horizon, etc.), the characters are great, and you can see that the main thing the entire studio focused on was the humour. The drawing, the movements, the sound effects, the quickness of the witty replies, the voice acting, everything is centred around humour, and itWORKS.\\n\\n\r\nI loved how Kazuma will reply to anyone calling him to \"Yes, I'm Kazuma\" RIGHT AFTER he gets called, and in quick, low volume addition that gets IGNORED by the caller. It's probably a common joke in high schools or comedy skits in Japan, but we get to see it in anime with fresh eyes.\\n\\n\r\nMegumin's voice actor is simply amazing. Even in simple scenes she adds character. E.g. When Kazuma first meets her, he pulls on her fake eye-patch, and she shouts \"Yame, yamero!!\", but instead of just keeping it a monotone and upset shout, she adds this commanding, growling tone in the middle to kinda give it a \"How dare you! How about you stop?!\" feeling. Excellent!\\n\\n\r\nIt's a great comedy show, totally worth a 9/10.",

            "content": "This is a funny and entertaining anime. \r\nThe premise is similar Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? but more self-aware. More accurately, it is a parody of Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? and the dungeon-crawler/video game genre. The best part of this anime is that it is really funny. In fact, it\u2019s one of the funniest animes I\u2019ve seen in a while. \r\nStory: While the story isn\u2019t exactly original, it\u2019s well executed. I also like that it starts with a premise and sticks to it. This gives each episode a sense ofconsistency and allows one to get immersed. I will say a word of caution about the plot. It isn\u2019t so much a story, rather it is more similar to the slice-of-life genre. The characters do have a goal and work towards it but it does take a back seat to daily life. The episodes focus more on the journey rather than the destination. If you like a story with a single, overarching conflict as the focus then you won\u2019t enjoy this anime. Instead, what\u2019s makes this amine great is the humor, the world it creates, it\u2019s parodic nature, and the character\u2019s interactions. I would say that the characters are another good aspect. The main character is a \u201cfish out of water\u201d which makes him really relatable. The other characters are not as deep as they would be in a drama, nor should they be. They have the perfect amount of depth to be both funny and interesting. It\u2019s actually one of the few instances where the perfect balance is achieved. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Sound: The animation is pretty good but where this anime shines is in the voice acting. It is fantastic. The voices have depth and range. They complement the character and the character\u2019s situation perfectly. They are so good that they make the jokes even funnier.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it\u2019s funny and really worth watching. \\n",

            "content": "Disclaimer: this counts as a review for both seasons and\r\nso, a bunch of months ago i watched konosuba and was pretty disappointed considering the praise and popularity it had received and gave it a mid-5 mark. Still, i thought maybe i hadn't given it a fair chance considering i had binge watched the whole 20 episodes of both seasons in the last 10 hours of a 30 hour day. Sleep deprivation is not typically associated with sound judgement, so recently, i decided to rewatch it.  \r\nKonosuba is a low-6. That's not much better.\r\nThere are 2 things i really like about Konosuba andi will lie about both of them. The first thing to mention are the excellent characters, Megumin being a mage who can only use Nuke magic and then fall-down is very funny, Darkness being a masochist who loves to take damage is very funny and Aqua being a god of tremendous power who is simply too stupid to use it is also very funny. Oh and Kazuma's an asshole. Guess that's somewhat funny too. Yeh, ok not really. the reason why this is a lie though is that now you have read those few lines you know about everything there is to know about those 4 main characters. darkness gets a bit of backstory in the first half of season 2 and that's it but except for that you don't learn more about the characters or see them change throughout the whole 20 episodes of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe second good point (which is a lie, remember?) is the format. Konosuba follows a very simple format, each episode a different problem is brought before the party and they have to resolve it and in doing so they (mostly Aqua) fuck up in a way that will cause the next problem to arise later. this makes the series pretty bite-sized, one which you can drop and pick back up rather easily. Now, the lie is that a lot of episode are actually just filler. Like kazuma says: \"hey guys, let's go kill some snow flakes\" or \"hey guys, let's go kill some lizards\" and twenty minutes of real time later they come back having gained and lost nothing. \\n\\n\r\nnow, now, this is a character driven full-comedy show, no matter what the one important thing is for the jokes to be funny. as long as the jokes are funny, nothing else really matters. And the jokes are funny! oh wait, that was another lie wasn't it?  \\n\\n\r\nTHE JOKES ARE FUNNY BUT I CAN COUNT THEM ON MY HANDS.\\n\r\nKazuma's disrespectful, Kazuma's a pervert, Aqua is unlucky, Aqua is Stupid, Darkness is a masochist, Darkness can't hit anything, Megumin's likes weird names, Megumin loves explosions, Yun-yun is antisocial and the world of adventurers isn't all that dreamy. those are all the jokes. ALL OF THEM. there are a few genuinely funny things every now and then that aren't repeated into oblivion but overall the jokes for the main cast are always the same thing. over and over again. it gets tiring pretty fast.\\n\\n\r\ni might be slightly exaggerating here, there were a few episodes that would have been mid-high-7 if they were to be judged alone. I'm thinking of S1E10, S2E4 and S2E5 in particular. i also really liked the verdas episode (and his character in general) and the joke that the eris currency suffers from inflation because eris pads her chest... hehe. that one's clever and subtle... i like it!  \\n\\n\r\nnow that the main complaints are out of the way, lightning round!: the music is rather unmemorable, with the ops and eds being just one level above that. The voice acting is actually really good but sometimes it doesn't match the animation, i'm thinking of that one scene in S1E9 where a guy is seen laughing while he just talks normally sound-wise. speaking of speaking, the mouths and facial features look kind of gross/misplaced/ deformed at times, some of those times it's the intended effect while others i can't help but feel like the makers fucked up. the art in general is generic and so is most of the character design outside the three main girls. i guess that shot of the hotspring town from above was pretty. that's about it\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\r\nKonosuba gets a low-6 for being bogged down by it's abusive plot/joke recycling as well as for its rather unimpressive technical prowesses. there are a few things to be caught in a rewatch so that makes it just about break through the ceiling and up to a mid-6 for both season.\\n\\n\r\nRecommendations:\\n\r\n1. If you want a good character-driven comedy and won't mind a little side dish of SoL and Romance i would recommend Working!! over konosuba any day even if it means you lose a bit in the sexually-daring department.\\n\r\n2. If you're not willing to take the love-bullshit that Working!! will inevitably be serving i would recommend Hinamatsuri. there's more deep-feeling stuff but i think there's also a greater chance of getting your money's worth in the laugh department.\\n\r\n3. Finally, of course, i have to say it, if you're slowly crawling towards sleep deprivation, are maybe a bit drunk, and just want to have a mindless laugh while also probably wanting to destroy a good portion of your functioning neurons. Well there's only one anime it can be right? say it with me. *eyes shine red* *red filter applies* *image Jpgifies itself* THe ;b:phOne ANIme!!1!",

            "content": "It's been done to death. Fantasy RPG-themed show, hero is a former Earthling who is given a second shot at life but in a different world.\r\nFrom the outset, you know this isn't like Re:Zero, because one of the first things the goddess guiding Kazuma to another world does is laugh herself silly at the circumstances around his death, and at the same time this scene gives you an idea of just how the dynamics of the characters are going to roll. After telling Kazuma he can take one amazing skill or object to his new life, she quickly becomes bored and busies herself with somechips.\\n\\n\r\nSo Kazuma does the natural thing and tells said goddess to come along as his chosen object.\\n\\n\r\nIf it isn't clear at this point, this is a parody of every RPG-themed anime that mercilessly makes fun of fantasy. Introducing the party... we have a NEET hero who is average at everything but luck and specializes in fighting dirty, an incredibly stupid monster magnet goddess (no one believes her) with great stats in everything but intelligence, a chuunibyou arch wizard who can cast the most powerful spell in the world (but only that spell, and only once per day), and a tank who can't hit anything and is a huge masochist (her actress is Ai Kayano, and honestly Grancrest would've been far more interesting if that other buxom blonde voiced by Kayano acted like Darkness). Taking this team into a raid in your typical RPG will naturally get them killed, so this party seldom leaves the starting town, and manages to defeat several mini-bosses largely through sheer luck. And yet, watching this party of misfits get themselves in the silliest situations is the single best running gag of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is not unlike Monty Python and the Holy Grail or Red Dwarf: a series of loosely related comedic sketches, and the joke punch lines are often of the \"yank the rug\" type. Gags often involve a character getting denied what they want most, which is effective largely because you know from their personality or situation that they absolutely do not deserve it. Other gags involve the party getting in serious trouble because one or more members get carried away (and the show is quick to remind you that even the seemingly serious situations are jokes).\\n\\n\r\nWhile the backgrounds are mainly bog-standard CG, and the character designs mainly designed for comic effect or titillation (because there's always that chauvinist who wants girls who are more boobs than brains high up in the production chain) more than anything, the special effects, mainly spells, are well-executed, and is a great setup to several jokes, whether it's Aqua getting slimed or Megumin throwing her only spell every day for a few months.\\n\\n\r\nThe character animations felt... cheap to me, as though the tween animators weren't given enough time to draw detailed motion and thus were forced to avoid drawing whole frames as much as possible. The result here is repetitive motions, heavy reliance on still or mostly-still frames (you can see this most prominently in dialogue-heavy scenes), and other shortcuts that were common back in the 1980s-1990s; juxtaposed with more detailed action scenes, this makes the animation look inconsistent or jerky. Sometimes this worked (usually involving a sobbing Aqua), but in general, it made the show look like a B cartoon. At the end of the day, all the CG in the world can't save bad animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack evokes Nobuo Uematsu and other fantasy RPG composers just a bit (for obvious reasons), with just a little exaggeration in the epic \"quest begin\" and \"quest complete\" fanfares, and a mix of silly themes to help set the comedic stage. The opening theme is a good match to a slapstick-heavy sketch comedy show, and the ending theme eases you out of the episode; the intentional \"cut off the character's letter\" previews are also hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nI'll close by pointing out the title animation with the characters swaying to the music is a good expression of the show itself: \"We're all hopeless in some way or another, but we're having fun together, so that's cool.\"",

            "content": "I remember skipping over Konosuba S1 when it first came out due to being sick of the \"Stuck in another world\" genre the anime community has become well used to seeing by now. That was a mistake, one of my friends highly suggested I checked it out as it brought much more to the table than any other of these stuck in another world animes. See Konosuba takes this beautiful world and shows that just showing up to new world might not be as amazing as people make it out to be.\r\nKazuma, the main protagonist from start to end is one of the most likablemale protagonists I have ever seen in anime. Kazuma always manages to be such a likable character despite being one of the biggest jerks ever. He's such a depressing and rude guy yet THIS is what makes him such a lovable guy, Kazuma is never just given anything, they almost never succeed the first time and often end up having their spirits destroyed. Unlike other \"stuck in another world\" animes they have to constantly be working for what they want despite their many failures, yet they keep moving forward in attempt to get what they want.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is absolutely beautiful and is just straight up fun to look at. There's so much that goes into the artwork. For example, they try to never give the characters the same face twice. It would be much simpler have a set few faces to react to different situations. (happy, sad ,shocked etc) Constantly giving them new faces to react to scenarios really helps with the comedy factor, if they had the same few faces it would get stale seeing the same reaction whenever something funny happened. \\n\\n\r\nKonosuba really puts allot into their back round art, characters who they team talks to maybe once have their own design and unique personality, no one just feels like they're there just because they need characters to make the world look alive. Konosuba also has some of the nicest scenery I've ever seen, In epsiode 8 of S2 when the team arrives at the hot springs town we're treated to this beautiful view of the town and the landscape. This helps you connect to the town and makes you think that this town really is perfect before they reveal why this town may not just be as amazing as you'd think.\\n\\n\r\nI most definitely recommend this anime to EVERYONE, 10% of this anime is just ripping on the \"stuck in another world\" genre and 90% of it is improving with it's beautiful visuals and comedy. Konosuba shows us that this genre can find success without always being depressing and super serious...",

It's funny and just plain fun to watch, without anything really to complain about. \r\nScore: 8/10\r\nStory:\r\nThere isn't really a plot, honestly. Think sitcom. You're just watching a group of people as they do their thing. That said, \"their thing\" is both hilarious and strangely heartwarming, and I didn't really care about the lack of plot. I can't give this aspect a score above average, but it won't affect the overall rating because it didn't really affect the experience.\r\nScore: 5/10\r\nArt:\r\nThere wasn't anything to complain aboutwith the animation. The lack of choppiness and overall polish grants it one point above average, and although there was still some CGI, it was only used in scenes where it wouldn't look dumb. It actually ended up looking pretty alright when it was used, so that's another point above average.\\n\r\nScore: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe intro and outro were pretty average. Not bad, but not particularly good. The music in general though did a great job of matching and enhancing the atmosphere of the other world, good for two points above average. What I really liked about the soundtrack in this anime though was the way each character had their own distinctive music. This was used to highlight which character \"had the floor\" at any given time, and was a nice touch for which I have to add another point.\\n\r\nScore: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWhat's weird about this department is that, even though I'm not really a huge fan of any of the characters individually, they make up one of my favorite groups. The chemistry between them is just perfect. The main character is one of my least favorite protagonists in anime - he's pretty much a scumbag - but the way he reacts to the antics of the other three and the way he compensates for each of their shortcomings is one of my favorite character dynamics in anime. It's just impeccably designed. \\n\r\nScore: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI had a blast watching this anime. It was funny, and it was fun. That's all there is to it.\\n\r\nScore: 9/10",

            "content": "If you're looking for a show with a deep and complex plot, this isn't it.\r\nIf you're looking for a show that takes it self seriously, it's definitely not this.\r\nThat comedy tag is quite justified, this is quite the parody show with just enough story and character development to make it more than a series of jokes.  On paper this show's recipe could easily have gone horrible wrong, but as it is they pretty much nailed it.\r\nOh, and this show is definitely in the \"blatant sexual references\" territory.\r\nThis should be spoiler free, though the character descriptions for Megumin and Darkness should be skipped if youwant to get the full facepalm value out of their introductions.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nFirst up, our \"hero\" Kazuma is a text book Dangerously Genre Savvy character.  Which is actually allowed since he has a plausible in universe reason for having that knowledge.  A standard shut-in trope, he turns out to actually be the most useful character in most situations simply by being normal and thus capable of maintaining rational thought for more than 5 seconds.  He's kind of pathetic at times, but you have to feel sorry for him.\\n\r\nIf you like a smart ass with dry wit, you'll like Kazuma.\\n\\n\r\nNext we have Aqua.  I had a hard time putting my finger on exactly which trope she best fits but I'll go with Beware the Silly Ones.  Deities are supposed to be powerful, wise and all knowing, so go figure that Kazuma gets landed with one that's thick as two short planks and backfires almost as often as she lands an attack.  Obviously she also tends to forget to inform the party of her abilities until after everyone else has freaked out that said ability is necessary.\\n\\n\r\nAs an offensive mage we have Megumin, a character I can only imagine was created from taking the description \"Black Mage Glass Cannon\" and running with it.  She is the physical embodiment of \"Go Big or Go Home\", a character that solves every problem by turning in to a crater.  She's cute, in a constantly face palming kind of way.  She also seems to be sexually attracted to explosions.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, to round out the party we have poor Darkness.  You might think she looks like some kind of Paladin, but you'd be wrong.  See she would have taken the book on how to be a Paladin and thrown it out the window, except she'd likely miss the window.  A literal meat shield most of the time, and entirely aware of it.  To offset the potential for her being pathetic she's also cute and mostly sane and reasonable.  Mostly.  She's stubborn and reckless.  She's also a perverted masochist... this might be handy for a meat shield if she didn't get so turned on by being beaten up.\\n\\n\r\nSurrounding them is a cast of RPG tropes who some how don't come off as being two dimensional, opposing them are some bad guys that seem hilarious when they're not demonstrating genuine lethal capacity.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the story isn't outstanding, but it's not terrible either.  Really the complaint is more that it's so short, rather than that what there is of it is bad.  I figure this will improve when season 2 gets released.  The characters sell the show though.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nNo real complaints on either count, just a few slightly off bits.\\n\r\nThe art is solid even if it isn't classic masterpiece levels of eye candy, the effects look nice and there's not much in the way of blatantly reused footage that I noted.  They probably reused some environmental backgrounds, given the number of scenes that happened in the same core places, but I don't think you'll notice them unless you're specifically looking for them.  I'd give it a 9, but I think they had a little too much fun with some of the scantily clad characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound is similarly solid.  The themes are nice, though they don't quite seem to have gotten stuck in my head the way some have.  Nothing terrible is jumping out at me about the voice acting or the effects.  The only thing that bugged me was that it could be difficult to tell if you were hearing Kazuma speaking or thinking, some more distinction would have been nice.\\n\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\nIt's a parody comedy with adult themes.

            "content": "My first thought on this anime is simply, it's a great experience. It kept me hooked from the beginning and kept me intrigued through-out. This is the first anime in years that has kept me going back for more.\r\nThe story is written in a sarcastic, yet endearing and light way. The clever balance keeps you guessing but also keeps you from creating too much tension. Traditional anime tropes are thrown out for quick (and funny) gags that takes stabs to overly-important anime. When there is depth, it does it well without turning into the thing it wants to parody. Overall, the story is interesting enoughand with strong characters driving the plot forward, it doesn't toss plot for straight parody.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, for the most part, is the everyday man. He has his own personality and commentary. Along with his sometimes impulsive decisions reflect how actual humans work and not shy \"B-But\" anime dudes behave. Again, this reflects back to it's jabs at traditional anime that tries too hard to make the main character an real hero and instead makes him a real human being.\\n\\n\r\nThe music and sound production are great additions too. Mostly the music is played for each scenario, but sometimes used as a joke. The sound quality and production is great, keeping things dynamic and fresh without burning you out with the same 2000s anime sounds that Love Hina made popular.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's an enjoyable anime, definitely not one of the best but an amazing one, indeed.\\n\\n\r\nThe middle ground of self-awareness and story this anime has is a great combination that is sure to make you enjoy the ride. The presentation and pacing keep you watching without making you exhausted from 50 more episodes of standing angry heroes grunting at the villain who is powering up for a super move. Overall, 8/10 (7.5 tbh but this site doesn't like decimals.)",

            "content": "Maybe Kazuma shouldn't have picked the \"Party Hard\" option. *ba-dum-tish*\r\nStory:\r\nKazuma died (hilariously) and now has the choice to either go to heaven or to an RPG fantasy world. Due to circumstances he drags the goddess giving him this choice with him into the RPG world and now they have to do what people in RPGs do. This is clearly a parody of anime like Sword Art Online & co. And it does a great job. All the genre awareness of Kazuma and the (somewhat) uselessness of his comrades make for a great comedy that hardly anybody expected to be this good. But it is, verygood.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI personally didn't mind, but the artwork is merely mediocre. In some episodes this is more visible, in others less. They did a good job with special effects like Megumins explosions, but the character designs could have been better. Fans of the light novel will be especially disappointed, as the original art looked much more amazing.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening and ending were fair enough, nothing that blows you away but nice to the ear. The background music was not too special, but also fair enough (with maybe the exception of Megumins spell casting, that sounded pretty cool). However, the voice acting was really great. Aqua sounded as annoying as possible, Kazuma sounded very sarcastic and pissed off, Megumin sounded cute but determined and Darkness sounded noble and horny. All the side characters did well too.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI loved them. Being parodies of RPG characters, they are unique enough to stand on their own feet. Instead of being a love interest to the male mc, Aqua was a huge annoyance to him. Kazuma himself was not heroic at all, but a huge prick. Megumin was the most \"normal\" of the main cast, but very entertaining as well. The only one lacking a bit characterization was Darkness. I'm sure there's more to her, but we didn't see it yet, so in this first season she's merely a running gag. The rest of the cast did what they had to do, only Wiz got a little more spotlight as a nice lich.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe most important aspect of a comedy is to make the viewer laugh. I'm a tough customer when it comes to that, but KonoSuba made me laugh my ass off (literally, I had to glue it back on). Even if you haven't seen any RPG anime before, there are still tons of jokes and funny scenes one can enjoy. The humor often comes at the expense of the characters, which could be considered \"mean\" by some, but never are they portrayed as completely unlikeable. This sleeper hit of Winter 2016 is a good choice if you are in need of a good laugh [/shameless shilling].\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n8.2/10",

            "content": "Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Sh... WAY TOO LONG.\r\nThe shortened version, KONOSUBA is what I will refer it as from now on. And don't worry if you forget that nickname because the show will be sure to remind you of it every 5 minutes. But that's not a bad thing: even the anime itself acknowledges that its title is way too long but at least they're not taking it seriously. Anyway, let's start the actual review.\r\nKonosuba is a comic approach on the traditional \"sent to a fantasy world\" setting. In fact, it is more of a satirical story - every element of the story (be itsetting, characters, plot, etc.) is taken from the traditional RPG world we are used to and made fun of. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is basically about a guy called Kazuma who dies and after being told by a goddess that he can be reincarnated with a single wish into a fantasy world, he chooses to drag her along with him into this RPG-like new adventure. Since this is not what the goddess wanted, the both of them are now set on a quest to defeat the Demon Lord: thing that will allow the goddess to go back home and Kazuma to having actually accomplished something this time around.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the actual progression of the story towards that goal is rather... odd. The pacing is so random that at times the anime feels like a slice of life and at times it feels like important progression is actually being made. It is so weird that even when something does happen I couldn't figure out if it actually any significance for the future in terms of plot advancement. You might thing that this is bad and to be honest, in most cases it is in fact a deal-breaker. But to my enjoyment, not here.\\n\\n\r\nBecause who cares about pace when you're laughing your ass off constantly? \\n\\n\r\nI will have to admit I don't laugh very often in front of anime. I am usually reluctant to watch comedies as they very often use the same old jokes over and over and are filled with clich\u00e9s. But for once, I found Konosuba to have a refreshing humour and although some of the jokes are nothing new, the situations and personality of the characters more than make up for that in most cases.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that makes this whole comedy work is how well every funny element fits within the story. Unlike many, many mediocre or at most decent comedies, every joke, every funny trait of character and every irregularity is actually part of the overall story and kept as part of its setting. \\n\\n\r\nTo illustrate what I am saying, here is an example: at the beginning of the anime, we are introduced to a creature akin to a big frog. This is a low level monster that our main characters have to defeat in order to \"level up\", just like your usual slime. It turns out that these frogs get our main heroine all slimy and that's basically the joke. Good. But to keep the consistency of the story, these frogs that would usually get dismissed as soon as the joke is finished, are continually being referenced or reintroduced later on. \\n\\n\r\nTo me, this is what makes this comedy a very good one. The technique of repeating the same patterns of speech over and over again is abused, but in a refreshing and fitting way that actually fleshes out the character. For instance, the way our protagonist Kazuma often says \"Yes, yes, I'm Kazuma\" whenever one of his teammates is being stupid or perverted is something I found particularly amusing and it helped me understand what kind of person Kazuma is a bit better (essentially someone who really can't be bothered with this crap anymore).\\n\\n\r\nNow that this is out of the way, onto the not-so-good. Konosuba's primary weakness is most likely its animation. While I heard some people criticizing the artstyle, I would say that this is debatable and it may please some. The backgrounds are actually pretty well done. However, the animation isn't exactly something you'd find amazing in 2016. Since this anime has a fair share of fan-service, one of the most noticeable failures of the animation is probably the animation of the famous \"boob physics\". But then again, I don't think most people watch Konosuba for its ecchi so much as for its comedy so the animation is probably not as important. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters fulfilled their roles of being funny to me and that's mainly due to their personality. The main characters are often performing the usual \"boke and tsukommi routine\" (basically the idiot and the straight man) with our protagonist always being the tsukommi (straight man). I have to say though, what makes the characters so damn funny is probably how well the voice actors performed. Not only for the main cast but also the side character. Every one of them was acted as if they had an importance of their own, even when they didn't. And this brings me to another point about the characters that I found hilarious: even minor characters whose names are not even introduced are memorable. They are memorable because as mentioned before, they actually belong in this setting and they are seen multiple times, no matter how little attention is put on them. Even the unnamed crowd is full of people that we see over and over again, instead of just random nobodies.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, the OP is nothing to talk about and the ED fits the anime rather well I thought: using traditional instruments to give off a fantasy vibe and a slow pace to reflect the fact that the show takes things at its own pace. One track in particular that I found memorable was the choir played during the preparation of the spell \"Explosion\". The fact that it is so intense and at the same time contrasts with the often silly casting time of the spell which literally always varies in length for no actual reason is pretty funny.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Konosuba was a breath of fresh air in terms of comedy. Honestly, it felt like I was watching an episode of \"SAO: Abridged\". And that is a compliment. This is obviously not an anime you want to watch if aiming for a serious show but if you feel like turning off your brain, then this is probably amongst the funniest anime I could recommend you to watch.\\n\\n\r\nReally looking forward to season 2.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The premise is about Kazuma Satou voiced by ''Jun Fukushima'' an ordinary high school student, gamer and NEET who died from an average day walking from home trying to save someone. He reawakens in the afterlife and is greeted by a rude goddess Aqua voiced by ''Sora Amamiya'' telling him that he can either go to heaven or be resurrected in an RPG world to defeat the Demon King, she also tells him that he can bring one thing into this world, after much deliberation and annoyance, Kazuma brings the GODDESS into the world. Thus hilarity ensues as Kazuma and Aqua enters the RPG world,but can they survive this RPG world?. Ok so this is a comedy anime that takes many of the \"guy goes into the RPG world and becomes a badass\" cliches and turns it up it's head and makes fun of it. For example, within the premise, once Kazuma and Aqua enter the RPG world, they join a guild and in order for them to even get money and have a stable income, they do CONSTRUCTION work just to get by, that's playing against LA's expectations. The comedy is rather sadistic but for what comedy is well LA knows it's subjective but still comedy is about \"laughing at someone else's misery\" and it does it brutally but with \"punchlines\" with some very good timing and LA loves this anime because of it. The characters are also \"playing against the norm\" from typical \"badass\" going into a RPG world cliches, the main protagonist Kazuma is utterly weak in battle with some thief stats but has HUGE amount of karmic/great luck, Aqua is magically potent but has little intelligence, Megumin voiced by ''Rie Takahashi'' an Explosion Mage can only do ONE spell and that usually ends up doing collateral damage AND ends up making Megumin fatigued due to how much magic she expends, finally the last member of Kazuma's party is Darkness voiced by ''Ai Kayano'' a masochist knight who can't HIT anything due to her low accuracy who revels in being in pain (taking the term Tank into a comedic level), Megumin has to be LA's favourite character as her explosion gag can get inventive considering how it was used in the anime's plot, Darkness' masochist gag can be funny similar to Megumin's, however Aqua can be annoying as all she does complain, and Kazuma although he can be a huge douche at times, it can be even worse when interacting with Aqua, but due to the comedy LA kinda wants to see them MORE in this misery for the SAKE of comedy, see what LA means by the comedy being rather brutally sadistic?. Whether it be sadistic or not, it's still funny as hell and LA won't take that KonoSuba is one of the funniest animes from Winter of 2016 because of it. Now in terms of animation, well done by Studio Deen, the character designs are the biggest hit for this animation, with the battles and backgrounds taking a better look at the animation, however LA kinda finds it funny that the character designs are \"weak\" although it kinda emphasizes the entire \"playing against the guy going into an RPG world and becoming a badass\" into the animation with it's weak character designs (though the character designs do look unique at least). LA will note that the plot does have interweaving sub-plotlines that allows the plot to move forward through the parties actions (though there are some plotlines that are isolated cases within the one episode) that makes the comedy even better. How is the ending?, well even though they make it climactic as possible it's kinda brings in what it is typical of KonoSuba with that karmic luck added in for good measure. Overall there's not much LA can say but KonoSuba is one of the best comedy anime of Winter 2016 and LA can't wait to see more, ohh wait..they just announced a second season~!!!. YASHHHHH~!!!.",

Well, KonoSuba: God's Blessing on This Wonderful World! is the perfect show for you!  Let's go on an adventure!!!  \r\nSide note:  Don't take that introduction even with a grain of salt, this world is fucking terrible.\r\nStory:  Satou Kazuma is your average NEET in the countryside.  Being a lover of games, anime, manga, what have you, Kazuma finally set foot outside his hovel of a room tobuy a limited edition game (or something) until he...well, died.  (It's unfortunate, I know, but when you hear how he died, it's actually quite the story.)  As such is with life, he was given the chance to go to either go to heaven or into a different world thanks to the 'supreme goddess Aqua-sama' granting him a second chance at life.  Thinking that he would go onto some grand adventure, Kazuma jumps on the opportunity to go on the adventure of a lifetime after snatching the goddess away with him...only to find out that this world is more trouble than it's actually worth.  Oh boy.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Konosuba largely revolves around Kazuma's new life as an adventurer in this new world.  As with all shows that follow a fantasy RPG storyline, he is given stats, goes on quests, gains experience, etc, with just a little...hit of real world realism put into it.  Because instead of an idealistic 'defeat the demon lord' story where Kazuma journeys to the edge of the world/dark realm or some shit, we are instead treated to the life of a freelancer who doesn't have a sustainable source of income solely because he is someone who does odd jobs for people who pin tasks and requests on a corkboard.  It's a very refreshing way of going at this style of story as it satirizes practically every aspect of a traditional fantasy RPG from the way the supposed 'evil' characters act, to the repercussions with every task.  (So...much debt.  Just...so much debt.)\\n\\n\r\nHonestly though, that's all the story really has to offer.  Every new episode is a new episode that had the characters deal with a new quest or event that occurs, before having them claw their way out of the situations they're placed in due to either their own incompetence and idiocy or because things just don't turn out the way they want them to.  Usually both.  Its story is light and easy to follow and largely has a balance of both story and character as neither aspect really takes over one another and the series just sort of drives itself.  The only critique I could really give this show is that there isn't much beyond this satirical comedy, and that the anime is only 10 episodes, much shorter than your average cour.  Even so, there really isn't much to say about Konosuba in the negative aspect.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Satirical comedy (well done, might I add)\\n\r\n+  Light and easy to follow story\\n\r\n+  Character and story meshed well\\n\r\n-  Not much in terms of story beyond its comedic value\\n\r\n-  Only 10 episodes  (Why, Deen, why.  Why no full cour.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  In conjunction with this rather...odd world that we're in in Konosuba, we have an equally strange yet memorable cast to go along with the wackiness that we are introduced here.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, we have Kazuma.  As the leader of this party of idiots, Kazuma is the fish out of water character in this new world as he's thrown into a new place with new rules and new people.  As a character, Kazuma is the definition of common sense or the 'straight man' in this whole show, as he consistently without fail, throws around proper logic to any given situation and often makes rude but true comments on any situation or character he comes across that bounce off the current situation so well.  His constant retorts are often the basis for what makes this show's comedic value and contributes to why he's such a good MC in the first place.  And for the most part, the shit he has to deal with on a daily basis really isn't his fault.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Aqua.  Oh boy...this one.  Aqua is the aforementioned goddess that Kazuma brings into the world with him upon arriving into this 'fantastical world'.  As a goddess, Aqua holds great power and upon arriving, has relatively high stats as mentioned in the series.  However, that's...about as good as she gets.  As a character, Aqua is a whiny, self-absorbed goddess who barely has the competency to heal her party members when they have sustained any sort of damage!  But I digress.  True to her nickname, Aqua is a relatively 'useless goddess' and really doesn't serve much to the series aside from piling up debt from food, piling up more debt from spending too much, and helping out in select fights and being actually useful...only to pile up more debt.  She's a terrible person, but she's entertainingly terrible.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Megumin.  Short and simple, she's a mage with a pension for explosions.  Lots of them.  As the black mage or attack mage of the party, Megumin holds large power and can deal a devastating attack.  Yes, you read that right; A devastating attack.  In search for the ultimate power of explosions, Megumin can channel all of her magic power to cast powerful explosions that will devastate anything they touch.  The nerf to this OPness is that she can only cast it once a day before becoming useless and even immobile for the rest of the day.  That's some balance right there.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, Darkness.  As the tank of the group, Darkness is the character that soaks up all of the damage.  And she's really good at it.  She's also a masochist, a really severe one, and is unable to hit anything due to having terrible accuracy.  Safe to say, this group of misfits is quite the dysfunctional party.  Since none of them can really properly do anything right on the field, the situation usually ends in hilarity coupled with Kazuma's usual retorts in order to make the scene just that much more entertaining.  \\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't much to say in terms of character development since \\n\r\n1) The characters don't really change in terms of development or traits\\n\r\n2) The side characters really don't have much importance in this series aside from providing another obstacle in the episode or adding to the funny.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Memorable main characters\\n\r\n+  Entertaining cast\\n\r\n-   Side characters don't really get all that much attention or importance\\n\\n\r\nArt:  Created by Studio Deen, the infamous studio to have less than average art with their projects, Konosuba...actually looks rather nice.  \\n\\n\r\nThe whole series has a light color palette that's very nice and colorful and, while there are some subtle art issues with how the characters look at times, there really isn't much to say badly towards this series.  It's rather standard compared to animation today but there isn't really anything THAT bad to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nIn particular, the scenes that have Megumin doing her explody shit were honestly rather nicely done since there were an absurd amount of effects and just overall THINGS going on.  Good on you Deen, don't screw up S2.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good art  \\n\\n\r\nSound:  Konosuba's OST really isn't all that fantastic in terms of memorability.  The show has a very calm and peaceful ED to contrast its hyper and upbeat OP with a few choice BGMs for certain scenes like casting certain spells, but there really isn't much to say about the music about this show.  It's good, but it's not THAT good.  (Also, props to Amamimya Sora.  Your voice for Aqua is irritating.  Annoying well done levels of irritating.)\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  Ah, Konosuba.  You are hilarious, I admit.  There really isn't much to say in terms of how much I enjoyed this series since I've basically been singing its praises.  The whole show is just a big ball of hilarious satire on the way games and sometimes even logic works, with a main protagonist that puts shit into perspective in the most assholey yet true way.  It's great, and all faults of the series can be wiped away just because of how great of a character Kazuma is.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this series?\\n\\n\r\nOk, me, is this even a question?  Fuck yes, now let's move on, we're almost done here.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nWell, I can't say 'it ended' cause S2 is confirmed.  So...just for the sake of complaining, it's 10 episodes long.  I hate it when they're this length.  Not that this one in particular was bad, but 10 episode anime has a habit to be bad when I find them.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nYes.  It is properly funny and is a well-made comedy series.  There are honestly no complaints I have about this series cause the whole show is very fluent in its delivery and storytelling without, if any, faults in between.  There are a few certain details that I was sad that they cut, but honestly, it's still a good adaptation regardless and should deserve more attention.  Cause I have not enjoyed a good comedy series in a while.",

            "content": "Writing comedy is weird. Breaking the key points of storytelling work as models for humor. Lack of character development, lack of character empathy, plots with major holes, etc all work as phenomenal jokes. Konosuba might be the first anime comedy I've seen that does comedy right in the way that it intentionally breaks storytelling tropes for the sake of a laugh. \r\nLet's begin with the characters, or I should say \"party\". The main cast includes Kazuma, Aqua, Megumin, and Darkness. Kazuma, the protagonist, has died and been placed into a fantasy RPG world as reincarnation. He is selfish, spiteful, and materialistic. Aqua, the secondary protagonist,is a goddess which Kazuma brings with him after dying. She is also selfish, a crybaby, and has tons of hubris to boot. Megumin is a wizard who only knows \"explosion\" magic, and she can only use it once a day, though she brags about being the greatest arch magician in the world. This is perhaps the only thing which she cares about in the world. Darkness is a paladin who is a sexual masochist in every sense of the word. Through the anime we learn Darkness might be the only person who cares about people other than herself...though it seems that this is truly in spite of her well being. \\n\\n\r\nIt's clear these cast of characters are not typical of anime in any sense of the word. They lack the honor to do purposefully good things for other people on a normal basis. They're really all kind of assholes, which ended up reminding me of Seinfeld more than anything. But this provides a phenomenal basis for comedy: we are okay when these characters are hurt, battered, and bruised. This is what makes the Darkness joke last so long without it feeling bland. \\n\\n\r\nThis leads into another important part of what makes Konosuba so funny: it uses old jokes to ground new jokes and finds ways to implement them in a new and creative way each time. This doesn't just include the various mishappenings on some kind of stereotypical quest. The bases for many of the plot events in the show are the driven primarily by the flaws of the characters. This seems to be the intent of the showrunners.\\n\\n\r\nIt's worth talking about the art style here as well. There's a lot of \"janky\" animation in the show, and this isn't the prettiest anime in any way, but I don't think the show would have worked as well if it was. Take for instance the fanservice through the show. Certainly the animators are capable of drawing the typically sexy girl, but choose much more realistic and odd shapes for the girls in the show. This added to the various layers of irony which plague the sexual innuendos throughout the show, especially in the case of Darkness's character. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP for this show certainly is original, well put-together, fun, and conveys the show's mood. The music wasn't absolutely phenomenal or memorable, but maybe this puts the expectation a bit high for a show with limited budget.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, all of these aspects to Konosuba create an absolutely hilarious and self-aware show. It lacks, in my opinion, the kind of perfection of craft that deserves a perfect rating, but still is phenomenal in its own right. The show's end credits are a sort of homey-feeling montage of the town which the show is set. This somehow works, and I think this is because of the flawed characters. Everyone has unfixable character quirks which plague and shape our everyday lives, and Konosuba's portrayal of characters with this kind of real quality makes it feel kind of homey.\\n\\n\r\nThis kind of complexity is what makes Konosuba a great show.",

The protagonist stronger than the average, the villains that are easily beaten down in the beggining of the show...\r\nWe could actually classify this as a parody. But maybe you don't like some things here... like for example the fan service, the animation ugly bugs that happen sometimes... and the supporting characters used as convenient it is for the show.\r\nBut if youare looking for a funny, non-sense, and very different kind of adventure/fantasy anime, Konosuba is really appropriated!",

            "content": "*spoilers*\r\nKo No Su Ba is another common fantasy world series the likes of which has been plaguing the anime industry for the past 2 years. We start off this series by introducing the main character Kazuma Satou, a reclusive video game nerd who is excited to play a newly released MMORPG. Arriving home on his way from the video game store he notices a girl who he assumes is about to get hit by a car and so he pushes her out of harms way, alas Kazuma is struck by the vehicle and is immediately killed. *ehm* yuyu hakusho intro *ehm*\r\nInterestingly, as soon as hedies he enters this sort of secluded chamber-like place where he meets the second main character, Goddess Aqua! Aqua explains to him how he is dead and that, instead of sending him straight to heaven which quote \"is a boring place where you just float around\" she wants to send him to an alternative mmorpg-like world where he has to defeat the Devil King! Kazuma, not nearly as baffled as he should be, accepts the alternative offer and then Aqua explains how he can take any one power or item with him that will give him an advantage in this world, and so naturally he picks Aqua to take with him.\\n\\n\r\nShortly after, for lack of better words, a wicked time portal travel dimension scene our two main characters realize living in this mmorpg fantasy like world is a little more difficult than they would have imagined. They start off as noobs in this beginners town where they have to build up there levels and make money from doing quests. Kazuma and Aqua decide they need more partners to help with quests and so Megumin and Darkness find there ways into the group, and so now our main lead character Kazuma is surrounded by 3 females lead characters, I wonder what could happen?? No this is not a harem but it damn well did feel like it in some episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAnd so this is how this 10 episode series continued, focusing on quests and some other small story lines. One issue I had with this anime is that I could never really tell how these characters are really progressing, they didn't tell us there levels except in one episode, but there was no context to compare it to so it was pretty much irrelevant. We do figure our early on in this series what skills they're better with such as luck for Kazuma but we don't see or are ever told how there skills progressed. Another issue I had with the series is that its story is as such; kill the Devil King, of whom we never even had one glimpse. They do meet and even fight one of his generals, which was a pretty embarrassing and cringey fight but that happened anyway. In fact, in most fight scenes in this series we see our 3 female main characters doing almost all the fighting begging me to ask the question what is Kazuma good for anyway? \\n\\n\r\nI can continue to go on with many of the little things that annoyed me about this series but I digress, I doubt that the next season of this show is going to make this one anymore entertaining or worthwhile but who knows maybe they'll finally fight the Devil King. Overall this story, characters and my personal enjoyment was just dreadful, art and sound however were above standard and done really well. 4/10.",

I thought it would be just another anime in a fantasy world like Re:Zero or Sword Art Online... Except I was totally wrong.\r\nThis anime is nothing but comedy; the characters are nothing but trolls that just make me laugh.\r\nThere is the powerful and the mightiest Goddess whose intelligence is FAR BELOW average human being so that even her intelligence can't be leveled up(Aqua).\r\nThere is the very strong magewhose magic is so strong that she can't cast a spell for the next 24 hours after using it, making her useless (Megumin).\\n\r\nThere is the crusader with almost infinite hitpoints, except that she can't hit an enemy and only thinks of perverted things (Darkness).\\n\r\nAnd finally, we have the biggest troll ever, a character who thought he died from a truck accident saving a girl, although in real life he had been hit by a tractor and died of shock from thinking that he had died from an accident, who steals panties every single time for some reason whenever he uses his skill, and leads the guild of the crazy madhouse (Kazuma).\\n\\n\r\nCombining these four characters makes nothing but chaos, but in a very humorous way.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nFunny comedy. Why ask for more?

            "content": "This anime is silly and does not take itself seriously. I liked it.\r\nStory:\r\nIT is a non-stop stream of gags centered around various JRPG stereotypes. I've seen people talk about SAO and MMOs when discussing this anime, but I don't see anything like that in the game world, and instead it reminds me of titles like dragon quest. The gags are quite light, blunt and cheap (meaning there are no megaton jokes, that'll cause 15 hour long laughing fit), but there are a lot of them, and they don't really stop. There was one strange episode that was too fanservice-focused compared to the rest of theshow, but aside from that, little to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nSurprisingly solid. Characters are low-detailed, but on few occasions where anime has to display some magic spells, it looks great. There are some instances of CG being used, but those handled fairly well and do not fully feel out of place. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSurprisingly good music, but it is underutilized. Some of the very short themes sound amazing but the anime doesn't focus on them for long enough. I wish they used the music more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nMain character is genre-savvy walking embodiment of sarcasm and reason, the rest are mostly stereotyptes. At least one character looks like complete copy of Rurumo from Majimoji Rurumo, but that's just another stereotype. They don't develop across the series, their main purpose is to demonstrate gags displayed by the story. They aren't deep, but are certainly entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIt was much more interesting than I expected. I expected a fairly bad show, and got a fairly interesting one instead.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nGood if you want a quick laugh or a quick chuckle or two. It is no master piece, but it is surprisingly nicely done. Just don't expect anything deep from it. It is light hearted silly fun kind of show that pokes fun at JRPGs and does not really take itself seriously.",

            "content": "Overall Verdict (5/10):  The show's foundation is comedy and lewdness, at the expense of story.  I found the comedy and video-game world to be a detriment to what could have been an intriguing cast.  It's not that the comedy isn't well done, it's just too much.\r\n(Recommendation at the end of the review.)\r\nStory (2/10):  The story is episodic.  The show focuses mostly on the character's living conditions rather than them moving toward goals or developing as characters.  The video game tropes feel like they're getting in the way of the story rather than enhancing it.  For example, skills areacquired not by training or careful decision, but just at a whim.  Quests are chosen from a board or shouted over a loudspeaker, completed, and hardly spoken of again.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10):  Heavily lewd in the form of skin-tight clothes and jiggle physics.  But the art is expressive and does the job.  The party mage's special effects are satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10):  A mix of good and bad.  Aqua's irritating voice almost forced me to quit the show.  However, the sound design is overall good.  Nothing broke my immersion, the background music isn't repetitive.  However the real gem of the show is the party mage's casting. The sound of it building, and her cast shout are absolutely iconic and a must experience.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (4/10):  A mix of good and bad.  All of the extras are forgettable.  The party characters are interesting and I wanted more, but the writing does them no justice. The party members' backstories are never flushed out in any detail, and their gimmicks are what define them.  The show's heavy reliance on comedy blocks any real emotional or weighty interactions between the cast members.\\n\\n\r\nHOW TO WATCH:  I recommend to start watching because there are characters worth knowing who they are, particularly Aqua and the mage's character.  If you're not enjoying the show, you won't miss much by quitting partway.  I would recommend Episode 6 is a good stopping point.  (I say this having not watched Season 2.  Might want to check there to see if I changed my mind.)",

            "content": "Right from the first episode, this anime secures itself as one of the funniest animes out there in the Fantasy genre.  At no point in time does it every relinquish that title, from episode 1 to episode 10. (Episode 5 is especially hilarious.).  \r\nThe story follows the similar refrain that you find in fantasy genres nowadays, in that an average loser/NEET (Kazuma) is teleported to another world to be the protagonist in an RPG-styled world.  And while that concept has definitely been played out in recent years, with many animes trying to follow in the footsteps of Sword Art Online, this animenails it, by going in the direction of complete absurdist comedy.  It definitely works based off of the hilarious main characters, Kazuma, Aqua, Megumin and Darkness.  \\n\\n\r\nOf the characters, Kazuma and Aqua stand out the most.  Shrewd, lacking in principles without being blatantly villainous, selfish and deeply flawed people, they are not like your typical starring duo in these types of animes.  And I have to point out I especially love the fact that Kazuma was handled in a way that wasn't scared to death of sexual encounters, and while perverted, not overly so to the point of where his perversion was nose-bleed cliched.   \\n\\n\r\nNow, Kunosuba isn't without it's flaws, either.  The animation is on the low quality side, very similar to that of Log Horizon.  But, it doesn't take away from the anime.  The score is pretty mediocre, just a typical fantasy music score, lots of flutes, like you would expect.  But, what does hurt the anime is Episode 8-10.  Because this is a truncated anime, not a 13 episode season, but only 10, after episode 8, things just start developing without appropriate connection in story telling.  When I watched episode 8, I had to do a double take and make sure I didn't miss an episode.  It felt like I did, as they introduced a new character and situation with such speed and little explanation, it felt like I had missed episode 7 without realizing I did.  \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 9 was total filler to just get us to the final episode, but it was absolutely hilarious, so it gets a pass.  But, Episode 10 was a problem.  Even though they had foreshadowed in earlier episodes what eventually made its way to the town in the final episode, when it arrived, it just felt so sudden and without any real build up.  It just felt like another event without much significance.  That's how the last episodes felt like.  Like a string of events without much significance, other than to introduce a new character.  \\n\\n\r\nStill, even though the pacing was severely flawed in the final three episodes, the humor and characters overrode that problem and made the show enjoyable to the end.  I'm looking forward to digging into season 2 right away.  I highly enjoyed the anime, and I think fans of the genre will enjoy it as well.  \\n\\n\r\nStory - 8\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 9\\n",

            "content": "so hi guys just gonna make another 'trying not to have spoilers' anime review. Actually i only do reviews for some animes and i just had to do one for konosuba. There are a few reasons why i like and do not like this anime. stay with me the gd part is abt to begin!\r\nSo firstly, why i like this anime: its totally amusing and so damn funny to watch! take my word for it it is. In these 10 episodes, never once has any part of the show failed to put a smile on my face, whether its the fanservice, the battle scenes, thefunny parts of the anime of course) even the reason as to why Kazuma died seemed to make me laugh more so than feel sad and sorry for him, as i think he is (was) at a better(?) place than where he was originally from. This anime, well i feel has certain extracts from other animes which in order to make this a non-spoiler anime review, i wont state which anime its like. There are some obvious clues though but ui will have to watch it to find out by yurself. \\n\r\nOops! I messed up ive said too much for the first point. Secondly why i like this anime, its a harem? For a harem lover like me, this anime was heavenly. The harem tag needed to be added as there was a harem indeed. The cover even shows it! ive seen harems from normal harems to monsters to reverse harems, u name it. This is one harem im sure to never forget. its so full of surprises! So for those of u who like harems, im sure u will find this anime heavenly just like i do. \\n\r\nThirdly, and this could be the point that is more personalized, its a game world, a real life RPG world?! who dosent love that? Ive played rpg games that are similar to this for a long time and this anime seemed to reenact the RPG world better than i expected than some other animes! I shall not go on abt it otherwise i will ruin yur fun if u are abt to watch it. \\n\r\nNow the bad points:\\n\r\nFirstly and something most of us can agree on, it has too little episodes! Too little! 10 is not enough for someone like me. Yes 12 is ok, 20+ is fine as well, of course more than that i wont watch the anime anymore as its too much. Yup too little. I need to see more, who kazuma will go with, more fanservice, more harem time, more adventures! More Chris san i mean more Megumin i mean more of all the characters! yea i'll go with that reason...\\n\r\nsecondly, Kazuma. He is by far, one of the less dense characters. However, he is too Mean. Too mean! Their are girls who well, have their own problems so maybe he should understand them a little more? But i guess he being mean to them sometimes can be a little funny... If thes too mean then it wont be funny anymore it just makes me feel sorry for the girls who have problems... Not saying the girls are totally like Heaven's angels. Like Aqua is definitely not an angel. Megumin is all right, darkness is well, Interesting. Interesting. \\n\r\nOverall this anime is gd despite the little bad points abt this anime as different personalities and a few mean characters at times can make things kinda amusing. So this anime to me is overall gd! 9/10. I mean it yea! So if u havent watched this anime and is reading the comments b4 watching the anime (just like me sometimes) look no more! Watch it! U wont regret it! :D\\n\r\np.s the girls are cute too ya know?? Cute girls make up a lotta reason to watch an anime right?? Of course theres plot and storyline, but i will be lying if i didnt state harems and cute girls as some part of the reason for me to watch this anime! Hope u will enjoy it as much as i do or u may even enjoy it more than me? haha have Fun then, till next time! :)",

            "content": "This is the first anime since Clannad to make me cry. Of course this time I was crying from laughing so hard. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys fantasy or comedy based anime.\r\nStory (8): The anime has a broad continuing story of \"to defeat the demon king\" but each episode usually revolves around 1 quest. The quest will usually involve a laughable struggle and a lame, lucky success (lame in their effort, but very enjoyable).\r\nArt (10) and Sound (9): The art, animation, and sound are all first rate\r\nCharacter (7): This is like a double edged sword, the characters are rather 1-dimensional (except forKazuma). However, each character is so polished in their dimension that its acceptable. Kazuma is a well-rounded character who has normal self-interested desires and reacts appropriately to his idiotic party and the unbalanced nature of the world.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10): This show is so funny I've cried and even woken my roommate from laughing so hard, and I tend not to like comedy driven animes. However, outside of comedy the show doesn't really shine, the fights aren't spectacular, but to me they are unpredictable; the characters grow as a party, but they stay trapped in their 1-dimension (and Kazuma only grows more frustrated not more developed).\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9): This show is hilarious and does a good job capturing the fantasy world while being unique. I was expecting a rehash of SAO and Log Horizon, but instead I got a comedy, fantasy, \"game\" anime that shines in its own light for its own reasons.",

            "content": "Konosuba is one of those shows that ends up being entertaining in spite of itself.  There have been quite a few shows where the protagonist ends up in an alternate reality fantasy world complete with a harem over the last few seasons and years.  Many of these shows are quite mediocre and rely quite heavily on harem tropes and fan service to try to carry the viewers through each episode.  Konosuba doesn't shy away from any of this, and by all that is good and true, should end up being just another poor to mediocre entry into the pile.\r\nYet... Konosuba stands asan interesting send up of the entire genre and becomes enjoyable regardless.  \\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling the story too much, the basic premise behind the show is that our main protagonist ends up getting \"killed\" and shipped off to a new life in a fantasy world with one special item/skill what have you facilitated by the goddess he meets after his untimely demise.  He decides, much to the goddess's chagrin, that he wants to take her along, and poof!  Off the two of them go to their new life in what essentially amounts to a more or less standard fantasy world.\\n\\n\r\nMany shows end up trying to make the main character overpowered and completely able to dominate their new world for... some reason or other, probably related to self-insert fantasies.  Konosuba becomes entertaining for the fact that it turns just about every expectation around on you.  \\n\\n\r\nThe main character is basically a terrible person and quickly finds that his dreams of being an all powerful demigod won't quite work out because by the statistical power rules of this strange new world, he's painfully average and can't take a powerful role that he wants.  He also quickly finds out that the goddess that he brings along with him is as terrible and self absorbed as he is and that she's not exactly helpful at all either.  The rest of the season is the two of them stumbling through the harsh realities of trying to make a living as adventurers..  \\n\\n\r\nKazuma, our main hero also collects a couple other misfits who don't really fit into standard heroic teams to round out his \"harem\" as well, including a send up of the all powerful chuuni mage archetype who boasts incredibly powerful magic!  That can only be used once... Not the most useful teammate.  They also collect a holy crusader character who is in theory incredibly powerful, yet only has usefulness as a meat shield who gets off on being beaten up and treated like a piece of meat often to the detriment of the tactical plan.  The rest of the show is basically these dysfunctional, selfish, downright idiotic personalities accepting quests from a job board Fairy Tail style and hilariously making Kazuma's life incredibly difficult.\\n\\n\r\nOn paper, Kazuma lives the ideal life of being a fantasy adventurer surrounded by attractive \"powerful\" adventurer classes, and many of his other acquaintances envy him... yet his life is a living hell of crazy situations.  That is the overarching schtick of this show that makes it work.\\n\\n\r\nThat, more than anything is why Konosuba is a surprisingly entertaining show to watch.  While the art is subpar a lot of the time, and the story is a bit ridiculous, Konosuba succeeds as an entertaining show because the characters interact in ways that just make things funny, even if the jokes are pretty repetitive at times.  There is a great sit-com vibe with the show and the voice actors seem to be having enough fun with this to carry things and make you want to watch these goofballs go out and sort of succeed at adventuring despite their sheer idiocy.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I cannot claim that this show has any great meaning to it, or does something incredible with the genre (really, the isekai genre isn't that great to begin with), or even that it relies way too heavily on its own memes to overcome its mediocre writing, it really was a fun journey through ten episodes. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, the measure of an anime stands on whether or not it entertains you, regardless of its other merits or lack there of.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Konosuba is not a great show, but it is an entertaining one.",

The animation is really great, although breast physics can be really weird, but i'm sure it's like that mostly for comical purposes.\\n\r\nAnother downside KonoSuba has is lack of episodes. Season 1 ended with only 10 episodes, which is a rare ocurrance on anime, and nobody seems to know why it ended so early. Despite ending so early, an OVA has been confirmed by this Fall season, and a second Season which date has yet to be confirmed.\\n\\n\r\nWhile it's not perfect, i highly recomend this anime if you want some nice laughs, as it's comedy is really great.",

            "content": "In the future, if I ever need to point out an example of characters being more important than story, I'm going to point at this show. \r\nSTORY (spoilers):\r\nThe story itself is nothing special, really, but it sets everything up wonderfully and has a few hilarious twists. A dude gets teleported to a fantasy world, where he finds instead of being a hero, he's forced to be a laborer and live the minimum wage fantasy life. Every time he saves the day, he still gets screwed over by the consequences of what he does. \r\nThat's my favorite part of the story. Real consequences. He saves histwo female party members from the insides of a frog, but they come out all slimy and the town mistakes him for a pervert, which leads to a perverted crusader seeking him out. The characters save the town by flooding the villain with a torrent of water, but they end up in debt because they destroyed the city wall. They save the day yet again, but the main character is arrested because he teleported the detonating power core right onto the governor's mansion. Nothing ever goes his way and I love it.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nThis is the sole reason you should watch this show. The characters are f*cking fantastic. Kazuma and gang are a beautiful subversion of every single harem anime out there.\\n\\n\r\nKazuma is the best main character in a long time. I haven't liked someone this much since Hachiman. He's deadpan, he's cynical, he's pragmatic, he insults the crap out of everybody, he's an amazing straight man in all the antics he's involved in, and he's basically just the subversion of all the infuriatingly bland MCs out there.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorite character moments for him is when he meets someone who's basically the MC of every other fantasy transportation anime out there. The other guy is annoyingly selfless to the point where people consider him narcissistic, and keeps trying to act how he believes is right. The other person challenges Kazuma to a duel due to a misunderstanding.\\n\\n\r\nJust as the other guy is finished with the challenge, Kazuma quickly says \"All right, I'm in.\" and charges right at him, catching the guy off guard. As soon as the other person tries to defend himself, he steals his magic sword and knocks him out with it. Then he goes to pawn it off to make a boatload of cash.\\n\\n\r\nKazuma isn't interested in morality or chivalry, he acts in the most pragmatic and logical ways possible. He isn't afraid to take advantage of other people's idiotic tendencies and use it against them. \\n\\n\r\nThere are tons of other character quirks I love. The way he says \"Yeah, I'm Kazuma\" or \"Hi, this is Kazuma\" when other people call is name out is a fantastic way of making fun of other animes where characters constantly call out the MCs name. He insults and berates his teammates to push their limits and get them to step up instead of some corny inspirational speech. He fully acknowledges his perverted thought, and eagerly cuts the bullshit to embrace opportunities with the other sex when he gets the chance (like a lot of normal high schoolers). \\n\\n\r\nImagine any other MC walking what amounts to a prostitution bar filled with skimpy succubi. They would probably get all flustered, apologize profusely for no fucking reason, and sprint out, right? Kazuma instead asks about possible legal ramifications for some requests that he's about to make to see how far he can push it. A girl barges into the bathroom as he's taking a bath, and his response is a leisurely \"yo\" with the best shit eating grin you'll ever see. This guy is great.\\n\\n\r\nHis chemistry and relationships with the other party members he has are also amazing. He sees himself as their caretaker, but he's pissed off at them for their horrible combat abilities and personality. He spends most episodes insulting the crap out of them, but it's still evident they all care for each other regardless because of how he keeps paying their tabs off.\\n\\n\r\nThey're basically like your college roommates. One's lazy and retarded, one 's weird, and the last one is into some really weird sh*t, but you all still hang out due to proximity. Eventually, you're all forced to like each other. That's the character dynamic we're talking about here.\\n\\n\r\nTheir relationships are never blatant either, which is f*cking incredible in the world of anime. There are no relationship scenes where they talk about their feelings/backstories and then blush a bunch (by the way, screw these scenes and their cringy dialogue), but their relationships still evolve before your eyes. \\n\\n\r\nYou get the feeling that Kazuma is kind of awkwardly sexually attracted to his party members, but there aren't zoom ins on his blushing face to REALLY MAKE SURE YOU GET THAT HE MAY HAVE A THING FOR THIS ONE. You get the feeling that the other girl might like him back, but there aren't any MEANINGFUL dialogue lines with a SHORT, BUT PROFOUND PAUSE FOLLOWED BY A GASP BY THE MAIN CHARACTER AS HIS DENSE MIND IS FINALLY PROCESSING WHAT SHE MIGHT BE IMPLYING.\\n\\n\r\nSorry, this is turning into a rant about how much I'm getting sick of all the stock harem anime out there. Which I am, by the way.This anime is a breath of fresh air.",

            "content": "//My first review. I hope you like it :) Try my best to give an honest opinion\r\n//won't spoil anything\r\n//i will be reviewing it based on story, art, sound, character, enjoyment and overall, as it is rated.\r\nSummary: Wow. How do i put this? It's awesome! To be honest guys, i never had expected it to be the sort of anime that it is. In 3 words, it's crazy, funny and enjoyable. If you like an all around funny yet relaxing anime, or better yet, if you just want good laugh, i say go for it! You won't regret it, trust me!\r\nStory: Konosuba is the type ofanime that is made purely for crazy laughs. There's not much in terms of story as that isn't the anime's selling point. If you're looking for a great plot line, there's always shows like re zero and akame, where a great plot makes the anime itself. This is not the case with Konosuba. The anime take a more relaxing and unique pace, mixed with a sense of comedy that is normally only found in school life animes. However, even with the absence of a good plot, the story itself does not feel boring nor does the comedic relief feel forced, unlike many anime nowadays, sadly. Every minute of it makes you want even more! xD\\n\\n\r\nArt: Konosuba's art style is quite good. It doesn't fall back on the times nor does it feel out of place. Its art style fits the fantasy genre perfectly, and allows the person watching it to feel at ease. The visuals itself aren't so striking that it hurts the eyes, nor does it feel bland. Konosuba knows exactly how to balance different art styles to fit the different moods (Fast paced mv, chibi characters).  Only reason i'm giving it 8 is because of the overusage of jelly facial expressions (i don't know what is it called ><). But still, the disgusted expressions is what makes Konosuba Konosuba!\\n\\n\r\nSound: Another factor that makes the show so great, is the sound and music. Konosuba pairs their osts to the cutscenes really really well. Prove of this is in the first episode itself. It doesn't feel out of place from the show or timing whatsoever. Even the character themes itself are a pleasure to listen to (i mean, just listen to megumin's one!). It's because of this good implementation of music and cutscene from the very 1st episode itself makes a heavy impression on the watcher. And it doesn't disappoint, even until the very last episode. The op theme is pleasing to listen to as well! (no spoilers but i really love the last episode soundtrack + mv)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Very rarely does an anime has a cast of characters where everyone is likeable and has a distinct unique personality. Every character in konosuba is distinctly different from one another, even the side characters. Yet, even with such differing personalities, none of them feel boring or even less than likeable. From the main characters, to villains, to side characters, you can't hate ANY of them! All of them are funny, crazy and lovable in their own way. Btw, megumin lovable char for the win!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 100% enjoyable. Not 1 minute of it feels boring. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Apart from the lack of story development, it really doesn't disappoint as a relaxing anime for casual watchers. All in all, i recommend it to anybody who enjoys casual, funny comedy animes.",

Is one of those anime.\r\nWho watches KonoSuba for the plot? Nobody, (unless you mean the PLOT, plot ;) )\r\nThe 'going to a new world trope has been recycled so much, nobody watches it for the plot.\r\nBasically, KonoSuba is so full of 'un-cliches' that those un-cliches become the cliches of the anime? Makes sense? KonoSuba is funny with its characters and situations and just how brutally, relatably, and realistic some of their problems are. Especially with studio Deen animating it, I was going to be in forquite a ride. Studio Deen's had some pretty strange animating moments (cough cough Higurashi) but it actually turned out for the better in KonoSuba with hilarious badly-drawn faces.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, just a good time for 10 episodes, I highly recommend the second season two, I wish they went more forward in the plot though. (Also I love the EDs of KonoSuba, so relaxing!)",

            "content": "Alright, so is this anime good? Yes. Is it worth a watch? Maybe, if you're looking for a quick, light-hearted pass time. Is this all it's hyped up to be? Weeeeellll... no. \r\nI'm not familiar with this kind of fantasy-parallel-universe genre since I don't really know many \"good\" anime that stems from it, so when people say this is supposed to be a parody of that genre, I have to admit, I really have no clue how accurate that statement is. So I guess some of the humor is lost on me, then. Lucky me.\r\nAs a comedy, this didn't really work for me. Not sureif it was just my sense of humor, but a lot of it felt like it was flat and bland. Not saying that it was terrible, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary, just the kind you typically find in anime. It seemed to fare much better with its longer punch lines and some of its running gags, though after some time, some of those got old quick. I will give the series some credit, since as it went along, it became much funnier and more entertaining, mostly because Darkness became more masochistic (okay, so I might have found that a little funny) and Kazuma became more and more done with everyone's shit. Kazuma cracked me up and probably was what made the show actually decent; he is my spirit animal, god bless his soul.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the actual plot... well, not much actually happens, but I don't think anyone was really expecting it to since it's a comedy. Which is kind of a bummer, because I really wanted to see them actually go on genuine adventures and defeat the Devil King and stuff. It gets a little boring when they're just doing the same things over and over again. Because - news flash - humor works just as well (if not better) if you actually spice things up a little. New settings are okay to use every once in a while - it won't detract from the fact that this is a parody (?) if you do it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty, but nothing special, especially for something made so recently. The character designs were pretty bland, especially for something supposedly set in a fantasy world, famous for its elaborate and creative character designs. Nope. None of that here.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was probably one of the high points of the anime. While the opening sounded like something out of Love Live (aka bland and overdone) and the ending was too quiet for my taste (though it was pretty peaceful, which I'll give it credit for), the voice actors and their line delivery was what made me laugh sometimes rather than the actual jokes. Kazuma's tone  when talking to the girls and Aqua's screams and wailing were absolutely perfectly done and quite hilarious, and the way the music swiftly switched on and off when something anticlimactic happened was entertaining, so kudos to the creators for that.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were (ugh, I'm going to get a lot of hate for this) overall really bland and boring. Actually, Kazuma was the most interesting, because he was the most relatable: \"Why am I here? What am I doing? This isn't the kind of fantasy world I imagined; I hate it.\" Darkness was probably the only girl I actually really liked, mostly because I kind of found her masochism amusing and her personality a little unique. Aqua was quite annoying, to say the least, and though I thought Megumin was cute, she was nothing special, as I've seen multiple characters just like her in the past. For a parody anime, it doesn't do too good of a job parodying tropes, now, does it?\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime... I guess. I mean, I watched the entire season, and I'm planning to watch the next (and the next, when that comes out) so I guess I found it entertaining? Strangely enough, it stands out a little among others of its like, so I guess that might be it. I think the best way to describe it is it's one of those stupid cat videos on Youtube that wastes your time and are absolutely ridiculous, and yet you just can't stop watching them. But in all honesty, this review was probably a little harsh purely because of the high expectations that everyone set for this anime (and my terrible sense of humor), so I guess it didn't really reflect my true feelings. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime isn't terrible, but it's not as mind-blowing as everyone says it is. It's good and it's cute, and if you want a few laughs or just something a little silly and slightly entertaining to watch, then give this a go. If you're expecting something like Gintama or Nichijou, then you should probably go find something else to watch instead, since this is nowhere near that level of comedy.",

Throughout the show there was rarely a time where I wasn't laughing my ass off.\r\nKonosuba though doesn't really have a strong story, or really one at all. Sure there is a big baddy set up, but it never goes anywhere. Konosuba instead takes the episode by episode route of telling a story, where almost each episode tells a different story than the last. In that aspect, the story is gold, the episodes plot-lines are all funny and there are great jokes spread throughout.\r\nI do have one issue with the show though and thatis with its treatment of the character Darkness. Darkness is kinda just thrown to the sidelines and never gets as much time spent to her as the others do, though this is just a small problem and doesn't detract from the enjoyment that I got out of the series.\\n\r\nAll said and done, Konosuba is an amazing comedy, with fantastic jokes, good characters and some damn good parodies of other big shows, I couldn't recommend it more.",

The whole thing is set up to be a classic \"MC is stuck in a fantasy world with a bunch of chicks who are into him\", but that's not the way it goes.\r\nHere's why it's not a harem:\r\nFirst, the MC is just a regular otaku, who, when placed in a fantasy world is... shockingly underpowered. Basically, the only stat going for him is luck, which ends up playing only a minor role in the rest of the story.\r\nSecond, the girls in his group are all weirdand quarky, and none of them particularly want to get involved with him.\\n\\n\r\nThird, there's no real villain they're trying to defeat.

            "content": "When writing this review, I asked myself: why did I rate Konosuba so highly?  Was it because it did something new?  Was it because it made me look at an old thing in a new light?  No.  The answer isn't something so complicated as that.  Why is Konosuba a masterpiece?  It made me laugh.\r\nKonosuba is, when all the trappings and bells and whistles are taken away, a comedy.  What does a good comedy do?  It makes the viewer laugh.  A great one?  Peals of laughter.  A Konosuba one?  Gasping for air and needingto pause while waiting for your seizure to stop.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nThe basic idea has already been done time and time again.  Isekai is nothing new.  Getting game-breaking weapons is nothing new.  But Konosuba takes all that and throws it out the window.  The MC, Kazuma, dies a hilarious death and winds up in a sort of purgatory in front of the goddess Aqua.  She throws him a bunch of very OP weapons and abilities and tells him to choose from the lot, all the while poking fun at his laughable death.  Understandably pissed off, Kazuma decides to pick her instead of the weapons, and their wild adventure begins!  Naturally, there is a plot, but it isn't so much a plot as it is a bunch of loosely connected episodes.  While Kazuma and his gang do level up and gain more powers and abilities, the whole adventure winds up being not so much an MC and his gang lvl up and proceed to beat the snot out of the end boss so much as it is a slice of life with fantasy elements.  In fact, the first episode does a marvelous job of depicting the flow of time as Kazuma and Aqua perform their jobs as adventurers by building houses and completing no quests at all.  Episode 2 sees the start of their adventuring, but hilarity ensues as they complete their kill quest in not quite the manner they envisioned it, particularly from Aqua's viewpoint; she certainly didn't think she'd be used as bait.  Ep 2 also sees the introduction of the 3rd member of our cast, Megumin.  Although she seems, and is, weird from having a chuunibyou name and personality, she quickly absolves their worries after demonstrating her very real and very deadly EXPLOSION (cue collapse from awe).  Ep 3 introduces us to our final cast member: Darkness.  A masochistic crusader, she demonstrates her value to Kazuma's party by allowing flying vegetables to strip her of her armor, all in front of ogling men (who're staring for entirely different reasons).\\n\\n\r\nAfter getting us introduced to the four main cast members, we find that they proceed to, aside from one or two notable deeds, do absolutely nothing, all while comfortably vegetating in the starting town.  While they do nothing, how they do it is priceless.  Which leads us to the next criterion:\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Konosuba/10\\n\r\nIn any story, whether it be a book, an anime, or a movie, the characters will make or break the narrative.  This is even more apparent in slice-of-life anime, since it really just follows the characters as they do their daily, often boring, business.  Thus, the individual characters and their chemistry are especially important; Konosuba does not disappoint.  In order of first appearance in the anime, we have:\\n\\n\r\nKazuma-\\n\r\nYour typical MC protagonist, except he's not.  While he fits the NEET archetype, he fills in other archetypes as well, such as the pervert, the asshole, and the, surprisingly useful, hero.  Throughout the series, we see Kazuma grow both in levels and as a person.  While he still is a hikikomori by the end of the series, he's gone from (hasn't talked to a girl in his life, stays at home playing games) to (talked to N+1 girls, stolen panties off of girls N+1 times, saved the town multiple times by accident and by design, and most importantly, gotten better at dealing with people, specifically, his 3 problem children).  He has grown from a self-centered pervert to someone who, while still selfish and perverted, better understands how to deal with people in interactions ranging from idle chit-chat to business transactions.  This is probably thanks to his trial by fire known as, in no particular order (AquaMeguminDarkness).  He's also gotten a variety of skills that allow him to better deal with enemies.\\n\\n\r\nAqua-\\n\r\nThe typical perfect bishoujo (she's a goddess for crying out loud), save this one's a bitch instead of an ice queen, and as Kazuma finds to his great dismay, completely and utterly useless.  She introduces herself to Kazuma by proclaiming that she's a goddess before openly laughing at his death (though let's face it, we would too).  After getting dragged to the fantasy world, her first act is to bawl like a baby.  Her tantrum is then catapulted into the spotlight since the episode puts her wailing on pause (it's like even the director got sick of her), before allowing her tears to run their inevitable course.  The first episode does a marvelous job of highlighting her bitchy antics without making the viewer outright hate her.  The later episodes expand on her character, and by the end of the series, though she's still clumsy and a bitch, she's become slightly better mannered and more competent combat wise (cue classic breaking of shield of end boss).  We, and Kazuma, grow to like this girl (just a little bit though)\\n\\n\r\nMegumin-\\n\r\nWhat happens when you take 8th grade syndrome and make it real?  You get the meme known as Megumin.  While her chunni antics are decidedly weird, and at times, outright perverted, she is very powerful, as demonstrated by her EXPLOSION, first witnessed in ep 2.  Just like her trademark attack, she is very flashy and very red.  She's smart too, as she coerced Kazuma into letting her join his party despite the latter trying, not so subtly, to eject her.  For the first half of the season, she mainly serves as the fireworks of the gang, or in this case, causing an OP boss to attack them before they were properly prepared.  The latter half of the season sees Megumin use a better EXPLOSION, but there's not too much personal growth.\\n\\n\r\nDarkness-\\n\r\nWhat do crusaders do?  They protect people.  Now let's dial it up past MAX and throw away the sword.  The end result is the running gag known as Darkness.  Probably the most one-dimensional character of the series, Darkness nonetheless provides excellent fun and demonstrates the delight of taking a concept and turning it up to 11.  Her gag is the foil to the folly the other 3 characters invariably encounter.  Perhaps inevitably, she doesn't experience any notable growth; that's saved for season 2.\\n\\n\r\nNow the chemistry:\\n\r\nKazuma is, not too surprisingly, the most level headed of the gang.  He provides a source of stability whenever the others get too out of hand, though if they really decide to go all out, he's dragged along for the ride.  He provides a relatable viewpoint, whether through his deadpan humor and snide remarks or through his not so exaggerated reactions (some'll still be exaggerated to the moon and back).  Aqua is the foil he plays off of.  She's pretty much the opposite of everything Kazuma is.  One is decent with money; the other is spenderific.  One is somewhat able to analyze the situation; the other has no clue at all.  One manages not to set off any traps; the other sets off all the traps and attracts traps outside the dungeon!  In other words, one is the boke and the other is the tsukkomi.  The fantasy world setting frees the characters to do pretty much whatever they want cuz in the end, it's all magic.  This allows Konosuba to dial all the antics up to 11.  Then we have Megumin. \\n\r\n She's another boke, but unlike most boke, she's actually smart and able to read the situation.  From taking advantage of whispered rumors to force her way into Kazuma's party to coordinating with Kazuma as a team to fight the midboss, she actually contributes to the team's fighting strength.  Ofc, the only reason they had to fight the midboss in the first place was because she made it mad.  Then we get Darkness.  As Aqua was Kazuma's foil, Darkness is the foil of the other 3.  Her masochistic desires make light of what could've otherwise been a relatively serious situation.  Her longing to be covered in slime or get blasted with fire light up an otherwise dark encounter.  While we all know that the main 4 are going to get away unscathed (?), Darkness's unrequited desires provide a comfortable denouement to the climaxes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\n1. The action scenes (fights, giant laser beams, EXPLOSION, tantrums) were gorgeous\\n\r\n2. The vibrant colors and varied outfits of the cast members were pleasing to the eye; the secondary characters had outfits no less varied\\n\r\n3. If it takes 1 hour to draw one scene and there are 12 scenes per second, how long would it take for one person to animate an entire episode?\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nOP and ED were pleasing.  The OP especially synced exquisitely with the animation.  It's like a story within a story.  The other sounds, tones, and music within Konosuba did well in highlighting the antics of the gang or helping tone down the mood.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: ???/10\\n\r\nIn the end, Konosuba is, at it's core, a slice-of-life comedy in a fantasy world.  As I noted at the beginning of my review, it caused me to laugh so hard I needed to press pause.  Need I say more?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5x/10 (9.6x?)\\n\r\nKonosuba is a wonderful departure from the standard isekai genre.  It starts out with fittingly 1D characters before slowly fleshing them out through, delightfully, everyday occurrences (if you can call monsters an everyday occurrence).  Admittedly, as this is comedy at it's core, the gags and jokes are not for everyone.  Some people prefer deadpan humor, some like sitcoms.  I like sitcoms.  I like manzai.  Konosuba is an excellent sitcom.  It is an excellent manzai.  The fantasy setting allows Konosuba to create wild situations that would otherwise break our suspension of disbelief, and the characters themselves provide relatable viewpoints and mood lighteners.  All in all, Konosuba is comedy platinum.\\n\\n\r\nP.S.\\n\r\nLast episode has a hilarious twist at the end, setting up a natural segue into season 2!",

            "content": "Ahhh Konosuba, an anime that many people like myself went in with little to no expectations (doesn't help when it's by DEEN). And oh boy what a surprise it was.\r\nStory (7/10):\r\nAbout Konosuba's story, there wasn't really one. Many have come to expect a MMORPG setting with similar stories and tones like SAO, Log Horizon, Overlord, Danmachi etc. However, Konosuba is more of a SOL parody with the MMORPG setting with more focus on the comedy aspect. The story is being told in an episodic manner with the group dealing with MMORPG issues like recruitment, money management and of course the quests. Except being a parody,they are not your typical MMORPG issues you would expect, and for the better good from a comedic standpoint. That said, despite me liking the SOL parody setting and the comedy, the story is not one of its main selling points.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10): \\n\\n\r\nStudio DEEN is notorious for having terrible art and animation. Hence, expectations were not high going into this anime. Luckily they stepped it up this season. The art style isn't noticeably special, but appealing to a relaxing, comfy and funny anime like Konosuba. The explosions by Megumin however look neat. The animation is decently fluid, although there isn't a huge amount of movements. The brighter colors are also a plus as it fits the lighter tones of the show. The character designs are decent, not bizarre but also not lazy with some details on their outfits. One important thing to note is how freaking silly their reaction faces are, in a good way. Overall, I have little complains regarding the art and animation as a whole, despite some questionable shots. At least DEEN didn't pull a...DEEN. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors suits the characters as you would expect from looking at the character designs. The voices are still great considering some of them aren't even that experienced as a voice actor. The background music fits the story and atmosphere well albeit not amazing. There are no noticeable tracks that really captured my attention which is slightly disappointing considering the music composer is known for his works in the Monster Hunter series.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs on the other hand, are excellent. The opening is upbeat and cheerful which perfectly matches the tone of the show. However, what I really want to talk about is the ending theme. I might be bias as I love theme songs which are sung by the voice actors of the MCs, but the ending theme is stupendous. It is really comfy and relaxing and surprisingly fits the show well. It gives off a homey feel after a crazy absurd episode of Konosuba. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are by far the main reason why this show is good. I'm going to first talk about the main cast, Satou, Megumin, Aqua and Darkness. In terms of their power level, they have huge flaws but huge strengths. Like being able to tank tons of damage but unable to land a single hit. The show makes uses of said flaws and strength for comedic purposes and it is executed well. For their personalities, the male MC, is by far one of the best MCs for a show like this. He is a dick, in a good way. He is straightforward and not afraid to call out the stupid things the girls in the group are doing and trolls people for his own enjoyment. At the end of the day however, he still meant well for the girls and can be sensible at times. The personalities of the girls are pleasantly surprising for their designs, which of course adds to the humor of the show. They are not normal, and being out of the norm is what a show like this needs. Some might argue that the group gets too close and bond to each other way too fast, but I feel that it is perfectly fine due to episode restrictions. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are not that interesting and are forgettable which is not a big problem considering the little impact they have on the show. The villains, well, there aren't really any villains. Other than monsters they fight, the 'villains' are just annoying to the main cast and nothing more.  Overall, despite the main cast having barely any character development, it is not necessary for a show like Konosuba, where people like me just watch the show for the characters usual antics. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy of this anime is simply fantastic. And is something I really look forward to every week for my weekly laughs after a long day of school. I love comedy anime and in fact more than half of all the anime I've watched has comedy in them, be it main or subplot. Konosuba takes the title of one of the very few anime that made me laughed out loud.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10):\\n\\n\r\nFor me, Konosuba is without a doubt the 2nd best anime of Winter 2016, closely behind ERASED. And that is saying something considering the great story, characters and cinematography ERASED has. \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys comedy and have watched at least 1 or 2 of those MMORPG anime. Comedy is however, subjective, so unfortunately the anime might be a hit or miss. \\n\\n\r\nWith that said, you can definitely count on Konosuba to ruin an emotional or epic scene with something ridiculous.\\n\\n",

I thought it was going to be another \"trapped in a fantasy world\" but guys, how much i was wrong! Before starting to analyze other aspects i have to say this is anime is all a PARODY: flying cabbages, water tricks, soccer with heads and more will make the viewer ask him/herself \"what the hell i am watching?\" but if you actually enjoy a good comedy look no farther.\r\nStory - 8\r\nThe plot itself is the \"weak point\" for me because being a comedy/parody it's pretty much about giving troublesto our party members but HOW those events are developed make it totally very nice to see. Furthermore a special notice goes to how Kazuma (the main character) grows: he learns more skill going on and use them in a very ingenious way making the story even interesting making you think \"how will he use his skill now to solve the problem?\"\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 9\\n\r\nAbsolutly the best point. The members of the \"main party\" are well characterized and at a certain point of the show you'll think you almost know them for real(VA really did a good job with acting)! Kazuma itself it's one of the best character i have ever seen being able to break many cliche (ex:\" don't drink too much or the spell will not work\"-he will not drink at all). The sub characters are not well made as the main group but they are there for making you laugh and trust me, they will.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nWhile the characters may be your \"standard characters\" the animation of spells is really amazing!! It deserves at least 9!( EXPLOSION!) But well i can't rate only relying on spells...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nThis is actually subjective but i really liked it a lot. Never got bored, not a single time. Some jokes may be repetitive but never fall on the boring type (\"Yes, i am Kazuma\" while people start saying bullshits it's always gold)\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\r\nAnd here we are again. It's a fantasy parody for everyone (well the ep 9 is a bit too ecchi, so not really for every kind of audience..): a good plot, crazy characters with a one sane man makes jokes awesome and with a good touch of nice-to-watch skills.\\n\r\nIf you like this kind of show you have to give it a try!\\n\\n\r\nKeyword: STEAL!

            "content": "Kono Subarashii brings a different kind of humor than the rest of the comedic anime shows. They know what to do and when to do it, it isn't your cut and paste comedy from a billion other shows, and that's what makes this show great!\r\nI'm gonna tell you right now, no matter what you read from the synopsis (i actually haven't read it lol) this show does not go anywhere, but that's understandable. The goal of this show wasn't to be a shounen with the end plot of beating \"the demon king.\" At least it doesn't seem like that, I mean come on, in thevery first episode the people literally say \"oh yeah the demon king's influence isn't anywhere near here,\" which should show people that \"okay, so this whole demon king shit is never going to be happening then.\" \\n\\n\r\nBut this show does a really nice job of keeping up the same tempo through out the entire show, but still managing to alter a few factors to make it fresh and enjoyable. A lot of shows, even stemming away from anime for a bit, have a huge problem of shifting focus in the story. For example, a comedy can turn into a shounen real quick, and unless done in sequence with the flow of the story, like Madoka Magica holy shit that transition from ep 3 to 4 was so UNGH, then you're gonna have a pretty shit show. But this show does the exact opposite, which was a good thing, it kept the same pace throughout the entire show. And although you aren't able to see them \"defeat the demon king,\" you do see some very slight progressions that make it a little more enjoyable, like for example *on episode 8* \"oh hey cool i didn't know such and such character got to this level.\"  \\n\\n\r\nSo don't be expecting any deep plot, or intense action, or an adventurous goal, just expect a light hearted, care-free, comedic show. It does a great job of setting the stage up, with its different perspective of \"being put into an rpg (as in a different perspective of SAO Overlord etc),\" and makes you grasp and enjoy where this show is going. All-in-All, it's a nice show, don't miss out on it. \\n",

            "content": "Upon first encountering Konosuba, one could easily write it off as a waste of time, something that doesn't allow its audience to dive deeper and get more involved. I would disagree. Lack of depth isn't something an anime should be criticized for. This anime had a refreshing sort of air to it, which made it actually very endearing and entertaining. The story was its only weak point, as there wasn't a traditional plot, just a series of adorable little quests, but even this wasn't much of a setback. Konosuba is't amazing, but it certainly does a good job of entertaining you throughout the course ofthe series. It isn't anything to get really into, it's just generally entertaining and is short enough in length and disjointed enough in plot to be very convenient for the audience. Konosuba's art seems average for modern anime, but I still appreciate their colorful and somewhat detailed designs. The soundtrack wasn't flawed in any way, but wasn't particularly impacting. Still, it suited the anime perfectly with its light tones. I specifically enjoyed the opening and ending to the track, as they were the most noticeable to me. The characters were adorable. A goddess tricked out of heaven, an otaku who got reincarnated as a hero, a pyromaniac witch, and a hilariously perverted and masochistic knight. Even the minor characters were priceless, like the wise old adventurer who gets seen at the succubus brothel. Still, there wasn't much character development and many of them seemed to be portrayed in an overly lewd manner. This wasn't too bothersome, but it didn't help that the characters had very little impact on me outside of humor. Overall, I truly enjoyed this anime. It's a great anime to watch when you've had a rough day and just want something to watch that won't make you angry, sad, or worried. It's just pure, lighthearted D&D questing, with goofy characters and simple punchlines. Not an anime I would recommend skipping.",

            "content": "KO NO SU BA!\r\nI read the synopsis before watching and well, i definitely did not expect this take on your classic sent-to-another-world-and-beat-the demon-leader story. One would normally think the MC would be on his way to becoming a hero but having useless stats except luck, and joined by promising adventurers who turn out to be useless, his adventure in another world could never be more wrong! Filled with comedy and mayhem, this parody of a show takes you on a ride of excitement and joy.\r\nStory: 7\r\nSatou Kazuma decided to make his useless life at least somewhat hopeful by sacrificing himself to save a girl. Dieda happy death, he was brought to life in the 'god' realm by Aqua and found out that he died a death that was useless... And a really pathetic one that brought me laughing to tears XD I'm very sorry Kazuma. And so, Aqua offered Kazuma a second life in another world that needs help in fighting off the bad guys. Having the option of bringing just one thing, whether the most overpowered ability or weapon, Kazuma (and this is where the fun starts) brought Aqua that mocked and annoyed him so much. Yes she mocked HAHA. Kazuma having the worst stats an adventurer could have except exceptional luck (yes that useless stat, or so you might think ;) ) is forced to team up with Aqua, and is joined by Megumin and Darkness, who have exceptional stats and classes. Little does he know that those three are utterly useless leaving Kazuma facepalmed. Met with quests that are stupid, or outrageous or pathetic, Kazuma and gang fight to complete them with REALLY INTERESTING METHODS.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art is pretty bright and really clean. The facial and bodily expressions helps bring out the fun and comedy in the characters' flaming each other *oops i meant character interactions*.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nThe sound is okay. The OP is fun, the ED is light-hearted. The OST doesnt really leave a lasting impression. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nYou have your smart MC but with a useless class and stats. There's also the goddess Aqua, the chuuni Megumin and freaking masochistic Darkness OH GOSH I LOVE HER. Blessed with exceptional stats and classes, they can never get anymore useful.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nTHIS. IS WHERE KONO SUBA EXCELS AT.\\n\r\nKazuma joined with his fellow useless members tries to complete quests that are all pathetic, outrageous or supposedly downright impossible. AND BOY DO THEY COMPLETE THEM IN SUCH STYLE AND LAUGHTER. Filled with backstabs and flaming, never have quests been so comical. The ever-so-useful Aqua, the really masochistic Darkness who cant hit a single strike and the chuuni Megumin who can land such a one-time powerful explosion and only that. Accompanied by Kazuma who is ever so flameful with his remarks, they turn out to be quite the good team.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nI looked forward every week to the release of each new episode. It was a really fun experience and definitely do not back away from this show. And with Konosuba season 2 confirmed, lets watch the show and get ready for more... EXPLOSIONS! by Megumin :) Season 2 hype!",

            "content": "First I gotta say, I didn't actually didn't expect much from this series. My first thought from reading the summary of this anime was \"I've already seen this a dozen times before, do we really need another one?\" The \"NEET gets sent into the world of their dreams, a fantasy world or a world of games or game-like logic\" is everywhere in anime and really comes off as a lack in originality. Off the top of my head I can immediately think of Sword Art Online, No Game No Life, maybe Zero No Tsukaima. It would assume it would be a clone of those, orthat it would be a trashy harem anime, judging by the female-male ratio of the main characters. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I wasn't entirely wrong, I was far from correct in assuming that. \\n\\n\r\nThis definitely is a series that's for comedy rather than self-insert fantasies. Subtract the sense of a grand adventure, add much more humor, and keep the occasional action but accentuate those with by the lovable characters, and you have KonoSuba. The story is far from original and doesn't really have much weight overall in the series, but as I covered above, that's not really the point of the series either. It mostly there to serve as part of the setting for the characters and individual situations in each episode than as an integral part of the show. I'm not sure how I can get the idea across to someone who hasn't seen it, but something even just struck me as somewhat \"slice-of-life\" or western about its format. The story progression is much less apparent, although it's still there, and each episode I was wondering \"Oh boy, what type of adventure will they have today? What antics will our main characters get into?\" rather than \"How will their adventure progress as a whole? What will happen next\". \\n\\n\r\nSome choices in the animation were questionable and reused animation was noticeable in the few situations it showed up in, so honestly the art was pretty \"standard\" most of the time, but at the same time it was always pleasant to look at and I always liked the design of the various characters and creatures that the protagonists come across.\\n\\n\r\nFor me overall it's an 8/10. It isn't a perfect work of art, but I thought it was hilarious and I eagerly waited for each episode to come out. If you're wondering whether this series is for you, I suggest at least watching the first two episodes.",

            "content": "Fantasy series that involved, in one way or another, a protagonist from our world who struggles in a, well, fantasy universe tends to signal a warning light in my head. Even more so when said fantasy universe was deeply inspired by MMO mechanic. Stories of such nature, while not only has been prevalent in the industry in this post-SAO world, is something that I don't associate with good-storytelling. There has been some exceptions, like last year decent-but-not-too-remarkable Danmachi and this season slice-of-life focused MMO anime Grimgar. But on the whole, I remained skeptical in a story with this sort-of premise.\r\nKono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo!,or Konosuba, however, thankfully rebuked my earlier expectation that it's going to be another bland entry to the fantasy-mmo genre. And while it's comedic-centric conceit is a fresh of breath air, unfortunately, I can't say that it's a particularly noteworthy entry either.\\n\\n\r\nThe series main strength is arguably it's enjoyable cast of characters. From the first scene in which two of our protagonist, Kazuma and Aqua, met, the series manage to illustrate and establish an entertaining dynamic between the two. Aqua is a proud, self-important, arrogant cock who relish her status as a goddess, something that made her often the butt off much of the series joke because her status almost didn't help her surviving in the fantasy world, who pretty much run in contrast with snarky, face-palming Kazuma. Joining the two are Megumin who act much like our world chuunibyo, which made it funny because she's an actual demon who can do actual magic (which she also can only use once a day), and, my least favorite, Darkness. A crusader who's useless when it comes to the offense and took pleasure in running into abusive circumstances. Even if the series humor doesn't always hit the mark (and it frequently does for me, something that I'll get into later on), it still manage to provide a constant light-hearted, comfy atmosphere because the main cast of Konosuba are the sort of people you'd enjoy spending times with and you emotionally invested in, even if the two of the leads are technically an ass.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I also somewhat appreciate is the fact that the series prevented itself from being just a string of ludicrous situation after another by giving a steady narrative progression, although unfortunately it's not on the character side of things since, apart from some few background info regarding each of the leads, their personality and dynamic largely remain the same throughout the season. Kazuma steadily gain fortune and new skills, he and his party eventually managed to move out from a horse stable, and even beat a dark general later on.\\n\\n\r\nBut even with entertaining leads, it's a shame that the much of the series humor fell flat. Humor is often reliant of setting up a scenario in order to create a sort of expectation from the audience, only to deliver a punchline by subverting those expectation, either through unexpected, but still plausible, character reaction or another unknown variable. The joke in Konosuba became predictable all to quickly because it often follow more or less the same pattern. Darkness will act perverted in dangerous situation, Aqua's arrogance will backfire against her, Megumin will be all to eager to unleash her magic which pretty much cause her to collapse, and Kazuma will comment about how stupid it all was. Combine that with some tasteless ecchi jokes (about half of them are courtesy of Darkness), the experience of watching Konosuba is often a pleasant one, rather than actually funny or hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nKonosuba does try to balance this by continuously setting up absurd and inventive scenario that based on quest you'd often see in an MMO game. And while several of these scenario is funny in concept, like the battle against the Dullahan which is a nice mix of tension and humor, and the ghost mansion episode which alternate between two \"scary\" scenario, one is the ghost themselves and the fact that Kazuma and Megumin really needs to go to the bathroom, the characters still more or less reacted the same way as I've stated above.  \\n\\n\r\nOn aesthetic side of things, I'm not sure there's much too say apart from the fact that it's generally serviceable, with some few derpy expressions. The character design are appealing, but not particularly distinctive. The series does have a few quirky animation that elevate the series joke. \\n\\n\r\nSo on the whole, while it failed to live up the comedic potential set up in the introduction episodes, Konosuba is a enjoyable experience that I don't regret watching. Like I said, it's comedic focus is somewhat fresh in the fantasy-mmo crowd. I wouldn't mind watching the second season when it comes out.",

            "content": "Ladies and gentlemen, this is a fantastic example of how you do a parody anime.\r\nKono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo (usually shortened as KonoSuba) is a light novel series by Natsume Akatsuki that parodies the \"trapped in another world\" type of stories you're probably well familiarized with such as Sword Art Online and No Game No Life. Instead of our protagonist exploring this new world, forming a competent party and becoming a certified badass his new life instead turns out the to be the opposite of what he intended for: he starts out with nothing, is partnered with a useless companion and the rest ofhis party are absolutely incompetent at what they specialize in; and it's hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nKazuma Satou a high school NEET dies in an accident (the circumstances behind it are hilarious) and is brought to the afterlife and is given a choice by a goddess by the name of Aqua: go to heaven, or get sent to a another world to defeat the Demon King. Naturally as a gamer he ends up choosing the choice to be reborn in a fantasy world and somehow ends up dragging Aqua along with him. Now he must live in this new world along with Aqua, form a party and go on adventures with the end goal of defeating the Demon King.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't too much of a story after that and the setting isn't anything new, but hey; it works.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art has much to be desired. However, Studio Deen's art and animation surprisingly fit this type of show surprisingly well! In my opinion it greatly adds to the humour of the story as it goes well with the slapstick style of humour the show relies on. The character designs look great and are very appealing, especially Megumin's!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs are great and fit the mood of the show well. At first I had problems with Kazuma's voice but as the show progressed I got used to it and now think it fits him absolutely wonderful because of how often he is a deadpan snarker! The other voices fit the other characters well, Darkness and Megumin's voice actors stand out to me because their antics are what elicits a laugh from me the most.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nProbably my favourite aspect of KonoSuba, although I won't go into too much details on it because I find it more fun to find out on your own how actually messed up each member of Kazuma's party is.\\n\\n\r\nWe of course have Kazuma Satou a NEET who is reborn into a fantasy world and chooses the Adventurer class. This guy plays the straight man to his party's antics and is one of better MC's I have ever seen for straying away from what you'd expect out of the main character in an fantasy world.\\n\r\nAqua is a goddess who despite actually acting high and mighty is actually rather stupid and becomes reliant on Kazuma more than she admits when they are transported to another world. She chooses the Arch Priest class and often gets on Kazuma's nerves.\\n\r\nMegumin is a chuunibyou like Arch Wizard who specializes in only Explosion magic.\\n\r\nDarkness is a masochistic Crusader who enjoys tanking all the damage for the team.\\n\\n\r\nThese characters and their antics will make you laugh; guaranteed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nIt's very refreshing! This show absolutely love throwing RPG tropes and cliches at you and then totally destroying them. This show is THE comedy of the Winter 2016 season because every episode is bound to get some laughs out of you one way or another.\\n\r\nI can't wait for season 2!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nEver wonder what SAO would be like if Kirito wasn't an OP badass and instead was a deadpan snarker while everyone around around him is hilariously incompetent at what they specialize? Watch this show. This is not your average \"trapped in another world\" anime based on a light novel. This is a parody of how our MC's like Kirito will usually become a competent adventurer, gain the affection of many women and accomplish his mission successfully.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: KonoSuba is a fantastic parody of \"trapped in another world\" and fantasy RPG stories in general. The humour is great and the characters are very likeable and hilarious. KonoSuba will hilariously break many of the standard tropes you will come to expect out most Fantasy anime out there.",

You have the main character, Kazuma, who is just immediately likeable and in the first 5 minutes you are shown how unlucky he is.

Although I would find this annoying it's Kazuma who I love in these situations as he plays off it, he's a smart character. Then we are introduced to Megumin who is a mage who controls the power of explosive magic, however she is absolutely useless. Then comes Darkness who is a paladin knight who loves being used as a shield.... that's right she is a paladin who loves being hit. Oh but no it doesn't stop there, despite being a pervert she also can't hit anything with her sword. \\n\\n\r\nI swear Kazuma has just got the worst luck but how he plays everything off for very comedic timings and effects is just perfect.

            "content": "While looking through the lineup of Winter 2016 anime, I came across a title that struck out a bit more than the others, Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo! It didn\u2019t strike out because of it\u2019s originality or innovative description, but because it looked so awfully generic that it just seemed downright offensive, to me at least. Just from the cover art alone, I assumed the series was just gonna be another otaku-transported-to-another-world-with-a-harem anime with some pandering to the otaku audience that soaks in all those light novel adaptions, animated by Deen this time around.\r\nNonetheless, I still reluctantly tried out Konosuba (as I will callit from now on). So, was I right about Konosuba? Look, my rating tells you otherwise. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong about Konosuba. It was one the best of comedies I\u2019ve ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Narrative -  Konosuba is not a serious show. Konosuba knows this, and it uses this to its benefit to become enjoyable. Right from the get go, we get to know Konosuba\u2019s style. It\u2019s a light, slapstick, self-parodying, raw comedy. \\n\\n\r\nIn the first episode, our beloved otaku MC dies from a panic attack of possibly getting hit by a car. Oh, and he also pissed his pants afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, MC-kun, Kazuma, gets transported to the afterlife in where he meets an arrogant goddess who really gets on Kazuma's nerves. Said goddess, Aqua, tells Kazuma that he can get transported to a fantasy world in which he has to defeat a supposed demon king, your typical fantasy set up. Kazuma agrees but on certain conditions. Kazuma tells Aqua that she has to go along with him, to which Aqua whines in return saying that said action is impossible as the rules of the afterlife world work against her transporting her with Kazuma. Kazuma and Aqua, along with their future comrades, must now fight the demon king of their new fantasy world. Oh, but they\u2019re weak and piss-poor, so they aren\u2019t gonna be able to do said thing in a while.\\n\\n\r\nKonosuba could have just been another fantasy anime with a quirky setup, but no, it had to be something different, and I mean that in a good way. By the end of the introductory episode and the later episodes that follow it,  it is clear that Konosuba is a comedy. A comedy that parodies the fantasy genre. And it\u2019s a damn good one at that. Konosuba pokes at fantasy and light novel tropes, harem antics, and anime in general. Action scenes are anticlimactic. Our protagonists are absolutely terrible at what they do. Pacing is slow because of its episodic nature. All of this wouldn\u2019t efficiently work in a serious show, but it does in a comedy like Konosuba, and Konosuba knows it and doesn\u2019t ever try to be what it\u2019s parodying in a serious manner, or turning into something it's not.\\n\\n\r\nKonosuba could have just established itself as a parody of the fantasy genre, and it would be fine, it would have been great, but Konosuba takes a step further by actually excelling as just a general comedy. Sure, pre-established knowledge from the viewer would make the show more enjoyable, but Konosuba would still manage to deliver the punches to them. A majority of Konosuba\u2019s comedy is character-based, usually revolving around characters reacting to certain situations created by the world around them, or by themselves. However, Konosuba doesn\u2019t just shove jokes down your throat telling you to laugh at them. Konosuba develops its jokes enough for the punchlines to really be punchlines. Dialogue doesn\u2019t just come out of a character to make a \u201cforced joke\u201d from their singular archetype. Subtlety is there, whether it be on the characters or set up around them. Even when Konosuba does pull its punches, it still managed to give at least me a sincere smile by having characters have a natural flow of conversation that isn\u2019t necessarily meant to have you laugh as much as it\u2019s main gags. The only thing I have a gripe on, and it\u2019s a really minor and forgivable one, is that the gags don\u2019t have some multiple layers of narrative to them (See: Gintama), or, at least, don\u2019t seem to have. But, hey, comedies are meant to be enjoyed as something you can turn off your mind to, and Konosuba doesn\u2019t get any complaints from me in that aspect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- I  mentioned that Konosuba as a character-driven comedy in those last few lines. That alone would make it a good comedy, albeit not an excellent one. Character comedies have to have interesting, likable, relatable characters that we can look into and laugh, not because they\u2019re laughing or because what\u2019s going around them is intentionally absurd, but because their reactions come off as genuine. And Konosuba does a great job with this by not just having characters be based on a single character type and laughing off at them because they\u2019re \u2018awkward\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nKazuma, our MC-kun, serves as the straight man in a series where he\u2019s surrounded by idiots, as he calls them. Kazuma\u2019s reactions to the rest of his team are cynical, usually responding in annoyed fashions, typical of the archetype he\u2019s based on. Kazuma takes a step further from this archetype, though. Kazuma occasionally comes off as an actually fun guy who takes things actually takes leisurely, sometimes even contributing to some of the stupidities his cast makes. For instance, Kazuma is the backbone of many of the series\u2019s best gags, at least for me. And Kazuma's transitions in mood aren\u2019t paced awfully quickly in which they seem so out of character, it just seems natural, as I\u2019ve said before. Kazuma easily ranked up there in some of my favorite male characters.\\n\\n\r\nKazuma\u2019s harem, which thankfully isn\u2019t developed as such, is as enjoyable as the main man himself. Aqua, that whiny goddess I was describing earlier, could have been your typical tsundere, all the signs in the first episode pointed towards that, but she\u2019s not. Aqua still retains her mighty arrogance whenever it\u2019s convenient for her, but she still mutually likes our dear Kazuma, even if it\u2019s sometimes equivalent to a dog begging their owner for food. Also being our local butt monkey, Aqua occasionally receives the short end of the stick on some occasions. But, Konosuba doesn\u2019t just characterize Aqua as just that and pack it\u2019s bags to leave, though. Aqua manages to have her moments where she\u2019s enjoyable to watch, not as a butt monkey, but as an actual character. Megumin, a future comrade who appears on the front page of /r/anime everyday, and Darkness, a masochistic tank, are also similar in this fashion but are definitely distinguishable as unique characters in their own right. Megumin, for instance, is instantly memorable as the chuunibyou magic mage who specializes in explosion magic. Darkness\u2019s masochistic behaviour around her enemies adds an interesting twist to battles, without managing to be too fanservicey. Konosuba treats them the same as Aqua, the jokes don\u2019t just revolve around their traits and that\u2019s just it, it actually manages to be unique with its jokes occasionally instead of just recycling the same concepts over and over again, and that\u2019s what I love about Konosuba.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound - Konosuba, having been animated by Studio Deen, doesn\u2019t look absolutely beautiful. This isn\u2019t to insult Deen, they\u2019ve actually done an amazing job on the visual spectrum and more in another show during the same season, Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, but I digress. This doesn\u2019t hinder Konosuba\u2019s quality, though, no, it even improves it I\u2019d say. Konosuba\u2019s animation is a little bit more on the loose side, some might even say it looks cartoony. But it fits the style of the show. Konosuba doesn\u2019t need amazing art, all it needs is just a good, quality jokes. The supposed Deen style of the show actually makes some jokes funnier than they would be have been if they were made by another studio, which is actually something I found to be refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Konosuba does have some good backgrounds and colors. Light colored surroundings fit the cheerful mood of the show. Moreover, character designs are actually pretty nice, being a little detailed here and there, and are coherent in color scheme, which is something that particularly stood out for me. And, since I\u2019m on characters, I should also note that the seiyuu have done an outstanding job portraying their characters, especially in a show where delivery is one of the main factors to making a joke stick. Kazuma\u2019s seiyuu, Jun Fukushima, does a brilliant job shifting between straight man to zany fun. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that Megumin\u2019s seiyuu, Rie Takahashi, is fairly new to the industry but nonetheless does a remarkable and promising performance. \u201cKazuma desu\u201d and Megumin\u2019s cries of explosion will forever be imprinted in my memories. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - Konosuba is an excellent comedy that is definitely worth watching. It\u2019s characters, premise, seiyuu, and art all come together to make quality gags. While the humour is not for everyone, and the plot and characters lack depth, those who accept the experience Konosuba will bring will be ready for one of the better comedies in anime. My Wednesday's will truly not be the same without the gift that was Konosuba.  \\n\r\n8/10",

            "content": "Kono Subarashii Sekai ni Shukufuku wo, is a contender to be one of the best animes of winter 2016. After deciding to watch it about 7/8 weeks into the season I was greeted with a great anime with pretty much all the elements I could have wanted from Fantasy and Comedy genre anime.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nI'm going to start by saying that I thought the story is the weakest part for me. This is mainly because even though there is a overarching story of what two of the characters want to do (Aqua and Satou) there is very little progression towards their goal. Instead its more ofa story of their daily lives within this new world that their are moved into and adapting to it. This new world even though it's a fantasy world, it does obviously takes parts from game ideas such as the idea of leveling up, being in a guild, doing quests etc. This isn't to say that each story in the episodes are bad, far from it. I thought they were honestly really good but it just feels like there was no real progression to their overall goal which brings it down to me. \\n\\n\r\nArt+Sound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nDecided to put these two categories together as there isn't really much I want to say about them and I gave them both an 8. The art style looks good, colourful, nothing I would consider wrong with it but just isn't anything that is unique or that stands out about it. The sound assets within the episodes seem good as well, nothing really stood out as being out of place for a sound effect. The opening song in my opinion is good enough to where I didn't skip it, but its not something I would add to a playlist to listen to beyond the anime. The closing song I actually really loved, something about it just felt really nice and calming about it. Maybe its the countryside vibe I get from listening to it that I enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis right here is what I loved about this anime. The characters. We basically have 4 main characters in this anime which gets built up over the episodes. \\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, we got Satou who is the only male main character. He is someone who enjoyed playing games before moving over to the fantasy and now is willing to become an adventurer. The main asset he has over the others is that he is smart (or at least smarter than the other 3 mains), which he does use to his advantage at times. Due to him being made out as the smart one and usually following his point of view you get to understand his frustrations, relieves and joys over the series which makes him to be a likeable character. \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, we have Aqua who is a goddess that let Satou to decide to move over into the fantasy world so he could have a new life and come along with him. She is very selfish, stubborn, isn't as intelligent as she thinks she is and is poor with money. Due to her actions you'll find yourself enjoying the bad moments that come to her as you feel like it is karma that has come back to get her in a way. Which in part brings in some of the comedy of the anime as well as her interactions with other people. \\n\\n\r\nNext there is Megumin. Who is obsessed with a particular magic type. Due to her obsession with this, she also comes across as stubborn (you'll see a small theme here). As you understand how powerful she can be, you also get to understand that her obsession doesn't always help people around her. Like with Aqua the comedy moments come with her interactions with other over her magic. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, there is Darkness. She is the least stubborn of the main 3 female characters. However, she does have the strong urge to get into harms way partly due to a sense of duty but mostly because she loves having eyes on her as she tries to absorb enemy attacks that may damage and lose pieces of her armor (not in an ecchi way like other anime). From which you see her having a sense of thrill from it which makes creates the comedy part of her character. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the 4 characters have a great dynamic with each other that creates most of the funny and comedy moments of the anime as Satou has to deal with the stubbornness of the other 3 while trying to use his head to keep they egos in check.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I really enjoyed the anime so that when I started watching the anime I would watch multiple episodes together. Each episode didn't feel to drag on, in fact I would say the opposite and that the episodes were over too quickly! I feel like I want more of the same from this anime and bit sad that there is only 10 episodes in total. But seemingly there looks like there is a 2nd season in the pipeline already so might not have to wait too long before it is back. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I always say, I score anime subjectively. Which is basically, how much did I enjoy it, would I watch it again and do I want more? If you read this review hopefully it has come across that I have enjoyed the anime immensely, even despite of what I think of the story progression. It is anime I will come back to watch again in the future and I can't wait for more to come out when the 2nd season is here.",

            "content": "When watching Konosuba, 2 anime came to my mind: Sword Art Online and Mondaiji-Tachi. It seems to have a combination of aspects from both.  \r\nStory: Our main character Kazuma is an otaku, on one of the  rare occasions where he leaves his room and goes out, he dies. Upon dying he finds himself in front of Aqua, a goddess, who gives Kazuma a choice: Go to heaven, or be reborn into an RPG-like world and help the people of that world defeat the devil king. Aqua allows Kazuma to take any sort of power, weapon or anything he chooses with him. After becomingannoyed at being teased by Aqua, Kazuma chooses to take her. This is accepted as part of the rules by heaven and thus she is sent to the other world with Kazuma, being unable to return until she has defeated the devil king. \\n\\n\r\n*The world and how it works (people being classified, guilds, quests to earn money, ability to learn skills, etc) is similar to SAO, but overall the anime feels like Mondaiji in the sense that it is more comedic then serious or dramatic. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound - The art isn't the best, I have noticed a few inconsistencies especially with character designs, but overall is fine and doesn't hinder the anime. Sound is ok, nothing rememberable about the OP or ED. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The characters are the best aspect of the anime, they are extremely funny and enjoyable. From Kazuma having a skill enabling him to 'unintentionally' steal underwear to Aqua repeatedly almost getting eaten by a giant frog after heavily overstating her abilities. Kazuma and Aqua are joined by Megumin, who knows powerful explosion magic, but it incapacitates her after one attack and darkness, a crusader who is a masochist. Character development is minimal, but due to the lack of plot it isn't really required. \\n\\n\r\n*Aqua reminds me of Black Rabbit from Mondaiji. \\n\r\n*The MC isn't absolutely clueless or ridiculously dense, which is a bonus. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - This anime series is brilliant, the comedy is there from the 1st episode and the characters are fun to watch. If you enjoy comedy and fantasty anime then you'll most likely enjoy this. If you enjoyed Sword Art Online because of the fighting monsters and clearing floors aspect then this isn't that type of anime, there is very very little plot progression.  \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Alright so here is my first review(a negative one) and let's see how this goes.I'm not take my time to explain what konosuba....you could just see the synopsis....yup as easy as that.All I wanna say is that you can see the amount of effort put into an anime with it's quality and konosuba is animethat makes no effort whatsoever to convince that this show is worth watching. Now keep in mind that if you don't mind an effortless    anime having some generic aspects you can pretty much enjoy this one.  Now the review is based on what I watched from thefirst 4 episodes which is what I believe to be enough to tell what kind of anime your watching so let's get going!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nStory 1/10\\n\r\nWell here is the thing...it's clear that this anime ia not trying to give us a well developed story to invest ourself in.it's more like an enjoyment anime.however the anime in the first 4 episodes does not progress any further nor does it exploits it's wirld well. It simply just gives very brief summary about what's going on and it does not expand on any of its aspects. It's does not serve the fantasy theme any justice!!!!!!it's  just a shame to be included in this kind of genre. But in the end the anime is more like a daily life comedy in parallel universe style so it might be a bit unfair to rate it's story.but the anime could have done MORE FKN EFFORT in drawing us into it's world and that's a big DISASTER!!!\\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10\\n\r\nGuys for damn sake it's 2016 already!!!!!!what's with low budget outdated art and animation.were they even trying????!!!!!this animation style could be accepted like 7 years ago but seriously that time is over.update yourself a little bit.the art is just plain and outdated and what's worse is the characters design. Now i guess here is where alot would like to debate with me...but if you look closely the design for each character is just also plain as the animation.the dress code is very generic,the character looks are also very generic and some are there for the sake of fanservice.Again this anime does not give any effort to make the drawings appealing which should have been there!!!!it's a fantasy anime it's drawings is supposed to make us WOW but nope...juuust plain art..FK U!!!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10\\n\r\nNow here is where the anime focusd a little bit..which is the presentation of the characters...now i said the anime is not attempting to develop a plot so expect a poorly developed character roster.but what we should focus here more is how enjoyable these characters are since this anime trying to be joyful and funny. I found the characters to be quite acceptable except for the main character.....he is like the 9999999999 copy of alot of main characters out there and there was no moment that enjoyed his envolvement.I am well aware that this could be different for others cuz sometimes clich\u00e9d characters are fun...but for me not this one. And again 0 effort ZERO FKN effort to make a unique character roster they are just the generic ones that you could find anywhere that you may like or dislike.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\r\nNow there is not much to talk about the soundtrack here..it doesn't stand out and it's not bad either....back to my point again z-e-r-o effort\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10\\n\r\nThe enjoyment if this anime could mostly come from how funny and joyfulit was. To me , the comedy for the most part is quite clich\u00e9d and really unfunny....i may have liked it if i was 10 years old but nope.of course there were parts that i think were unexpected and funny but just doesn't outweigh the boredom of this anime.action scenes......LOOOOOOOOL!!!!!what am i even saying...well since the animation is plain and there is not alot of action to begin with so i think it also failed here...the enjoybality this anime i think depends heavily on how funny you found it to be and you wont enjoy the action just..trust me\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n\r\nThis ladies and gentlemen is how you make a plain anime with no attempts whatsover on redefining the genre or to standout...it's BULLSHIT! !!!!However if you don't mind a ln effortless anime that is so generic and could have the potential to be joyful...then you might wanna check this one out.....and if you are an asshole like me....HIGHFIVE BRO AND STAY AWAY FROM THIS SHIT!!!!!!!",

            "content": "I made a video on this anime https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZAeKMUSHwo watch that if you'd rather LISTEN to this review. But here is the script for everyone else\r\nKonosuba, the show I picked up because DAYMN DAT MINISKIRT! Welcome to konosuba, a show that some might mistake as generic otaku pandering crap. But I see it as genius. Seriously though, Aqua\u2019s design is pretty erotic, Her skirt is so short you can see her butt, and she doesn't wear panties. I mean there are times when she bends over a LOT and you\u2019re thinking, woah no panties. CUZ SHE DOESN\u2019T WEAR EM\u2019! Aaaaand this isn\u2019t helping my case onproving this show is great. But in all seriousness, this is probably one of the more original shows to come out in a while with characters that don\u2019t mold into a cookie cutter. Not to mention, this is EASILY on my top 10 funniest anime. It\u2019s usually hard to have a full on comedy anime. Because alot of the time the show will just get stale if all it relies on are jokes. Most of the funniest animes I\u2019ve seen usually combine comedy with another genre. Typically with the romance and action genre.But despite this show being a pure comedy, it does NOT get old. But rather, it leaves the viewer wanting more. SERIOUSLY THIS IS A DISGRACE ANIME KEEP GETTING SHORTER AND SHORTER AND THIS SHOW DIDN\u2019T EVEN MANAGE TO GET 12 EPISODES! \\n\\n\r\nKonosuba is genuinely hilarious. Konosuba is a parody on cliche RPG\u2019s. There are so many parodies on RPG\u2019s online that you would think that every joke that could be made has been done already. But this show introduces us to a really derpy and overly goofy RPG world. That encompases giant frogs, killer cabages, AND EVIL DANGOS!!! Eat shit nagisa! What makes this show different from your typical animated RPG parody online is that they put so much effort into making the world of this show increasingly more fucking retarded episode by episode. What an internet parody won\u2019t do is build it\u2019s own incredibly autistic world. And what a typical internet parody ALSO wouldn\u2019t do is actually put effort into making the characters good. I mean seriously, every character in this cast is unique, funny and have good chemestry with each other. You got kazuma who other than his design isn\u2019t generic at all. Usually when you think of a main guy in an anime filled with cute girls. You think of a total wimp or a cliche nice guy. Kazuma on the other hand is a perverted, jaded asshole.\\n\\n\\n\r\n He\u2019s basically the straight man of the group pointing out the stupidity of the other characters. But Kazuma himself being a total asshole and pervert also creates alot of funny gags himself. Then you got Aqua, who\u2019s basically a goddess who got DAT ASS! Seriously if you\u2019re like me and you\u2019ll pick up an anime for T-T-TINY MINISKIRTS! Then this anime definiately delivers. But as for her character, she\u2019s basically incredibly arrogant with nothing to show. And she\u2019s so useless despite being a \u201cgodess\u201d that seeing her fail constantly is not only cathertic but funny. Then you got megumin, who is basically a goofy little girl that has an obsession with explosions. But fear not as she\u2019s not as much of an idiot as micheal bay. Key word of that sentence was \u201cAS\u201d. Honestly her obession with exploding things puts the characters in some pretty awkward situations. As she ya know, BLEW UP SOMEONES CASTLE AND NOW HE WANTS REVENGE! Then you got darkness. She\u2019s basically a masocistic pervert. She\u2019s easily the weakest character out of the main four. As she lacks character traits outside of being a masocistic pervert. But just seeing a female anime pervert is usually releiving as it\u2019s almost always the guy. And her whole masocist thing is ALWAYS being used, even during fights. Making the gag hilarous. And the gag unlike brocks gag in pokemon is done in more varity despite not being used limitedly. \\n\\n\r\nOther than the amazing humor and great cast to compliment the comedy, there isn\u2019t much else to say. I mean I will give this show props for not attemping to be mellodramatic and then failing. SCHOOL RUMBLE I\u2019M LOOKING AT YOU! But honestly this show probably could benefit from having slightly more emotion. There is one emotional moment in episode 7 that shows that despite the fact that all the girls in the show, are ya know, FUCKING BIZZARE, kazuma still loves being with them. And he cries when he is faced with the fact that he might lose them. However in spite of that, I still feel like the characters where somewhat fleshed out. The main character goes from being a jaded otaku nerd\u2026.to a slightly less jaded otaku nerd! Another strong point of this show, is even though it\u2019s 10 episodes it doesn\u2019t feel slow paced. Because weirdly enough, this show does a really good job on showing the passing of time. You really feel like the characters have been on this long journey for months. Even though you could probably watch this show in 4 hours. See what makes this show great is not really the character development. But more or less getting to see this journey of this hilarus rpg world that just keeps getting funnier and funnier. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that makes this world good is the artstyle. THe fucking animation itself looks goofy as hell some times. The characters look really off model all the time. Usually that\u2019s seen as a bad thing but that just compliments to the derpy nature of this show. See with dragonball super, the shitty artwork just destroys your emmersion. While with konosuba, ironically the bad art actually ADDS to the experiance. Not to mention, the colors in this show are beautiful.\u2026 What studio even made this anime. Studio deen. Studio deen\u2026. STUDIO DEEN STUDIO DEEN STUDIO DEEN!!! PEOPLE DIE WHEN THEY ARE KILLED!!!!! \\n\\n\r\nAlso I\u2019d like to mention that this show does one thing right that not many shows do correctly. Boob sizes. In most shows they usually draw the boobs in one size. It makes sense because animes are usually adapted from a manga. And typically artists have an easier time drawing the boob size they are use to drawing rather than having varitiy\u2026 I would know because I am an artist. (wisper) Be sure to follow me on twitter to check out my art work! See usually in anime they ether make all the boobs really big. Or all of them really small, with litte variation. This show has 3 main girls and all 3 with different breast sizes. You got megumin whos uhhh\u2026 probably underaged and I probably shouldn\u2019t be commenting on that! (Sirens) IT\u2019S A CARTOON, IT\u2019S NOT A REAL GIRL WHAT DID I DO WRONG!!!!! Then aqua with medium size tities and DAT BUTT! And then darkness with boobs so big you\u2019d probably have to be around the age of 13 to like those things. Hey guys, boob sizes matter HASHTAG BOOB SIZES MATTER!!! Lets get that shit trending on twitter!\\n\\n\r\nAnyways guys be sure to PENETRATE OH YEA MAKE LOVE to that subscribe button for more SEXY anime videos. I\u2019m going to be reviewing more seasonal animes and also, aquas ass is so nice, it inspired me to make a top 5 best asses in anime. Because let me be real, anime doesn\u2019t appricate the ass as much as it should. ANIME Y U NO LIKE BUTTS!!! And ways spank that like button and be sure to write a comment with the hashtag boob sizes matter! As always this has been your boy mightypie good night good bye and big balls. \\n",
