Trinity Seven would have been utterly average and forgettable if it wasn't for its characters.\r\nThe MC is, for once, not as dense as a brick, which already puts him ahead of majority of other harem leads. Arata is powerful and competent, so he doesn't have to be protected by the girls all the time. He's also unapologetically perverted, and it's quite refreshing to see him handle the inevitable ecchi situations with humor and honesty instead of stuttered apologies.\r\nMost of the girls are rather likeable as well, from the prudishand easily-embarrassed Lilith (a great target for Arata's teasing) to the mischievous and confident Levi, who developed a certain camaraderie with the MC and even goes along with his perverted jokes. Their interactions with Arata and each other are usually quite entertaining. Violent tsundere tendencies, while present in one or two characters, are thankfully toned down. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Trinity Seven is an otherwise average harem carried by an awesome male lead and charming female characters.",

One thing that I realized I liked was that he wasn't as overpowered as any other anime would have made him.\r\n- Aiko: One of the supporting characters in the Trinity Seven. There was something different about her from other female characters of any anime. She stood out to me the most (besides MC).\r\nCons:\r\n- Horrible plot development. Just so messy.I almost dropped it becauseit bothered me that much.\\n\r\n- The amount of fan service. I do like a bit myself, but there comes a point where it's too much. Trinity Seven goes past that point.\\n\r\n- Every female character, other than Aiko.\\n\r\n- Character development was atrocious. Nothing was explained well. For example, what are any of the \"processes\"? What actual powers do the grimories have? \\n\r\n- Hijiri: To not include any spoilers, I won't describe much. As I watched, I just wanted to say what the actual F? If you decide to watch the anime, you'll understand.\\n\\n\r\nI will say that this anime is on the lower end of my spectrum of choice. I think that the story would have been executed better in a longer season.",

            "content": "Trinity Seven ~8~\r\nSo ~ the end of this anime season is approaching and I find myself, once again, trying to come up with reasonable ratings for the various anime which I followed over the past months.\r\n~ Unsafeman121 Dec 2014\r\n~ Plot ~\r\n~8~\r\nVery intriguing and at first slightly mysterious, the plot makes you keep wanting some more. There many times at which the episode ended and I just wanted to be able to continue watching. It seems fairly well thought out and the happenings all seem to fit into the world well. There are times when parts could be explained a little bit more clearly, such asin the Library section, however I feel that this did not detract from my enjoyment of the anime. Each \"section\" feels like it brings everything a little bit closer together and it is very satisfying to watch. There are very few times where I felt there wasn't progress in the plot, and yet still a good amount of character development is achieved. The combination of these two make this anime a worthy watch.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~\\n\r\n~7~\\n\r\nAlthough I did not particularly enjoy either the OP or ED of this anime, I felt that the voices were VERY well suited to the characters, everything fits well and it certainly helps the ease with which one can watch this anime. I didn't find any issue with any background music that played in the anime, and wasn't distracted by any of it, but in the same regard, it didn't blow me away as anything incredible.\\n\\n\r\n~Visuals~\\n\r\n~8~\\n\r\nPersonally, I enjoyed the visuals, I felt as if they were above average for an anime of this type and I was sometimes impressed by certain backgrounds or settings. You can tell that effort has been put in to make this anime look great, and it is another reason for which this anime is so enjoyable to watch. It is well detailed and there are few things about it which I would change if I had the choice. (You can tell they put lots of effort into the fanservice ;) )\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\r\n~9~\\n\r\nOne of the strong points about this anime, the characters are all very likable and well made. There is sufficient character development (for an anime of this length), that you feel for some of the characters and get to know them a little bit more than in some other anime. There is an incredible mix of characters, and each on adds to the feeling of the anime. They each have their traits and they all seem to function well together in terms of interaction. It doesn't feel like any of the characters make any of the others redundant. The way in which they can synergise their powers is clever and I feel that this was a slightly more unique aspect.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\r\n~9~\\n\r\nThis is one of the anime which I have thoroughly enjoyed. There are several reasons for this, though obviously as I don't want to give any spoilers, I will not mention many of them. A lot of they enjoyment I feel, came from the very well written script and the interactions of the characters with each other and their relationships.\\n\\n\r\n~Overall~\\n\r\n~8~ \\n\r\n\"This was more enjoyable to watch than the average anime, would recommend to others.\"\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, this anime is above par and one that I would recommend to people, even if they hadn't specifically mentioned the title themselves. There is a great mix of characters, their voices fit and the plot is great. This is one of the better anime out of the ones I have been watching this season (4th release date of 2014)\\n\\n\r\nFor those who are interested ~ Ranking Progression:\\n\r\nThis is where I show the changes (if any) in my overall rating as the anime progressed, I review my ratings every 4 episodes ~ though if one does stand out for me I will also mention it.\\n\\n\r\nE01: 7\\n\r\nE04: 7\\n\r\nE08: 7\\n\r\nE09: 8 (Rated up 1)\\n\r\nE12: 8",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nWhere most people worry about what to get their family members for the holidays, others are more concerned about the actual state of the world. Global warming, earthquakes, and solar flares are all major issues that scientists and those worried about the Earth's future are thinking about daily. They wonder if these types of disasters can be avoided, to prevent the destruction of the place we call home. Whether or not anything is ultimately preventable is certainly a courageous endeavor, often needing help from the many and not the few. This sets the stage for Trinity Seven, astage filled with breasts, harems, and not much more.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nTrinity Seven begins with Arata, a young man who loses his cousin Hijiri to a \"collapse phenomenon,\" prompting him to leave with Lilith to a magical high school where he discovers he is the next \"demon lord candidate.\"\\n\\n\r\nTrinity Seven is classified as a harem, and it does this portion of the show well. When it is focusing on the fan-service and sexualization, it is rife with opportunities to show the girls off being as cute and beautiful as possible. A lot of this is owed to their varying personalities, antics, and general adoration of Arata. The anime attempts to switch up the pairings where it can, allowing the girls to flaunt their stuff as much as possible. On the whole, this gives the series a competent amount of ecchi content.\\n\\n\r\nIt all goes downhill when it is not focusing on this side, however. One of Trinity Seven's largest issues comes from the cast itself. The anime is constantly throwing out new characters from start to finish. This is not an exaggeration; literally until the final episode, new characters are being shown. Being an entirely character driven show, one would think that such an endeavor would be acceptable. But it doesn't work. As more and more characters are brought in, two more problems arise. The older characters are not given enough screen-time, causing them all to lack development and caring towards them needed by the audience. At the same time, the newer characters, given their later and later introductions, suffer the same fate. No character is given enough time to be properly explored, making the cast become props to ogle at rather than well-defined people. It's a vicious cycle that persists throughout the entire season, bringing about an unsavory amount of chaos.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw comes from the plot itself. Much of what occurs is completely nonsensical in nature due to the exorbitant amount of terminology the anime throws at the audience. \"Archives,\" \"Themas,\" and other foreign words are tossed around as if the audience is supposed to simply understand why they are being used or where they originate. The anime never delves into any sort of world-building, merely saying phrases in passing or nonchalantly talking about how certain aspects of their magic work. There is no pretext, context, or subtext for anything that goes on. Both the overall arc and sub-plots contain this problem, throwing the entire experience into disarray.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nGenerally less than stellar, Trinity Seven adopts rather awkward techniques for both its art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nBeginning with the art style, the characters are typically set to CGI backgrounds. This allows them to stand out more noticeably when compared to other anime, mainly because of the jarring juxtaposition of 3D and 2D elements. The anime looks better when it is not using such a trick, but even then, the unvarying amount of locations that are visited provides little in the way of eye-candy.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this candy is found with (once again) the best part of the show: the girls and their character designs. Ranging from elegant to slutty, bodacious to simple, the girls all maintain the same style but differ when it comes to overall looks, faces, hair, outfits, etc. They're all attractive in their own respective ways, making the designs pleasing to see on a regular basis.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual animation, though, is sorely missing. Character movements are often kept to a minimum and many shots consist of only one character at a time. The most notable drop in animation comes from the \"fight\" scenes. They are meant to be small duels or skirmishes, but they are never really depicted as such. Quick cuts, simple attacks, and more often than not refusing to show the action itself demonstrates just how little animation there really is.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nBeing a harem, Trinity Seven contains a large main cast. More specifically, and perhaps obviously, there are seven young women who take the spotlight. I'll stick to talking about Arata and my favorite four.\\n\\n\r\nAs a main character, Arata is actually not immensely dense. Perverse and funny, he allows the Trinity Seven themselves to shine as much as possible. Determined to see his cousin once more, he goes to great lengths to accomplish the goals he sets for himself. As a new demon lord candidate, he is able to control magic as he wills. It's this and his all-around likability that causes the girls to flock to him, despite his affinity for all things debauched.\\n\\n\r\nActing as the head of the defense department, Mira is a shorter woman who does not tolerate any form of impure thoughts or actions. Extremely shy yet demanding, she usually butts heads with Arata due to their opposite, base ideals. Her strong suit is being capable of reflecting or disabling any form of magic. Her highly defensive combat abilities also manifest in her personality, making her difficult to approach let alone talk to. However, the more time she spends with Arata, the further her shell cracks, revealing a more comfortable and caring friend.\\n\\n\r\nLiese is a succubus first and magic-user second. Relying almost entirely on her well-endowed assets, she utilizes her sex appeal to its fullest potential. Her playful nature causes her to invade people's privacy regularly. She has no qualms making others feel uncomfortable, since she is so content with her own body and her sexuality. To aid her in this process, she is able to bend time to her will. Liese starts off as a tough antagonist, aiming to become the next \"demon lord\" before Arata. But due to his affable personality, she transitions from difficult foe to treasured companion, presenting an argument to the saying, \"time heals all wounds.\"\\n\\n\r\nYui is a strange girl, to say the least. She exists within two separate dimensions at the same time: one in the real world and another in a dream-like state. The former is incredibly happy, carefree, and quick to call Arata \"Onii-san\" whenever she is given the chance. Her dream-self is quiet and calm, producing an aura of elegance that the rest of the girls do not own. Her magic takes on a supportive role, boosting the power of those around her. Being the first of the Trinity Seven that brings Arata hardship to \"capture,\" when she is ultimately saved, her supportive attitude shines through, making her an extremely wonderful addition to the cast.\\n\\n\r\nTechnically the poster-girl for the show, Lilith is Arata's mentor and first of the girls to give her trust. Easily embarrassed, sincere, and willing to guide people down the right path, she is most often found looking after Arata. Her beauty is unrivaled, and so are her skills as a professor. She is at maximum cuteness when she is blushing after being teased or hearing/seeing Arata say/do something slightly perverted. Her abilities take the form of handheld weapons -- guns -- that shoot out magic with high speed and intensity. While she incessantly yells at Arata for his continuous behavior, deep down, like the guns she wields, her emotions and feelings for him are incredibly strong and unyielding.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with the other three (Levi, Arin, and Akio), and a few of the other side cast, each of them have their own descriptions and a connection between their personality and the skills they have. While the entire cast is neither fleshed out nor too memorable, there is bound to be someone here for everyone to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP for the anime is actually quite good. The beginning part with the hard guitar and choir-like singing starts the piece off strong. The middle section follows suit, with guitar, drums, and vocals working well in unison. The halfway point, with the \"falling\" effects in the singing and drums causes one to bob their head to the beat. Just the nice amount of variety from the piece makes it stand out from the pact.\\n\\n\r\nYou may be able to choose the destination, but you shouldn't choose the first ED. It's a mess of singing and instruments that is not pleasant to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nThe second ED takes a slightly slower approach that works miles better than the first. Its float-y feel and \"shavadava,\" alongside the more onomatopoeia vocals, make it a fun song to hear, coinciding with the stronger parts of the anime. It is Arguably the best of the EDs.\\n\\n\r\nED number three goes back to being quick, and subsequently back to being bad. It's a rather strange song, containing a piano melody and both fast and higher singing that don't work well together.\\n\\n\r\nThe final ED is the worst of the bunch. Nothing attributed to the song seems to flow, creating an even worse amalgamation than what the first ending piece offered. The techno background beat and mid-range vocals create an awkward arrangement that doesn't fit well with the anime, as well as making it rather forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack mostly consists of ambient pieces filled with violins and darker tones that fit the more \"evil\" vibe the show contains during the more serious portions. However, none of the tracks are noteworthy.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting within the anime is average, with no notable performances to be had.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to an anime like this, it prioritizes boobs, butts, and sex first with story and characters coming in at a distant second. In that regard, the show satiates one's need for good fan-service. Seeing Lilith nearly naked, having Arin and Yui cuddling with their \"husband,\" and watching Liese's attempts at seduction made me quite the happy man.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the anime tried to make the action and plot its focus, I really just wanted them to go back to the comedy and the harem elements that it was doing so well at. And as the series progressed, it started fixating its eyes on its weakest parts more and more, making the experience less fun the further along it went.\\n\\n\r\nFor what it's worth, Trinity Seven tried to be more than just a run-of-the-mill harem. But its inability to balance the characters, its rather awful narrative (even among the genre), and strange decisions in regards to animation and music make the entire package less than average.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, good fan-service, too many characters, terrible world-building\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, jarring 2D/3D mix, nice character designs, little animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Arata, Mira, Liese, Yui, and Lilith are okay, with someone for everyone\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, good OP, bad EDs, okay soundtrack, average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, fun to watch only when the women are the focus\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

            "content": "A \"Harem\" is a magical word used to describe every straight male's ideal reality in which every single girl he comes in counter with wants to hop on his yaoi stick. The harem is typically courted by a dense male lead and at least five girls -- each with a different hair color than the others. This male lead will then become involved in at least three scenarios (Per episode) in which he accidentally touches one of these girls in one of their private areas and thus receives a slap in the face, followed by blushing and an occasional punch that defies the laws ofphysics and sends him skyrocketing across the galaxy. Trinity Seven is an atypical representation concerning this definition of \"Harem\".\\n\\n\r\nKasuga Arata (Only dude pictured above) isn't your typical dense \"Omg I have no idea you want to bang me\" protagonist. This is where a lot of the charm Trinity Seven has to offer comes into play. We meet him as the world he resides in is being torn to shreds, ultimately ending humanity. In his final moments, his cousin hands him a necklace/grimoire-thingy (Before falling into a crevice opening up in the world) which contains a magical entity that will allow him to essentially re-shape the world on a journey to find that cousin. However, in order to do that, he must become acquainted with the \"Trinity Seven\" which is the name given to the seven magus females that all want to swallow his mana.\\n\\n\r\nBut the cool thing about Trinity Seven is that it never really feels dull. It's predictable in a good way, which sounds weird at first -- but makes sense in context. You won't grow to hate the main character, which is a common flaw that harems typically encounter as they progress. This all culminates in one of the most surprisingly entertaining shows to come out of Fall 2014. In order to better illustrate this, let me break it up into a few key components.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\r\nTrinity Seven sports a soundtrack that is infused with hard-rock, techno, funk, and some sweet-ass bass lines. It's actually quite good when listening to it even out of context. The music never seems like it's \"Just there\". It serves as a good sidekick during fight scenes and allows the audience to keep their eyes fixed to the screen without feeling distracted or irritated by overly-obnoxious music typically prevalent in action-sequences. On top of this, the opening song is pretty damn catchy and becomes an essential part of every episode that almost anyone would look forward to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nThe best part of this show really lies within the characters. Each one carries their own distinct personality and complements the protagonist almost perfectly. In harems, another common problem is how viewers will basically choose one girl that they want the protagonist to end up with. This results in hate bubbling up for the other girls and eventually ends up on some message-board like /a/ where everyone argues about who is \"Best girl\". In Trinity Seven, it's actually pretty hard to decide who you want to \"Win\". To be perfectly honest, I still don't know which girl would make the best pairing with Arata. Maybe Mira. Or Lilith. I don't know, just let me keep Levi to myself. Anyway, it's this aspect that makes the characters enjoyable all-around. One thing I would have liked to see though, would be character development for anyone outside of Arata. Everyone seems kind of snug within their own niche, not ever changing from who they already are.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nAt first, I didn't know how I felt about the visuals that were put in front of me in Trinity Seven. Three episodes later, I adored it. There was just that period of \"Mehhhh\" time it took for me to feel it out. I felt the same way about Madoka Magica when I watched that, and now I think it's one of the most beautiful shows I've ever seen. Trinity Seven shouldn't really be compared to Madoka outside of the \"Girls with magical powers\" thing, but you probably understand what I mean when I say you might not like it at first. Just give it some time. I promise. In addition to the general artwork, character designs were unique and impressive. It appeared as if the artists actually put love and care into each one, treating them more as actual characters than curious teenage girls waiting to be taken advantage of after meeting a boy for the first time. Each one was extremely different from the others (Apart from Lieselotte and Selina, but you know...twins) and I never got tired of seeing them.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nTrinity Seven has a solid story. Is it great? No, not by any means. But it's more than you'll normally find in this genre. The protagonist actually has a goal that he is constantly moving toward. The side-characters try their best to aid him in this endeavor. It just works out. There are periods where things seem bleak, but those periods are then counteracted by others that seem hopeful. Each episode actually goes somewhere, which is a feat that so many shows struggle with nowadays. The series even ends on a note that will allow for another season or two if season one sells well enough. Hell, I might even pick up manga one day if I get bored enough. Once again, solid storytelling by writer, Kenji Saitou, and director, Hiroshi Nishikiori.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Trinity Seven is a very well-rounded harem/comedy with a few fight scenes thrown in for action and a story that actually goes somewhere. If you are a fan of fan-service, character design, or laughing, I would give it a try. It definitely surprised me and became an easy favorite for the year of 2014.",

This one is a bit different, with the main character being more open and honest, and all the women bashing him in a more realistic manner it brings a more refreshing feel to this anime that is rarely seen. Story leaves out some info on what is going on from the get go. And your left to piece it together throughout the majority of the anime. With the plot left on the stove tothicken as you go it keeps you intrigued as to why exactly everything is going on and by the end found myself wanting more. I would definitely appreciate a 2nd season.",

            "content": "In my short time of reviewing anime, I've covered quite a few different types of harems. I've done dramatic harems, reverse harems, and even harems that didn't start out as harems. However, I realized recently that I've never done a review for just a regular old comedic harem, so I decided to pick one up for this season. Upon finishing the series, I realized that everything I want to say about it could pretty much apply to every other comedic harem I've seen. So, aside from the specific anime I'm covering today, consider this asan appropriate substitute review for any other generic comedic harem you can think of (Rosario + Vampire, Highschool DxD, Infinite Stratos, Maken-ki!, etc.), as I rattle off the list of traits that this genre keeps using over and over and over again to make itself as bland and marketable as possible.\\n\\n\r\n1. Fantasy setting or heavy fantasy elements, usually involving magic\\n\r\n          While more traditional and realistic settings may have worked back in the heyday of harems like Love Hina, the incorporation of fantasy elements serves as a replacement for actually making the viewer believe that this type of romantic setup could occur in the first place. Additionally, the use of magic creates a plethora of possibilities for getting the female characters into situations of a lewd and nearly-naked nature, with very minimal effort on the part of the writer. For Trinity Seven, we end up with one of Arata's main powers being the ability to make people's clothes disappear, providing plenty of fan service fun.\\n\\n\r\n2. Story still manages to take place in a high school of some kind\\n\r\n          I'm not sure what the exact percentage is of anime that take place in high school, but I'm going to assume it's a relatively high number, and within the harem genre the reason for that is very simple: it attracts viewers who are currently in high school. Additionally, with Trinity Seven, we get bonus points added for the high school being an all-girls school (while it's never explicitly stated that this is the case, no other male students seem to appear in this school). This further allows for Arata to be given free reign over whatever love interest the series decides to throw in for our enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\n3. Actual story and magic lore is incredibly convoluted and pointless\\n\r\n          For obvious reasons, writers can't just get away with writing absolutely nothing but fan service moments, so of course there has to be some kind of story. However, writing an actual story would make it too difficult for the viewers to focus on those wonderfully-animated breasts you just shoved into frame [heavy-handed sarcasm], so the plot needs to be flimsy, shallow, and easily tradable with any other generic plot. Every magic term in Trinity Seven is practically thrown in your face one after another with little more than a one-sentence description of what it actually does. That didn't really matter though, because I couldn't even count the times where I just flat-out looked away from the screen for a minute or so and then turned back to realize that absolutely nothing has happened other than some more flashy magic terminology and a panty shot.\\n\\n\r\n4. Random climactic battle at the end of the series\\n\r\n          ...yeah that's just kind of a thing I guess. I suppose they have to at least pretend that they're putting some kind of effort into their writing at the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\n5. Always, ALWAYS leave room for a second season\\n\r\n          The harem genre is surprisingly easy to market and sell to viewers, so it's important to keep the money train going until no one shows any interest in your specific series anymore.\\n\\n\r\n6. Main character has some kind of power that no one else has\\n\r\n          To be fair, this is a trait that's common even outside the harem genre, but within harems it adds something entirely different. With an action series, being the only one with a certain power or ability makes you humanity's last hope for survival. In a harem, it makes you an object of desire. Of course all the ladies want to jump your bones; you're the only person here who has this super awesome power. In the case of Trinity Seven, Arata is the \"Demon Lord Candidate\" who has the potential to turn into the Demon Lord, one of the most powerful beings in the world. Another important note is that the power in question is incredibly generic and normally just equates to \"I'm stronger than everyone else because reasons.\"\\n\\n\r\n7. Main character is either overtly perverted or a shy nice guy (who's still incredibly perverted on the inside), but is also incredibly noble\\n\r\n          Again, to be fair to Trinity Seven, Arata certainly falls into the former category, and he becomes so blatant with his perversity that it's almost hard to not like him for it (almost being the important word there). As for the nobility aspects, it plays into why the girls fall for him in the first place. I mean sure he's super perverted but he's just this super nice guy that I can rely on underneath all of that [more heavy-handed sarcasm]. Everything about a harem is designed to make the main male character look awesome, and Trinity Seven certainly doesn't miss its mark.\\n\\n\r\n8. Female characters have no depth other than their assigned archetypes\\n\r\n          When you have this many female love interests on your cast, it's nearly impossible to give them enough characterization to make them feel fleshed-out while still finding time for fan service moments, so the best course of action is to flood your series with as many archetypes as you can: the childhood friend (Hijiri), the plain Jane (Lilith), the loli (Grimoire), the tsundere (Mira), the kooky one (Levi), the childish one (Yui), the tomboy (Akio), ad nauseam.\\n\\n\r\n9. Primary love interest is as bland as a piece of notebook paper\\n\r\n          If the love interest that the main character is eventually going to end up with actually has a personality, the writers run the risk of the viewers not enjoying that specific archetype, so it's always best to choose the one with the least amount of personality possible (and also the biggest cup size). Of course, the two characters in question will never actually reach the point where they could be considered to be in a relationship. I mean lord forbid that you actually do something romantically interesting with your characters.\\n\\n\r\n10. All animation budget goes towards character designs and boob physics\\n\r\n          The fan service is the main selling point of a harem, so it's absolutely vital that this is achieved, often at the cost of the rest of the animation looking terrible. Studio Seven Arcs knows this very well and gave us exactly that. While the action in Trinity Seven wasn't completely awful, the particle and light effects certainly weren't anything worthy of praise, and backgrounds and moving objects were often rendered in the most eye-jarring 3D I've seen in a long time.\\n\\n\r\n11. Fan service out the wazoo\\n\r\n          This one doesn't really need much explanation. You're certainly not watching this because the romance is so unbelievably captivating.\\n\\n\r\n12. Soundtrack occupies the background for the majority of the anime's run time\\n\r\n          I honestly can't even think of a single note from this soundtrack off the top of my head right now, and I just finished the last episode about an hour ago. In this case, the soundtrack was composed by Technoboys Pulcraft Green-Fund (Witch Craft Works), and I wouldn't necessarily blame them for the blandness of the soundtrack because this is a harem after all, and there isn't exactly a long list of standout harem soundtracks.\\n\\n\r\n          Overall, I do think that anime viewers should experience a simple comedic harem at least once, but Trinity Seven certainly isn't the one I would recommend as an introduction to the genre.",

            "content": "With the end of the year 2014 its finally time to also close one of the darkest chapters of my entire life. A chapter which is known as Trinity Seven. Really. I don't even know why I went all the way watching it to the end. Still, its an interesting experience.\r\nEven though its just something along the lines of 'Whew, now I really can point my finger on an anime that is actually... bad.'\r\nBack to serious mode. Obviously I'm still going to be fair with this anime.\r\nFirst of all, storywise. What does this anime have in store for us?\r\nThe mainstory is reasonable simple and catchy.Our MC Arata looses  his cousin Hijiri to a magical phenomenom. So far so well. Thats nothing too bad, it explains what we should have to expect for the next episodes. But why do I dislike the story so much then? Simple. That phenomenom is called 'Breakdown Phenomenom' and is just the first of billions of mechanics which is fired in your face with the speed of a minigun and the power of a railgun. Followed up by Themas and some latin words, sudden english imputs like Limit Breaks, irish legends (Brioriac and Fragrach), etc. The setting of this anime just sucks so hard. Nothing really gets explained in a roundabout way, and even after 12 episodes the only thing I got is that the thema is supposedly the exact opposite to your character. But its not like this is all which sucks storywise. The story is mainly a gauntlet of boobsfondling scenes, slice of life, and obvious plottwists. Just awfully done.\\n\r\nSo overall, I rated the story 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nNext are the artworks. The character designs aren't too bad, even though their colors are a bit pale. Also, I always got annoyed with their faces. They look mostly emotionless, and if you leave away the hairstyles, identical. The backgrounds are no awardwinners either. They are good enough to stand their ground. They aren't too sharp, but are rather colorful. A strange contrast to the grayish-pale characters. Lastly the battlescenes. Swordattacks are the usual black-screen/cut style ones. Uhh... really good, I guess? Nope. The magic isn't that much better, mostly laserbeams and glowing stuff and such.\\n\r\nWhich brings me to 5/10 for the Artworks.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is the best part of Trinity Seven. By far. Lets start with the voice actors. Matsuoka Yoshitsugu aka. Kirito returns. Matsuoka-san isn't new to ecchi by any means, as he also voiced the MC of Mangaka-san to Assist-san to. His performance is as good as ever. The rest of the cast isn't really memorable, but they depicted their characters good enough. The OSTs of Trinity Seven on the other hand were mediocre. As for battle soundtracks we have some mechanical/techno/futuristic kind of music, which reminds me of a worse version of Xenoblade's Mechanical rhythm. The rest of the time the BGM fits the situation without being memorable.\\n\r\nFinally the OP/ED. Seven Doors by ZAQ is a fairly good song, which made it into my 2014 favorites. It got me hyped up for the following 20 minutes and is one of the sole reasons I continued to watch.\\n\r\n7/10 for sounds.\\n\\n\r\nFinally we arrived at Trinity Sevens' achilles heel. The characters.\\n\r\nIf you wonder what exactly is bad about them? Probably everything.\\n\r\nThe Initial character designs are rather flat. None of the characters feel fresh or new. I've seen not completely dense MCs before, and the rest of the Trinity Seven reeks of stereotypes.\\n\r\nI don't even remember whether the girls have backgroundstories or not. As for the interactions between the characters, those aren't any better. Most of the slice of life parts circle around groping boobs, or how lewd Arata is. Whew. Amazing... Finally, the character development. Basically the females all fell for Arata. Thats all the development I got. Thats rather disappointing.\\n\r\nFor the last of the obejective categories I go with 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now the last one. The enjoyment.\\n\r\nWell, you can see on my profile how I rate enjoyment. So lets just say 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10.\\n\r\nA just below average harem anime with more potential than turnout.\\n\r\nThe production values are rather high, but the execution of the plot, the setting, as well the characters are rather bad.\\n\\n\r\nFeedback is appreciated, as usual.",

            "content": "Overall rating should be 8 but...\r\n---\r\nTrinity Seven is a decent Action/Comedy/Ecchi Anime, so if you are not a fan of ecchi, please skip this one. I mean it's very decent anime, but it's not good enough to make you start liking ecchi or something. Anyway, for those who have intention of going for this one, let me encourage you. I won't spoil anything.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nA guy whose cousin disappeared one day decided to learn magic to get her back. Then he went to a magic school, where he met the Trinity Seven AND where his real story began... To be honest, the story is not reallyimpressive. It has some flaws, it's weird, it doesn't really have anything outstanding. You will find awkward and funny moments along with VERY VERY stupid situations and you have to wonder: \"Wtf, why won't they attack instead of talking\". However, in the end, the story is truly enjoyable and I say that you may want to give it a try.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art is good, but not quite impressive. You will find most anime today, 2014, have similar art level and some shows have even better art. Don't expect anything memorable from the art of this show because it's just enough for you to enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nTotally personal experience: I don't find any of the songs catchy so I will give it a 7.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nSeriously, you will have a hard time finding a second female main character like in Trinity Seven: Arata Kasuga. Besides the fact that he is a very caring and nice person, he is perverted, kind of like obvious in an ecchi anime, but he doesn't hesitate to show it out. Also, he is NOT stupid. He knows that the girls have feelings for him and he is willing to accept it.\\n\r\nAlso, Lilith Asami is a very cute girl :D\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI have to say I really enjoy it. It's not an outstanding anime, it may not get your intention, but I like it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nBUT +1 due to the fact that I have a good time watching the show.\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nGive the show a try and make the judgement on your own. The show's worth it.",

            "content": "I'm backwards, so overall first: 8 \r\nComing into the show, you should know first off that this is an ecchi/harem/romance comedy with a sometimes serious aura to push the story along when necessary. If fanservice bothers you, Trinity Seven isn't for you, plain and simple. If that's part of the fun for you, then prepare to be along on a trip to Sexy Japanese Hogwarts.\r\nStory: 7.5 (rounds down to 7, more on that later)\r\nContinuing the Harry Potter analogy: MC Arata gets his life turned upside down when he finds out that there is INDEED magic in his world, and it's about to change his life...or at least introduce him to some beautiful new lady friends. \\n\r\nThe first section feels a bit disjointed, but it's mostly about character building. From about the halfway point on, it's pretty easy to tell where the plot is going, but that's not to say you can't have fun on the way there. The pacing can be a bit inconsistent, but again, from the midpoint on, it stabilized.\\n\r\nNothing groundbreaking here, a fairly simple setup of the oft seen \"I must rescue the one i love\", but with a couple of twists to keep it fresh. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThere are a couple of moments I found really cool where they used real life photography with animation on top of it- had not seen that before. Otherwise, it just looks like your everyday normal anime. Character art is fine, and the action sequences are well animated, but nothing that will blow you away. (I compare things to Sword Art Online, which i find to be incredible well animated) \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe intro and four (count 'em) ending themes are all appropriately energetic and catchy. Not much to say here\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nThis is the meat of the show: the characters. You can't have a harem without breaking a few eggs, right? (woops, wrong idiom) \\n\r\nMC Arata isn't a blockhead moron. He knows what he wants, just not how to do it. He's also not afraid to get his hands dirty.\\n\r\nThe titular Trinity Seven are a group of (all female) skilled mages who are cream of the crop in their particular area of study. They are varied, and fun, and definitely memorable. They aren't all introduced at once, so you get some time to know them before they all show up. I had no trouble remembering or telling them all apart, even though it felt like they introduced someone new every episode. The villains are varied, but I felt like they were rushed a little (in terms of development), but it is a 13 episode show, so not much time to work with.\\n\r\nThey are all motivated in their own ways, and each one has a reason to be there besides checking off boxes in the harem trope *yawn*. Each member plays their part: they do it with style and a healthy dose of sexiness, or tsundere, your pick. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOne of the absolute best parts of the show (for me, the only person whose opinion matters) was the 4th wall destroying humor. I love self aware comedy, and Trinity Seven delivers with a sledgehammer. Arata is also (from what i understand of harems, this is uncommon) an incorrigible pervert, and thrives in the intensely tense estrogen filled environment into which he's thrown (sometimes with the help of a friend). I never found that the show took the scandalous content too far- it never devolves into anything porn-like- strictly pg-13.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts: \\n\r\nFun anime, and after going back and reading the manga, it follows it INCREDIBLY closely, which I thought was excellent. Seven Days took a fun little product, added some extra polish and a bit of movement to the tv screen, and here we are. Looking forward to *hopefully* a second season.",

            "content": "Reconnect to the Invidia Archive.  Executing my Thema: Circumspicio!  What better way to introduce Trinity Seven, a series I've personally dubbed one of the best entries in the harem genre, than an introduction like that?  \r\nStory (7.88/10):  The story of trinity seven is as follows.  A boy by the name of Arata finds himself in his normal life.  Waking up with his normal cousin making him breakfast, his normal walk to school, and even his normal everyday boob grab.  But, soon, he notices something...different.  The world around him has no one else nearby.  There are nopeople, and he notices that the sun is a malicious black.  Then, he gets threatened by a girl with a rifle saying to him about something called a breakdown phenomenon, and the fact that HE himself has caused it with his magic.  And from that point forward, Arata's life of leisure changes as he delves himself into the world of magic and gets to know the seven most powerful mages in the world, the Trinity Seven.\\n\\n\r\nTrinity seven is a very interesting show.  The best way to sum the show up in a few words is \"Harem with a Plot.\"  What makes Trinity Seven so much more different than other harem shows is the fact that the show itself does follow a chronological order of events.  It doesn't use ecchi as the \"audience bringer\" (although, there are enough ecchi moments to fill up two whole episode slots), and it does follow a proper plot, following Arata as he goes through his new life as a mage with the Trinity Seven.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that makes the show very unique is its brand of magic.  Like every other supernatural magic show, Trinity Seven boasts its own explanation for the idea of magic which is honestly one of the best points of the show.  This is due to the fact that the magic for the show is heavily integrated into the show's plot, giving explanation along the way for viewers.  But depending on the viewer, it can get a little difficult to understand due to the heavily thrown out terms that one must learn in order to fully enjoy this show.  (Things like macros, Themas, etc.)  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, Trinity seven hosts its own brand of comedy which is...well, subjective.  (It's harem, what do you expect?)  The entire show is littered with all sorts of innuendos, sexual suggestions, and boob grabbing.  Lots and lots of boob grabbing.  What makes this such a refreshing brand of comedy is just how free the characters are.  Many characters play along with the whole ecchi thing rather than being all embarrassed and shy, which makes the situations not just a standard ecchi moment, but a rather funny one.  In addition, the show's perverted nature rolls with the show and to my knowledge, hasn't made the show any less quality than it is from my viewpoint.  That being said, the show does have many, and I mean MANY scenes like this (you can expect one every five minutes of watching this show.) and can get distracting and put people off due to its sheer amount, as well as sometimes its absurdity.  (Like the all-powerful stripping magic.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, this show was a very faithful adaptation to the manga that this was based on.  The pacing was decent enough so that the viewer wouldn't get left behind on anything that was going on, and the story while still harem-related, followed events that really didn't have to do with a generic harem show, making the show as a whole, surprisingly good.  But while the show itself proves to be good, it does lack in a lot of explanation at the end.  There are many questions that (unless you've read the manga) become left unanswered and really require this show to have a second season in order to continue the story, because this show ends on a cliffhanger that at the end of the day, doesn't please anyone.  (Cause really, the real story of Trinity seven only JUST started with the end of the last episode)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Harem with Plot   (you don't really see many of these.)\\n\r\n+  Good story telling\\n\r\n+  Decent pacing\\n\r\n+/-  Interesting concept of magic  (Can ruin viewing experience if you don't quite get it.)\\n\r\n+/-  Perverted comedy that works in conjunction with the show   (ruins viewing experience if you don't like ecchi\\n\r\n-   Cliffhanger ending\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8.11/10):  Now, onto the real high points of Trinity Seven, the characters.  \\n\\n\r\nKasuga Arata is the main protagonist/harem master of this series.  Now, what would we expect from a harem series from past experiences?  A guy with way too much luck having 3+ girls fall for him while being super nice and not noticing their feelings at all?  No!  Compared to many other harem protagonists, Arata is not a simple plot device, but rather has a personality of his own.  (Take that, Ichika.)  As something of a complete opposite to the normal harem protagonist, Arata has an extremely perverted personality, taking up any offers that the Trinity seven gives, and making any given perverted moment into a hilarious moment via monologue usually ending with \"Thanks for the Feast\"; not to mention, he is aware of the fact that some of the girls actually like him romantically.  As a result, Arata truly becomes a unique character because of how he reacts to different situations he's put in, as well as how much he breaks away from what we anime viewers know of the generic harem protagonist.  He's not afraid to try out something new in terms of magic (or girls) and he really shows motivation for the goal that he's put in front of himself.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have the Trinity Seven.  Since they all account for the title of best girl, I'll try and summarize them the best I can in a few short words with a couple side notes for some of them.\\n\\n\r\nLilith = Large chested tsundere that is a teacher and sort of the \"main girl\".  (stick in the mud)\\n\r\nArin = Kuudere girl that proclaims herself as Arata's wife\\n\r\nLevi = The ninja girl that is just as perverted as Arata is, making many suggestive suggestions.\\n\r\nYui = The big-chested loli Imouto character that has a crush on Arata.   (My personal favorite)\\n\r\nMira = The head of the disciplinary committee that's just a bit too strict. (Also a stick in the mud.)\\n\r\nAkio = The big sister character that often laughs at Arata's constant perverted anctics\\n\r\nLiese = The dark horse of the Trinity Seven with the personality of an alluring mistress.  (According to Arata, has the nicest legs.)\\n\\n\r\nThe trinity seven is the show's core characters, with the entire plot revolving around Arata associating with these seven girls.  What gives the show a plus, as well as a negative is character development.  Some of these girls do have some backstory given to them.  Why they are a member of the trinity seven, what are their motives, and who they are as a person.  As a negative, they don't really do this to many of the girls, leading to some of the girls being a bit fleshed out, while other still stay in their one-note, but still enjoyable personalities.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for side characters, the show has a wide host of different ones that get varying screentime, such as the Astil Codex Grimoire, the perverted headmaster, Arata's cousin Hijiri, and Selina.  These side characters for the most part are quite memorable.  They share similar traits to the main cast of being more unique and memorable than other characters previously seen before.  That being said, you don't really get to know TOO much about them, and they relatively stay in the role of providing conflict, or adding to the perverted moments of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  FANTASTIC Harem MC\\n\r\n+  Great Harem girls\\n\r\n+/-  Character development is uneven amongst characters\\n\r\n+/-  Side characters really only serve one of two purposes\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8.00/10 and 7.44/10):  The art for Trinity seven is done in a way that I feel really fits the show.  The show is drawn in a sort of darker gradient where the characters don't look as bright as other magic shows, but more as a more sinister way of expression, reflecting on the dark ideals and powers that the magic in this show really holds.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, character design is done relatively well, with the characters looking rather nice from scene to scene with little fluctuation between animated quality.  In addition, the magic circles used in this series are fantastically done with a great amount of detail done to them to make them aesthetically pleasing.  \\n\\n\r\nNow, Ecchi.  The Ecchi in this show is overdone, in simple sense.  Very often, you will see boobs.  You will see clothes literally disintegrate off of females, and you will see pantsu, sexy poses, and faces that make the characters look like that they're in heat.  But what makes the ecchi in those show so memorable is the fact that it just looks so natural.  There are no insane dramatic closeups on the characters boobs really any of the ecchi scenes, and because the anime doesn't go out of its way to completely plaster the screen with breasts, the ecchi honestly doesn't feel as distracting as it could've been.  (Ecchi is still VERY prominent, so beware.)\\n\\n\r\nAs for music, the show hosts a very electronic sounding soundtrack, with its opening being a good example of what the music is going to be like.  It's a very interesting genre of music to use for the series, and it certainly is quite memorable.  In addition, the show has three separate endings that all use the similar electronic sound to it, whilst having different feels and emotions for each one.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good animation that fits the show's style\\n\r\n+  Good music\\n\r\n+/-  Cleverly done ecchi  (Can still be distracting if you don't like ecchi)\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (9.89/10):  Yeah, I like this show, maybe too much might I add.  But I digress.  Trinity Seven is a perfect mix for someone like me.  It has plot, it has a great and very memorable main character, and oh so greatly done ecchi.  From the viewpoint someone who basically just watches harem, this is a great show.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nYes.  Very much so.  It combined every aspect of what I find in a good show in addition to the idea of harem.  A good first episode to hook in the viewer, a good and easy to follow plot with chronological events, and explanation for at least most of the plot while leaving a little bit of mystery.  The aesthetics were also very well done, and I congratulate the creators for making a show that looked both brooding and fun at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?\\n\\n\r\nFor one thing, it ended.  I want more trinity seven.  Aside from that, the show really didn't tie up any of the loose ends it made towards the end.  While the anime does follow the manga to the letter, the reality is the fact that, as a downfall, the anime's story is incomplete due to it following only about 30 or so chapters of the manga.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a harem lover like me and sick and tired of harem MC's, or would want to see a show that breaks everything you knew about harem shows, than this show is for you!  Until next time, Magic King Candidate Xadon, OUT!\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.85/10",

            "content": "Writing from a shipper's point of view.\r\nSTORY 9/10\r\nStory is centered around 8 characters. Kasuga, Arata and the trinity seven, mostly Arata's point of view in my opinion. He's out on a quest to get his cousin back after he destroys his home town. And his cousin (?) unknowingly doing so though. Because a circle of fate has chosen him to be a demon lord candidate. \r\nART 10/10 \r\nThe art is is amazing! I love every bit of it, follows the art of the manga exactly. There are only a couple of anime I've seen that copy the art style of the manga. So it getsa full 10.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 10/10\\n\r\nHigh quality sound, amazing songs. Both OPs are very nice and catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 8/10\\n\r\nMy favorite part of the review. At first the characters are all very cliche, but little by little as he gets to know each of them. They change for the better, each and every one of them have there own unique personality that you grow to love in these 12 episode. (Hopefully a season 2 (?) ) But what makes this MC so cool is sometimes he'll favor one of the girls then develop feelings for another. Kinda typical but he's acknowledging them one by one.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 10/10\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say here as all I gotta say is you MUST read the manga first and catch up on that. Before watching the anime, otherwise I'm 100% certain your opinion on it will just be a cool MC with a typical harem. The developments in the manga are something of a masterpiece. And the anime does that very well to incorporate that also.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 9/10\\n\r\nAs for who he gets with it's going to be a harem ending. Sadly... but the relations he develops with each one is an adventure on it's own. If more harems were like this people wouldn't hate harems so much. Great story, nice characters, amazing sounds, lovely art and that's all that needs to be said. Everyone has their own opinion so watch this with open arms.\\n",

            "content": "I came into this series with higher than average hope. The main attraction i had for the series was from small clips that showed the humorous chemistry between the protagonist and his harem. However, that all fell apart as the series progress.\r\nStory:\r\nMagical school setting and protagonist has to \"gain\" the trust of the \"trinity seven\", the strongest girls in the school, in order to attain his goal. Just your generic school setting with magic with 0 relation to school life. the story seem to revolve ONLY its protagonist and its harem, everyone and everywhere else is inconsequential. Fights make NO SENSE. You have a badmage with world ending abilities, she can destroy a area the size of a library all fights in the show happen in a ridiculously small area; within a room, corridor etc. You have MAGIC, you have SWORDS, you have GUNS yet you fight in a 5m radius? GTFO. In addition there are many decisions that doesnt make sense.\\n\r\n1) Why is does the teacher wear the same uniform as your students ? \\n\r\n2) The trinity 7 are the strongest 7 on a magic school, but why does everyone else seem to be just backdrop for the characters to shine? you might as well strip the series of its school setting and have it elsewhere if you're not gonna make use of the school setting.\\n\r\n3) There are other magical campus but all 7 of them are on the same campus? does the other campus have the set of strongest mage? NOPE because you're immediately told one was destroyed while the other was destroyed mid way in the story.\\n\r\n4) His home world got destroyed and all he care about was his childhood friend? what about his family or friends from school? was he born from a tree and knew NO ONE prior to his apocalypse? \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nCharacter designs are cute but dull in color, its like the world had a off palette lens around them. You get your usual loli, tsundere, yandere etc. These characters are introduced in 1-2 min and immediately they hit off like old friends and lovers. The loli literally falls in love with the main character in the first min after seeing each other naked. theres no development are explanation as to why she is so attracted to him, she just does. Only \"reason\" is  that he has the demon lord potential and that her fiance has to be the demon lord potential. 0 character development.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nNothing noteworthy about the sound production in the anime, generic at best. For a 12 ep anime, the studio seem to prioritize its budget on songs rather than flushing out the story or fight scenes. 4 ED songs, none of which is worth listening. The electro spoken words ED has to be the worse between the 2. The only good thing about the ED is the end of every episode, like you literally can stop watching once you hear \"You you can can choose choose your your de-desti(ti)na(na)tion(tion).\" because that song  brings out the worst of anime electronic music. The only saving grace from the series was Rie Kugimiya's voice acting which is mainly due to a personal bias.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nHumorous but typical harem anime. The anime creates its world with magic yet never address how it works. In fact it flips on itself on the use of \"grimoire\", everyone except the protagonist has a talking grimoire. Is it due to the fact that its some legendary artifact? is the magic from the grimoire or from its user? Final verdict: Not worth your time even if you're bored, i wished i was paid for watching this.",

            "content": "I don't typically get as engrossed in harems as much as other series. I find that although I will enjoy them, I'm not fully absorbed in the world and plot. However, there were a couple things about Trinity Seven that just made it feel different.\r\nFirst, we have the world in which the series takes place. This is usually one of the things that separates an individual harem from another. Trinity Seven had a unique magic system that was quite different even to someone who has read, watched, or played material from thousands of fantasy worlds. The world details started to interest me, which was thefirst thing that pushed Trinity Seven beyond a simple harem.\\n\\n\r\nNext, we have the characters. The MC was fundamentally different from the stereotypical harem MC. He isn't dense in any way I can think of, and therefore would be more easily described as a polar opposite. With the main heroines, you get a nice mix of new and interesting, along with some really well used cliches. More then once, the other heroines poke fun at the tsunderes and clearly emphasize the important personality aspects of each character (\"Oh, so I see you have entered dere mode!\"). Some of the characters even have complex relations with other characters that allow us to see another side of them. A clear example is seen when Mira explains her relationship with Akio.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, alongside these key factors, we are also provided with some small extras. Trinity Seven also included one of my favourite OPs of the Fall 2014 season, and some really humourous scenes and quotes that I will remember long after finishing the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found this series to be very well done. It stands out in the world of harems, which is quite a feat on it's own.",

            "content": "Finally finished all 12 episodes. Now I can review it!\r\nDespite how I enjoyed so very much, I have to give this anime some tough love.\r\nHere we go:\r\nSTORY:\r\nIn the first few episodes of the anime, it jumped around like nobody's business! Not as bad or as far as Baccano, so be at ease, but it was there and can confuse viewers. It leaps from and goes back to different points in time. Not like a flashback, but a rearranging of scenes.\r\nInstead of getting from A to B, you see part of B at first, go back to A to explain B, then jump back to B.Those of you who weren't caught up in the humor of the anime definitely raised an eyebrow.\\n\r\nThe start of the story itself was rushed and generic to a degree, but afterwards you can feel how the episodes pretty much felt like fillers before leading up to a final battle and ending of the series. The humor, characters, and ecchi scenes held me over to a degree, but I had a nagging feeling in the back of my head saying things like, \"When are we going to get on with the rest of the story?\" I hate to say I felt that form an anime I had fun with, but it's the truth.\\n\r\nThe anime can easily be compared to a twinkie with chocolate chips. You're wading through the fluff and filler, in order to reach the meaningful progression (the chocolate chips).\\n\\n\r\nNow for the anime played out. Oh god, how can I explain it so you can understand what's going on.\\n\r\nWe start off with our main character, Kasuga, Arata, waking up from a dream foretelling the viewers that he and a mystery girl will struggle to reach one another but can't. And before the two can grasp each others hands, he wakes up to find himself grasping said mystery girl's breast. \\n\r\nAfter the usual morning skit with the mystery girl, Hijiri Kasuga, and showing off how close the two cousins are, they are off to school. Along the way, theirs another mystery girl who warns him and threatens to kill him.\\n\r\nAside from the death threat, the story seems to be come off as the usual anime in a town. But during the schools break time, our main character notices that the sun is black and misty, and his cousin turned out to be a fake after some seductive and creepy words as she straddled him! At this time, the death threat mystery girl appears, and explains that the world around him was \"created\" by our main character Arata. Once Arata remembers that the real Hijiri vanished right before him, and the fake Hijiri informs him that the real Hijiri is still alive, he immediately is able to get into a Magic Academy because wants to become a mage so he can learn how to get his cousin back.\\n\r\nThat's the jest of it, I left out some details but nothing you can't watch for yourself. It turns and twists, but I'll leave that for you guys to happen upon.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nIt combines a 3D environment, with 2D animation. I found this combination charming, and the inside of the Magic Academy to have interesting designs. But in some cases it was puzzling to look at. For example not in all cases but in some cases where the 2D Characters would walk along the 3D ground, it would make the 3D environment seem out of place. I quickly got used to it though, and it throw me off when action scenes came around.\\n\r\nThe characters design seemed to try and give a unique look to people, but the people looked d a bit off at first. Such as an oval shape glare at the bottom of the eyes of all characters. It made me think that quite a few people were watery or teary eyed, but that was just part of the design.\\n\r\nI know how hard it is to apply something new to anime in regard to design, as viewers may want more of the same, so I commend the series for approaching art in its own way.\\n\r\nThe animation never seemed to miss a beat. It surprisingly kept up with the frames of the opening themes animation. Great detail and attention their.\\n\r\nSurprisingly enough, the characters who were well endowed didn't have breasts, butts, or legs shining through clothing, or eating the clothing. The shining was saved and given in doses along side fanservice. I commend any anime who knows when to hold back on everything being oiled up for the sake of eye candy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\\n\r\nI loved the opening theme, but it took me sometime to get used to the closing themes. It's all good though, great choices in songs.\\n\r\nThe regular music that played throughout the anime was refreshing and imersing. It had tracks that hinted techno, orchestra/piano/stringed instruments, or just a combination of the two. And I'm a sucker for classical music that plays well with animation.\\n\r\nIt had interesting and cool sound effects for spells being cased and used, and great voice acting from memorable voices. I think I recognized Arata's voice actor as the same person who played as Kirito from SAO.\\n\r\nWith pleasant surprises every, and good immersion, this anime isn't lacking in sound.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing I noticed, is how our main character is very lively. He copes well with just about all situations and jokes from the characters around him, his voice actor made him instantly loveable and memorable. Just like the headmaster of the academy.\\n\r\nNot all the girls are fodder that fall in love for the main character after an episode or three, they have their own personalities, opinions, and reactions to the main character! I was floored by this, but not so much to not realize how generic some of them were, ok?\\n\r\nIt's hard to not call them generic when there's the easily embarrassed sex symbol, the monotone girl who claims the main character as her husband, the big breasted Loli who claims the main character as her Onii-san, the TWINS with one who acts like the biggest fan/journalist and one showing off her tits and her intentions in the most sexual way she can, and the girl who's judgmental of the main character until she's forced to get to know him.\\n\r\nThe only unique girls I came across, was the rare rough neck girl who's tall and strong enough to break walls, who makes jokes, and doesn't act seductively AT ALL.\\n\r\nAnd the seductive ninja girl who makes sexy jokes with only a few of the main girls, and the main character.\\n\r\nBut with all this said, these characters make the anime fun and rewatchable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere's hardly anything I didn't enjoy from the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe bold main character who's a refreshing breeze in this anime world led by either either cry babies, accidental perverts who get their butts kicked left and right, or dopey goof-balls.\\n\r\nA harem that feels alive, and not slaves to the plot.\\n\r\nThe fanservice, and action.\\n\r\nIt's like an abridged parody, how hilarious this anime is.\\n\r\nBut how generic, and lacking it is when it comes to story progression, is a painful blister that hurts when touched. Even if it only has 12 episodes to introduce 7 main characters to a MAIN-main character.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\\n\r\nWith tough love, I give Trinity Seven:\\n\r\nA 6 out of 10.\\n\r\nIt's a gosh darn waste! The story doesn't suck, it's just the fluff standing between me and meaningful story progression.\\n\r\n\"I would get you there, but let's go here and work our way to where you want to be.\" \"I'll give you the information you're looking for, but... listen to me sing on stage, then buy me a drink.\"\\n\r\nI don't like having to wait for the story to continue. I had a wonderful time getting to where I needed to be over time instead of just getting their quickly, I love your song and I don't mind buying you a drink, but I can only sit and take so many detours and listen to so many songs so many times before it feels like I'm playing a waiting game.\\n\r\nMaybe the series needed to save up in order to make a 24 episode series. Because it's not like I want things taken out of the anime. Instead, I wanted story progression added into it. Balance out the chocolate chips with the fluff and cream. Make a kick butt twinkie anime. A twinkie anime that's made with everything enriched, and not with something set aside to hail the mindless hordes only in it for the fanservice.\\n\r\nThat said, this anime is a good buy. Granted the makers look up feed back, and improve any other work they put out. I'd love to go to find other people and talk about the anime, or look up fan art. Because the enjoyment is there, the anticipation is there, but not the overall anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd until it is, let's meet up at another review.",

I've never really been interested in harems, but this show had me intrigued. The reason i originally started watching it is because of the art style. It's very unique and i thought it looked pretty awesome. The plot of the story is pretty good, although not great. The show seems to focus on the character interactions more than the actual plot. I like the characters, especially Arata, seeing as he takes charge and isn't afraid to do what he wants. He's pervy and there's a lotof fan service throughout the series. You have some of the typical anime characters like the tsundere and the loli. The fight scenes are good, better than i expected. Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable anime. I've got my fingers crossed they make a season two.",

            "content": "I thank myself for choosing this anime. Trinity Seven looked unfamiliar and not-so interesting for me to watch at first, and also, I hadn't known much about the studio producing the anime, Seven Arcs. But I was impressed by what it has shown for the past 12 weeks.\r\nLooking at the poster, you would known that the anime is going to be a harem in a magic school. While we already encountered many magic (and sometimes having a lot of female characters in the cast) anime, this is definitely going to stand out among the rest this year. The story started in a typical day forArata, living with his childhood friend Hijiri. With the sudden appearance of a magician, later a while, he found out something weird. He learnt that the town they lived was destroyed by a phenomenon and so a grimorie given by Hijiri before disappearing reconstructed it. The magician, Lilith, then invites him to Royal Biblia Academy where he has a goal to save Hijiri. But to do, he has to become a demon lord and gather the Trinity Seven.\\n\\n\r\nSure, big words and seemingly generic story. But the way the anime executes the setting is great. Observing the timeline of this story is like piecing to make a puzzle. As the story progresses, more characters are introduced and usually they take their time in the episode to explain the audience about themselves and perhaps about this magic they possess. Yet again, it has a lot of explanation which you can either get confused of or forget along the way. Eventually, you can get some idea of it unless you are watching it for the fan-service. Each mage has magic based on their thema (theme) and basically they are different types of magic spells to their own desire.\\n\\n\r\nHow the story closes leaves a sweet feeling. I really don't know how the story can continue, since I felt that everything is so clear for me already.\\n\\n\r\nCramming many different types of genres into one story can sometimes be a trainwreck. Trinity Seven tries to balance several of them - action, comedy, ecchi, fantasy, romance and harem. That's a lot. The comedy is funny at times through characters' interaction. There's some action included with battles between the opponents. The fan-service is definitely too much and sometimes repetitive, and it isn't as much as I expected when watching the first episode. The romance and harem aspects aren't fully explored, but there are crushes towards Arata from the characters. Indeed, some relationships develop along the way. In the end, as you can see, it's really hard to maintain, but I don't think this has ruined the anime at all. Of course, this depends on whether you like these genres, or you expected them.\\n\\n\r\nThe Trinity Seven team is an interesting set of characters. It takes time to introduce them one by one and I say that I'm satisfied how the story introduces the characters well with whatever character they have in themselves. I heard that they are based of the \"Seven Deadly Sins\", although I don't recall it being mentioned in the anime. Still, it is a nice linkage.\\n\\n\r\nIt's true to say that you can expect some harem tropes in them. And unfortunately the anime didn't go perfectly in this section. Sure, I said they are an interesting bunch, but that depends on themselves. The girls are interesting because of how they act, but a very few has good development because of the interactions between themselves and Arata. Sometimes, a few of the them looked left out from the rest. But nevertheless, some of the characters also display some different emotions too.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Arata himself, I must give extra points for his attitude. Never-ever dense, this main character knows how to interact, be it in a fan-service or an intense battle situation. From start to end, he knows what he wanted and how to achieve it. Thanks to the girls that helped along the way, he has a lovely development I like to see. Sure, he has his cute side as well - once in a while he feels embarrassed, and as well as having some deep thoughts over things like Hijiri.\\n\\n\r\nThe opponents against the Trinity Seven are cool but doesn't have a wide character and development, possibly due to the time of their introduction. \\n\\n\r\nTrinity Seven's art isn't quite unique. The colour palette used for everything looks dull in some places. While some sceneries look great, the others look plain and boring. It is due to the fact that there's not much lively atmosphere in many of these sceneries. There are CGI used in some interior sceneries for the movement of the camera panning, and I feel it feels nice with the 2D moving animation most of the time. The visual effects are great. Magic circles, sparks flying and explosions feel so well-done. Fighting animation seems fair enough, but yet again there's not really much fight scenes that involve punching. Some battles have this nice impact that leaves a nice finish.\\n\r\nThe character designs are weirdly good. Their body shapes are fine but I feel that the character designs in the manga looked better, maybe because of more realistic details. Some faces might look weird but you will get used to it soon. The facial expressions vary and even from a multi-genre anime, I like how they show the feelings of the characters, either comedic or not.\\n\\n\r\nZAQ decides to sing another single. If you know her by now, most of the songs have a different feel and style. Seven Doors has an epic rock feel that gets into the groove of Trinity Seven, along with her great voice that matches along the instrumental. It's definitely one that can stand out from the rest of openings in this season. Meanwhile, the anime has four songs of different styles as well. Each are sung by a pair of voice actresses that their characters are well-related. Overall, I enjoyed all but one but I love to see a nice variety of this.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music has a nice take over the battle scenes, generating some hype and action that blends well. Other scenes are fine as well. Besides, its main genre focus is techno (electronic) music. The voice acting is done well, it helps to match whatever the character is acting or saying. I love to see some voice actresses acting out of their usual acting. One example is Yumi that voices Takane from iDOLM@STER, voices Lilith. And we all know who voiced Arata. Yoshitsugu is very famous and voiced many different characters, but it's good that he keeps it to Arata's character for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI really can't say if this is a recommendation for everyone, but I personally enjoyed whatever Trinity Seven has offered. There may have been a lot of explanation to go through or maybe you can't stand a lot of fan-service, but I guess I'm happy to see that this generic setting is executed well.\\n\\n\r\nI don't mind continuing the manga after the anime, and I don't know if we're getting a second season or not. There's still an OVA, so it's worth catching it for a fix of never-dense main character with his interestingly weird harem.",

            "content": "TLDR: Generic magic fantasy story with a harem and fan service\r\nTrinity seven's story was quite confusing and boring. It started off for a few episodes where I didn't know what was happening because I didn't care. T7's premise was generic fantasy where our MC finds power and has to save the world. Where it is different is he has a harem and you can't really tell what he's trying to save, except for his cousin. The magic system was original, but uninteresting, and the names for everything are the generic fantasy names that you see in many pieces. You have your Norse, Biblical, and othermythological names that you see everywhere. Which is fine, usually; however, after so many pieces of entertainment have used it, original concepts go a long way. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation quality is a bit above average for today's standard. It excels during fights and is decent the rest of the time. There is a lot of fanservice. MC is a \"lucky pervert\" and see's, touches, and fantasizes about all of the girls' boobs. You can't go an episode without characters awkwardly falling on top of each other; either exposing their crotch or boobs. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound quality is above average. The OP was really catchy and the ED's were ok. The BGM was very fitting for each scene and I noticed it a lot of the time. I found it exceptional. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were your run of the mill Tsundere, Kuudere, Dandere, etc. Liese best girl, don't you deny that. Each and every girl was nice to look at ;) and had somethings that were interesting about them. My only complaint was the shit MC who looks so very stupid. Every time I look at Arata, he seems a bit off, somehow. Also, he is  quite the average pervert and isn't really interesting. He has his moments, but wasn't a good MC. Characters are a bit too generic, overall, so 4/10 seems appropriate. \\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment for this skyrocketed about halfway through the series. This turned from a 3/10, overall to a 7/10 over the course of the second half. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, T7 isn't spectacular. It was fun to watch, but hard to get into. I wasn't expecting much going in; nevertheless, after watching the show, I was still thoroughly entertained. 54/100",

While at the start, i felt this just got in the way, it did (unfortunately) turn out to be slightly relevant during some later episodes.\r\nStill i WOULDN'T say that \"it's all about Harem\", as there really is aserious story to be told. I loved the plot twists, the suspense, and the realizations. Though, it's all presented in an \"immediate scope\" - meaning that there's no time for any additional character development, or details that could make it easier to become better acquainted with the Trinity Seven. \\n\r\nIt seems that at times, particularly near the start - they tried to rectify this, with a slower pace: which did help induce a definite sense of wonder and mystery when i begun watching.\\n\\n\r\nThough, with the added pressure of only 12 episodes to tell a story worthy of a much larger anime title, like a kid drawing \"bubble letters\", it seemed that after the half way mark, they were running out of space, and so a significant amount of content had to be lost in order to convey the bare bones of the story.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're planning to watch as a thriller, then this really does do action, suspense, AND PLOT TWISTS!\\n\r\n - rather well.

And he tries to get on the good side of the 7 strongest mages; the Trinity Seven, who are all girls in order to get back his cousin who disappeared due to some magic (breakdown phenomenon).\r\nArt 7/10:\r\nWhat's wrong with thoseeyes?

Yeah, so it's got good animation and character design.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10:\\n\r\nThe protagonist is an ultra pervert whose most powerful magic is ripping apart everyone's clothes. Other than that, the trinity seven are quite good. They don't go into the depth of each character, just their powers and there affection for the perverted demon lord aka the protagonist.The bad guys, well, they just pop out of nowhere and the last 2 episodes deal with the real antagonist's of the series. And what's their story, sorry, but that's not told.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10:\\n\r\nThis series starts out quite good but soon I was just watching it to complete it. Power ups come in an instant.

He's also unapologetically perverted, and it's quite refreshing to see him handle the inevitable ecchi situations with humor and honesty instead of stuttered apologies.\r\nMost of the girls are rather likeable as well, from the prudishand easily-embarrassed Lilith (a great target for Arata's teasing) to the mischievous and confident Levi, who developed a certain camaraderie with the MC and even goes along with his perverted jokes. Their interactions with Arata and each other are usually quite entertaining. Violent tsundere tendencies, while present in one or two characters, are thankfully toned down. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Trinity Seven is an otherwise average harem carried by an awesome male lead and charming female characters.",

One thing that I realized I liked was that he wasn't as overpowered as any other anime would have made him.\r\n- Aiko: One of the supporting characters in the Trinity Seven. There was something different about her from other female characters of any anime. She stood out to me the most (besides MC).\r\nCons:\r\n- Horrible plot development. Just so messy.I almost dropped it becauseit bothered me that much.\\n\r\n- The amount of fan service. I do like a bit myself, but there comes a point where it's too much. Trinity Seven goes past that point.\\n\r\n- Every female character, other than Aiko.\\n\r\n- Character development was atrocious. Nothing was explained well. For example, what are any of the \"processes\"? What actual powers do the grimories have? \\n\r\n- Hijiri: To not include any spoilers, I won't describe much. As I watched, I just wanted to say what the actual F? If you decide to watch the anime, you'll understand.\\n\\n\r\nI will say that this anime is on the lower end of my spectrum of choice. I think that the story would have been executed better in a longer season.",

            "content": "Trinity Seven ~8~\r\nSo ~ the end of this anime season is approaching and I find myself, once again, trying to come up with reasonable ratings for the various anime which I followed over the past months.\r\n~ Unsafeman121 Dec 2014\r\n~ Plot ~\r\n~8~\r\nVery intriguing and at first slightly mysterious, the plot makes you keep wanting some more. There many times at which the episode ended and I just wanted to be able to continue watching. It seems fairly well thought out and the happenings all seem to fit into the world well. There are times when parts could be explained a little bit more clearly, such asin the Library section, however I feel that this did not detract from my enjoyment of the anime. Each \"section\" feels like it brings everything a little bit closer together and it is very satisfying to watch. There are very few times where I felt there wasn't progress in the plot, and yet still a good amount of character development is achieved. The combination of these two make this anime a worthy watch.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~\\n\r\n~7~\\n\r\nAlthough I did not particularly enjoy either the OP or ED of this anime, I felt that the voices were VERY well suited to the characters, everything fits well and it certainly helps the ease with which one can watch this anime. I didn't find any issue with any background music that played in the anime, and wasn't distracted by any of it, but in the same regard, it didn't blow me away as anything incredible.\\n\\n\r\n~Visuals~\\n\r\n~8~\\n\r\nPersonally, I enjoyed the visuals, I felt as if they were above average for an anime of this type and I was sometimes impressed by certain backgrounds or settings. You can tell that effort has been put in to make this anime look great, and it is another reason for which this anime is so enjoyable to watch. It is well detailed and there are few things about it which I would change if I had the choice. (You can tell they put lots of effort into the fanservice ;) )\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~\\n\r\n~9~\\n\r\nOne of the strong points about this anime, the characters are all very likable and well made. There is sufficient character development (for an anime of this length), that you feel for some of the characters and get to know them a little bit more than in some other anime. There is an incredible mix of characters, and each on adds to the feeling of the anime. They each have their traits and they all seem to function well together in terms of interaction. It doesn't feel like any of the characters make any of the others redundant. The way in which they can synergise their powers is clever and I feel that this was a slightly more unique aspect.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\r\n~9~\\n\r\nThis is one of the anime which I have thoroughly enjoyed. There are several reasons for this, though obviously as I don't want to give any spoilers, I will not mention many of them. A lot of they enjoyment I feel, came from the very well written script and the interactions of the characters with each other and their relationships.\\n\\n\r\n~Overall~\\n\r\n~8~ \\n\r\n\"This was more enjoyable to watch than the average anime, would recommend to others.\"\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, this anime is above par and one that I would recommend to people, even if they hadn't specifically mentioned the title themselves. There is a great mix of characters, their voices fit and the plot is great. This is one of the better anime out of the ones I have been watching this season (4th release date of 2014)\\n\\n\r\nFor those who are interested ~ Ranking Progression:\\n\r\nThis is where I show the changes (if any) in my overall rating as the anime progressed, I review my ratings every 4 episodes ~ though if one does stand out for me I will also mention it.\\n\\n\r\nE01: 7\\n\r\nE04: 7\\n\r\nE08: 7\\n\r\nE09: 8 (Rated up 1)\\n\r\nE12: 8",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nWhere most people worry about what to get their family members for the holidays, others are more concerned about the actual state of the world. Global warming, earthquakes, and solar flares are all major issues that scientists and those worried about the Earth's future are thinking about daily. They wonder if these types of disasters can be avoided, to prevent the destruction of the place we call home. Whether or not anything is ultimately preventable is certainly a courageous endeavor, often needing help from the many and not the few. This sets the stage for Trinity Seven, astage filled with breasts, harems, and not much more.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nTrinity Seven begins with Arata, a young man who loses his cousin Hijiri to a \"collapse phenomenon,\" prompting him to leave with Lilith to a magical high school where he discovers he is the next \"demon lord candidate.\"\\n\\n\r\nTrinity Seven is classified as a harem, and it does this portion of the show well. When it is focusing on the fan-service and sexualization, it is rife with opportunities to show the girls off being as cute and beautiful as possible. A lot of this is owed to their varying personalities, antics, and general adoration of Arata. The anime attempts to switch up the pairings where it can, allowing the girls to flaunt their stuff as much as possible. On the whole, this gives the series a competent amount of ecchi content.\\n\\n\r\nIt all goes downhill when it is not focusing on this side, however. One of Trinity Seven's largest issues comes from the cast itself. The anime is constantly throwing out new characters from start to finish. This is not an exaggeration; literally until the final episode, new characters are being shown. Being an entirely character driven show, one would think that such an endeavor would be acceptable. But it doesn't work. As more and more characters are brought in, two more problems arise. The older characters are not given enough screen-time, causing them all to lack development and caring towards them needed by the audience. At the same time, the newer characters, given their later and later introductions, suffer the same fate. No character is given enough time to be properly explored, making the cast become props to ogle at rather than well-defined people. It's a vicious cycle that persists throughout the entire season, bringing about an unsavory amount of chaos.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw comes from the plot itself. Much of what occurs is completely nonsensical in nature due to the exorbitant amount of terminology the anime throws at the audience. \"Archives,\" \"Themas,\" and other foreign words are tossed around as if the audience is supposed to simply understand why they are being used or where they originate. The anime never delves into any sort of world-building, merely saying phrases in passing or nonchalantly talking about how certain aspects of their magic work. There is no pretext, context, or subtext for anything that goes on. Both the overall arc and sub-plots contain this problem, throwing the entire experience into disarray.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nGenerally less than stellar, Trinity Seven adopts rather awkward techniques for both its art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nBeginning with the art style, the characters are typically set to CGI backgrounds. This allows them to stand out more noticeably when compared to other anime, mainly because of the jarring juxtaposition of 3D and 2D elements. The anime looks better when it is not using such a trick, but even then, the unvarying amount of locations that are visited provides little in the way of eye-candy.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this candy is found with (once again) the best part of the show: the girls and their character designs. Ranging from elegant to slutty, bodacious to simple, the girls all maintain the same style but differ when it comes to overall looks, faces, hair, outfits, etc. They're all attractive in their own respective ways, making the designs pleasing to see on a regular basis.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual animation, though, is sorely missing. Character movements are often kept to a minimum and many shots consist of only one character at a time. The most notable drop in animation comes from the \"fight\" scenes. They are meant to be small duels or skirmishes, but they are never really depicted as such. Quick cuts, simple attacks, and more often than not refusing to show the action itself demonstrates just how little animation there really is.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nBeing a harem, Trinity Seven contains a large main cast. More specifically, and perhaps obviously, there are seven young women who take the spotlight. I'll stick to talking about Arata and my favorite four.\\n\\n\r\nAs a main character, Arata is actually not immensely dense. Perverse and funny, he allows the Trinity Seven themselves to shine as much as possible. Determined to see his cousin once more, he goes to great lengths to accomplish the goals he sets for himself. As a new demon lord candidate, he is able to control magic as he wills. It's this and his all-around likability that causes the girls to flock to him, despite his affinity for all things debauched.\\n\\n\r\nActing as the head of the defense department, Mira is a shorter woman who does not tolerate any form of impure thoughts or actions. Extremely shy yet demanding, she usually butts heads with Arata due to their opposite, base ideals. Her strong suit is being capable of reflecting or disabling any form of magic. Her highly defensive combat abilities also manifest in her personality, making her difficult to approach let alone talk to. However, the more time she spends with Arata, the further her shell cracks, revealing a more comfortable and caring friend.\\n\\n\r\nLiese is a succubus first and magic-user second. Relying almost entirely on her well-endowed assets, she utilizes her sex appeal to its fullest potential. Her playful nature causes her to invade people's privacy regularly. She has no qualms making others feel uncomfortable, since she is so content with her own body and her sexuality. To aid her in this process, she is able to bend time to her will. Liese starts off as a tough antagonist, aiming to become the next \"demon lord\" before Arata. But due to his affable personality, she transitions from difficult foe to treasured companion, presenting an argument to the saying, \"time heals all wounds.\"\\n\\n\r\nYui is a strange girl, to say the least. She exists within two separate dimensions at the same time: one in the real world and another in a dream-like state. The former is incredibly happy, carefree, and quick to call Arata \"Onii-san\" whenever she is given the chance. Her dream-self is quiet and calm, producing an aura of elegance that the rest of the girls do not own. Her magic takes on a supportive role, boosting the power of those around her. Being the first of the Trinity Seven that brings Arata hardship to \"capture,\" when she is ultimately saved, her supportive attitude shines through, making her an extremely wonderful addition to the cast.\\n\\n\r\nTechnically the poster-girl for the show, Lilith is Arata's mentor and first of the girls to give her trust. Easily embarrassed, sincere, and willing to guide people down the right path, she is most often found looking after Arata. Her beauty is unrivaled, and so are her skills as a professor. She is at maximum cuteness when she is blushing after being teased or hearing/seeing Arata say/do something slightly perverted. Her abilities take the form of handheld weapons -- guns -- that shoot out magic with high speed and intensity. While she incessantly yells at Arata for his continuous behavior, deep down, like the guns she wields, her emotions and feelings for him are incredibly strong and unyielding.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with the other three (Levi, Arin, and Akio), and a few of the other side cast, each of them have their own descriptions and a connection between their personality and the skills they have. While the entire cast is neither fleshed out nor too memorable, there is bound to be someone here for everyone to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP for the anime is actually quite good. The beginning part with the hard guitar and choir-like singing starts the piece off strong. The middle section follows suit, with guitar, drums, and vocals working well in unison. The halfway point, with the \"falling\" effects in the singing and drums causes one to bob their head to the beat. Just the nice amount of variety from the piece makes it stand out from the pact.\\n\\n\r\nYou may be able to choose the destination, but you shouldn't choose the first ED. It's a mess of singing and instruments that is not pleasant to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nThe second ED takes a slightly slower approach that works miles better than the first. Its float-y feel and \"shavadava,\" alongside the more onomatopoeia vocals, make it a fun song to hear, coinciding with the stronger parts of the anime. It is Arguably the best of the EDs.\\n\\n\r\nED number three goes back to being quick, and subsequently back to being bad. It's a rather strange song, containing a piano melody and both fast and higher singing that don't work well together.\\n\\n\r\nThe final ED is the worst of the bunch. Nothing attributed to the song seems to flow, creating an even worse amalgamation than what the first ending piece offered. The techno background beat and mid-range vocals create an awkward arrangement that doesn't fit well with the anime, as well as making it rather forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack mostly consists of ambient pieces filled with violins and darker tones that fit the more \"evil\" vibe the show contains during the more serious portions. However, none of the tracks are noteworthy.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting within the anime is average, with no notable performances to be had.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to an anime like this, it prioritizes boobs, butts, and sex first with story and characters coming in at a distant second. In that regard, the show satiates one's need for good fan-service. Seeing Lilith nearly naked, having Arin and Yui cuddling with their \"husband,\" and watching Liese's attempts at seduction made me quite the happy man.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the anime tried to make the action and plot its focus, I really just wanted them to go back to the comedy and the harem elements that it was doing so well at. And as the series progressed, it started fixating its eyes on its weakest parts more and more, making the experience less fun the further along it went.\\n\\n\r\nFor what it's worth, Trinity Seven tried to be more than just a run-of-the-mill harem. But its inability to balance the characters, its rather awful narrative (even among the genre), and strange decisions in regards to animation and music make the entire package less than average.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, good fan-service, too many characters, terrible world-building\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, jarring 2D/3D mix, nice character designs, little animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Arata, Mira, Liese, Yui, and Lilith are okay, with someone for everyone\\n\\n\r\nSound: Bad, good OP, bad EDs, okay soundtrack, average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, fun to watch only when the women are the focus\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 3/10",

            "content": "A \"Harem\" is a magical word used to describe every straight male's ideal reality in which every single girl he comes in counter with wants to hop on his yaoi stick. The harem is typically courted by a dense male lead and at least five girls -- each with a different hair color than the others. This male lead will then become involved in at least three scenarios (Per episode) in which he accidentally touches one of these girls in one of their private areas and thus receives a slap in the face, followed by blushing and an occasional punch that defies the laws ofphysics and sends him skyrocketing across the galaxy. Trinity Seven is an atypical representation concerning this definition of \"Harem\".\\n\\n\r\nKasuga Arata (Only dude pictured above) isn't your typical dense \"Omg I have no idea you want to bang me\" protagonist. This is where a lot of the charm Trinity Seven has to offer comes into play. We meet him as the world he resides in is being torn to shreds, ultimately ending humanity. In his final moments, his cousin hands him a necklace/grimoire-thingy (Before falling into a crevice opening up in the world) which contains a magical entity that will allow him to essentially re-shape the world on a journey to find that cousin. However, in order to do that, he must become acquainted with the \"Trinity Seven\" which is the name given to the seven magus females that all want to swallow his mana.\\n\\n\r\nBut the cool thing about Trinity Seven is that it never really feels dull. It's predictable in a good way, which sounds weird at first -- but makes sense in context. You won't grow to hate the main character, which is a common flaw that harems typically encounter as they progress. This all culminates in one of the most surprisingly entertaining shows to come out of Fall 2014. In order to better illustrate this, let me break it up into a few key components.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\r\nTrinity Seven sports a soundtrack that is infused with hard-rock, techno, funk, and some sweet-ass bass lines. It's actually quite good when listening to it even out of context. The music never seems like it's \"Just there\". It serves as a good sidekick during fight scenes and allows the audience to keep their eyes fixed to the screen without feeling distracted or irritated by overly-obnoxious music typically prevalent in action-sequences. On top of this, the opening song is pretty damn catchy and becomes an essential part of every episode that almost anyone would look forward to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nThe best part of this show really lies within the characters. Each one carries their own distinct personality and complements the protagonist almost perfectly. In harems, another common problem is how viewers will basically choose one girl that they want the protagonist to end up with. This results in hate bubbling up for the other girls and eventually ends up on some message-board like /a/ where everyone argues about who is \"Best girl\". In Trinity Seven, it's actually pretty hard to decide who you want to \"Win\". To be perfectly honest, I still don't know which girl would make the best pairing with Arata. Maybe Mira. Or Lilith. I don't know, just let me keep Levi to myself. Anyway, it's this aspect that makes the characters enjoyable all-around. One thing I would have liked to see though, would be character development for anyone outside of Arata. Everyone seems kind of snug within their own niche, not ever changing from who they already are.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nAt first, I didn't know how I felt about the visuals that were put in front of me in Trinity Seven. Three episodes later, I adored it. There was just that period of \"Mehhhh\" time it took for me to feel it out. I felt the same way about Madoka Magica when I watched that, and now I think it's one of the most beautiful shows I've ever seen. Trinity Seven shouldn't really be compared to Madoka outside of the \"Girls with magical powers\" thing, but you probably understand what I mean when I say you might not like it at first. Just give it some time. I promise. In addition to the general artwork, character designs were unique and impressive. It appeared as if the artists actually put love and care into each one, treating them more as actual characters than curious teenage girls waiting to be taken advantage of after meeting a boy for the first time. Each one was extremely different from the others (Apart from Lieselotte and Selina, but you know...twins) and I never got tired of seeing them.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nTrinity Seven has a solid story. Is it great? No, not by any means. But it's more than you'll normally find in this genre. The protagonist actually has a goal that he is constantly moving toward. The side-characters try their best to aid him in this endeavor. It just works out. There are periods where things seem bleak, but those periods are then counteracted by others that seem hopeful. Each episode actually goes somewhere, which is a feat that so many shows struggle with nowadays. The series even ends on a note that will allow for another season or two if season one sells well enough. Hell, I might even pick up manga one day if I get bored enough. Once again, solid storytelling by writer, Kenji Saitou, and director, Hiroshi Nishikiori.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Trinity Seven is a very well-rounded harem/comedy with a few fight scenes thrown in for action and a story that actually goes somewhere. If you are a fan of fan-service, character design, or laughing, I would give it a try. It definitely surprised me and became an easy favorite for the year of 2014.",

This one is a bit different, with the main character being more open and honest, and all the women bashing him in a more realistic manner it brings a more refreshing feel to this anime that is rarely seen. Story leaves out some info on what is going on from the get go. And your left to piece it together throughout the majority of the anime. With the plot left on the stove tothicken as you go it keeps you intrigued as to why exactly everything is going on and by the end found myself wanting more. I would definitely appreciate a 2nd season.",

            "content": "In my short time of reviewing anime, I've covered quite a few different types of harems. I've done dramatic harems, reverse harems, and even harems that didn't start out as harems. However, I realized recently that I've never done a review for just a regular old comedic harem, so I decided to pick one up for this season. Upon finishing the series, I realized that everything I want to say about it could pretty much apply to every other comedic harem I've seen. So, aside from the specific anime I'm covering today, consider this asan appropriate substitute review for any other generic comedic harem you can think of (Rosario + Vampire, Highschool DxD, Infinite Stratos, Maken-ki!, etc.), as I rattle off the list of traits that this genre keeps using over and over and over again to make itself as bland and marketable as possible.\\n\\n\r\n1. Fantasy setting or heavy fantasy elements, usually involving magic\\n\r\n          While more traditional and realistic settings may have worked back in the heyday of harems like Love Hina, the incorporation of fantasy elements serves as a replacement for actually making the viewer believe that this type of romantic setup could occur in the first place. Additionally, the use of magic creates a plethora of possibilities for getting the female characters into situations of a lewd and nearly-naked nature, with very minimal effort on the part of the writer. For Trinity Seven, we end up with one of Arata's main powers being the ability to make people's clothes disappear, providing plenty of fan service fun.\\n\\n\r\n2. Story still manages to take place in a high school of some kind\\n\r\n          I'm not sure what the exact percentage is of anime that take place in high school, but I'm going to assume it's a relatively high number, and within the harem genre the reason for that is very simple: it attracts viewers who are currently in high school. Additionally, with Trinity Seven, we get bonus points added for the high school being an all-girls school (while it's never explicitly stated that this is the case, no other male students seem to appear in this school). This further allows for Arata to be given free reign over whatever love interest the series decides to throw in for our enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\n3. Actual story and magic lore is incredibly convoluted and pointless\\n\r\n          For obvious reasons, writers can't just get away with writing absolutely nothing but fan service moments, so of course there has to be some kind of story. However, writing an actual story would make it too difficult for the viewers to focus on those wonderfully-animated breasts you just shoved into frame [heavy-handed sarcasm], so the plot needs to be flimsy, shallow, and easily tradable with any other generic plot. Every magic term in Trinity Seven is practically thrown in your face one after another with little more than a one-sentence description of what it actually does. That didn't really matter though, because I couldn't even count the times where I just flat-out looked away from the screen for a minute or so and then turned back to realize that absolutely nothing has happened other than some more flashy magic terminology and a panty shot.\\n\\n\r\n4. Random climactic battle at the end of the series\\n\r\n          ...yeah that's just kind of a thing I guess. I suppose they have to at least pretend that they're putting some kind of effort into their writing at the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\n5. Always, ALWAYS leave room for a second season\\n\r\n          The harem genre is surprisingly easy to market and sell to viewers, so it's important to keep the money train going until no one shows any interest in your specific series anymore.\\n\\n\r\n6. Main character has some kind of power that no one else has\\n\r\n          To be fair, this is a trait that's common even outside the harem genre, but within harems it adds something entirely different. With an action series, being the only one with a certain power or ability makes you humanity's last hope for survival. In a harem, it makes you an object of desire. Of course all the ladies want to jump your bones; you're the only person here who has this super awesome power. In the case of Trinity Seven, Arata is the \"Demon Lord Candidate\" who has the potential to turn into the Demon Lord, one of the most powerful beings in the world. Another important note is that the power in question is incredibly generic and normally just equates to \"I'm stronger than everyone else because reasons.\"\\n\\n\r\n7. Main character is either overtly perverted or a shy nice guy (who's still incredibly perverted on the inside), but is also incredibly noble\\n\r\n          Again, to be fair to Trinity Seven, Arata certainly falls into the former category, and he becomes so blatant with his perversity that it's almost hard to not like him for it (almost being the important word there). As for the nobility aspects, it plays into why the girls fall for him in the first place. I mean sure he's super perverted but he's just this super nice guy that I can rely on underneath all of that [more heavy-handed sarcasm]. Everything about a harem is designed to make the main male character look awesome, and Trinity Seven certainly doesn't miss its mark.\\n\\n\r\n8. Female characters have no depth other than their assigned archetypes\\n\r\n          When you have this many female love interests on your cast, it's nearly impossible to give them enough characterization to make them feel fleshed-out while still finding time for fan service moments, so the best course of action is to flood your series with as many archetypes as you can: the childhood friend (Hijiri), the plain Jane (Lilith), the loli (Grimoire), the tsundere (Mira), the kooky one (Levi), the childish one (Yui), the tomboy (Akio), ad nauseam.\\n\\n\r\n9. Primary love interest is as bland as a piece of notebook paper\\n\r\n          If the love interest that the main character is eventually going to end up with actually has a personality, the writers run the risk of the viewers not enjoying that specific archetype, so it's always best to choose the one with the least amount of personality possible (and also the biggest cup size). Of course, the two characters in question will never actually reach the point where they could be considered to be in a relationship. I mean lord forbid that you actually do something romantically interesting with your characters.\\n\\n\r\n10. All animation budget goes towards character designs and boob physics\\n\r\n          The fan service is the main selling point of a harem, so it's absolutely vital that this is achieved, often at the cost of the rest of the animation looking terrible. Studio Seven Arcs knows this very well and gave us exactly that. While the action in Trinity Seven wasn't completely awful, the particle and light effects certainly weren't anything worthy of praise, and backgrounds and moving objects were often rendered in the most eye-jarring 3D I've seen in a long time.\\n\\n\r\n11. Fan service out the wazoo\\n\r\n          This one doesn't really need much explanation. You're certainly not watching this because the romance is so unbelievably captivating.\\n\\n\r\n12. Soundtrack occupies the background for the majority of the anime's run time\\n\r\n          I honestly can't even think of a single note from this soundtrack off the top of my head right now, and I just finished the last episode about an hour ago. In this case, the soundtrack was composed by Technoboys Pulcraft Green-Fund (Witch Craft Works), and I wouldn't necessarily blame them for the blandness of the soundtrack because this is a harem after all, and there isn't exactly a long list of standout harem soundtracks.\\n\\n\r\n          Overall, I do think that anime viewers should experience a simple comedic harem at least once, but Trinity Seven certainly isn't the one I would recommend as an introduction to the genre.",

            "content": "With the end of the year 2014 its finally time to also close one of the darkest chapters of my entire life. A chapter which is known as Trinity Seven. Really. I don't even know why I went all the way watching it to the end. Still, its an interesting experience.\r\nEven though its just something along the lines of 'Whew, now I really can point my finger on an anime that is actually... bad.'\r\nBack to serious mode. Obviously I'm still going to be fair with this anime.\r\nFirst of all, storywise. What does this anime have in store for us?\r\nThe mainstory is reasonable simple and catchy.Our MC Arata looses  his cousin Hijiri to a magical phenomenom. So far so well. Thats nothing too bad, it explains what we should have to expect for the next episodes. But why do I dislike the story so much then? Simple. That phenomenom is called 'Breakdown Phenomenom' and is just the first of billions of mechanics which is fired in your face with the speed of a minigun and the power of a railgun. Followed up by Themas and some latin words, sudden english imputs like Limit Breaks, irish legends (Brioriac and Fragrach), etc. The setting of this anime just sucks so hard. Nothing really gets explained in a roundabout way, and even after 12 episodes the only thing I got is that the thema is supposedly the exact opposite to your character. But its not like this is all which sucks storywise. The story is mainly a gauntlet of boobsfondling scenes, slice of life, and obvious plottwists. Just awfully done.\\n\r\nSo overall, I rated the story 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nNext are the artworks. The character designs aren't too bad, even though their colors are a bit pale. Also, I always got annoyed with their faces. They look mostly emotionless, and if you leave away the hairstyles, identical. The backgrounds are no awardwinners either. They are good enough to stand their ground. They aren't too sharp, but are rather colorful. A strange contrast to the grayish-pale characters. Lastly the battlescenes. Swordattacks are the usual black-screen/cut style ones. Uhh... really good, I guess? Nope. The magic isn't that much better, mostly laserbeams and glowing stuff and such.\\n\r\nWhich brings me to 5/10 for the Artworks.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is the best part of Trinity Seven. By far. Lets start with the voice actors. Matsuoka Yoshitsugu aka. Kirito returns. Matsuoka-san isn't new to ecchi by any means, as he also voiced the MC of Mangaka-san to Assist-san to. His performance is as good as ever. The rest of the cast isn't really memorable, but they depicted their characters good enough. The OSTs of Trinity Seven on the other hand were mediocre. As for battle soundtracks we have some mechanical/techno/futuristic kind of music, which reminds me of a worse version of Xenoblade's Mechanical rhythm. The rest of the time the BGM fits the situation without being memorable.\\n\r\nFinally the OP/ED. Seven Doors by ZAQ is a fairly good song, which made it into my 2014 favorites. It got me hyped up for the following 20 minutes and is one of the sole reasons I continued to watch.\\n\r\n7/10 for sounds.\\n\\n\r\nFinally we arrived at Trinity Sevens' achilles heel. The characters.\\n\r\nIf you wonder what exactly is bad about them? Probably everything.\\n\r\nThe Initial character designs are rather flat. None of the characters feel fresh or new. I've seen not completely dense MCs before, and the rest of the Trinity Seven reeks of stereotypes.\\n\r\nI don't even remember whether the girls have backgroundstories or not. As for the interactions between the characters, those aren't any better. Most of the slice of life parts circle around groping boobs, or how lewd Arata is. Whew. Amazing... Finally, the character development. Basically the females all fell for Arata. Thats all the development I got. Thats rather disappointing.\\n\r\nFor the last of the obejective categories I go with 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now the last one. The enjoyment.\\n\r\nWell, you can see on my profile how I rate enjoyment. So lets just say 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10.\\n\r\nA just below average harem anime with more potential than turnout.\\n\r\nThe production values are rather high, but the execution of the plot, the setting, as well the characters are rather bad.\\n\\n\r\nFeedback is appreciated, as usual.",

            "content": "Overall rating should be 8 but...\r\n---\r\nTrinity Seven is a decent Action/Comedy/Ecchi Anime, so if you are not a fan of ecchi, please skip this one. I mean it's very decent anime, but it's not good enough to make you start liking ecchi or something. Anyway, for those who have intention of going for this one, let me encourage you. I won't spoil anything.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nA guy whose cousin disappeared one day decided to learn magic to get her back. Then he went to a magic school, where he met the Trinity Seven AND where his real story began... To be honest, the story is not reallyimpressive. It has some flaws, it's weird, it doesn't really have anything outstanding. You will find awkward and funny moments along with VERY VERY stupid situations and you have to wonder: \"Wtf, why won't they attack instead of talking\". However, in the end, the story is truly enjoyable and I say that you may want to give it a try.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art is good, but not quite impressive. You will find most anime today, 2014, have similar art level and some shows have even better art. Don't expect anything memorable from the art of this show because it's just enough for you to enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nTotally personal experience: I don't find any of the songs catchy so I will give it a 7.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nSeriously, you will have a hard time finding a second female main character like in Trinity Seven: Arata Kasuga. Besides the fact that he is a very caring and nice person, he is perverted, kind of like obvious in an ecchi anime, but he doesn't hesitate to show it out. Also, he is NOT stupid. He knows that the girls have feelings for him and he is willing to accept it.\\n\r\nAlso, Lilith Asami is a very cute girl :D\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI have to say I really enjoy it. It's not an outstanding anime, it may not get your intention, but I like it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nBUT +1 due to the fact that I have a good time watching the show.\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nGive the show a try and make the judgement on your own. The show's worth it.",

            "content": "I'm backwards, so overall first: 8 \r\nComing into the show, you should know first off that this is an ecchi/harem/romance comedy with a sometimes serious aura to push the story along when necessary. If fanservice bothers you, Trinity Seven isn't for you, plain and simple. If that's part of the fun for you, then prepare to be along on a trip to Sexy Japanese Hogwarts.\r\nStory: 7.5 (rounds down to 7, more on that later)\r\nContinuing the Harry Potter analogy: MC Arata gets his life turned upside down when he finds out that there is INDEED magic in his world, and it's about to change his life...or at least introduce him to some beautiful new lady friends. \\n\r\nThe first section feels a bit disjointed, but it's mostly about character building. From about the halfway point on, it's pretty easy to tell where the plot is going, but that's not to say you can't have fun on the way there. The pacing can be a bit inconsistent, but again, from the midpoint on, it stabilized.\\n\r\nNothing groundbreaking here, a fairly simple setup of the oft seen \"I must rescue the one i love\", but with a couple of twists to keep it fresh. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThere are a couple of moments I found really cool where they used real life photography with animation on top of it- had not seen that before. Otherwise, it just looks like your everyday normal anime. Character art is fine, and the action sequences are well animated, but nothing that will blow you away. (I compare things to Sword Art Online, which i find to be incredible well animated) \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe intro and four (count 'em) ending themes are all appropriately energetic and catchy. Not much to say here\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nThis is the meat of the show: the characters. You can't have a harem without breaking a few eggs, right? (woops, wrong idiom) \\n\r\nMC Arata isn't a blockhead moron. He knows what he wants, just not how to do it. He's also not afraid to get his hands dirty.\\n\r\nThe titular Trinity Seven are a group of (all female) skilled mages who are cream of the crop in their particular area of study. They are varied, and fun, and definitely memorable. They aren't all introduced at once, so you get some time to know them before they all show up. I had no trouble remembering or telling them all apart, even though it felt like they introduced someone new every episode. The villains are varied, but I felt like they were rushed a little (in terms of development), but it is a 13 episode show, so not much time to work with.\\n\r\nThey are all motivated in their own ways, and each one has a reason to be there besides checking off boxes in the harem trope *yawn*. Each member plays their part: they do it with style and a healthy dose of sexiness, or tsundere, your pick. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOne of the absolute best parts of the show (for me, the only person whose opinion matters) was the 4th wall destroying humor. I love self aware comedy, and Trinity Seven delivers with a sledgehammer. Arata is also (from what i understand of harems, this is uncommon) an incorrigible pervert, and thrives in the intensely tense estrogen filled environment into which he's thrown (sometimes with the help of a friend). I never found that the show took the scandalous content too far- it never devolves into anything porn-like- strictly pg-13.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts: \\n\r\nFun anime, and after going back and reading the manga, it follows it INCREDIBLY closely, which I thought was excellent. Seven Days took a fun little product, added some extra polish and a bit of movement to the tv screen, and here we are. Looking forward to *hopefully* a second season.",

            "content": "Reconnect to the Invidia Archive.  Executing my Thema: Circumspicio!  What better way to introduce Trinity Seven, a series I've personally dubbed one of the best entries in the harem genre, than an introduction like that?  \r\nStory (7.88/10):  The story of trinity seven is as follows.  A boy by the name of Arata finds himself in his normal life.  Waking up with his normal cousin making him breakfast, his normal walk to school, and even his normal everyday boob grab.  But, soon, he notices something...different.  The world around him has no one else nearby.  There are nopeople, and he notices that the sun is a malicious black.  Then, he gets threatened by a girl with a rifle saying to him about something called a breakdown phenomenon, and the fact that HE himself has caused it with his magic.  And from that point forward, Arata's life of leisure changes as he delves himself into the world of magic and gets to know the seven most powerful mages in the world, the Trinity Seven.\\n\\n\r\nTrinity seven is a very interesting show.  The best way to sum the show up in a few words is \"Harem with a Plot.\"  What makes Trinity Seven so much more different than other harem shows is the fact that the show itself does follow a chronological order of events.  It doesn't use ecchi as the \"audience bringer\" (although, there are enough ecchi moments to fill up two whole episode slots), and it does follow a proper plot, following Arata as he goes through his new life as a mage with the Trinity Seven.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that makes the show very unique is its brand of magic.  Like every other supernatural magic show, Trinity Seven boasts its own explanation for the idea of magic which is honestly one of the best points of the show.  This is due to the fact that the magic for the show is heavily integrated into the show's plot, giving explanation along the way for viewers.  But depending on the viewer, it can get a little difficult to understand due to the heavily thrown out terms that one must learn in order to fully enjoy this show.  (Things like macros, Themas, etc.)  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, Trinity seven hosts its own brand of comedy which is...well, subjective.  (It's harem, what do you expect?)  The entire show is littered with all sorts of innuendos, sexual suggestions, and boob grabbing.  Lots and lots of boob grabbing.  What makes this such a refreshing brand of comedy is just how free the characters are.  Many characters play along with the whole ecchi thing rather than being all embarrassed and shy, which makes the situations not just a standard ecchi moment, but a rather funny one.  In addition, the show's perverted nature rolls with the show and to my knowledge, hasn't made the show any less quality than it is from my viewpoint.  That being said, the show does have many, and I mean MANY scenes like this (you can expect one every five minutes of watching this show.) and can get distracting and put people off due to its sheer amount, as well as sometimes its absurdity.  (Like the all-powerful stripping magic.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, this show was a very faithful adaptation to the manga that this was based on.  The pacing was decent enough so that the viewer wouldn't get left behind on anything that was going on, and the story while still harem-related, followed events that really didn't have to do with a generic harem show, making the show as a whole, surprisingly good.  But while the show itself proves to be good, it does lack in a lot of explanation at the end.  There are many questions that (unless you've read the manga) become left unanswered and really require this show to have a second season in order to continue the story, because this show ends on a cliffhanger that at the end of the day, doesn't please anyone.  (Cause really, the real story of Trinity seven only JUST started with the end of the last episode)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Harem with Plot   (you don't really see many of these.)\\n\r\n+  Good story telling\\n\r\n+  Decent pacing\\n\r\n+/-  Interesting concept of magic  (Can ruin viewing experience if you don't quite get it.)\\n\r\n+/-  Perverted comedy that works in conjunction with the show   (ruins viewing experience if you don't like ecchi\\n\r\n-   Cliffhanger ending\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8.11/10):  Now, onto the real high points of Trinity Seven, the characters.  \\n\\n\r\nKasuga Arata is the main protagonist/harem master of this series.  Now, what would we expect from a harem series from past experiences?  A guy with way too much luck having 3+ girls fall for him while being super nice and not noticing their feelings at all?  No!  Compared to many other harem protagonists, Arata is not a simple plot device, but rather has a personality of his own.  (Take that, Ichika.)  As something of a complete opposite to the normal harem protagonist, Arata has an extremely perverted personality, taking up any offers that the Trinity seven gives, and making any given perverted moment into a hilarious moment via monologue usually ending with \"Thanks for the Feast\"; not to mention, he is aware of the fact that some of the girls actually like him romantically.  As a result, Arata truly becomes a unique character because of how he reacts to different situations he's put in, as well as how much he breaks away from what we anime viewers know of the generic harem protagonist.  He's not afraid to try out something new in terms of magic (or girls) and he really shows motivation for the goal that he's put in front of himself.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have the Trinity Seven.  Since they all account for the title of best girl, I'll try and summarize them the best I can in a few short words with a couple side notes for some of them.\\n\\n\r\nLilith = Large chested tsundere that is a teacher and sort of the \"main girl\".  (stick in the mud)\\n\r\nArin = Kuudere girl that proclaims herself as Arata's wife\\n\r\nLevi = The ninja girl that is just as perverted as Arata is, making many suggestive suggestions.\\n\r\nYui = The big-chested loli Imouto character that has a crush on Arata.   (My personal favorite)\\n\r\nMira = The head of the disciplinary committee that's just a bit too strict. (Also a stick in the mud.)\\n\r\nAkio = The big sister character that often laughs at Arata's constant perverted anctics\\n\r\nLiese = The dark horse of the Trinity Seven with the personality of an alluring mistress.  (According to Arata, has the nicest legs.)\\n\\n\r\nThe trinity seven is the show's core characters, with the entire plot revolving around Arata associating with these seven girls.  What gives the show a plus, as well as a negative is character development.  Some of these girls do have some backstory given to them.  Why they are a member of the trinity seven, what are their motives, and who they are as a person.  As a negative, they don't really do this to many of the girls, leading to some of the girls being a bit fleshed out, while other still stay in their one-note, but still enjoyable personalities.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for side characters, the show has a wide host of different ones that get varying screentime, such as the Astil Codex Grimoire, the perverted headmaster, Arata's cousin Hijiri, and Selina.  These side characters for the most part are quite memorable.  They share similar traits to the main cast of being more unique and memorable than other characters previously seen before.  That being said, you don't really get to know TOO much about them, and they relatively stay in the role of providing conflict, or adding to the perverted moments of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  FANTASTIC Harem MC\\n\r\n+  Great Harem girls\\n\r\n+/-  Character development is uneven amongst characters\\n\r\n+/-  Side characters really only serve one of two purposes\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8.00/10 and 7.44/10):  The art for Trinity seven is done in a way that I feel really fits the show.  The show is drawn in a sort of darker gradient where the characters don't look as bright as other magic shows, but more as a more sinister way of expression, reflecting on the dark ideals and powers that the magic in this show really holds.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, character design is done relatively well, with the characters looking rather nice from scene to scene with little fluctuation between animated quality.  In addition, the magic circles used in this series are fantastically done with a great amount of detail done to them to make them aesthetically pleasing.  \\n\\n\r\nNow, Ecchi.  The Ecchi in this show is overdone, in simple sense.  Very often, you will see boobs.  You will see clothes literally disintegrate off of females, and you will see pantsu, sexy poses, and faces that make the characters look like that they're in heat.  But what makes the ecchi in those show so memorable is the fact that it just looks so natural.  There are no insane dramatic closeups on the characters boobs really any of the ecchi scenes, and because the anime doesn't go out of its way to completely plaster the screen with breasts, the ecchi honestly doesn't feel as distracting as it could've been.  (Ecchi is still VERY prominent, so beware.)\\n\\n\r\nAs for music, the show hosts a very electronic sounding soundtrack, with its opening being a good example of what the music is going to be like.  It's a very interesting genre of music to use for the series, and it certainly is quite memorable.  In addition, the show has three separate endings that all use the similar electronic sound to it, whilst having different feels and emotions for each one.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good animation that fits the show's style\\n\r\n+  Good music\\n\r\n+/-  Cleverly done ecchi  (Can still be distracting if you don't like ecchi)\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (9.89/10):  Yeah, I like this show, maybe too much might I add.  But I digress.  Trinity Seven is a perfect mix for someone like me.  It has plot, it has a great and very memorable main character, and oh so greatly done ecchi.  From the viewpoint someone who basically just watches harem, this is a great show.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nYes.  Very much so.  It combined every aspect of what I find in a good show in addition to the idea of harem.  A good first episode to hook in the viewer, a good and easy to follow plot with chronological events, and explanation for at least most of the plot while leaving a little bit of mystery.  The aesthetics were also very well done, and I congratulate the creators for making a show that looked both brooding and fun at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?\\n\\n\r\nFor one thing, it ended.  I want more trinity seven.  Aside from that, the show really didn't tie up any of the loose ends it made towards the end.  While the anime does follow the manga to the letter, the reality is the fact that, as a downfall, the anime's story is incomplete due to it following only about 30 or so chapters of the manga.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a harem lover like me and sick and tired of harem MC's, or would want to see a show that breaks everything you knew about harem shows, than this show is for you!  Until next time, Magic King Candidate Xadon, OUT!\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.85/10",

            "content": "Writing from a shipper's point of view.\r\nSTORY 9/10\r\nStory is centered around 8 characters. Kasuga, Arata and the trinity seven, mostly Arata's point of view in my opinion. He's out on a quest to get his cousin back after he destroys his home town. And his cousin (?) unknowingly doing so though. Because a circle of fate has chosen him to be a demon lord candidate. \r\nART 10/10 \r\nThe art is is amazing! I love every bit of it, follows the art of the manga exactly. There are only a couple of anime I've seen that copy the art style of the manga. So it getsa full 10.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 10/10\\n\r\nHigh quality sound, amazing songs. Both OPs are very nice and catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 8/10\\n\r\nMy favorite part of the review. At first the characters are all very cliche, but little by little as he gets to know each of them. They change for the better, each and every one of them have there own unique personality that you grow to love in these 12 episode. (Hopefully a season 2 (?) ) But what makes this MC so cool is sometimes he'll favor one of the girls then develop feelings for another. Kinda typical but he's acknowledging them one by one.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 10/10\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say here as all I gotta say is you MUST read the manga first and catch up on that. Before watching the anime, otherwise I'm 100% certain your opinion on it will just be a cool MC with a typical harem. The developments in the manga are something of a masterpiece. And the anime does that very well to incorporate that also.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 9/10\\n\r\nAs for who he gets with it's going to be a harem ending. Sadly... but the relations he develops with each one is an adventure on it's own. If more harems were like this people wouldn't hate harems so much. Great story, nice characters, amazing sounds, lovely art and that's all that needs to be said. Everyone has their own opinion so watch this with open arms.\\n",

            "content": "I came into this series with higher than average hope. The main attraction i had for the series was from small clips that showed the humorous chemistry between the protagonist and his harem. However, that all fell apart as the series progress.\r\nStory:\r\nMagical school setting and protagonist has to \"gain\" the trust of the \"trinity seven\", the strongest girls in the school, in order to attain his goal. Just your generic school setting with magic with 0 relation to school life. the story seem to revolve ONLY its protagonist and its harem, everyone and everywhere else is inconsequential. Fights make NO SENSE. You have a badmage with world ending abilities, she can destroy a area the size of a library all fights in the show happen in a ridiculously small area; within a room, corridor etc. You have MAGIC, you have SWORDS, you have GUNS yet you fight in a 5m radius? GTFO. In addition there are many decisions that doesnt make sense.\\n\r\n1) Why is does the teacher wear the same uniform as your students ? \\n\r\n2) The trinity 7 are the strongest 7 on a magic school, but why does everyone else seem to be just backdrop for the characters to shine? you might as well strip the series of its school setting and have it elsewhere if you're not gonna make use of the school setting.\\n\r\n3) There are other magical campus but all 7 of them are on the same campus? does the other campus have the set of strongest mage? NOPE because you're immediately told one was destroyed while the other was destroyed mid way in the story.\\n\r\n4) His home world got destroyed and all he care about was his childhood friend? what about his family or friends from school? was he born from a tree and knew NO ONE prior to his apocalypse? \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nCharacter designs are cute but dull in color, its like the world had a off palette lens around them. You get your usual loli, tsundere, yandere etc. These characters are introduced in 1-2 min and immediately they hit off like old friends and lovers. The loli literally falls in love with the main character in the first min after seeing each other naked. theres no development are explanation as to why she is so attracted to him, she just does. Only \"reason\" is  that he has the demon lord potential and that her fiance has to be the demon lord potential. 0 character development.\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nNothing noteworthy about the sound production in the anime, generic at best. For a 12 ep anime, the studio seem to prioritize its budget on songs rather than flushing out the story or fight scenes. 4 ED songs, none of which is worth listening. The electro spoken words ED has to be the worse between the 2. The only good thing about the ED is the end of every episode, like you literally can stop watching once you hear \"You you can can choose choose your your de-desti(ti)na(na)tion(tion).\" because that song  brings out the worst of anime electronic music. The only saving grace from the series was Rie Kugimiya's voice acting which is mainly due to a personal bias.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nHumorous but typical harem anime. The anime creates its world with magic yet never address how it works. In fact it flips on itself on the use of \"grimoire\", everyone except the protagonist has a talking grimoire. Is it due to the fact that its some legendary artifact? is the magic from the grimoire or from its user? Final verdict: Not worth your time even if you're bored, i wished i was paid for watching this.",

            "content": "I don't typically get as engrossed in harems as much as other series. I find that although I will enjoy them, I'm not fully absorbed in the world and plot. However, there were a couple things about Trinity Seven that just made it feel different.\r\nFirst, we have the world in which the series takes place. This is usually one of the things that separates an individual harem from another. Trinity Seven had a unique magic system that was quite different even to someone who has read, watched, or played material from thousands of fantasy worlds. The world details started to interest me, which was thefirst thing that pushed Trinity Seven beyond a simple harem.\\n\\n\r\nNext, we have the characters. The MC was fundamentally different from the stereotypical harem MC. He isn't dense in any way I can think of, and therefore would be more easily described as a polar opposite. With the main heroines, you get a nice mix of new and interesting, along with some really well used cliches. More then once, the other heroines poke fun at the tsunderes and clearly emphasize the important personality aspects of each character (\"Oh, so I see you have entered dere mode!\"). Some of the characters even have complex relations with other characters that allow us to see another side of them. A clear example is seen when Mira explains her relationship with Akio.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, alongside these key factors, we are also provided with some small extras. Trinity Seven also included one of my favourite OPs of the Fall 2014 season, and some really humourous scenes and quotes that I will remember long after finishing the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found this series to be very well done. It stands out in the world of harems, which is quite a feat on it's own.",

            "content": "Finally finished all 12 episodes. Now I can review it!\r\nDespite how I enjoyed so very much, I have to give this anime some tough love.\r\nHere we go:\r\nSTORY:\r\nIn the first few episodes of the anime, it jumped around like nobody's business! Not as bad or as far as Baccano, so be at ease, but it was there and can confuse viewers. It leaps from and goes back to different points in time. Not like a flashback, but a rearranging of scenes.\r\nInstead of getting from A to B, you see part of B at first, go back to A to explain B, then jump back to B.Those of you who weren't caught up in the humor of the anime definitely raised an eyebrow.\\n\r\nThe start of the story itself was rushed and generic to a degree, but afterwards you can feel how the episodes pretty much felt like fillers before leading up to a final battle and ending of the series. The humor, characters, and ecchi scenes held me over to a degree, but I had a nagging feeling in the back of my head saying things like, \"When are we going to get on with the rest of the story?\" I hate to say I felt that form an anime I had fun with, but it's the truth.\\n\r\nThe anime can easily be compared to a twinkie with chocolate chips. You're wading through the fluff and filler, in order to reach the meaningful progression (the chocolate chips).\\n\\n\r\nNow for the anime played out. Oh god, how can I explain it so you can understand what's going on.\\n\r\nWe start off with our main character, Kasuga, Arata, waking up from a dream foretelling the viewers that he and a mystery girl will struggle to reach one another but can't. And before the two can grasp each others hands, he wakes up to find himself grasping said mystery girl's breast. \\n\r\nAfter the usual morning skit with the mystery girl, Hijiri Kasuga, and showing off how close the two cousins are, they are off to school. Along the way, theirs another mystery girl who warns him and threatens to kill him.\\n\r\nAside from the death threat, the story seems to be come off as the usual anime in a town. But during the schools break time, our main character notices that the sun is black and misty, and his cousin turned out to be a fake after some seductive and creepy words as she straddled him! At this time, the death threat mystery girl appears, and explains that the world around him was \"created\" by our main character Arata. Once Arata remembers that the real Hijiri vanished right before him, and the fake Hijiri informs him that the real Hijiri is still alive, he immediately is able to get into a Magic Academy because wants to become a mage so he can learn how to get his cousin back.\\n\r\nThat's the jest of it, I left out some details but nothing you can't watch for yourself. It turns and twists, but I'll leave that for you guys to happen upon.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nIt combines a 3D environment, with 2D animation. I found this combination charming, and the inside of the Magic Academy to have interesting designs. But in some cases it was puzzling to look at. For example not in all cases but in some cases where the 2D Characters would walk along the 3D ground, it would make the 3D environment seem out of place. I quickly got used to it though, and it throw me off when action scenes came around.\\n\r\nThe characters design seemed to try and give a unique look to people, but the people looked d a bit off at first. Such as an oval shape glare at the bottom of the eyes of all characters. It made me think that quite a few people were watery or teary eyed, but that was just part of the design.\\n\r\nI know how hard it is to apply something new to anime in regard to design, as viewers may want more of the same, so I commend the series for approaching art in its own way.\\n\r\nThe animation never seemed to miss a beat. It surprisingly kept up with the frames of the opening themes animation. Great detail and attention their.\\n\r\nSurprisingly enough, the characters who were well endowed didn't have breasts, butts, or legs shining through clothing, or eating the clothing. The shining was saved and given in doses along side fanservice. I commend any anime who knows when to hold back on everything being oiled up for the sake of eye candy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\\n\\n\r\nI loved the opening theme, but it took me sometime to get used to the closing themes. It's all good though, great choices in songs.\\n\r\nThe regular music that played throughout the anime was refreshing and imersing. It had tracks that hinted techno, orchestra/piano/stringed instruments, or just a combination of the two. And I'm a sucker for classical music that plays well with animation.\\n\r\nIt had interesting and cool sound effects for spells being cased and used, and great voice acting from memorable voices. I think I recognized Arata's voice actor as the same person who played as Kirito from SAO.\\n\r\nWith pleasant surprises every, and good immersion, this anime isn't lacking in sound.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing I noticed, is how our main character is very lively. He copes well with just about all situations and jokes from the characters around him, his voice actor made him instantly loveable and memorable. Just like the headmaster of the academy.\\n\r\nNot all the girls are fodder that fall in love for the main character after an episode or three, they have their own personalities, opinions, and reactions to the main character! I was floored by this, but not so much to not realize how generic some of them were, ok?\\n\r\nIt's hard to not call them generic when there's the easily embarrassed sex symbol, the monotone girl who claims the main character as her husband, the big breasted Loli who claims the main character as her Onii-san, the TWINS with one who acts like the biggest fan/journalist and one showing off her tits and her intentions in the most sexual way she can, and the girl who's judgmental of the main character until she's forced to get to know him.\\n\r\nThe only unique girls I came across, was the rare rough neck girl who's tall and strong enough to break walls, who makes jokes, and doesn't act seductively AT ALL.\\n\r\nAnd the seductive ninja girl who makes sexy jokes with only a few of the main girls, and the main character.\\n\r\nBut with all this said, these characters make the anime fun and rewatchable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere's hardly anything I didn't enjoy from the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe bold main character who's a refreshing breeze in this anime world led by either either cry babies, accidental perverts who get their butts kicked left and right, or dopey goof-balls.\\n\r\nA harem that feels alive, and not slaves to the plot.\\n\r\nThe fanservice, and action.\\n\r\nIt's like an abridged parody, how hilarious this anime is.\\n\r\nBut how generic, and lacking it is when it comes to story progression, is a painful blister that hurts when touched. Even if it only has 12 episodes to introduce 7 main characters to a MAIN-main character.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\\n\r\nWith tough love, I give Trinity Seven:\\n\r\nA 6 out of 10.\\n\r\nIt's a gosh darn waste! The story doesn't suck, it's just the fluff standing between me and meaningful story progression.\\n\r\n\"I would get you there, but let's go here and work our way to where you want to be.\" \"I'll give you the information you're looking for, but... listen to me sing on stage, then buy me a drink.\"\\n\r\nI don't like having to wait for the story to continue. I had a wonderful time getting to where I needed to be over time instead of just getting their quickly, I love your song and I don't mind buying you a drink, but I can only sit and take so many detours and listen to so many songs so many times before it feels like I'm playing a waiting game.\\n\r\nMaybe the series needed to save up in order to make a 24 episode series. Because it's not like I want things taken out of the anime. Instead, I wanted story progression added into it. Balance out the chocolate chips with the fluff and cream. Make a kick butt twinkie anime. A twinkie anime that's made with everything enriched, and not with something set aside to hail the mindless hordes only in it for the fanservice.\\n\r\nThat said, this anime is a good buy. Granted the makers look up feed back, and improve any other work they put out. I'd love to go to find other people and talk about the anime, or look up fan art. Because the enjoyment is there, the anticipation is there, but not the overall anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd until it is, let's meet up at another review.",

I've never really been interested in harems, but this show had me intrigued. The reason i originally started watching it is because of the art style. It's very unique and i thought it looked pretty awesome. The plot of the story is pretty good, although not great. The show seems to focus on the character interactions more than the actual plot. I like the characters, especially Arata, seeing as he takes charge and isn't afraid to do what he wants. He's pervy and there's a lotof fan service throughout the series. You have some of the typical anime characters like the tsundere and the loli. The fight scenes are good, better than i expected. Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable anime. I've got my fingers crossed they make a season two.",

            "content": "I thank myself for choosing this anime. Trinity Seven looked unfamiliar and not-so interesting for me to watch at first, and also, I hadn't known much about the studio producing the anime, Seven Arcs. But I was impressed by what it has shown for the past 12 weeks.\r\nLooking at the poster, you would known that the anime is going to be a harem in a magic school. While we already encountered many magic (and sometimes having a lot of female characters in the cast) anime, this is definitely going to stand out among the rest this year. The story started in a typical day forArata, living with his childhood friend Hijiri. With the sudden appearance of a magician, later a while, he found out something weird. He learnt that the town they lived was destroyed by a phenomenon and so a grimorie given by Hijiri before disappearing reconstructed it. The magician, Lilith, then invites him to Royal Biblia Academy where he has a goal to save Hijiri. But to do, he has to become a demon lord and gather the Trinity Seven.\\n\\n\r\nSure, big words and seemingly generic story. But the way the anime executes the setting is great. Observing the timeline of this story is like piecing to make a puzzle. As the story progresses, more characters are introduced and usually they take their time in the episode to explain the audience about themselves and perhaps about this magic they possess. Yet again, it has a lot of explanation which you can either get confused of or forget along the way. Eventually, you can get some idea of it unless you are watching it for the fan-service. Each mage has magic based on their thema (theme) and basically they are different types of magic spells to their own desire.\\n\\n\r\nHow the story closes leaves a sweet feeling. I really don't know how the story can continue, since I felt that everything is so clear for me already.\\n\\n\r\nCramming many different types of genres into one story can sometimes be a trainwreck. Trinity Seven tries to balance several of them - action, comedy, ecchi, fantasy, romance and harem. That's a lot. The comedy is funny at times through characters' interaction. There's some action included with battles between the opponents. The fan-service is definitely too much and sometimes repetitive, and it isn't as much as I expected when watching the first episode. The romance and harem aspects aren't fully explored, but there are crushes towards Arata from the characters. Indeed, some relationships develop along the way. In the end, as you can see, it's really hard to maintain, but I don't think this has ruined the anime at all. Of course, this depends on whether you like these genres, or you expected them.\\n\\n\r\nThe Trinity Seven team is an interesting set of characters. It takes time to introduce them one by one and I say that I'm satisfied how the story introduces the characters well with whatever character they have in themselves. I heard that they are based of the \"Seven Deadly Sins\", although I don't recall it being mentioned in the anime. Still, it is a nice linkage.\\n\\n\r\nIt's true to say that you can expect some harem tropes in them. And unfortunately the anime didn't go perfectly in this section. Sure, I said they are an interesting bunch, but that depends on themselves. The girls are interesting because of how they act, but a very few has good development because of the interactions between themselves and Arata. Sometimes, a few of the them looked left out from the rest. But nevertheless, some of the characters also display some different emotions too.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Arata himself, I must give extra points for his attitude. Never-ever dense, this main character knows how to interact, be it in a fan-service or an intense battle situation. From start to end, he knows what he wanted and how to achieve it. Thanks to the girls that helped along the way, he has a lovely development I like to see. Sure, he has his cute side as well - once in a while he feels embarrassed, and as well as having some deep thoughts over things like Hijiri.\\n\\n\r\nThe opponents against the Trinity Seven are cool but doesn't have a wide character and development, possibly due to the time of their introduction. \\n\\n\r\nTrinity Seven's art isn't quite unique. The colour palette used for everything looks dull in some places. While some sceneries look great, the others look plain and boring. It is due to the fact that there's not much lively atmosphere in many of these sceneries. There are CGI used in some interior sceneries for the movement of the camera panning, and I feel it feels nice with the 2D moving animation most of the time. The visual effects are great. Magic circles, sparks flying and explosions feel so well-done. Fighting animation seems fair enough, but yet again there's not really much fight scenes that involve punching. Some battles have this nice impact that leaves a nice finish.\\n\r\nThe character designs are weirdly good. Their body shapes are fine but I feel that the character designs in the manga looked better, maybe because of more realistic details. Some faces might look weird but you will get used to it soon. The facial expressions vary and even from a multi-genre anime, I like how they show the feelings of the characters, either comedic or not.\\n\\n\r\nZAQ decides to sing another single. If you know her by now, most of the songs have a different feel and style. Seven Doors has an epic rock feel that gets into the groove of Trinity Seven, along with her great voice that matches along the instrumental. It's definitely one that can stand out from the rest of openings in this season. Meanwhile, the anime has four songs of different styles as well. Each are sung by a pair of voice actresses that their characters are well-related. Overall, I enjoyed all but one but I love to see a nice variety of this.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music has a nice take over the battle scenes, generating some hype and action that blends well. Other scenes are fine as well. Besides, its main genre focus is techno (electronic) music. The voice acting is done well, it helps to match whatever the character is acting or saying. I love to see some voice actresses acting out of their usual acting. One example is Yumi that voices Takane from iDOLM@STER, voices Lilith. And we all know who voiced Arata. Yoshitsugu is very famous and voiced many different characters, but it's good that he keeps it to Arata's character for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI really can't say if this is a recommendation for everyone, but I personally enjoyed whatever Trinity Seven has offered. There may have been a lot of explanation to go through or maybe you can't stand a lot of fan-service, but I guess I'm happy to see that this generic setting is executed well.\\n\\n\r\nI don't mind continuing the manga after the anime, and I don't know if we're getting a second season or not. There's still an OVA, so it's worth catching it for a fix of never-dense main character with his interestingly weird harem.",

            "content": "TLDR: Generic magic fantasy story with a harem and fan service\r\nTrinity seven's story was quite confusing and boring. It started off for a few episodes where I didn't know what was happening because I didn't care. T7's premise was generic fantasy where our MC finds power and has to save the world. Where it is different is he has a harem and you can't really tell what he's trying to save, except for his cousin. The magic system was original, but uninteresting, and the names for everything are the generic fantasy names that you see in many pieces. You have your Norse, Biblical, and othermythological names that you see everywhere. Which is fine, usually; however, after so many pieces of entertainment have used it, original concepts go a long way. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation quality is a bit above average for today's standard. It excels during fights and is decent the rest of the time. There is a lot of fanservice. MC is a \"lucky pervert\" and see's, touches, and fantasizes about all of the girls' boobs. You can't go an episode without characters awkwardly falling on top of each other; either exposing their crotch or boobs. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound quality is above average. The OP was really catchy and the ED's were ok. The BGM was very fitting for each scene and I noticed it a lot of the time. I found it exceptional. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were your run of the mill Tsundere, Kuudere, Dandere, etc. Liese best girl, don't you deny that. Each and every girl was nice to look at ;) and had somethings that were interesting about them. My only complaint was the shit MC who looks so very stupid. Every time I look at Arata, he seems a bit off, somehow. Also, he is  quite the average pervert and isn't really interesting. He has his moments, but wasn't a good MC. Characters are a bit too generic, overall, so 4/10 seems appropriate. \\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment for this skyrocketed about halfway through the series. This turned from a 3/10, overall to a 7/10 over the course of the second half. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, T7 isn't spectacular. It was fun to watch, but hard to get into. I wasn't expecting much going in; nevertheless, after watching the show, I was still thoroughly entertained. 54/100",

While at the start, i felt this just got in the way, it did (unfortunately) turn out to be slightly relevant during some later episodes.\r\nStill i WOULDN'T say that \"it's all about Harem\", as there really is aserious story to be told. I loved the plot twists, the suspense, and the realizations. Though, it's all presented in an \"immediate scope\" - meaning that there's no time for any additional character development, or details that could make it easier to become better acquainted with the Trinity Seven. \\n\r\nIt seems that at times, particularly near the start - they tried to rectify this, with a slower pace: which did help induce a definite sense of wonder and mystery when i begun watching.\\n\\n\r\nThough, with the added pressure of only 12 episodes to tell a story worthy of a much larger anime title, like a kid drawing \"bubble letters\", it seemed that after the half way mark, they were running out of space, and so a significant amount of content had to be lost in order to convey the bare bones of the story.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're planning to watch as a thriller, then this really does do action, suspense, AND PLOT TWISTS!\\n\r\n - rather well.

And he tries to get on the good side of the 7 strongest mages; the Trinity Seven, who are all girls in order to get back his cousin who disappeared due to some magic (breakdown phenomenon).\r\nArt 7/10:\r\nWhat's wrong with thoseeyes?

Yeah, so it's got good animation and character design.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10:\\n\r\nThe protagonist is an ultra pervert whose most powerful magic is ripping apart everyone's clothes. Other than that, the trinity seven are quite good. They don't go into the depth of each character, just their powers and there affection for the perverted demon lord aka the protagonist.The bad guys, well, they just pop out of nowhere and the last 2 episodes deal with the real antagonist's of the series. And what's their story, sorry, but that's not told.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10:\\n\r\nThis series starts out quite good but soon I was just watching it to complete it. Power ups come in an instant. One time he doesn't know a thing, the next episode, he's kicking major butt and has become a demon lord. \\n\\n\r\nThe series has a complete ending but many things are still left untold and the main purpose of the protagonist is still to be achieved.

            "content": "I'm just going to review this purely on my own enjoyment, and how I thought it all came together.\r\nStory: This is one of those stories where you get thrown right in, and you're not certain what's going on. It's also one of those stories where the Main character is one of the only males, and he is the top dog. He's randomly the top dog, when he joins a school of mages. That's right a school. So here we have, an easy setting to navigate, and the 'trinity seven,' three antagonists that don't show up till the last two episodes, and a sister of thetrinity seven. So that's 11 girls for this Main Character to chose from in his big harem. Basically, it's as cookie cutter as it gets. The Main MC, is an all powerful mage, right off the bat. The fan service is also off the charts, happening at one scene every three to four minutes. Not to say, fan service is bad, and shouldn't be put in a story, It just felt like it was over done. It was enjoyable, because of the magic factor. A decent portion of the magic was explained, and the way the world worked was explained, therefore I think that put it above and beyond a lack luster harem show.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The character designs were pretty cute, and Arata was decently handsome, same with the headmaster. When the shit hit the fan, the magical fights were fantastic. My biggest and most glaring problem with the show was that they DIDN'T go anywhere besides the school, and maybe a beach. So all we saw was a crappy 'cg' model of a school and it's rooms, and outside campus, and maybe a pretty background of a ruined world at sun set. \\n\\n\r\nSound- I loved the opening song. I watched it 9 times! It had a very wild song, that reminded me of 'another's' op. If you've seen it! I can get behind the soundtrack as very soothing on the ears, and playing the right moods at the right times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Literally no development for any of the characters. I thought the tidbits for the characters were lacking. The only real details we got were how the characters got along together and what trope they fell into in a harem world.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I liked it! It's probably not for the most critical players in the anime game, but you know its a decent watch being that it's 12 episodes. I can get behind it as being a 'hit or miss' but you can see for yourself. If you dislike overly undeveloped harems (and I don't mean their bust sizes), don't watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Seven. It's good, but it isn't THAT good. I can give it a seven due to it's soundtrack, decent magical background, and great fights. We all factor in different 'feelings' when writing reviews and giving anime a score. Up to you how you think it'll do.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "First of let me say that this is probably the first time that i watched a harem where the guy wasn't an absolute wimp. Most of the harems I have seen the guy has absolutely no friggin clue that the girls want him, however in this anime we get a guy who isn't afraid to say \"thank you for the tit show\".  Honestly I couldn't find anything that I didn't like about this anime.  If you are going to watch this anime I would recommend wearing headphones because the music is much better when you can actually hear the bass.  The musicis what turns this anime from a mediocre harem anime into a brilliantly done (in my opinion) masterpiece.  From the start I found the easy going perv Kasuna Arata to be very likable.   One of the biggest issues I get with harem action animes is that they never really have time to develop the relationships between the MC and his harem, no such problem with this anime.  Honestly, I am absolute crap at explaining these things.  This anime was so damn good I couldn't resist giving a review.  I honestly think that if you give it a shot you just might like it.",

            "content": "Like many other ecchi harem romcoms. The mundane protagonist is gifted with abilities far superior to any other person. Never judge a book by its cover as Arata Kasuga is spoilt and loved. \r\nThe Trinity Seven are seven mages who each stand at the peak of their fields. Each world has it's own Trinity Seven. \r\n*Spoiler Festival* Read At Own Caution\r\nStory-\r\nThe introduction of this anime is pretty much the most overused scene of any romantic comedy as the MC clutches onto his 'cousins' oppai.\r\nFollowing this they head out and an ominous explosive purple sun shines through the sky acting as an assault to the eyes.Later he and Hijiri (cousin) walk past a red -haired girl who somehow telepathically threatens Arata by saying 'Awaken now,Arata Kasuga. If you do not, I will have to kill you.' then disappears as if she never existed. At this point, I think many viewers were thumping their legs in excitement waiting for something to happen. Soon enough, it is revealed the world that once existed had been pretty much wiped out by a breakdown phenomenon. Arata wished for the world to become as it used to be and his fake cousin granted it.\\n\\n\r\nHe along with the Hijiri imposter are encountered by the red-haired girl, Asami Lilith. He is given a choice \\n\r\n1. To have the grimoire (magical item) dispel the fabricated world now, and promised the ability to live out his days peacefully. However, the grimoire will be disposed, and all memories of Hijiri Kasuga and the others will be erased.\\n\r\n2. If he won't hand over the grimoire, he will be killed.\\n\\n\r\nIn this life or death situation he manages to mockingly think of another option, to become a mage. The entirety of the anime has no extremely important events, however are events (filled with clean fanservice) which show how the Arata Kasuga 'gets close' to the Trinity Seven of Royal Biblia Academy. If fighting scenes were lengthened I personally would have enjoyed this more however they decided to remain faithful to the romcom genre by focusing more on characters than action. This move made the ending very very disappointing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt-\\n\r\nAll in all, the art in this anime are of a decent standard. The only thing which bugs me is Arata's nose. I can't tell if it's just me but it always stands out ahahah.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\r\nAll voice actors have voices which are definitely appropriate for the characteristics and attitudes of their corresponding actors. The Opening Song Seven Doors by Zaq is quite catchy however the wors actually sang in the beginning seem very unclear and does not really attract the audience enough. There are 4 different Ending Songs with none giving myself a strong impression of a good anime song. Overall the 'sounds' of the anime were just above average with nothing overwhelmingly excellent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\r\nCharacters. Good character development definitely does not make everybody enjoy it however poor character development ensures minimised enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nTrinity Seven has a diverse range of character traits with the standard underdog protagonist who is given a rare characteristic of confidence for his role. Many many many perverted underdog protagonists are usually shy at first however the Arata always has a confident stance upon his straightness and love for women. \\n\\n\r\nTrinity Seven has all pretty and beautiful girls who all have completely different personalities towards Arata. Arin Kannuzuki innocently and emotionlessly calling Arata his husband, Yui Kurata calling him her brother who can do anything to her, Asami Lilith (sorta) and Mira Yamana the Tsunderes and then the unforgettably seductive Lieselotte Sherlock who seduces Arata in public and then standard 'normal' characters.\\n\\n\r\nNote: The principal is very very laidback and is perverted to some extent\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\r\nAs one of the many romcoms I have watched. This would probably be just above the centre. I think the main reason I enjoyed this was due to the well developed characters along with the abundance of laughs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\r\nOverall I would highly recommend Trinity Seven to those that enjoy the genres included. It may not be a stunning anime however it is quite solid and seem to get what is seeked. If you are not a fan of this sort of Romantic Comedy Magic Ecchi then I would not specifically prioritise this over the viewers own personal preferences.\\n",

            "content": "There are many improvements that could've been implemented during the creation of this show but that's not to say that Trinity Seven was in any way unsatisfying, particularly in the fan service department.  Trinity Seven does offer much more than this though like it superbly done 3DCG integration and memorable characters that break the boundary of most typical harem ecchis and this isn't even mentioning the variety of the characters that are provided. Anyways here's my review, continue to read and see if this show is for you. \r\nArt and animation gets a solid nine out of my book.  The one thing thatsome of these action-harem animes do very good is focus on the aesthetics of a show; granted there is some very aesthetically displeasing shows of this genre as well.  Trinity Seven I assure you, is not one of them.  It does its action sequences very well as a result of the detailed animation and provides almost flawless integration of its 3D elements even during casual scenes that include no action whatsoever.  This also does well to improve some of the ecchi and fan service elements should that be something you're interested in. If not, then Trinity Seven will not be disappointing to the average viewer that pays no heed to such elements. \\n\\n\r\n As for the soundtrack that Trinity Seven provides it has its pros and cons.  I would be quick to rate some of the action sequences sound effects to be really high, but it's not impressive to hear good quality explosions from a medium that is widely used to convey action.  Another con of sound effects lies in the lack of atmosphere.  Sometimes background noise can be somewhat annoying if not really annoying, but lack of it completely seems dull to the viewer and was something Trinity Seven failed to provide. Trinity Seven did provide some pretty memorable audio from its music soundtrack however.  The OP was most impressive and complemented the visuals marvelously.  Soundtrack within the anime itself should it be noticed was vastly unique and worked well with the occasion presented withing the show.  With these things being said, the sound wins itself seven trinities out of ten. \\n\\n\r\nEven though Trinity Seven did have a knack for favoring some characters over others, it did extremely well on the characters it focused on. There wasn't any characters I would call rogue personally for most characters had some if not good history explained, and those vital to the story that was presented had reasons for what they were doing. In many of the most recent ecchi based shows I've seen growing complaints about predictable and plain characters from those who are not avid viewers of the genre.  If you are one of these people; a refreshing look on the ecchi/harem genre may be taken from viewing this show. Especially since the protagonist is not average in any sense, but can also hold his own when he wants to. There is a theme here for him and he does grow stronger.  As a result characters get a commendable eight out of ten.\\n\\n\r\nFinally is the story, which I would regrettably say is very mediocre because of one major flaw.  Trinity Seven is a magic show revolving around mages and it seems like the magic never really gets explained properly.  Of course a valid counter-argument would just be, \"It's magic, leave it at that!\" but it doesn't really hold to much ground seeing as they tried to explain some aspects of it. Plus is the finer details that create some pretty extensive plot wholes that are probably better covered in the accompanied manga.  These finer details are of course more whys and hows, curiosities that trouble the observant and knowledge-seeking individuals.  Other than that is the fair but inconclusive ending.  A five out of ten for an entertaining but somewhat lacking story. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Trinity Seven is a good anime, and I would recommend to people that are slightly interested or actually dedicated time to read this review to watch it. I personally enjoyed it and would only stagger on a re-watch for those first six episodes, the later half was more impressive for me.  Please leave feedback, and I will continue to write reviews sporadically.",

            "content": "I was looking for a fun, lighthearted anime and Trinity Seven gave me just that. In short, Trinity Seven is magic, comedy, and lots of fanservice. I haven't read the manga so I can't really compare the two but overall I enjoyed watching the series. \r\nThe story basically follows Arata, whose cousin and childhood friend Hijiri disappears during a big magical disaster, which motivates him to enroll in a magic school to become a mage in order to find Hijiri and bring her back (conveniently, Arata appears to be the only dude in the academy). The Trinity Seven are the seven most powerful mages atthe school. Arata befriends the Trinity Seven and harem-esque scenarios ensue.\\n\\n\r\nProbably the biggest reason Trinity Seven stands above the rest of the genre is that the MC isn't an incompetent idiot. Arata is driven, strong, and most importantly, not irritating. He's a very likable lead and his pervyness provides laughs throughout the series. 12 episodes doesn't give a lot of time for character development but you know right from the start that Arata isn't lame.\\n\\n\r\nThe Trinity Seven are, as expected, a group of very powerful and very beautiful young ladies. They basically all fall into one trope or another, but were you really expecting anything else? The important thing is that they're all likable. In fact, I don't think there's an irritating character in this series. The show puts focus on Lilith, Liese, and Mira, which unfortunately leaves the rest of the Trinity Seven feeling rather one-dimensional. 12 episodes is just not enough to develop every one of them. This series could easily have been twice as long.\\n\\n\r\nBut despite its short length, the pacing is, for the most part, on point. My biggest complaint is that the show stumbles in the last few episodes and the story gets muddled. Too many new characters are interjected and I felt a little confused after the last episode, but the ending sets up nicely for a second season, which I certainly hope will be produced.\\n\\n\r\nTrinity Seven does a lot of things right. This is excellent execution of a very familiar formula. Big props to the art team for the excellent animation job and the sharp, attractive character designs. Most harem anime tend to get boring fast, but Trinity Seven held my attention. It's a nice, short, fun series to watch when you have some time on your hands.",

            "content": "I don't know if it's just me, but I always like those types of anime where the main character is the 'chosen one'. Is that the main reason why I really like Trinity Seven? Nope.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nA great story this anime has. Each episode doesn't drag on and introduces a new problem every 2 episodes. I was really into the anime and to see what happens after each episode, even though some of the action scenes are anticlimactic. The action is best when it's around Arata, mainly because he's a badass. Comedy-wise? I'd say it was mediocre, because it uses falling down and grabbing boobs almosteach episodes and that annoys me A LOT. Though, sometimes Arata can be funny because of how straight-forward he is when he's being a pervert. A lot of fan-service in the anime, though the story itself overpowered the fan-service. Mainly when the protagonist is OP/the 'chosen' one, he would have a harem around him and of course, that theory goes with this anime. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was nice and smooth, the colors were very nice in fact. The animation of the magic circles is nice and smooth and there was this one episode were Lillith was walking down a hallway and the animation was really smooth. Overall, the art is very nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is alright, though sometimes the OST would be playing louder than the voice actors. The OP fit the anime nicely, with the drums,the electric-guitar and the fast-paced singing to fit with the action theme of the anime. The anime actually had 4 EDs. The first one, being my favorite as it sounded like a romance song. The second one fits more for a slice of life anime. The third one somewhat fit the anime mainly because it sounds like it's a song for a comedy anime. The fourth one sounded like it was for a really boring, 2000ish anime. Though, I usually skip the OP/ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI'd probably say that the characters are what raised the overall points to an 8.\\n\\n\r\nArata Kasuga, the protagonist of the story. The main reason I like him is he's a pervert, but not that type who's really annoying and can't control himself. He's more of the cool pervert, that can control himself and is always smooth, even when he's making pervert jokes. He's really kind to others that even try to kill him.\\n\\n\r\nAsami Lillith, probably the biggest tsundere in this anime. She's a teacher at the same age of the students (o.O) and likes to hit Arata whenever he's doing something perverted. She has a nice body figure and she always blushes whenever someone is talking about sexual stuff.\\n\\n\r\nKannazuki Arin, a very monotone girl. She doesn't scream whenever someone is peeking at her such as Arata. The sentence she says the most is 'That's difficult for me' or a long those lines. She always continues Arata's sexual jokes, like saying \"So you wanna have sex before marriage?\". \\n\\n\r\nYamana Mira, also a tsundere, but rarely showed her feelings to Arata until the end. She always blushes whenever she sees something that looks sexual, but it isn't. She's bestfriends with:\\n\\n\r\nFudou Aiko, a very roughly dressed girl who never buttons the last button, so that means her belly button will be shown all the time. She's very strong physically and only uses her hands and feet to fight.\\n\\n\r\nKazama Levi, a very high-classed ninja. She doesn't show that much interest in Arata and doesn't have that much emotion. \\n\\n\r\nKurata Yui, a very cheerful character and she's really cute. She shows a lot of interest in Arata, to the point where she kisses him on the cheek occasionally in public. She's a very childish character, but in a cute way.\\n\\n\r\nSherlock Lieselotte, a main character who was revealed very late into the anime. She is an evil mage but after the fight, she started to show interest in Arata. She's a very cheerful character and doesn't look that evil.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime a lot. I had first impressions of this anime when I saw the cover photo. I thought it was going to be a mystery, psychological anime but after watching it, I was wrong. I watched this whole anime in one sitting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nA very nice harem+romance+action anime. If you're looking for an anime to kill time, then this anime will do. Would I re-watch it? Yes, definitely.",

Arata's jokes and overall attitude towards being a pervertare refreshing rather than apologetic like in other anime.\\n\\n\r\nI like the art, sound and animation but have seen better.

It was a great show, focusing on a perverts dream? Yeah, i will have to go with that. A perverts dream for sure.\r\nI think this show should go on for sure, but what i miss the mostwas the lack of romance / relationship in these typical series, this was a different experience you could say, even tho i remember this kind of experience with the DxD series.\\n\\n\r\nWould love to see a season 2 and if possible, buy merch/DVD's with this series. This isnt something i would do normally, but it would be cool having this in a physical form to, not talking waifu-pillows for you reading :)\\n\\n\r\n-Multix aka John",

The story stayed with the route that the manga had which was a major plus for me. The only thing that kind of bothered me was it would've have been a much better ending if itended on the next conflict that would've happened after the end but that's neither here nor there. For what was giving it was enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6\\n\r\nThe art was kind of disappointing to me. It seemed like the creators loved to gray tone everything. The setting just seemed really dull and lacked bright colors. Each character did look how they were supposed to, I just didn't like how depressing the setting looked.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7\\n\r\nI put 7 on sound most the time unless the intro or outro is download worthy. I really never judge sound because I really haven't experienced a bad sound in anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9\\n\r\nEvery character was unique. They had their own personalities as in the manga and no one was really similar. Plus you rarely see a an MC with perverted confidence in anime as you do with this one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7\\n\r\nLike said before I was eager for this to become an anime and seeing how they stayed on the same route with the manga is a win. It was enjoyable and I don't regret watching it. I would recommend this to someone who enjoys the ecchi genre but for those who hate fanservice stay away from this.",

            "content": "Trinity Seven is a unique harem anime in that it features a strong male lead that isn't afraid of groping ass and tits and a female cast that actually doesn't have a problem with him doing so. Now you're probably thinking - impossibru Simonian, how can such flawlessness be?  I assure you it can and it's right here. \r\nThe story is rather bland. A generic school setting wrapped up in some magical theme. It's the weakest component of this anime. Slow progression and ultimately goes nowhere... but if you like ass and tits and moreover if you like them poked, stroked and groped -story isn't really going to be a problem. \\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to the wonderful characters of this show. Now whoever came up with the concept of this show's MC (Kasuga Arata) deserves a cookie with viagra fillings. Arata's charm to the females in this show is like a ripe banana to fruit flies. This guy doesn't stutter, he possesses confidence like no other and a pair of solid balls. This guy makes no limp dick excuses either. He grabs the sexual goods either intentionally or by accident and calmly thanks the females for the opportunity afterwards. A rare sight in harem shows.\\n\\n\r\nBut herein lies the problem. That's pretty much as far as the harem and \"romance\" component of this show goes. It's mostly jokes and some light frottage. The romance component never really seems to break through the comedy, limiting the vast potential Trinity Seven had. For example : Arata touches a tit, girls don't have a problem and want to take it further - suddenly both sides calmly play it off as a joke and go their merry ways. The fuck? If a girl has no problems with a guy touching her tit in real life, the end result is either a spent condom or a pregnancy. \\n\\n\r\nBut I'm going off on a tangent here. What I'm saying is the comedy limits this show a LOT. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the visual and sound departments they're honestly good. The scenery and characters look crisp in 1080p, opening and ending songs are decent and voice acting fitting and authentic. Sound effects accompanying various magical spells and battles alike are spot on and what one would expect.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment? Thoroughly entertaining due to the characters. Story-wise it's fairly weak. Arata and the girls make a near perfect combination. Ecchi in a harem setting is good thanks to MC's unstoppable sack while the romance is limited by the comedy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, still a good series. Strongly recommended. \\n",

The fan-service better be expected, and if you find that annoying you may want to check out a different genre. \r\nCharacters: 9\r\nI am opening up with what I believe to be the best aspect of this show, it's characters. More often then not in ecchi anime your characters fit a checklist of generic cardboard cutouts. But to my great liking, Trinity Seven did not follow that mold. \r\nOur MC is not a predictable pervert, he is not one to stumble into a half-naked girl, get anose-bleed, stammer apologies, then get slapped. Now granted, he is still a pervert, but he is confident about it.  He was my personal greatest enjoyment in watching this show as he made an average ecchi situation into something glorious. He is also not a complete idiot, which was also refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nThe remainder of our cast is unsurprisingly female. Now I personally found them all to be decent little characters. Now they still fit the bill of being cardboard cut-outs, but I would say are by no means generic. As if the creators went to a different store to buy them, one that is in an alley with a small sign and only a single employee. \\n\r\nI did not find the character development to be very well done. It felt rushed, and it is fairly obvious they just tried to find places to shove it into 12 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nThis is in my opinion the weakest aspect of the show. It was convoluted and jumbled, with a predictable outcome. It piqued my interest in the first episode, but I never felt that my interest went beyond a slight curiosity. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI am no expert, but the animation felt very well done. The action scenes were the only aspect where I felt a difference in quality, but this show is not nearly action-intensive enough for me to ever feel bothered by it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe OST did it's job, I cannot really say more than that. The tracks never jumped out at me as being amazing, but they did their job to compliment what was on screen. \\n\\n\r\nI will make a special note for the opening, as I found it to be a very good. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nDespite my comments on the story, I was never once bored when watching this; to the contrary effect, I was always ridiculously entertained. I attribute a very large part of that to the characters and their interactions with one another. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I would say it was good. It had some standout aspects to it, enough that I am tempted to say it was \"very good\" and give it an 8, but the story at this juncture prevents me from doing that. It was an extremely enjoyable 4 hours that I spent watching this show.",

We first had Highschool DXD, but the main the catalyst was Mahouka (and now anime fans confuse between what\u2019s Harry Potter and Tetsuya) \u2013 so I thought highschool anime was enough... \u201cMagical\u201d highschool alternatively, says on the tin: 5 Star Apex Material, totally revolutionary and made zillion-zillion copies \u2013 creating an occult religion thinking that the events of this trend was real. However, Trinity Seven surpasses its predecessorsfor one unforgettable aspect that indeed, many writers must learn: Your making a teenage porn novel for f*ck sake! Drama, is necessity \u2013 or you have broken a universally acknowledged fact.\\n\\n\r\nIt is apparent, that Trinity characters were written by Japanese Koreans. Therefore, the complex caricature perfectly capsulise the two dimensional tsundere read head, the quiet kuudere type, three dimensional slutty babe (that rarely appears) and a staggering magnitude of artistic clich\u00e9 characters. There is a lack of pretentious themes via presentation, which solidifies the placement amongst the writing. It spares dramatic moments over self-indulgence, and this other-worldly atmosphere as otaku viewers dream of having that three dimensional slutty babe at their bed (don't forget the shower scene), or accumulating so much power to create entire universes. Therefore, nothing becomes inherently or morally wrong, since such rare anime become so honest about themselves disregarding its own quality is no longer idiotic writing. It is being logical.\\n\\n\r\nWithout a discharge of braincells, this anime is inferior amongst its own brethren.

            "content": "Trinity Seven is an anime that, at first glance, seems pretty interesting... until you get to, I wanna say, episode three or so, and then you realize this is just another harem anime that tries too hard. While this anime does have some things going in its favor, most of the good is smothered by the bad.\r\nSo, why don't we start with the good first, hmm? I suppose I could start by saying that the original premise of the story is quite intriguing. You've basically got a young man living in a small town that was destroyed by what's called a Breakdown Phenomenon, until theappearance of a magus leads him to attending the Royal Biblia Academy... yeah, I know, the name kind of sucks. Just roll with it. You also soon learn that Arata, the main character, is a Demon Lord Candidate, which I guess is this anime's name version of a badass.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story itself seems intriguing enough, there are a lot of cliche's here, first and foremost being the magical high school cliche. I sometimes feel like the only reason Arata was even sent to this high school was so he could find his harem and take over the world. While I don't dislike the harem genre, I do when the harem smothers the story into oblivion like this one does.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the stereotypical \"magical high school with useless teachers who don't actually do anything\" setting, the story itself has a lot of pointless fanservice. Not the good kind of fanservice that makes you laugh, but the kind where you're staring at the screen and wondering why the hell some girl keeps getting randomly stripped naked. The fanservice in this anime isn't funny, and it doesn't add anything to the story. At the same time, it holds itself back, as if the animators tried really hard to make this a serious story with a deeper plot. Unfortunately, they failed epically at this. Trinity Seven not only has the feel of a stereotypical anime with no plot beyond \"give Arata a harem,\" it doesn't go anywhere with the harem itself. They're just sort of there.\\n\\n\r\nThe battles are also really boring, the principle is supposed to be this badass but acts like a pervy old man, and all of the characters feel like cardboard cutouts of archetypes. Because of all the negative qualities this anime has, I can't really recommend it.",

            "content": "Trinity -6-\r\nI'll be really honest here since this is one of my favorite series right now, but I won't let my enjoyment cloud my judgement.\r\nCritical Review:\r\nStory: 4\r\nStory was bland, generic, and overall just confusing. How does a series cover up confusing and unknown terminologies, plot and other story elements? By making entirely random stuff up with random descriptions and reasons for it. This clich\u00e9 isn't new, and almost a lot of animes do this, and this one is no exception. But probably the bad thing about this is that, they don't do well enough to properly explain them, unlike other series with much more complicatedterminologies like To Aru Majutsu No Index, not a comparison of their plot, but rather how series like the To Aru does well with their detailed explanations and can get away with convoluted ideas like it.\\n\\n\r\nPlot development was horrible, everything was happening in a weird pace. The story arcs were all over the place, and there was contingencies everywhere, which was bad.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nArt was fairly decent for the most part. Not bad, not entirely good either. There were times I actually liked some scenes, esp the fight scenes, but some scenes were just too bland. The character designs was pretty good though, which bumped my rating.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nI don't really know to be honest. I didn't hear anything out of place, nor was there anything that caught my attention. Music is not noticeable for me either. So I'm sorry if this is somewhat biased for me, but I'll need to give this score.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nCharacters were pretty good. Most of them, while generic, are somewhat still memorable. However most of this score should be because of the MC. He's not your usual Harem character, who's weak, shy, \"innocent\", and such. He's one of the few ones out there that actually controls his harem, compared to countless others out there, where the MC is usually the one being exploited. MC is basically a near-Gary Stu, and while the pacing of his character development is dull, his personality somewhat makes up for it. \\n\\n\r\nThe female cast are made up of a bunch of cliches from the big-breasted girls to the lolis, with the personality tropes ranging from different kinds of Deres, including, but not limited to your usual Tsunderes, Kuuderes and Derederes. I don't know who stands out the most, but personally my favorite out of them all would be the ninja. Overall, it's just your usual trope of characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nWhile the story was sub-par, I enjoyed it. This is mainly due to the MC's interaction with his harem. I liked how he plays his harem quite well, even though he an unsatisfying development transitions, he gets away with it. The fight scenes were quite decent, and I enjoyed a few of them. Fan-service was present almost entirely throughout, but to be honest it wasn't that much eye-catching for my taste. It was good, if not for the story, it could've been better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.8 rounding to 6.\\n\r\nI'm sorry if this is low. While I did enjoyed it quite a lot, the story was just too bland for me. They got me with their MC, and to be honest, if it wasn't for the MC, it wouldn't even be this high. If it was only paired with a better storytelling and plot development, I could've scored this a lot higher. \\n\\n\r\nDon't take my word for it though, I still kind of recommend it for people who likes stuff like this and doesn't mind its flaws. I'm still reading the manga after the anime ended, a testament that I really enjoyed it.\\n\r\n--\\n\r\nReviewed on July 18, 2016. Recapped everything through memory. This is my honest review, but there might be some errors due to time gap between my review and the last time I watched it. Don't take my review as the only reference for taking an interest in this series.",

            "content": "*MINOR SPOILERS*\r\nI came into this anime with zero expectations and got an average story with some well thought out characters, and some minor confusion..\r\nThe story leads a guy called Arata who was presumably living a pretty normal life with his \"sister\" Hijiri, when out of nowhere a \"Breakdown Phenomena\" took place, taking Hijiri away from Arata, into another dimension, and leaving Arata to presumably make a whole new world for himself. He then gets transported, by lilith, who came to save him from his own demise, to a school of magic, where you have underclass mages, and higher class mages. The story goes on asArata gains his Harem and ultimately saves the world, again, as we find out later that this whole story is pretty much the Matrix....Overall the story itself is pretty much a lake that's one mile long, but one foot deep, it has enough to satisfy you, but that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nArt is pretty basic, as you have your standard anime style of art, and the graphics/effects are also quite basic. Not much to say other than good job for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nIf you follow me and read my other reviews, i watch, mainly, dubbed anime, so for this one, the dub is actually quite good, and the OP.....oh god, this OP is probably one of the most addictive OP's I've ever heard, i can't ever get the rhythm out of my head for the life of me, but it's still a good OP nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are definitely this anime's strong point. Every character has their own vibe, and i love it when you have such a variety of characters and personalities. They're all thought out well and i would watch this show because of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSo this show was good for the most part. But it definitely lacks in the story department. I could possibly see a S2 for this one, but don't expect it to be any better than this. Overall, this show was mildly confusing, as i didn't get how Arata was so chill about the fact that the world randomly ended and how the sun was freaking black, oh and how he just randomly gets magic abilities. But aside from all of this shows gripes, it's still a pretty decent one.",

            "content": "Trinity Seven is Ecchi, it's Harem, it's magic, it's school setting, but let me tell you why this is different and better than your generic Ecchi/Harem/Magic/School anime. \r\nFirst of all, the story is not all fanservice. It actually has PLOT. and a damn good one at that. The point that struck me most about this anime in particular regarding the story is that the plot begins quite quickly. Most generic harem anime stories wait until Episode 6, some as late as episode 9 before throwing in the conflict. This one started at episode 3. much better than 4 episodes of useless fanservice.  However, thisstory is not without it's faults. One of the major problems with the story is that it is not very common sense. The characters seem to make decisions that don't make sense, and thus leads to plot holes. But overall story is very good. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, each character is great. They do fit well with the story. It doesn't seem as if this harem setting was the main reason for this anime, as the harem slowly develops and almost in an underhanded manner. Also, props to the storywriters for making a good MC who is not as dense as bricks. Yes, this MC is perverted, but he is (1) not shy about it, and (2) not shy about making/taking advances from the girls. That puts it about 5 steps ahead of a generic harem anime. So Characters get a solid 10/10 in my book because badass MC and girls who serve another purpose other than just being objects for the MC to play with/ignore. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem (personally) with this anime other than the story not following at times is the art, but only a small part of it. In particular the faces. I'm not sure what it is but something to do with the way the eyes are drawn and the mouths are draw irks me. Also, as most of the story happens at the magic school, so most of the colors are muted, antiquated, and medieval in a sense.  However this is just a small problem with it and doesnt detract from the overall enjoyment for me. Also there are good looking women/girls so I won't complain anymore. \\n\\n\r\nI happen to like fast songs so the Opening and the closing were real treats for me, I found myself listening to them more than once (usually i skip them). \\n\\n\r\nOverall, a great anime. Characters do follow tropes, but they vary from each other in age, height, and (not to be shallow) bust size, in addition to having a purpose. The MC is great since he is actually perceptive of the girls that like him, and is not afraid to act on those inferences. Fanservice is present, but not overt once the plot begins, and the fanservice does not intrude on the plot at all. Art is crisp and sharp, although some facial features look to be off on some of the characters. Overall 9/10. To break it down, 2 for ecchi/fanservice/art  + 2 for plot + 3 for characters +2 for enjoyment equals 9/10. \\n\\n\r\nNow to compare to the one and only, ever present, benchmark of High school Dxd, since this is probably one of the few harem ecchi animes that can do battle with DxD. So, extra review/comparison anime time! yes!\\n\r\n1. MC: Kasuga v Issei: both are very similar. both have a latent power in them, both are openly perverted, and both are the center of their respective harems. however I have to give the edge here to Kasuga since it seems as if he is much more aware of the affection he is receiving. Issei is also aware but probably either has the biggest set of blue balls in the world because he doesn't know what to do, or is just plain dumb. \\n\r\n2. Best girl for MC (personal opinion): Lilith v Rias: again both are similar. Both have red hair, both are powerful, and both are hot hot hot. But here the advantage probably goes to Rias. Although I personally think that Lilith is the hotter one, Rias' motivation and drive is a bit more than Lilith's despite both girls liking the MC about the same. In Rias' case it's Issei's idiocy that prevents little demon children from spawning. \\n\r\n3. Story: waiting for more seasons from trinity seven, but comparing season 1 to season 1, I'd give trinity seven the edge here, just because trinity seven moves at a much faster pace, which gave us some more story. Honestly this story has a greater plot than HSDXD. It has a good story with a good premise whereas it seems that DXD was just made so the producers could draw as many tits as possible\\n\r\n4. Fanservice: waiting for uncensored Trinity Seven to make an unbiased judgement, but i think its on par to DxD\\n\\n\r\nPeace",

            "content": "Harem is a fickle genre where ratings seem to be solely decided on how many girls and how much fan service you can fit into one episode. Don't get me wrong: Trinity Seven is a typical harem anime and you can expect such tropes to appear in every episode you watch. However, unlike many other harem anime, it does not detract from the enjoyment from the show and instead adds a rather fresh element by embracing the very tropes that define the harem genre. \r\nStory: 7/10\r\nAs par with many other harem/supernatural anime, the plot and what drives it is on shaky ground. Kasuga Arata, theprotagonist, dives into the world of magic after it consumed his childhood friend and cousin, Kasuga Hijiri. The plot is not developed enough to immerse the audience yet it has enough background to confuse the readers with how or why magic works the way it should. Perhaps it was limited due to the constraint of 12 episodes. Perhaps the plot could have been better fleshed out. Regardless, Trinity Seven started strong and ended aptly with enough room for a second season. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art is easy on the eyes and every heroine is understandably cute. The fight effects were well polished and animated wonderfully. Every character felt unique - even with those with similar appearances. Every individual had a rather distinct set of eyes and added to the personality of such characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nFor a 12 episode anime, I was rather surprised at how much effort was put into the soundtrack. With an apt opening theme and an astounding 4 different ending themes, Trinity Seven had seamless variety that added to the value of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nIt is refreshing to see how every character felt so distinct with their own set of personalities. Trinity Seven's cast knew it was in the harem genre and embraced it.  I looked forward to seeing Arata interact with the various heroines of the show. Arata has motive, drive, and an unflinchingly perverted desire towards the rest of the cast. Most of all, he deviates from the usual harem protagonist by having a backbone and becoming proactive towards his goals - something that makes me genuinely like the main character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nEvery episode was amusing to watch and didn't go overboard with harem clich\u00e9s. I looked forward to watching the characters interact with each other. And while the plot was not impeccable, it certainly had enough depth for me to keep watching, wanting to know more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nI overall enjoyed Trinity Seven and what it brought to the table - a harem genre with its strong cast of characters that may or may not take themselves seriously.",

I would normally write a long review but I think this could be summarized with a pros/cons list.\r\nPros:\r\n-Excellent art and character design, a diverse cast with bright and vibrant colors. This anime looks good.\r\n-A good cast of characters that includes all of your favorite tropes done well and with enough subtlety to make them unique.\r\n-An AMAZING soundtrack. This is one I will be putting onto the MP3 player in it's entirety.\r\n-A solid ending (minus the OVA) that leaves theviewer with enough info to decide if they want to read the manga or a solid ending for those who want a one and done.\\n\r\n-Fan service done right (in your face but PG13 rating so it could be funny without being too distracting).\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-As often seen in these 1 season magic based anime... I don't know how anything works. How does magic work, why were the grimores ignored the second half of the season, how did MC learn all the skills.\\n\r\n-Anticlimactic \"boss fight\" at the end that resolves far too quickly. MC should have hulked out and done some crazy stuff but instead just meh.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is an 8/10. It excelled in art/sound, fell a bit short on story but was very good all around.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I feel it is only fair to write a review of an anime I initially dropped because I thought it was so bad.\r\nWhen this anime first aired I watched up to episode 3, then dropped it when they revealed the main characters \"super-power\" because it was so cliched.  Then I decided to re-watch a few weeks ago and boy am I glad I did.\r\nSo here's the rundown.  This is a harem anime.  Usually I dislike harem anime's, especially when they use dumb cliches like 'hand on the boob' on the first episode, or when the main guy is always somehow seeing thegirls panties and then making excuses while blushing intensely.  \\n\\n\r\nSo what makes this anime different?\\n\\n\r\nThe main character.  He owns that he is a pervert, and expresses a desire to sleep with every beautiful girl he sees.  As you do.  Now is this creepy?  Yeah, but the way he owns it somehow makes it okay.  Also, the girls are, for the most part, totally okay with it.  In fact, there are only 2 girls that do the typical screeching-punch/slap thing when the guy touches their boobs or sees them naked.  The rest are like, okay I think you are hot/awesome and I'm interested.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nGood bordering on very good.  I feel like the series has a lot of potential, and I am hoping a second season will wrap everything up.  Is everything explained perfectly?  Nope, but thats okay, I feel like you get just enough of a taste to be on board and feel like you are invested.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nNothing special but not too shabby either.  Lots of boobs and cleavage, as you would expect with this sort of anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThis really stood out to me.  A beautiful OST accompanied this anime, with tracks that perfectly matched with scenes and action.  Was creepy at the appropriate times and beautiful at others.  Also the voice actors did a great job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nAlso a stand out category.  Each girl is totally different, which is somewhat unique in a harem situation.  By the end of the season you feel like you know each character and will no doubt have favorites (mine was the ninja!)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime.  I'm actually not sure why because like I said, I don't typically watch harem anime's, and when I do I usually don't enjoy them that much.  But I think the great characters and beautiful OST really helped a lot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nI feel like I should give this an 8, but it really isn't that good of a series, I just happened to enjoy it a lot.  I think that if you give harem's a chance and like fantasy/magic anime, you will probably like this show.",

She's a really funny kuudere.\r\nStory\r\nToo many things left unexplained. The magic system is not clear enough and I didn't know what was going on most ofthe time. How to obtain powers is sort of unclear and what makes you powerful is also. \\n\r\nThe main guy is looking for his childhood friend but their relationship is poorly shown so it's really hard to connect with MC's goal. I felt like the show skipped explaining some things and forgot about character representation and development.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6 (but ti probably deserves less)",

The main protagonist is pretty compelling since he seems to embrace his love of women rather than being dense about it as usual. That being said, there is an insane amount of fanservice in this show, just something to be aware of before diving in.\r\nThe basic premise is a boy attends a majority women school to learn magecraft in order to save his cousin from unknown forces. In reality this just gives him excuse to grope every classmate he has while he essentially can't lose on the way down.\r\nMostly whatthis show seems to excel in is just being fun. It's nothing to take or attack to seriously, and it really doesn't need to try that hard. I see why it only got one season, but if you're just looking for something to laugh and pass the time this show isn't a bad idea.",

It definitely had the potential to be an awesome magic anime, but I think it should've been longer. I think that if there was more time for character development and a more solid plot, it would've hit its mark, but with only 12 eps, it just falls a little short...I still recommend it, despite that.7/10",

            "content": "KEKMARTS MADE ME DO IT\r\nTRINITY FUCKING SEVEN CAN GO TO JOLLY PIRATE DONUTS AND TAKE A TWO-HOUR SHIT FOR ALL I CARE!\r\nActually, it just failed to impress me on several fronts, didn\u2019t introduce hardly anything original or groundbreaking to the genre, but still somehow kept itself more than mildly entertaining. I\u2019d consider this show a time waster, a motivator to finish it seeing as its so short, but not doing anything else except presenting the viewer with ways to defend something similar to T7 that they enjoy (by pointing out the faults of this series) and not be bored in discovering that. \r\nWhile it managesto avoid and even poke fun of some of the tropes common in the genre, (such as with some infrequent 4th wall humor and a perverted, much braver than normal ecchi/harem protagonist) it doesn\u2019t manage to actually be interesting or different quite enough to garner itself as a \u201cbreakthrough for the genre.\u201d It still has boring side characters, unnecessarily overdone humor, and predictable fights. You basically can already know this show because you\u2019ve probably seen it a thousand times by now, it\u2019s that common anime setting of \u201cmagicky magicky high school,\u201d with the use of complex and elaborate terms (e.g. Breakdown Phenomenon, Demon Lord Candidate, etc.) and Gothic RPG styled lore and art design. Also, clothes disintegrating. And titty grabbing. Lots and lots of titty grabbing.\\n\\n\r\n-pause for effect-\\n\\n\r\nHowever, a nice breath of fresh air for a series such as Trinity Seven was the protagonist Arata. As I\u2019ve stated above, and I\u2019m sure, as many of you are aware, harems have a habit of having just a downright shitty main character. He\u2019s usally a wuss and a pussy, and he\u2019s just as embarrassed by all the tits flying out of their bras as the girls attached to them are. Arata manages to take that trope and flip it around by being a straight up horny pervert, and it\u2019s great to see that done more in a harem.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, despite that trait he still falls under the trope of being a bit of a boring, one stroke main character. Even his physical appearance is dull and drab, with messy black hair and nothing else striking visually, I could name probably ten other shonen protags that look just like him, and sound like him even.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as for the girls in his harem, there\u2019s literally only one interesting one. This girl that actually is a joy, however, depends on whom you ask but it seems to be unanimous from the other reviews on this site that there is only \u201cone.\u201d I\u2019m not even going to bother listing their forgettable names, as the show did such a bad job of building these characters that I\u2019d need to Google them anyway. You can basically know them by Tig Ol\u2019 Bitties, Pigtail Jailbait, (a common character, if I do say so myself) No-Tits-No-Expression, Ninjagurl, Waifubait, Tsundere, Lolicon, and \u201cI-don\u2019t-have-enough-screen-time-to-actually-have-a-fun-nickname.\u201d What more could you ask for? \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s almost nothing to say about the music of the series, either. The series theme, \u201cSeven Doors\u201d by ZAQ is everything you\u2019d expect it to be for a Gothic Harem Fantasy. Seriously, just saying those three words should already paint a picture of the Opening, and for that matter, the soundtrack altogether. Guitar riffs, chantish (engrish) vocals. Not that that\u2019s a bad thing. \\n\\n\r\nAnd visually, this show is unimpressive. Not bad, not bad at all, but it doesn\u2019t have the level of detail or specifically unique design Seven Arcs has created.\\n\\n\r\nWait.\\n\\n\r\n*looks at track record of Seven Arcs*\\n\\n\r\nThey\u2019ve literally made nothing notable. Sekirei? Seriously?\\n\\n\r\nIs that it?\\n\\n\r\nOh hey, they did Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha! Okay, well I guess saying that they\u2019ve not done much isn\u2019t fair of me but it sure looks that way. 29 isn\u2019t a huge number.\\n\\n\r\nEither way, visually the anime is muted and dark, with the vibrancy in colors a bit toned down, like a tad of gray or a dull off-white was added to the overall value in postproduction. A good way to describe the color in the some of the backgrounds (especially the walls of the school in certain scenes) is comparing it to a little sprite from the 4th gen Pokemon games. There\u2019s an item you can find in the Haunted Chateau called \u201cOld Gateau.\u201d It\u2019s literally a brick of pudding-cake and it\u2019s a brown/maroonish color. A picture of it can be found here;\\n\\n\r\nwww.serebii.net/itemdex/oldgateau.shtml\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n-\tTwo or three likable characters\\n\r\n-\tA strong start\\n\r\n-\tNot boring, most likely due to its pace and style of humor\\n\r\nMIXED:\\n\r\n-\tEcchi without nips. Take that how you will\\n\r\n-\tSelf-aware Harem. See above\\n\r\n-\tYet another unconcluded 12 episode show with a \u201cgo read the manga\u201d ending. This is good because it can continue this way and possibly get better, but bad because, well, you gotta wait and see if it\u2019s gonna happen or not\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n-\tNot quite inventive enough to give it too much of an edge over other series similar to it\\n\r\n-\tMany unfinished and somewhat dull-feeling concepts in the way of Magic and lore\\n\r\n-\tLiterally every other character in the show\\n\r\n-\tCharacters cockblocking other characters. Seriously, fuck off\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nWatch it if you want to. I\u2019m not gonna stop you, its a bit above average at best. \\n",

Totally would rate it PG-13 -_-. Nevermind, this, regardless of the hotter scenes ( \u0361~ \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) , had terrible action sequences and the story is simplystic as it could get. No fun, \"epic\" music and \"badass\" characters facing eachother and all they do in that usually 5. min \"action\" seqence takes 90% talking how good they are, or their skills. I know this scenery is in every action/harem anime but this is new meta...\r\nSo, if you wantto know story read the synopsis on this then or go watch the anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nAs I said the story is simplystic. Basicaly what happened: Something goes wrong, our main characters \"cousin\" (the \" \" was on purpose), was sucked by that \"goes wrong\" thing and he (BTW his name is Arata, and her (\"cousins\") name is Hijiri) goes on route to save her, which includes going on magical school.\\n\r\nSimply.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nWell, nothing bad. Its not masterpiece, but I actually liked it. But why not 9 then? Because if some characters that have been repeatedly addressed as kawaii by Arata started to look kawaii in middle of the season, then... No 9/10... Still most kawaii character is non titan slaying ninja Levi :3...\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nIt wasnt something that touched me but my ears didnt bleeded either...\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nI dont know what to say... but I know that rating is accurate (If you calculate in every character in this anime). Still Im suprised by behavior of some characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\n8 because of some hotter scenes, if you know what I mean ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0). I assure you, if you are (reader, that means you) man, this will not leave you bored...\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think, the studio could do better work on story, but for some viewer that is OK because... you know what...\\n\r\n*(my favorite character is headmaster, he will not leave the scene without you laughting)*",

            "content": "-TL;DR REVIEWS-\r\nTl;dr - Harem anime (with magic!) in a school setting. Worth a watch? Sure. I didn't expect much from this anime but was pleasantly surprised.\r\n[STORY - 7] - Arata, the protagonist, has a close friend, Hijiri, vanish in air for unknown reasons. He's like WTF! The protagonist then gets enrolled into a magic academy (I don't really understand how, it was poorly explained) and begins on his quest to get Hijiri back. But to do so, he must build his harem first (and learn magic along the way).\r\n[ART - 7] - It's okay. Nothing spectacular. There's fanservice, if you're into it. A lot offanservice.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTERS - 9] Strong score for this anime. Protagonist has an actual personality, while not being too wimpy (generic MC) or too badass (Kirito-kun). The supporting cast (the Trinity Seven) all display unique personalities which was fundamental in a score of 9.\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT - 8] - Honestly, I enjoyed it. I wanted something that'd give me a laugh with some sort of romantic/comedic element and got it. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL - 7] - It was good. \\n\r\nWas it great? Not really. \\n\r\nShould you watch it?

            "content": "Ok, I'm gonna make this as short and simple as possible without spoiling anything.\r\nStory (6) - A bit messy at the start but cleans itself up after the the first two episodes. Story is quite straightforward once it straightens itself out but still leaves us the question as to whether theres more to it.\r\nArt (9) - If theres something the series does right its the art and look of it. Every episode is very enjoyable to look at and even some of the more boring scenes are made up for by the good looking art and animation. Oh and those actions, god damn.\r\nSound (7) -Voice acting was decent and I really didn't have a problem with it at all. Also some really nice opening and ending songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7) - Alright, boobs and body figures aside, the characters were the typical variety of personalities you would see in any harem series. That is EXCEPT for the main character. Now what I liked about this series was that the MC was different to the usual harem leads you would see. This character isn't thick skulled when it comes to relationships and doesn't get a nose bleed whenever a girl touches him. In fact he does the opposite and knows when a girl likes him and knows how to act when a girl offers themselves up to him. He is a very self controlled and likeable character and the only reason why I raised the score up to a 7.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9) - If you like the harem/ecchi genre, then you'll LOVE this series. If your sick and tired of the MC in a harem getting a nose bleed every 5 seconds then you'll LOVE this series. If you like comedy in general then I think you'll like this series also. But if you don't like the harem genre then you probably shouldn't watch this...\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8) - Tbh, I enjoyed every moment of watching this series and it is indeed one of my guilty pleasures. Only downside to this is if you DON'T like excessive fan service and/or the harem genre in general. Other than that I think this is a real diamond in the bush if your a fan of the harem or ecchi genre.",

            "content": "Well, it's happened again.  I've gone into a show with no expectations, only to find a surprising little gem that's somewhat outside what I would consider my typical fare.  Unlike with some other options, Trinity Seven does at least somewhat advertise as something with elements that I would want \u2013 the story of Arata, a relative nobody who seeks out magical power only to turn out to be fairly awesome, is pretty cliched and has been done a lot of times, but some of those times it's been done smartly, and I'm something of a sucker for smart and/or stylish fantasy worlds, thelikes of which such a premise will often serve up.\\n\\n\r\nI was not, however, prepared for how far into Ecchi this show goes.  It's not just having the occasional \u201charem comedy\u201d moment or designs for the female characters that are focused on their assets, it's a pretty constant barrage of non-explicit nudity and grabbed boobs, with a pervy attitude from our lead to encourage the matter beyond what the writers could have contrived on their own.  It gets... awkward.  And shame-inducing.  And the show puts its worst foot forward, where the first couple episodes don't have a ton else going for them (or so you might think) other than the Ecchi/Harem game.\\n\\n\r\nBut, I decided to see the show through to the end, and I'm glad I did.  While some works will use fanservice aspects alongside plot without the two really interacting outside of maybe one or two moments, and others will even attempt to use an avalanche of fanservice to replace actually having a good story and compelling character, Trinity Seven manages to actually use its ecchi moments in a constructing manner, springboarding through jokes to interesting characterization and an actually somewhat compelling story.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is... really good.  Counting Arata, there are at least nine major characters you have to keep track of for this show.  Some of them are pretty one-note jokes (looking at you, Arin) but more of them... aren't.  The girls, and their relationships with our lead, become more and more realized over the course of the show, and none of them, not even the most thinly sketched, is entirely bereft of a personality outside of their visual design.  Lieselotte, Mira, and Lilith go a step beyond, where I think they could hold their own as interesting people even divorced from their current narrative magnetism.  Hijiri, Levi, and Akio aren't far behind.  They're memorable characters, and not at all because they're sometimes rendered nude by their circimstances.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, the Ecchi elements actually add in.  I'll use Mira as an example \u2013 because of Ecchi/Harem antics, she and Arata get off on the wrong foot, and she initially forms a negative opinion of him, meaning that they have a hard time at first when circumstances force them to work together.  In those circumstances, Mira ends up depowered and disrobed (it makes sense in context), and starts to bond with Arata because... he's a reasonable person and not a one-note slimeball, so he shows some character and humanity by treating her situation with decency and respect.  This also goes to show the audience how serious the predicament the characters are in is, because normally Arata would at least take the opportunity to make a crack or two, but in this case he doesn't, and it feels natural that he doesn't.  They have a chance to talk about their thoughts, feelings, and problems like reasonable people, and you can actually believe that they start to form a stronger positive bond that's later necessary to help overcome the challenges they face.\\n\\n\r\nHere, fanservice hasn't been served up alongside the plot and it's not trying to replace the plot; it's there, and not going anywhere, but it's fully integrated and actually kind of beautifully woven together.  The awkward Ecchi sequences, rather than existing half outside of continuity, can be springboards for character comedy, legitimate drama, and even sometimes poignant moments.  This kind of material is everywhere in Trinity Seven, particularly as the show goes on, and it makes what could have been a mindless exercise in titillation actually something greater, something that I'm glad has a continuing story because I'm actually looking forward to more of it.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the main story?  That's again, more interesting and involved than it had to be.  It's got some over-the-top cheesy bits (I think the Biblia Academy might be the only fictional school-for-specials with a worse Academics and Safety track record than Professor Xavier's School for the Gifted) but it also has intriguing elements, some legitimate moments of suspense, and interesting worldbuilding with a clever take on the nature of magic (which ties back to exploring the inner feelings of characters) and a good conflict between the main heroes and the antagonists that emerge, which is grounded in a topic of legitimate enough import to warrant the conflict in the show with a nature sufficiently two-sided that while we're rooting for the heroes we don't fail to see the villains as reasonable beings with something of a point to their actions and legitimate motivations with a goal that non-insane individuals could be seen supporting.\\n\\n\r\nIn that, Trinity Seven is actually a surprising rarity.  Despite presenting a rather immature face to the world, if you're willing to look a little closer it actually treats its story with far more serious weight than many other shows do.  Villains aren't just evil for the sake of being evil or because they're insane, and while our protagonists are certainly hooked into themes that run very deep in their world, there's a palpable sense of a conflict that predates them and isn't predicated entirely on THIS incarnation, right now, as being uniquely special.  It's the one were' watching, and the only one these characters can interact with, but in a way it's a good thing that the grand conflict is about what the heroes are and not who they are while the more immediate conflicts are all about who the characters are rather than what.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a very stylish show, too.  The voice acting and music, though nothing really special on their own, help support the necessary mood swings and strong characters and action, and the designs... I'll try to avoid saying too much about the Ecchi elements \u2013 the leading ladies are very much all easy on the eyes, as they should be \u2013 but the art is good in general.  The characters have well-defined designs and look good and also (except where intentional) distinctive in a variety of different modes, which also help convey the nature of the moment.  The animation flows well, and there's a decent artistry to the use of magic in the show that helps it feel like it has some weight to it.  The visual creativity for spellcraft isn't the best here, but it's also not too shabby, and you can look at some of Trinity Seven's magic in action and kind of tell what the spell does and probably how strong it is in a relative sense based on how it looks.  The action is on the good end of run-of-the-mill \u2013 it's not really epic, but there is some creative intelligence to it and a basic understanding that it's more interesting when brains as well as (arcane) brawn plays a part in conflict.\\n\\n\r\nSCORE BREAKDOWN\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nTotal: 8\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: Trinity Seven is better written than it has any right to be, and has earned my respect because of it.  If you just can't tolerate Ecchi, you might want to give the show a pass, but if you're willing to give Trinity Seven the time it needs to grow into something bigger and better than what it looks like at first glance, I would wholeheartedly recommend it.",

            "content": "Trinity Seven\r\nFrom the title you can probably see the theme has to do with the concept of the 7 Deadly Sins, but in this case, as magical arts through the 7 Archives as well as your individual 'Thema,' (basically Class and Sub-class).  So without further adieu, let's begin this review!\r\nAnimation\r\nThe visuals in this show are quite appealing, both the animation of each individual character and the settings and backgrounds alike.  The lighting and shading as well help to invoke the feeling of every scene.  Sometimes background images and characters however can be either highly distorted or have a dramatic lack of animation,but nothing too serious.  Otherwise, I would compare the style of animation, especially character-wise to that of the anime DanMachi, however, I would say it is not as good, or in-depth.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the first episode of Trinity Seven, I admittedly had no clue what was going on.  Nothing about what was occurring within the plot-line was really explained, not even a little.  It did have an over-looming objective that the main character, Arata wished to accomplish, but nothing about the setting, people, events, etc. were really explained in the first episode, let alone the next few.  For being a 12 episode season, I felt that this was a definite issue with the series as a whole because I felt like I had to search for the meanings to things that I didn't completely understand all too often.  Also, I felt the progression of events within the plot went wayyyyyyyy too quickly.  I would say it is almost comparable to that of the Aincrad arc of Sword Art Online where everything felt extremely rushed and as though a lot of details and plot elements were missing.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself wasn't that bad, and nothing really stood out as being inappropriate for the plot-line, I was simply left wanting a lot more out of the 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThe music used in the show is absolutely fantastic.  That being said, there were definitely scenes where the choice of music was probably not the best (Ex. episode 3 the bath scene).  Otherwise, the moods of most scenes were captured brilliantly and sounded wonderful.  With regards to the voice acting, the only thing I have to say is that it was pretty good.  Every voice suited their character nicely, especially Arata's (Arata is voiced by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka who also happens to voice the main protagonist of DanMachi, Bell Cranel).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nAhh, the characters, possibly the most prevalent and amazing aspect of this show...  is what I would say if I felt there was any real character development other than with Arata.  I may rant a little here so bear with me.  The main protagonist is technically meant to be the most important character in a show, especially when a plot point states that each Trinity Seven becomes the harem of the Demon Lord Candidate, but when there is little to no real development of any other characters, whom I might add are considered main characters, I get a little annoyed.  I understand that this show has the Harem genre to it, but that doesn't mean the other main characters can't have more story than falling for the protagonist.  This whole lack of development really reminds me of Sword Art Online, which if you've seen the series, you probably understand what I'm getting at.  \\n\\n\r\nAlthough, where the series lacks in development, it does not come up short in each characters individuality.  As magic is basically the main theme of Trinity Seven, it's not surprising that each individual has their own unique style and way of using it, but the characters that fit each style, simply make sense...  in a very good way.  Each character is what you would think of them as, and they absolutely excel at there skills, which is quite enjoyable to see.  Overall, their appearance and actions are pretty cool.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict!!\\n\\n\r\nSo, should you watch this series?  Yes.  Trinity Seven, overall, was enjoyable to watch.  Though it had its fair share of mishaps I would still recommend it to someone to at least experience, if nothing else.  Especially when considering its opening, because holy s*** is it good.  I mean, resemblance to Death Note much?\\n\\n\r\nThis series was fun to watch and has some great comedic elements as well, believe me, there are some REALLY funny scenes.  So yeah, I'd say give it a try.",

Though the build up and the journey through the story is interesting and packed with good one liners, the ending feels empty. If you want a full experience, you need to read the manga, which is still ongoing. The story is well paced, but it lacks the details of the world. Especially the magic part, which gets a little explanation and puts absurd names upon it. This amount of detailsputs me in a half dead brain mode, where everything works because it has to be that way. Its missing the meat from the dinner. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  \\n\r\nThe reason to engage in this anime is the main character. He puts the story and dialog in a new perspective. A self-aware and a witty playful character that enjoys teasing the female characters. Although he has the over powered shounen abilities, he puts them in a \u0093\"good\"\u0094 use. The female are another reason to engage this anime. Its true that they follow a haremicly stylized characters, but they have their moments to shine. And those moments when they shine, puts the character in place for each girl.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Since I started once again watching anime with english subs to improve my english I though that making some reviews would help me improving my vocabulary, first thing I though was to complete some old animes I stopped watching not because I dislike them but just for the reason I was too lazy to complete them. They didn't get all my attention so I just stopped watching them and hoping one day I'd get that bored to watch them. The day came. I completed the series and... I feel bad.\r\nThe first series I completed were Mayo Chiki and this one, Harem 7... err... Trinity 7.\r\nThemain plot of the story (not having in mind the harem which is around the male protagonist) was really interesting to even complete the anime. Thing I am not used to since I used to hate almost every anime I watch at the beginning. But, I believe the harem and those things are necessary. The only thing I can say about the story itself it's that it can't be better. I really though about many things that could improve the story but there's no way you can put in a better way a story in which a boy wanna rescue his girl and gets involve in a harem of fighting-hot girls.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty amusing to watch. Next to the sound in which I can't even save the opening nor ending. I can't really say I watched this 'ecchi' because of her boobs. Actually 'their' boobs were pretty shit. ay.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way. I don't remember any song and I have completed the anime 2 hours ago.\\n\\n\r\nI mostly enjoyed the anime because of the characters. There are a lot of types of character which I mostly enjoyed, some tsunderes, unnatural girls like Levi or Akio (actually these 2 girls where the most enjoyable to watch in many reasons, believe me, I'm sick), the main character which has a uncommon power of evil that make him able to see pussies everytime he wants (SO UNCOMMON).\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would say if you don't mind a bit of fanservice, you like boobs, and you wanna a not really bad plot and funny characters this may be your anime. Bad thing it wasn't mine but after all my explanations I hope you get a bit interested to watch this one.\\n\\n\r\n*If there's any mistake with any word or just some grammar mistakes, please notice me as fast as you read the review and I'll try my best fixing it.",

I mean it's a very fun anime, but it's not good enough to make you start liking ecchi or something. Anyway, for those who have intention of going for this one, let me encourage you. I won't spoil anything.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nA guy whose cousin disappeared one day decided to learn magic to get her back. Then he went to a magic school, where he met the Trinity Seven AND where his real story began... To be honest, the story is notreally impressive. It has some flaws, it's weird, it doesn't really have anything outstanding. You will find awkward and funny moments along with VERY VERY stupid situations and you have to wonder: \"Wtf, why won't they attack instead of talking\". However, in the end, the story is truly enjoyable and I say that you may want to give it a try.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art is good, but not quite impressive. You will find most anime today, 2014, have similar art level and some shows have even better art. Don't expect anything memorable from the art of this show because it's just enough for you to enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nTotally personal experience: I don't find any of the songs catchy so I will give it a 7.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nSeriously, you will have a hard time finding a second female main character like in Trinity Seven: Arata Kasuga. Besides the fact that he is a very caring and nice person, he is perverted, kind of like obvious in an ecchi anime, but he doesn't hesitate to show it out. Also, he is NOT stupid. He knows that the girls have feelings for him and he is willing to accept it.\\n\r\nAlso, Lilith Asami is a very cute girl :D\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI have to say I really enjoy it. It's not an outstanding anime, it may not get your intention, but I like it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nBUT +1 due to the fact that I have a good time watching the show.\\n\r\n---\\n\r\nGive the show a try and make the judgement on your own. The show's worth it.",

An MC with confidence who's not afraid of pussy!\r\nLong reviews waste your time, so here's one short paragraph. \r\nTS has a very distorted magic system that's not much to care for. The music is nothing special. The plot is pretty lame. However, the MC makes this anime shine. The dude is not afraid of women and he's loaded with sly comments on the subject. There is a tiny bit of fanservice and it's highly censored so they don't draw nipples. The cast of women is very nice and I've heard some voice acting complaints. Let me just say that there is no problems withthe voice acting and all characters voices fit the characters fine. Thank god they didn't include some brat character with pigtails that slaps the MC every 47 seconds. All in all, TS is a good anime sprinkled with fanservice and loaded with comedy. \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Funny as hell.\\n\r\n-Medium fanservice.\\n\r\n-Confident MC who's not afraid of women.\\n\r\n-Great voice acting.\\n\r\n-Great character cast.\\n\r\n-Decent soundtrack. \\n\r\n-No loud brat/sister with pigtails archetype. \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Confusing magic system.\\n\r\n-Mediocre story. \\n\r\n-High censorship.\\n\r\n-No nipples.",

This show doesn't do that, the main storyline is actually pretty good considering what genre it is. The art is also pretty good as well (especially the magic) and it fits like a glove with some of the fight scenes in the anime. The soundtrack is fucking awesome especially the opening; the soundtrack really helps to emphasize a certain feel and actually sounds like some effort was put intoit (*cough* himouto umaru chan *cough*). Character design is fairly decent, I especially like the protagonist with how he handles the perverted situations since it gives off a breath of fresh air. Overall my enjoyment was really good, I suggest watching the series if you're looking for a series that knows it's silly/goofy and has a good sense of humor. I really enjoyed this show and it's probably the only harem/ecchi I actually enjoyed watching which is why I gave it an 8. It can differ though!",

Personally, I would say Sloth.  And which sin summarizes this anime?  Well, if it isn't Lust, it's also Sloth.\r\nScore Synopsis:\r\nStory - 4\r\nArt - 7\r\nSound - 10\r\nCharacter - 5\r\nEnjoyment - 6\r\nOverall - 32/5 = 6.4 = 6\r\nStory - 4\r\nTo say the least, the first episode was quite interesting and very promising.  From this, I expected a story filled with mystery, action, and potential characterdevelopment.  Sadly, such expectations were not entirely met.  The issue lies in the method of explanations and fanservice.  Although I was thankful that this anime explained all magic related topics in great detail, the issue was that said explanations took too long and, for that reason, became a little complicated.  If I recall, I think half of some episodes were explanation alone, making much of the episodes a bit boring considering my initial expectations.  And what was happening when it wasn't boring?  It was perverted.  Given the protagonist's personality, he didn't waste any time to turn a conversation into something sexual.  And, like the explanations, these scenarios went for a long time.  As for the action, the fights were very short and anticlimactic given the protagonist's overpowered abilities, the constant dialog, and abrupt endings.  The biggest disappointment was itself with a very short and boring fight coupled with the fact that half of this episode (spoilers) suddenly becomes a \"normal\" day, completely destroying the tension the show built up to at that point.  In a nutshell, what wasn't slightly complicated was perverse.  If you're looking for a story driven anime, look somewhere else.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7\\n\r\nThe fighting animations, as short as they were, were actually well done and the constant dark lighting definitely helps to set the mood, whether it's for the dark serious tones or the sexually-hinted tones.  And believe me, this is an upside considering the fact that you'll be looking at the same scenario for a long time.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nNow, THIS is something to praise this anime for!  Even though this is only a 12 episode show, there are 5 endings that are not only catchy but also spirit lifting (although, this show really isn't dark enough to you to require spirit lifting).  As for the one opening, it's intense drive definitely gets your blood pumping to build up for the assumed \"tension\" that the episodes would provide.  Even if \"Trinity Seven\" isn't your cup of tea, I would still recommend listening to its music on your own time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5\\n\r\nAlthough there is some changes in fighting prowess for the protagonist, that's literally the only development that exists in this show.  The protagonist is openly perverted but an otherwise cool character, making the harem vibe a bit unique and, depending on your tastes, appealing for a lead role.  However, with his battles being boring and his personality slowly becoming a running gag, his personality might lose its luster to some viewers, myself included.  As for the female characters...sadly there isn't much to say.  The only two purposes they had, in my opinion, were to either power up the protagonist or to provide fanservice.  Otherwise, their backgrounds, personalities, and overall contribution to the plot felt quite irrelevant.  Sadly, this anime is more character driven than plot driven and that's not saying much.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6\\n\r\nI must admit, the first few episodes seemed very promising and I did enjoy the protagonist's unique personality (at least for a harem lead) for the majority of the show.  However, as the series went on, the same perverse content, short and boring battles, and the constant long explanations got to me and made me lose interest quickly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6\\n\r\nIf you want intense battles, character development, more action and less talking, this anime isn't for you.  However, if you like a detailed magic system, a constant ecchi/harem vibe, and a unique lead, I would recommend this to you.  Granted, I wasn't too happy with the outcome, but the overall show, looking back on it, had lots of potential.  It was simply wasted potential.  Hopefully the upcoming movie will do better.",

I suggest watching this with an open mind for this is one of the best harem anime out there. \r\nThe MC Arata is perverted and admits it. He has the guts to do and say what most harem MC don't. The heroines are not well rounded, however there are pluses. The girls are all different and they go through character development throughout the anime. The downside is that if all the personalities of the heroines were combined into one girlthen that girl would be the best girl ever. Sadly it's not like that. Each girl is different and that's what I like. \\n\\n\r\nWatching this anime, you need to consider being open minded. The pacing is a bit rushed sometimes, but the story is well explained. Don't rush through and read every subtitle. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the artwork is not too shabby. I think it was low budget to start out so be mindful. The Characters are great. Story is well explained. Enjoyment is that I found myself laughing and feeling every emotion along with the MC and Female MCs. So must Watch.",

I\u2019ve been watching a lot of anime as of late, where the subjects deal with a lot of harem material, and this show in particular makes it much more than that. The lead character in particular (Arata) doesn\u2019t seem like the male character that goofs up when it comes to being perverted. He leads by being the master of grimorie magic and more importantly he cares about his cousin, Hijiri. In first viewing, the middle half of the series does seem to feel a little clunky, but the jokesare what keep this show entertaining. The supporting characters like Lilith, Mira and Akio keep the show fresh, and they\u2019re also the reason as to why this score is given. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime would feel best if you were to able to (literally) separate fantasy and reality, and realize that this isn\u2019t just about a harem. It\u2019s the first male character that does not feel like a stooge for just being pervy on women. This show was a real good one, through and through.",

            "content": "I'll just get straight to the point: it's your typical ecchi/harem with magic and powers and such. This would've been a mediocre show if not for the two elements that blended together perfectly.\r\nTo start off, let's talk about the plot. Again, your typical ecchi/harem plot where an ordinary boy meets an extraordinary girl and they fight off anything that stands against them, all the while doing pervy stuff with other girls. I guess the only difference is that the MC already had a love interest in the beginning and fate is just cruel for toying with their relationship.\r\nHeroines were disposable, in my opinion. The MCwas uncommon, but not unique. I say this because he does stand out, but only because he has a familiar trait shared with a certain character from another ecchi/harem anime.\\n\\n\r\nYes, the plot wasn't that surprising, but the sound and animation was what caught my attention the most. At first, I thought the animation didn't fit in a series full of fanservice, but I was wrong. As I gradually got into the story, it didn't matter if it had fanservice anymore. The reason: The BGM. The background music really complimented the theme of the series. I saw the animation and the music blending together to make the perfect atmosphere. And I've only seen a few shows do that.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it's a decent anime. I wouldn't exactly say it's good because it still didn't catch my attention. If you're into magic and beautiful girls, then I recommend this anime. It's not a new anime, but it at least deserves a (trinity) seven.\\n",

This is definitely a mistake.\r\nStory 5/10\r\nPersonally, I hated the story. It barely stood out to me, and it's not something that will last.

            "content": "Beforehand, I want to say that I had high hopes for this series after hearing that it's a Harem-based Anime that had an actually competent Harem-Lead/Protagonist.\r\nIt didn't disappoint on the Harem aspects of my expectations up until the final episode which seemed to derail the entire point of a Harem in the first place by showing obvious favoritism towards, of course, the \"best looking\"  emotional, jealous, and/or sexually awkward one, who just so happens to also be the first member of the Harem as well.\r\nI don't know how many times I've seen this trope now, but it needs to just stop because it leavesthe Harem obsolete when you can see this happening from the very start and \"sinks every ship\" while they are still under construction in the dock yard, so to speak.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory 3/10: The story is bad and it should feel bad. The story shouldn't be what you are watching this anime for in the first place. Especially after the opening scenes which are virtually the most understandable part of the story to date despite being only 1 episode, if even the full episode long. An important thing to note is that peoples abilities are often inverted from their personality, resulting in differing levels of irony.\\n\\n\r\nDon't read the manga/source material either, because after the events of the anime and OVA it turns into a complete mess. And it almost completely removes the main drawpoint of the series, the Harem-Ecchi, so that it can try to continue the main plot in a way that feels as though it is made up on the spot page-by-page.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: Decent art, especially good when the Ecchi comes into play as the Ecchi is the main drawpoint and therefore gets emphasized. It is also obvious that they reuse scenes and animations at some points, although not to a large detriment.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10: Average, nothing downright terrible or good. Sometimes you get thrown off by a bizarrely poor sound effect(s) and it leaves you reeling in shock or makes you question what you just heard.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10: Most of the characters are entertaining to at least some degree. The most entertaining being the Ecchi or \"Harem Happy\" ones, which is basically all of them but Lilith. A quick description of the main characters:\\n\\n\r\nArata - Protagonist, inherently perverted and admits it. Everybody knows that he wants to save his \"Girlfriend\" Hijiri, but in most cases ignores this fact for their own gains. Great chemistry with Levi.\\n\\n\r\nHijiri - Main love interest and cousin. Not actually his cousin though. Appears to be Arata's Achilles-Heel and is liable to make decisions based around her future.\\n\\n\r\nLilith - Boring prude that ironically has one of the most attractive bodies. Sexually awkward and almost always jealous or embarrassed. Her only key feature for comedy, although it becomes very redundant and old, is her being a literal stalker or otherwise having inexplicable timing to ruin anybodies chances of getting farther with Arata.\\n\\n\r\nArin - Generic Emotionless Albino. Can be funny when she tries to poorly imitate emotion. She is also identical to Hijiri and believes herself to be Arata's destined wife before even meeting him.\\n\\n\r\nLevi the Ninja - One of the best characters in the show. Is willing to do anything to help the Harem-Lead Arata \"get off\" so to speak. Frequently fondles other girls breasts, sabotages their clothing, and suggests/approves perverted ideas. Has some sort of sexual attraction to Arata as well, leading him on with extremely provocative \"word choice\" in the Manga. A Fan Favourite for obvious reasons.\\n\\n\r\nLiese - The older of a pair of twins. She is more \"developed\" and sexually aggressive. Has strong feelings towards Arata because of story events, but gets derailed in her attempts to further their relationship because of a certain someones jealousy.\\n\\n\r\nYui - A loli with large breasts and a big-brother-complex(Instant-Harem-Win). Unlike other characters, she is perfectly fine with being Arata's mistress instead of future wife.\\n\\n\r\nMira - Overly serious and sexually awkward. Closet pervert apparently with conflicting conscious about it. Very conceited.\\n\\n\r\nAkio - The daughter of a nun... what. Not specifically part of Arata's Harem, she is more of a supporting friend.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/0: The anime itself is fairly enjoyable as it never tries to force the nonsensical story and focus's more on the Harem and Ecchi Elements. The story is obviously there to direct the latter elements forward, but it is by no means the main driving force behind wanting to watch this anime whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nIf there is a Season 2, it will be rather disappointing. The story becomes the focus for some reason while at the same time being entire leagues worse, like, what the hell is this worse, and removing a majority of the ecchi/harem elements. It becomes borderline undo-able nonsense past the story arc that gives 2 characters a backstory, 1 good backstory for Akio, and 1 unbelievably-dumb backstory for Lilith that made no sense.\\n\\n\r\nAlso to note is that the ending of the anime starts to derail its own Harem with obvious favoritism. The Manga however does have the upside of subverting the obvious favoritism by leading two of the other characters onto the \"viable ship\".\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10: It was a fairly enjoyable watch, and I actually hope this Anime doesn't get a second season because of the sad state the story arcs that follow are in.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nNow I'm a guy who does love their Harems and fanservice, but that doesn't mean I'll enjoy every aspect of it and this series pretty much showed me how repetitive Harem anime's could get.\r\nThe story begins with Arata Kasuga whose town is destroyed and his cousin Hijiri Kasuga kidnapped, however thanks to a magical grimoire that takes him to the Royal Biblia Academy he meets 7 girls who each represent one of the 7 Deadly Sins and he needs their help.\r\nFirst off this anime was pretty damn boring, it was difficult for me to focus on it since by the time I gotto it, it was the same stuff I have seen before in other anime's that was done better, there were some moments that were fun which were pretty much the fighting scenes, but that was really it to be honest.\\n\r\nIt was kinda interesting learning about the powers and how they worked in this anime, but it didn't keep me hooked for long considering I have seen these kind of powers done in other anime's that did it much better than this and of course as almost every Harem anime that has action it there is a cliffhanger of sorts from what I can remember that obviously set's up sequel which led to the Movie which is debatable whether I'll watch it or not.\\n\\n\r\nNow the main the characters are supposed to be the strongest part for an anime like this, but I really didn't like most of the characters in this show mainly because they were either boring or just annoyed me.\\n\r\nThe female characters consisted of Lilith, Levi, Lieselotte and her sister Selina, Yui, Arin, Mira and Akio whose powers each represent a piece of the 7 deadly sins.\\n\r\nLilith is the leader and has a giant sniper rifle as her weapon of choice plus she is pretty much a Tsundere as she's always giving Arata a hard time especially when he is doing pervy things, but she can be a nice person if given the chance to let her open up.\\n\r\nLevi is a Ninja and mainly relies on her speed to defeat her enemies, she's a bit of a mischievous person and takes a liking to Arata straight away.\\n\r\nLieselotte is an ex member of the trinity seven who went her separate ways after an incident until Arata needed her help for something, she can be a very flirty person and always does this around Arata whenever she see's him.\\n\r\nSelina who is Lieselotte's sister is a student reporter and because her sister is or was a member of the trinity seven is able to get closer to the members and is a bit of a bookworm too hence her higher knowledge of things.\\n\r\nYui is pretty much the cute member of the team and is very different to everyone else, she is considered a special mage and can communicate to others by dreams, she was rescued by Arata and the others which made her grew very fond of him very quickly.\\n\r\nArin is a mysterious girl who shows very little emotion and after being seen nude in the baths by Arata she immediately makes him her arranged husband and over time she does show more emotions thanks to Arata's actions.\\n\r\nMira is another Tsundere who uses a glass globe to use her powers and immediately hates Arata until he starts acting more heroic around her which makes her to start changing her mind.\\n\r\nFinally Akio is Mira's best friend and her powers mainly rely on her offensive capabilities like punching or kicking, she is a bit more smug than Mira and can be a bit of a joker at times.\\n\r\nMost of these females characters I didn't like mainly because they felt boring and just didn't get to me, the only ones I kinda liked were Lilith and Yui who were at least likeable in some way.\\n\r\nArata the main character of the series is surprisingly well done for a Harem protagonist mainly because despite being a big perv he isn't afraid be pervy around the girls and he has a very cocky, douchebag like attitude which actually made him a likeable character and then there is Sora who is the Grimoire that Arata acquires, she can be witty, but her character really doesn't go that far since you only see her in human form a few times.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle didn't really grab me apart from the powers which did look pretty cool when they were used, but other than there really wasn't much that stood out for me, well maybe there was few parts like when Arata had to travel to the dungeon that was holding Yui I thought that was pretty cool at least.\\n\\n\r\nHell even the fanservice or Ecchi was pretty disappointing, what is supposed to make your female characters gain some attention didn't really do much for me and just felt disappointing and out of place.\\n\r\nThe action wasn't too bad and the fights did get better over time, but it wasn't really enough to keep me very interested in the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a disappointing show and it was just another pure example of why most Harem anime' can be boring and repetitive, if you're interested in Harem's and fanservice you might find something here, but I wouldn't get your hopes up.",

Characters just suddenly lose their main characteristic that distinguishes them against the mc which I rated an 8.

The rest was the same old formula ... underdog trying to achieve his goal (to help someone dear to him), op powers, girls \"realizing\" that he is not so bad ... a lot of \"luck\" , some boobs, more boobs, boobs... and nothing surprising... no real twist. This could not invoke any kind of emotion (\"lol\" in real life isnt really an emotion....).It has funny parts, but nothing other thanthat is worth watching. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters, especially girls felt like most generic templates for harem anime girls.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, as I already wrote, was really unsurprising, i would even say boring, because it just follows the \"happy ending (season ending) with maybe some sacrificed but not really\" formula. And it is set in wague world with some (secret) magick. Of Course it has fucking magick circles ... and a lot of useless crap behind them.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you combine these characters and storry settings, only question you get answer to is: ,,Ho would different breasts sizes look in light of magick circles?\".

The deep remorse he feels since recall the tragedy and his strong desire to save his cousin brings the decision to be a mage after he unintentionally used grimoire then met a mage. His goal just for Hijiri makes him need to overcome many issues, such as to gather up The Trinity Seven\u20147 mages who are excel in their own fields.\r\n    As usual, I will start from the plot, visuals, and characters development. From these threeelements, I vote for the visuals eventho' I'm sorry to say that the graphic is not enough to be described as fantastic. It's good enough, nice battle the series has, and catchy magic circles lol When the school life enters the scene, there is not much to say. the graphic and artworks are proper. However sometimes from my point of view, this show miss the details except well-built architecture.\\n\\n\r\n    I wish to skip the plot review because it's nothing special, someone who wants to save his family member and need to be stronger and involved others as party. Well, I think that's a good wish. Briefly the story went pyon-pyon, it was like there were so many shortcuts they clicked to advance towards Arata's goal. Occasionally, we will find the explanation of how the magic works in a battle rather than the battle itself, it was quite bothering me and made me wonder why would the show makes the explanation in words instead of making us understand from the fight? Summary, too much talk, babbling just about the detail of strategy or power or magic itself. So messy it is.\\n\r\n    Then what upset me the most is characters development. They are developing physically, by training and experiences in battle. Lack of improvement emotionally/personality, which makes the character seems so stagnant (aside from the story). Trinity Sevens's love for Arata is increasing bit by bit, and the show ecchi-ness, too, is leveled up considerably. Ecchi-ness in every serious situation, not enough real fights, the story is hanging and chimerical. That's what I could note up to now.\\n\\n\r\n    The theme song for this series is much more than the usual. The OP song is only one, sung by ZAQ \"Seven Doors\". I like this one the melody has stomping rhythm. There are four different ED themes; \"BEAUTIFUL\u2252SENTENCE\" by Magus Two (Lilith Asami's seiyuu & Arin Kannazuki's seiyuu); \"SHaVaDaVa in AMAZING\u266a\" by Yui Levi\u2661 (Levi Kazama's seiyuu & Yui Kurata's seiyuu); \"ReSTART \"THE WORLD\"\" by TWINKle MAGIC [Lieselotte Sherlock's seiyuu & Serina Sherlock's seiyuu); \"TRINITY\u00d7SEVENTH\uff0bHEAVEN\" by Security Politti (Mira Yamana's seiyuu & Akio Fudou's seiyuu). These songs are sung by seiyuus of Trinity Seven, plus younger sister of Lieselotte Sherlock. These four are good, SHaVaDaVa in AMAZING\u266a has cloudless tempo, mostly filled with somewhat electronic music technology and instruments.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI appreciate various theme songs here. Alas, I give this show rate around 4.5 only.\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\nEcchiness is sealing the seriousness (ecchi scenes are too much, out of place)\\n\r\nPoor characters development\\n\r\nToo much babbling like trash talk",

However I gotta admit Trinity Seven wasn't as bad as I thought it might be. Trinity Seven certainly wasn't no revolutionary anime that'll change how people view harems, but at least it had some decent fights scenes to distract me from how repetitive the harem scenes could be.\r\nThe few fight scenes were one of the few interesting things about this anime, of course these fight scenes were nothing I haven't seen before but they were somewhat cool.For the most part they weren't overly ... \"Lewd\". Most of the time during the fight scenes it was focused mostly on action instead of trying to force some \"lewdness\" into the fight scenes, except a couple fight scenes did have quite a bit of \"lewdness\" in it... Especially the last few fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nAll the girl's we're just generic cute trash. And the main character (surprise, surprise, was a cocky son of a gun) However there is one thing I like about him, whenever he was making sexual jokes, they never tried to make him into this \"innocent child\" who just happens to get into the quirky issues, from the start of this anime they showed that he's not gonna be \"innocent\" and will certainly be fine with pulling a few strings to get some \"Fun\" time. In terms of characters that's about the only good / somewhat unique thing they had going for them.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I don't recommend watching Trinity Seven. At the very best it had decent fight scenes, However if you're looking for fight scene's i'd just recommend FMA or AOT or something focused on action... If you want a reason to watch this show, watch it for the Harem side. I'm not a fan of Harem's so I don't know too many \"good\" harems but I think this one did it's job pretty well and at least gave me a chuckle once or twice.",
