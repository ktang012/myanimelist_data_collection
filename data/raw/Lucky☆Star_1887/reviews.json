            "content": "Lucky star is one of those unique Comedy anime that comes very rarely. It manages to put a comedic twist to normal everyday occurances, and many pop culutre references. The entire show is not your typical slice of life high school comedy anime, rather its show structure follows more of a western style of comedy, a sitcom to be exact. Instead  of having a direct storyline, like  most anime viewers are used to, it focuses more of everyday observations and Jpop culture as their source of comedy.\r\n---Theres always a storyline no matter how broad it is. Many ppl say theres no story linebut, there has to be a &quot;story&quot; of sorts or else this stuff cant be funny. If you had to put a plot to this show it would &quot;A group of high school children trying to make it all the way through high school.&quot; With such a broad plot, the creators can do as they please. By the way, that is how most western sitcoms can list 5-10 seasons without it getting old (i.e. Simpsons, Family Guy, Cheers, etc.) Mind you thats the only connection this show has with a western sitcom. \\n\r\n---I have noticed many people bash the begging episodes of the show but i found them equally entertaining as the rest of them. It really depends on what the viewer does in their own daily lives is what truly makes this show funny. Somone who doesnt eat curry/rice or grilled meat sticks for dinner with their family wont understand a joke about it. But with all the jokes and references  in this show you're bound to laugh out loud at all they throw at you! They've thoguht of everything for this show. \\n\\n\r\n---Art and animation of the show is your typical comedy anime fair. Simple characters simple backgrounds simple static objects. But they manage to take &quot;simple&quot; to a whole different level. For example, the characters are only shown from the waist up for about 80% of the entire show. But the characters are drawn very simplistic and the coloring for each looks like it doesnt exeed 12 different colors for each person for the most part. But they are definitely drawn in a cute manner, if thats your thing. The simple-ness is what gives the show its charm too. The art style is so popular and easy to draw im sure you'll find spoofs for dozens of other non related characters around the internet. \\n\\n\r\n---The Sound is your standard comedy sound efects from light hearted piano songs, to bing bangs and bongs, they're all there and accounted for. Music is mostly absent from the show aside from helping out certain jokes.\\n\r\n---You will definitely notice the lack of background music in the show but with such a powerful seiyu cast, one could understand that they didnt want to distract from the well executed voice acting. Of course most people will notice Aya Hirano and maybe even Minori Chihara. Its hard to believe that most of the main characters are voiced by relatively newcomers. Which also helps seperate Lucky Star from sounding the same as all the other school anime out there. You'll enjoy Kagami's singing voice by the way. \\n\\n\r\nWith the uniqe sound comes the &quot;unique&quot; (or not so unique) character types associated with each seiyu.  Theres also ALOT more characters but you'll have to watch it to see them all ^_^  Speaking of characters you'll actually end up seeing all of them fairly regurlarly. Either supporting cast or main cast. By the end of the show, you'll get the feeling that not one person recieved more time than another. Even the extra characters get more than enough airtime to fully acknowledge them as essential parts of the anime. \\n\\n\r\n---The enjoyment factor is through the roof in my opinion. The comedy aspect of this show covers so many angles and hits so many things perfectly its hard not to give a perfect score. I find it very hard for somone to hate this anime. That is, if you dont like japanese pop cultre, anime references and funny common occurences. If youre that type then why are you watching anime? ^_^\\n\r\n---Also, if you dont like western style sitcoms where the end of every episode will always leave the same way they started, this is definitely not for you. If youre looking for a romantic comedy or bloody action school go somewhere else.  If you're willing to give up about 20 minutes of your time for pure entertainment, WATCH THIS SHOW!\\n\\n\r\nIf you find anything funnier pm me i'll give it a shot but for now this the funniest anime i've watched to date ^_^",

            "content": "\"This is so BORING!\" is what most of you will say if you watch it.\r\nI'll admit, that is what I thought at first, and I stopped watching on the first episode when they were talking about which side is the head of a \"chocolate cornet bread\"... But after a while, I gave it another try, and this time, I watched patiently and watched through the entire first episode. I was still not impressed, and still bored. I moved on to the next episode, and as you can tell by my over-all rating of a 10, I loved the rest. Now here is why:\r\nThe story, isnon-existent (as I will put no emphasis on story in this review). But that was one of the main reasons I loved it. There was no tension, no fighting, no drama, no heart-breaks. Just pure comedy. \\n\r\nComedy? Well, there's nothing that will make you roll over. But, there are countless moments where it makes you smile, many times even chuckles if you get the jokes. \\n\r\nThe comedy works in this anime by having the characters go through moments where you go like, \"OH I feel you!\", \"I totally know what you mean!, or \"Ah so glad I am not the only one who does that!\". That's why it's really funny in a way, making this the most accurate \"slice of life\" I have ever viewed. \\n\r\nThe English dub for this anime is pretty amazing (for once), the voice actor for Konata, the main character, does a wonderful job of bring her to life. The characters are all likable, but Konata is one of the best characters I have seen, and she manages to do all that without geass powers or sword skills, too. I don't want to spoil anything, so I will leave it up to you to find out more about why I find Konata so great.\\n\r\nAlso, it's a huge plus if you are exposed to Japanese culture (real life), because many of the jokes is about the daily life there and you will only get the jokes if you have experienced it (there aren't that many, so don't worry).\\n\r\nTo sum it up, Lucky Star is about the daily life of the girls, there won't be any conflicts like there are in many slice of life anime, this anime is very peaceful, and you can relate to many of the characters.\\n\r\nGive it a try! Watch a few clips of it! Type in \"Funny Lucky Star Moments\" on Youtube and see for yourself! If you like it, WATCH IT. Don't marathon it, in fact, watch an episode after a long day, or better yet, watch it to calm your nerves after something like Code Geass/Death Note. Thank you",

            "content": "There is nothing in entertainment worse than bad comedy.\r\nBad drama, horror, romance, or action at least has the possibility of being amusing, if only for purely ironical purposes, and watching something which is intended to be serious completely fail can be surprisingly fun (see MST3K). However, watching something try to be funny and fail is hardly ever amusing in the slightest, and amounts, for me at least, to the epitome of nauseating boredom. In the anime world, Lucky Star is perhaps the best (and at the very least the most popular) example of bad comedy ever made.\r\nNow, it is more or less universally agreed uponamongst Lucky Star's detractors that the show is, quite simply, \"unfunny.\" At the same time however, it is not always explained in detail why or how it is unfunny. But before delving into the specifics, I will freely admit from the outset that comedy is probably the most subjective and difficult of all genres (I myself have some bizarre comedic tastes) to review. Nevertheless, I believe Lucky Star merits special attention, along with a special place in Hell, for how unprecedentedly unfunny it is. This is also why I chose it for my inaugural anime review.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the \"humor\" of Lucky Star is derived from two sources: 1) Discussions about everyday life experience (e.g. food, homework, clothes), and 2) References (either verbal or visual) to other anime franchises and various anime-related tropes. As for the first, Lucky Star makes the awful mistake of assuming that simply because something is true or commonly experienced, it is funny. Thus the episodes are crammed with inane, excruciatingly detailed conversational gems like\\n\\n\r\nPerson 1: \"You know how when it's cold outside, you want to stay inside for longer?\"\\n\r\nPerson 2: \"Haha yeah, I've totally been there!\"\\n\\n\r\nor\\n\\n\r\nPerson 1: \"You know how when you have a lot of stuff to do, you clean your room instead?\"\\n\r\nPerson 2: \"Haha yeah, I've done that before!\"\\n\\n\r\nYou get the idea. The whole \"funny because it's true\" thing in my experience only works if it is comingled with an adequate amount of absurdity or exaggeration (for an example, see Mike Judge's films). Lucky Star, on the other hand, aims for pure realism in all its dullness. With this \"comedic\" logic, they may as well assume that simply because I have eaten food before, I will think that watching people eat food is funny; furthermore, I will think that people talking about eating food is also funny. What makes this method even more ridiculous for Lucky Star is the fact that one must be rather extensively versed in Japanese culture to even \"get\" a lot of these \"jokes,\" let alone find them funny.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the anime references, this is where the annoyance factor truly rears its ugly head. Typically, an outside reference to another anime is funny because it is unexpected and well-timed. Lucky Star on the other hand, crams in as many references as it possibly can, many of which are to other works from Kyoto Animation. As one might imagine, this not only gets incredibly dull, but also unbearably irritating as the show progresses. By far the most frequent and most facepalm-inducing are the references to the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Granted, this trick was somewhat amusing the first time, but by the end of the series, the Haruhi references become so frequent, so bland, and so obvious that I literally began slamming my head into my desk. Thus like the reference to \"everyday life,\" the references to anime make the assumption that just because we have seen the shows referenced, that we will find the references funny. Are we really supposed to pat ourselves on the back and quietly snicker to ourselves for being \"in the know\"? It seems like the real reason for all these anime references is a) a clever form of product-placement and b) riding on the success of vastly superior franchises (Full Metal Panic, Haruhi Suzumiya, the Key-game shows). The only reference that actually made me chuckle a bit (and not immediately roll my eyes or want to punch my computer screen) was the part in episode 13 where one of the shop employees uses his \"Geass\" on Konata to get her to buy a DVD, only to find that she is three yen short.\\n\\n\r\nNow typically, in order to use reference-parodies like this successfully, one ought to find a way to integrate them in a creative and subtle way, and there are many examples of this in anime alone. Lucky Star, on the other hand, particularly when parodying well-known anime tropes, squanders its comedic potential by feeling the need to tell you exactly what they are parodying. Therefore, whenever Miyuki trips or turns off the light by accident, or Yutaka mentions that she is frail and \"sick all the time,\" we are sure to have Konata not far off to immediately comment how incredibly \"moe\" she is. Ha. Ha. Ha. There is a similar delivery style with \"tsundere,\" \"fanservice,\" and other related terms and cliches. Watching this is like listening to someone tell a joke only to quickly explain the punchline before the audience even has a chance to laugh.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetically, there is not terribly much to say other than I find it amazing that even here Lucky Star manages to add yet another layer of annoyance. The characters were clearly designed to resemble the (equally unfunny) manga as closely as possible, and the result is not pleasing. The foreground and background art is lackluster and totally generic, not to mention the core girls all look waaaay too young (and not just in a typical \"moe\" way) for being in high school. Such failure in this department is all the more surprising knowing that this show was produced by Kyoto Animation, a studio which, among other things, is particularly well known for its beautiful and groundbreaking visual styling. In Lucky Star, there is no such evidence whatsoever that this is the same company who did Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid, Air, or Kanon. I suspect the real reason Kyoto took this project on was because of potential legal issues surrounding the ludicrous amounts of references to their other works. Other than that, the music consists of bland, forgettable five-note pieces typical for this kind of show. Except worse.\\n\\n\r\nSetting aside for a moment what Lucky Star has brings up the important issue of what it does not have. In fact, one of Lucky Star's most subtle and yet most serious detriments is the almost complete absence of visual humor of any kind (the stock anime-facial-expressions aside). The show is quite simply a bunch of talking heads, and as something in the medium of animation, Lucky Star feels incredibly out of place; 99% of the show consist of dialogue and dialogue only. Suffice it to say, this show was a complete and unfortunate waste of Kyoto's talent.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, my biggest problem with Lucky Star, and the reason why I have been compelled to write this review, is that it basically gives slice of life comedy a bad name--something which is all the more compounded by its rabid popularity. It is not at all unlikely that someone who has never seen a slice of life show will first see Lucky Star and then assume that the entire genre is of similar quality. After all, comments like \"nothing happens\" and \"there's no plot\" are fairly common amongst complaints from Lucky Star haters. Unfortunately, I believe people may be missing out on a lot of great, funny, clever slice of life shows \"where there's no plot\" (Fumoffu, Azumanga Daioh, Minami-ke) if Lucky Star does indeed manage to taint them so severely. It is interesting to note that Lucky Star is perhaps most often mentioned along with the classic Azumanga Daioh, and the comparison is not at all unmerited: both shows are based off of a four-panel manga about a group of quirky high school girls and their antics. However, once the stylistic similarities are brushed aside, you are left with two anime which could not be more diametrically opposed. That is, whereas Azumanga Daioh represents the pinnacle of comedy done right, Lucky Star represent the pinnacle of comedy done wrong; whereas Azumanga Daioh uses \"random conversations about food\" in a broader, situational context to give them humorous contrast, Lucky Star takes this device to a ridiculous extreme--it makes an entire show out of it to the expense of nearly everything else. The difference between Azumanga's Osaka and Lucky Star's Konata is that the former is one character amongst many, whereas the latter is only an otaku-pandering, watered-down Osaka amongst many other watered-down Osaka's, without any significant personality contrast. In Lucky Star, there is no one to sarcastically say \"wow, you have a really vivid imagination...\" but rather the one-note \"joke\" of \"randomness\" continues on into senseless oblivion. If Azumanga Daioh is a bright beacon of joyful, energetic laughter, Lucky Star is a dark pit of disparaging, cynical boredom (if you'll excuse the melodramatic language). It basically takes the slice of life genre but does not fill it with any real content, leaving naught but an empty husk.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you want a creative, genuine, funny slice-of-life comedy and not simply a long otaku in-joke set on repeat, avoid Lucky Star like the plague.",

            "content": "When I first looked into Lucky Star, I thought I was going to be impressed. People in the anime club I help run wanted to watch this series so bad and it ended up in 4th place, so we weren't able to show it this semester. Still, I wanted to know what the appeal of Lucky Star was. The chibi art made the anime look unique and interesting, and I thought that I couldn't go wrong with an anime series that was so popular. This is where \"looks can be deceiving\" really comes into play.\r\nDespite the cute art, which got annoying very quickly, Lucky Starreally fell on its face form the get-go. The story had nothing to offer. Basically, you spend twenty-four episodes watching a group of high school girls run around, talk to each other, make jokes, and dance. I have completely summarized the entire series for you in that last sentence, and I'm not kidding. Each episode was a repeat as the last, except for character problems and issues, and after every episode I said, \"Alright, it still has to get better from here,\" and it never did. The only thing that ever improved was the Lucky Channel, but that was because I didn't have to hear Akira's annoying squeaking in the last three or so episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI know that the story is suppose to be based around a comedic high school cast, but to be honest, the comedy was terrible. In order to get most of the jokes, one would have to know a lot in video games, anime, and Japanese puns. Now, I don't know a lot of video games or Japanese puns, so those jokes failed, and the anime jokes that I did get surfaced once in a while, and that type of comedy was absolutely terrible. I think I snickered maybe once or twice during the entire series. Yes, the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with Lucky Star's terrible story and comedy choice, I found myself hating most of the characters. The only half-way decent characters were shown in the last half of the anime, and those characters really weren't anything special. Most of the weren't dynamic, lacking originality, and went along with the same thing over and over again. When those sparks of originality were shown, they were quickly covered by the same old, bland things that happened through out the entire series. A great example comes from Konata, the main girl with blue hair and green eyes. She runs around every episode, talks about food, anime, video games, and how she was late or tired because she stayed up all night playing video games. Kagami, one of the lavender haired twins, is exactly the same way - smart, angered easily, and is very poor at house chores. Miyuki, the pink haired girl with glasses, is klutsy, \"moe\", intelligent, and formal with her speech. I could go on and on, but I don't think it's needed.\\n\\n\r\nWith the characters, art, and story quickly falling apart, I turned to something I thought would work - the music. I learned quickly, however, that the music was only a little better than everything else. Some of the songs sounded like they were recorded on a cellphone and then placed into the show. It wasn't that the quality was bad, but rather than the music used was very bland, unoriginal, and lacked dynamic, not that the story had any of those or anything. The music fit the series alright, but by itself, the music would just be a waste of space on whatever drive you would be listening to it on. Even the opening theme was annoying.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with all of these things said, I'm surprised that I made it to the last episode. Now, it's safe to say that just because I didn't enjoy it doesn't mean that others won't. Obviously, the MAL rating for Lucky Star fights any point that I've made against the series. However, I will not be recommending Lucky Star to any of my friends. Ever. In fact, I will tell them to avoid it, and to be fair in my fight, I don't think it deserves the popularity it has. Sure it's cute, but that's about it.",

            "content": "In the year 2007 A.D., a fire was brewing in the Kyoto Animation studio. Fresh off the success of Haruhi Suzumiya and smelling of farts and ramen-scented body odor, the staff of KyoAni developed an ingenious plan to further milk countless wads of cashmoney from pathetic losers and pedophiles on both sides of the pacific: take a popular 4 panel comic series ripe with the elements that made Suzumiya a financial success (pandering to shut in weeaboos with lolicon action figure collections and terabytes of hentai) and turn it into an equally horrendous anime series. After spending tireless hours handcrafting only the stalest jokes, theblandest artwork, and the most mindnumbingly boring scripts in Japanese television history, Yushiro Takemoto opened his anus and took a massive shit onto a nearby Tokyo sidewalk. Millions gawked at the magnitude of his feces: proportions this great hadn't been seen since U2 released the waterboarding-like torturefest that was \"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\" in 2004. Once Norwegian scientists had been given proper time to mass, perform tests on, and take pictures with said shit, Takemoto was told he needed to give it a name. He chose Lucky Star.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like those gag electric shock pens you gave out to your friends as a prank in the 4th grade, Lucky Star tricks you into watching it under the guise that it's a \"comedy\", but in reality it's less of a laugh-fest and more of an exercise in sadomasochism. Half-way through the first episode I was convinced that having to watch this must be the wrath of a vengeful God, intent on punishing me for my past missteps and failures. By episode 2 I had been reduced to a vegetable, as the show had literally sucked all the energy from me. By episode 9 this condition became chronic, as I had turned my once-lovely living room into a wasteland and my once clean underwear into a net for catching the diarrhea that seeped from my petrified asshole. By episode 16 I had gathered enough energy to attempt suicide. After a short recovery stint in the hospital, I was put on anti-depressants and bear tranquilizers, and sooner or later I told my therapist that I needed to conquer my demons once and for all and finish this series. He approved, but only on one condition: that I watch it with him present in the room. I tried to talk sense into him, but he insisted that \"he's seen a lot of things in his time, alot of them a lot worse than anything a Japanese cartoon could throw at him.\"\\n\\n\r\nHe later shot himself in a Staples parking lot.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it plainly, Lucky Star is the antithesis of entertainment. There is nothing funny, clever, witty, or remotely interesting about the show. Weeaboo faggots will desperately try to convince you that this series is a comedic masterpiece and a pinnacle of artistic achievement, but as the first five minutes clearly establish, this couldn't be farther from the truth. Lucky Star is only revolutionary in how much it's able to bore anyone that isn't a drooling fuckstick with social anxiety disorder---you will truly think that this anime transcended time and space to deliver you a universe-shattering kick in the nuts, unless you find Meet The Spartans type reference jokes funny and obviously pre-pubescent anime girls hot, in which case you will love this show like the fucking loser you are. Many have compared this show to Seinfeld because the two share a \"show-about-nothing\" approach to narrative storytelling, but this is where all logical comparisons end. Seinfeld is a groundbreaking TV series about the hilarious exploits of a group of really big assholes in New York. Lucky Star is a show about the various non-incidents in the lives of a bunch of \"this-is-what-weeaboos-wish-girls-were-like\" high schoolers that have dull-as-fuck conversations, fit neatly inside cliche archetypes without ever evolving, and make a lot of cringe-worthy pop culture references.\\n\\n\r\nBut pure shittiness alone is not enough to propel this anime to the bottom-of-the-barrel status it's currently at. What really gets me about Lucky Star is just how much the \"FEED ME MORE MONEY\" attitude of Kyoto Animation leaks into the actual production. Every time I endure a painfully boring discussion about some every-day life topic, another unfunny Lucky Channel skit, the explanation and, in turn, ruination of what otherwise would've been a passable joke, or some reference to Haruhi/[insert video game and/or anime here] it brings me back to the actual intended purpose of this series. The characters, situations, and jokes are all purposely written to be engaging to shut-in dorks who spend most of their lives watching anime, playing video games, and posting on internet message boards. It's the hollowest anime I've ever watched; it soullessly and maliciously appeals to people who are too pathetic to realize that they're being pandered to for cash---if you paid money to see any part of this show and AREN'T one of these people, you will walk away from the experience feeling like someone shot you in the knees and proceeded to steal your house, car, identity, and wife. It's an anime designed to be watched amongst anime club meetings filled with people who force out dry heaves of laughter so they can feel like they fit in with everyone around them, and on projector screens at anime conventions filled with freaks dressed up as animals and Sailor Moon characters. This show was not created out of passion, or a general love for the medium, or an actual belief that the show would be funny, it was created to exploit the lowest common denominator of anime fans for a quick buck. It's taking money from people who don't know any better, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and takes away any respect you might've had for anyone involved in making the series.\\n\\n\r\nLucky Star's art is sickeningly sweet moe-trash. For a studio that is clearly focused more on animation than story, the level of mediocrity shown here is unacceptable. At least when I watched that shitheap Haruhi Suzumiya I could compliment aspects where it was clear that an effort was made to produce a quality product---here, we have a prime example of the new-age, assembly style artwork that is plaguing modern anime. With our huge advantages in technology, one would think that the seemingly limitless possibilities would spark breathtaking results, and while we have seen glimpses of that (i.e. 2009's Summer Wars), most of what has prevailed in the industry has been streamlined, sterilized, and soulless.\\n\\n\r\nI do have to give the anime props in the sound department, however. The OP is probably the most engaging part of the entire show, as each time you hear it you will be pumped for what has to be the episode where the series starts to pick up. Although it never does, I can't fault the OP for giving us hope. The various EDs run the gauntlet in terms of quality, but overall they're a nice break away from the mouth breathing dynamics that are the actual show. As for the voice actors, they all came and turned out respectable performances, giving the show at least one bearable quality in between credits. This is one of the few anime that I watched subbed however, so I have no idea if the American VAs are any good.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that people say they can relate to characters on this show is frightening. They literally amount to little moeballs stuffed with every possible high-school girl cliche the writers could dig up, and never develop past that point. Konata, however, is not only that, but something much, much worse. While the rest of the characters seek to appeal to the section of the anime market that fawns over overt cuteness, Konata is an interesting look at how far an animation studio will go to squeeze money out of otaku fucks. She was created solely so weeaboos would have someone on the cast they could identify with, and keeping in tune with Kyoto Animation's opinion of their viewers, she's painfully one-dimensional. Her hobbies include video games, anime, and being a bitch. That's it. Unfortunately, not much else can be said about the rest of their characters either. Miyuki is the intellect of the group, but she's also moe. Tsukasa is the shy one, but she's also moe. Kagami is the fiery tsundere, but she's also moe. At the very least, when you give a one line description of Seinfeld's characters, you're leaving out a lot of character information. They may not really change as time progresses, but you certainly learn a lot more about them. In Lucky Star, one line descriptions define our characters for the entire show. There's more character development on an episode of Cops than there is here.\\n\\n\r\nAs I reached the end of the final episode, I turned to my therapist who was, at that current moment, sobbing into my shoulder due to sheer, unfettered boredom. His bloodshot eyes looked up at me and as I looked down at him with a mix of pity and remorse, I could see his lips faintly whisper out \"save me\". As the girls geared up their cheerleading performance of the opening song, I could see his last glimmer of hope, of faith in humanity, slip away from him and float towards the abyss.\\n\\n\r\nHe thought he could save me.\\n\\n\r\nI refuse to believe that Kyoto Animation could, as they watched over the series for the last time before officially releasing it, say with complete honesty that this series was not only acceptable for public consumption but also legitimately enjoyable. It's possible to relish in a show's badness if you're able to respect the sincerity of the people that made it. It's why I love movies like The Room and Batman and Robin, and it's why I think Mars of Destruction deserves to be shown nightly on HBO. However, when something this bad is actually just a cruel joke at the expense of a bunch of weeaboo faggots, the insincerity of it all taints what could've just been a run of the mill bad show and turns it into something mean-spirited and unlikeable. I don't think otaku realize that this show isn't actually celebrating the things they love, it's passive-aggressively making fun of them and their interests, and they're actually paying to have it happen to them in real time. Has this community sunk so low that even the people making this shit can get away with calling you all fucking losers? At what point will you stop yelling \"FEED ME MORE MOE GIRLS\" and start clamoring for real, quality entertainment? Don't you want to know what it feels like to laugh without having to force it out?\\n\\n\r\nWhat's that? K-ON!!'s on? Sorry, I'll come back when you're finished.",

A more appropriate and less obscure name would be \"Killing yourself with boredom\".\r\nJust want a moment to say this. OVERRATED. You could watch the first few minutes of Lucky Star or you could repeatedly hit yourself on the head with a brick. The effect is surprisingly similar.\r\nI wasnt sure on what to do with this anime. Was it supposed to be funny? How? I cant find one thing about it funny! Am I supposed to enjoy how Im able to relate to them? \"Hey dude,that fictional, animated girl on the T.V just farted, so did I!&quot; Well I'll be damn.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is just screaming out the word boredom. Who on earth would want to watch schoolgirls talk about the different ways to cut food for five friggin minutes? Surprisingly, millions of em. Even after contemplating for a long period of time, I can not fathom why anyone would want to watch this. To be honest, I dont go for slice of life anime's but I am assured that this is an insult to slice of life anime's everywhere. We deserve better than this piece of ****.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and the voice acting is the only saving grace here. The rest are piss. The characters are shallow, comedy is not comedic, and lets not forget about how blunt the story is.\\n\\n\r\nSchool Rumble has nothing to fear from this destitute, brain-numbing show.\\n\r\nIf I were you I would rather take a brick, apply it to my forehead with force: Trust me, it&rsquo;ll hurt less than trying to make sense of this anime.",

            "content": "Erm...So i have now re-watched it for second time...This is my first time doing something like that. Raki \u2606 Suta! \r\nStory: Most common mistake people make is that they say Lucky Star doesn't have a story. It has! \"The daily lives of 4 high school girls.\" Understood? Good. Can't say much here, because of the randomness of \"slice of life\" genre. Still, I like how the story progress, except for the first few episodes which people usually don't understand what the series is about - which is director's fault. *shrugs* He got fired after the first four episodes anyway. If you think this story isbad, wait 'till you see Mars of Destruction.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: Yeah, I know that the art is nothing compared to KyoAni's usual productions, but is far better than them in one aspect, cuteness. Anyone who have watched the series can tell that how cute Konata is. Most of the scenes aren't really detailed, you usually see the upper parts of the characters, but that doesn't change how well cuteness goes with Miyuki's 'ultimade moe-ness', Konata's children-like personality and Tsukasa's 'little sister-ish' figure. BTW, background is detailed, proof (was) here, now destroyed with the absence of BBCodes.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: This one varies a lot, depending on how many animes you've seen. The OP is catchy, and goes with the cuteness of the anime. The different endings were a good addition to anime, but if you haven't heard the songs before, you may think that a single ending theme would be better. And for the second part of the EDs, Shiraishi Minoru does awesome job. You still may not know some of the songs sung by him, but just watching him is entertaining too. I love how KyoAni toys with their own songs. The sound effects and OST isn't really obvious, but I can say that how it goes with the flow and is \"cute\" really enhances the dialogues. Especially when Kona-chan is about to start saying a funny comment about Kagami, the way music stops right before it and you can guess it coming.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Probably you can't learn their personalities in just one episode, but as the time goes on, you learn more and more about their personality. Even in the second half of the anime where they introduce new characters, no character gets more screentime than another. If they do, well, KyoAni is sure to make a joke about them! They are so unique and easy to remember. OK, not really unique (Kagami as you typical tsundere and Miyuki as you typical moe) but they are unique in their own ways. No wait! According to Shiraishi, Kagami isn't tsundere! Oh well, I don't care about what he thinks. Kagami is tsundere. \\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: What can someone give this part anything besides 10 out of 10? Great jokes, mainly based Suzumiya Haruhi and everyday problems of the world and Japan. Again, if you haven't watched Haruhi yet, you won't be able to get even the half of the jokes. That said, if you have watched it, you'll probably love the jokes. Azumanga Daioh is pretty much the same as Lucky Star, both having jokes based on pure randomness. School Rumble is more romance oriented, but still on par with them. If I had to pick one of them, it'd definitely be Lucky Star.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This series is a definitely a must-see for someone who has some anime knowledge and interested in slice of life/comedy genre. Lucky Star is a win or lose situation. Either you hate it, or you love it. If you like it, it will probably certainly be one of your favourite animes. If you don't like the slice of life/comedy genre and don't have fun finding all those references, I suggest that you don't watch it. Be sure to watch Haruhi beforehand, if you are going to watch Lucky Star.\\n\r\n10/10",

            "content": "I may be considered as a Lucky Star hater. The previous sentence is for people who click the \"Not Helpful\" button just because they disagree with the review instead of how well constructed the review is; I do not wish to waste their precious time as inhumane and insensitive beings to destroy other people's lives as reviewers. Even if I do talk about the good aspects of the work that I enjoyed, I expect about 10 of 1,500 people to find this review helpful so Lucky Star fans, make me proud. To everyone else considering this show and reading reviews because of how well-constructed theyare, I implore you to continue reading.\\n\\n\r\nI am a big fan of slice-of-life shows. It is a genre that plays with the mundaneness of life and family; there is very little concrete story and shows tend to be driven either by comedy, moe, or relationship dynamics. Lucky Star is not a slice-of-life show, but a show that panders to otakus with a considerable amount of fanservice and random anime references that makes Family Guy cry in his bed and call for mommy. I do not wish to call such works terrible just because they do that; Pani Poni Dash does this as well and it's way funner to watch even if you don't get all the references because it feels like a sitcom. Lucky Star is not a sitcom.\\n\\n\r\nThe show itself is inconsistent. Episode 1 is infamous because it is plain boring. In the Studio Shaft anime, Sayonara, Zetsubou Sensei, the characters criticized episode 1's coronet scene for just being plain boring. Episode 1 is almost unwatchable. It makes FLCL's quotable line, \"Nothing amazing happens here. Everything is ordinary.\", feel so true with the anime medium. People who plan to watch this show should note the actual work only starts at about episode 2.\\n\\n\r\nOther episodes involve the \"cute girls doing cute things\" mantra. I'm pretty cool with this -- as I said, I'm a big fan of slice-of-life works --; however, the main character cast is almost a letdown from the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nKonata, played by Aya Hirano, references to Haruhi and other famous shows from the past. If you know Hokuto no Ken/Fist of the North Star and Initial D, then you are in luck. Most people don't; however, this show can still be watched without knowing the references. It's just that you'll be missing 80% of the show's \"appeal\", unlike Pani Poni Dash's which only amounts about 40%.\\n\\n\r\nKagami is a tsundere who plays the straight man role. Tsukasa is moe and clumsy. Miyuki is moe and smart because she has glasses. If we judge them by character models, I think they're all pretty cute. As characters, they are terrible, bland, and boring. They don't offer a lot of interesting dynamics and they just feel flat as characters. Miyuki is one of the worst flat characters, changing very little throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nOther episodes fared better with the addition of supporting characters. I enjoyed the supporting characters more than the main cast. Konata's dad, Izumi, is a perverted man who enjoys taking pictures of little girls and often asks his daughter to find the flag to get into the h-scene in eroges. Anime Tenchou is one of the most memorable characters and his over-the-top antics leave something to desire in the show itself. Akira Kogami's and Minoru Shiraishi's dynamics are just fun to look at; I look forward to their Lucky Channel segment a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThere is an episode that I remember being actually good. It's about Konata's mother. To me, that's actually pretty good slice-of-life drama. Why the show doesn't follow this formula of success and go into moe pandering confuses me.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I am negative about the characters, the modeling as I said are great. The puni plush style is gorgeous and the backgrounds, as expected from KyoAni, are beautiful and photorealistic. If I view this as an art piece, it might get a B+ from me.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is one of those catchy atrocious tunes; the lyrics make little sense at all. Animation in the OP is pretty dynamic and wacky, unlike the show itself. I'm more of a \"meh\" when it comes to the OP.\\n\\n\r\nTo call the show polarizing is an understatement; it's either a show that you love or hate. I am clearly at the \"hate\" part, but I see some good aspects of the work. However, there are too many problems that causes me to dislike and hate the work. I admit that this work is influential, but for the wrong reasons. People should not just watch for the work's influence, but whether they enjoyed it or not. That's how you rate and review a work.",

I watched the first episode today (6th of July), but I have to say that it's maybe the most annoying, boring and useless anime my poor eyes have ever seen. This anime is simply horrid.\r\nIt made me sick after 5 minutes (opening theme included), and I've dropped it at the first episode. It actually never happened to me before. I guess there's a first time for everything.\r\nThe OP, its lyrics, the characters, the dialogues, everything is just too stupid to bear. Even a decent (if youdare to call a moeblob thing decent) art is completely useless with an anime like Lucky Star.\\n\\n\r\nAfter only 1 episode, I felt like some of my precious neurons died, so I've stopped quickly.\\n\r\nA whole episode talking about how to eat food (more specifically, a chocolate cornet)? Now if you excuse me...\\n\r\n1) I already know how to eat, since I'm not retarded like Konata.\\n\r\n2) I have many better things to do.\\n\r\n3) I prefer sushi.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no character development. At all.\\n\r\nThe whole episode is absurdly boring.\\n\r\nMore than slice of life, it's a slice of cake.\\n\r\nAnd, the worst thing is, it's supposed to be a comedy, and it's not funny. Not in the slightest bit.\\n\r\nIs Lucky Star supposed to make you cry from laughing? Yes, you'll cry, but only due to extreme boredom from watching this pathetic anime.\\n\\n\r\nEverything would be better than watch stupid 17yo girls (who look like 8yo to please the lolicon audience) that do nothing except talking, and talking, and talking in an awfully annoying and inconclusive way about the most superficial topics ever heard. I've had way more fun with watching my cat sleeping.\\n\\n\r\nLucky Star is the umpteenth anime that proves how the masses are blind towards the quality of an anime and how they always follow the cute (?), frivolous, random fashion that is currently on the top of the list.\\n\r\nAn advice for you guys: go watch a REAL anime. Don't waste your precious time with this retarded moeblob KyoAni parade. Want an actual funny anime? Watch Excel Saga. Watch Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. Watch Shin-chan. Watch everything but Lucky Star.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, I know everyone's going to hate my review and hope I'll burn in hell for writing this about the best anime ever made (...yes...sure...).",

The pain, I couldn't stand it. Nevertheless, I tried to watch it and see if I could find something interesting but sadly I couldn't\r\nStory: Pretty poor indeed, because there isn't a plot. The anime only talks about the life of 4 high school girls... 5 later. There isn't anything else, otherthan talking about their usual lifes, food, animes, videogames, etc. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was fine, I really liked the colors and how beautiful it looked but sometimes the art was bad in other parts. All I can say is that sometimes it looked great and sometimes it looked bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The seiyuus were great, especially Konata and Kagami but sometimes some voices ruined the mood like almost all the sales clerk that appeared because almost all of them had the same seiyuu and that ruined it. The opening to be honest was pretty bad; the music was kind of bad and the endings... the only one I liked was when Konata sang Chala Head Chala but the other ones were bad, especially when they started to put real actors in the ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Hardly, there isn't a development there. The only thing that can be rescued is the fact of the interaction between Konata and Kagami but after all everything is dull. Let's put it this way; Konata is your typical otaku, Kagami the tsundere, Tsukasa the shy girl and Miyuki the one that is the intelligent. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, pretty bad. The anime is supposed to make you laugh or relate yourself to one of the character; I couldn't do that. The jokes and things that happen didn't amuse me at all and the characters the only one I could relate a little was Konata because she like me loves videogames and animes but that is all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This anime isn't for anyone. If you like anime with plot and character development then get away from here, you will never like Lucky Star. The anime itself isn't bad but as I said, it isn't for everyone. Some people might like it and enjoy the characters and the jokes that I couldn't get but for me, this anime is quite overrated; not even all the references of Haruhi could save it.",

            "content": "What happens when you combine my favorite genre (Slice of Life) with my favorite studio (Kyoto Animation)? You get Lucky Star.\r\nStory: Normally when I score story in a Slice of Life show, I do it based on all the episodic stories combined. But what happens when a show does not have that and is just pure life and is random with no coherent order/story. That is why I left the score a blank. \r\nBut I would still like to talk about the content. Lucky Star plays off its humor through normal everyday conversations. Talking about the most random things and finding humor out of itis tricky. Personally, I found most conversations hilarious because I enjoy the idea of everyday situations being made fun at. This type of humor is not for everybody and thus why this show can be a hit or miss.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect of this show is its use of references. A good amount of conversations play off such references. And they can go anywhere from other anime to current events. It went as far as to use an old commercial. One of the keys to be able to enjoy this anime is to be able to know the references. Watching as much anime as I do, I got most of them easily.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: Technically speaking, this is not KyoAni's best work. But the style and design works really well for this type of story. There are times where I felt that they were being very lazy and yet there were times I was marveled at the level of detail. Of course it is nowhere near the level of their other works such as Haruhi.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Voice - Everyone plays there roles really well. I was  particularly impressed with Hirano Aya (voice of Konata). KyoAni really utilized her vocal range and made great situations out of it. \\n\\n\r\n            Music - To me, this is probably the weakest aspect of the show. The OP is indeed catchy but it can only be appealing for so long. And the &quot;different&quot; ED each week was a hit or miss. The only great part about it was the appearance of Minoru Shiraishi. Having him sing for the last part of the series was brilliant. Listening to him was a blast. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Perhaps the strongest aspect of the show. The cast of Lucky Star are great. The variety it has and the way they fit so well together really bring out the show. Whether you come to like this show or not, I believe there will be at least one character that you can't help but like. Rather than me telling you, I hope you go check out this show after reading this review and see for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment = My score on MAL (it is subjectively rated)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a very enjoyable show. But it is for those who are into those kinds of humor. It is not something I would recommend to everybody. I believe this show is one of those shows where it is a hit or miss.",

            "content": "Overrated is the word that best describes Lucky Star. The animation is terrible for 2007 and the story is slice of life to the extreme; in other words boring. It's either a love it or hate it anime, but how can one like such a stale story line? \r\nThe animation/art is very lazy and the lines are jagged. Kyoto Animation has up to date animation but \"Lucky Star\" looked like there wasn't effort put in. The people in the background are usually grey keyholes, and sometimes have faces but aren't animated. The characters are, yes, in high school despite looking like they are eight. Thepalette is extremely pastel while the colours almost blend together. The only time the animation was astounding was in snippets of video games/manga/anime etc.. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are cliche and aren't developed. There's the perfectionist who gets high marks and is very Type A. There is the shy, clumsy girl who likes to cook. There is the glasses girl who is well mannered. And, the lazy girl who plays video games doesn't put effort into homework but gets above average marks. Stereotypical characters. The design on three of them are cute, but if one is looking for cute characters in anime he or she should watch anything by CLAMP (Card Captor Sakura, Chobits) or the queen of kawaii, Koge Donbo. (Di Gi Charat, Pita Ten) There needs to be substance to cute characters and CLAMP and Koge Donbo proves it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, as mentioned before, is very plotless. Napolean Dynamite may have proven stories without a plot can be entertaining, but Lucky Star doesn't prove that theory. The first episode the characters are taking about how to eat food. First episodes usually aren't the greatest in the series, but when the writers start off with a boring story one can get a clear picture of how the lack of plot is present in this anime. Also, first episodes are meant to encourage viewers to keep watching not bore them. Usually scenes to shows are no more than two minutes to keep things moving, but &quot;Lucky Star&quot; is at a snail's pace. It's episodic (each episode is different and not chronologically) which suited the show and added to Anime since most is thematic. (Each episode is connected) and  There are some jokes thrown in here and there as well as cameos to other anime/video games, but it doesn't save the storyline. \\n\\n\r\nThe random dancing in the opening is the only thing good about this anime.  If the show were to be animated well the random dance would have been more enjoyable. The opening music killed the amusing random dancing. It sounded more like owl's hooting a rap but inhaled too much helium. Though, there is a middle part (the only real singing) that is interesting. \\n\\n\r\nThe actors suited their roles and fit their personalities. They even hired the same actress who did Haruhi in The Melconcholy of Haruhi Suzumiya as one of the characters, which fit the Haruhi cameo. They had high pitched cartoony voices for the appropriate roles which suited the show. \\n\\n\r\nYou must count your lucky stars while watching this anime in order to enjoy this anime.  It's slice of life to the point where it's boring and leads nowhere. Watch the second episode (as mentioned the first is a disaster) to see if it amusing, which it isn&rsquo;t. Lucky Star doesn't offer anything to the table and can be easily passed to save one minutes of being wasted watching this anime. It may have gotten better but who wants to waste 10 episodes to get to the good stuff?\\n\\n",

            "content": "I found this anime very difficult to get through. The comedy wasnt exactly funny, and the jokes and puns were more like \r\n\"oh, i relate/understand that, is my life also considered sad?\"\r\nusing the rating breakdown, let me explain to you why I didnt find this anime particularly wonderful.\r\nSTORY: there was almost no storyline. Sure 4 girls are trying to get through high school. but that sums up every other anime out there, about kids at school. What this anime lacked was drive. Plot is one of the elements which create the drive, but there was none. Im giving the story a 5 just for thesake of the somewhat cleverly placed jokes. As well, many of the elements got tiring and old, such as Lucky Channel, which is a talkshow hosted at the end of each episode. The live action scenes at the end of the latter episodes also got extremely annoying and exploited.\\n\\n\r\nART: nothing spectacular. I understand that for this kind of show, beautiful art isnt exactly the most neccessary thing. However, a lot of the time, there was no background. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: sadly, there was hardly any background music. But the sole reason that I rated the sound so much higher than the other qualities is because the OP was just so amazing and addictive. Sadly, the energy and excitement of the OP could not be reflected into the show.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: The characters presented are all very different, and their interactions with each other are very amusing to watch. I would have liked if there was at least some character development, or at least some insight into the characters. Often, characters also give an anime series the drive it needs to go on, but there was nothing about the characters that made you want to know more about them.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: I must say that the enjoyment factor, for me, especially, was quite low compared to many other people. This show was extremely hyped, and many many people were saying how amazing it was, and how funny it was. When I watched, I was extremely dissapointed. I even sat the series through to the end to see if I was missing something, or if the &quot;amazingness&quot; came later on. it didnt. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the anime I enjoy watching has some substance, and there are factors like plot and characters that make me want to keep watching it. Lucky Star didnt cut it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you also prefer animes with more substance, themes, plot, and character, I do not recommend Lucky Star.",

            "content": "I've gotta hand it to you Lucky Star haters, you cease to amaze me. No, I'm not some illogical retard who loves Twilight or crap like that, I'm pretty much one who has logic, in all seriousness I love logic. When you see me posting illogical stuff and me not admitting it, then I was either a) trolling or b) being drunk (I tend to lose myself when it's really late or really early in the morning but not drink beer drunk).\r\nI wanted to write this review because I was just overwhelmed seeing people who hate Lucky Star just because of their whorish fans. Iknow some of your friends keep bitching to you how epic win Lucky Star is and that you MUST, NO MATTER WHAT MUST like Lucky Star but hey I won't force you, I'm just here to tell you,\"NOT ALL LUCKY STAR FANS ARE RETARDS, HENCE STOP STEREOTYPING US.\" That's all.\\n\\n\r\nNow I won't go in the real scoring method (other than for the review itself) of discussing stuff one-by-one but rather, I'll try to argue with the haters' views, call this review some kind of liaison for those of you haven't watched and those who have, loving it or hating it, I assure you I won't get biased.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's get to the most criticized part that I think is getting RIDICULOUS amounts of criticism: THE PLOT. Alright, how many slice-of-life anime shows have no plot? Seriously, a criticism you come up with IT HAS NO STORY LAWL! I'm not trying to offend you, not at all (and I swear I'm not being sarcastic) but that's ridiculous. I've seen lots of anime shows with no plot and I still liked it. Plot or no plot, it's EXECUTION that matters. A game with excellent plot but poor gameplay would probably result in the gamer only finishing it once and not ever again just because of the plot (considering that the gamer likes storylines that is) but a game with poor plot but excellent gameplay would be re-played numerous times like what I do with Devil May Cry 3.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, if this were not a haters-vs-lovers review I'm making, I would rate the plot as -/10 because it's almost non-existent (aside from daily lives) and usually I won't even judge the plot of animes which don't have any solid plot in the first place. What the hell is useful in judging something that's not there? Shows can concentrate on many points: some concentrate on action (hence, art and maybe storyline), some can go on plot stuff (hence, THE PLOT) and some can go for humour (hence, execution) or even slice of life (which is usually based on how well you can relate to it). If you fail to get the premise of my words in this paragraph, you fail it and I'll say to you,\"Go away, you're not worth reading this thing.\"\\n\\n\r\nIt's simple logic really. But to be fair, since these types of Anime (about daily lives of people) are usually just that (aside from some Animes like Honey & Clover which explores far deeper into their lives, making even more sub-plots) I'll give it a 6.5/10 in the review, rounded off to 7. They should have some kind of decimal rating stuff here =_=\\n\\n\r\nAlso, since it's similar to a sitcom where you start off here and end at the same place you started, some may dislike it but I don't really mind. I just feel that instant liking to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThen the art, yeah people have different opinions. I can't say much. It's really love-it-or-hate-it kind of thing so I won't criticize either side for their respective views on this, although I realize that it's purposely acting cute and aiming to be highly-loli-like for teh lulz, some people just won't take this crap >_>\\n\\n\r\nI like the moe and cute art so I give it an 8 here. Yeah call me biased and loli, I won't care when illogical people call on me for no reason at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds, ALSO love-it-or-hate-it. I actually liked the OP song and ED stuff that were sing by Minoru Shiraishi (especially ep 13, 17 and 22) and the soundtrack sounds quite nice. It fits in with the flow and the atmosphere, which is hands-down relaxing. It's a no-brainer that there won't be any epic soundtracks coming from here. I also like the soft OP that was transitioned into an instrumental at Ep 24. If you'd like to compare this anime's OST to, say.. being fair in the slice-of-life genre, Honey & Clover, after some consideration, is comparing a more variety-rich soundtrack in melancholy and whacky pieces (H&C) with a more cheerful and light-toned soundtrack suited for a happy life (LS). I give it an 8. It's excellent at its very best which I more or less expected with its soothing soft music and some great ones. I'd actually recommend you getting this if it weren't for those 10+ BGM CD's that you'd have to get to get them all. Troublesome really, most soundtracks are in 1 CD but this is different =_= feels like they're cashing in or something. With Minoru Shiraishi and the different Character songs, I give this probably 8.4 after more exploration. I couldn't give this an 8.5 or else I'll be rounding off to a 9.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend the whole BGM soundtrack to be honest and maybe 100% nai nai nai on Kagami's Character song. Maybe it's just my taste but I honestly think it's one of the better than most other songs there. Again, people's tastes differ in art so nothing to talk abou here.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuu wasn't all that bad but with so many people having lots of different preferences I can't criticize this point much. Like people say, different people have different opinions, or as one of the anime title say,\"10 people, 10 colours\" which means different people, different minds. I'd like to give the seiyuu a 8 though, seems like the main cast's voice fits too perfects and I feel I sense laziness from some departments but then it's not really annoying or really for the comedy (e.g, most of the extras sound exactly the same).\\n\\n\r\nOnto the characters, I can see how people can dislike Tsukasa, Miyuki and the other side characters but it kinda strikes me how people seem to think that we love Konata simply because she's loli + otaku thus loli otaku thus INSTA-WIN! Or some sort. I, for one, simply love Konata because I actually am like her. I love to procrastinate (but it's slowly going away :D), I love games to death (up to the point that I don't sleep for 31 hours), I love anime too. The similarities make me relate to her in so many ways and being a younger brother, it was interesting to see how she felt being like an older sister, maybe I've never really seen that in my brother before.\\n\\n\r\nNot sure how people hate Konata. Probably they hate her just because other Lucky Star fans who are whores (there are people like these the same way there are Twitards [Twilight Retards]) keep persisting and bitching that she's the best character in the world. Whatever, if you're a hater, here's an advice: they're idiots, don't listen to them. AT ALL.\\n\\n\r\nKagami is your typical tsundere but less of the slapstick tsuntsun or stuff like Louise or Taiga who are world-famous tsundere champs. Honestly I find her character great. She's the responsible type, hell if I will, she's Tohsaka Rin a la Lucky Star. She just socializes more with these friends than Tohsaka Rin from FSN does and honestly Kagami teases people less than what Tohsaka does and is more open than she is (sadly, if you don't know her, then you could ask around, she's like a common house-hold name in Anime these days >_>). One of her main attractive features is probably her looks, her hairstyle and her behaviour + chemistry with Konata.\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa, Kagami's younger sister is your typical moe, shy, cutesy-cute character who's the pinnacle of air-heads in Lucky Star. Yeah I can still see how people hate her. Air-heads like these are sometimes boring characters and honestly, I never truly loved her the way I loved Kagami and Konata so yeah.\\n\\n\r\nMiyuki though, I can get why people dislike her, again. She's the glasses girl - silent, not too out-going, caring, helpful, wears glasses, is clumsy - and the usual smart type. Over-used stereotype, I know so I won't be bashing either side for loving or hating it although so far I think I've only criticized a hater. Tell me where I'm wrong and I'd love to ask you some stuff and for you to ask me some stuff so I can see why people hate this so much.\\n\\n\r\nI believe people hated ep 1 - 4 because their director was changed after ep 4 and it got a whole lot better in my opinion so I invite everyone who's just started on the series or have not started the series to watch till like episode 6 to 8 and after that episode I won't force you to watch anymore if you still dislike it since it's either a) it's not your thing or b) it's not your thing. I'm not some whore who won't take the fact that people can dislike what I love.\\n\\n\r\nThen the conversations, although shallow, I can relate too. I've wondered about many things that even this anime has covered and I love this feeling. I've also talked with some people about stuff Konata and co. have too. Also different situations like opening a bag of chips for someone, blocking the straw opening so that the water sticks there and acting all immature and pointing to how cool it is (actually I went as far as going to my science teacher to ask about this, but that was lots of years ago), how I pull an all-nighter right before a test, etc and etc.\\n\\n\r\nThe humour is also dependent on how your humour goes. If you're into the references and the soft humour stuff then Lucky Star is great but honestly, I find this series as a whole not that incredibly funny or Hayate no Gotoku!-like in anyway. It's pretty unfair comparing them in my opinion but hey it's MY opinion so who gives a shit right? It isn't YOURS so I'm not bashing YOUR opinion unless you have a crooked and baseless opinion which I've seen from the Anti-Lucky Star club who I'd love to discuss with why they hate the series WITHOUT flaming or anything of the sort. I've seen in their thread, some people posting that the show has no plot (explained), sucky art, sound and characters (explained) and their friends keep whoring on them and say it's the best show and if you don't like it = u fail. Well I'm here to tell you, just like a motivator like Adam Khoo or Tucker Max or some sort of motivator guy, say \"NO U!\" to THEM!\\n\\n\r\nI've got a friend who doesn't like the types of genre I like but I don't go around her and keep choking her to death yelling,\"WATCH THIS OR I'LL KILL YOUR KITTENS AND HAUNT UR CHILDREN!!!!!\" or shit like that, honestly, if you have friends like that, then you should consider first, if your friends are SMART people or IDIOTS, which I think majority are. If they can't even get people have different opinions (autism aside), then they are complete fuck-ups, idiots, failure to logic, immature, etc etc etc etc etc.\\n\\n\r\nNever listen to what other people like those say. Honestly, I actually follow some hypes (e.g Shakugan no Shana, Lucky Star, Zero no Tsukaima) my friends give me but after that I rely on MY OWN opinion, not theirs and my opinions are made from a base and that base is solid. Rarely is the base of my opinions a crooked one and if it is I'll freely admit it or if I'm feeling like an asshole, I'll change ID and register a new user (heheh :P that was like years ago though).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed the series and I don't care what YOU think. If you find this review helpful, then thank you very much, if you don't, then I don't blame you and I won't be cursing your name a million times, it's up to you. God I don't get why people care so much what other people think sometimes. You've got opinions, I've got mine and sometimes people just have crooked opinions and that's why I wrote this.\\n\\n\r\nI really don't find the point in criticizing an Anime that has no plot as a shallow anime that has no plot as if pointing out that those white lab rats don't have tails compared to normal rats which have tails thus the lab rat is a bad rat and thus we must burn in into the haet-oven.\\n\\n\r\nSo, whatever the hype, don't trust it for this anime or you may get utterly disappointed. I followed the hype and I got what I wanted (well after ep 1 I was disappointed but things got better afterwards). If you hate it and you don't want to be convinced, then I don't care. If you hate it and want some discussions on why it's so damn popular, please do talk with me on the forums or any other place. If you love it, then so do I! Yeah all in all I give this anime a 9/10 for me but in general, for all of you, it's probably a 7.8 on average\\n\\n\r\nAlthough in my opinion Honey & Clover runs deeper, into the more confused melancholy adolescent and that people may call 'pathetic' and 'emo' and 'self-loathing' (irks me that they never ever felt down THAT much before in their lives, guess people have it luckier) and maybe even philosophical stuff, Lucky Star does not go that far and does not fail to deliver simple everyday things or zanier things but still make it interesting.\\n\\n\r\nTo haters: simply put, any slice-of-life anime does not depend on plot. They depend on their characters and how much you can relate to them. OP does not matter, ED does not matter, what matters is how much you can relate to them and don't let any fangirls get the better of you and make you hate it. I've always been trolled with Naruto by my friends but I shrug it off, who cares really? Honestly, my point is if you can't relate to it, then you won't like it. That's my view of what slice-of-life animes really should be like. Why do I love t? I truly love the Konata and Kagami's personalitie and chemistry. I can relate to Konata and Kagami the most too. I don't express myself that well and yet I'm very much a Konata without the-- oh wait maybe I do act lazy. Really, to be honest, if you watch it from episode 6 and skip 1 - 5 you probably won't be lost anyway. P.S I AM NO LOLICON - I don't love them for their loliness thank you very much. Who ever said we love loli anyway >_>\\n\\n\r\nSide note: I love Shiraishi Medley and Orewa suremono :D",

            "content": "My review.. I'm not really trying to say you shouldnt  watch this anime, some people like it, some people don't. But on my opinion i think this anime is as boring asd you can get. The sound is ok really cute and funny, that i can't complain, but the art.. some people say its cute and simple, i say its way too simple and not that cute to be honest, i've seen much cutter characters such as chibis and so. The storyline.. I really think thats the worst part in it, i firsts started seeing this anime because it was kinda cute, i wastold that Konata was exactly like me, so i went to see it, very amusing at first, but as it goes on.. it turns to be a REAL drag.. Its basicly always the same, school, home, shoping, konata bein all about videogames, anime and manga, kagami arguing with konata, tsukasa stating the obvious with konata and miyuki being the smart girl there.\\n\r\nIts basicly nothing new, always the same in each episode, and to be honest, the anim aint really that funny.. It rarely makes me laugh, and its not that i have no sense of humor or that i never did those experiences! I do have sence of humor and i had most of those experiences. But seriously i don't see whats funny about it, but that my opinion anyways, of course we all dont share the same opinion and i respect otherts opinions. But this is how i see things, and i reall. i dont think this anime is worth the ranking it has..\\n\\n\r\nEven a friend of mine that loves cute animes and such, like Shugo chara and Suzumiya Haruhi, she started seeing lucky star and enjoyed it, but has she went on she just said: Man you were right.. ._. that anime is cute and all but its making me so bored, ill see it later when i have the guts ^^'\\n\\n\r\nOne more person saying the same as i.\\n\\n\r\nI think the only good aspects about the anime are the sound and the characters, like you all say, gotta love Konata X)\\n\\n\r\nAnyways this is just my opinion! Don't blame me im not a lucky star hater >.",

            "content": "Lucky * Star is about highschool girls and.. ummm, well, that's about it. It basically revolves around the lives of four girls (later on, more people are given some time) and the random conversations they have.\r\nStory \r\nThis series is not incredibly plot filled. Actually, there really is none. It's not even really character driven. This anime, however, doesn't need much of a story. It still works out in a cute way. However, the rating IS for story, and in all fairness, there really was none. I think this is a fair, if not quite high rating for what was presented.\r\nAnimation \r\nThe best animation is definitlyin the opening sequence. Everything flows nicely in it, and it throws money around to give a flawless performance. Once you get to the actual show, however, there is basically no movement what so ever, save the talking. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style isn't top notch. It is kept with the original 4-koma's style, but I still think they could have coloured it a bit better. Maybe make the girls atleast look more their age.\\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\r\nI did really like that opening song. Quite catchy. The in-show music was also fairly well done, aside from the fact that I didn't really notice it. The music just kind of melted into the background. That's the only reason why it's not higher on my rating. It was good, but nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter \\n\r\nThis was my biggest issue. The series had INCREDIBLY 2-dimensional characters. They did not develope, they did not change. We did no see any different sides to them. The closest to this was with Konata, and... whatever her name is. The older of the twins. \\n\\n\r\nThis may have been alright, because this would seriously screw up the nature of the anime, but because of the 2-D element to them, I couldn't really connect to any of them. Except maybe Konata. I'm a big nerd too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \\n\r\nWhile I did have a few giggles, I did not either really like this series, or really dislike it. I can see why people like it, but I don't understand the overwhelming popularity. I was told it was funny, but it wasn't a comedy. It was slice-of-life. I was told it was meaningful. That was a load of bull. I watched the series with no expectations, and I ended it with none. I don't see myself rewatching this anytime soon.\\n\\n\r\nOverall / My Comments / My Feelings \\n\r\nI know people will be angry, but it wasn't an overall amazing show. It has no story, the art was pretty boring, the sound disappeared, and the characters were 2-D. The only thing this series had that I liked was the otaku jokes. Other than that, I couldn't relate. Highschool isn't like this for me. Not at all. And I don't know people who are so stereotypical. I was a little disappointed, I think.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say anything but, sorry fans. I just couldn't get myself hooked. I atleast pulled through all the episodes, but it was becoming a little draining towards the end. I had no real drive to finish it...",

            "content": "Story: There isn't really a main story, the series revolves around the daily life of 4 high school girls.  This series is based on a Japanese 4-panel comic strip, and as comic strips go, the contents can be just about any topics that come to mind.  Though there's no main story (people gets judgmental about this), people overlook the fact it is BECAUSE there's no main story, there's no restrictions to what the series can talk about.\r\nArt: The art style from the anime were pretty much the same as from the manga.  There wasn't any inconsistencies and the animation was relatively smooththe entire time.  The characters/backgrounds were drawn the way they are because...again...this series is derived from a 4-panel comic strip.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The BGM blends with the episodes very well.  The opening song always got me pumped up to watch the episodes no matter what kind of mood I was in at the moment.  The ending songs were all taken from somewhere else and sung by the voice actors, and most of them were absolutely hilarious (especially Hare Hare Yukai sung by Shiraishi Minoru along with the 2 player fighting game training mode simulator).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: What's done so well about the character development is that you learn about the characters the same way you learn about someone in real life, from their casual conversations in school.  Even though this is a comedy, there are some dramatic scenes here and there showing some of the character's life at home.  There's also a wide variety of characters (who're normal and aren't golden haired, KI blasting, walking slabs of muscles) for the viewer to relate to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really like how this is a show that you can just pick up and enjoy without knowing the contents of the previous episodes.  There are also many references, so many that a normal person (who doesn't watch much anime or play games) wouldn't be able to understand more than half of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The thing about Lucky Star is that not everyone's going to like it.  This show is aimed towards regular anime watchers/gamers.  Those who are not anime watchers will be confused at the references, older people may think it's plotless insanity, and younger people may not understand the jokes.  \\n\\n\r\nWith that said, if you're an anime watcher (if you're taking time to read this I'd bet you are), this show will be an absolute blast.  This anime is the KING of referencing, and with each episodes being a synthesis of small events, you'll never guess what could happen next.\\n\\n\r\n**Brief Warning**\\n\r\nThe first few episodes of the series may seem boring at first, but they're for introducing the 4 main characters.  No matter what you may think, keep watching, give it a chance.  By episode 10 or so, you will not regret sticking with this series.",

            "content": "Lucky Star\r\nStory (6/10)\r\nThe story here was by far the hardest thing for me to rate. Being a comedy/slice-of-life type of thing, Lucky Star has no real \"plot-line\" or story. You could skip 5 episodes and still understand what was going on. However, the day-to-day goings and doings of the 4 main characters was done decently, and the variety of what they did was okay, so therefore I gave it a 6, which is fair/decent. \r\nOne thing I have to say though: After episode 10-ish or so, things were really getting boring. Sure, what they did was different, but the jokes had the same principle, andit was just all so boring and repetitive. Especially the stupid Lucky Channel. God, I skipped over that so many times. Because it was boring and... oh god. I can't even bring myself to go on. But since there isn't all that much plot, I can't sit here and elaborate on it forever, so moving on...\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nThough I don't like Kyoto Animation all that much, the good thing about them is the animation that they do is very good (though I personally don't like the style all that much). Everything flowed nicely and there was never a time where I thought &quot;Wow, they're running low on their budget&quot; or &quot;Wow, they got really lazy with that scene.&quot; But I'll be honest and say I really did not like the art style. The characters are supposed to be 17/18 and they looked like they were 10. Some people may call it cute and chibi but I call it ugly and stupid.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nAnother good thing about Lucky Star is the sound quality. Most notably the great job done by the seiyuu. Kudos to them for doing an excellent job. Other than that, the sound was nothing more and nothing less than decent. The BGM was fitting and non-annoying, the opening was cutesy and funny, but nothing special. The various endings were occasionally humorous but not a lot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10)\\n\r\nSince Lucky Star is a comedy, serious character development isn't exactly on its agenda. The characters were varied to some extent -- we have the various archetypes to fill, the tsundere, the moe blob, the smart/clumsy one, and the... otaku? However, this is as deep as the character gets. Saying you can relate to Konata because you also like anime/manga is like saying you can also relate to Miyuki because she is a high school student. There is no depth or development and the &quot;variety&quot; of characters only go as far as stereotypical archtypes that you can find in almost any other anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\\n\r\nSince the &quot;enjoyment&quot; part of the review is just a personal opinion, I don't let it affect my score. But needless to say, I did not enjoy Lucky Star. I can safely say I did not laugh once while watching this. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 is because despite Konata being a shallow character, I liked her for many reasons and it was almost some fun to watch her go about her daily otaku lifestyle among normal-ish friends. But a comedy without humor is like a cow with no spots. If you want to go laugh, watch Azumanga Daioh instead, a comedy with much more humor that you can't help but smile at. Lucky Star tried to bring us a cute and relaxing slice-of-life comedy and an otaku we can all relate to,  but in my opinion it utterly failed.",

            "content": "5 WORDS OR LESS REVIEW: Hysterically Funny\r\nI don&rsquo;t think I watched anything like Lucky Star before. I know people say it&rsquo;s a bit over hyped, or that it&rsquo;s nothing compared to Azumanga Daioh or Pani Poni Dash! but there is something to Lucky Star. That&rsquo;s why a lot of people, including me, like it. Let me enumerate on why I like it.\r\nI like the story. Sure there isn&rsquo;t much of a definite storyline, but that&rsquo;s what makes it easy to understand. Besides, it&rsquo;s a slice of life anime of four regular high school girls (well, maybe Konata&rsquo;s a little different) so you shouldn&rsquo;t expect anythingout of the ordinary. Even if it is like that, it still manages to entertain me and crack me up, and doing that with such little material is a hard task.\\n\\n\r\nI would say Lucky Star is very otaku oriented, as it makes fun of anime and otaku clich&eacute;s. Other than that, it makes use of a lot of spoofs and parodies to create comedy, which is a strength depending on how you look at it. It&rsquo;s a strength because it&rsquo;s great for full fledged otaku viewers, but it&rsquo;s a weakness if casual anime fans fans (those who don&rsquo;t watch anime on a regular basis, I suppose) try to watch it. They probably won&rsquo;t get the spoofs. Sure they can do some research on it, but I guess it wouldn&rsquo;t be as funny that way.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a huge part of the comedy, because they themselves are clich&eacute;s. Tsukasa is a moe character, while Miyuki is a meganekko. Kagami is a little tsundere, and of course, legendary girl A herself, Konata Izumi, is the rabid otaku. Out of all the girls, Konata has to be my favorite. I guess it&rsquo;s because I see myself in her. I guess there&rsquo;s a little Konata in every otaku out there. The extended cast is also hilarious, like Minoru Shiraishi and Akira of the Lucky Channel segment, as well as the characters&rsquo; relatives and their classmates.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Minoru Shiraishi, I have to say that Lucky Star did wonders for his career. I think he&rsquo;s more famous than before, and he&rsquo;s not even a main character. As for the other VAs, it&rsquo;s definitely a great cast. Two of my favorite VAs, Aya Hirano (Konata, of course) and Tomokazu Seki (Meito Anisawa) are in it, so that&rsquo;s one reason for me to be happy. Even the one episode extras are awesome Tomokazu Sugita and Daisuke Ono made cameo appearances for Lucky Star. You also gotta love Fumihiko Tachiki, who played all the random old woman characters throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nNow to discuss another popular rant. People are let down by the art style of Lucky Star, because it&rsquo;s so different from other KyoAni series (Kanon 2006, Air, etc). I see this as a positive. The characters are cuter that way, and being different is a good thing. Visually, Kanon 2006 and Air look great, but the character designs are a bit commonplace and standard. Lucky Star gives a breath of fresh air, that&rsquo;s what I like to think. The characters, colors, backgrounds &ndash; everything. Everything (visually) about Lucky Star is cute, another strength of Lucky Star.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also otaku oriented. For the first half, most of the songs are themes from actual anime. Aya Hirano&rsquo;s rendition of &ldquo;Cha-la Head Cha-la&rdquo; has to be one of my favorites from Lucky Star. I also like Minoru Shiraishi&rsquo;s rendition of &ldquo;Hare Hare Yukai&rdquo; and &ldquo;Motteke! Serafuku&rdquo;\\n\\n\r\nTo end this review, I think Lucky Star is a great anime. It certainly has its merits, and I understand why a lot of people like it. However, I understand that it&rsquo;s not perfect, and that it cannot please everybody.",

            "content": "Lucky star is one of those unique Comedy anime that comes very rarely. It manages to put a comedic twist to normal everyday occurances, and many pop culutre references. The entire show is not your typical slice of life high school comedy anime, rather its show structure follows more of a western style of comedy, a sitcom to be exact. Instead  of having a direct storyline, like  most anime viewers are used to, it focuses more of everyday observations and Jpop culture as their source of comedy.\r\n---Theres always a storyline no matter how broad it is. Many ppl say theres no story linebut, there has to be a &quot;story&quot; of sorts or else this stuff cant be funny. If you had to put a plot to this show it would &quot;A group of high school children trying to make it all the way through high school.&quot; With such a broad plot, the creators can do as they please. By the way, that is how most western sitcoms can list 5-10 seasons without it getting old (i.e. Simpsons, Family Guy, Cheers, etc.) Mind you thats the only connection this show has with a western sitcom. \\n\r\n---I have noticed many people bash the begging episodes of the show but i found them equally entertaining as the rest of them. It really depends on what the viewer does in their own daily lives is what truly makes this show funny. Somone who doesnt eat curry/rice or grilled meat sticks for dinner with their family wont understand a joke about it. But with all the jokes and references  in this show you're bound to laugh out loud at all they throw at you! They've thoguht of everything for this show. \\n\\n\r\n---Art and animation of the show is your typical comedy anime fair. Simple characters simple backgrounds simple static objects. But they manage to take &quot;simple&quot; to a whole different level. For example, the characters are only shown from the waist up for about 80% of the entire show. But the characters are drawn very simplistic and the coloring for each looks like it doesnt exeed 12 different colors for each person for the most part. But they are definitely drawn in a cute manner, if thats your thing. The simple-ness is what gives the show its charm too. The art style is so popular and easy to draw im sure you'll find spoofs for dozens of other non related characters around the internet. \\n\\n\r\n---The Sound is your standard comedy sound efects from light hearted piano songs, to bing bangs and bongs, they're all there and accounted for. Music is mostly absent from the show aside from helping out certain jokes.\\n\r\n---You will definitely notice the lack of background music in the show but with such a powerful seiyu cast, one could understand that they didnt want to distract from the well executed voice acting. Of course most people will notice Aya Hirano and maybe even Minori Chihara. Its hard to believe that most of the main characters are voiced by relatively newcomers. Which also helps seperate Lucky Star from sounding the same as all the other school anime out there. You'll enjoy Kagami's singing voice by the way. \\n\\n\r\nWith the uniqe sound comes the &quot;unique&quot; (or not so unique) character types associated with each seiyu.  Theres also ALOT more characters but you'll have to watch it to see them all ^_^  Speaking of characters you'll actually end up seeing all of them fairly regurlarly. Either supporting cast or main cast. By the end of the show, you'll get the feeling that not one person recieved more time than another. Even the extra characters get more than enough airtime to fully acknowledge them as essential parts of the anime. \\n\\n\r\n---The enjoyment factor is through the roof in my opinion. The comedy aspect of this show covers so many angles and hits so many things perfectly its hard not to give a perfect score. I find it very hard for somone to hate this anime. That is, if you dont like japanese pop cultre, anime references and funny common occurences. If youre that type then why are you watching anime? ^_^\\n\r\n---Also, if you dont like western style sitcoms where the end of every episode will always leave the same way they started, this is definitely not for you. If youre looking for a romantic comedy or bloody action school go somewhere else.  If you're willing to give up about 20 minutes of your time for pure entertainment, WATCH THIS SHOW!\\n\\n\r\nIf you find anything funnier pm me i'll give it a shot but for now this the funniest anime i've watched to date ^_^",

            "content": "\"This is so BORING!\" is what most of you will say if you watch it.\r\nI'll admit, that is what I thought at first, and I stopped watching on the first episode when they were talking about which side is the head of a \"chocolate cornet bread\"... But after a while, I gave it another try, and this time, I watched patiently and watched through the entire first episode. I was still not impressed, and still bored. I moved on to the next episode, and as you can tell by my over-all rating of a 10, I loved the rest. Now here is why:\r\nThe story, isnon-existent (as I will put no emphasis on story in this review). But that was one of the main reasons I loved it. There was no tension, no fighting, no drama, no heart-breaks. Just pure comedy. \\n\r\nComedy? Well, there's nothing that will make you roll over. But, there are countless moments where it makes you smile, many times even chuckles if you get the jokes. \\n\r\nThe comedy works in this anime by having the characters go through moments where you go like, \"OH I feel you!\", \"I totally know what you mean!, or \"Ah so glad I am not the only one who does that!\". That's why it's really funny in a way, making this the most accurate \"slice of life\" I have ever viewed. \\n\r\nThe English dub for this anime is pretty amazing (for once), the voice actor for Konata, the main character, does a wonderful job of bring her to life. The characters are all likable, but Konata is one of the best characters I have seen, and she manages to do all that without geass powers or sword skills, too. I don't want to spoil anything, so I will leave it up to you to find out more about why I find Konata so great.\\n\r\nAlso, it's a huge plus if you are exposed to Japanese culture (real life), because many of the jokes is about the daily life there and you will only get the jokes if you have experienced it (there aren't that many, so don't worry).\\n\r\nTo sum it up, Lucky Star is about the daily life of the girls, there won't be any conflicts like there are in many slice of life anime, this anime is very peaceful, and you can relate to many of the characters.\\n\r\nGive it a try! Watch a few clips of it! Type in \"Funny Lucky Star Moments\" on Youtube and see for yourself! If you like it, WATCH IT. Don't marathon it, in fact, watch an episode after a long day, or better yet, watch it to calm your nerves after something like Code Geass/Death Note. Thank you",

            "content": "There is nothing in entertainment worse than bad comedy.\r\nBad drama, horror, romance, or action at least has the possibility of being amusing, if only for purely ironical purposes, and watching something which is intended to be serious completely fail can be surprisingly fun (see MST3K). However, watching something try to be funny and fail is hardly ever amusing in the slightest, and amounts, for me at least, to the epitome of nauseating boredom. In the anime world, Lucky Star is perhaps the best (and at the very least the most popular) example of bad comedy ever made.\r\nNow, it is more or less universally agreed uponamongst Lucky Star's detractors that the show is, quite simply, \"unfunny.\" At the same time however, it is not always explained in detail why or how it is unfunny. But before delving into the specifics, I will freely admit from the outset that comedy is probably the most subjective and difficult of all genres (I myself have some bizarre comedic tastes) to review. Nevertheless, I believe Lucky Star merits special attention, along with a special place in Hell, for how unprecedentedly unfunny it is. This is also why I chose it for my inaugural anime review.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the \"humor\" of Lucky Star is derived from two sources: 1) Discussions about everyday life experience (e.g. food, homework, clothes), and 2) References (either verbal or visual) to other anime franchises and various anime-related tropes. As for the first, Lucky Star makes the awful mistake of assuming that simply because something is true or commonly experienced, it is funny. Thus the episodes are crammed with inane, excruciatingly detailed conversational gems like\\n\\n\r\nPerson 1: \"You know how when it's cold outside, you want to stay inside for longer?\"\\n\r\nPerson 2: \"Haha yeah, I've totally been there!\"\\n\\n\r\nor\\n\\n\r\nPerson 1: \"You know how when you have a lot of stuff to do, you clean your room instead?\"\\n\r\nPerson 2: \"Haha yeah, I've done that before!\"\\n\\n\r\nYou get the idea. The whole \"funny because it's true\" thing in my experience only works if it is comingled with an adequate amount of absurdity or exaggeration (for an example, see Mike Judge's films). Lucky Star, on the other hand, aims for pure realism in all its dullness. With this \"comedic\" logic, they may as well assume that simply because I have eaten food before, I will think that watching people eat food is funny; furthermore, I will think that people talking about eating food is also funny. What makes this method even more ridiculous for Lucky Star is the fact that one must be rather extensively versed in Japanese culture to even \"get\" a lot of these \"jokes,\" let alone find them funny.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the anime references, this is where the annoyance factor truly rears its ugly head. Typically, an outside reference to another anime is funny because it is unexpected and well-timed. Lucky Star on the other hand, crams in as many references as it possibly can, many of which are to other works from Kyoto Animation. As one might imagine, this not only gets incredibly dull, but also unbearably irritating as the show progresses. By far the most frequent and most facepalm-inducing are the references to the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Granted, this trick was somewhat amusing the first time, but by the end of the series, the Haruhi references become so frequent, so bland, and so obvious that I literally began slamming my head into my desk. Thus like the reference to \"everyday life,\" the references to anime make the assumption that just because we have seen the shows referenced, that we will find the references funny. Are we really supposed to pat ourselves on the back and quietly snicker to ourselves for being \"in the know\"? It seems like the real reason for all these anime references is a) a clever form of product-placement and b) riding on the success of vastly superior franchises (Full Metal Panic, Haruhi Suzumiya, the Key-game shows). The only reference that actually made me chuckle a bit (and not immediately roll my eyes or want to punch my computer screen) was the part in episode 13 where one of the shop employees uses his \"Geass\" on Konata to get her to buy a DVD, only to find that she is three yen short.\\n\\n\r\nNow typically, in order to use reference-parodies like this successfully, one ought to find a way to integrate them in a creative and subtle way, and there are many examples of this in anime alone. Lucky Star, on the other hand, particularly when parodying well-known anime tropes, squanders its comedic potential by feeling the need to tell you exactly what they are parodying. Therefore, whenever Miyuki trips or turns off the light by accident, or Yutaka mentions that she is frail and \"sick all the time,\" we are sure to have Konata not far off to immediately comment how incredibly \"moe\" she is. Ha. Ha. Ha. There is a similar delivery style with \"tsundere,\" \"fanservice,\" and other related terms and cliches. Watching this is like listening to someone tell a joke only to quickly explain the punchline before the audience even has a chance to laugh.\\n\\n\r\nAesthetically, there is not terribly much to say other than I find it amazing that even here Lucky Star manages to add yet another layer of annoyance. The characters were clearly designed to resemble the (equally unfunny) manga as closely as possible, and the result is not pleasing. The foreground and background art is lackluster and totally generic, not to mention the core girls all look waaaay too young (and not just in a typical \"moe\" way) for being in high school. Such failure in this department is all the more surprising knowing that this show was produced by Kyoto Animation, a studio which, among other things, is particularly well known for its beautiful and groundbreaking visual styling. In Lucky Star, there is no such evidence whatsoever that this is the same company who did Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid, Air, or Kanon. I suspect the real reason Kyoto took this project on was because of potential legal issues surrounding the ludicrous amounts of references to their other works. Other than that, the music consists of bland, forgettable five-note pieces typical for this kind of show. Except worse.\\n\\n\r\nSetting aside for a moment what Lucky Star has brings up the important issue of what it does not have. In fact, one of Lucky Star's most subtle and yet most serious detriments is the almost complete absence of visual humor of any kind (the stock anime-facial-expressions aside). The show is quite simply a bunch of talking heads, and as something in the medium of animation, Lucky Star feels incredibly out of place; 99% of the show consist of dialogue and dialogue only. Suffice it to say, this show was a complete and unfortunate waste of Kyoto's talent.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, my biggest problem with Lucky Star, and the reason why I have been compelled to write this review, is that it basically gives slice of life comedy a bad name--something which is all the more compounded by its rabid popularity. It is not at all unlikely that someone who has never seen a slice of life show will first see Lucky Star and then assume that the entire genre is of similar quality. After all, comments like \"nothing happens\" and \"there's no plot\" are fairly common amongst complaints from Lucky Star haters. Unfortunately, I believe people may be missing out on a lot of great, funny, clever slice of life shows \"where there's no plot\" (Fumoffu, Azumanga Daioh, Minami-ke) if Lucky Star does indeed manage to taint them so severely. It is interesting to note that Lucky Star is perhaps most often mentioned along with the classic Azumanga Daioh, and the comparison is not at all unmerited: both shows are based off of a four-panel manga about a group of quirky high school girls and their antics. However, once the stylistic similarities are brushed aside, you are left with two anime which could not be more diametrically opposed. That is, whereas Azumanga Daioh represents the pinnacle of comedy done right, Lucky Star represent the pinnacle of comedy done wrong; whereas Azumanga Daioh uses \"random conversations about food\" in a broader, situational context to give them humorous contrast, Lucky Star takes this device to a ridiculous extreme--it makes an entire show out of it to the expense of nearly everything else. The difference between Azumanga's Osaka and Lucky Star's Konata is that the former is one character amongst many, whereas the latter is only an otaku-pandering, watered-down Osaka amongst many other watered-down Osaka's, without any significant personality contrast. In Lucky Star, there is no one to sarcastically say \"wow, you have a really vivid imagination...\" but rather the one-note \"joke\" of \"randomness\" continues on into senseless oblivion. If Azumanga Daioh is a bright beacon of joyful, energetic laughter, Lucky Star is a dark pit of disparaging, cynical boredom (if you'll excuse the melodramatic language). It basically takes the slice of life genre but does not fill it with any real content, leaving naught but an empty husk.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you want a creative, genuine, funny slice-of-life comedy and not simply a long otaku in-joke set on repeat, avoid Lucky Star like the plague.",

            "content": "When I first looked into Lucky Star, I thought I was going to be impressed. People in the anime club I help run wanted to watch this series so bad and it ended up in 4th place, so we weren't able to show it this semester. Still, I wanted to know what the appeal of Lucky Star was. The chibi art made the anime look unique and interesting, and I thought that I couldn't go wrong with an anime series that was so popular. This is where \"looks can be deceiving\" really comes into play.\r\nDespite the cute art, which got annoying very quickly, Lucky Starreally fell on its face form the get-go. The story had nothing to offer. Basically, you spend twenty-four episodes watching a group of high school girls run around, talk to each other, make jokes, and dance. I have completely summarized the entire series for you in that last sentence, and I'm not kidding. Each episode was a repeat as the last, except for character problems and issues, and after every episode I said, \"Alright, it still has to get better from here,\" and it never did. The only thing that ever improved was the Lucky Channel, but that was because I didn't have to hear Akira's annoying squeaking in the last three or so episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI know that the story is suppose to be based around a comedic high school cast, but to be honest, the comedy was terrible. In order to get most of the jokes, one would have to know a lot in video games, anime, and Japanese puns. Now, I don't know a lot of video games or Japanese puns, so those jokes failed, and the anime jokes that I did get surfaced once in a while, and that type of comedy was absolutely terrible. I think I snickered maybe once or twice during the entire series. Yes, the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with Lucky Star's terrible story and comedy choice, I found myself hating most of the characters. The only half-way decent characters were shown in the last half of the anime, and those characters really weren't anything special. Most of the weren't dynamic, lacking originality, and went along with the same thing over and over again. When those sparks of originality were shown, they were quickly covered by the same old, bland things that happened through out the entire series. A great example comes from Konata, the main girl with blue hair and green eyes. She runs around every episode, talks about food, anime, video games, and how she was late or tired because she stayed up all night playing video games. Kagami, one of the lavender haired twins, is exactly the same way - smart, angered easily, and is very poor at house chores. Miyuki, the pink haired girl with glasses, is klutsy, \"moe\", intelligent, and formal with her speech. I could go on and on, but I don't think it's needed.\\n\\n\r\nWith the characters, art, and story quickly falling apart, I turned to something I thought would work - the music. I learned quickly, however, that the music was only a little better than everything else. Some of the songs sounded like they were recorded on a cellphone and then placed into the show. It wasn't that the quality was bad, but rather than the music used was very bland, unoriginal, and lacked dynamic, not that the story had any of those or anything. The music fit the series alright, but by itself, the music would just be a waste of space on whatever drive you would be listening to it on. Even the opening theme was annoying.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with all of these things said, I'm surprised that I made it to the last episode. Now, it's safe to say that just because I didn't enjoy it doesn't mean that others won't. Obviously, the MAL rating for Lucky Star fights any point that I've made against the series. However, I will not be recommending Lucky Star to any of my friends. Ever. In fact, I will tell them to avoid it, and to be fair in my fight, I don't think it deserves the popularity it has. Sure it's cute, but that's about it.",

            "content": "In the year 2007 A.D., a fire was brewing in the Kyoto Animation studio. Fresh off the success of Haruhi Suzumiya and smelling of farts and ramen-scented body odor, the staff of KyoAni developed an ingenious plan to further milk countless wads of cashmoney from pathetic losers and pedophiles on both sides of the pacific: take a popular 4 panel comic series ripe with the elements that made Suzumiya a financial success (pandering to shut in weeaboos with lolicon action figure collections and terabytes of hentai) and turn it into an equally horrendous anime series. After spending tireless hours handcrafting only the stalest jokes, theblandest artwork, and the most mindnumbingly boring scripts in Japanese television history, Yushiro Takemoto opened his anus and took a massive shit onto a nearby Tokyo sidewalk. Millions gawked at the magnitude of his feces: proportions this great hadn't been seen since U2 released the waterboarding-like torturefest that was \"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\" in 2004. Once Norwegian scientists had been given proper time to mass, perform tests on, and take pictures with said shit, Takemoto was told he needed to give it a name. He chose Lucky Star.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like those gag electric shock pens you gave out to your friends as a prank in the 4th grade, Lucky Star tricks you into watching it under the guise that it's a \"comedy\", but in reality it's less of a laugh-fest and more of an exercise in sadomasochism. Half-way through the first episode I was convinced that having to watch this must be the wrath of a vengeful God, intent on punishing me for my past missteps and failures. By episode 2 I had been reduced to a vegetable, as the show had literally sucked all the energy from me. By episode 9 this condition became chronic, as I had turned my once-lovely living room into a wasteland and my once clean underwear into a net for catching the diarrhea that seeped from my petrified asshole. By episode 16 I had gathered enough energy to attempt suicide. After a short recovery stint in the hospital, I was put on anti-depressants and bear tranquilizers, and sooner or later I told my therapist that I needed to conquer my demons once and for all and finish this series. He approved, but only on one condition: that I watch it with him present in the room. I tried to talk sense into him, but he insisted that \"he's seen a lot of things in his time, alot of them a lot worse than anything a Japanese cartoon could throw at him.\"\\n\\n\r\nHe later shot himself in a Staples parking lot.\\n\\n\r\nTo put it plainly, Lucky Star is the antithesis of entertainment. There is nothing funny, clever, witty, or remotely interesting about the show. Weeaboo faggots will desperately try to convince you that this series is a comedic masterpiece and a pinnacle of artistic achievement, but as the first five minutes clearly establish, this couldn't be farther from the truth. Lucky Star is only revolutionary in how much it's able to bore anyone that isn't a drooling fuckstick with social anxiety disorder---you will truly think that this anime transcended time and space to deliver you a universe-shattering kick in the nuts, unless you find Meet The Spartans type reference jokes funny and obviously pre-pubescent anime girls hot, in which case you will love this show like the fucking loser you are. Many have compared this show to Seinfeld because the two share a \"show-about-nothing\" approach to narrative storytelling, but this is where all logical comparisons end. Seinfeld is a groundbreaking TV series about the hilarious exploits of a group of really big assholes in New York. Lucky Star is a show about the various non-incidents in the lives of a bunch of \"this-is-what-weeaboos-wish-girls-were-like\" high schoolers that have dull-as-fuck conversations, fit neatly inside cliche archetypes without ever evolving, and make a lot of cringe-worthy pop culture references.\\n\\n\r\nBut pure shittiness alone is not enough to propel this anime to the bottom-of-the-barrel status it's currently at. What really gets me about Lucky Star is just how much the \"FEED ME MORE MONEY\" attitude of Kyoto Animation leaks into the actual production. Every time I endure a painfully boring discussion about some every-day life topic, another unfunny Lucky Channel skit, the explanation and, in turn, ruination of what otherwise would've been a passable joke, or some reference to Haruhi/[insert video game and/or anime here] it brings me back to the actual intended purpose of this series. The characters, situations, and jokes are all purposely written to be engaging to shut-in dorks who spend most of their lives watching anime, playing video games, and posting on internet message boards. It's the hollowest anime I've ever watched; it soullessly and maliciously appeals to people who are too pathetic to realize that they're being pandered to for cash---if you paid money to see any part of this show and AREN'T one of these people, you will walk away from the experience feeling like someone shot you in the knees and proceeded to steal your house, car, identity, and wife. It's an anime designed to be watched amongst anime club meetings filled with people who force out dry heaves of laughter so they can feel like they fit in with everyone around them, and on projector screens at anime conventions filled with freaks dressed up as animals and Sailor Moon characters. This show was not created out of passion, or a general love for the medium, or an actual belief that the show would be funny, it was created to exploit the lowest common denominator of anime fans for a quick buck. It's taking money from people who don't know any better, it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and takes away any respect you might've had for anyone involved in making the series.\\n\\n\r\nLucky Star's art is sickeningly sweet moe-trash. For a studio that is clearly focused more on animation than story, the level of mediocrity shown here is unacceptable. At least when I watched that shitheap Haruhi Suzumiya I could compliment aspects where it was clear that an effort was made to produce a quality product---here, we have a prime example of the new-age, assembly style artwork that is plaguing modern anime. With our huge advantages in technology, one would think that the seemingly limitless possibilities would spark breathtaking results, and while we have seen glimpses of that (i.e. 2009's Summer Wars), most of what has prevailed in the industry has been streamlined, sterilized, and soulless.\\n\\n\r\nI do have to give the anime props in the sound department, however. The OP is probably the most engaging part of the entire show, as each time you hear it you will be pumped for what has to be the episode where the series starts to pick up. Although it never does, I can't fault the OP for giving us hope. The various EDs run the gauntlet in terms of quality, but overall they're a nice break away from the mouth breathing dynamics that are the actual show. As for the voice actors, they all came and turned out respectable performances, giving the show at least one bearable quality in between credits. This is one of the few anime that I watched subbed however, so I have no idea if the American VAs are any good.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that people say they can relate to characters on this show is frightening. They literally amount to little moeballs stuffed with every possible high-school girl cliche the writers could dig up, and never develop past that point. Konata, however, is not only that, but something much, much worse. While the rest of the characters seek to appeal to the section of the anime market that fawns over overt cuteness, Konata is an interesting look at how far an animation studio will go to squeeze money out of otaku fucks. She was created solely so weeaboos would have someone on the cast they could identify with, and keeping in tune with Kyoto Animation's opinion of their viewers, she's painfully one-dimensional. Her hobbies include video games, anime, and being a bitch. That's it. Unfortunately, not much else can be said about the rest of their characters either. Miyuki is the intellect of the group, but she's also moe. Tsukasa is the shy one, but she's also moe. Kagami is the fiery tsundere, but she's also moe. At the very least, when you give a one line description of Seinfeld's characters, you're leaving out a lot of character information. They may not really change as time progresses, but you certainly learn a lot more about them. In Lucky Star, one line descriptions define our characters for the entire show. There's more character development on an episode of Cops than there is here.\\n\\n\r\nAs I reached the end of the final episode, I turned to my therapist who was, at that current moment, sobbing into my shoulder due to sheer, unfettered boredom. His bloodshot eyes looked up at me and as I looked down at him with a mix of pity and remorse, I could see his lips faintly whisper out \"save me\". As the girls geared up their cheerleading performance of the opening song, I could see his last glimmer of hope, of faith in humanity, slip away from him and float towards the abyss.\\n\\n\r\nHe thought he could save me.\\n\\n\r\nI refuse to believe that Kyoto Animation could, as they watched over the series for the last time before officially releasing it, say with complete honesty that this series was not only acceptable for public consumption but also legitimately enjoyable. It's possible to relish in a show's badness if you're able to respect the sincerity of the people that made it. It's why I love movies like The Room and Batman and Robin, and it's why I think Mars of Destruction deserves to be shown nightly on HBO. However, when something this bad is actually just a cruel joke at the expense of a bunch of weeaboo faggots, the insincerity of it all taints what could've just been a run of the mill bad show and turns it into something mean-spirited and unlikeable. I don't think otaku realize that this show isn't actually celebrating the things they love, it's passive-aggressively making fun of them and their interests, and they're actually paying to have it happen to them in real time. Has this community sunk so low that even the people making this shit can get away with calling you all fucking losers? At what point will you stop yelling \"FEED ME MORE MOE GIRLS\" and start clamoring for real, quality entertainment? Don't you want to know what it feels like to laugh without having to force it out?\\n\\n\r\nWhat's that? K-ON!!'s on? Sorry, I'll come back when you're finished.",

A more appropriate and less obscure name would be \"Killing yourself with boredom\".\r\nJust want a moment to say this. OVERRATED. You could watch the first few minutes of Lucky Star or you could repeatedly hit yourself on the head with a brick. The effect is surprisingly similar.\r\nI wasnt sure on what to do with this anime. Was it supposed to be funny? How? I cant find one thing about it funny! Am I supposed to enjoy how Im able to relate to them? \"Hey dude,that fictional, animated girl on the T.V just farted, so did I!&quot; Well I'll be damn.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is just screaming out the word boredom. Who on earth would want to watch schoolgirls talk about the different ways to cut food for five friggin minutes? Surprisingly, millions of em. Even after contemplating for a long period of time, I can not fathom why anyone would want to watch this. To be honest, I dont go for slice of life anime's but I am assured that this is an insult to slice of life anime's everywhere. We deserve better than this piece of ****.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and the voice acting is the only saving grace here. The rest are piss. The characters are shallow, comedy is not comedic, and lets not forget about how blunt the story is.\\n\\n\r\nSchool Rumble has nothing to fear from this destitute, brain-numbing show.\\n\r\nIf I were you I would rather take a brick, apply it to my forehead with force: Trust me, it&rsquo;ll hurt less than trying to make sense of this anime.",

            "content": "Erm...So i have now re-watched it for second time...This is my first time doing something like that. Raki \u2606 Suta! \r\nStory: Most common mistake people make is that they say Lucky Star doesn't have a story. It has! \"The daily lives of 4 high school girls.\" Understood? Good. Can't say much here, because of the randomness of \"slice of life\" genre. Still, I like how the story progress, except for the first few episodes which people usually don't understand what the series is about - which is director's fault. *shrugs* He got fired after the first four episodes anyway. If you think this story isbad, wait 'till you see Mars of Destruction.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: Yeah, I know that the art is nothing compared to KyoAni's usual productions, but is far better than them in one aspect, cuteness. Anyone who have watched the series can tell that how cute Konata is. Most of the scenes aren't really detailed, you usually see the upper parts of the characters, but that doesn't change how well cuteness goes with Miyuki's 'ultimade moe-ness', Konata's children-like personality and Tsukasa's 'little sister-ish' figure. BTW, background is detailed, proof (was) here, now destroyed with the absence of BBCodes.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: This one varies a lot, depending on how many animes you've seen. The OP is catchy, and goes with the cuteness of the anime. The different endings were a good addition to anime, but if you haven't heard the songs before, you may think that a single ending theme would be better. And for the second part of the EDs, Shiraishi Minoru does awesome job. You still may not know some of the songs sung by him, but just watching him is entertaining too. I love how KyoAni toys with their own songs. The sound effects and OST isn't really obvious, but I can say that how it goes with the flow and is \"cute\" really enhances the dialogues. Especially when Kona-chan is about to start saying a funny comment about Kagami, the way music stops right before it and you can guess it coming.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Probably you can't learn their personalities in just one episode, but as the time goes on, you learn more and more about their personality. Even in the second half of the anime where they introduce new characters, no character gets more screentime than another. If they do, well, KyoAni is sure to make a joke about them! They are so unique and easy to remember. OK, not really unique (Kagami as you typical tsundere and Miyuki as you typical moe) but they are unique in their own ways. No wait! According to Shiraishi, Kagami isn't tsundere! Oh well, I don't care about what he thinks. Kagami is tsundere. \\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: What can someone give this part anything besides 10 out of 10? Great jokes, mainly based Suzumiya Haruhi and everyday problems of the world and Japan. Again, if you haven't watched Haruhi yet, you won't be able to get even the half of the jokes. That said, if you have watched it, you'll probably love the jokes. Azumanga Daioh is pretty much the same as Lucky Star, both having jokes based on pure randomness. School Rumble is more romance oriented, but still on par with them. If I had to pick one of them, it'd definitely be Lucky Star.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This series is a definitely a must-see for someone who has some anime knowledge and interested in slice of life/comedy genre. Lucky Star is a win or lose situation. Either you hate it, or you love it. If you like it, it will probably certainly be one of your favourite animes. If you don't like the slice of life/comedy genre and don't have fun finding all those references, I suggest that you don't watch it. Be sure to watch Haruhi beforehand, if you are going to watch Lucky Star.\\n\r\n10/10",

            "content": "I may be considered as a Lucky Star hater. The previous sentence is for people who click the \"Not Helpful\" button just because they disagree with the review instead of how well constructed the review is; I do not wish to waste their precious time as inhumane and insensitive beings to destroy other people's lives as reviewers. Even if I do talk about the good aspects of the work that I enjoyed, I expect about 10 of 1,500 people to find this review helpful so Lucky Star fans, make me proud. To everyone else considering this show and reading reviews because of how well-constructed theyare, I implore you to continue reading.\\n\\n\r\nI am a big fan of slice-of-life shows. It is a genre that plays with the mundaneness of life and family; there is very little concrete story and shows tend to be driven either by comedy, moe, or relationship dynamics. Lucky Star is not a slice-of-life show, but a show that panders to otakus with a considerable amount of fanservice and random anime references that makes Family Guy cry in his bed and call for mommy. I do not wish to call such works terrible just because they do that; Pani Poni Dash does this as well and it's way funner to watch even if you don't get all the references because it feels like a sitcom. Lucky Star is not a sitcom.\\n\\n\r\nThe show itself is inconsistent. Episode 1 is infamous because it is plain boring. In the Studio Shaft anime, Sayonara, Zetsubou Sensei, the characters criticized episode 1's coronet scene for just being plain boring. Episode 1 is almost unwatchable. It makes FLCL's quotable line, \"Nothing amazing happens here. Everything is ordinary.\", feel so true with the anime medium. People who plan to watch this show should note the actual work only starts at about episode 2.\\n\\n\r\nOther episodes involve the \"cute girls doing cute things\" mantra. I'm pretty cool with this -- as I said, I'm a big fan of slice-of-life works --; however, the main character cast is almost a letdown from the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nKonata, played by Aya Hirano, references to Haruhi and other famous shows from the past. If you know Hokuto no Ken/Fist of the North Star and Initial D, then you are in luck. Most people don't; however, this show can still be watched without knowing the references. It's just that you'll be missing 80% of the show's \"appeal\", unlike Pani Poni Dash's which only amounts about 40%.\\n\\n\r\nKagami is a tsundere who plays the straight man role. Tsukasa is moe and clumsy. Miyuki is moe and smart because she has glasses. If we judge them by character models, I think they're all pretty cute. As characters, they are terrible, bland, and boring. They don't offer a lot of interesting dynamics and they just feel flat as characters. Miyuki is one of the worst flat characters, changing very little throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nOther episodes fared better with the addition of supporting characters. I enjoyed the supporting characters more than the main cast. Konata's dad, Izumi, is a perverted man who enjoys taking pictures of little girls and often asks his daughter to find the flag to get into the h-scene in eroges. Anime Tenchou is one of the most memorable characters and his over-the-top antics leave something to desire in the show itself. Akira Kogami's and Minoru Shiraishi's dynamics are just fun to look at; I look forward to their Lucky Channel segment a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThere is an episode that I remember being actually good. It's about Konata's mother. To me, that's actually pretty good slice-of-life drama. Why the show doesn't follow this formula of success and go into moe pandering confuses me.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I am negative about the characters, the modeling as I said are great. The puni plush style is gorgeous and the backgrounds, as expected from KyoAni, are beautiful and photorealistic. If I view this as an art piece, it might get a B+ from me.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is one of those catchy atrocious tunes; the lyrics make little sense at all. Animation in the OP is pretty dynamic and wacky, unlike the show itself. I'm more of a \"meh\" when it comes to the OP.\\n\\n\r\nTo call the show polarizing is an understatement; it's either a show that you love or hate. I am clearly at the \"hate\" part, but I see some good aspects of the work. However, there are too many problems that causes me to dislike and hate the work. I admit that this work is influential, but for the wrong reasons. People should not just watch for the work's influence, but whether they enjoyed it or not. That's how you rate and review a work.",

I watched the first episode today (6th of July), but I have to say that it's maybe the most annoying, boring and useless anime my poor eyes have ever seen. This anime is simply horrid.\r\nIt made me sick after 5 minutes (opening theme included), and I've dropped it at the first episode. It actually never happened to me before. I guess there's a first time for everything.\r\nThe OP, its lyrics, the characters, the dialogues, everything is just too stupid to bear. Even a decent (if youdare to call a moeblob thing decent) art is completely useless with an anime like Lucky Star.\\n\\n\r\nAfter only 1 episode, I felt like some of my precious neurons died, so I've stopped quickly.\\n\r\nA whole episode talking about how to eat food (more specifically, a chocolate cornet)? Now if you excuse me...\\n\r\n1) I already know how to eat, since I'm not retarded like Konata.\\n\r\n2) I have many better things to do.\\n\r\n3) I prefer sushi.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no character development. At all.\\n\r\nThe whole episode is absurdly boring.\\n\r\nMore than slice of life, it's a slice of cake.\\n\r\nAnd, the worst thing is, it's supposed to be a comedy, and it's not funny. Not in the slightest bit.\\n\r\nIs Lucky Star supposed to make you cry from laughing? Yes, you'll cry, but only due to extreme boredom from watching this pathetic anime.\\n\\n\r\nEverything would be better than watch stupid 17yo girls (who look like 8yo to please the lolicon audience) that do nothing except talking, and talking, and talking in an awfully annoying and inconclusive way about the most superficial topics ever heard. I've had way more fun with watching my cat sleeping.\\n\\n\r\nLucky Star is the umpteenth anime that proves how the masses are blind towards the quality of an anime and how they always follow the cute (?), frivolous, random fashion that is currently on the top of the list.\\n\r\nAn advice for you guys: go watch a REAL anime. Don't waste your precious time with this retarded moeblob KyoAni parade. Want an actual funny anime? Watch Excel Saga. Watch Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. Watch Shin-chan. Watch everything but Lucky Star.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, I know everyone's going to hate my review and hope I'll burn in hell for writing this about the best anime ever made (...yes...sure...).",

The pain, I couldn't stand it. Nevertheless, I tried to watch it and see if I could find something interesting but sadly I couldn't\r\nStory: Pretty poor indeed, because there isn't a plot. The anime only talks about the life of 4 high school girls... 5 later. There isn't anything else, otherthan talking about their usual lifes, food, animes, videogames, etc. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art was fine, I really liked the colors and how beautiful it looked but sometimes the art was bad in other parts. All I can say is that sometimes it looked great and sometimes it looked bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The seiyuus were great, especially Konata and Kagami but sometimes some voices ruined the mood like almost all the sales clerk that appeared because almost all of them had the same seiyuu and that ruined it. The opening to be honest was pretty bad; the music was kind of bad and the endings... the only one I liked was when Konata sang Chala Head Chala but the other ones were bad, especially when they started to put real actors in the ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Hardly, there isn't a development there. The only thing that can be rescued is the fact of the interaction between Konata and Kagami but after all everything is dull. Let's put it this way; Konata is your typical otaku, Kagami the tsundere, Tsukasa the shy girl and Miyuki the one that is the intelligent. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, pretty bad. The anime is supposed to make you laugh or relate yourself to one of the character; I couldn't do that. The jokes and things that happen didn't amuse me at all and the characters the only one I could relate a little was Konata because she like me loves videogames and animes but that is all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This anime isn't for anyone. If you like anime with plot and character development then get away from here, you will never like Lucky Star. The anime itself isn't bad but as I said, it isn't for everyone. Some people might like it and enjoy the characters and the jokes that I couldn't get but for me, this anime is quite overrated; not even all the references of Haruhi could save it.",

            "content": "What happens when you combine my favorite genre (Slice of Life) with my favorite studio (Kyoto Animation)? You get Lucky Star.\r\nStory: Normally when I score story in a Slice of Life show, I do it based on all the episodic stories combined. But what happens when a show does not have that and is just pure life and is random with no coherent order/story. That is why I left the score a blank. \r\nBut I would still like to talk about the content. Lucky Star plays off its humor through normal everyday conversations. Talking about the most random things and finding humor out of itis tricky. Personally, I found most conversations hilarious because I enjoy the idea of everyday situations being made fun at. This type of humor is not for everybody and thus why this show can be a hit or miss.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect of this show is its use of references. A good amount of conversations play off such references. And they can go anywhere from other anime to current events. It went as far as to use an old commercial. One of the keys to be able to enjoy this anime is to be able to know the references. Watching as much anime as I do, I got most of them easily.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: Technically speaking, this is not KyoAni's best work. But the style and design works really well for this type of story. There are times where I felt that they were being very lazy and yet there were times I was marveled at the level of detail. Of course it is nowhere near the level of their other works such as Haruhi.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Voice - Everyone plays there roles really well. I was  particularly impressed with Hirano Aya (voice of Konata). KyoAni really utilized her vocal range and made great situations out of it. \\n\\n\r\n            Music - To me, this is probably the weakest aspect of the show. The OP is indeed catchy but it can only be appealing for so long. And the &quot;different&quot; ED each week was a hit or miss. The only great part about it was the appearance of Minoru Shiraishi. Having him sing for the last part of the series was brilliant. Listening to him was a blast. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Perhaps the strongest aspect of the show. The cast of Lucky Star are great. The variety it has and the way they fit so well together really bring out the show. Whether you come to like this show or not, I believe there will be at least one character that you can't help but like. Rather than me telling you, I hope you go check out this show after reading this review and see for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment = My score on MAL (it is subjectively rated)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a very enjoyable show. But it is for those who are into those kinds of humor. It is not something I would recommend to everybody. I believe this show is one of those shows where it is a hit or miss.",

            "content": "Overrated is the word that best describes Lucky Star. The animation is terrible for 2007 and the story is slice of life to the extreme; in other words boring. It's either a love it or hate it anime, but how can one like such a stale story line? \r\nThe animation/art is very lazy and the lines are jagged. Kyoto Animation has up to date animation but \"Lucky Star\" looked like there wasn't effort put in. The people in the background are usually grey keyholes, and sometimes have faces but aren't animated. The characters are, yes, in high school despite looking like they are eight. Thepalette is extremely pastel while the colours almost blend together. The only time the animation was astounding was in snippets of video games/manga/anime etc.. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are cliche and aren't developed. There's the perfectionist who gets high marks and is very Type A. There is the shy, clumsy girl who likes to cook. There is the glasses girl who is well mannered. And, the lazy girl who plays video games doesn't put effort into homework but gets above average marks. Stereotypical characters. The design on three of them are cute, but if one is looking for cute characters in anime he or she should watch anything by CLAMP (Card Captor Sakura, Chobits) or the queen of kawaii, Koge Donbo. (Di Gi Charat, Pita Ten) There needs to be substance to cute characters and CLAMP and Koge Donbo proves it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story, as mentioned before, is very plotless. Napolean Dynamite may have proven stories without a plot can be entertaining, but Lucky Star doesn't prove that theory. The first episode the characters are taking about how to eat food. First episodes usually aren't the greatest in the series, but when the writers start off with a boring story one can get a clear picture of how the lack of plot is present in this anime. Also, first episodes are meant to encourage viewers to keep watching not bore them. Usually scenes to shows are no more than two minutes to keep things moving, but &quot;Lucky Star&quot; is at a snail's pace. It's episodic (each episode is different and not chronologically) which suited the show and added to Anime since most is thematic. (Each episode is connected) and  There are some jokes thrown in here and there as well as cameos to other anime/video games, but it doesn't save the storyline. \\n\\n\r\nThe random dancing in the opening is the only thing good about this anime.  If the show were to be animated well the random dance would have been more enjoyable. The opening music killed the amusing random dancing. It sounded more like owl's hooting a rap but inhaled too much helium. Though, there is a middle part (the only real singing) that is interesting. \\n\\n\r\nThe actors suited their roles and fit their personalities. They even hired the same actress who did Haruhi in The Melconcholy of Haruhi Suzumiya as one of the characters, which fit the Haruhi cameo. They had high pitched cartoony voices for the appropriate roles which suited the show. \\n\\n\r\nYou must count your lucky stars while watching this anime in order to enjoy this anime.  It's slice of life to the point where it's boring and leads nowhere. Watch the second episode (as mentioned the first is a disaster) to see if it amusing, which it isn&rsquo;t. Lucky Star doesn't offer anything to the table and can be easily passed to save one minutes of being wasted watching this anime. It may have gotten better but who wants to waste 10 episodes to get to the good stuff?\\n\\n",

            "content": "I found this anime very difficult to get through. The comedy wasnt exactly funny, and the jokes and puns were more like \r\n\"oh, i relate/understand that, is my life also considered sad?\"\r\nusing the rating breakdown, let me explain to you why I didnt find this anime particularly wonderful.\r\nSTORY: there was almost no storyline. Sure 4 girls are trying to get through high school. but that sums up every other anime out there, about kids at school. What this anime lacked was drive. Plot is one of the elements which create the drive, but there was none. Im giving the story a 5 just for thesake of the somewhat cleverly placed jokes. As well, many of the elements got tiring and old, such as Lucky Channel, which is a talkshow hosted at the end of each episode. The live action scenes at the end of the latter episodes also got extremely annoying and exploited.\\n\\n\r\nART: nothing spectacular. I understand that for this kind of show, beautiful art isnt exactly the most neccessary thing. However, a lot of the time, there was no background. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: sadly, there was hardly any background music. But the sole reason that I rated the sound so much higher than the other qualities is because the OP was just so amazing and addictive. Sadly, the energy and excitement of the OP could not be reflected into the show.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: The characters presented are all very different, and their interactions with each other are very amusing to watch. I would have liked if there was at least some character development, or at least some insight into the characters. Often, characters also give an anime series the drive it needs to go on, but there was nothing about the characters that made you want to know more about them.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: I must say that the enjoyment factor, for me, especially, was quite low compared to many other people. This show was extremely hyped, and many many people were saying how amazing it was, and how funny it was. When I watched, I was extremely dissapointed. I even sat the series through to the end to see if I was missing something, or if the &quot;amazingness&quot; came later on. it didnt. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the anime I enjoy watching has some substance, and there are factors like plot and characters that make me want to keep watching it. Lucky Star didnt cut it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you also prefer animes with more substance, themes, plot, and character, I do not recommend Lucky Star.",

            "content": "I've gotta hand it to you Lucky Star haters, you cease to amaze me. No, I'm not some illogical retard who loves Twilight or crap like that, I'm pretty much one who has logic, in all seriousness I love logic. When you see me posting illogical stuff and me not admitting it, then I was either a) trolling or b) being drunk (I tend to lose myself when it's really late or really early in the morning but not drink beer drunk).\r\nI wanted to write this review because I was just overwhelmed seeing people who hate Lucky Star just because of their whorish fans. Iknow some of your friends keep bitching to you how epic win Lucky Star is and that you MUST, NO MATTER WHAT MUST like Lucky Star but hey I won't force you, I'm just here to tell you,\"NOT ALL LUCKY STAR FANS ARE RETARDS, HENCE STOP STEREOTYPING US.\" That's all.\\n\\n\r\nNow I won't go in the real scoring method (other than for the review itself) of discussing stuff one-by-one but rather, I'll try to argue with the haters' views, call this review some kind of liaison for those of you haven't watched and those who have, loving it or hating it, I assure you I won't get biased.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's get to the most criticized part that I think is getting RIDICULOUS amounts of criticism: THE PLOT. Alright, how many slice-of-life anime shows have no plot? Seriously, a criticism you come up with IT HAS NO STORY LAWL! I'm not trying to offend you, not at all (and I swear I'm not being sarcastic) but that's ridiculous. I've seen lots of anime shows with no plot and I still liked it. Plot or no plot, it's EXECUTION that matters. A game with excellent plot but poor gameplay would probably result in the gamer only finishing it once and not ever again just because of the plot (considering that the gamer likes storylines that is) but a game with poor plot but excellent gameplay would be re-played numerous times like what I do with Devil May Cry 3.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, if this were not a haters-vs-lovers review I'm making, I would rate the plot as -/10 because it's almost non-existent (aside from daily lives) and usually I won't even judge the plot of animes which don't have any solid plot in the first place. What the hell is useful in judging something that's not there? Shows can concentrate on many points: some concentrate on action (hence, art and maybe storyline), some can go on plot stuff (hence, THE PLOT) and some can go for humour (hence, execution) or even slice of life (which is usually based on how well you can relate to it). If you fail to get the premise of my words in this paragraph, you fail it and I'll say to you,\"Go away, you're not worth reading this thing.\"\\n\\n\r\nIt's simple logic really. But to be fair, since these types of Anime (about daily lives of people) are usually just that (aside from some Animes like Honey & Clover which explores far deeper into their lives, making even more sub-plots) I'll give it a 6.5/10 in the review, rounded off to 7. They should have some kind of decimal rating stuff here =_=\\n\\n\r\nAlso, since it's similar to a sitcom where you start off here and end at the same place you started, some may dislike it but I don't really mind. I just feel that instant liking to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThen the art, yeah people have different opinions. I can't say much. It's really love-it-or-hate-it kind of thing so I won't criticize either side for their respective views on this, although I realize that it's purposely acting cute and aiming to be highly-loli-like for teh lulz, some people just won't take this crap >_>\\n\\n\r\nI like the moe and cute art so I give it an 8 here. Yeah call me biased and loli, I won't care when illogical people call on me for no reason at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds, ALSO love-it-or-hate-it. I actually liked the OP song and ED stuff that were sing by Minoru Shiraishi (especially ep 13, 17 and 22) and the soundtrack sounds quite nice. It fits in with the flow and the atmosphere, which is hands-down relaxing. It's a no-brainer that there won't be any epic soundtracks coming from here. I also like the soft OP that was transitioned into an instrumental at Ep 24. If you'd like to compare this anime's OST to, say.. being fair in the slice-of-life genre, Honey & Clover, after some consideration, is comparing a more variety-rich soundtrack in melancholy and whacky pieces (H&C) with a more cheerful and light-toned soundtrack suited for a happy life (LS). I give it an 8. It's excellent at its very best which I more or less expected with its soothing soft music and some great ones. I'd actually recommend you getting this if it weren't for those 10+ BGM CD's that you'd have to get to get them all. Troublesome really, most soundtracks are in 1 CD but this is different =_= feels like they're cashing in or something. With Minoru Shiraishi and the different Character songs, I give this probably 8.4 after more exploration. I couldn't give this an 8.5 or else I'll be rounding off to a 9.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend the whole BGM soundtrack to be honest and maybe 100% nai nai nai on Kagami's Character song. Maybe it's just my taste but I honestly think it's one of the better than most other songs there. Again, people's tastes differ in art so nothing to talk abou here.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuu wasn't all that bad but with so many people having lots of different preferences I can't criticize this point much. Like people say, different people have different opinions, or as one of the anime title say,\"10 people, 10 colours\" which means different people, different minds. I'd like to give the seiyuu a 8 though, seems like the main cast's voice fits too perfects and I feel I sense laziness from some departments but then it's not really annoying or really for the comedy (e.g, most of the extras sound exactly the same).\\n\\n\r\nOnto the characters, I can see how people can dislike Tsukasa, Miyuki and the other side characters but it kinda strikes me how people seem to think that we love Konata simply because she's loli + otaku thus loli otaku thus INSTA-WIN! Or some sort. I, for one, simply love Konata because I actually am like her. I love to procrastinate (but it's slowly going away :D), I love games to death (up to the point that I don't sleep for 31 hours), I love anime too. The similarities make me relate to her in so many ways and being a younger brother, it was interesting to see how she felt being like an older sister, maybe I've never really seen that in my brother before.\\n\\n\r\nNot sure how people hate Konata. Probably they hate her just because other Lucky Star fans who are whores (there are people like these the same way there are Twitards [Twilight Retards]) keep persisting and bitching that she's the best character in the world. Whatever, if you're a hater, here's an advice: they're idiots, don't listen to them. AT ALL.\\n\\n\r\nKagami is your typical tsundere but less of the slapstick tsuntsun or stuff like Louise or Taiga who are world-famous tsundere champs. Honestly I find her character great. She's the responsible type, hell if I will, she's Tohsaka Rin a la Lucky Star. She just socializes more with these friends than Tohsaka Rin from FSN does and honestly Kagami teases people less than what Tohsaka does and is more open than she is (sadly, if you don't know her, then you could ask around, she's like a common house-hold name in Anime these days >_>). One of her main attractive features is probably her looks, her hairstyle and her behaviour + chemistry with Konata.\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa, Kagami's younger sister is your typical moe, shy, cutesy-cute character who's the pinnacle of air-heads in Lucky Star. Yeah I can still see how people hate her. Air-heads like these are sometimes boring characters and honestly, I never truly loved her the way I loved Kagami and Konata so yeah.\\n\\n\r\nMiyuki though, I can get why people dislike her, again. She's the glasses girl - silent, not too out-going, caring, helpful, wears glasses, is clumsy - and the usual smart type. Over-used stereotype, I know so I won't be bashing either side for loving or hating it although so far I think I've only criticized a hater. Tell me where I'm wrong and I'd love to ask you some stuff and for you to ask me some stuff so I can see why people hate this so much.\\n\\n\r\nI believe people hated ep 1 - 4 because their director was changed after ep 4 and it got a whole lot better in my opinion so I invite everyone who's just started on the series or have not started the series to watch till like episode 6 to 8 and after that episode I won't force you to watch anymore if you still dislike it since it's either a) it's not your thing or b) it's not your thing. I'm not some whore who won't take the fact that people can dislike what I love.\\n\\n\r\nThen the conversations, although shallow, I can relate too. I've wondered about many things that even this anime has covered and I love this feeling. I've also talked with some people about stuff Konata and co. have too. Also different situations like opening a bag of chips for someone, blocking the straw opening so that the water sticks there and acting all immature and pointing to how cool it is (actually I went as far as going to my science teacher to ask about this, but that was lots of years ago), how I pull an all-nighter right before a test, etc and etc.\\n\\n\r\nThe humour is also dependent on how your humour goes. If you're into the references and the soft humour stuff then Lucky Star is great but honestly, I find this series as a whole not that incredibly funny or Hayate no Gotoku!-like in anyway. It's pretty unfair comparing them in my opinion but hey it's MY opinion so who gives a shit right? It isn't YOURS so I'm not bashing YOUR opinion unless you have a crooked and baseless opinion which I've seen from the Anti-Lucky Star club who I'd love to discuss with why they hate the series WITHOUT flaming or anything of the sort. I've seen in their thread, some people posting that the show has no plot (explained), sucky art, sound and characters (explained) and their friends keep whoring on them and say it's the best show and if you don't like it = u fail. Well I'm here to tell you, just like a motivator like Adam Khoo or Tucker Max or some sort of motivator guy, say \"NO U!\" to THEM!\\n\\n\r\nI've got a friend who doesn't like the types of genre I like but I don't go around her and keep choking her to death yelling,\"WATCH THIS OR I'LL KILL YOUR KITTENS AND HAUNT UR CHILDREN!!!!!\" or shit like that, honestly, if you have friends like that, then you should consider first, if your friends are SMART people or IDIOTS, which I think majority are. If they can't even get people have different opinions (autism aside), then they are complete fuck-ups, idiots, failure to logic, immature, etc etc etc etc etc.\\n\\n\r\nNever listen to what other people like those say. Honestly, I actually follow some hypes (e.g Shakugan no Shana, Lucky Star, Zero no Tsukaima) my friends give me but after that I rely on MY OWN opinion, not theirs and my opinions are made from a base and that base is solid. Rarely is the base of my opinions a crooked one and if it is I'll freely admit it or if I'm feeling like an asshole, I'll change ID and register a new user (heheh :P that was like years ago though).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed the series and I don't care what YOU think. If you find this review helpful, then thank you very much, if you don't, then I don't blame you and I won't be cursing your name a million times, it's up to you. God I don't get why people care so much what other people think sometimes. You've got opinions, I've got mine and sometimes people just have crooked opinions and that's why I wrote this.\\n\\n\r\nI really don't find the point in criticizing an Anime that has no plot as a shallow anime that has no plot as if pointing out that those white lab rats don't have tails compared to normal rats which have tails thus the lab rat is a bad rat and thus we must burn in into the haet-oven.\\n\\n\r\nSo, whatever the hype, don't trust it for this anime or you may get utterly disappointed. I followed the hype and I got what I wanted (well after ep 1 I was disappointed but things got better afterwards). If you hate it and you don't want to be convinced, then I don't care. If you hate it and want some discussions on why it's so damn popular, please do talk with me on the forums or any other place. If you love it, then so do I! Yeah all in all I give this anime a 9/10 for me but in general, for all of you, it's probably a 7.8 on average\\n\\n\r\nAlthough in my opinion Honey & Clover runs deeper, into the more confused melancholy adolescent and that people may call 'pathetic' and 'emo' and 'self-loathing' (irks me that they never ever felt down THAT much before in their lives, guess people have it luckier) and maybe even philosophical stuff, Lucky Star does not go that far and does not fail to deliver simple everyday things or zanier things but still make it interesting.\\n\\n\r\nTo haters: simply put, any slice-of-life anime does not depend on plot. They depend on their characters and how much you can relate to them. OP does not matter, ED does not matter, what matters is how much you can relate to them and don't let any fangirls get the better of you and make you hate it. I've always been trolled with Naruto by my friends but I shrug it off, who cares really? Honestly, my point is if you can't relate to it, then you won't like it. That's my view of what slice-of-life animes really should be like. Why do I love t? I truly love the Konata and Kagami's personalitie and chemistry. I can relate to Konata and Kagami the most too. I don't express myself that well and yet I'm very much a Konata without the-- oh wait maybe I do act lazy. Really, to be honest, if you watch it from episode 6 and skip 1 - 5 you probably won't be lost anyway. P.S I AM NO LOLICON - I don't love them for their loliness thank you very much. Who ever said we love loli anyway >_>\\n\\n\r\nSide note: I love Shiraishi Medley and Orewa suremono :D",

But on my opinion i think this anime is as boring asd you can get. The sound is ok really cute and funny, that i can't complain, but the art.. some people say its cute and simple, i say its way too simple and not that cute to be honest, i've seen much cutter characters such as chibis and so. The storyline.. I really think thats the worst part in it, i firsts started seeing this anime because it was kinda cute, i wastold that Konata was exactly like me, so i went to see it, very amusing at first, but as it goes on.. it turns to be a REAL drag.. Its basicly always the same, school, home, shoping, konata bein all about videogames, anime and manga, kagami arguing with konata, tsukasa stating the obvious with konata and miyuki being the smart girl there.\\n\r\nIts basicly nothing new, always the same in each episode, and to be honest, the anim aint really that funny.. It rarely makes me laugh, and its not that i have no sense of humor or that i never did those experiences! I do have sence of humor and i had most of those experiences. But seriously i don't see whats funny about it, but that my opinion anyways, of course we all dont share the same opinion and i respect otherts opinions. But this is how i see things, and i reall. i dont think this anime is worth the ranking it has..\\n\\n\r\nEven a friend of mine that loves cute animes and such, like Shugo chara and Suzumiya Haruhi, she started seeing lucky star and enjoyed it, but has she went on she just said: Man you were right.. ._. that anime is cute and all but its making me so bored, ill see it later when i have the guts ^^'\\n\\n\r\nOne more person saying the same as i.\\n\\n\r\nI think the only good aspects about the anime are the sound and the characters, like you all say, gotta love Konata X)\\n\\n\r\nAnyways this is just my opinion! Don't blame me im not a lucky star hater >.",

            "content": "Lucky * Star is about highschool girls and.. ummm, well, that's about it. It basically revolves around the lives of four girls (later on, more people are given some time) and the random conversations they have.\r\nStory \r\nThis series is not incredibly plot filled. Actually, there really is none. It's not even really character driven. This anime, however, doesn't need much of a story. It still works out in a cute way. However, the rating IS for story, and in all fairness, there really was none. I think this is a fair, if not quite high rating for what was presented.\r\nAnimation \r\nThe best animation is definitlyin the opening sequence. Everything flows nicely in it, and it throws money around to give a flawless performance. Once you get to the actual show, however, there is basically no movement what so ever, save the talking. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style isn't top notch. It is kept with the original 4-koma's style, but I still think they could have coloured it a bit better. Maybe make the girls atleast look more their age.\\n\\n\r\nSound \\n\r\nI did really like that opening song. Quite catchy. The in-show music was also fairly well done, aside from the fact that I didn't really notice it. The music just kind of melted into the background. That's the only reason why it's not higher on my rating. It was good, but nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter \\n\r\nThis was my biggest issue. The series had INCREDIBLY 2-dimensional characters. They did not develope, they did not change. We did no see any different sides to them. The closest to this was with Konata, and... whatever her name is. The older of the twins. \\n\\n\r\nThis may have been alright, because this would seriously screw up the nature of the anime, but because of the 2-D element to them, I couldn't really connect to any of them. Except maybe Konata. I'm a big nerd too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \\n\r\nWhile I did have a few giggles, I did not either really like this series, or really dislike it. I can see why people like it, but I don't understand the overwhelming popularity. I was told it was funny, but it wasn't a comedy. It was slice-of-life. I was told it was meaningful. That was a load of bull. I watched the series with no expectations, and I ended it with none. I don't see myself rewatching this anytime soon.\\n\\n\r\nOverall / My Comments / My Feelings \\n\r\nI know people will be angry, but it wasn't an overall amazing show. It has no story, the art was pretty boring, the sound disappeared, and the characters were 2-D. The only thing this series had that I liked was the otaku jokes. Other than that, I couldn't relate. Highschool isn't like this for me. Not at all. And I don't know people who are so stereotypical. I was a little disappointed, I think.\\n\\n\r\nI can't say anything but, sorry fans. I just couldn't get myself hooked. I atleast pulled through all the episodes, but it was becoming a little draining towards the end. I had no real drive to finish it...",

            "content": "Story: There isn't really a main story, the series revolves around the daily life of 4 high school girls.  This series is based on a Japanese 4-panel comic strip, and as comic strips go, the contents can be just about any topics that come to mind.  Though there's no main story (people gets judgmental about this), people overlook the fact it is BECAUSE there's no main story, there's no restrictions to what the series can talk about.\r\nArt: The art style from the anime were pretty much the same as from the manga.  There wasn't any inconsistencies and the animation was relatively smooththe entire time.  The characters/backgrounds were drawn the way they are because...again...this series is derived from a 4-panel comic strip.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The BGM blends with the episodes very well.  The opening song always got me pumped up to watch the episodes no matter what kind of mood I was in at the moment.  The ending songs were all taken from somewhere else and sung by the voice actors, and most of them were absolutely hilarious (especially Hare Hare Yukai sung by Shiraishi Minoru along with the 2 player fighting game training mode simulator).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: What's done so well about the character development is that you learn about the characters the same way you learn about someone in real life, from their casual conversations in school.  Even though this is a comedy, there are some dramatic scenes here and there showing some of the character's life at home.  There's also a wide variety of characters (who're normal and aren't golden haired, KI blasting, walking slabs of muscles) for the viewer to relate to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really like how this is a show that you can just pick up and enjoy without knowing the contents of the previous episodes.  There are also many references, so many that a normal person (who doesn't watch much anime or play games) wouldn't be able to understand more than half of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The thing about Lucky Star is that not everyone's going to like it.  This show is aimed towards regular anime watchers/gamers.  Those who are not anime watchers will be confused at the references, older people may think it's plotless insanity, and younger people may not understand the jokes.  \\n\\n\r\nWith that said, if you're an anime watcher (if you're taking time to read this I'd bet you are), this show will be an absolute blast.  This anime is the KING of referencing, and with each episodes being a synthesis of small events, you'll never guess what could happen next.\\n\\n\r\n**Brief Warning**\\n\r\nThe first few episodes of the series may seem boring at first, but they're for introducing the 4 main characters.  No matter what you may think, keep watching, give it a chance.  By episode 10 or so, you will not regret sticking with this series.",

            "content": "Lucky Star\r\nStory (6/10)\r\nThe story here was by far the hardest thing for me to rate. Being a comedy/slice-of-life type of thing, Lucky Star has no real \"plot-line\" or story. You could skip 5 episodes and still understand what was going on. However, the day-to-day goings and doings of the 4 main characters was done decently, and the variety of what they did was okay, so therefore I gave it a 6, which is fair/decent. \r\nOne thing I have to say though: After episode 10-ish or so, things were really getting boring. Sure, what they did was different, but the jokes had the same principle, andit was just all so boring and repetitive. Especially the stupid Lucky Channel. God, I skipped over that so many times. Because it was boring and... oh god. I can't even bring myself to go on. But since there isn't all that much plot, I can't sit here and elaborate on it forever, so moving on...\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nThough I don't like Kyoto Animation all that much, the good thing about them is the animation that they do is very good (though I personally don't like the style all that much). Everything flowed nicely and there was never a time where I thought &quot;Wow, they're running low on their budget&quot; or &quot;Wow, they got really lazy with that scene.&quot; But I'll be honest and say I really did not like the art style. The characters are supposed to be 17/18 and they looked like they were 10. Some people may call it cute and chibi but I call it ugly and stupid.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nAnother good thing about Lucky Star is the sound quality. Most notably the great job done by the seiyuu. Kudos to them for doing an excellent job. Other than that, the sound was nothing more and nothing less than decent. The BGM was fitting and non-annoying, the opening was cutesy and funny, but nothing special. The various endings were occasionally humorous but not a lot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10)\\n\r\nSince Lucky Star is a comedy, serious character development isn't exactly on its agenda. The characters were varied to some extent -- we have the various archetypes to fill, the tsundere, the moe blob, the smart/clumsy one, and the... otaku? However, this is as deep as the character gets. Saying you can relate to Konata because you also like anime/manga is like saying you can also relate to Miyuki because she is a high school student. There is no depth or development and the &quot;variety&quot; of characters only go as far as stereotypical archtypes that you can find in almost any other anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\\n\r\nSince the &quot;enjoyment&quot; part of the review is just a personal opinion, I don't let it affect my score. But needless to say, I did not enjoy Lucky Star. I can safely say I did not laugh once while watching this. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 is because despite Konata being a shallow character, I liked her for many reasons and it was almost some fun to watch her go about her daily otaku lifestyle among normal-ish friends. But a comedy without humor is like a cow with no spots. If you want to go laugh, watch Azumanga Daioh instead, a comedy with much more humor that you can't help but smile at. Lucky Star tried to bring us a cute and relaxing slice-of-life comedy and an otaku we can all relate to,  but in my opinion it utterly failed.",

            "content": "5 WORDS OR LESS REVIEW: Hysterically Funny\r\nI don&rsquo;t think I watched anything like Lucky Star before. I know people say it&rsquo;s a bit over hyped, or that it&rsquo;s nothing compared to Azumanga Daioh or Pani Poni Dash! but there is something to Lucky Star. That&rsquo;s why a lot of people, including me, like it. Let me enumerate on why I like it.\r\nI like the story. Sure there isn&rsquo;t much of a definite storyline, but that&rsquo;s what makes it easy to understand. Besides, it&rsquo;s a slice of life anime of four regular high school girls (well, maybe Konata&rsquo;s a little different) so you shouldn&rsquo;t expect anythingout of the ordinary. Even if it is like that, it still manages to entertain me and crack me up, and doing that with such little material is a hard task.\\n\\n\r\nI would say Lucky Star is very otaku oriented, as it makes fun of anime and otaku clich&eacute;s. Other than that, it makes use of a lot of spoofs and parodies to create comedy, which is a strength depending on how you look at it. It&rsquo;s a strength because it&rsquo;s great for full fledged otaku viewers, but it&rsquo;s a weakness if casual anime fans fans (those who don&rsquo;t watch anime on a regular basis, I suppose) try to watch it. They probably won&rsquo;t get the spoofs. Sure they can do some research on it, but I guess it wouldn&rsquo;t be as funny that way.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a huge part of the comedy, because they themselves are clich&eacute;s. Tsukasa is a moe character, while Miyuki is a meganekko. Kagami is a little tsundere, and of course, legendary girl A herself, Konata Izumi, is the rabid otaku. Out of all the girls, Konata has to be my favorite. I guess it&rsquo;s because I see myself in her. I guess there&rsquo;s a little Konata in every otaku out there. The extended cast is also hilarious, like Minoru Shiraishi and Akira of the Lucky Channel segment, as well as the characters&rsquo; relatives and their classmates.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Minoru Shiraishi, I have to say that Lucky Star did wonders for his career. I think he&rsquo;s more famous than before, and he&rsquo;s not even a main character. As for the other VAs, it&rsquo;s definitely a great cast. Two of my favorite VAs, Aya Hirano (Konata, of course) and Tomokazu Seki (Meito Anisawa) are in it, so that&rsquo;s one reason for me to be happy. Even the one episode extras are awesome Tomokazu Sugita and Daisuke Ono made cameo appearances for Lucky Star. You also gotta love Fumihiko Tachiki, who played all the random old woman characters throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nNow to discuss another popular rant. People are let down by the art style of Lucky Star, because it&rsquo;s so different from other KyoAni series (Kanon 2006, Air, etc). I see this as a positive. The characters are cuter that way, and being different is a good thing. Visually, Kanon 2006 and Air look great, but the character designs are a bit commonplace and standard. Lucky Star gives a breath of fresh air, that&rsquo;s what I like to think. The characters, colors, backgrounds &ndash; everything. Everything (visually) about Lucky Star is cute, another strength of Lucky Star.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also otaku oriented. For the first half, most of the songs are themes from actual anime. Aya Hirano&rsquo;s rendition of &ldquo;Cha-la Head Cha-la&rdquo; has to be one of my favorites from Lucky Star. I also like Minoru Shiraishi&rsquo;s rendition of &ldquo;Hare Hare Yukai&rdquo; and &ldquo;Motteke! Serafuku&rdquo;\\n\\n\r\nTo end this review, I think Lucky Star is a great anime. It certainly has its merits, and I understand why a lot of people like it. However, I understand that it&rsquo;s not perfect, and that it cannot please everybody.",

            "content": "Lucky Star is a Slice of Life, Comedy with no real plot; it just focuses on the daily lives of 4 school girls. It mainly pays attention to Konata Izumi, a very athelic girl who could be really smart, but she spends most of her time on anime, manga and playing games.\r\nThis great anime began with the slowest of starts that can easily turn anyone off, except of die-hard fans of anything produced by \"Kyoto Animation\", but after the first couple of lackluster episodes this anime becomes really enjoyable to watch. It's then when you really notice the differences in the characters' personalities and theway they interact. Lucky Star can be classed as a &quot;Satire&quot; because most of the time the characters mock various social issues that a lot of us viewers can relate to, &quot;like trying to find enough time for your anime and games&quot;. It's this that brings about hilarious parody moments however people who are new to the world of anime/manga/drama CD/games will feel left out, from not understanding the jokes. At least the &quot;Lucky Channel&quot; at the end of each episode is funny no matter what, with the hilarious duo that never seems to get along.\\n\\n\r\nThe style of animation in Lucky Star is very different from the stunning realism of &quot;Kyoto Animation's&quot; usual works, as Lucky Star adopts a very cartoony look. Nonetheless it works well bringing forth the weirdness of the character's personalities. The music on the other hand is basically non-existent and it's only the odd opening theme and various insert songs that can help redeem this factor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Lucky Star turned out to be a pretty enjoyable otaku fest but this anime is obviously not for everyone. Even though it's able to turn a simple topic into a hilarious episode full of parodies, each episode may be fun for someone yet not for someone else. I gave Lucky Star a high rating because I've seen many anime and can understand most of the jokes, so if you want the same experience then either watch many anime before starting this one or not bother watching it at all.\\n\r\n^_^",

Too bad that was one of the few things that I enjoyed about this one =P\r\nStory: 3\r\nOk, of course there isnt a story in this anime... it's Lucky Star for fark sakes. Well.. the story has a definite edge over Haruhi imo, follow Konata as she goes to school. Watch Konata eat a chocolate thing. HEY LOOK, Konata is playing games, lets watch. It's well put together for the most part, the story doesn't always completely go off on different tangents, but it really isn't all that interesting at the same time.\r\nArt: 10\r\nAs expected from thesame studio that brought us Haruhi, great visuals and very nice moods set by the animations. Not much else to say other than I enjoyed the art very thoroughly.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI enjoyed the soundtrack. It was a nice, cutesy pop-ish type of vibe, which I normally don't go for, but it sorta stuck here. The opening theme got annoying after awhile though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\r\nFor the most part, the character development was severely lacking, although one character that really shows some promise would be Kagami, very interesting personality shifts along the series, overall the most interesting character. The most entertaining character being Minoru Shiraishi (don't quote me on that spelling). But the rest were very linear, nothing really changed, it was the same thing in a different episode. Only slight differences.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nWell, there are a few instances in this anime where you just enjoy sitting through. Mostly the EXTREMELY abundant anime references. Haruhi references were VERY annoying, however. It's a slice of life type anime, there's no way you can't enjoy it a LITTLE bit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nGenerally, Lucky Star is an OK experience, one thing I wouldn't be able to do is go back and watch it all at once. Much too uneventful. This series really shouldn't have been 24 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nSorry Otakus. No 10 from me =P\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Other episodes remains the same style. Frankly Im really bored throughout the series but pushed myself to end this just soI can give least bias review. My first review in MAL.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening of Lucky star was good but the closing was the worse kind I ever saw. The ending song featured only to listen the song the anime's girl characters were singing. This remains the same till epi 14. Now the director or producer appears to entertain for their crap ending song. It is still lame however.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no story and was light and simple (different topic on every epi). In addition, its very short as there is a narrator speaking session at about the 18th minute. This session is also quite boring.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are one of the people easily find humor in 'slice of life' comedy and can enjoy text/talk type anime. This is for you.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is my honest opinion and review. I did not mean to anger anyone and I request respect for it.\\n\\n\r\nThx",

I have a different sense of humor and because of that not much of what they said was funny. And without laughs, what do you have? An incredibly boring show! Plus it didn't help that they tried to make Konata into a nerd's fantasygirl. It really just pissed me off.\\n\\n\r\nBut, with all that being said, it wasn't a horrible show.

            "content": "Wow. All I can say is, wow. I never, ever thought an anime with this much moe and no solid storyline would leave this kind of lasting impression on me. Lucky Star takes slice of life to a whole new level, possibly beyond any I've ever seen before. \r\nI had actually not heard of this, and a good friend recommended it. Reading the description and synopsis, I thought it would be one of those anime that would cheer you up when you're having a bad day; the result? It was so much more. The premise of the storyline may not seem like much, but thisanime left me so satisfied, I made sure I wasn't physically glowing with satiation.\\n\\n\r\nWhat made this so great was the combination of everyday characters with a comedic aspect and twist that led you from joke to joke flawlessly. The various pop-culture references mixed with completely different personalities from a variety of characters led to total and absolute hilarity. Though I'm not THAT much of an otaku myself, I managed to catch the gist of the jokes and had a humorous chuckle. I'm sure others with more experience with anime would fall in love with this show immediately.\\n\\n\r\nThe strong suit here was the characters. I give all the credit for this show's success and popularity to the characters. If you watch sitcoms (American ones, anyway) they are inundated with silly drama and pointless, circular storylines that everyone knows NEVER, EVER HAPPENS! Literally sit down, and watch an episode of a sitcom; how many times do those scenes happen in your life? Yea, never. This anime instead takes the point of view of actual high school girls and their thoughts and interactions; and they do so perfectly, from the start. They tend to long for a relationship and never seem to attract boys; isn't this more reflective of real life? Aren't we always WAITING for that special someone, rather than flirting and dating 24/7? This anime does more liberty to the average high schooler than I ever could have predicted.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the character development, overall the art was pleasant. It appealed to the eyes without paying too much attention to detail. Although the storyline was a bit repetitive at times, the jokes never strayed too far from reality, and it did progress over time. The characters' interactions kept me entertained, far more than it should have.....\\n\\n\r\nAh, well, that's enough gushing for a day. I love curling up in a blanket and watching anime, and this show was perfect for such an occasion. It left me more satisfied than a piece of cake, yet was pleasantly sweet and savory all the same. I thoroughly enjoyed everything this show has to offer, and you should too! Watch it; but be aware: it's otaku land from here on out!",

At first, I thought it was a little boring, But I gradually got used to the concept of their daily life from school to sleep.\r\nThere wasn't a major story line. Just different things that could actually happen in real life. The four girls were all friends and had different interests. The show started different the most shows I've seen. They talk about food, homework, boys, music, hobbies. Just about everything an average group of High School girls would talk about.Even though they all had different hobbies, they got along.\\n\r\nThe art was just fantastic! I loved the animation, and the movements that everyone made. How everything looked so real! The sound was also great. The background music, like it's supposed to, helped make the mood of the conversation. Say that they were asking Miyuki a question, The background music would make the atmosphere actually seem a bit confusing, because Miyuki knew so much, that she always confused Tsukasa. The Characters were lovely. They all had their own attitudes, and their own looks. There wasn't anything that I was able to see that made the characters look the same except for the characters that were blood related. Then they looked a bit like each other, but still had their own distinct look.\\n\r\nI enjoyed the show just because it cheered me up. The random conversations, and the interests that they had. Even a few of the jokes that the creator put in the show were quite amusing. Overall. I loved everything about the show. If I was able to change it, I wouldn't change one thing. I thought that it was absolutely wonderful.",

            "content": "Lucky Star is an anime that has no point, but to be amusing. Whether it's amusing is up to personal taste, but for me, it wasn't that amusing at all. \r\nStory: It's rubbish, and there's absolutely no plot to speak of. However, this is kind of the point of the show. In this case, story and plot doesn't matter as it was never intended to have a proper one, however as the viewer I think it's much more interesting to have a proper story and plot. It's up to tastes, but I still think it's bad. \r\n-1/10 for story.\r\nArt/Animation: While it does it's job, itdoesn't blow you away with it's glory, nor does it make you want to vomit. It's bright and colorful, however I truly don't care for it. It's meant to be cute, and based on your preferences, you may find it to be. I do not, however the art/animation does it's job and is alright.\\n\\n\r\n-5/10 for Art/Animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The characters all sounded cute and moe, as intended. The soundtrack? Nothing really stood out to me at all, and I found some of the tracks to be annoying. Only thing that really made a big impression on me was the opening, which was both amazing and terrifying. The sound did it's job and wasn't terrible.\\n\\n\r\n-6/10 for sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Oh boy, here we go. Alright, characters in Lucky Star were basically clear cut character archetypes. Konata is the otaku, Kagami the tsundere, Tsukasa the quiet and shy girl, and Miyuki is the smart girl who's ditsy. With no development to speak of, all we have to go on are the characters basic archetypes. All in all? They weren't anything special, and were essentially just trying to be amusing, which failed for me.\\n\\n\r\n4/10 for characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This was just about the most boring thing I've ever done, watching this show. I watched it because a friend suggested it, saying that it had references to other anime I liked and that I'd enjoy it. And he was absolutely wrong. In my mind, Lucky Star is pretty harmless in that it's not terrible, but at the same time it's incredibly boring and I found myself drifting off and thinking about other stuff when I watched this anime, which is usually a bad sign.\\n\\n\r\n3/10 for enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Lucky Star is essentially just Kyoto Ani masturbating to itself, what with references to other anime they worked on in the show, or having creators of the show dance and sing for some of the ending credits. While not a terrible anime, it's not one I would really recommend, unless you like slice of life's that have no real point. In that case you might like this anime, as with anime like this it's all up to personal preference anyways.\\n\\n\r\n-4/10 Overall.\\n\\n\r\nDub or Sub?: I typically watch shows subbed, but I watched this show subbed and dubbed on different episodes, and I can honestly say it doesn't matter. Basically if you prefer dubs, watch it dubbed, and if you prefer subs, watch it subbed.",

            "content": "When I used to hear about illiterate students graduating from school, I often wondered how that was possible. But after encountering some of Lucky Star's more pesky ultimata, I now realize that not only is it possible for people to graduate without having learned fundamental skills such as reading and writing, but that it's possible for these same people to believe that Lucky Star has the linguistic prowess to produce a masterwork of meritorious literature. The full truth of my conclusion I shall develop in the course of this letter but the conclusion's general outline is that when I first became aware of Lucky Star'scovert invasion into our thought processes, all I could think was how Lucky Star does not merely pit race against race, religion against religion, and country against country. It does so consciously, deliberately, willfully, and methodically. There's only one proper consideration here: the harm that'll be caused if Lucky Star is allowed to develop a Pavlovian reflex in us, to make us afraid to deal stiffly with pathological anarchists who interfere with the most important principles of democracy. All else is abstract, simple-minded, intellectual hooey. You shouldn't let Lucky Star intimidate you. You shouldn't let it push you around. We're the ones who are right, not Lucky Star.\\n\\n\r\nI plan to make plans and carry them out. This is a choice I have made; your choice is up to you. But let me remind you that I wonder if Lucky Star really believes the things it says. It knows they're not true, doesn't it? Whatever the answer, we must show Lucky Star that we are not powerless pedestrians on the asphalt of life. We must show it that we can urge lawmakers to pass a nonbinding resolution affirming that if its attendants get their way, society as we know it will cease to exist. Maybe then Lucky Star will realize that it takes things out of context, twists them around, and then neglects to provide decent referencing so the reader can check up on it. Lucky Star also ignores all of the evidence that doesn't support (or in many cases directly contradicts) its position.\\n\\n\r\nLucky Star wants me to stop trying to oppose evil wherever it rears its passive-aggressive, negligent head. Instead, it'd rather I suffer endless humiliation. Sorry, but I don't accept defeat that easily. If I am correctly informed, we will need to use diverse skills and tactics if we are to drag Lucky Star in front of a tribunal and try it for its crimes against humanity. In any case, it is not interested in what is true and what is false or in what is good and what is evil. In fact, those distinctions have no meaning to it whatsoever. The only thing that has any meaning to Lucky Star is defeatism. Why? In other words, what demons possessed Lucky Star to redefine unbridled self-indulgence as a virtue, as the ultimate test of personal freedom? Well, you don't need Sherlock Holmes to solve that mystery. Heck, you probably don't even need Scooby Doo. Neverthess, let me remind you that we must cross-examine Lucky Star's disorganized scribblings. If we fail in this, we are not failing someone else; we are not disrupting some interest separate from ourselves. Rather, it is we who suffer when we neglect to observe that I act based on what I think is right, not who I think is right. That's why I try always to make a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre out of exposing Lucky Star's schemes for what they really are. It's also why I say that its cause is not glorious. It is not wonderful. It is not good.\\n\\n\r\nIf Lucky Star's duplicitous campaigns became more widespread, it would spell the ruination of this country. Lucky Star plans to craft propaganda that justifies breaking down our communities. What can you do about that? Start by reading about how Lucky Star broadens its appeal by seeking influence and adherents in the colonialism movement. Become informed about the deceit, lies, and propaganda surrounding its promotion of sectarianism. Tell everyone you know that Lucky Star looks down upon the rest of us. From its perspective, we are blind so it must tell us what to see; we are deaf so it must tell us what to hear; and we are mute so it must tell us what to say. Such views may fool devious junkies, but I profess that if Lucky Star's attempts to capitalize on our needs and vulnerabilities have spurred us to embark on a new path towards change, then Lucky Star may have accomplished a useful thing.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know if Lucky Star is consciously and purposely evil or merely pharisaical. I do know, however, that it's easy for armchair philosophers to theorize about it and about hypothetical solutions to our Lucky Star problem. It's an entirely more difficult matter, however, when one considers that it says that those of us who oppose it would rather run than fight. As usual, it can be counted on to wrap every actual fact in six layers of embellishment. The truth is that what really sticks in my craw is seeing Lucky Star seek vengeance on those unrepentant souls who persist in challenging its maneuvers. (Note the heroic restraint stopping me from saying that as commonly encountered, feebleminded, shameless fiends lack any of the qualities that mark the civilized person, like courage, dignity, incorruptibility, ease, and confidence.) Lucky Star insists that it is better that a hundred thousand people should perish than that it should be even slightly inconvenienced. That lie is a transparent and strained effort to keep us from noticing that my position is that violence, mayhem, and insanity are the inevitable consequences of its ideals. Lucky Star, in contrast, argues that ebola, AIDS, mad-cow disease, and the hantavirus were intentionally bioengineered by obtuse Philistines for the purpose of population reduction. This disagreement merely scratches the surface of the ideological chasm festering between me and Lucky Star. The only rational way to bridge this chasm is for it to admit that it is always trying to change the way we work. This annoys me because Lucky Star's previous changes have always been for the worse. I'm positive that its new changes will be even more naive because Lucky Star wants to make incorrect leaps of logic. You know what groups have historically wanted to do the same thing? Fascists and Nazis. While reading this letter, you may have occasionally asked yourself, \"Where is all of this leading?\" and, \"What is the point exactly?\" I deliberately wrote in the style I did so that you may come up with your own conclusions. Therefore, I leave you with only the following: Lucky Star loves Trotskyism more than life itself.",

Cut-and-paste is not comedy, it's lazy money grubbing.\\n\\n\r\nTo make things worse most of those refs are obscure reaching out only to non-classic shows, making it impossible to get half of these nowadays without using google while watching. And even then it's the same issue, not inventing comedy just relying on familiarity all the way. In fact it's obscurities go for  the recent shows because they're still fresh in people's mind (at that time), making it easier to manipulate the viewer into an emotional corner. Hell it's not about actually parodying some aspect of a different show in the first place, just putting in the popular material so it's recognized by the viewer (ahh that warm nostalgic feeling) and let's move on who cares. That's what you do when you have no talent and love the smell of benjamins.\\n\\n\r\nTo maximize the effectiveness of the marketing stunt add some moe pandering with typical sol, since that's the target audience most likely to buy dvd's. And by typical I mean the static, unwitty, unrealistic, boring ass shit you saw in every other maken-ki or azumanga daioh. With loli bait cuz that sells. One might think \"slice-of-life\" would indicate some actual realism or life lessons. Oh poor naive me..\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah it's a major failure as a comedy because it doesn't attemp any. It's not a parody because it doesn't bother to parody what it references. I'd give it an extra point for that catchy jpop song but let's be serious here. A classic? Classic example of what greed can do to people maybe. In a way it indeed is a milestone - as it marked the beginning of brand new direction of abandoning all notions of creativity for the sake of pumping poor sods of their money clean. Good job helping the industry decline even further KyoAni, good job.\\n\\n\r\nLucky Star is NOT a \"love or hate\" type of show, it's a \"either you get suckered in by the cheap trick or see through it\" type of show. It's bait anime - bait of your favourite shows references, bait of lolis, bait of otaku self-insertion Konata (imagine if instead a girl there was an obese smelly creep in front of a pc). Watching it in a year when all the obscurities it refers are well faded-out is the best way to disillusion yourself. \\n\\n\r\nCommercialism at it's lowest, laziest worst.\\n\r\n1/10 \\n",

            "content": "Coming off the heels of the heartstring tugging K-On!! and the absurdly funny  Azumanga Daioh, I found Lucky Star a bit flat. Of the three shows, Lucky Star is by far the most self-aware. It knows exactly what it is and who it is trying to appeal to, and upon achieving that, seeks to do no more. While all of these moe-centric shows are murderously slow and ultimately go practically nowhere as far as plot is concerned, they are redeemed by their breezily entertaining demeanor once you settle into them. Moments of true comedic brilliance shine through every once in a while and evenmoments of genuine depth are displayed. Lucky Star just doesn't have as many of these moments as its competition. Konata, the main character, is the one unique aspect of the show, essentially a female personification of the otaku lifestyle that many viewers will identify with. Her insights and quips about the obsessive and bizarre nature of Otaku culture are by far, the show's best moments- and the most absurd. A certain re-occurring plot theme involving Konata and a group of impassioned manga shop clerks, who idealize her as the otaku's dream girl, are particularly funny because they seem to be in on the show's joke. The gleefully bizarre, Vocaloid referencing OVA conclusion is also a highlight.\\n\r\n\tThe big problem is that the rest of the time, when the show is in typical schoolgirl moe-show mode, it's just kinda boring. The banter between the four main girls is less nuanced than K-On!!'s and far less abstract than Azumanga Daioh's weirder moments. It's just cookie cutter characters exchanging mundane dialogue about nothing in particular. Look no further than the first episode's 15 minute pastry conversation for an example of the general pacing of the show.\\n\r\n\tLucky Star takes it's look from the 4-panel manga by the same name. The characters are ultra-chibi to the point of being a bit on the overly-simplified side. Their faces don't really emote much. Where as K-On!!'s characters displayed a surprising amount of depth in their subtle facial animations, the same care wasn't taken by KyoAni on this series. I suppose it falls in line with the fact that these characters just don't have the same degree of believability or human attraction.\\n\r\n\t Lucky Star may have waned in popularity since K-On!! seemingly took it's place as the epitome of moe anime. Despite a decreased distance between the viewer, the main character essentially serving as a bridge, Lucky Star ultimately shys away from ever taking itself seriously enough to be little more the most derivative thing that moe can be- a sly parody of the schoolgirl tropes aware of it's exploitative nature.",

            "content": "As with unspoken tradition, I declare this my first review. I also kinda fail at describing things, so forgive me if this sounds a too bit plain.\r\nNow, unlike expectations of reviews, especially for this anime, I won't be radiating an aura of hate, nor try and claim that this is the greatest anime in existence. And yet I still choose to give it a 9.\r\nLucky Star a simple slice-of-life type based off of a 4koma, so don't go expecting tons of plot or character development. It's a story following a bunch of girls living their life, having fun their way. If you absolutely need yourplot, don't watch this then complain. It makes for a relaxing set up, no tension nor anticipation. No romance, no action. That doesn't necesarrily mean it's boring. If you think this is outright boring, I would like you to think about your everyday life and if it is at all significantly more exciting, you should suggest it as a plot for a new anime. The point of Lucky Star is that there is no real point, except to make some anime references and keep a light and funny mood. Sure, it pokes fun at otaku culture, jokes that many people might not get. But even still, that doesn't make it impossible to enjoy. Simple gags and jokes are aplenty, but when put together can amount to something genuinely funny.\\n\\n\r\nConsidering how the enjoyment of art depends on the person, I'll say this. If you look at the art and find the characters cute or moe, then by all means you are welcome to explore the anime. For those that cannot tolerate \"moe trash,\" do not come into this and proceed to complain. The scenery itself is infrequent, as general comedic backgrounds are used. But how much time is spent admiring the background? I'm sure many would say that with an anime where nothing happens, the background may be the most entertaining thing. But seeing the expressions and reactions of the characters is why the characters exist in the first place, am I right?\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves fall under basic archetypes. Konata is the abnormally short genki otaku, with her happy-go-lucky persona and anime-focused mind which causes everyday events to have some relation to anime, as well as result in random comments. Kagami is tsukkomi tsundere, playing the tough one with common sense, yet has a sweet side which she takes care to hide. Tsukasa is the dojikko, whose clumsiness and ignorant ways are meant to amplify her cuteness. Miyuki is the tensai meganekko, the book smart glasses girl with the notable chest. The interaction of such characters is as one expects them to be, and Lucky Star makes sure this holds true. With this, the characters seem flat and uninteresting, but it's their predictable ways that appeal.\\n\\n\r\nA side note for some things that show up in the anime: As before, it likes to make references to anime. But due to being produced by KyoAni, not just references, but Suzumiya Haruhi paraphanelia is not just snuck in, but blatantly displayed. Other than being more advertisment for Haruhi (and in turn KyoAni) it serves no other purpose. They're still Haruhi references. As for the OVA that comes after, it's more of the same, but that's not necessarily a reason to avoid it.\\n\\n\r\nThis review should have done at least one of two things now: Convince you to steer clear of this plain anime, or piqued you interest into deciding to check the anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow into the personal stuff. As I've said, not everyone needs or wants to know, so feel free to skip.\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime to the fullest. Anime references, plain humor, and moe-type girls are things I enjoy finding in anime, and the anime accomplished with me what it meant to: keep me relaxed and entertained. There times when I know I've thought along the same lines as the characters (especially Konata), and times when they've made me realize some simple things in my everyday life. As a self-proclaimed otaku, I definitely feel connected with the for-otaku feel that the anime exhibits. For these reasons, as well as the fact that it never disappointed me, I gave Lucky Star a 9.\\n\\n\r\nFor all those fanatics out there that think I'm helping prove that Lucky Star is a god-send, please know that I am only stating my view of it.\\n\r\nFor all those haters, please know the same.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd if for no other reason other than spite you want to give my review a low rating, if it makes you feel better about yourself, by all means give it a \"Not Helpful.\" If you truly found it not helpful, then you are still welcome to rate it as such.",

The problem wasn't the subject, but the fact that the topic ran on for a long time and I don't have time to sit and listen to how is the best way to eat a certain food.\r\nSecond, it reminded me too much of some of the conversations that I had with my friends in highschool. Except the one I saw was even more random and was pointless. I will admit though, it was very funny. But the thingis, there is only so much jokes that can be packed into one setting, where these food comments could have been spread out more.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art was what drew me into it in the first place. The designs art wise for the characters were very cute. But unfortunatly, they ran in chibi form way too much for my liking and the outside characters were like sticks in the walls. The art focused way too much on the girls.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nI loved the music for the series. It had a very good feeling, but it was downplayied unfortunatly by everything else.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were way too two dementional. One really couldn't get who they were, except that the one girl was good at everything, but wanted to watch Anime and play games. She was way too stereotyped.

I found the whole being an Anime fanatic funny, but the whole food thing was dull and took way to long.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe whole show wasn't something I would want to pick up again. It was... how to put it, boring me to sleep. I was drawn in by the art and the music, but talking about random things and doing nothing is to me not that great.",

            "content": "Lucky Star is a 4-panel manga series by Kagami Yoshimizu that began publishing in 2004, and is still being published today. In 2007, Kyoto Animation, hot off the success of Haruhi, made an anime adaptation. I watched it. I also sampled the manga version. It was . . . okay, I guess. But let's elaborate on the anime some more, shall we?\r\nStory: In present-day Japan, a number of girls in high school live out their lives studying, making jokes about Gundam, being eccentric, making fun of cliches in fiction, and . . . that's about it, really. The four main girls are Konata Izumi, aself-proclaimed otaku (though fortunately one more functional than every real-life otaku I've met), Kagami Hiiragi, a no-nonsense \"Tsundere\", Tsukasa Hiiragi, Kagami's moeblob twin-sister, and Miyuki Takara, a really smart moeblob. There are many more characters than this, but they're the main focus.\\n\\n\r\nBecause this is based off a 4-panel series, many plot threads, if you can call them that, often end abruptly, with little-to-no resolution. Some of the jokes from the manga don't translate as well into anime format. The show never veers into anything truly dark in terms of plot. It's mostly jokes and weird observations. Essentially, it's like Azumanga Daioh, but with characters with wild hair colors. And after the series and OVA sequel ends, there's no resolution of any sort.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, every episode also ends with a segment called \"Lucky Channel\", which features different characters and actually has an ongoing (and pretty funny) story. Sadly, these segments aren't that long. Yeah, Lucky Star is not something you watch for enlightenment. 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I'm gonna be honest; I don't like the artwork of Lucky Star. The character designs are meant to be cute, but most of them don't look cute, just childish. The coloring is often garish, and Miyuki's hair is so bright, it nearly blinded me on a few occasions.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, the animation is somewhat fluid for a tv series. So it's not a complete disaster on the visual front, but this show obviously does not focus on visuals. 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The theme song is infamous. Some hate it, some love it. I find it . . . okay. The ending themes are renditions of earlier anime ending themes, most of which I didn't recognize. They're alright. The background music is just there, doesn't really add anything.\\n\\n\r\nI saw this in English, as well as bits in Japanese on random Youtube channels. Weirdly enough, Lucky Star has one of the best English dubs I have ever heard. Its voice-acting is even better than most American cartoon shows I've seen! I'm not kidding! Look at this old quote of mine from tvtropes.org:\\n\\n\r\n\"Lucky Star has one of the best English dubs I've ever heard. Every character sounds exactly how I would picture their voices to be. None of the voices are annoying nor awkward sounding. They also match the lip flaps pretty closely, too. Wendee Lee especially displays great range in Konata's voice. It's impossible for me to watch the show in Japanese now; the dub is that good.\"\\n\\n\r\nI still stand by that today. Also, Kari Wahlgren's version of Kagami blows her Japanese counterpart completely out of the water. Anyone who does English dubs of Japanese productions, be they industry professionals or fandubbers, watch Lucky Star and take notes; THIS is how you do an English dub. And you wonder why I worship every Bandai dub out there that's not Code Geass. 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization: For all of its faults, some of the characters are quite likable and amusing. Konata is silly, yet charming. Kagami's bewilderment is amusing. Many side characters, such as Konata's dad and Anime Tenchou are funny. The best characters, however, are the Lucky Channels stars Akira Kogami and Minoru Shiraishi.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there's not a lot of depth to Lucky Star's cast. Also, several of its female characters are moe archetypes (or moeblobs) that don't really do much. Well, Konata's cousin Yutaka is adorable, but none of the others strike me as cute, just shallow. (Well, Tsukasa has a couple of funny moments.) And even the characters I do like don't have much to their characterizations. Look, Konata's comparing something to a game/anime again! Kagami is frustrated with someone's antics again! Tsukasa is clueless about something again! The characters aren't annoying, but I can only rate them slightly above-average. 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I will say this, there's usually only one funny moment per episode of Lucky Star outside of Lucky Channel, but that one moment is usually laugh-out-loud hilarious. Also, most of Lucky Channel is flat out hilarious. The English dub really helps with my enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nBut for a show focused only on comedy, it's not one of the better examples of anime comedy I've seen. Haruhi Suzumiya was funnier, and also served an interesting sci-fi plot. Soul Eater is way funnier, and also has cool action scenes and characters. Welcome to the NHK was funnier, and deeper and more dramatic. Sgt Frog and Gintama are both more centered on comedy, and also funnier.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, I do like the anime version of Lucky Star more than the anime version of Azumanga Daioh. And believe me when I say I've seen a lot worse than Lucky Star out there, too. However, LS is, at best, only slightly rising above mediocrity. 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nI do like the manga version of Lucky Star more, but only slightly. (I would probably give that a 7 out of 10, despite the lack of Lucky Channel in that.) I don't want to say LS is overrated. Yeah, it's not as good as I hoped it would be, but I've been let down by other animes a lot more. At least I was able to finish LS. It's not a classic, but if you're bored enough, you might want to check it out. Just mind the bright colors.",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nSome people think Neon Genesis Evangelion is a divisive anime that people either love or hate. While NGE is fairly divisive, it PALES in comparison to Lucky Star. This is the show where you will either be a rabid fanboy or fangirl, or you will be an extreme hater that wants to garrote the fanboys with piano wire as seen in Takashi Miike's  Audition.\r\nPlot: 1/10\r\nRemember Seinfeld from the 1990s? It was a show famous for being about absolutely nothing. Absurd but loveable characters have random conversations about often mundane topics while making witty observational remarks. Seinfeld used this simplistic \"plot\" to become the mostfinancially succesful show in American history. Seinfeld accomplished this by 1. being extremely well written and 2. being fucking hilarious. Lucky Star is like a poorly written, painfully unfunny Seinfeld clone created by otaku for an audience of otaku and hikikomori. Even as a huge fan of anime, I can't tell you how much I hated this series. There are 2 types of scenes in Lucky Star: boring scenes and obnoxious scenes. While the characters have random conversations about anime, H-sims, and other otaku topics you will quickly find yourself either bored or annoyed by the grating characters. Most people want to watch anime or TV to be entertained or be stimulated either intellectually or emotionally. Reading a passage on coarctation of the aorta in an extremely dry cardiophysiology textbook is funnier than fucking Lucky Star. How is this a comedy? I hate the characters. I'm serious, I HATE all of them! Otaku love Konata and think she is so adorable, but I honestly can't see the appeal. Is it SO novel and hilarious that girls can be geeks too? There is VERY little character development or depth in this pile of shit, so unlike Seinfeld watching for the characters makes little sense here.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is below average, but what would you expect for a series in which people stand around talking. That kind of show doesn't need a high budget. For further evidence watch Tom Goes to the Mayor. Actually don't because that show is almost as bad as Lukcy Star.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is absolute ear sodomy. Every track in this OST makes me want to punch children and puppies!\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nI had more fun breaking my leg in 3 places than I did watching Lucky Star.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nLucky Star avoids being the worst anime of all time by at least pleasing SOMEONE. It actually has fans and accomplished exactly what it set out to do. This places it above the worst of the worst. It can't compete against Mars of Destruction and Kodomo no Jikan for the title of worst ever, but it is easily in my top 10 series I had the least pleasant time watching.",

            "content": "Lucky Star.  Just wow.  What an amazingly pathetic attempt at an anime.  Slice of life animes I can get - they have stories, they can have strong character relationships and they might occasionally be something you can relate with in your life. \r\nStory: 0 -  Lucky Star - I'd rather watch 15 minutes of The Hills than watch 15 minutes of a group of people discussing on how one goes about eating a certain food - or any other subject that they discuss.  To me there is no story here. None.  Imagine the hottest, but stupidest, girl in yourschool talking to you  about a handbag for fifteen minutes.  You want to enjoy her but just can't because she is so bloody annoying.  Lucky star for you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: Art is fine - your standard slice of life art if anything... \\n\\n\r\nSound: Aside from the nonsense you hear from the characters ; Sound is pretty average.  The only thing that is awesome about this anime is the intro music.  One of the best ever I must admit that.    \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2  Sure they have their own \"personalities\" but thats it did not get any sense of attachment other then \"Will you be my friend???? Yayyyyyy\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 0.  This is the first anime I found to, pardon my french, piss me off.  there are slice of life animes that i enjoy - they have an actual story.  This doesn't.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1 - The only thing that I really liked about this anime was the intro music.  That was pretty good.  Other than that - I can't really see why I should watch an anime that  has managed  really piss me off.. its not just that the story is not that good  or I'm just not into it -  like Code Geass S02, Black Lagoon s02 - both animes I like but the sequels not so much. 4 chicks in just talking about a random subject is just plain boring.  I understand that its classified itself as a comedy - and i can like comedies, but maybe I just have higher standards than most of my anime peers.",

This series is a slice of life moe blob where the four main characters just talk about normal everyday stuff (For example: How to eat a chocolate cornett.) I wish there was a 0 rating for story, but I'll give it a three, only because of the many references.\r\nThe Art- The art is colorful. That's it. 7/10\r\nThe Sound- The background music is just that, background music. The op drove me insane with it's all over the place, over complicated, and colorful themes like I'm watching an american kids show. 4/10\r\nEnjoyment- The main show didn't entertain me at all. I would puta 1/10 if it wasn't for LUCKY CHANNEL which was the whole highlight and the funniest part of the show. The female character in Lucky Channel turns from another moe blob into one of the most hilarious personalities in the show, turning into a know it all with 99 problems and her acting ain't one. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Lucky Channel:9/10\\n\r\n              Lucky Star:1/10\\n\r\nThey should make Lucky Channel its own anime. As for Lucky star, I wish it gets buried into the endless grave of terrible anime along with School Days, Boku no Pico, and MM!\\n\\n\r\nOh, wait. Did I skip characters? Aw, too bad. :)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Hold on a sec.  I recognize the art.  It's...Lucky Star, right?\r\nNK: You are correct.\r\nT: I thought your sister said to avoid it like the plague.\r\nNK: Bah, I decided to watch it anyway.  Good thing I did.\r\nT: I take it you like the series, then.\r\nNK: Very much so.  I'd even go as far as to place it in my top 10, if not my top 5.\r\nT: Wow.  You'regetting a bit crowded in your top 10, aren't you?\\n\r\nNK: Unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nT: So, Slice of Life.  Basically, take real life, add a twist and proceed, right?\\n\r\nNK: Mostly.\\n\r\nT: So, what's the twist in this one, then?\\n\r\nNK: Hmm...I think the most it does outside of real life is parody video games and anime.  That's about it.\\n\r\nT: No child skipping an abnormal amount of grades?  No student who turns out to be god?  No transfer student having to remember his past while juggling a bunch of girls who are tied to that past?\\n\r\nNK: Nope, though the anime you're thinking of in that last comment is referenced twice in the series, and the second one you brought up is referenced in every other episode, it seems.\\n\r\nT: That seems a bit...plain...\\n\r\nNK: It is.  Though I think it's part of the reason I like it.\\n\r\nT: How come?\\n\r\nNK: Well, the characters are easier to relate to, as are the situations.  It's basically two years of high school crammed in to 24 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nT: Well, you do always like to mention characters first.  How are they in Lucky Star?  Do they develop in drastic ways?\\n\r\nNK: I wouldn't really call it developing.  More like we just find out more about them in each episode.  The series really focuses on Konata and Kagami, though Tsukasa does see a fair share of screen time thanks to her sister, and Miyuki is talked about a lot.\\n\r\nT: So, it's kind of like how you learn more about your friends as you see them more often.\\n\r\nNK: Right.\\n\\n\r\nT: Interesting.  So, who's your favorite?  I'm going to guess Konata, since she's supposed to be the otaku.\\n\r\nNK: Supposed to be?  She is an otaku, and it seems like she's proud of the title.  Oh, and you're wrong.  She is not my favorite.\\n\r\nT: Really?  I couldn't imagine Kagami being it, either.  Oh, dear...it's Tsukasa, isn't it?\\n\r\nNK: How'd you guess?\\n\r\nT: The big eyes, the ribbon in the hair.  She sort of stands out as the cute one.\\n\r\nNK: Yeah, she's my favorite character.  She's a bit of an airhead, so I think that's part of it.\\n\\n\r\nT: I swear...anyway, you said \"high school\", right?\\n\r\nNK: I sure did.\\n\r\nT: They look a lot younger than that.\\n\r\nNK: Tricked me at first, too.  It's a bit strange, I'll grant you that, but I actually found it really interesting to make the characters look younger than they were.\\n\r\nT: It makes it harder to take the series seriously that way.\\n\r\nNK: I didn't know you were supposed to take the series seriously.\\n\\n\r\nT: Good point.  How about the music?  I noticed it was a bit bland when I came in.\\n\r\nNK: That pretty much describes half of the background music.  The music they play during conversations isn't really supposed to grab your attention.  They save the good music for Konata's video games and the really funny scenes.\\n\r\nT: You have the soundtrack, I take it.\\n\r\nNK: Well, about half of the BGM collection...yes.\\n\\n\r\nT: Anyway, I think I'm going to head out.  Oh, almost forgot.  Language?\\n\r\nNK: Japanese, for me.  That's what I first watched it in.  The English isn't bad, but I'm just used to the Japanese.\\n\r\nT: You think others would like it?\\n\r\nNK: If you understand otaku culture, it's easy to figure out what's going on.  There are enough different characters that almost any person watching the series can attach to someone.  The only reason someone wouldn't like it is because there's really not a lot going on.  It's pretty low key for an anime.",

            "content": "Lucky Star has always been a popular anime. However, I truly cannot understand its popularity. It's written as a comedy, but the jokes narrow down to a single punchline that's delivered in a \"here-it-is\" manner. There are some very funny episodes, but many of them are labored and boring.\r\nStory:\r\nEach story is contained within the episode. There isn't much of a plot, just the everyday lives of the girl students. The lack of plot could easily be made up with fast-paced humor, but most of the jokes revolve around 4-5 minute segments that are unnecessary and obnoxious.  \r\nArt:\r\nThe art is a bit better than most,but the style itself is sub par. It attempts to be almost chibi-styled, but comes across with a complete lack of anatomy instead. Still, the coloring and background details are astounding.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe theme song is a generic high-pitch J-pop song. It is attempting to be ironic, especially in the lyrics, but the voice actresses singing of it grates on your eardrums. The music within the episodes is reasonable background music, but nothing is excellent, instead mostly average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters are stereo-typical Japanese characters. A tsundere, a meganekko, a pervert...the secondary characters are so generic they can easily be swapped around.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI was mostly bored with this series, and so put it on hold. Each story is repetitive, and the characters are hard to empathize with.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nLucky Star recieves a 6 because of its detailed artwork, lack of story, obnoxious sound, and flat characters.",

            "content": "Had a stressful day? Watched any minf*cking anime lately and wanna cool off? Or you just wanna take a good chuckle and forget your problems? Lucky \u2606 Star can do that!\r\nLucky Star is one of the most unique animes I've seen my whole life. The art is plain and simple, there is no definite storyline, there is really no action, there are just some high school girls talking about their everyday life but that's the good part. This is a slice of life anime that I've never seen before. The characters are just plain examples of moe and without you knowing you're loving them already,without you knowing it you're probably laughing already and without you knowing you've already forgotten your problems... already!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8~\\n\r\nSome of you may drop the show at its 1st episode because all you see and hear are some high school girls talking about their problems, issues or just random talk that rarely happens in anime, it's similar to a sitcom instead of a straightforward plot you usually see in a typical show. You probably won't be interested in some of them but unlike those American sitcoms, stuff that they talk about in Lucky Star happens in real life! Like have you ever thought of an amusing idea and decide to write it but when you're gonna write it already you suddenly forget it? Have you ever got so tired studying that you wanted to take break by playing a game but you end up having a longer break than actually studying? But what if you can't relate to it? Don't give up! Since Lucky Star is a parody, is has various anime and pop-culture reference I'm sure you might recognize. But I'm gonna be honest, I didn't understand some jokes because I ain't no hardcore otaku :P There are still lots of funny and hilarious scenes that I'm pretty sure you will not be able to contain your laughter.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9~\\n\r\nHonestly, when I was looking at some images and gif's of Lucky Star I was thinking, wth is this? Are the artists too lazy to draw better? But in the end the art is actually one of the main things that made me come to love this show. If you have noticed, they mostly show just the upper half of the characters body. The static backgrounds are pretty plain as well as the scenery and the characters don't really go in detail. But I'm pretty sure the first adjective you could use to describe them is, cute. You don't really need detailed art for this anime, simply because, this is a parody. You need the viewers to concentrate on what the characters are saying and doing rather than being amazed by how detailed the characters look. I also believed that they were drawn that way because it was suppose to be a joke. Since this was a parody after all. I mean the parts where they show some reference to other animes, the characters there looked well drawn. For example, there was a scene where they show Haruhi, she was drawn so well that it made me think is something wrong with the file I download and they inserted some Haruhi scene?\\n\r\nI gotta say they were animated well ^^ Especially the OP, the characters dancing were just so cuute... HNGGGGGGG.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9~\\n\r\nI immediately got captivated by the moe at the OP. The cute characters dancing fit so well with the lively and adorable music made by Aya Hirano and co. The background music also fit well while conversations are on-going and doesn't overpower the voices. There are also some parts where they sing some songs from different animes and even sing some popular Japan music (most of the singing is done by Shiraishi, you'll come to know him in the latter episodes. He's an epic guy I'll tell you).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10~\\n\r\nAh, the characters. I want to start off with the blue-haired otaku, Konata. She's one of those people who play video games and read manga all day rather than studying. She crams last minute, she leaves her books at school since she doesn't study at home and surprisingly she's athletic. I see myself in her in many different ways. You might get annoyed by her or come to love her. Up next are the twin sisters Kagami and Tsukasa. Konata views Kagami as a tsundere since she has a ponytail. Kagami takes studying more seriously than her sister and Konata. She also has 2 other friends but I wont go into them in detail. Her sister Tsukasa is probably her complete opposite. She's lazy, forgetful, likes to sleep in, pretty much your regular airhead. Another airhead but a smart one is Miyuki. As I quote from Konata, she's a walking example of moe. She probably has the biggest chest in the show. There toooons of characters that will show up as the anime progresses and I could say they are all well defined.\\n\r\nJust a special mention character, Shiraishi, Minoru. The live one not the animated one (but the animated character is pretty awesome as well ^^). That guy is just epic in so many ways. A big portion of my laughs come from this guy. He'll show up at the latter episodes of the show singin' some parodies of songs. I just cannot express how epic he is.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9~\\n\r\nI obviously enjoyed this show quite a lot.  From the OP to the next episode preview, I never got bored. I haven't seen a single episode that was painful to watch and this show just brightens my day. But I rated this 9 because there were really just some jokes that I couldn't relate with because I still don't know much about the anime world D:\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9~\\n\r\nThis show is a must watch for everyone. You may hate it, like it or come to love it. This is not a cup of tea for everyone because there are some people who judge the whole anime by its first impression but I gotta say you should stick a little more and I'm certain you'll come to like this show more and more :)\\n\\n\r\n*This is my first review for a TV anime btw*",

            "content": "In my time watching anime, I have not watched any (so far) quite like Lucky Star. It's simple yet amusing approach to comedy is very addicting, and it covers a large range of topics. Basically it focuses on the life of average japanese high-school girls. After that, hilarity ensues.\r\n  From the beginning I wasn't too interested in it, I thought it was dull and boring. But I gave it a chance. And I'm pretty effing happy I gave it that chance, becase I found myself short of breath from laughing. There are so many referances to anime and manga, mostly,  butit also parodies things that relate to everyone in everyday life.\\n\\n\r\n  As for the direction and art style, it fits perfectly with the storie's premise. Cute and sometimes wacky *I can't beleive I just said &quot;wacky&quot;* the expressions on the characters faces are priceless, and are sometimes better than the reason the made those expressions. Without giving too much away, I will say that when the art style gets &quot;serious&quot;, it's often the funniest part of the show. \\n\\n\r\n  The music is slightly Animal Crossing-esq, with a casual yet appealing sound, that really sets the mood. The voices (In the japanese VO) are very well done, matching each character almost perfectly. As for the characters themselves, they are the best part of Lucky Star! Each character has their own personality, and each one is drawn out to a stereotypical point. For example: Kagami is one of the main characters, and is often ill-temperd and down to earth, so it shows on her very often, to the dismay of Konata especially.\\n\\n\r\n  I loved this anime, and the only thing that can match the overall enjoyment of this in my opinion is Cowboy Bebop. It's a very different anime from what I'm used to, i.e; Dragonball, Hunter X Hunter, ect., but it's different in an amazing way.",

I was a bit leery, thinking it would be some annoying chibi show for kids but upon watching, I was delightfully shocked!\r\nThe main character, Konata, is SO like I was in high school that after 10 minutes of watching I just had to pause so I could laugh at myself. And all the inside jokes... pure hilarity! The humor ranges from gamer jokes, anime references, and voice actors in unusual (or very usual) situations to family relationships (as one of 3 sisters I KNOW just what it's like), random conversations with friends, and allthe drama of heading off to college.\\n\\n\r\nFunny as the show is, it truly has a heart and a good basis in life. I have actually had many of the events in the anime happen to me, as I'm sure a good few of the other fans have as well. Something as commonplace as forgetting a textbook takes on a new face, and I can't help but remember some of my desperate antics trying to scrape by on test scores.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond that all the little details slipped in make the series all the more interesting and unusual for those who know what to look for... things like the beloved &quot;Anime Director&quot;'s overzealous attempts to squeeze out the next purchase... does that voice sound a bit familiar? Also, and more obviously, there is Konata's fixation on a certain other anime... another casting coincidence? I think not.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, this is a must-see for anyone who's ever called themselves an otaku (or been accused of it), or for someone looking for a really relaxing and fun show minus the nailbiting for the next installment!",

In fact, it's kind of pointless. There's no direction in which the plotline is going...Instead, they're talking about what kind of bikini to wear for a third of the episode. \r\nCharacters...Ah the characters. In this one, I really have NOTHING to say about the characters, because I KNOW nothing about them. There's the twins, the big-boobed nerd, and the protagonist, who's incoherent halfthe time...Oh wait, they ALL are. It's okay to have comedy, but really? The mangaka focuses more on comedy than the actual story. Way to go.\\n\r\nIt's not very enjoyable just to watch girls go on and on about cellphones, lunches, and whatever crap they feel like. It's like math...It goes on and on. Repetition is NOT the foundation for a good story.\\n\r\nThe art is good....I'm always won over by pretty art, but the mangaka has to work on character development, and plot. Please?",

            "content": "Look up comedy in the dictionary.  If it doesn\u2019t say \u201cLucky Star\u201d there then you should write it in.  Very funny and incredibly smart Lucky Star pokes fun at the most ordinary things in life, and does it brilliantly.\r\nEven though this series is a few years old, I only recently saw this on the top anime page of MAL.  I was quite astounded to find that this was #130, when (judging by the anime above it) in my opinion it deserves to be much higher.  And it was then that I saw the divided reviews, some giving it ridiculously low scores.So, despite it being somewhat futile, I decided to write a review on it.\\n\\n\r\nI have given Lucky Star marks based on the categories of storyline, art etc only because I had to.  To be honest, I think it is impossible to review Lucky Star in such a general way.  This is the kind of anime that comes along very rarely, one that attempts to innovate and stand out from the crowd.  The best way to define the genre would be \u201cpure slice of life\u201d, abrupt and somewhat in-your-face, and I think this is what unnerves some people and prevents them from opening up to the series.  It bombards you with jokes and various comedic references almost in passing.  Hence, a lot of people fail to comprehend punch lines and complain about the lack of storyline.  Unfortunately they\u2019re completely missing the point.\\n\\n\r\nThis story is about the very ordinary lives of a very ordinary group of schoolgirls.  The style is exactly like a person reflecting upon a yesterday and laughing to himself as he remembers all the amusing things that happened.  He omits the boring parts and various unrelated conversations he had during his very ordinary day and focuses only on the funny or strange bits.  The fact that, like an ordinary person\u2019s life, it has no over-arching storyline is the whole point of the show.  Why did I give it 10 for story then?  Basically because I believe it does what it sets out to do brilliantly, and should be rewarded for it.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching a few episodes you tend to settle into the rhythm of the show and appreciate it much more.  The jokes themselves are hilarious, making fun of both the extremely ordinary as well as the bizarre.  Countless references to other popular anime and otaku culture also provide a source of genuine laughs.  A few heart-warming moments are also there to balance it up nicely.  Once you get into it the enjoyment factor is definitely a maximum, but this isn\u2019t a show you can rush through.  The best way to watch it is a couple of episodes at a time, complimenting each with slices of your own life.  In fact, after watching I find it hard to go through a day without a potential Lucky Star reference.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is also top-notch.  Going for more of a semi-chibi style, it does a great job in complimenting the light-heartedness of the show.  The backgrounds are exactly that; 2d backdrops that are there to add a bit of depth to the art but nothing more.  However, this works well to compliment the simple art style and the focus on dialogue.  As well as the catchy opening theme, the hilarious and unique endings, the background music also aids the light-hearted atmosphere.  The characters are definitely the show\u2019s biggest strength.  Each character plays a role in reflecting on another side of life, from the outright ridiculous otaku Konata to the calm, somewhat introverted Minami.  Varied and original, they really inject an energy into the anime that really makes you want to keep watching.  Add to that the talented voice actors, many of whom also did the popular The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, and loads of ironic Haruhi references and you\u2019ve got a very funny mix.  (I definitely recommend watching Haruhi before Lucky Star so you can get these jokes.)\\n\\n\r\nThere is no question the Lucky Star is quirky and unique, and is shunned by some viewers because of this.  I am of the opposite opinion, however.  This is a show that dares to be different, and should be celebrated as a very successful experiment by Kyoto Animation.  Truly one of the greatest comedy anime ever made.",

            "content": "In the year 2007 A.D., a fire was fermenting in the Kyoto Animation studio. Crisp off the accomplishment of Haruhi Suzumiya and possessing a scent like farts and ramen-scented personal stench, the staff of KyoAni built up a sharp intend to additionally drain endless wads of cashmoney from disgraceful washouts and pedophiles on the two sides of the pacific: take a prevalent 4 board comic arrangement ready with the components that made Suzumiya a monetary achievement (pandering to close in weeaboos with lolicon activity figure accumulations and terabytes of hentai) and transform it into a similarly shocking anime arrangement. Subsequent to spending indefatigable hours handcraftingjust the stalest jokes, the blandest craftsmanship, and the most mindnumbingly exhausting contents in Japanese TV history, Yushiro Takemoto opened his rear-end and took a gigantic poo onto a close-by Tokyo walkway. Millions ogled at the greatness of his defecation: extents this extraordinary hadn't been seen since U2 discharged the waterboarding-like torturefest that was \"The means by which to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\" in 2004. When Norwegian researchers had been given appropriate time to mass, perform tests on, and take pictures with said crap, Takemoto was advised he expected to give it a name. He picked Lucky Star. \\n\\n\r\nMuch like those muffle electric stun pens you offered out to your companions as a trick in the fourth grade, Lucky Star deceives you into watching it under the appearance that it's a \"satire\", however in actuality it's to a lesser extent a chuckle fest and a greater amount of an activity in sadomasochism. Part of the way through the main scene I was persuaded that watching this must be the rage of a vindictive God, purpose on rebuffing me for my past slips and disappointments. By scene 2 I had been diminished to a vegetable, as the show had actually sucked all the vitality from me. By scene 9 this condition ended up perpetual, as I had transformed my once-stunning lounge into a no man's land and my once perfect clothing into a net for getting the looseness of the bowels that leaked from my petrified butt nugget. By scene 16 I had sufficiently accumulated vitality to endeavor suicide. After a short recuperation spell in the doctor's facility, I was put on antidepressants and bear sedatives, and sometime I advised my advisor that I expected to overcome my evil presences unequivocally and complete this arrangement. He endorsed, however just on one condition: that I watch it with him present in the room. I endeavored to talk sense into him, yet he demanded that \"he's seen a great deal of things in his time, alot of them a considerable measure more regrettable than anything a Japanese animation could toss at him.\" \\n\\n\r\nHe later shot himself in a Staples parking area. \\n\\n\r\nTo say it evidently, Lucky Star is the direct opposite of diversion. There is not all that much, shrewd, clever, or remotely intriguing about the show. Weeaboo faggots will frantically attempt to persuade you that this arrangement is a comedic perfect work of art and a zenith of aesthetic accomplishment, however as the initial five minutes plainly build up, this couldn't possibly be more off-base. Fortunate Star is just progressive in how much it's ready to exhaust anybody that isn't a slobbering fuckstick with social uneasiness issue - you will really feel that this anime rose above existence to convey you a universe-breaking kick in the nuts, except if you discover Meet The Spartans type reference jokes amusing and clearly pre-pubescent anime young ladies hot, in which case you will love this show like the screwing failure you are. Many have contrasted this show with Seinfeld in light of the fact that the two offer an \"appear about-nothing\" way to deal with account narrating, however this is the place every single intelligent examination end. Seinfeld is a momentous TV arrangement about the funny adventures of a gathering of huge butt faces in New York. Fortunate Star is a show about the different non-episodes in the lives of a bundle of \"this-is-the thing that weeaboos-wish-young ladies were-like\" high schoolers that have dull-as-screw discussions, fit flawlessly inside buzzword prime examples while never advancing, and make a considerable measure of recoil commendable popular culture references. \\n\\n\r\nIn any case, unadulterated crappiness alone isn't sufficient to impel this anime to the absolute lowest grade status it's as of now at. What truly gets me about Lucky Star is exactly how much the \"FEED ME MORE MONEY\" state of mind of Kyoto Animation spills into the real creation. Each time I persevere through an agonizingly exhausting talk about some consistently life theme, another unfunny Lucky Channel drama, the clarification and, thus, ruination of what generally would've been an acceptable joke, or some reference to Haruhi/[insert computer game or potentially anime here] it takes me back to the real expected motivation behind this arrangement. The characters, circumstances, and jokes are altogether deliberately written to connect with close in goof balls who burn through the greater part of their lives watching anime, playing computer games, and posting on web message sheets. It's the hollowest anime I've ever watched; it callously and noxiously claims to individuals who are excessively regrettable, making it impossible to understand that they're being pandered to for money - in the event that you paid cash to perceive any piece of this show and AREN'T one of these individuals, you will leave the experience feeling like somebody shot you in the knees and continued to take your home, vehicle, personality, and spouse. It's an anime intended to be viewed among anime club gatherings rounded with individuals who compel out dry hurls of giggling so they can feel like they fit in with everybody around them, and on projector screens at anime traditions topped with oddities dressed off as creatures and Sailor Moon characters. This show was not made out of enthusiasm, or a general love for the medium, or a real conviction that the show would be clever, it was made to misuse the most minimized shared variable of anime fans for a fast buck. It's taking cash from individuals who don't have a clue about any better, it leaves a terrible preference for your mouth and removes any regard you might've had for anybody associated with making the arrangement. \\n\\n\r\nFortunate Star's specialty is sickeningly sweet moe-waste. For a studio that is unmistakably centered more around activity than story, the dimension of unremarkableness appeared here is unsuitable. At any rate when I watched that shitheap Haruhi Suzumiya I could compliment angles where unmistakably an exertion was made to create a quality item - here, we have a prime case of the new-age, gathering style craftsmanship that is tormenting current anime. With our tremendous favorable circumstances in innovation, one would believe that the apparently boundless conceivable outcomes would start amazing outcomes, and keeping in mind that we have seen looks of that (i.e. 2009's Summer Wars), the vast majority of what has won in the business has been streamlined, cleaned, and callous. \\n\\n\r\nI do need to give the anime props in the sound division, in any case. The OP is presumably the most captivating piece of the whole show, as each time you hear it you will be siphoned for what must be where the arrangement begins to get. Despite the fact that it never does, I can't blame the OP for giving us trust. The different EDs run the gauntlet as far as quality, yet by and large they're a decent split far from the mouth breathing elements that are the genuine show. Concerning the voice on-screen characters, they all came and turned out good exhibitions, giving the show somewhere around one endurable quality in the middle of credits. This is one of only a handful couple of anime that I viewed subbed in any case, so I have no clue if the American VAs are any great. \\n\\n\r\nThe way that individuals say they can identify with characters on this show is alarming. They truly sum to little moeballs loaded down with each conceivable secondary school young lady antique the scholars could uncover, and never create past that point. Konata, in any case, isn't just that, yet something a whole lot more terrible. While whatever remains of the characters try to engage the area of the anime advertise that grovels over clear charm, Konata is an intriguing take a gander at how far a movement studio will go to press cash out of otaku fucks. She was made exclusively so weeaboos would have somebody on the cast they could relate to, and keeping tuned in to Kyoto Animation's feeling of their watchers, she's agonizingly one-dimensional. Her pastimes incorporate computer games, anime, and being a bitch. That is it. Lamentably, very little else can be said in regards to whatever is left of their characters either. Miyuki is the acumen of the gathering, but at the same time she's moe. Tsukasa is the timid one, but on the other hand she's moe. Kagami is the searing tsundere, but on the other hand she's moe. In any event, when you give a one line portrayal of Seinfeld's characters, you're forgetting a considerable measure of character data. They may not so much change as time advances, yet you unquestionably take in significantly more about them. In Lucky Star, one line portrayals characterize our characters for the whole show. There's more character improvement on a scene of Cops than there is here. \\n\\n\r\nAs I achieved the finish of the last scene, I swung to my specialist who was, at that present minute, wailing into my shoulder because of sheer, free weariness. His red eyes gazed toward me and as I looked down at him with a blend of pity and regret, I could see his lips faintly murmur out \"spare me\". As the young ladies equipped their cheerleading execution of the opening melody, I could see his last hint of something to look forward to, of confidence in humankind, disappear from him and buoy towards the pit. \\n\\n\r\nHe figured he could spare me. \\n\\n\r\nI decline to trust that Kyoto Animation could, as they viewed over the arrangement for the last time before authoritatively discharging it, say with finish genuineness that this arrangement was worthy for open utilization as well as authentically pleasant. It's conceivable to savor a show's disagreeableness in case you're ready to regard the truthfulness of the general population that made it. It's the reason I adore motion pictures like The Room and Batman and Robin, and it's the reason I consider Mars Destruction has the right to be indicated daily on HBO. Notwithstanding, when something this terrible is in reality only a merciless joke to the detriment of a cluster of weeaboo faggots, the untruthfulness, all things considered, pollutes what could've quite recently been a regular awful show and transforms it into something dastardly and unlikeable. I don't think otaku understand that this show isn't really commending the things they neede",

            "content": "An eccentric show with high production values\r\nLucky Star is considered the holy grail for many hardcore Otaku people and it really is - which also makes it a \"love it or hate it\" show.  Being an avid enthusiast at best, I could appreciate how Lucky Star nails the intended market, while disliking the morals behind such a show.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nIn short, this is a gag-comedy show with a (rather twisted) school life genre.\r\nThe show follows the life of a dysfunctional otaku, Konata and her rather unplausible school life.  It is amazing how the producers managed to put the most mundane of conversations onto thescreen but it somehow works.  While the flow is hard to get for some (including myself), some subjects hit home for me such as the UFO catcher.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really brings this show to life is the very good interaction between the characters during the mundane conversations.  It is also amusing to see a show for otakus ridiculing otakus, which brings a sense of sanity exactly where needed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nA perfect example of KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid).  How much simpler does the art get?  With the advances in CGI, recent shows (especially KyoAni) have seen increased use of colours, shadings and usage of detail - the hair in AIR is a prime example.  Lucky Star is so amazingly and ridiculously simple that it is this simplicity which has made the art so catchy and unique.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I have mixed feelings at the loli-esque art (they look 12, not 17), it does accomplish its intended mission very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is as smooth and fluid as ever.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThis is a relatively simple, slow show where sound is not the most important thing, unlike Macross.  The BGM is as simple as the art and does the job.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme, as much as I dislike it is possibly the best track in the &quot;Drum Master&quot; game and has a good following among the die-hards.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThis is where the show shines.  Konata's family brings enjoyment (I can ridicule them to oblivion), and Kagami brings some balance and sanity into the show.  So much that for much of the show, my thoughts were in-line with Kagami whenever Konata went on her antics.  Konata and Kagami really are an excellent combination and some say opposites attract?\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast contained variety yet had a smooth flow so was good to watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nThe abundance of &quot;What the...&quot; moments, following Konata's train of thought gave enough entertainment, as well as her interaction with Kagami.  I also found the quirks of every character amusing.  While it was entertaining, I did not die from laughter however.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, I'm sure the show hits the intended market right on the spot.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nA &quot;good&quot; show which I found good fun out of and is unique.  If you're the kind of person who likes music which sounds like a CD skipping, except a hundred times faster, then you will love this show!",

Now yes, you could argue i've only seen one episode or that I don't like slice of life anime, but firstly: I could not stand to subject myself to any more of the inane story, horrible artwork, moronic character design and barely tolerable soundtrack; secondly, one of my favourite animes is Azumanga Daioh, so it's got nothing to do with slice of life.\r\nI have heard arguments that it improves after episode 4, but I can't bring myself to waste time watching something I hated on the offingwhen I could be doing something far more enjoyable like, oh, I don't know, contracting chronic diarreah. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime just outright sucks. The central character is an idiotic, arrogant, self-important Otaku who falls in with the crowd of Wesley from Star Trek: TNG or Excalibur in Soul Eater. The ancillary characters appear weak and ineffectual and of the clips I've seen from later episodes the only tolerable characters are those who rarely ever turn up. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I really don't care if people disagree with me, because my opinion is steadfast that Lucky Star is the manifestation of every kind of pain imaginable\\n\\n",

            "content": "Normally when I score story in a Slice of Life show, I do it based on all the episodic stories combined. But what happens when a show does not have that and is just pure life and is random with no coherent order/story. That is why I left the score a blank. \r\nBut I would still like to talk about the content. Lucky Star plays off its humor through normal everyday conversations. Talking about the most random things and finding humor out of it is tricky. Personally, I found most conversations hilarious because I enjoy the idea of everyday situations being made fun at.This type of humor is not for everybody and thus why this show can be a hit or miss.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect of this show is its use of references. A good amount of conversations play off such references. And they can go anywhere from other anime to current events. It went as far as to use an old commercial. One of the keys to be able to enjoy this anime is to be able to know the references. Watching as much anime as I do, I got most of them easily.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: Technically speaking, this is not KyoAni's best work. But the style and design works really well for this type of story. There are times where I felt that they were being very lazy and yet there were times I was marveled at the level of detail. Of course it is nowhere near the level of their other works such as Haruhi.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Voice - Everyone plays there roles really well. I was particularly impressed with Hirano Aya (voice of Konata). KyoAni really utilized her vocal range and made great situations out of it. \\n\\n\r\nMusic - To me, this is probably the weakest aspect of the show. The OP is indeed catchy but it can only be appealing for so long. And the \"different\" ED each week was a hit or miss. The only great part about it was the appearance of Minoru Shiraishi. Having him sing for the last part of the series was brilliant. Listening to him was a blast. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Perhaps the strongest aspect of the show. The cast of Lucky Star are great. The variety it has and the way they fit so well together really bring out the show. Whether you come to like this show or not, I believe there will be at least one character that you can't help but like. Rather than me telling you, I hope you go check out this show after reading this review and see for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment = My score on MAL (it is subjectively rated)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a very enjoyable show. But it is for those who are into those kinds of humor. It is not something I would recommend to everybody. I believe this show is one of those shows where it is a hit or miss.",

The main heroine is Konata Izumi, an athletic and intelligent girl who, despite these attributes, is not in a sports club, and her grades remain low. Her laziness at school is due to her love for anime and video games, and she is not interested in much else.\r\nPersonal Opinion\r\nSo I had heard of Lucky Star for quite a while actually.  I just wasn't sure what I should expect.  I mean it didn't have anythingextravagent, i mean some anime references here and there.\\n\r\nAnd then i saw the OP. And my life would never be the same.\\n\r\nSo if i were to ask for a plot, i would say that there isn't any.  Lucky Star is the anime equivalent of a sitcom.  Each episode has multiple short situations that leads to some witty comment or reference.\\n\\n\r\nNow knowing me, plot-development is a MAJOR aspect of my reviews.  So a show that doesn't have a plot will have a hard time to get a good review from me.  However... Not only did Lucky Star managed to garner a good review from me, but it also turned me into a hopless fanboy.\\n\r\nAt this moment i'm trying to learn the Lucky Star dance\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nThis is a series made of pure WIN\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to...\\n\r\n- The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\\n\r\nSame voice actors and there are plenty of Haruhi references in Lucky Star.  It's a running gag\\n\\n\r\n- Minami-Ke\\n\r\nHaven't reviewed Minami, but from what i've seen of it, it's quite similar to Lucky Star, as in sitcom like anime\\n\\n",

Most of all, I think of it as an unique storie. Why? Because there is no storie.\r\nMost animes wihout a storie are boring, and still they managed to get Lucky Star interesting, almost each episode worth watching.\r\nThe characters I gave a 10, something I almost never give. This is because each charactar has his or her own personality which you can like or hate. They can have conversations everyone has made already.I don't know the exact reason for liking this anime so much, maybe the recognation?\\n\\n\r\nDurings the series, there are added some other characters as well. Unforunatly, they all aren't as brilliant as the main-characters. But still they too have they're own personalities you can like or hate, so if you don't like the main-characters, there are still plenty of others.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\r\nThis is an outstanding anime, and from the one hand i regret there is (still) no second season. From the other hand, an other season would be useless. They all went to an other school, so you will miss some of the main characters.\\n\r\nThis was a great anime, but it will have to stick with just this one season.\\n",

It is because of her addiction to anime, mangas and video/online games.(The blue haired one at the picture)\r\n    * Hiragi Kagami- (Kato Emiri) Theolder fraternal twin of Tsukasa. She has high grades but cooking is her weakness. her twin sister Tsukasa often asks for her help on her assignments. She loves reading light novels.( The purple hair, the longer one on the pic)\\n\r\n    * Hiragi Tsukasa- (Fukuhara Kaori) The younger fraternal twin of Kagami. She is clumsy and always depend on her older twin sister. But despite her clumsiness and dependent, she is very friendly. 9The one with the shorter purple hair on the pic)\\n\r\n    * Takara Miyuki- (Endo Aya)-a young lady from a wealthy family who is beautiful, smart, and well-mannered. She always uses extremely polite Japanese, even when talking with her closest friends.\\n\\n\\n\r\nReview:\\n\r\n    let me go on with my own review since there really is not much to say about the synopsis.\\n\r\n    Well, it is from a 4 paneled manga. It portrays the life of normal gakkou shoujos. each episode are really random. It features other famous mangas and animes.\\n\r\n    For those who don't regularly watch animes and not really otakus, they totally won't be able to relate to this show but for otakus, well, this show has almost everything about them. This is their show.\\n\r\n    They talk about random stuffs for each episodes.Like foods, school, culture, ranging from everything to almost everything.\\n\r\n    What I don't like about this show was the food conversation they have at the beggining. It kinda felt misplaced. And what I like about this anime was the pinch of seriousness suddenly turning to a funny turn up because of Konata's humor.\\n\r\n     Another thing I liked about this anime was Konata's friendship with Kagami, Tsukasa ang Miyuki. They are really close despite their differences. Kagami, Tsukasa and Miyuki still treat Konata as a dear friend despite her huge difference with them.\\n\\n",

But at that time i had no clue what lucky star was or did I really watch that much anime to know anything about it. I just had the impression that it was just a bunch of cute girls dancing.\r\nThen a few years later when i got into watching anime i was looking through MAL and i came across Lucky Star and i instantly wasreminded of that opening dance sequence that i would see in those forum user's signatures. So i was all like HEY I REMEMBER THIS! So i decided to give it a shot. But before i even began to start watching it, I would approach a friend of mine and seek his opinion on the anime. During that time i just started to watch anime so i was not sure what was good or not and my friend told me that it was really boring and he only watched a total of 5 minutes of it then he decided to drop it. So for a while i decided not to watch it. Later on after watching more anime so i start to get a sense of what i like, i decided to try this anime knowing that my friend hates it. \\n\\n\r\nAND I AM REALLY FUCKING GLAD I DECIDED TO WATCH IT.\\n\\n\r\nI've always assumed that i would like what ever my friend likes since that seemed to be the case when i started out watching anime. But i have gained my independence in this. Basically i watch what i want. lol.\\n\\n\r\nANYHOW enough back story. REVIEW TIME!\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 9\\n\r\nEven though this anime supposedly has no freaking story, i find that to be the beauty of it. Just how the hell can an anime where there is no story be good? Well it is possible. \\n\r\nThe so called \"Story\" revolves around these 4 girls that just live their lives in high school. At first you might say \"What the hell? that sounds stupid\" but it is actually really really interesting , to me at least. Lucky Star is one of those shows that you either don't like or you love it. And i for one, loved it. \\n\r\nEven though it's just about cute girls doing cute things living their lives, there are actually a few touching moments in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nART: 9\\n\r\nKYOTO ANIMATION 'NUFF SAID!!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nHaha I am totally a fan boy of kyoani, but this type of animation is what kyoani is known for. The type of animation in Lucky Star is incredibly simple AND IT WORKS!\\n\\n\r\nI totally love the moe moe ness in this anime. This is probably the biggest selling point of the anime. THE EFFING MOE! But there are a lot of other enjoyable things about this other than its moe tastic animation.\\n\\n\r\nAt episode 10 we are introduced to the Anime Tenchou, and holy crap they really put a lot of effort into the animation. Once you watch it you would understand what i mean.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9\\n\r\nThe music in this anime is great. I am particularly quite fond of the track \"FUN FUN FUN DAYO\" which i plan to learn it on the piano so i can have my own FUN FUN FUN.\\n\\n\r\nI also really liked the ending karaoke segment. It is very amusing to see the character's seiyuu's sing other songs. Konata's (Hirano Aya) version of Cha la head cha la is just freaking hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nTHIS IS WHAT I LIKE MOST ABOUT LUCKY STAR!!!!\\n\\n\r\nIzumi Konata: This chick is f*cking funny. She is athletic yet hates it, she is really short and is an otaku. She lives with her dad which is okay with her playing Eroge's (PORN GAMES!) And to top it all she is so god damn moe.\\n\\n\r\nHiiragi Tsukasa: I have always compared these twins with the twins in Clannad. I mean seriously, they look the Effing same. EXCEPT i do not hate the short hair one this time around. God i really dislike Ryou Fujibayashi. ANYHOW...... Tsukasa is totally the cute but stupid kind of person. Kind of like Konata but she's more normal like.\\n\\n\r\nHiiragi Kagami: MAN OH MAN.  SHe is an awesome f*cking character. She is just like her alter ego Fujibayashi Kyou from Clannad, which is also my favorite chick from Clannad. She is the typical tsundere girl that tsukkomi's every single chance she gets. She is aggressive one of the bunch and seeing her when she's not is just absolutely great. \\n\\n\r\n(Just a random note, i really don't know why i prefer these typical tsundere girls in most of the animes with a lot to choose from, maybe i just like aggressive chicks with purple hair, cough* cough* Sasasegawa Sasami from Little Busters cough* cough*)\\n\\n\\n\r\nTakara Myuki: Although Mal states her as a main character i see her more as a support character. The amount of screen time that she gets compared to the other three is small. Probably like 50%. Her character is the that of a really intellectual high class like ojou sama that isn't a total bitch. She reminds me of Mugi-chan from K-On. same type of aura. It would be awesome if she got a lot more screen time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: 9\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. It is something i can keep on rewatching as much I want and not get bored of it. It is not one of those anime's where it is the best watching it the first time around, no. It is one of those anime's that you just sit back and relax and just enjoy the awesome nothingness that brings you a smile to your face. \\n\r\nThis is purely my perspective of this though. There is that phrase of \"maybe this isn't your cup of tea\" Well i don't really drink tea but i bet if this was turned into tea i would gladly say it is indeed my cup of tea.\\n\r\nSo if you like a story revolved around nothing and just like seeing a bunch of cute girls and a bunch of parodies than i am sure you would enjoy this anime. \\n\r\nIf not, well I can't do anything about it. \\n\\n\r\n~Til Next time,\\n\r\nTomislol",

            "content": "Lucky Star is one of those Anime that caught my attention as soon as I watched the many videos people have created on Youtube.  My expectations for this show weren't that great until I watched all 24 episodes;  I must say I'm impressed.  There doesn't need to be a story for someone to enjoy it.  Also, the ending theme is creative(even better after episode 12). :3\r\n-The art and animation are very well done, considering that it was done by Kyoto Animation.\r\n-The sound effects are good, designed to fit well with the animation.\r\n-Characters are introduced usually at the end of an episodethey come in at.\\n\\n\r\n-I enjoyed it alot, found it to be quite funny!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really like it.  While that may be the case, there will be people who will not understand the humor; its a hit-or-miss, either you like it or you don't.  I also recommend watching The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya before Lucky Star as it has alot of references from the Anime.  :)",

            "content": "Lucky Star is complete trash. And so am I.\r\nThis anime has no real story. No development. No drama. No real story. No fan-service. No stand-out features. No real story. And yet somehow this anime completely won me over.\r\nAs I said before, Lucky Star doesn't have a real story. If anything, I would describe it as a \"character driven narrative\" or something along those lines. It follows the everyday lives of a group of high school girls doing what high school girls do, like debating on how to eat food, making Haruhi references, and spending every chance you can playing MMO's with your teacher and copyinghomework off of your conveniently smart friend. Yes, Lucky Star might not be anything like how real Japanese school girls act, but it's the unusual conversations that these girls have that make it so bloody entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOh, did I mention this is a parody? I probably should have, because that's one of the main appeals of this show. I don't think you can truly appreciate Lucky Star unless you've watched a fair amount of anime. Seriously, I swear there's got to be at least 10 references in each episode. It's both hilarious and annoying. Hilarious if you get the reference. Annoying if you don't.\\n\\n\r\nI said at the begin that this would be considered a \"character driven narrative\" in my perspective. Well, what I meant by that was that the characters are literally the entire show. From the mega-otaku, Konata, to the genius airhead, Miyuki, there's definitely a loli or two in here to suit everyone's taste.\\n\\n\r\nOne final thing I wanted to mention was Lucky Channel. At the end of every episode, there's a fourth wall breaking additional show segment featuring Kogami Akira and her loyal assistant, Shiraishi Minoru. I won't spoil anything, but the way that LC builds up over time is pure genius and makes me laugh every time. Definitely one of the highlights of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Lucky Star is a fantastic anime with a loveable cast of colourful characters and some of the funniest moments in all of anime. It's definitely worth a watch if you're into the slice of life genre or if you're just looking for a good time.\\n\\n\r\nHope that helped.",

            "content": "Wow well this is a tough one. You know this is one of those animes which either you hate it or you love it.\r\nWhen I started watching this anime I was new to the whole anime fiasco. I had not seen The melancholy of Haruhi Suzumia (a must see before this anime) or actually a lot of the animes that are referred in the show which in the end make me think that this is a boring slice of life anime with no comedy, no character development and with bad art style (boy was I wrong).\r\nA year after my initial view of the show (Idropped it on episode 5 or 6 i think) I said to myself that I will watch it to the end and that every anime at least deserves to be re seen a second time to analyses what actually is bad in it. So I watched the first 12 episodes and I found myself unable to stop laughing so I continued to watch it and actually finished the anime in one sitting. It was that good now. I now started to see the humor in this anime was - the characters that I said were shabby and non developed suddenly started to be funny and interesting. Each and every character was likable and the best part is that I started to make connections with my friends and the character from the anime (and I think that this is a really big + to a slice of life anime).\\n\\n\r\nWell it is absolutely hard to recommend this anime because like I said this anime will most certainly not appeal to everyone's taste but it has potential. The music is good in the anime, especially the bloody opening... I still have it stuck in my head and it has been a long time since I saw this anime for the last time.\\n\r\nThe story is lacking a little bit because there isn`t an actual story right up to the end, but that is it`s charm that it takes everything lightly including it`s story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art well let`s face it, it isn`t that good (my first reaction was THIS IS HORRIBLE to be honest with you), but again it gives the anime it`s personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are lovable ( heck because of the main character I now write smiles like this :3 because they remind me of how funny she was). Well the anime tries to develop some specific and actually stereotypical character traits seen in the slice of life genre. For example we have the tsundere, the moe, the airhead and of course the die hard comedian type character (oh my sweet sweet Konata.)\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap this up. The anime is a parody/slice of life anime. It has it`s ups and downs. You need to watch a few other animes before this one like \"The melancholy of Haruhi Suzumia\" so that you can understand how brilliant  the humor in this anime is. I will recommend this anime, but be warned that I don't guaranty a 100% satisfaction from the first time you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nI will paraphrase a funny line that the dubbed Naruto says a lot and is actually relevant for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nBelieve in it :3\\n\r\n                                                                                           Enjoy the show - Gary",

            "content": "Four friends in a high school hang out with each other and chat about things with their other girlfriends. Most notable among them is Konata Izumi, a video game / anime fanatic who's actually pretty smart and athletic, but doesn't like sports or putting effort into her schoolwork. Her other friends include twin sisters Kagami and Tsukasa and the pretty, smart, but also clumsy Miyuki.\r\nAnd then there's Lucky Channel. Shown at the end of every episode before the ending theme, it's a mini-segment that stars washed-up idol Akira Kogami and her assistant, Minoru Shirashi, voiced and modeled after his actor. Their main goal is totalk about the series, including its cast, at first, but eventually it turns into a look into Akira's unhappy career and her wanting to be in the main series, as well as focusing on her less-than-stellar relationship with Minoru. Unlike the rest of the series, the Lucky Channel segment does have a (loose) plot of sorts, so if you plan to skim around the series, make sure you avoid these segments lest you get confused. That's not a spoiler, right? God I suck at these reviews. that's right i said i suck at it thus compliment me on how great I am at life. No one cares? Well let's get on with the review.\\n\\n\r\nKonata Izumi, the main protagonist, has a fetish for chocolate cornets, as well as a number of anime and manga shows that are also popular. Not surprisingly, she is an avid follower of Haruhi Suzumiya (the seiyuu of both characters is Aya Hirano), and you also have plenty of other anime and manga references. And in spite all her bubblyness, and the catlike smile she loves to sport, she has skeletons in the closet, too: her mother died when she was young. She is a \"Jill of all trades,\" the renaissance girl, and the otaku, all in one.\\n\\n\r\nKagami Hiiragi is the tsundere-type of girl in this series, and a popular girl in her class. Aesthetically, she is an interesting person to pay attention to, more so than her sister Tsukasa, although there are attributes that make her unique. Miyuki Takara is your meganekko in the show, and after Konata talks with her about what her weaknesses are, she sees her in the moekko mold. The supporting characters have their unique quirks: Yui Narumi, Konata's cousin, and her teacher, Nanako Kuroi, are akin to Yukari Tanizaki and Minamo Kurosawa in AzuDai. \\n\\n\r\nSome other well known characters outside of Lucky Star even cameo in the series, like Sergeant Frog. I feel it may take away from the story, but these guest stars add another dimension to this sitcom of a series. Lucky Star can also be thought of as a sitcom in a way, a situational comedy with punchlines at every twist and turn.\\n\\n\r\nThe story plot, which is weak, is strengthened with the characters, who reflect different personalities and persuasions. It's a pretty decent balance.\\n\\n\r\nSo we talked about the characters in the series for quite a while. How are the actual jokes in this series, you might wonder? Well, due to the series' long length, there are just as many hits as misses, if not more so the latter. Many of Lucky Star's jokes fall into two realms: everyday Japanese life, and media references. I counted at least three jokes that had to do with Aya Hirano herself.These jokes wouldn't be too bad in small doses, or if they were consistent, but often you have a typical, reference-free episode and then are suddenly hit with a bunch of them. You can still enjoy the series well enough without getting them all, but you'll lose a part of the reason to watch the series if you do. I'm not familiar with the manga, so I'm not sure if they name-drop references as often as the anime, but if they do I doubt it's as hard.\\n\\n\r\nThe situational music is perhaps the down side because it isn't even necessary for most scenarios. I personally believe that it doesn't need it. The background music from other series in Lucky Star, such as \"Hare Hare Yukai\" when Konata plays on a taiko simulator, or Aya Hirano's \"God knows...\" during a concert that the girls watch, is acceptable, but the original situational music could be best dealt without.\\n\\n\r\nThere is good stuff in Lucky Star, but it\u2019s overwhelmed by so much mediocrity. There was a section towards the end of the series where I hadn't laughed for several consecutive episodes, and was ready to write this off as another \u201coverstayed its welcome\u201d comedy, but the last two episodes were among the most entertaining of the series. Everyone is going to react slightly differently to this series, as evidenced by the wide range of responses to it.\\n\\n\r\nSo re you an otaku who wants to have a perfect otaku girlfriend? I PRESENT Izumi Konata. But since I'm a NonOtaku I'll just walk away. Alone. Sadlife .\\n",

            "content": "\"Love it or hate it.\" If there is any anime where this saying is valid, it is Lucky Star. I've never seen anyone who said: \"Lucky Star was ok but nothing special.\"\r\nAs for the story - it is non existent. The characters in Lucky Star go to school, meet up in their free time and talk about random things. A friend of mine called Lucky Star \"a show of utterly randomness\" - and well .... that sentence just describes it.\r\nThe character design is cute but a bit simple. Anyways the art is good and it really fits the show so there is nothing to complain.\r\nWith\"Motteke! Sailor Fuku\" Lucky Star has a catchy opening song with a dance in the opening video which I think tries to copy the success of Hare Hare Yukai - the ending of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. As for the BGM there is not much to say. It's nothing special but fits the atmosphere of the anime but nothing you really keep in mind. As for the ending songs KyoAni did something rather unusual for an anime. Every episode has it's own ending song. The first 12 ending songs are songs the 4 main characters sing in a karaoke bar - and it really sounds like high school students who are not good at singing trying to do their best. Especially Konata's (voiced boy Hirano Aya) songs are quite unique but not everyone likes them. As for the other 12 endings, 11 are sung by Shiraishi Minoru and also really unique in their own way, the last one was sung by Hiromi Konno, the VA of Akira and just regarding the singing.\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting itself, the seiyuus did a great job. Especially Hirano Aya did a great job at voicing Konata and you can see her great talent when she imidiately switches her voice from the Konata voice to her Haruhi voice (the one you hear in the other animes she voiced) and back again. As for the other characters KyoAni took a good mix of well known seiyuus and some less known. Especially Shiraishi Minoru (who voiced himself) and Sasaki Nozomi who voiced Patricia Martin did good jobs.\\n\\n\r\nWhen a series doesn't really have a story it needs something other to be successfull. In Lucky Star's case it are imho the characters. Lucky Star has quite a couple of important characters. There are Konata - an overall hardcore female otaku, Kagami who is supposed to be her tsundere counterpart, Tsukasa who is Kagami's a bit air-headed twin sister and Miyuki the rich and smart girl who combines a number of \"moe-aspects\" such as being a dojikko meganekko who is afraid of dentists.\\n\r\nThe last few minutes of each episode are filled with the \"Lucky Channel\" where Kogami Akira (a loli idol) and above mentioned Shiraishi Minoru who is a newbie-voice actor have some kind of talk show.\\n\r\nIn the later episodes of Lucky Star there are some more characters introduced with Konata's cousin Yutaka at the centre.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching Lucky Star but it took some time to get through to it. Especially the very first episode is hard to watch when you don't know what to expect and the girls talk 8 minutes about how to eat a choco cornet and wether the thin or the fat end is the head of it and why they think it is. After a few episodes KyoAni changed the director of Lucky Star and it's more easy to watch. Lucky Star is full of references to other anime and especially to the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya - they even overdid it somehow with the Haruhi references - even every character of the SOS Brigade had a little cameo in Lucky Star but on the other hand it's quite obvious why they did it since Haruhi and Lucky Star are both from Kyoto Animation and the main character is voiced by the same seiyuu. Nonetheless watching Lucky Star is much fun, especially when you know a couple of the animes which are parodied.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Lucky Star is a great slice-of-life commedy anime for experienced watchers since it's a bit difficult to follow an anime with a negliable plot (girls going to school - not more not less) and lots of references to other anime, video games, shampoo advertises and japanese TV shows. I highly recommend to watch a couple of animes before starting with Lucky Star, otherwise you don't understand more than half of the gags told in Lucky Star. Experienced watchers should have much fun with all those references and the way the gags are told. As said in the beginning \"Love it or hate it\" there is nothing between those two options.",

The art made it look interesting, but it soon gets annoying. I don't like this show, at all, and I blame MAL ratings which made me think this would be a great show.\r\nSo basically, this show is about \"the daily life of 4 high school girls\" and yes exactly that. They just walk around chit-chat/dance/joke trying to make funny shit happen, but it's like \"HOW IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY YOU MOTHE-*\" The first quotedsentence summarizes the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is supposed to be a comedy. But the comedy sucked, hardcore bish. Hardcore. Most of the comedy is based around Japanese video games and Japanese jokes. Sori I no undrstandi un japanise stufz. Therefore those jokes are worthless, making me do a WTFface. Not once did I laugh from this show. Ok I have to admit... I smiled and sort of laughed when it ended.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was alright. Which is the only good thing in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters... I've seen pretty much the same personality types in other anime. One's into food,anime,games and will one day become a fatass. One looks prettier than the others with her wig on(It's true I tell you!). One with anger issues, and sucks at chores. And of course! Who could forget, the N3Rd with glasses. -No offence to any real person-\\n\\n\r\nLucky \u2606 Star definitely, does not deserve this high of a ranking.\\n\r\nIt\\n\\n\r\nS\\n\r\nU\\n\r\nC\\n\r\nK\\n\r\nS \\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you feel hatred against me for typing this review, please feel free to rage at my profile comment wall. \\n\r\nIn Soviet Russia, Lucky Star is a funny show.",

            "content": "It is MAL's 15th most-popular Anime. Created by the same people who brought you Haruhi, tt is one of the most watchable animes regardless of age and it's (In this reviewer's own opinion), one of the most loveable animes around today. Lucky Star is an international phenomenon, following the lives of 4 very simple High-School girls as they make their way through High-School. The Anime prides itself on being a slow, laid-back comedy with hints of some fast-paced action dotted at points around the Anime itself. So let's review it shall we??\r\n--STORY--\r\nA big, fairly important part in any form of Media. The story in Lucky-Star,sort-of follows a fairly non-linear progression, and although most episodes themselves do not progress the story any further, there are key moments when you know you are stepping steppings forwards through school. Most School-based Animes will contain really obscure, and skimpily-dressed classmates, however this was not the case. Unless a background character has a specific role or reason to be seen, it will remain a generic bluish-blob, that just mindlessly does stuff. The story-arc is non-existent, with no specific actions from one episode affecting another directly, which shows that this Anime is about...school. It should be said that all events that fill the episode are filled with comedic gold and humour that you can only wish existed in today's TV Shows. It is witty, funny and sometimes, just outrageous. At the end of every episode, there is a 4-minute spot called Lucky Channel which stars 2 other characters ( Akira and  Shiraishi) who simply either talk about the occurences within that day's episode, or more often then not, end up fighting as Akira's true self is a worn-out, angry Idol and Shiraishi, is the 'new flavour', whom Akira feels threatened by. There is also an immensly strong connection between this Anime's older sister, Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu and this becomes immediatly apparent via all of the advertising, and references to the series, including a Cosplay Cafe where Konata works. Following the story was a real treat, and come the final episode, you really do feel relieved, and in a sort-of up-tempo mood, seeing how they ended their final year of school.\\n\\n\r\nThe 4 main characters vary greatly between each-other. The twin-sisters Kagami and Tsukasa Higari are both normal girls, but a major difference is, Kagami is a brilliant student although perhaps a little boring, and Tsukasa, not-so, tending to take on the roles of baking, and dreaming big. The Haruhi-rule applies in this anime too, so there is obviously a Moe girl with large-breasts. This gives us Takara Miyuki, a pink-haired beauty, descended from a rich family. The main character is especially interesting, because she embodies all the things an Otaku loves (Like playing Ero-Games to watching Anime and reading Manga) into the body of a short, blue-haired girl named Konata Izumi. This combination of unlikely friends makes a very interesting turn of events, with Konata making obscure references to Animes at all the right times. There are also some other, soon-to-be main characters, but they do not start making appearences until the 2nd half of the series. One character I did like alot was Kusakabe Misou, a hot-headed friend and classmate of Kagami who is just cute, and has an odd sense of humour, bluntly pointing out that Kagami is scary.\\n\\n\r\n--ARTWOOK/ANIMATION--\\n\r\nAs a general rule-of-thumb, the artwook is really nice, but then again, feels very plain. There are no overly-drawn, or overly detailed characters or surroundings unlike most Action animes. Being a comedy, it can sort-of get away with this fact, and seeing as how it knows it is not detailed and doens't try too hard, it sort of is acceptable. As stated above, any characters not deemed important to the scene, are just made into Generic blobs which allows you focus much easier on the characters portrayed in the scene and not the background. Throughout a few episodes in the Anime, there stars a very overly-animated Anime-Store Manager and his band of shop-assistants who provide some Action at short intervals (Far and wide between the story) in trying to get Konata to buy stuff from his store. The animation itself, isn't actually that grand (Except for the Anime Store's needlesly volitile staff scenes) and just trys to get by, by only moving mouths, eyes and perhaps hands if need-be. Granted, there are some walking scenes etc. but most of the time, the girls mainly sit around somewhere, talk, or do stuff, and then talk.\\n\\n\r\n--SOUND/MUSIC--\\n\r\nThe first thing you should ever note about this series, is the Opening song. Motteke! Sailor Fuku is one of the most popular songs ever to be included on an Anime, reaching almost the same levels of super stardom as the ED theme of this Anime's predessecor. It is a lovely opening staring the main characters singing a Cheerleader's chant about how they want their Summer-Uniform back :) Throughout the Anime, the music-style generally do not change, keeping their slow-styled, almost elevator-like music. Now even this music can vary and they have produced several variences to all of Lucky-Star's songs and they are used fully and well, to create a great atmosphere each and every time. Like the rare action-sequences, there is also a small selection of action-music within the anime, used within these rare scenes. They generally parody some other Anime at this time, so I can't say much for the music-direction here, except that they do fit-in rather well. There is no, one ED song and instead, it is usually just the Main-Characters at a Kareoke Bar, singing a song of some kind. In the 2nd half of the series, the man who plays Shiriashi within Lucky Channel is seen in real-life, usually singing a theme from another Anime.\\n\\n\r\n--ENJOYMENT/OVERALL--\\n\r\nThis is, and still remains to be one of my most favorite Animes, and this is proven by the fact that every day, I usually re-watch at least one of the episodes, just because the story is non-linear and allows for you to pick up at any point, and not have to worry about what happened last episode. I also just love Konata's obssessive need to relate everything to an Anime or a Manga title, even when talking about Light-Novels. Basically, to sum up, you just have to watch it, otherwise, your life may go unfulfilled :3\\n\r\n-Aex",

The setting was very becoming for the kind of dialogue the series seemed to be going for.. Kona-chan just stole the show with her lazy attitude and odd characteristics. The other characters function strongly in support roles but unfortunately they just fall short of the charm/wit of kona-chan in earlier episodes. The only other thing I really had a problem with is that as the series wears on the dialouge turns moretwards demographic and otaku refrences, which since I am niether. confused me and pretty consistantly took me out of the dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nbut all in all it IS very charming and sly. With some moods toned down at times only to accentuate them later in other parts in the episode. The whole thing can some off very clever and meaningful at times. while at others delivering fan service and dropping more Japanese pop culture references than you could shake a stick at.\\n\\n\r\nSo I concur with the other reviewers, \\n\r\nGreat.\\n\r\nJust not for everyone",

            "content": "Before I say anything, listen all you people planing/considering to watch Lucky Star, this is an anime for people who like random things and can basically laugh at anything even to the people of talking to themselves out loud discussing what they think is going to happen next. If you are a serious person who never laughs or thinks everything has to be perfect this is not the anime for you.\r\nAt first I thought it would be one of those boring \"high-school-girls-talk-about-guys\" show. But after watching the first episode, the first thing that came to my mind was...RANDOM! I find it amazing how they canhave such a random show, and yet make it so awesome! \\n\\n\r\nI could relate to most of the characters, especially Izumi Konato as I too am an anime fan and have problems laying off it to do homework. It is definatly not your typical slice-of life sort of anime. It is BEYOND ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nI couldn't give it full marks for story because well, there is no story line. Unlike some slice of life animes, this one doesn't have a storyline, but hey think about it, how much story is actually in you life? Go to school/work, play computer games, eat, sleep and if your a good student (which I am not) you would do your homework, not much of a life story is it. But this anime could use that random stuff and yet still make it interesting which I believe it really deserves credit for.\\n\\n\r\nThe art. Sure for as seventeen year old, they sure look ten, absolute unrealistic, but this is anime. How realistic are anime characters with pink and blue hair running around shooting laser beams out of their six arms? If you ask me I find the drawing style rather cute. It doesn't matter if they don't look their age, its anime for heavens sake.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening isn't exactly the best song I've ever heard in the world, the first four episodes I found it increadibly gay in fact. But later on, it was really catchy and before you know it, it became my ringtone. I am the sort of person with no paitence, I like to skip the openings and endings and only watch the actual content, but I could not bring myself to skip Lucky Stars opening because it was super super catchy. Though I have to admit, I still skip the ending including Lucky Channel.\\n\\n\r\nHow are the characters not likeable? I mean, their so random and absolutely human. Full of flaws. Unlike most animes which make you want to be like them because they are so perfect, this one makes you laugh at their flaws and think, I am kinda like that too LOL. Izumi is my favourite cause we both love anime, she is absolutely random and can only think about anime, manga and computer games and only after than can she even be bothered, and if at all, to copy homework. The Lucky Star characters are more human with all their flaws, and make you feel better, people often compare themselves with anime characters and then just laugh it off saying &quot;their is no way i can be as perfect and that.&quot; But in Lucky Star you think &quot;Oh, that is just like me, now that I think about it, its time to call Melissa about tomorrows maths homework.&quot; I am sure most people that watch this can at least relate to one of the characters if not more.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment TEN!!!",

Great voicing and art on characters too.\r\nHumour depends on you.  To me, it is hilarious and I was bursting in laughter the first time I watch it, but know that it is a slow paced slice of life anime (nothing is gonna happen) and some jokes required further knowledge as they keepalluding to haruhi, otaku culture and other japanese stuff.  Having watched it before I watched Haruhi, I had to go back and rewatch to get some jokes.  Other times it has subtle humour, so ppl with no patience should not watch.  I still remember how it trolled me with the food discussion. wont say anymore.\\n\\n\r\nIt is 100% clean.  If I remember right there is no sexual stuff hinted at all. It manages to make a scene with a bunch of naked characters in spa completely clean.  I like it that way as it has chosen strictly to adhere to its own style of humour.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr =  try watching one ep. If you like it then continue.

While the anime does not offer much in the story category, it does offer the viewer a chance to put the idea of needing a strong story aside and allows us to watch the everyday lives of four highschool girls unfold. \r\nWhile this anime may not be for every type of anime fan and that is very understandable, but if you are one of those anime fans who dislike this genre of anime.. is it a bad thing to being risky every nowand then? Being out of your comfort zone might sound like a bad thing, but there are occasions when you just may end up liking a show that you once thought you would not.\\n\\n\r\nAnime like Kiniro Mosaic and A Channel are alright and offers the viewer the same type of experience, but Lucky Star is so incredibly clever that IMO puts this anime on a higher plane than the other two. The obvious best friend relationship that Konata Izumi and Kagami Hiiragi is a perfect example of how clever this anime can get and always seems to put a smile on my face which is something great about anime. Some anime make you sad and others make you scream, but Lucky Star gives you the opposite experience! \\n\\n\r\nLucky Star is slowly nearing its seventh birthday and year after year seems to stem more haters, but more fans.

            "content": "Lucky Star is a very fun and creative depiction of the life of high school girls, mainly the characters Konata, Kagami, Tsukasa and Miyuki. It's nothing much but just normal chitchats between these girls and other people they're related to, but it's not at all boring. Every conversation is filled with fun and interesting topics where anyone can usually relate with. Definitely a MUST WATCH for good laughs on the simple things.\r\nIt doesn't have much of a story, but the characters talk about some really good and funny stories about their life experiences. The best story I heard in this show is about the parentsof Konata.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, as what one can expect from Kyoto animation, is great! Everything looks nice and cute, and everything is animated well. They ran out of ideas on some things though and decided to recycle some stuff for some scene layouts.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds are really good. The background suits every scene and the voices of the main cast are nice. The OP song is so good that people won't get tired of it even on the last episode. Also, the idea of having no ED was good. They just put on random, usually good stuff for the ED. Usually good because not all of the ED was interesting. Another sound problem is the use of a weird voice for some extra female characters. People will hear the same voice for those extras which is not good at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe character department is the best. Lucky Star has a wide variety of excellent characters. Everyone is so fun and so natural. A very outstanding cast.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is very enjoyable! Well the never ending conversations can be a little bit tiresome sometimes, but everything they talk about is interesting. It also has its really fun points like when they copy Initial D and when they visit Konata at her part time job. Many more can be seen and enjoyed in this show that's why it is considered one of the best.",

            "content": "First off, yes, this show has a reputation. And some people might hate it just because of that. But really it does live up to it's reputation.\r\nSecondly, this is only my first review, so I hope I can manage to actually do a good job. If I'm confident in this review, I might just go on to write a few more.\r\nPreface extended:\r\nAs another part of my preface, I'll go into my motto than an anime has to do something well to be a good anime. And if it does something really well, it's enough to be called a masterpiece. Now the more genres somethingdoes right, then the more the merrier. But it only takes one. \\n\\n\r\nAnd this show does that one thing really well. \\n\\n\r\nNow I'm not one of those people who goes around saying every genre of music has good music which I don't. And music and anime taste is subjective anyway. But for my own person tastes, and person feeling that every genre of anime has something to give, I felt a great deal of pleasure out of the elements this anime used. And has near single handedly shifted my anime fandom farther away from psychological and action anime which I used to be, and further towards comedy partialism.\\n\\n\r\nI would hope to assume other people could share some of these same tastes. That's the point of a review is it not? I can only be subjective, not objective. This is art after all. But I will try my best.\\n\\n\r\nFor those of you who do not want to hear my rambling about good and bad, and the subjectivity and objectivity of art, skip the spoiler and start reading here.\\n\\n\r\n1. Story.\\n\r\nI think this, like the other aspects of the show deserve a ten. I doesn't have anything complicated and intertwined deeply, no plot twists, no story hardly even. It's just an episodic slice of life anime. But it doesn't need it. And I love deep psychological story heavy anime. The pacing of this show and general fun is unparalleled hardly. Every scene of this this show basically stands on it's own as a good piece of anime work. Every little piece has been something I would want to watch several times, and often have since youtube, niconicodouga, and other sites have decided to break up scenes and mess with them.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a loveable, school based, otaku oriented school based story. It's nothing more, nothing less. It needs no more because randomness is part of the charm. It's fun because you just sit back and go along for the ride.\\n\\n\r\nThis show most deeply of any subjects, centers around otakudom. Now it's not uncommon for shows to do this. This show can also be slightly caustic and biting about it as well at times. Which is not uncommon in anime either. But never outside of the realm that it stops being fun at good natured. A thing that a lot of anime shows do not know when to stay within the realm of. Lucky Star allows you to think about being an otaku, without feeling bad.\\n\\n\r\nI really wish I could go into more, but I'm rambling. In short, it's just pure fun. And in opinion, you just about have to have a broken fun gene to not like this anime.\\n\\n\r\n2. Art.\\n\r\nYou know when looking at a couple screenshots I made of this anime, it almost looked MSPainish. Meaning it looks like it could have been drawn in MSPaint. But it's every bit as brilliant as any anime artwork. You know back in days past, I used to think that maybe anime wasn't meant for MSPaint and CG and other computer related art making, because all the things I can saw at my local stores that used either one, looked nothing like anything that was anime or even could be anime. But I've learned otherwise, it's just that unfortunately the style that I love had not taken off in the United States then. And to make it to my point instead of rambling, is everything that the anime art style is.\\n\\n\r\nIt's MOE. It was designed to be moe. The characters are chibi looking, they have big eyes, unusual hair colors. Nothing out of the ordinary here, but Lucky Star does that art work really well. There's something almost iconic in it. As if to be some kind of mascot for moe. It's got some of the simple stuff that's not hard animation involved, such as exaggerated motions and puffs of smoke. But I don't know who you are and what you know about frame rates and whatever, but the character designs while chibified and such, are not lacking any shading they should, and everything I have found about the animation was to be smooth and superb. I have no complaints whatsoever about the artwork.\\n\\n\r\n3. Sound.\\n\r\nWell...there's not much to go into for the sound. Which is good because this review is probably getting to be too long. There's nothing particularly epic or specially about the soundtrack. But it's cute and perfectly fitting, however simple. And the opening thing is downright famous. And for a reason, it's a simply genius bit of music. I've listened to the original and the remixes alike many hundreds of times throughout my life. And I'm sure to hit the thousands mark someday.\\n\\n\r\nActually, that was just the music I was thinking of. I forget that this is sound and not music rating. Well then it's time to go into voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nThe voices fit the characters in pretty much every way. And I only say pretty much because I'm in the habit of saying pretty much no matter what I'm saying. The voices absolutely fit in every way. From Konata's tomboyish otaku moe, to Kagami's tsundere moe, to every single side character. It's a cute overload. And that's why it's moe. And if you think it has any connecting with association with the artwork, just go listen to Konata's rendition of Cha-La Head Cha-La without any picture. You might be so overloaded with moe that you might faint and overdose.\\n\\n\r\n4. Character.\\n\r\nIt's a simple school life story, centered around a lovable otaku who the audience is set to agree with or relate to to some degree. She's you, the anime fan, especially if you're a big anime fan. If you're a girl, you'll probably relate to her, if you're a guy, you'll probably think she's your dream girl. That's the way she was designed and she makes and outstanding main character.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, they purposely got every anime character stereotype the could and played them out in various characters. And they did it in such a very charming spot on fashion, that it's just pure fun to watch these different archetypes play out and socially interact with each other in the same school.\\n\\n\r\nEven the foreigner Patricia Martin, who plays out every single stereotype of Anime Otaku foreigners(and I mean every) is portrayed in only a positive light. It's almost like a fanservice to us this time. Japan is obviously growing more and more aware of it's otaku fanbase abroad.\\n\\n\r\n5. Enjoyment.\\n\r\nWell I think that what pretty much covered so far, winds around what really motivates this show to be good. It doesn't have a complicated story. It doesn't have an epic soundtrack. It doesn't even have the most heavily shaded characters I've ever seen. But what it does have, makes all those other things pure 10's. And that's enjoyment. They all spiral toward one piece of pure fun in which every little piece of this show stands on it's own of fun. This is a show I will gladly watch several times throughout my lifetime and it will never get old.\\n\\n\r\n6. Overall.\\n\r\nWell, I already sort of went into why everything in it tied into enjoyment. Or that enjoyment was the driving force. But allow me to ramble further. Some things get attention they don't deserve. Some things that are great go unnoticed. But Lucky Star is neither of these. It's a great anime that everyone knows about and actually deserved the attention.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think I could criticize any one aspect of this show. Not one episode, not one scene. It is a masterpiece. It is a timeless classic. It deserves respect and reverence.",

The creators have so many references and jokes that you are bound to laugh at some if not all.\r\nArt:\r\nTruthfully the drawing was very simplebut that is what makes this show enjoyable to watch.

            "content": "This series seems to inspire a great deal of controversy and disagreement.  Some love it, while others detest it.  It is funny that such an easygoing, lighthearted series would spawn such a range of reactions.  There are plenty of reviews out there, but despite this, I decided to add yet another.\r\nI can see why this series would not appeal to everybody.  It has no overall story, and even the individual episodes have little, if any, plot.  The main portion of each episode consists of short snippets of the lives of the girls.  The humor is not the sort thatprovokes roaring laughter; for me, it seldom provokes more than a smile.  This series has numerous references to manga, anime, and other aspects of popular culture.  I certainly don't get all of them, and some of the humor might seem funnier to those who get most of the references.  Still, it is often clear from the context what type of anime (or other cultural product) the reference suggests.  The lack of plot and the relatively light humor aren't weaknesses; these characteristics are essential to the general atmosphere of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is driven entirely by the characters and the situations.  The first few episodes are a bit slow to get going; it takes time to introduce the characters, and it takes time for the audience to become familiar with them.  At first, I found the series a little dull, but I decided to be patient with it and see where it would lead me, and before long, I found myself sucked into it, identifying with some of the characters and enjoying its simple, relaxing atmosphere.  The art is stylistically appropriate to the series; the characters are simply drawn, and (as I'm sure everybody expects) ridiculously cute.  The backgrounds are nicely detailed.  The music within each episode is mostly simple and understated, tuneless tunes that are designed to build up the atmosphere and not get in the way of the dialogue - again appropriate to the series.\\n\\n\r\nA series like this needs good characters, and \"Lucky Star\" has them.  Once the characters are sufficiently introduced, there isn't a great deal of development, but in a series without a plot, traditional development isn't likely to happen and wouldn't be appropriate anyway.  Out of the group of main characters, Konata and Kagami have the strongest personalities, and I identify closely with both of them; perhaps this is the primary reason why I enjoyed the series.  Konata is a seemingly exaggerated otaku.  However, she isn't as exaggerated as some may think; I have known many people with severe otaku-like obsessions, and I have such tendencies myself.  She seems perfectly believable.  Kagami is a serious girl, devoted to her studies but willing to have fun when the work is done.  She is a tsundere, albeit a rather moderate one.  The light conflict between these two is a recurring theme in the series.  I feel like both characters live within me; my inner Kagami wants me to take the practical aspects of life more seriously, while my inner Konata wants to write a review of \"Lucky Star\" on this website.  Perhaps many anime fans have such an inner conflict, and they can identify with these two characters and the humorous situations that arise from their interactions.  The other characters are more typical, and some of the supporting characters are comic exaggerations.  They add to the atmosphere and add variety to the situations, but Kagami and Konata steal the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe \"Lucky Channel\" segments at the end contrast with the main program.  The humor is darker and more in-your-face, and the sense of parody is strong.  Akira is a parody of the typical temperamental celebrity, and she allows her bad temper to come out during these segments.  Her cute, cheery, and annoying high-pitched voice is an act; in reality, she is a bitch.  I suppose this is a parody of the idol culture in Japan, but it could easily apply to temperamental Hollywood actresses or even opera singers dating back to the seventeenth century, so it has universal appeal.  I enjoy how Akira's bad temper develops and blows up over the course of the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I came to enjoy this series considerably even though it had a rough start.  It is a lighthearted, random, dialogue-based slice-of-life comedy, and it doesn't try to be anything else.  Perhaps some who don't like it either don't like this style or want it to be something else.  It certainly isn't for everyone, and I can see how some people would find it boring, but those who like random everyday situations and light humor with a simple, relaxing atmosphere might want to give it a try.\\n",

            "content": "Lucky Star is a kind of show that half of people would love, and the other half would purely hate. \r\nThere is basically no story which makes this anime, well, should I say different. It really depends on the person. Since I was a little kid I always loved those \"Slice of Life\" shows.  The \"story\" is basically the life of Konata Izumi (the main charcter on my opinion) and her three friends: Miyuki, Kagami and Tsukasa. \r\nThe girls get on with their ordinary every-day lives, sometimes experiencing new things and having fun. \r\nAs for the art, the characters do not really have muchdetail, which is different, but does not mae a bad impression. The backgrounds are fairly smple too. As for the characters, maybe if the look it self isn't so sofisticated, the personalities are very different.\\n\r\nThe characters all have their own things, that are great about them. I wouldn't likke to tell you what they are but, Konata would have a good impression on any young beginner otaku. While Miyuki and Kagami will have a good impression on the clever kind, Tsukasa finally is the lazy one, funny and clumsy. All the supporting characters also have their own twist, which definately have been put effort into. \\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime very much and I plan on rewatching it soon. No matter how many times you rewatch an episode of Lucky Star, you will never get bored of it. \\n\r\nThe sound is great, the background mudic is not always noticeable, but when you listen into it it really shows the mood of the scene. As for me, I watched the dub, and I should say the voices were fairly good. \\n\r\nOverall I would rate Lucky Star 9/10. The two points that were taken away, are really because of the ending. It was fairly ruined, but you'll see why when you watch it. The ending songs weren't that good either. But overall I'd call it a pretty good anime. I would be really happy ifthey made another season.\\n",

            "content": "This anime goes purely along the slice of line genre. The plot may be boring at the start, and the focus of the story doesn't seem to portray initially. Characters were seen chatting for a long long time. However, if you survive through the first episode of this anime, you will gradually understand the storyline and enjoy it.\r\nThe art is a kind on its own, but i will say that not everyone will find that it's to their own taste. The art is simple and clear, bringing forth the necessary expressions when needed. Furthermore since this storyline is very slice of life based, complicated animationmay not be needed, so I feel that it is something that can be overlooked. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I not so satisfied is the way they chose to voice the not-so-important male and female characters with a weird voice (sounds like woman/man), and they are reusing it quite a lot of times. The background music is simple and short but I find it lacking it variety. Of course the seiyuus for the main characters are really great though. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Lucky Star each have a unique personality that depicts not only the Otaku society but also normal high school girls. It is fun as the series proceeds and you get to see more and more characters, all varying in personality. Some are dorky enough to get you laughing. \\n\\n\r\nThis is definitely a recommended anime for Otakus. All you need to do is sit back and relax and have a good laugh at the jokes the characters crack and the conversations going on in their daily school life. However, some of the content of the jokes requires knowledge on some anime or lifestyle of an Otaku. It involves specific terms sometimes that are hard to understand. \\n\\n\r\nThe rewatch value for this anime can be rated really high because the more you watch it, the funnier it gets as you understand the content fully.",

The character of Konata is so well written that it seems like she was created in a lab with a formula to please every anime watcher. The Hiiragi Kagami character adds as not only a compliment to Konata, but as a great centerpiece for adding social commentary and as many characters feed off of Kagami as they do Konata. Although the show names 4 characters asthe main characters, Lucky Star does raise Konata and Kagami to a higher level than it does Hiiragi Tsukasa or Takara Miyuki. Thats not to say that they aren't enjoyable when they are on screen. Tsukasa works as a perfect compliment to both Konata and Kagami, which is surprising considering the the polar opposite feel of thier personalities. Miyuki works well in giving \"moe\" to Lucky Star. Lucky Star is not about moe so she ends up being the butt of many jokes. Miyuki, however does manage to fit very well whenever she is on screen. The show also offers an abundance of supporting that give Miyuki and Tsukasa a run for heir money. Every one of them adds something different. The formuila does not change for the show with so many characters insteads builds on it and makes it seem very natural.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is not bad because well, there isn't one. The lack of a a progressing plot does not hurt the show because it's not focused on a plot, its focus is on its characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of Lucky Star is very basic. Nothing will really wow the viewers. The simplicity of the art is fit because the show is not complex in terms of development, in both a story or character. scenes where the art changes are typically for parody. This results from many references to other animes (Suzumiya Haruhi, Full Metal Panic, Street Fighter, Initial D, and many more).\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for Lucky Star may only be as enjoyable as the show. The opening theme \"Motteke Sailor Uniform\" is a very fast paced, and upbeat song that actually does work well in transitioning into the show.\"Motteke Sailor Uniform\" however, does not work well as the shows introduction, but if you like the show the song will grow on you.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end there not much changes from the beginning but as long as you became attatched these characters than its been an extremely enjoyable time.",

            "content": "The \"Slice of Life\" anime series is one where nothing is required, and what I mean when I say nothing is required is that we as viewers have nothing more to do than sit back and watch.  Certain shows introduce complex backdrops and settings, intricate story lines, historical figures that require a certain amount of research to fully understand, or character relationships that develop and introduce more than meets the eye as the story progresses.  I enjoy these characteristics in animes tremendously as they challenge us as a viewer to imagine and go beyond our basic understanding of \"normal\" to fully appreciate thestory being told in front of us.  That being said, sometimes its also nice to indulge ourselves into a realm of carefree and fun, where consequences are void and mindless merriment is abundant.  Lucky Star is one of those animes where we come to it for no other reason than to just decompress into an uncomplicated world of enjoyment, bare of an truly complicated plot or story line.  But does it deliver the guilty pleasure we desire?  I will examine this anime and attempt to give you an educated opinion as to the merits of Lucky Star, however, in the end you are the true master in the decision to watch the anime.  That being said, let us waste no more time as I now present to you my review of Lucky Star.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:  Remember, this is slice of life comedy, not an epic...\\n\\n\r\nTo try and write a story review for Lucky Star is difficult, as there is no \"real\" overarching story line to pay attention to, at least not like Code Geass, Death Note, or any other story driven anime.  The story centers around the misadventures of a group of friends while also introducing other characters who play a role to better advance the story of the other central characters.  From this, we see the true nature of story in Lucky Star comes from the characters themselves, not the events that are around them.  So how does this effect the overall story.  Not bad in the end.  There are plenty of characters in Lucky Star to where there is enough to keep us engaged from episode to episode and even the supporting characters help move along each episode's story.  There is no actual story in this anime though, now of course we could engage in a discussion on how the underlying story deals with maturity and coming of age for high school students as they realize that good friends and family are all you need to live a successful life, but we are going to look at the surface level of story.  Each episode for the most part deals with a new story line and there is no epiphanies or dramatic shockers that will get viewers like us going.  In the end though, its the life and times of each character that truly makes for a good story and this is quite enough to forgive no central plot and enjoy what is in front of us any given episode. (8/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:  We are here for the comedy and enterprise, not breathtaking visuals...\\n\\n\r\nWhen we look at the target audience for something like Lucky Star we would most likely conclude that its base would be a younger generation and most who are looking for something lighthearted, not something gritty and full of detail.  This is what we get in Lucky Star animation style, a simple animated world full of \"cuteness\" and playful image concepts.  There is no extravagant works of art here, as simple is the key word, and you most likely will not walk away fully taken away by some visual art seen from this anime.  All in all though, it gets the job done.  (6/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Lots of filler music, but some really exceptional voice acting work...\\n\\n\r\nMusic is one of those things you can sort of get away with depending on your product.  In movies or shows where you have a lot of drama or action, music can help enhance that experience ten fold as long as you fit the right music in at the right time (listen to almost any Hans Zimmer soundtrack).  But in comedies where it is more about dialog and interaction, music usually takes a back seat as there are other mechanics to take advantage of our emotions.  Lucky Star is in that category, the one where music isn't as much of a priority, as lots of the music in the anime are just simple melodies that play in the background and just become fillers so that the experience can seem complete, same with the sound effects.  The themes that play in the beginning and end are great, but this anime's soundtrack, should one exist, will not be a line item in my budget any time soon.\\n\r\nSound has two functions though, not just the music and sound effects but also voice acting, with this anime having excellent talent behind the microphone.  Both the Japanese and American voice actors do a fine job of portraying their characters, breathing life into each character to make them seem human and someone we can relate too.  Good voice acting is just as important as good acting on stage or on screen as this is the way we can hear and interpret characters we see, as there is no other conduit to see if the person portraying the character is a good fit (imagine Danny Devito voicing Darth Vader instead of James Earl Jones).  And in this anime there is not shortage for good voice acting, and each actor and actress fits into their character well, putting no doubts or thoughts in the back of our head challenging us as to whether or not the person voicing the character was the right choice.  (8/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  A great bunch of characters you can't help but love...\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably the best attribute of Lucky Star, and it delivers on a large scale.  The main characters of Kagami, Tsukasa, Myuki and Konata embody the strength that a powerful and well structured main character cast can have.  Whether it be Kagami's strong and strighforward attitude coupled with a girlish inner-complex, Tsukasa's loveable and naive nature, Miyuki's scholastic prowess, or Konata's tomboyish and nerdish attitude that acts as the central character and also as a symbol of no matter who or what you are you as long as you act with conviction and aren't afraid to embrace who you are you will live a fulfilling life.  All of these main characters serve to breath life into the story, mainly on their interactions not just internally with each other but also externally with other characters.  Events such as the characters and how each differs while at an anime convention, talking with family, interacting with people outside of their normal group, buying items at a store, or any other instance reinforces and creates the entertainment within Lucky Star.  As we discussed earlier in the Story part of the review, this animes story is really as strong as its characters, and while there may not be a great deal of story arc, their is lots of character arc to which I believe moves this little slice of life comedy into a story capturing the trials and maturity of four high school girls as they prepare for the road ahead.  Well done Lucky Star, well done.  (9/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  It's safe, I promise...\\n\\n\r\nUsually when you are contemplating watching anything, the one question that lingers in the back of your mind is \"will I actually enjoy it\"?  As for Lucky Star, as long as you can handle no overarching story line, high school slice of life, comedy, and just of bunch of characters having a good time than you will enjoy Lucky Star.   Remember, you're coming to Lucky Star so you can unwind and partake in some fun and relaxation that requires nothing from you, other than your undivided attention.  The characters and voice acting alone should be enough to create an enjoyable experience for yourself, so there shouldn't be any worries.  (8/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  Fun for the whole family...\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Lucky Star does well and really as long as you come prepared for adventures with a bunch of high school kids, anyone can find enjoyment in this anime.  As already stated, the story is not complex and deals in an episode-by-episode manner, the art is what it is, music fills in gaps while voice acting breaths talent into their respective characters, the cast each has a story to tell and it's well told, and everyone can take away at least a little enjoyment from the  experience.  Overall I believe that Lucky Star is a very good anime and should anyone be looking for something to watch on any given weekend afternoon, this is the perfect ticket.  (8/10)",

            "content": "Lucky Star can be best described as \"an anime version of Seinfield that focuses on four teenage high school girls with lots of moe,\" which is really the best way to describe it. If anyone have watched the 1990s classic American slice-of-life sitcom, Seinfield, it is quite infamous for having a lot of dialogue in the series that focuses on random and humorous topics. And there is a reason why Seinfield is referred to as \"a series about nothing.\"\r\nSimilarly, Lucky Star have a lot of nonsensical dialogue and conversations of different topics. Like many slice-of-life anime, there isn't a definite plot. However, the series ismostly centered around Japanese pop culture, the seiyuu references, and the otaku culture. As such, the series is primarily meant to be targeted towards the anime otaku in Japan. However, the series can still be enjoyable even for the non-otaku and western viewers (I, myself, while I consider to have interests and enjoy anime, I don't consider myself to be a hardcore otaku because I also have other interests outside of video games and anime. And I happen love and enjoy the series). The series does have a lot of quirky humor to it, but at least it covers broad range of topics and issues within numerous dialouge that makes it enjoyable. The ending is also enjoyable as well, as it does connect into how the OP of the series came to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe only downside to the series is the first episode. The first scene in the very first episode shows Konata, Miyuki, and Tsuakas spending about 8 minutes talking about food. This scene can shut off many first-time viewers there, but after watching that scene, the series gets more comical and fast-paced.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters. The characters are mostly flat characters. Their personalities doesn't change a lot, so I'd give a lower score there. However, each character have their own uniqueness that makes the series enjoyable. For example, the Hiiragi twins, Kagami and Tsukasa, is something to bring up. Both Kagami and Tsukasa can be comparable to the ying-yang concept. Kagami is a jaded, sarcastic, cynical tsundere who have a tedency to snap easily of the four main characters, but she also happens to be the most rational character in the series. Likewise, Tsukasa is more a kind-hearted, sweet, gentle, and more emotional girl who happens to be a heavy sleeper, forgetful, and quite clumsy at times. The Hiiragi twins comparison is also pointed out in the series in regards to their cooking styles as well (Kagami is more of a below-average cook while Tsukasa excels on cooking). Another example of character uniqueness is Konata and her cousin, Yutaka. Both happen to look younger than their actual high school age due to their height (the later happen to suffer some sort of an illness that limits her constitution and physical abilties). This is referenced throughout the series and joked multiple times. Konata mentions that she is highly aware of her own height and physique, and her self-awareness of this leads her to the conclusion that being a loiicon magnet is an inevitable fate. This kind of twist help viewers to understand the issue of lolicon (and issues regarding to child pornography and abuse), and spin this into a more humorous and satirical way.\\n\\n\r\nBear in note that not many people would enjoy the characters mainly due to the usage of moe and cuteness within the characters. Of course, moe is the probably the entire point of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking about Yutaka and Konata, the episode where Konata talks about her deceased mother, Kanata (who happens to have a similar appearance to Konata), with her father (who happens to have lolicon tendencies) is probably the most heartwarming moment of the series.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the Japanese/English soundtrack comparsion. Personally, there are great qualities of both the English and Japanese soundtrack. But as a dub fan, I personally prefer the dub mainly because Lucky Star is a fast-paced anime with lots of dialogue that allowed me to connect with the characters better. Since the series take references on Japanese pop culture and the seiyuus, most of the jokes would be lost. However, the series also take liberal references to the Haruhi Suzumiya series (another one of Kyoto Animation's works and the series is licensed by Bandai who also licensed the Haruhi series), so not all the jokes are lost. Besides, the dub is done by Bang Zoom! (who also have done the Haruhi dub) who uses the very same voice actors of the Haruhi dub, so I can give credit there dub. Also, the dub is not exact word-to-word translation and there are some jokes that need to be replaced in the dub to make it as enjoyable as the Japanese version. For example, in the dub, Akira Kogami mentions that Minoru Shiraishi sounds like a \"nerdy turtle.\" This is because the English VA of Minoru Shiraishi, Sam Riegel (who happens to voice another one of Minoru Shiraishi's roles, Taniguchi from Haruhi Suzumiya), also happens to voice Donatello from the 2003 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series. I'd say it all comes down to your own personal preferences (although there are some Japanese who does enjoy the English dub of Lucky Star).\\n\\n\r\nFor the voice acting, I'd enjoyed both the English and Japanese voice acting. I enjoyed Aya Hirano's voice acting of Konata because makes Konata sound really cute (particularly the Timotei scene), but I happen to enjoy Wendee Lee's voice acting because she gives Konata a \"geeky\" voice that fits into Konata's otaku personality. I happen to enjoy both Hynden Walch's and Shizuka Hasegawa's voice acting of Yutaka Kobayakawa. However, if I'm forced to choose between which one is better, I'd say Hydnen Walch because she manages to make Yutaka sound cute without being over the top cute AND sound naturally in English. I enjoyed Kari Wahlgren's VA on Kagami because she manages to make her sound more angrier and sarcastic than the Japanese version. The only voice acting I don't like in both Japanese and English version was Patricia Martin, as she sounds like a badly-pitched Minnie Mouse (funny that the character is based out of and voiced by Patricia Ja Lee). Of course, I'm pretty sure that was intentional by the producers, mainly because Patricia is suppose to satirical to the American otaku fanbase.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is available in both Engilsh and Japanese soundtrack. Unfortunately, Bandai has yet uploaded (or unwilling to do so) the episodes of Lucky Star dubbed and subbed online. So you'd probably either be forced to watch the illegal uploads, or go out and buy the Lucky Star Complete Collection. If you are looking for an anime series with lots of cuteness and quirky humor, this is something I would recommend. It would be nice to have a second season of Lucky Star. However, the ending comes out really smoothly and if there was a second season, it would most likely be focused on the other four girl group (Yutaka, Patrica, Hiyori, and Minami). That is mainly because the main four girl group (Konata, Tsukasa, Kagami, and Miyuki) happens to be seniors by the time the last episode aired. So it would be highly unnecessary that a high-school comedy based series to continue to focus on them into college. Highly improbable, but that is something that could be interesting.\\n\\n\r\nFrom my Mania.com blog: http://www.mania.com/aodvb/blog.php?b=3215",

I absolutely hate the fact that i'm giving it such a high score, but I can't give it anything less. Lucky Star is an amazing anime and one of my favorites of all time. I'm a sucker for character-driven anime, and this is right up my alley.\r\nIt's impossible not to compare this to Azumanga Daioh. While Azumanga Daioh is definitely funnier, Lucky Star has a sort of wit and cutting edge air about it. Not many people will get all of the jokes, and it definitely helps to understand Japanese(you lose a lot in the translation), but that makes it even more unique and special. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Lucky Star are oustanding, and while not quite up to par with Azumanga Daioh, there are more of them. And like Azumanga Daioh, they are all extremely interesting and likeable. Not a boring or useless character to be seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting character is probably Konata Izumi, the blue-haired, free spirited otaku. You're not sure if you'd prefer her as your wife or your daughter, but either way she's more moe-inducing than the girl who is designed to be stereotypically moe, and that says alot. \\n\\n\r\nHer dad is a creepy pervert, and the anime deals with it well; some might condone his behavior, but Lucky Star doesn't. It recognizes that he is a problem, but at the same time he's just a human like the rest of us. Perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThere are too many characters to list here, but rest assured that you won't be disappointed by any of them.\\n\\n\r\nEven though most of the humor comes from subtle observations on human behavior, otaku in-jokes, and wit, there is still some Azumanga Daioh type humor present that can be very funny. It can also be very touching, and one of the later episodes had me literally crying. \\n\\n\r\nAnd who can forget the opening credits? They are legendary.\\n\\n\r\nBeing based on a four-panel comic makes the anime translation a daunting task, but Lucky Star pulls it off splendidly, much better than Azumanga Daioh. The progression is fluid and perfectly paced. The empty space is put to good use with a 'lucky channel' corner at the end of every episode that is separate from the main show but still very entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the ending credits...the later episodes have the voice actors doing typically insane Japanese things in live action. Legendary!\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of the seiyuus, they did an amazing job. Lucky Star and Azumanga Daioh really set the standard for voice acting. And who would have thought that Aya Hirano, basically a bubble-gum pop star, would be so talented? Her work as Konata steals the show amongst a field of excellence. Our pop stars can't act their way out of a wet paper bag!\\n\\n\r\nSome don't like the art, and I suppose it is truly in the eye of the beholder, but I personally loved it. Everyone looks very young (even the adults) but they are all well drawn and their facial expressions are extremely well done. Especially Konata. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this was an amazing anime and a classic in my book. Completely entertaining with an unforgettable and loveable cast with great voice acting, it is downright hilarious, and its replay value is neverending. Nothing else to ask for.\\n\\n\\n",

I like it because the main character is an otaku. That's pretty much the only reason why fans would watch this anime. \r\nStory 7/10\r\nI say the story is some-what okay. It kinda gets boring when the characters start talking about a subject. I noticed that most of their conversations start with \"You know how....\" and blah blah blah. They subjects can be pretty boring but I think try to raise a good point.\r\nTheir are also some touching moments inthe story that make you wanna say awwwwww. Those are some of the good scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nArtwork tells the story. It says this is a cute happy humor anime. Characters design are made to look kinda chibi-like. Some character designs are even funnier because they are drawn completely different from the regular art thus making it more funny.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nMusic is great. though I don't really stay and listen to the theme songs in the ending credits. Sounds in the story are very quiet which balances the story theme.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nCharacters are the one of the best. However most of the female characters aren't introduced until half way through the anime and there aren't many male characters. But I not complaining. I believe this is more of a girl anime than a boy's. But boy or girl it dosen't really make a difference. It's great ether way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nThough it is boring sometimes there are some parts that get you going. Make you laugh. Get you excited. It's not exciting like those action animes, but it's sometimes best to have a slow pace theme. Which is good for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nOverall this is a good anime. A definetly want to watch. I give it a better rating if there was less boring talk scenes but besides that it's great. You gotta watch it.",

I'm not one to usually watch an anime without *some* sort of plot, but this one took me by surprise when it actually held me throughout the series.\r\n I began Lucky Star thinking that ii would turn out to just leave me unsatisfied because of the lack of plot, like some ecchi anime that I've watched, but that's just me.   \r\nI gave the sound a nine because I'm not really anexpert on sound and I don't really get the meaning of it unless they're talking about the seiyuu's (voice actor's) in which case the main characters were good except for that one guy that does random, not main character voices, that has an annoying voice. But that, too is just me. (\" -_- )\\n\\n\r\nYou may be asking yourself, why did she give the story a 3 if there is no story, well, I gave it a three because:\\n\r\n    1) I just can't give anything a completely horrible score when it left me all warm and  fuzzy inside \\n\r\nAnd\\n\r\n    2) It sort of reminded me of life, only all the happy, sad, mad, confused, and all that jazz, parts were cut out leaving the parts that make you laugh out loud and want to pee your pants because of their faces and how real it seems, because you yourself can relate to a character in some way or another.\\n\\n\r\nI gave the art a ten because I thought that the characters were cute and it was colorful and appealing to the eye.   \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were given a ten because I really liked two in particular, Konata and Kagami because they were the ones that made me laugh the most (^.^). I also gave it a ten because well, I liked their characters, practical and funny by default, someone who is true to themselves, sometimes to the point that its a little embarrassing that the same thing is true with you >///.>\\n\\n\r\nIf you want an anime that makes you laugh and you're alright with it not having much of a plot, then this would be a good choice for you '___' wow, that sounded so much like I was trying to sell you something that I'll just go away now....(._.).....\u03b5=\u03b5=\u03b5=\u250c(;*\u00b4\u0414`)\uff89...\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

Overall Lucky Star is an Excellent Anime, the art hurt it a little in my eyes, but it was able to recover with good stories.",

            "content": "There was a time that I used to think of \"cute girls doing cute things\" shows as nothing but cups of water with neither taste nor substance to keep things standing out or original. However, Lucky Star is probably the first anime that hit me enough to  \u0336m\u0336a\u0336k\u0336e\u0336 force me to have a different view. And you know what, it's not really that bad to set myself loose once a while.\r\nWhen I first got into the show, episode 1 to be more specific, I must say it was downright awful and empty that I almost drop the damn show, no kidding. I mean, whywould you waste 8 precious minutes of your life for a scene with girls discussing how to eat food...properly. Gosh, I still remember that one as if it was yesterday. However, my instinct was right, as I kept watching I found myself engulfed in a rather strange phenomenon that refused to let go of me.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main problems people often find with Lucky Star is probably its lack of effective humor. While I am of no position to judge anything, I'd like to say that when it comes to such personal taste matter, like humor, drama, \"philosophy\", etc. you can't really expect one anime to be able to satisfy all the need. Think about it, what this person \"A\" thinks is funny can't guarantee that I or YOU would feel the same way. It's all subjective, so yeah, Lucky Star might have had this one as its \"supposedly\" flaw, I don't see any problem with that, and in fact, I did find some of the references in this anime funny and well, nicely executed.\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, the thing that bugs me the most during my watching is perhaps the \"Lucky Channel\" at the end of almost every episode. I personally think of it as nothing but \"filler\" to lengthen the duration of the show. Although I don't hold any grudge against that section of Lucky Star, I just can't seem to find any of it enjoyable or...funny.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the next point, story. Now we all must know that Slice of Life anime has no definition of \"plot\", but that doesn't mean they would all be boring and pointless without one. Lucky Star simply depicts the very typical daily activities of the girls, nothing more, nothing left. This anime can also be considered as a \"healing\" product, not for something so complicated or powerful in order to inflict some impact on the viewers. That said, I do think that some parts of this anime were sort of repetitive, thus giving me mixed feeling in the ride as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nThat is not to say this anime has nothing really special in regard to the story. Though I can't really explain, there were some moments in Lucky Star that I find very \"true\", it's like the characters are acting what we practically do every day. Kyoto Animation sure did a good job of executing the story, I'd dare say there wasn't really a wasted scene in the process of making the anime. To me this one of the strongest points of Lucky Star, it doesn't really cling onto one joke too long but would instead swap place with the next one as soon as possible, just so if you don't find this scene funny then yeah, maybe the next one would work.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the character, this is by far the best thing that Lucky Star has to offer, just my 2cent that is. The cast is relatively small in the beginning, just 4 ordinary \"moe\" girls with nothing really stands out. As the story progresses, more characters join the fun and thus making it more \"colorful\" in many ways. However, this can also be considered a double-edged sword as it resulted in lots of character getting \"left behind\".\\n\\n\r\nTo me, the girls in Lucky Star really play their part well as the popular demand, by doing what they do best: cute things. Lame as it may sound, I can't deny that I got hooked several times just by staring at them doing these absolutely normal things. On top of that, there was one particular being that constantly appearing on my radar, which is Kagami, the short-tempered, twin tail sister-like character, and this is also, in my opinion, the best character of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance I didn't really pay attention to her much, I thought she was just another generic Tsundere that would keep going on my nerves just like many others, but in the end, Lucky Star once again surprised me with this little \"moe\" thing. This is also from this anime that I finally got to know (and feel) what moe really is. Mere words can't simply describe how weird this feeling is whenever I see her, but well, I guess this is why there are so many people succumbed to these kinds of show.\\n\\n\r\nEnough with the rambling, from my observation, Kagami isn't just some cliche character that would remain the same till the rest of the show, but instead, has developments. Apparently, it may sound stupid, but when I think about it, it's not something to be made fun of. Though the development isn't really that special, mind-blowing, or dramatic like many other great shows, I still find it commendable and noteworthy for an anime like Lucky Star. It proves that through little things we can slowly change to be something else without even being aware of it, this is also one of the special things about Lucky Star.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, Lucky Star has a rather odd art style to say the least. However, I got used to it after a few episodes and eventually grow to like it. The direction is quite brilliant, as mentioned above, they won't keep you stuck inside a single joke for a long time, it's like a train to visit many different places in a park that will at least make you feel not \"condensed\". The character design is, as expected, seemingly sparkling and kinda irritating if you're not familiar with these kinds of show. Still, I think it's quite remarkable for Kyoto Animation to make me enjoy the girl's design before I even knew it. It just simply happened that way, I couldn't even tell why but you get the idea, moe sure is a dangerous thing.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, an anime cannot be completed without sound, and Lucky Star sure did a great job at this aspect. The opening is probably the highlight of the show. Admittedly, I didn't like it, no, I must say I hated it in the beginning. It was the too cheesy with the annoying voice of the characters that made me skip a few times. Nonetheless, strangely enough, when I got tired of skipping I decided to just let it slide and enjoy whatever it got, and the result after a few episodes later was astonishing, I fell with love with the opening without question. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting sure is interesting, I normally can't really stand the typical \"cute\" voice of the girls since it can easily get on my nerves, but I guess Lucky Star is an exception. The background music is also well-distributed, there were moments that I instantly laughed when the music started playing since they fit the mood so well. The Endings are not really to my taste but well at least I can say it's not boring watching people doing weird things behind the scene.\\n\\n\r\nUnexpectedly, an anime that I had little interest outwardly turned out to be something very entertaining and unforgettable. Though there flaws that could not be overlooked due to my nitpicking nature, I think if you're someone who's really into slice of life then this anime is a must-watch. For those who seeks \"healing\" anime, give this one a try, at least 2 episodes like I did before deciding to drop. And well, if you're the type who only enjoy action, drama, especially those who strictly seek humor then I don't think this is the right place for you.",

            "content": "Lucky Star, a slice of life, parody, comedy anime getting as close to an otaku's life while keeping the situation as close to reality as possible.\r\nThis anime depicts the daily life of high school girl and otaku, Konata Izumi as she spends her daily life studying for tests, working, shopping with friends, watching anime, reading manga, playing online games with her teacher and other normal otaku stuff.\r\nIt is a purely comedy anime and most of the situations are relatable to.\r\nStory:\r\nNot much of a story. The whole series goes from their first year of high school to graduation but that's not what's important. The episodes aredivided into parts, each part has a different plot/story. \\n\r\nIt takes some references from other popular anime which ,if you've seen, will definitely enjoy. Anime like Haruhi Suzumiya is mostly referenced to in this series. \\n\r\nThe situations in each episode are as real as they can get. You'll find yourself saying \"Woah, that's exactly how it happens.\" after watching some episodes. This relation to the reality is what makes it worth watching and fun.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThere are 4 main characters in the anime to start off. Additional characters enter as the series progresses. Let's talk about the main characters here;\\n\r\n-Konata Izumi: High school Otaku. Online game player. Studies for test the day before. Copies homework from her friends. Gives anime/manga references to real life situations. Funny, short, blue haired otaku.\\n\r\n-Kagami Hiiragi: The intelligent, realistic friend of Konata who also reads books and sometimes light novels. Not as interested in anime as her friend. A tsundere who makes the series really fun to watch. Think of her as your friend who sticks with you but is closer to reality and focusses on studies and stuff instead of anime.\\n\r\n-Tsukasa Hiiragi: Kagami's sister and similar to Konata in terms of not studying. She doesn't watch much anime like her sister. She is the innocent type and air-head type of character. Adding fun to the series through her innocence is her role\\n\r\n-Miyuki: The intelligent, rich lady type friend of Konata. She is the ideal high school girl. Studies hard, good at sports, well endowed. The funny side might be her moe factor as Konata points out. She is a bit clumsy and afraid to go to the dentist.\\n\\n\r\nSide characters enter the series and make it more fun.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening dance is pretty cool. A full version of the dance is performed in episode 24. The opening song is catchy and the dance is pretty awesome. It made me watch every opening. Though the ending is nothing special and shows the door of a Karaoke room where the 4 friends are singing.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art might be the biggest turn back sign for people. But I think that this type of art perfectly compliments the anime. It might look like Chibi but it is not. It's just that the heads are way bigger than usual but the characters still look well designed. The backgrounds are nothing that special. The major focus of this anime is the comedy and situations so there is not much focus on the art.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIt is really enjoyable. When I first watched it, I stopped after 3 episodes and watched other anime. But I made a resolve to watch it completely and I was not disappointed. It is really enjoyable, laughable and a relatable show. I mostly fin myself in the situations shown in this anime. An example, when I give an anime reference to my friends who haven't seen that anime or when I'm copying files to my computer and the \"Time remaining\" changes from 30 mins to 60 mins. These kind of situations make me burst out laughing. And I'm sure you will too because there are tonnes of other situations like this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I love this anime. Watched it 4 times. Will watch it again when free. I would recommend this to anyone looking for some non-serious anime to pass the time with a blast.",

It's random, and does a lot of references to other anime. \r\nI thought it was really funny at times, only thing about it is it's pretty short with only 24 episodes. \r\nIt's made by Kyoto Animation which created Clannad, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzimiya, K-On!, Full Metal Panic! and more. \r\nThe main protagonist is Konata Izumi, which is who the anime mainly focuses on.\r\nShe lives with her dad, her mother passed away before the anime started, and her cousin ends up moving in with her midwaythrough the anime.\\n\r\nKonata's an otaku, who loves playing RPG games, watching anime, reading manga, and attending anime conventions. She even works at a cosplay cafe. \\n\r\nTwo of her friends are fraternal twins, which means they aren't identical. And the other one comes from a wealthy family. Haven't watched another anime which uses the type of animation style Lucky Star uses. All the characters look rather young, even some adults. \\n\r\nA recommended anime for anybody who likes slice of life comedies.",

            "content": "Intro:\r\nThe reason why I like Lucky Star is it because it makes fun of so many other animes of it's kind. Though some people may be turned off by the fact that it's \"just another school girl anime\", it really is more than that. I'll explain why.\r\nStory: 6\r\nSchool girls living their life. Moving on...\r\nArt: 7 \r\nOK here we go. What makes the art in Lucky Star unique is that most of the time it'll have short people with big heads, but some characters will be very tall and drawn with detail as a joke. It makes an already funny show even funnier.\r\nSound: 8\r\nThe voice actingfor both the Japanese and American versions of the show are excellent. I don't know why everyone is whining and complaining about the English dub, because if you ask me it's pretty good. We have Haruhi from Haruhi as Konata, Yatsuha from Samurai Champloo as Tsukasa and Minami, Fuu from Samurai Champloo as Kagami, and Kallen Stadtfeld from Code Geass as Miyuki. How could you go wrong with all those people? You couldn't.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe personalities of the characters in Lucky Star are original. In most school girl animes these days, even Azumanga Daioh I must admit, usually have flat, thin personalities as the main characters. Konata managed to get her own religion from her role here as the anime watching, video gaming, pokemon-naming master of all weirdos. I mean really, how often in an anime do you find a character that WATCHES other animes and could kick your ass at Street Fighter 2 anyday? Not often, not often at all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nThough some of the earlier episodes are a little slow, once you get past episode 5 the laughter begins and never ends. There's even a touching moment in episode 22 and an epic ending. Not to mention that the Akira and Shiraishi episode endings never fail to have your jaw dislocated at the end from laughing so hard.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nWith all mentioned earlier and a crapload of Haruhi references and other illusions to other animes like Full Metal Alchemist in one certain episode, Lucky Star won't fail to entertain both men and women a like. (but probably men especially)",

            "content": "Self-parody is perhaps one of the easiest forms of comedy to create. The only real pre-requisite to it is knowledge and understanding of your subject matter. Determine the relevant clich\u00e9s and the tropes that go along with it, and exaggerate them until you reach the point of mockery. The more niche your chosen medium is, the easier it becomes to create a parody it. When there are more die-hard fans than casual viewers to entertain, familiarity with the tropes or clich\u00e9s is more widespread, and the scope for references is at its maximum. This can create an environment where outsiders unfamiliar with the medium areexcluded from the humour, while those who understand the jokes feel that they are a part of something \"special\"... ironically even that they are the \"outsiders\" for being within the \"group\".\\n\\n\r\nFor these reasons, it is hard to be optimistic about the quality of any self-parodying anime. The medium is so ridiculous to begin with that the jokes practically write themselves, while the audience is so absorbed by their bubble lives that they will love it regardless of its quality. The object of comedy writing is to make your audience laugh by highlighting truth, not by limiting your audience and preying on narcissism. An inside joke should be kept private, not aired publicly to determine who among us are truly worthy of the \"otaku\" neologism.\\n\\n\r\nThere is little doubt that Lucky Star is padded out with innumerable references to various anime and videogames. It aired in 2007 and its references ranged from the very recent (Haruhi Suzimiya) to the quite old (Urusei Yatsura, various 70s Mecha series). The references are seldom obscure but are targeted to Japanese audiences, including shows that were not as well received in the West, such as 'To Heart' and 'Maria-sama ga Miteru'. There is much to be found here for those who are blessed with the knowledge.\\n\r\n But I am far more concerned for those who don't. We must look instead to the relationships between the characters, observations about everyday life and to satire for humour instead. Unlike references these possess universality, they can be understood by almost everyone. Despite its \"otaku-pandering\" image, Lucky Star is perhaps the only parody anime which understands this principle.\\n\\n\r\nThe personality of almost every female character in the series is based on a common anime archetype. These archetypes have often become so exaggerated that they no longer reflect actual human behaviour. Lucky Star takes a different approach and instead transposes the behaviour into realistic situations, before tuning it for comedic effect. The best example in the series is Kagami Hiiragi's character: a parody of the 'tsundere' archetype, she appears cold and standoffish, but has a 'heart of gold'. In many series this comes across as sweeping mood-swings and excessive embarrassment about revealing emotion. Kagami's character on the other hand is a more subtle approach of dedication to academics and emotional inexperience. Elements of the original archetype are undeniable, yet we can relate to her character and understand not just her actions but her thinking behind them.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a tremendous irony that a show intended to parody outlandish stereotypes should in fact produce characters who behave more like humans than the stereotypes themselves. All the same it is a paradox which serves Lucky Star very well, giving it far wider appeal than it otherwise would have. The backbone of the series comedy is the relationship between the aforementioned Kagami Hiiragi and Konata Izumi. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the few characters in the series not based on a character archetype, Konata is instead based on a rather peculiar idea: a self-idealised portrayal of the viewer. A similar idea is used in harem anime, where a very plain lead character exists for the viewer to 'insert' themselves into; Konata on the other hand uses the imagined personality of a harem viewer and places it in the body of their ideal girl- a woman of legal age with the appearance of a young girl. The idea is completely ridiculous, yet very effective in generating comedy\\n\r\n.  \\n\r\nBut while the concepts for both characters are based on anime parody, the most of the humour between them is actually derived from a clash of personalities. Konata is lazy; while Kagami is hard-working. Kagami wants to be mature but isn't; Konata has no pretences about her immaturity. Konata is unabashed; Kagami is quite shy. The conflict between the two, and indeed the relations between all of the characters in Lucky Star, are genuine and the true source of comedic value for the series. While the references, however copious they are in quantity, are merely an addition in content. Familiarity with them will enhance the experience, but they are by no means a pre-requisite. It may also come as a surprise that Lucky Star can be quite sharp and biting in its comedy. Having no qualms about poking fun of controversial subjects or making harsh jokes at the expense of its own audience. Contrary to expectations, it is the most scathing anime parody since the downright mean-spirited 'Otaku no Video'. \\n\\n\r\nThis may come as a surprise given the bright and childish art style, which is effective, but not radical. If one were to describe it in a single word, \"sugary\" would be the likely choice. Hair colours come in every colour of the rainbow, and seldom any colour outside of it. The cast are very cutesy with very long, large eyes (even by anime standards) and liberal use of cartoonish expressions. It suits the show well and is very neat, but doesn't present much opportunity for interesting visuals- indeed the camera placement is standard throughout.  Occasionally other art styles will be borrowed for a quick parody- examples of this include Initial D and Haruhi Suzimiya. Overall it's a work of high quality if little daring. The soundtrack is much the same, with the exception of the ending themes- karaoke performed 'in character' by the cast. Most are forgettable but Aya Hirano's version of \"Cha-la, Head Cha La\" from Dragonball Z more than makes up for them. SPARKING!\\n\\n\r\nSeparating Lucky Star from its origins as a work of parody is an impossible task. The whole series is built upon them, and one cannot analyse the series without making any references to them. But just as you don't need to know jack shit about architecture to appreciate a nice looking building, you don't need to know that much about anime to find humour in the interactions of a group of close friends. \\n\r\nOr tomodachis, if you prefer.\\n",

            "content": "For all of its achievements in storytelling, cinematography, theming and all those other words we all love so much, something that a lot of fans tend to forget with time is that anime can be weird. I can be obtuse, it can be confusing, hell it can be outright stupid at times, and the admittance fee can appear to be way too high to someone on the outside looking in. \r\nThis was pretty much my situation in the summer of 2013, anime was something I had been acutely aware of but had no idea how to go about getting into. And with such a seeminglyincoherent consensus regarding what\u2019s great and what\u2019s terrible, it was a scene I was pretty content to ignore. I had been a mildly big Dragon Ball fan up to this point, had a growing adoration of Studio Ghibli, and had seen enough bits and pieces of popular shows that, while I had enjoyed, didn\u2019t necessarily convince me that this was something that appealed to ME in particular.\\n\r\nInterestingly enough, it wasn\u2019t until skimming through a random vlog by YouTuber Digibrony that I caught sight of a stray wall scroll for a series I had never heard of that was implacably appealing. All of my favourite shows at the time were on some form of break and I was kind of hankering for another show to get into, so I passively looked it up on YouTube and hunted down the first episode. If only I could have known what I had just begun.\\n\r\nBefore I can blink I\u2019m thrown headfirst into a trio of immeasurably adorable girls ranting about their favourite foods for upwards of 10 minutes. It was so bafflingly bizarre different from anything I\u2019d ever experienced and I had no way of rationalising how anyone saw fit to animate this. And I was in love. I\u2019ve heard a number of people, even fans detail how this was a terrible way to start the series and in no way represents the show\u2019s true potential. For me, I was hooked. HARD. The second I realised that it wasn\u2019t some sort of gag, and that the characters\u2019 really were just talking about how they eat their favourite foods in unnecessary amounts of detail, I knew that I had stumbled across something amazing. This may actually be the most effective and memorable first episode if any anime series for me, and sets up the show\u2019s characters, tone and atmosphere as perfectly as I could imagine.\\n\r\nAnyway, Lucky Star is a quiet, slow-paced comedy series starring 4 high school girls living their lives in about as normal a capacity as possible. The show is the very definition of slice of life, with all of the various random slices being split into segments and a set number of those segments making up the runtime of an episode. But the thing that makes Lucky Star so interesting as one of my first anime series is the otaku-centricity evident in virtually every aspect of its design. The one thing I knew about this series going in is that our protagonist Konata is obsessed with anime, video games and manga to the point that the majority of her dialogue is layered with some type of obscure reference. A big part of the comedy is built around how little her friends understand her, and the funny thing is neither did I. I\u2019ve heard multiple times that all of Lucky Star\u2019s appeal would fly right past a viewer that doesn\u2019t know anything about otaku culture, but I slowly realised how untrue that was, at least for me. Seeing Konata\u2019s passion for collecting figures and DVDs that pretty much reflected my passion for collecting video games inspired me to learn everything I could to ascend to her level. The show does as much explaining as it does referencing and it created this feeling of camaraderie for members of the audience that were \u201cin the know\u201d so to speak. Whenever Konata would use a word I didn\u2019t know, I was compelled to look it up. Whenever she spoke highly of a show, suddenly I really wanted to check it out. I\u2019ve gotten more anime recommendations from Konata alone than I have from any of my friends. I think a big part of the why the show had this effect on me is because of its tendency to invite the audience IN, rather than push them away, leading to a wave of otaku pride and camaraderie with Konata as the poster child.\\n\r\nOne of my favourite things about Konata\u2019s character is that despite the fact that the show does portray her as the type of hardened fujoshi that stays up all night playing MMOs, she is also shown to have pretty great social skills. She\u2019s perfectly adept at maintaining close friendships and over the course of the show we see Konata progressively assimilating her friends to the dark side, dragging them to cons and pressuring them to cosplay. Konata\u2019s relationship with her friends is pretty similar to my relationship with Lucky Star as a whole when I first watched it. Even when I didn\u2019t understand everything it was saying, it had more than enough going for it that I found it wholly enjoyable. \\n\r\nOne of the show\u2019s absolute greatest strengths is its completely realistic and natural feeling dialogue that carries most scenes. The characters have so much chemistry and they all converse so organically that it blows my mind that this was a scene that someone actually had to write as opposed to an interaction happening in real-time. It\u2019s also crazy freaky how well the show manages to take the little thoughts at the back of my head I\u2019ve had but never known how to vocalise, and present them in the form of an animated series. Hearing Konata talk about the frustration of dealing with two casts for anime and drama CDs perfectly reflected how I was feeling about subs and dubs at the time. She concludes that while it does indeed take some getting used too, you\u2019re ultimately getting two casts for the price of one! There\u2019s this other scene were Konata suggests that because of blogs, magazines and forums, youths read more now than they ever did before, which was exactly the point I was constantly trying to make. Konata trying to establish a solid definition for the word \u201cmoe\u201d was also fantastic. The writer\u2019s clearly had an expert understanding of the quirks and idiosyncrasies inherent in people, and the fact that they could so perfectly and consistently implement them onto fictional characters is a massive achievement and increases my belief in the show\u2019s world tenfold. There\u2019s a reason watching this show brings out feelings of nostalgia and glee to fans. Memories of aimless conversations with friends about nothing, hell I\u2019m having one right now. It\u2019s not quite as enjoyable as Lucky Star, but still. In fact, that right there may be the very reason a pretty decent amount of anime fans vehemently despise this show: I guess they\u2019ve never known friendship. There is something inherently soothing about this kind of experience. It\u2019s pretty much the same as the psychological effects that Let\u2019s plays and podcasts have on viewers, and just like Lets Plays and podcasts, I don\u2019t think a show like this would really work without interesting people to carry it, especially after seeing so many other similar shows trying to recapture this show\u2019s magic and failing.\\n\r\nThe characters in Lucky Star are by no means the most deep, complicated or interesting people in anime history, but I think it\u2019s kind of narrow-minded to consider them shallow by any means, and to do so would be ignoring so many aspects of what can make a character engaging. The girls in this show are thoroughly and consistently characterised, have fantastic chemistry, memorable character designs and different comedic highlights. I\u2019ve always been a huge fan of shows that can realistically depict friendship while also managing to make all of the characters individual. For a while my favourite character was Tsukasa, whose constant failing only gets more and more brutal, but by the end I found myself completely in love with Kagami. She\u2019s the most developed and interesting to me, has by far the most unique and creative poses and expressions in the show, her chemistry with Konata is legendary and she overall is the star of a lot of the show\u2019s most memorable scenes. Since Kagami is slightly more insecure and cynical than the others, she tends to headline some of the more sombre and introspective moments. There\u2019s even little nuggets of character development for those paying attention. At the beginning of the series, Kagami is shown to outright dislike Konata, and denounces her scummy otaku ways openly. But throughout the series, Kagami gradually lowers her guard and becomes better acquainted to Konata\u2019s obsession, while also sharing some of her own interests. There\u2019s this great scene in the middle of the series where Konata and Tsukasa find themselves completely unfulfilled while Kagami\u2019s hanging out with some other friends, illustrating the subtle change in the group\u2019s dynamic. \\n\r\nAgain, these aren\u2019t characters that demand your attention with wacky gimmicks and catchphrases, but rather characters built from simple concepts, but developed with enough detail to make them memorable. We see EVERY aspect of these girls lives in complete detail. Since there\u2019s no narrative to speak of, the show has the opportunity to go into the type of detail that most shows just can\u2019t. We get to know all of their family members and the dynamics that come with it, which is extremely rare in anime. We get to see them in their downtime and fussing about little problems like room temperature, which creates a strong sense of immersion and relatability. Things like Kagami trying to get sleepy by reading a book, but only becoming tired the second it time to wake up. Or Kagami finding her favourite handkerchief was in her pocket for a year. Or Kagami having a non-stop crappy day which culminates in her forgetting her wallet while AT the till. Yeah, Kagami is by far the most relatable character to me. \\n\r\nAnother one of the most enjoyable and refreshing things about Lucky Star is how grounded in reality it is. Every exceedingly profound and emotional moment you\u2019d come to expect from anime ends up being brilliantly subverted in Lucky Star. One of the most telling moments of the shows unidealistic nature is when Konata starts hyping up the start of the new school year as a chance for a brand new, visual novel-style encounter with a guy, before immediately realising that in the real world, she\u2019s actually starting afresh with a bunch of awkward high school boys that have no interest in her whatsoever. With that said, the girls in this show aren\u2019t really portrayed as the unfathomably gorgeous women that most viewers are accustomed to in anime. I mean, their definitely cute and all, but other than Miyuki, none of the girls really stand out as the type that would get lots of attention, which pisses them off endlessly. This, once again, increases my immersion in the Lucky Star\u2019s setting massively. Dumb arguments with sisters that resolve themselves, moments of fleeting melancholy after an amazing concert, Lucky Star nails it all without ever feeling too \u201canime\u201d.\\n\r\nThis show got me thinking pretty hard about how parody can be done right in a show, and how it can be done massively wrong. Parody is the blood that runs through Lucky Star\u2019s veins and the script is so dense with call-backs and shout-outs that there are pretty comprehensive online guides trying to decipher every single reference. This is most noteworthy in the Lucky Channel segment after each episode, which is definitely the most adult and self-referential part of the show. Watching an animated Minoru Shiraishi make a case for why it\u2019s blasphemous to consider Kagami a run of the mill tsundere, or Akira spitefully calling Tsukasa a \u201cdroopy eyed\u201d moeblob adds an extra layer of self-awareness to the already masterfully meta series. Watching Konata criticize the Haruhi ending just as harshly as the fans did was also brilliant, especially considering Kyoto Animation themselves made the show only a year earlier. By the way Konata, you\u2019re wrong. That episode was awesome. Watching Konata watch her voice actress Aya Hirano perform her character\u2019s song from Haruhi may be the most mind-blowingly meta thing ever put to animation. Anyway my point is that with every parody and callback, I can feel the creator\u2019s incredible love for anime culture, and how much of that love they poured into this series. I imagine watching this show in 2007 was a revelation, since every joke and quip would have been particularly relevant. The equal levels of passion for otakuism that both the people making and watching Lucky Star feel creates a massive sense of camaraderie that exponentially increases my adoration of the show.\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s cheap, cynical garbage like The Big Bang Theory that uses nerd culture as a consistent punchline to point the finger of judgement at society\u2019s supposed biggest outcasts. Every tired meaningless reference to something the writer\u2019s assume nerds like is so worn thin that instead of inviting you in, it separates the audience into opposing fragments: the people that think they\u2019re above the main characters, and the people who sheepishly admit the shame that is relating to them to some degree. Every character\u2019s development involves them distancing themselves from their nerdy roots as much as possible and finding a woman that can teach them the ways of the civilised man. That show is cancer and watching it is bad for you. But enough about that.\\n\r\nIn terms of art and animation Lucky Star is gorgeous. All of the characters and settings have a fantastic hand drawn aesthetic with an awesome Crayola-like palette. The show creatively prevents the audience becoming bored with the sight of girls talking with occasional hyper-detailed shots of passer-by\u2019s, dead cicadas, scenery, the works. KyoAni has become massively acclaimed for their incredible attention to detail that makes their characters and settings feel real, and this may be the show that kicked off their reputation for producing some of anime\u2019s greatest visual masterpieces. Lucky Star\u2019s big moments are made that much more engaging thanks to the production value, particularly in its dedication to a joke. But, one of the most impressive aspects of the show\u2019s visuals to me are how well it can communicate a scene\u2019s tone with its shading and lighting effects, making the more melancholic and even touching scenes much more effective than they would have been otherwise. The character designs are fantastic and kind of iconic at this point. The show put a lot of priority on giving everyone unique and detailed outfits, which for me is always a good thing and I\u2019ve always been a huge fan of how expressive all of the expressions are. The soundtrack fits this show like a glove with one or two tracks being among my all-time favourites in anime. It all enhances the already perfect tone and establishes a real \u201ccinema\u201d that is unique to this show. They\u2019re the type of fun, bubbly tracks that remind you of your youth, and help you see the simple beauty in mundanity.\\n\r\nOh man, the more I think about it, the more I realise how important it is to me. There\u2019s just not that much to complain about with this show. I mean if I had to force myself to find something to pick on, at the halfway point of the show, Konata\u2019s cousin joins the show, along with a new batch of freshman. These girls aren\u2019t nearly as fun or memorable as the originals. I mean, I don\u2019t dislike any of them, but they just can\u2019t match the chemistry of the main girls, which makes sense considering they\u2019ve known each other for much less time, but it also means they\u2019re not as fun to watch. The new girls are mostly defined by about one or two traits that don\u2019t make them particularly interesting as people. Also, introducing 2 new otaku girls to join Konata was a weird decision, and sort of numbs the idea that Konata is the standout nerd on the show. But still, these aren\u2019t big complaints in the slightest, and I definitely think the second half of the show is better anyway, so whatever.\\n\r\nWhen I finished Lucky Star within the span of a few days, during that fateful summer, I immediately declared it to be my favourite anime of all time. And while I don\u2019t really feel that way anymore, I still love this series to death. Every aspect of the show ends up being more than the sum of its parts entirely due to fantastic execution. To paraphrase one of my favourite readings on the show, by Daria Morgendorfor, Lucky Star is so thorough in its shallowness that it somehow transforms into depth. 2 years and hundreds of anime later, I still find that the show is massively entertaining, even more so than it used to be now that I actually understand the jokes and it still has a very special place in MyAnimeList. It\u2019s also proven itself over the years to be one of the most rewatchable anime I\u2019ve ever seen. I can watch any episode of Lucky Star at ANY time without having to worry about arcs. I find that I actually prefer the English Dub of the show, which is exceptionally rare for me. The dialogue\u2019s been spiced up, everyone suits their characters perfectly and bring something unique to their role and Konata once again shared a voice actress with Haruhi, this time Wendee Lee. One thing, however, that Lucky Star does that literally no other anime can do for me is somehow make me forget that snobby, bitter, egotistical, evil anime fans exist. The anime community collapses into itself and all is right with the world. When I watch the show, I\u2019m taken back to where I was when I first watched it, no MAL reviews, no 4chan, no unwarranted opinions other than my own. Just me and the show. Pure bliss.\\n\\n\r\nFor more go check out my YouTube channel!: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4qXgaUdP5klnVpGWQfxJ-g\\n",

            "content": "Lucky Star is a very popular anime. Its one of the shows that almost everyone who watches a good amount of anime has probably at least heard of the show. Whenever i saw people talking about the show on the internet they talked about how cute all the characters and how they could relate themselves to Konata the main character. But the number one thing I heard was how the show apparently was about \"nothing.\" A show about nothing is quite a weird thing to say. Normally the most important thing about any piece of entertainment that is not music is the plot. So afterhearing this much I decided to watch the first episode of \"Lucky Star.\" \\n\\n\r\nSo of course the first thing i saw was the shows opening theme. Full of choreographed dancing done by girls that looked like they were in middle school and full of energy it was quite a sight to behold. But then came the actual show. The first 10 minutes of the show was spent by a couple of girls talking about how to eat food. It was extraordinarily boring. Thats when i realized this show was actually about nothing very literally. So i finished the episode and began to forget about the show.\\n\\n\r\nOne day i start talking to my friend about anime and i bring up \"Lucky Star.\" He then says how much he liked the show and how i should give it another chance . So I did and I watched all 24 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe main character is Konata. She is your classic modern tomboy type character. She was an obsession with manga , video games , and anime. She considers her self an otaku. She dislikes things like school work and normal books. She at first was somewhat interesting but she became repetitive and annoying. She like all the characters of this anime did not change at all throughout the entire show. Her sole purpose was to be relatable to all the male watchers and reference anime frequently. \\n\\n\r\nNext we have the purple haired twins Kagami and Tsukasa. Tsukasa is an airhead and overall boring character. And Kagami is smart and reliable for example Konata and Tsukasa constantly copy homework from her. \\n\\n\r\nThe main problem with the characters are how static they are. They are always very predictable. Sometimes they were able  to create good humor but often anything funny was repeated constantly till it became annoying. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style was not my taste at all. It was very colorful but it often lacked detail. This especially could be seen by the background characters who were often just black silhouettes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best things about this show was the quality of the English dub. All of the voices for the main characters sounded very fitting for each character. But most of the music was bland and forgettable. Some of the ending themes had songs from other anime which was alright. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest problems was the shows attempt at comedy. I have seen a good amount of anime and played lots of video games so i get most of the references. But these little references did not add much comedy. The show just failed to make me laugh. I think I laughed about 5 times throughout the whole 24 episodes. For a comedy without a plot this is a huge problem since im not laughing nor enjoying a good story the show seemed very pointless. \\n\\n\r\nThe only people i can recommend this show to are the people who are addicted to shows full of moe and just want to watch a group of girls acting like girls. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "You know these jokes that are getting better each time they're mentioned? Lucky Star is something like this. At first I thought it's boring and for me also pretty hard to watch (I'm from Poland and I watch animes with english subtitles), but then it was getting better and better each episode. Last ten episodes I was watching with constant smile.\r\nMost of the jokes in Lucky Star are ones about japanese grammar and culture and also about otaku, anime, doujins and stuff like this, especially Haruhi and Full Metal Panic. Reading this you can probably see that this anime is good for people that havewatched some series and know basics of japanese culture, language and standard motives in anime. Characters in this series are introducet to the end, for example girl who draws doujins and is a base of most yuri jokes is introduced in like 16th or 18th episode, suprisingly close to the end of series.\\n\r\nSome little tips: if you want to watch this and you're new with anime, just watch Haruhi Suzumiya no Yuuutsu and Full Metal Panic, especially series Fumoffu. With these two you should understand most of the jokes in Lucky Star. There are also references to Code Geass and many more, I also probably didn't get all the jokes, but still I understand why this series have cult around them (god, I hope it doesn't sound oddly in english). Ok, that's all. Go, watch, enjoy!",

It's not supposed to be a serious, action-packed, dramatised series, no no, it's basically an anime with various parodies, such as Haruhi Suzumiya, and even Initial D.\r\nThis anime will have a Love/Hate relationship with you, you either Love it, or Hate it, and for this review, I love it.\r\nMainly because this anime reminds me of school life where I'd just talk with friends at school, in a sense, I'm a bit like Konata, one of the main Heroines of Lucky Star, as I just like to talk about random things,game a lot, and cram a day before tests.\\n\\n\r\nAnd because of this, this anime has really grew on me, as an anime, I truly enjoyed, and not because of its influential power as a popular anime.\\n\\n\r\nTo truly enjoy this anime, you will have to first watch the animes it parodies, Initial D and Haruhi Suzumiya no Yuuutsu being two of them. And when you do see the scenes where it parodies, is where you will truly understand what this show is about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs stated, you'd either Love or Hate it.

            "content": "Lucky Star is great and the story line is very simple, four high school students going about there daily lives, studying, watching anime and reading manga, talking about food, going shopping, or what they do best sit around and talk to each other and music plays in the background. It is a funny and the animation is really cute. I love how different anime references pop in once in a while, like shuffle!, and the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya.\r\nLucky Star is my favourite anime, I have seen every episode many times and it doesn't get old. The best thing about it is you can watchany episode you want in any order and it wont mess up the story line at all. (My favourite episode is 6 Fixtures of Summer).\\n\\n\r\nI don't think there are many bad things about Luck Star. The one thing I didn't like was, the manga isn't as funny as the anime. They change topic and scene so fast you can't tell when the day changes in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very different from each other. Konata Izumi is a blue haired otaku and loves games, anime, and manga. She doesn't like to study and would rather play. Tsukasa Hiiragi is the younger twin out of her and her sister Kagami Hiiragi, Tsukasa likes to sleep, cook, and text on her mobile phone. She doesn't like horror movies or school work. Kagami Hiiragi is the older twin and studies hard, played shooter games, and reading light novels. Kagami is always in a different class then the rest of her friends and goes to there class everyday to eat lunch with them. Miyuki Takara is a tall, pink haired, cute girl that where glasses due to the fact that she tried reading in the dark when she was younger. Miyuki is a good student, likes to read novels, but doesn't like the dentist at all and is an only child.\\n\\n\r\nLucky Star is a great anime and I really recommend it.",

            "content": "Wow, this is pretty painful to write.\r\nFor those of you familiar with me, you have probably seen that I enjoy a lot of comedies, even if they were not as well written or clever as the more popular ones. I certainly felt the same way about Lucky Star for a long time, but ever since I begun re-watching it recently, I am starting to see now that I have no idea why I loved this anime so much back in the day.\r\nThat is to say, I only modestly enjoy it now. Due to having a bias for random comedies and the Slice of Life genre,I can not really give this anime a score lower than neutral and that may mean you should read another review for something more stern. However, my opinion for this anime changed changed as recently as, well, today. I was re-watching it carefree, enjoying the humor it had to offer and felt a little nostalgic, given Lucky Star is among the first anime that started my renaissance to the medium, as well as solidifying my interest in the Comedy and Slice of Life genres. And for that, I will always be grateful for it.\\n\\n\r\nBut now, having seen most of the reviews that this anime has from non-bias fans, my view towards Lucky Star has changed drastically. I had still considered it a high point in the industry, given it did come around 2007 with a bunch of other hits, but now the humor suddenly feels the way everyone says it does; that being boring, uninspired and generic. Indeed, I do love the two genres I mentioned a mere paragraph ago, but that bias can only extend so far when something suddenly feels off after someone guides you the right direction. And since I am of that rare breed of reviewers that looks at both the positive and negative sides of an anime, I will do just that right now. As usual, beginning with the side that has the least to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nI still enjoy the fun nature of the girls, some of the things they talk about and the soundtrack is fitting of their conversations. I like how the animation can look pretty fluid at times to make a situation seem more natural, something that I applauded K-On for doing a lot.\\n\\n\r\nWill not really go on too long about the negatives here since you have read a lot of the other reviews already, but I will just say that the comedy feels like it aged poorly. Relying on everyday life and reference humor will result in any work feeling outdated if given enough time, and Lucky Star is now over a decade old, but was still pretty fresh back when I first saw it. The characters are definitely lifeless if you look at the anime from an objective standpoint. But again, I find myself still kind of enjoying their antics every now and then, simply because of my aforesaid bias. Heh, guess you would call my side a subjective standpoint then. Maybe you should just read one of the more stern reviews, cause I am not even sure if I am even helping your cause anymore.\\n\\n\r\nFor real, though, Lucky Star is an anime that I would not go so far as to say you should avoid it. But, it is also not something I am going to say you should jump all over immediately. If you really want to see the bare bones of a Comedy and Slice of Life, then Lucky Star will certainly fulfill that interest. It doesn't get more simple than it and its offerings will neither overwhelm you or feel lackluster if you are a recent anime watcher.\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing I will note is that I feel offended that most reviews I have seen of Lucky Star, this website or not, call a lot of people idiots, lolicons, weeaboos (you can't really say that last one if you watch anime yourself) or all of the above for enjoying Lucky Star. Let me tell you right now that you should ignore any review on any website that insults you like that, provided you are a fan of Lucky Star; because you are still allowed to freely enjoy any anime of your liking and you should not change your tastes because of someone else. They belong to you and you alone. If you watch something they watch and you think it is bad, then you are obviously not one of them.\\n\\n\r\nGo enjoy Lucky Star if it is your favorite anime. If everyone still judges you for that, well, at least you're watching something you personally enjoy and that is all that should matter. And I will just say that my opinion is among the most unpopular of any website, considering I still hate SHnY to this day, but have surprisingly come across other anime worse than it over the years. So, lots of people give me mean looks, but I just brush them off. And if you are new to Lucky Star, well, I guess it is up to you. Do you want to explore your tastes or follow the cool crowd? The choice is up to you! I would recommend the former of those two since it certainly helped me, well, watch anime at all.",

I was really disappointed to learn that it is a genuinely shit show and I was just surrounded by pathetic body pillow-clutching weaboos who actually liked it.\r\nStory\r\nThere is none. It's supposed to be like a slice of life sitcom I guess so itwould get a pass here, if it had actually accomplished anything it tried to do. Instead of story, I'll rate the comedy, since that was the main purpose of the show. I was told this show was funny. It is not. Every joke is like an ironic joke meant to poke fun at what kind of moron would actually enjoy hearing it, except its genuine, and the jokes are just genuinely not funny at all. And if you're going to tell awful jokes, at least rapid fire them and hope a couple are good. This show dragged the jokes on for excruciating periods in which I could only hope for the divine salvation of the grave. Every moment in this god forsaken dumpster fire is an exercise in eclipsing dullery.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nAre you kidding me? It's like they barely tried. Could they not afford anti-aliasing? The jaggies are everywhere. Scenes where there is no animation except eyes blinking abound. It is staggeringly obvious that, like western reality television, the show was produced at the absolute bottom of the barrel minimal effort cost, with the knowledge that there are enough fools with no taste whatsoever in the world to easily recuperate such a low cost. Also all the characters look like they are 5 years old for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nEvery character has a shrill grating voice in both the sub and the dub. Listening to the American girl's voice in the EN dub is torture, plain and simple. Scored 3 instead of 1 because the OP was catchy enough to meme this awful bargain bin show into financial success.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nScores a 2 because even though a bland cast of stereotypes with literally no comedic synergy that give you no reason to care about them deserve less than a 1, at least their bland cardboard personalities actually match their bland cardboard appearances.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nEvery moment spent on this show was torment.",

Now most people will instantly say \"Drop that moe Garbage\", however, this show has a certain charm to it. I won't go into extreme detail however, this show always has me coming back. Between the constant KyoAni references to their other works (the melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and some Full Metal Panic!) and other popular shows in general, this show almost has something for everyone. I keep finding myself enjoying it more and more each and every time because eachtime I watch, I am more knowledgeable of stuff it references. Other than the plot just consisting of generic moe cute girls doing cute things, the show is really enjoyable and has a fun cast of characters.",

I don't really understand why I love this anime so much, it could be because of the artwork, which I personally find appealing. It has that cheery, happy feeling that you don't often get in anime. When I watch Lucky \u2606 Star, it always leaves me feeling very happy!\r\nBut though all the greatness of this, I still have minor issues. I don't mind the storyline not having much development, because that is one of the big characteristics that makes this anime unique, but I dislike the fact that thereis only a small amount of character development. For me, if this anime had romance in it, I would have rated it a full 10 marks. But that is the ONLY thing that let it down for me.\\n\\n\r\nI love this anime though, with all my heart. I also believe that you can watch this anime again, and again, and again. That is the amazing factor that the storyline brings.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I recommend this anime to anyone, not just because it is awesome, but because Konata Izumi is AWESOME. :D",

            "content": "Lucky Star at a glance is a typical SoL anime about a group of junior high-school girls that makes tons of references and jokes about other anime and manga such as Gundam, Pokemon, and Sgt. Frog. It has a very light-hearted but also comedic aspect behind it which I find people either loving it or hating it.\r\nStory 3/10\r\nIts not that the story was bad its the lack of one. SoL's are normally like this so I'm not real to fed up with this at all. Each episode entails of mostly random conversations between the main cast of characters and really minor sub-plots. The main focusis directed towards the comedy than anything else. It makes a fine work of making you laugh. I don't think there was an episode where I didn't laugh at some point.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nThe art style was pretty solid overall. They made fine work of taking you across a few different titles art styles which I found pretty cool. Its not everyday you see a shift in style in an anime so it was pretty refreshing to see that. The character design was very well done. I enjoyed every character in terms of design very kawaii for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nThis is one of the best OST's I have ever heard. For starters, the OP was drop dead amazing and very catchy. Episode 1-14 always featured the cast of characters singing a random song at the end of each episode. I found that very cute as always. The rest had a live action ED which was so hilarious. I could not stop laughing at the end of each episode. Totally something I wish I had a CD for.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nThe main four girls of the series can be related to if you watch a lot of anime or manga. The confection between audience and character was made to grab your attention from the start and thats something a lot of writers aren't good at but this series in particular has done a fine job with that. I felt right at home when watching the interactions between them. Though as with story, there was hardly any character development.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nThis was a very good series but this is not something you should try to marathon. While I am going against myself here this anime has a casual feel and is meant to be enjoyed when you need a fresh relief from reality and a good laugh now and then. It is also very much so good to watch with friends as I did. I highly recommend it to anyone willing to take a break from very action packed shounens and such anime.",

            "content": "Lucky Star is known as the Anime that makes no sense at all. It's said that it is an Anime about noting and still, it has a really high fanbase. Why is that?\r\nStory: Well...it is really hard to score this for Lucky Star, since the only story there is, is some girls going to school. There is no real plot, but only random scenes out of the life of the main characters. There is no drama, no death, only comedy. Nothing else.\r\n?/10\r\nCharacters: This is just as hard to score, but this time I will give it a try. The characters are the typical characters fora moe-show. There is the crazy one, the agressive one, the smart one and the clumsy one and all of them are cute.\\n\r\nWe have Izumi Konata. She is the typical lazy Otaku, playing Light Novel, MMOs, console games, reading Manga and watching Anime. She has a really sarcastic humor and is the main idsentification of the show.\\n\r\nHiragi Tsukasa is the clumsy one of the whole group. She breaks everything and is neither smart nor gifted in anything but being cute.\\n\r\nHiragi Kagami is the contrary to here twin sister Tsukasa. She is really good in school since she is studying a lot and gets angry quickly.\\n\r\nTakara Miyuki is the smart one. She is really clever and knows almost everything. Still she is almost as clumsy as Tsukasa and just as kind.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: Lucky Star has been produced by Kyoto Animation, who had many major works, such as the almost every key adaption (Clannad, Air, Kannon 2006), K-on and the Haruhi Suzumiya franchise. The style of the show is really moe. The girls who are supposed to be 17 look as if they were still in elementary school and even the mature ones look this way. The Animation is quite good, given that this is a slice of life comedy Anime.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is ok. The Soundtrack has nothing special in particular. The Opening though is even if it is really annoying one of the most addicting ones ever and I found myself listening to only this song for over an hour. The ending on the other hand is not definable, since it always is diferent and always for the purpose of comedy (sometimes it really is incredibly hillarious)\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\npersonal enjoyment: This Anime is hillarious. That's why has that much of a fanbase. It basically has no plot and no sense, but the comedy is so well done that you just have to laugh out loud. It has one problem though, and that is nothing that really gets the score down, but something that might be annoying to some. To be able to watch Lucky Star, you should have seen the whole Haruhi Suzumiya franchise (except movie), since there are so many references about it that it actually will be a lot less funny if you don't know it. Of course there are other Otaku references too, but not as siginifcant as this.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nI LOVE THIS ANIME. It's official now. Lucky Star is incredibly funny, but has too many flaws to really give it full points. The plot is nothing that really is missing and I love the fact that it doesn't take Anime seriously at all. The Anime is done for those Otaku's who actually know a lot about the Otaku scene.\\n\r\nIn total: 8/10",

            "content": "Critic's Log - Earthdate: March 17, 2013. Review #41: Lucky Star\r\n*I Breathe in and sigh heavily* I was afraid this day would come... Let's get this over with... Here's... *Sigh*  Lucky Star...\r\nLucky Star is about the lives of several school girls attending a Japanese high school. The main heroine is Konata Izumi, an athletic and intelligent girl who, despite these attributes, is not in a sports club, and her grades remain low. Her laziness at school is due to her enthusiasm for anime and video games, and she is not interested in anything else much.\r\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...... ... ... Yeah, that's the plot *Sigh* We're screwed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo be technical, this is a Kyoto Animation production and they were known for their high production values especially with a popular anime such as The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. For Lucky Star being a comedy, the art style is intentional and I can honestly say that the character designs do look good. The character designs are both colorful and cute. I know it's odd that I'm saying this but it's true. It is kinda odd that these high school students look like middle school students. The animation is nice but not perfect.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe music by Satoru Kousaki is kind of forgettable and that's all I can say about this topic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to voice acting, the Japanese cast is terrific and really makes the voices sound fitting. Aya Hirano is terrific as Konata, Emiri Kato is great as Kagami, Kaori Fukuhara is also great as Tsukasa, and Aya Endo is also great as Miyuki. The standout extras in the subbed version include Fumihiko Tachiki which he got to have 62 minor roles in this show. Damn, why so many!? Jouji Nakata, Minoru Shiraishi as Minoru Shiraishi, Tomokazu Seki as Meito Anisawa and Hiromi Konno as Akira Kogami. On the English Dub side, Wendee Lee was chosen to play Konata because of the fact that Aya Hirano plays both Haruhi Suzumiya and Konata Izumi and Wendee Lee does play the nerdy girl type extremely well but I think Hirano-san perfected the role. Wendee Lee is great as Konata. Kari Wahlgren is terrific as Kagami, Karen Strassman is great as Miyuki, and Michelle Ruff is pretty good as Tsukasa. The standout extras in the dub include Kate Higgens as Miss Kuroi, Stephanie Sheh as Akira Kogami, Lex Lang as Meito Anisawa, Derek Stephen Prince and Richard Epcar for both having more than 25 roles in the same show...Damn! To be honest, if you want to have a more fitting version in cultural settings, go with the subs on this one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters, the characters are very memorable but don't expect character development for any of these characters but since this anime has the spirit of a sitcom. Sitcoms don't specialize in character development so I wasn't expecting this much on Lucky Star. I hope my analogy of Lucky Star and sitcoms made sense.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to plot...te he he... what plot? ha ha ha, THERE'S NO DAMN PLOT TO THIS SHOW! IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS TALKING ABOUT CERTAIN TOPICS! Again, sitcoms have this kind of formula but there are times when an episode is boring as hell. The first episode may have been a cute starter but it was hardly funny. Gee, NICE FIRST IMPRESSION STAFF! NICE FIRST IMPRESSION! To be honest, the approach is giving the show a familiar environment for the viewer that is very common in schools. High school students just talking about random shit, that's pretty damn basic. The show does have an aimless plot for having no plot at all whatsoever. This can be Lucky Star's biggest turn-off factors in the show. The thing is... We all have our own groups and have our own conversations, we kinda see what Lucky Star was trying to invoke with that similar approach, but I had a hard time liking Lucky Star because of its slow pacing and dialogue. Another turn-off factor could be that IT'S MOSTLY INVOLVES PEOPLE TALKING. Also, the \"Lucky Channel\" segments are ok but I found some of the segments a little pointless. Putting all that ranting aside, some of the jokes aren't bad and Lucky Star has a cutesy appeal. Is this show really all that bad? That would all depend on what you're interested in I guess. Is Lucky Star worth seeing? In all honesty... Yes! I am under the assumption that this is a show that is giving Anime fans a tribute because of their enthusiasm towards Anime. Could Lucky Star be a little shorter than what it is? I guess. Is Lucky Star overrated? That's for you to decide. I personally felt that Lucky Star to me was kind of a test on patience, there were times when I was bored while watching it and I'm not the only one that said it was a boring show. Some people even say it's overrated... Well, NO SHIT! I have seen shows that were funnier than this half-funny and half-boring show. I am better off watching The Blues Brothers after watching Lucky Star, I am better off playing video games like Zelda, Mario, and Final Fantasy. I'm better off watching Hetalia more than once instead of watching Lucky Star more than once. AANNNNDD! I AM BETTER OFF WATCHING MY LITTLE PONY: FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC COUNTLESS TIMES WITHOUT GETTING BORED THAN WATCHING LUCKY STAR COUNTLESS TIMES AND GETTING BORED!!! I'M THE FULLMETAL COWBOY AND I'M GOING OUT TO THE CHINESE RESTAURANT NEAR WHERE I LIVE THAT IS ALSO CALLED \"LUCKY STAR\" SO I CAN FORGET THAT I WATCHED THE ENTIRETY OF LUCKY STAR! I GOT MORE BETTER THINGS TO DO THAN RE-WATCH THIS!!!\\n\\n\r\nWhew, I also need to take my medication. My apologies. Allow me to re-phrase that. Lucky Star does deserve to been seen. If you want to watch the whole thing, be my guest. This is an anime that I think should be seen but has that \"Once is enough\" watch value, whether it's an episode, or the entire show.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nLucky Star was available by Bandai Entertainment, it is out of print. The manga by Kagami Yoshimizu was also available by Bandai Entertainment and is also out of print. There has not been an American release to any Lucky Star video game to this day. The light novel series also never came stateside. A manga called \"Lucky Star Pocket Travelers\" never was released stateside. A spinoff called \"Miyakawa-ke no K\u016bfuku\" has not been released in the U.S. A spinoff light novel series called \"Yuruyuru Days\" has not been released in the U.S. either. A Lucky Star OVA however was released stateside, but unfortunately...It was licensed by Bandai Entertainment, meaning...that too is out of print.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, Lucky Star is an anime that might not hold up to everyone's expectations. It does have cutesy character designs, it does have some funny moments, and some memorable characters. It does have an aimless plot (which I'll give the staff a pass for this) but the music is forgettable and is often boring at times or maybe an entire episode. The animation however isn't really all that terrible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI give Lucky Star a 5.9 out of 10, it is SO and SO!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to comment below, now if you'll excuse me... I got some fun stuff to do, and that information is all classified. Actually, it isn't. Bye-nee!",

Whilst watching this anime, I felt as if I was reliving my high school years. \r\nI think the fact that there isn't a very focused plot line (just loosely follows the characters through their years at school), makes this anime what it is. Alot of people have a problem, when there's no goal to reach by the end of the series, but I think this anime superbly displays that you don't need a specific story to have agreat show, just everday life is enough! \\n\\n\r\nThe art work is adorable, but bright and funky at the same time. The OST's whilst simple, work really well within the anime, they perfectly reflect the characters personalities and the situation at hand. \\n\\n\r\nI have watched the series twice and certain episodes three or four times, and it just doesn't get old. I honestly don't laugh out loud at that many animes, but this one got me chuckling. \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime, I know alot of people who don't like it, I believe it's one of those shows, your going to fall absolutely head over heels in love with, or you just won't get it at all. If you cherish how special and amusing every day life is, then you must watch this anime!",

            "content": "Have you ever wondered what it would be like to listen to random conversations in an anime? And what would happen if this would make up the majority of said anime? Combined with goofy characters and a pretty loose story, Lucky Star fulfills your need for complete randomness.\r\nNow, the first episode might scare you away, thinking that it's going to be a boring anime that focuses on trivial things. Well, it does. But as you keep watching, you'll notice that you can't stop. Why? Well, it's difficult to explain. I mean, there's no actual story other than some loose mini-stories here and there, and oftenit's just random goofing around. But why do we keep watching? Well, it's probably because this pretty much resembles the average life of a high schooler. I mean, when was the last time you were actually having a serious conversation with (high) school friends? The reason the concept of this anime works is because it subconsciously reminds us of the time we had at high school, just hanging about, talking about random stuff. And even though the subjects vary so much, it's because of the variation and the comments during their discussions what makes it a fun anime. Not to mention the cute and silly characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs for characters, there's a bunch of them. The most famous one is Konata Izumi, who resembles your average Otaku/MAL user (in the best way possible). She's lazy, barely sleeps, plays games, reads manga, watches anime, doesn't care about school, and has fun with friends. A perfect resemblance if you ask me, and they did a great job on her character, facial expressions and voice casting. (The English voices aren't that great though imo, sorry. Stick to Japanese)\\n\r\nThen, we got the Hiiragi sisters, Tsukasa and Kagami. They're twins, although they don't look the same (which is even explained in the anime, that's how random the subjects can be), and their personalities are completely different. Kagami is a serious, hard-working type that can't stand how Konata is always so carefree, whereas Tsukasa sleeps in all the time, is timid and a bit shy sometimes, and doesn't really do schoolwork that much either, kinda like Konata.\\n\r\nAnd last of our main cast, we have Miyuki, who's pretty much the cutest walking encyclopedia ever, as she knows pretty much every (trivial) thing there is. She's also a bit timid and shy like Tsukasa, and once again the voice casting for her is nicely picked, as her voice matches her personality perfectly.\\n\r\nWe also got a whole bunch of side-characters, including Yui (Konata's cousin), Yutaka (Yui's younger sister), and many more. I won't go into these characters too much as the focus is mainly on the four characters mentioned before. I do have to admit that each side-character has their silly and funny traits, like the perverted manga artist.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is simple, but really nice and cute. It goes very well with the overall feel of the anime, and they couldn't have done a better job on the expressions. The music is well... Repetitive and slightly dull-ish, but it keeps the anime well-balanced in my opinion, not making it too forced and in-your-face-cute.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, The Lucky Channel. I love this bit. A lot. I can barely describe how much I just love the weird stuff that goes on at the end of the anime with Akira and Minoru, how they bicker, how Akira the idol goes all old-lady all the time, how the karaoke bit at the end got replaced by Minoru IRL, how Minoru plays himself in the anime and the way he talks and acts. I don't know, it's just something I kept looking forward to when I went through each episode. It's kinda like a BD/DVD special, except that it's included with each episode. Safe to say, a lot of fun.\\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion, Lucky Star is random, silly, cute, funny, interesting, odd, awkward, and many more things. I had trouble writing this review as I couldn't really find a starting point. It's not an anime to take seriously, or to really even think about. It's something you watch with your common sense turned off, as you sit there smiling and laughing about all the silly things happening in the show. It's a recommendation if you're into all that, and if not, I seriously recommend giving it a shot to see if the randomness will latch onto you. It sure did for me.",

I think you need a good attention span to watch this anime though because there is a lot of talking which isn't bad but for some people I'm sure reading so much subtitles would turn them off to it.",

            "content": "When I think of Lucky Star, I think of brainless entertainment. \r\nStory: Really it isn't the story that gets the ranking of an 8, it's more the concept. Not many shows take this kind of theme. The theme is brainless, but it is entertaining. It takes conversations that we have in our daily lives and turns them into an anime, thus we have Lucky Star. What's actually funny about this series is how much people can relate their stories to real life experiences. I mean, who hasn't had a 5 minute conversation about how they eat certain foods or something along those lines? In factsince I started watching Lucky Star I've noticed myself having those kinds of conversations and I tend to laugh and think \"Lucky Star moment.\" So Lucky Star for me has actually leaked over a bit into my life and even when I'm not watching, it has provided me with a bit of a chuckle. This just goes to show life can be entertaining if you look closely enough at it from the Lucky Star standpoint. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art wasn't horrible, but it was a typical style. There isn't much to be said about it except the expressions during different situations made me laugh. Nothing better than anime expressions. \\n\\n\r\nSound: To be truthful, I don't remember much about the music except for the theme song. I admit, I love the theme song. As hard as I try though, I don't really recall what the music sounds like. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I believe we all have a character we can relate to in this series, probably most of us relate to Konota more than any of them. I like each character for their own personality and it didn't seem like any one character was better than another, each had their own pros and cons.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This was a good anime to wind down the day with that doesn't need much energy to enjoy. This is just what I need after a long day at school working my brain to death. It got boring at times, but overall it was an enjoyable series. Just not the kind of series for people who like a complex storyline. If you're multi-tasking or about to go to sleep and want something light hearted, Lucky Star is your anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I can see how people like this series and I can also see why people would dislike this series. It's not really an anime to watch for excitement, action, romance, or anything of that nature. It's more for comedy that can make you laugh out loud or put a smile on your face. Nothing more and nothing less. So key tip, don't mean to beat a dead horse, but if you're looking for complexity or a story line, you may want to look elsewhere or you'll just be wasting time.",

            "content": "Hey people! Here's my second review. This time I picked something very easy to review and see how it goes from now on. Anime in question is Lucky\u2606Star, a slapstick comedy presenting the lives of a few completely normal high school girls. Well, not that normal, but let's see further.\r\nLucky\u2606Star is one of those light-hearted anime that give you less than what you would call a story and more than what you would call laughing stocks. it's a baseless comedy that only comes to us once in a year. An anime one of a kind, with interesting characters to say the least.\r\nStory - 6\r\nProtagonist KonataIzumi enjoying otaku life to the fullest and teasing the -bleep- out of everyone. This is the story of Lucky\u2606Star, with a few good pointers here and there. Honestly though, even if you decide to watch the anime starting from episode 1-5 so that all characters are introduced and then decide to watch all other episodes backwards then you will have noticed no difference. Skipping episodes like no problem ftw! (although I wouldn't suggest doing so)\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8 \\n\\n\r\nCharacters really representing the light mood of the anime, being basically full lolis in high school with some pretty fun expressions that make you laugh out so loud that the neighbouring town can hear you. Backgrounds are nothing amazing, just what needs to be there to make the scenes feel good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is what deserves extreme praise here. Much variety on the voices of the characters shows the uniqueness of each one giving some form of completeness there as well. Big props to Kona-chan's seiyuu, Fukuhara Kaori, acting the voice I love so freakin much! Opening theme, \"Motteke! Sailor Fuku\" sung by the 4 seiyuu of the main characters is pretty catchy and definitely suits the mood. Although it gets a bit boring after 15 or so episodes so I skipped it from there on. Now comes another surprising feat that not many anime have achieved so far. Lucky\u2606Star has 24 ending themes. Yes you read right, twenty-four, writing that in letters as well so that I'm perfectly clear. To be honest, I haven't listened to all of them so I can't judge whether they are good, fitting, bad or whatever else you may think of. But only the variety that this brought made the anime all the more enjoyable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\\n\r\nLet's admit it, Lucky\u2606Star has a crapton of characters, whilst not making them the same not even a bit. Character versatility is not so key in slapstick, but it feels nice to have.\\n\\n\r\nKonata Izumi - The main character of the series and definitely the funniest one out of them all. She is a hardcore otaku, raised by her father alone (a lolicon at that) who taught her all the things about being one. She has a brilliant mind which she uses to excel at games and thinking about and discussing anime. She loves playing the oh so popular in Japan MMORPG games, but also likes console gaming. Of course, you are not a proper otaku if you don't go to a manga store at least twice per week and watching anime every day, and gaming all night. She has a tendency to pick on everyone and throw out jokes every minute. She especially likes to pick on Hiiragi Kagami, despite being in different classes. Having said all that, Konata is easily one HUGE troll.\\n\\n\r\nHiiragi Kagami - The tsundere of the series, she is my favorite character because, well, she is a tsundere. The only one out of a company of 4 who is in a different class. My guess is she feels left out so that must be the reason why she is in Konata's classroom every single break of every single day. She has a twin, who is a few seconds younger, so that makes Kagami feel like an older sister, so she is responsible. In contrast to Konata's immature nature, she is very mature, studying hard and always telling Konata to do so as well, although Konata is ignoring her or teasing her as an answer. Like all characters in this anime, she has her solo moments but she makes the best moments in combination with Konata, with the latter mainly teasing her.\\n\\n\r\nHiiragi Tsukasa - Enter airhead #1, Tsukasa Hiiragi. She is the younger twin of the two, the other one being Kagami of course, and she definitely acts like it. Her character has no special traits other than the fact that she gets overexcited and worked up easily, and she is trying her best to match her sister, failing miserably at that. Being an airhead, she is a great target for Konata to make fun of and the two have great moments of fun, with Konata having the most of it.\\n\\n\r\nTakara Miyuki - Airhead #2 and school prodigy, Miwiki-chan! Her nickname is Miwiki because whenever she gets asked something by Konata, she always has the right answer/advice to give. She is very intelligent, hard working and the only one with actual cleavage in the whole anime. Fact is, she gets distracted really easily by small things and can't see in front of her nose without her glasses. Since she has a very large vocabulary she serves for making good puns and great admiration material for Konata. She is the one who gets teased the least out of the 4 but when she does get teased, she gets teased hard, which brings balance to the teasing levels Konata wants to have.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty, this is one of the anime that will make your stomach hurt from laughing from all the jokes being thrown at you. Personally, I can't count the times I just bursted out laughing from a random joke that was thrown at a completely random place and time. I can't remember the last time I've laughed so much watching anime. The parody level is over 9000, so many refferences that you need an encyclopedia to actually understand every single one. I enjoyed this anime immensly and I have to say I'm not proud to have watched it so late in my anime watching days.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRewatchability - 10\\n\\n\r\nAs with my previous review, rewatchability is added as a bonus factor that is not determinant to the overall score. So, if you wanna laugh at the jokes thrown in your face every 90 seconds, then this is definitely the anime for you. Rewatchability is really viable in this because it contains no spoilers and its basically a joke dumpster where you can laugh repeatedly. The jokes are so many that you are never going to remember every single one so rewatching it has no negative impact in your viewing pleasure whatsoever.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\\n\r\nLoved it. Adored it. Konata is the best. Kagami is boss. I recommend this anime to everyone who has the slightest sense of humour. You will not be disappointed.",

Actually, you know what? This anime is nothing special at all and here's the reasons why. I think the show is about a bunch of girls from school talking about stuff that makes me wanna go to sleep. All I've seen in this anime are justthese characters having random conversations while making references to manga. I also find the voices to be dreadful that I would rather listen to a dying dinosaur screaming so, it can give my ears bleed. The designs make me disgusted and the animation looks like someone did cocane. The characters in the show are pathetic and I don't see why people would call them hot.

Lucky Star taught me that even with a very bad or no plot at all it could manage to be fun and entertaining...\\n\\n\r\nBut then you'd ask... what about naruto filler ? Well...lucky star can be as bad as it, but for the record, lucky star never managed to do more than it had initially proposed, naruto in the other hand, did everything to be a great show but got watered down latter because of the fillers. This never happens to lucky star.\\n\\n\r\nFILLERLESS, this one is my favorite, how can you distinguish an episode being a filler if the whole series is plotless ? Or everything is filler then ? Or just some scenes of the episode were filler ? like lucky channel for instance ? \\n\\n\r\nLucky star contradicts itself many and many times, with extremely boring scenes at times and amazing and awesome scenes at other times...but the jokes are always crappy...and then i started to ask myself ? did they made this on purpose ?\\n\\n\r\nLUCKYCHANNEL\\n\r\nThis is one of the most annoying thing about lucky star, believe me, i was throwing stuff at my TV when it showed off at the begininng , i even thought it was a filler to take the rest of the episode's screen time... but as a big surprise, it caught my attention latter on and i was requiring it to show off every time !\\n\\n\r\nSo how can a show be contradictory on purpose and exhibits AMAZING scenes along with CRAPPY ones and AWFUL jokes and still manage to keep the watchers attention ALL the time ?\\n\\n\r\nThat is the magic of this show...Its episodes are totally random, and at times i could identify with the scenes, situations and characters (did i mention konata ?) but at others i was totally dull and thinking about how crappy those girls really are...but in a blink of an eye, the scene changes and i was back there...totally interested in it, but a few minutes latter, dull again.\\n\\n\r\nA roller coaster experience ? yes, every episode is just like one, i think this is the best comparison, slow and boring climbing, and fast and amazing fall...then some loops around it self, end a nice and smooth end... all of this just in ONE EPISODE.\\n\\n\r\nWhat happens to us when we just ride a roller coaster ? want to ride again ! of course, if you can get over with this aspect of lucky star (boring climbing, amazing fall, smooth end) you will get tons of entertaining !\\n\\n\r\nLater On in the series, instead of showing some crappy anime song ending, they did the unthinkable... showing an even more crappy \"live\" song ending with real actors... just to show how creative this series is...and of course, didn't like in the beginning but was willing to watch it later ;)\\n\\n\r\nI thought a lot about how to rate this series...mainly because it does not have plot, but four things managed to make me give the MASTERPIECE = *** = 10 rating, here it goes:\\n\\n\r\n* Izumi Konata\\n\r\n* Episode Randomness (Filler that is worth watching)\\n\r\n* Hilarious Scenes (not the jokes however)\\n\r\n* Contradictions on purpose\\n\\n\r\nLucky Star is a prof that you can't judge an anime for its firsts couple of episodes alone, and you must give a fair chance to really enjoy them, plus, plotless animes can have some big value and of course you mustn't take it seriously, because it is bad on purpose.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a TRUE and VALUABLE review and opinion of MINE, don't get confused about my crappy Clannad After Story Review ;)",

            "content": "I am the odd one out when it comes to lucky star. I just hope none of you mind you own personal opinion of the show.\r\nWell here we go...\r\nStory:1- Well to be quite honest, there is no actual story. From what I could gather, girls who look like they are 7(who are actually 18) talk in ear piercing voices about things that are insignificant. That's it.\r\nArt:7- I'll admit lucky star has a unique art style which actually looks good. It's unique and colourful as all hell.\r\nSound:5- the theme is annoyingly catchy and some of the background music is good. But the voice actors were probablysome of the worst I've ever seen.(I watched the dub...I regret that)\\n\r\nCharacters:2- the characters in lucky star were not good in the slightest. All of them just a big collection of stereotypes in a school. Whilst all sounding like there in their 50s...\\n\r\nEnjoyment:3- I felt myself being bored by the awful voices talking about food......FOR 24 FU**ING MINUTES!!!\\n\r\nNext episode, girl likes games. Oh boy what hilarity is gonna ensue here?\\n\r\nNothing happens. It's like this for the rest of the series.\\n\r\nThe only thing that redeemed the show was lucky channel. Which I thought was hilarious.\\n\r\nOverall:3- lucky star isn't terrible. But it isn't,'the best anime ever made'(as said by some of its fans). I probably just didn't like the genre but if you enjoyed it that's fine. I didn't like It that much.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading,",

            "content": "Lucky Star is not the type of show that particularly looked interesting to me at first glance. It\u2019s Girly, it\u2019s cute, and it\u2019s certainly not my thing. The reason I started to watch the show is because of the opinions surrounding it. I\u2019d been looking up reviews of the show and I wanted to be able to formulate an opinion of it. Another reason why I was interested in Lucky Star was curiosity. It\u2019s sort of like how a gamer might want to play Superman 64. It\u2019s an absolutely rubbish game, and most gamers much well know that, but as a curious gamer with apassion for the video game medium, it\u2019s not unlikely that someone like me might want to play it anyway. I went into Lucky Star knowing that I probably wouldn\u2019t like it, but I watched it anyway because I love anime in general and I wanted to experience Lucky Star.\\n\\n\r\nInto the actual show, Lucky Star is an anime about the lives of four teenage girls. The girls just live out their everyday lives... and that\u2019s honestly about it. Sounds, boring doesn\u2019t it? Well, it\u2019s not the boring everyday events themselves that make the show, but more the way the events are expressed on screen. It tries to put itself out there using its cuteness factor, different camera angles, certain animation effects and overall puts more emphasis on what seem to be just ordinary things. What we get from this is a simple, yet over the top anime that shows us that life really is stranger than fiction. Some would call this ingenious.\\n\\n\r\nI think that from an art and filmmaking perspective, the show succeeds immensely, but when I look at the show realistically it seems a lot harder to find entertainment value as it should be, but overall the show was good enough to make me want to watch the entire 24 episode series, so I shouldn\u2019t be complaining too much.\\n\\n\r\nLucky star can be a very funny show and the anime and game references and parodies I particularly enjoyed, but at the same time, the show can end up being incredibly lame, especially during the first episode. The beginning of a show is supposed to hook you in, but surprisingly, the first episode was one of the worst in the series for me which is very strange. \\n\\n\r\nNow, if you\u2019re going to make a show with such a miniscule plot, you\u2019d think that it would be vital to have an engaging cast of characters and a well written script. Thankfully, Lucky Star has just that. Each character has their own unique personality and ways of thinking and behaving. I won\u2019t explain the characters personalities and traits because I feel that I would be ruining one of the most important aspects of the anime. Lucky Star focuses on character development and discovery, and learning more about these characters is good and can sometimes be funny, but there are many lame, boring, crazy or just plain stupid moments that didn\u2019t convert as well into the lucky star formula as other moments, which sadly ruins a large portion of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI personally think that the lack of males in the show could be one reason why I didn\u2019t enjoy Lucky Star as much as I should have. People of different genders often have different lifestyles, personalities and real life issues and by introducing more males, the show\u2019s audience would broaden and the show would be more entertaining and more popular overall.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t have much else to say about Lucky Star. The animation and art is smooth, crystal clear and a joy to look at, the music, while mostly forgettable, does fit the show and it\u2019s scenes well and, with the exclusion of a few annoying voices, the dub is well performed and fits the characters well too.\\n\\n\r\nI do have to bring up one more issue though. The voices are way too high pitched and the main cast are way too small and cute. They\u2019re supposed to be sixteen at the beginning of the show and eighteen by the series finale, but they all look and sound like they\u2019re eight years old. I know I\u2019m just starting to nitpick now, but it does seem out of place to me.\\n\\n\r\nSumming things up, Lucky Star is... different to what I\u2019m used to which makes it difficult for me to properly judge and rate. This one of those things that you'll either love or love to hate, and as usual with this type of thing, I'm one of the very few people who are somewhere in between. I think Luck Star deserves all of the criticism that it gets, but at the same time deserves all of its praise too. Sort of like Mirror's Edge in the gaming world, I would recommend that you experience this anime, even if it's just for the experience, and don't just watch the first crappy episode either. Watch two or three more and if you don't like it, then that's fine, but if you do like it then that's fine as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thought that the show wasn\u2019t too bad. It had plenty of bad moments but, at the same time, it had a lot of good moments too. It\u2019s kind of embarrassing to say this but Lucky Star is a pretty good show, just not a great one, so I\u2019m giving Lucky Star a 7.5 out of 10. Funny sometimes, and a good watch to cheer you up every now and then, but this type of anime doesn't really appeal to me much, though I do recommend it for the experience. If it\u2019s a comedy you\u2019re looking for then I would recommend something like Sgt. Frog more than I would Lucky Star, but wether Lucky Star deserves its popularity or not really does depend on what you think.\\n\\n\r\nThis show isn\u2019t for everyone and that\u2019s okay and sadly, it wasn\u2019t really the type of anime for me, but despite that, I\u2019m glad I saw Lucky Star, even if it was just for the experience. I\u2019ve learned a lot about Japanese culture and about myself from watching the show and I\u2019m glad I made the decision to check it out.\\n",

            "content": "For those of you that have seen Azumanga Daioh, this is basically that. Pure random fun. I don't think I've laughed so hard since I had watched School Rumble, and that show nearly killed me. Let me just say that this show is like Azumanga Daioh, yet not like it at the same time. If you don't know what I mean by that, we're in the same boat. It's really hard to explain. It's got the same comedy that you'd find in Azumanga Daioh, but it makes it unique in some way.\r\nFor starters, let me just say that there is no story to this showat all. You will basically be watching 24 episodes + 1 OVA of pure randomness. There is no major plot in the show, but every episode kind of has it's own mini plot. The first episode doesn't have a mini plot. For example, the first 12 minutes is them talking about how they eat different kinds of foods, then it goes from there to eye doctors to the strangest end-of-show segment called \"Lucky Channel\", which, let me say, was something that I wanted to skip, but something in my mind was telling me, \"Nah man, don't skip it. Maybe it'll start making sense.\". In the end I had watched all 24 episodes and not one episode of Lucky Channel made any sense.\\n\\n\r\nI guess the artwork was unique in it's own way. I wouldn't call the characters Chibis, but they definitely had a Chibi-like personality. As for the artwork, it varied from hand drawn backdrops to photos taken by a camera. In other words, it had a Negima!? concept artwork style.\\n\\n\r\nSound was a solid 8. Patricia was probably the most high pitch voiced characters I've ever heard in any anime. Found annoying at times, but I managed to get through it. But the greatest voice actor of all was Wendee Lee. She gave Konoka the perfect voice, and the funniest thing was that the character had an obsession with Haruhi Suzumiya. For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, Wendee Lee is the voice actress of Haruhi Suzumiya as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were all hilarious. Konoka, or as her fans call her, Legendary Girl A, is a complete Otaku, like me, and I found I could relate to her in more ways then one, like the fact she crams all her studying in the night before a big test. Then there's Kagami and Tsukasa. They might have complete opposite personalities and different hair, but you can definitely tell they're twins. That was the best part. One was mean and vicious, the other, as innocent as a flower. You can find that in most animes with twins. Miyuki... pretty, smart, and like the nicest person you'll ever meet. Perfect idol. Multiple other characters will capture your heart as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, solid 10. Not one episode made me stop laughing. This show was super funny, and those who liked Azumanga Daioh, you can call this Season 2 only with different characters. Watch it. I hope this has helped you.",

No matter, Lucky Star was still interesting and humorous. The jokes were good, and the subjects that were talked about were just, weird. This show is about pretty much, nothing. No storyline, no plot. Just a bunch of girls that go to a high school. Konata was my personal favorite character. She's funny, she's cool. She also cute~!  My friends all love this anime. So, if you are looking for a funny otaku, Lucky Star would be your best bet.Thank you for taking time to read this review~!",

            "content": "TL:DR\r\nLucky\u2606Star is 9 1/2 hours of moeblob trash from moeblob specialist task force KyoAni and because I'm a moeblob loving piece of shit I liked it.\r\nNow here's a review longer than the rambling dialogue about which end of a chocolate cornet is the head.\r\nYou need to come into Lucky\u2606Star with the right idea of what to expect or you'll be disoriented and annoyed.\r\nLucky\u2606Star is self aware of what it is and who it's for.\r\nIt is packed with anime and pop culture references.\r\nIf you're a casual anime fan like myself many references will go over your head.\r\nIf you're a hardcore otaku with bodypillows of all yourfavorite loli waifus you'll get offended by the portrayal of Konata's dad, because the series takes a stab at these extremes.\\n\r\nBut if you're a seasoned anime vet that has seen a lot of shows of the time period you'll catch a ton of references from anime and pop culture.\\n\\n\r\nThe more anime you watch, the more you'll enjoy Lucky\u2606Star.\\n\r\nYou can return to it at any point in your anime watching \"career\" and be pleasantly surprised by a reference you're only catching on a second or fourth viewing.\\n\\n\r\nThe downside to this is that as this anime ages the references are going to feel a lot more dated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo what is it about?\\n\r\nNothing, and that's the beauty of it.\\n\r\nHear me out.\\n\\n\r\nDo you remember in high school that one class you hated going to because you sat between these girls that happened to be best friends, so you had to listen to them yap about random bullshit the entire time back and forth. Lucky\u2606Star is exactly that.\\n\\n\r\nSo there isn't a plot and why that's a good thing:\\n\\n\r\nThe show is really fast paced, jumping from scene to scene with no amount of transition shot or context clue as to where you are or what is going on now. Because of the fast paced scenario based humor, non existent plot, and easy to consume material this means that after an initial viewing of the series you can later on pull up any random episode after a long day and unwind.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the issue with Lucky\u2606Star is that if you tell someone to come into it  with the expectation of a sitcom, their expectations are not going to be met.\\n\\n\r\nI was told going into this series that it's like Seinfeld in anime format.\\n\r\nThat is objectively wrong, and the only similarities between the shows are rewatchability and that they are both based around character driven comedy. edit: also that both main themes have bass riffs that fucking slap.\\n\\n\r\nSeinfeld is a series of episodic plots with a conflict spanning the length of the episode that is resolved at the end. There is little to no plot in Lucky\u2606Star and thus no conflict to be resolved. The closest there ever comes to being a conflict is an argument between two sisters that is resolved in a matter of minutes.\\n\\n\r\nI think this series is something you need to at least view 5 episodes of before you make your decision whether it's worth your time or not. Initially I didn't understand the appeal, but the more I watched, the more I felt the pulse of the show and was able to enjoy it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis would not work without the right characters, so getting the girls right is important for an anime about nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a group of friends just going about their lives and their dynamic is where the comedy in the show comes from; Often by trying to one up each other or out snark one another. It makes for some interesting running gags and the characters get better at making up comebacks as the series goes on. Some jokes are overused and if you're watching it all in one sitting they will get old. \\n\\n\r\nThe end segment Lucky Channel features an idol who is frustrated because of her small part and angry that her career is leading her to washing out. This makes for some fun interactions between her and her fresh faced assistant ready to break into the industry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest gripes with the series are the art and the sound.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is really watered down to the point that the characters are fabricated solely to be moeblobs. The backgrounds are lackluster and often not even present, and the \"world\" is often filled with literal blobs to serve as a proxy for background characters. And too often the camera is placed in a shot in such a way that lip flaps or walk cycles don't need to be animated, it's really obvious when you see it and you won't be able to unsee it when you notice it. But all in all the art style grew on me.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound can be good or bad depending on the episode. I found that sometimes the background music overpowered some of the dialogue between characters. I think the English dub for this anime is actually pretty good. Konata's VA especially.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Lucky\u2606Star a lot and I can understand where all the love and hate for it comes from, but I'm moeblob loving trash and I'm biased towards KyoAni because they made one of my favorite series of all time so your mileage may vary.",

            "content": "Lucky Star is a Comedy Slice of Life anime which follows a small group of 17 years old school-girls in their last year of high-school. The show consists of 24 episodes and has no ongoing story-line. Episodes are mostly divided into 3 parts, which are vaguely connected.\r\nStory: The plot mainly portraits the daily adventures of the 4 protagonists in a comedic, lighthearted way. We follow them threw their last year of high-school, where they encounter 'typical' teenage girls problems, like which side of a chocolate cornet bread is the top and which the bottom :D\r\nHere and there the show throws in some drama elements bypicking up topics like first love, frienship or growing up but always resolves them in a absurd or funny way, so the mood never becomes too serious. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Lucky Star has a GREAT cast consisting of the 4 main characters (Konata, Tsukasa, Kagams and Miyuki) and several side characters.\\n\r\nKonata Izumi: Konata is a hardcore otaku gamer girl who hates to do schoolwork and much rather likes to spend the whole night infront of her computer, playing mmorpgs or reading Mangas, although when it comes to finishing her schoolwork or learning for a test, she is great at pulling allnighters and she almost always gets acceptable results in school.\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa Hiiragi: Tsukasa never fails to entertain the audience with her lighthearted and naive nature. She is very clumsy and often apears to be more like a child than a highschooler, her biggest weakness though is mostlikely school. She is bad at basicly any subject. Her biggest strengths are housework and cooking and it is her biggest dream to be a good wife and mother some day.\\n\\n\r\nKagami Hiiragi: Kagami is Tsukasas Twin sister. In contrast to her sister, Kagami is very good at school and sport and has a very competetive mindset. Despite being so different, the two twin sisters get along very well and rely on each other alot of the times.\\n\\n\r\nMiyuki Takara: Miyuki is the smartest girl in the class. She has by far the least screentime since she often goes home instantly after school to study, when Konata and the others still hang out together and have fun.\\n\\n\r\nAnimations: The character design is superb, the characters are perfectly cute eye-candy! The artstyle is very minimalistic and oftentimes the backgrounds have very little to no details. I guess most people won't like this kind of minimalistic style, but for me it wasnt much of a problem at all.\\n\r\nLuckily the animations are very fluent, so no negative point there. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: The Luckystar opening must be one of the coolest in anime-history. It is in almost all my lists on my Ipod and it never gets boring. The melody is catchy and if your not carefull your gonna be humming the melody all day long befor you even notice :P \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: I would DEFINATLY not recommend this show for everyone!! If you are looking for a thrilling story and Shaya-Malan-style twists, your gona get REALY bored and frustraded with this show realy fast. To test if you like Lucky Star, just watch the opening scene, because it basicly sets the ton for  the rest of the show.  I pesonally love this show. After having seen over 200 different Anime from all genres, it still is on top of my list!!!  The reason for this is simple: Lucky Star is the only show i have seen (so far) where i have NOTHING to criticise. NOT the great story or animations or smart plottwists makes this my favorit Anime , but the absence of flaws. I personaly enjoyed EVERY second of this masterpiece and i wouldnt wanna miss this experience...so GO watch it!!!!",

            "content": "Now this is one for all you Slice of life fans and also those of you who liked Azumanga Daioh. In my opinion Lucky Star is the ultimate Slice of Life anime and if you're only into dub this show might be a problem seen as they have failed to release the last 4 episodes in dub (not a clue why, if you know message me I\u2019d be interested to find out).\r\nStory - Wait there\u2019s a story line to this? afraid not, but that\u2019s what makes this show so funny, heck the first episode they spend most of it talking about how they eat certainfoods and trust me, as dull as that sounds you will LOVE it. Each episode has nothing to do with the last and nothing to do with the next, it\u2019s just one random thing after another. Even the previews of the next episode have nothing to do with the show itself.\\n\\n\r\nArt - This is probably the worst thing about lucky star and they've done it so bad its good, now the main characters are all really well drawn, better than most shows I might add, but if you\u2019re just a background character who plays no real part than that means you\u2019re a blue human shaped blob nothing more...\\n\\n\r\nSound - there are so many sound effects in this show and they're all well timed and placed so no problem there in the least, and the reason this is a 9 and not an 8 is because at the end of every episode there is always a new end tune...usually taken from another anime with the cast singing it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - well this section is going to basically be dedicated to Konata Izumi for her amazing ability to be an anime character who's OTAKU!! Yes you heard me right she's otaku loves anime, manga, computer games all that stuff\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall -  In every episode wether it Konata, someone else or just a few items in the background there are constant references to other animes so if you've seen more than your fair share of animes than watch Lucky star and try to spot where your favourite animes are talked about/shown. This is another must see, and it has my golden seal of approval!!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n{{Please feel free to message me to tell me how I can/could improve my reviews to make them more helpful.}}\\n",

They each displayed all the sterotypes. Moe, Cute girl, gamer, hard worker ect. Gotta love it. I really enjoyed this anime, and I would give it an overall of 10. So go watch it now!!!",

Compared to other anime it should not be well reguarded as a work of epic plot nor captivating art and music quality; however it is still comfortable to sit down and watch. Comedy is definately the hardest to write of all the literary genres and this anime does make you chuckle from time to time. It is comparable to American cartoons in that it takes our unfortunately ordinary lives and tries toadd humor and wit by satirizing common pop culture and everyday things we complicate. It also takes advantage of many different regularly used character stereotypes and one character does not stand out too much further than the rest. It's simplistic and great for those who like shoujo, slice of life, or comedy; and for sitting down and being amused for half an hour without having much to expect nor bewilderment for your mind.",

But, even with a very simple plot, it is actually VERY great! :D\r\nArt: The art style is very unique, and I simply LOVE it! Very nice.\r\nSound: The music is very nice. The ending themes have much more then usual animes work put into it because each ending has a different song.\r\nCharacters: I loved the characters! An otaku, a tsundere, anairhead, and a smart airhead. PERFECT. X3\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I loved this anime, and I very much reccomend it! :D",

            "content": "This is going to be hard. Lucky Stay is one of those comical shows that can go in every direction. Sometimes it\u2019s a sit down and talk show and sometimes it\u2019s an otaku love show. Let\u2019s see, if you like random shit in your moe pie then you would really like this.\r\nNow that I have said this, I do have to say that I am one of those people\u2026 I actually like this show a lot. It doesn\u2019t try to be something its not, so many shows try to be something else. This show, well\u2026 it just is. Here is an example, the very firstshow, they spend 7 minutes talking about different food and how they like to eat it. They don\u2019t even explain the main characters, they just thrust you in. The characters are mostly 2 dimensional, though sometimes they do show little 3D characteristics. \\n\\n\r\nI think the best way to explain why there is no story if I talk about the characters and the manga. First off, the manga is actually all about a 4 panel joke base much like our own comics in the newspaper. Because of this, they have a limited time to get a point across. Even then, most of the Japanese jokes may go straight over people\u2019s heads if they don\u2019t know any of the otaku life. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the characters\u2026 Konata Izumi is the bona-fide otaku. She loves anything anime and even plays a couple dating sims along side her father. She may be good at sports but she would rather watch anime then be in a club. Kagami Hiirragi is a rather interesting character, acting rather tomboyish and crude but in the end, has a sweet side to her especially for her twin sister. Tsukasa Hiiragi is the younger twin that is rather clumsy and ditsy. The last one I will talk about is Miyuki Takara who is pretty much a moe girl with big breasts and cute glasses. She is clumsy but rather smart.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the other characters come on, it just seemed like they rushed to add more characters. You see some more then others like Kanata\u2019s little cousin. The others just seem to be pushed off to the side, and don\u2019t get much screen time. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is very childish and bright. Although it\u2019s like that, it\u2019s very clean with characters going into chibi faces and sometimes they miss shape the face but its normal for comic shows. For something done by Kyoto Animation, the creators of Air and Clannad, this is way lacking but yet, I feel if it was anything like those shows that it would probably be off a bit. The endings both seem a little out of place, the live action a lot more then the other. \\n\\n\r\nThe voices are pretty fun, the English and Japanese actually sound very similar and that can be good and bad. Some characters sound really high pitched and really harsh on the ears. I like how the characters are mostly voiced by seasoned veterians which adds to the Otaku fandom even more as if you watch anime at all in the English dub, you have at least heard one of the many star voice actors here. The only voice I didn\u2019t like was Patty\u2019s. She just sounds like she\u2019s forcing her voice. All in all, this is much like Azumanga Daioh. \\n",

Its slow,boring and it lacks character in most respects.\r\nOne of the things people always say is the pop culture references in this show are great. I watched a fair bit and found that they weren't good references. They just were like flop one liners that only amateur comedians might enjoy. I remember there was like 6 minute bit about how they eat a chocolate pastry from top or bottom, itliterally had no punch line it was like a low energy disagreement that just ended eventually.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no story to lucky star, its just people talking for a lot of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Animation is just alright, nothing is wrong with it in any real respect. I mean the characters are meant to look simple and kinda be cute and the sound i just sound. The opening theme is surprisingly cute but its high energy leads you into a really boring let down of a episode.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy lucky star, it felt like it was trying to mimic a sitcom but it just felt flat. I didn't laugh at any jokes and nothing happened that was in anyway interesting. The characters are boring and 1 dimensional. This shows just bad for a general audience. If you wanna know for sure watch 1 half a episode cause that's all it takes to know if you get the inside joke that is lucky star.",

Some of their background animation wasn't the best.\r\nSound was a 3. It seemed like they played the same OST over and over again and it was kinda annoying. And they done that for the whole 24 episodes. But a 3 is the best I can give it because I cannotlie about this because it is my opinion. \\n\r\nThe characters were a 8. I liked most of them. I liked Konata the most because she reminds me of me. We both go on the computer til 3 o clock. And watch anime and read manga. \\n\r\nThe enjoyment for me was a 7. The random episodes wasn't my thing but they did do a lot of funny things. But I got bored at some parts because they go off talking about strange things. \\n\r\nOVERALL it was an 8. The opening was okay I guess. So were the characters and the art. \\n\r\nDefinetly check this out if you like clean comedy or strange conversations but every anime fan should have saw this anime. \\n\r\nAdd me as a friend and we can dicuss our things in common about this. \\n\r\nNEXT REVIEW: Lucky Star OVA!",

            "content": "To those looking to view Lucky Star solely for its commedy: don't. \r\nLucky Star is pretty much 480 minutes of \"Ayy, same lol\". The series simultaneously makes fun of but undeniably loves the inspiration for its material, Japanese otaku culture. Anyone who's watched a decent amount of anime will often relate to the main character, Konata, and the other main characters, particularly Kagami, will remind you of any conversations you might have had with a friend who doesn't have the same interests you have. This relatability is the series' strong point. \r\nPacing is certainly very, very slow, given the absence of a plot. I'm nottoo familiar with the whole source material behind the anime, but I believe it's structured as a four-panel strip. Similarly, Lucky Star's structure primarily depends on a series of chronological skits. The overarching plot is simply there to provide a general backbone for the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is absolutely gorgeous. CG was almost nonexistent as far as I could tell. Backgrounds had a hand-drawn aesthetic, and I felt that there was a lot of love put into the art for Lucky Star. Although background characters often just end up as blurry gray silhouettes, I loved the refusal to compromise and utilize more CG. I've noticed that there's a lot of criticism surrounding the \"lolicon\" character design to pander to otakus, and while that's somewhat true, the overall consistent aesthetic and the almost chibi-like proportions made the anime feel like it had its own unique art style rather than pandering with heavy amounts of moe (i.e. Gakkou Gurashi). Character designs were very cute and did not ring my bullshit alarm like other shows.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding characters, characters were admittedly one-dimensional. I felt like stereotypes were heavily used (Konata the otaku, Patty the foreign otaku, lecherous father, clumsy moe Miyuki, etc.) but given the nature of the anime and the good execution of each character, I felt that each character was extremely likable. Nearing the end of the anime, I truly felt regret that it was coming to an end; there's also some surprisingly tender moments assuming that you're at least somewhat invested in the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I did end up taking four months to finally finish the damn anime, it was genuinely enjoyable while it lasted. The endings were all unique, and the sketches before each ending all added another layer of self-aware humor.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, Lucky Star is a SoL through and through. If you like slice of life, Lucky Star serves as an excellent SoL and comedy. If you can't stand the genre however, Lucky Star will likely have poor pacing and lack of humor for you. That being said, I can wholeheartedly recommend Lucky Star as a must-see for anyone who enjoys watching anime.",

Basically, it's really hard to even give this anime a four in the story department, as there really isn't a \"story\" here. And honestly, I'm really surprised of the outcome. There's a lot of random stuff that happens on this show. Mainly the main four just living their lives and doing what normal high school girls might do. But honestly what made it really fun to watch was the \"lucky channel\" segment at the end of the show, as well as the reallystrange ending with the guy singing (that really was funny, though). But honestly I have to say I'm impressed with what we're given with such a shallow basis.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, I had a very bad feeling about this one. I had the impression that these characters were going to be your typical, and uninspired bunch who have the same traits that we've all seen before. But there's a slight change with them. For me, it's the atmosphere that the characters give off. Most of them *are* your typical \"tsundere\" type or your \"shy-cute\" type, but they seem to have more than *just* that. There's also a healthy diversity of personas here, you'll see what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound are both pretty good for the age. The art can sometimes be very plain looking, but it doesn't bother me. As for the OP, I can see why it's so infamous; it's damn good. \\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot of stuff to be seen. Lots of really random stuff, but it's all very fun and honestly never really gets boring. Has a killer OP, really great roster of characters, and overall just a good atmosphere. I recommend you watch this if you're looking for a chilled out anime with *no* real story but just looking for a fun time.",

            "content": "Lucky Star is truly a slice of life anime. First of all, I noticed most of my friends who didn't like Lucky Star, didn't like because of it's slow pace, and that's completely fine. I understand some people like some kind of humor and everything, so I'll start by the humor.\r\nThe humor in this show is different from what we usually see, it's more based on that \"Haha, I know that feeling\" type of jokes, and situations that involves already knowing the characters, because if you don't know their personality, about 70% of the jokes won't work.\r\nKnow those jokes on a stand-up comedy show? It'skinda like that.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the characters, as I mentioned, each has their unique traits of personality and are as relatable as adorable, but that doesn't mean you never saw characters like them in any anime ever, or that you'll necessarily like all of them. But still, they're very well done, and honestly, Konata is one of the best anime characters I've ever seen. In general, they all develop a really good relationship with who's watching.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I'd like to point out is that most of my friends dropped this show on episode 1 (actually, most didn't even FINISHED episode 1), I understand why but please, stay and watch at least 3 or 5 episodes, because seriously, it might take some time to you to get used to this show. It happened to me, I was kinda bored on episode 1, but at the end I laughed, and some days later (I kinda forgot about this show actually) I got back and watched episode 2 to episode 5, and I started laughing more frequently and getting used to the humor, and remember I mentioned that the character's personalities are important in this show? Yeah, it takes some time to you to \"know\" them better, that's part of why you need to watch more than one or two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWell, on the technical part I'm not very specialist, except by the sound, and man, it's wonderful. Voice acting is great and BGM is really great.\\n\r\nAbout the art, I don't know much about this to judge, but I love it, character design is wonderful and expression faces are standout.\\n\\n\r\nOn story, there's very little, but there's some traits (as Konata and her family, for example) that I love, but mostly, it's normal stories, you won't see other worldly events or plot twists, this show is more like meeting friends and interacting with them. You know that random conversation that friends have sometimes? Yeah, that kind of thing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd about enjoyment, I agree that sometimes it can get a bit too slow, so I don't recommend you give it a first or second chance when you're sleepy.",

            "content": "TL;DR version: Lucky\u2606Star is the anime equivalent of a white noise machine.\r\nLong version:\r\nI've put off Lucky Star for a very long time.\r\nHonestly speaking, my younger teenage self in the late 2000's would have bashed the crap out of this series and probably rate it a 2 or something, but we're not asking what younger me thinks. Younger me is a dumbass after all.\r\nPresent me in his mid to late 20's somewhat enjoyed LS.\r\nThe thing about Lucky Star is that it's not supposed to be over-the-top entertaining (in the main show anyways, as opposed to Lucky Channel, but we'll get to that later). Lucky Star isvery mellow in atmosphere, even the background music is consistent, simple and kept at the minimum to maintain that mellow feeling. There are no major conflicts or fantastical point in a plot. Only about 2 episodes out of 24 does it show a serious tone. It's not necessarily something you binge watch (although I did, but whatever). The layout of each episode can vary, but once again, for approximately three quarters of the show, it's very tranquil and relaxing in nature. So if you're more about adrenaline fueled excitement and burst out laughing, or full on cry or rage, this show isn't for you.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters aren't as expressive and entertaining as you might think, contrary to how the opening song has portrayed them. A lot of their conversations revolve around mundane activities, situations and objects. In a way, it makes you, the audience, feel like you are the third wheel amongst a group of friends. You listen to their complaints or thoughts, but don't really input your own, making some episodes extremely hard and boring to watch (most notably, episode 1 and their \"food talk\"). At least, that's the way it is for me.\\n\r\nThe characters barely have much personality. Besides Izumi and a few others, all of the characters are really bland. I was disappointed that new side characters gets introduced RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE of the series. Sadly, they're a bit more interesting than the main girls we are used to seeing (with the exception of Izumi of course). Izumi unfortunately has the responsibility of pulling the main show together with her geeky personality, but when you have the slightly more interesting of the bland bunch trying to make the show entertaining, you're gonna have a bad time. I like Izumi, but even she isn't that amazing as a character.\\n\\n\r\nIts humor heavily uses references, some of it VERY obscure unless you're well-versed in said reference. The core of their humor is how the topic relates to the audience. LS is too reliant on the audience's understanding of the characters' plight, which doesn't make good entertainment and causes the delivery to be quite weak, although a few did catch me by surprise and I actually laughed. A joke won't unfold itself without a good delivery. However, giving credit where it's due, it's actually quite original in a sense as well. I did enjoy the few running gags that they've installed, like how the nameless side characters all have the same distinctive voice of a middle aged man or an old woman, no matter their actual age. I've also enjoyed how they handle the ending songs and the use of live action. Half of the time they're hits or misses. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, Lucky Channel. The Lucky Channel segments have their ups and downs. It's the complete opposite in atmosphere and the characters are, in my opinion, overly expressive and the transition from Lucky Star to Lucky Channel just ruins the flow of the show. First Lucky Star puts me in a relaxed state, then immediately slaps me with the ostentatious Akira of Lucky Channel is just a terrible transition between scenes. If Lucky Channel was somehow made into a separate side story, then I would be fine with. The only thing I like about Lucky Channel was the interaction between the anchors and their development, but even that can only be tolerated for a certain amount of episodes before you grow tired of it.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Lucky\u2606Star is pretty average. It's a 6 at best and a 3 at worst.",

            "content": "I honestly did not know what I was expecting when I first watched this anime. When I started watching the first episode, I found myself listening to a conversation on which has no effect on my life whatsoever, and somehow ended up liking it.\r\nI don't know what makes this anime so prime, if it's because of the comedic-randomness that comes and go every now and then, then this may be one of the gems you could find in the pitch-black coal patch. If you have nothing to do anymore, or just completed watching a sad/scary anime and need some cooldown time, then this is theanime for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe story line that this anime has is much more of random occurrences than of a a solid story type, since it is a comedic anime, of course. Nonetheless, the director has done a decent job in keeping the momentum on check and at the same time making it amusing, because one of the biggest problems of comedy type animes is that eventually, the joke tires out itself. But with random nonsensical situations and horseplay, the anime never seems to lose the momentum, and still is hilarious the second time around.\\n\\n\r\nThe artistic value of the anime is nothing much to report to, other from the fact that it does a great job in emphasizing the cuteness of the characters somehow.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters on this anime is what gives this anime its publicity. Konata, Kagami and Tsukasa form the trio of folks that never seem to disappoint in giving you a laugh-dosage whenever they pull off a gag or from simply forgetting to do their homeworks.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the series, I ended up enjoying it, and eventually gave it an almost perfect score because I enjoyed it to such an extent. I would recommend this to anybody who is itching for a laugh or basically has nothing to do.\\n",

            "content": "Going into Lucky\u2606Star (yeah,  I added the star) I didn't know what to expect. You know, as soon as the episode started my blood was pumping; I was hyped up! I was getting ready to enjoy the ride of a life time: an adventure through Lucky\u2606Star. After being hit with a fairly upbeat opening theme, I was already at the edge of my seat. Then the actual show came. I sat there, my mouth opened, my eyes opened wide. A moment later, my voice finally mustered enough energy to let out words which echoed a crossed the  heavens:\r\n\"Yo. They just talked about howto eat a flippin' pastry. Flap this shizzle. I'm dropping this.\"\\n\\n\r\nI pulled up myanimelist (I'm a noob around here, I know) without hesitation, went to Lucky\u2606Star, jotted down my first episode watched, and pulled up another episode.\\n\\n\r\nWait, I did what? Well, shoot. Before I knew it, Lucky\u2606Star was set as Completed. Why you ask? Because I quite enjoyed it, duh. I admit, the show is a bit overrated but there were some redeeming foshizzle points that gave me an excuse NOT to drop this, one of which being the story.\\n\\n\r\nOk, I lied. There is no story. But here's the thing, having no plot was actually a plus to this whole \"cute girls doing cute things\" formula. You know, I'm occasionally stressed out because of school and this show helped me settle down and cool off because there doesn't seem to be any conflict or problems or evil voodoo stuff going on here. None of that \"Ack. Nooo. She's going to die. Now I'm bummed out.\" No no no. In here, only good seems to come out of this world. Lucky\u2606Star isn't one of those shows where you can talk about hours on end with friends (unless.. you actually do that then uh.. ok), but rather a show you just pick up whenever and finish whenever. No cliffhangers, no drama, no problem. Instead of a story, we were given stories (damn right, PLURAL).\\n\\n\r\nBut how can a plotless show provide a story? That doesn't make any sense. Well, I can argue that the characters themselves make up the story as we move, each second, towards the end of an episode. So instead of giving us a set script to follow, we are given the luxury of an open script. The characters are mere catalysts who, when put together, create a nice gateway to a slice of life. The characters basically form a team (not literally) and they work as a team to accomplish a common goal. But often times there are some teammates who just causes a disruption in the work flow of the team. Enter a plethora of supporting female characters roughly around the second half of the series. At some point, it seemed like we were getting some character development out of these newly introduced characters. I just felt it was unnecessary since the development felt rushed. And since they were introduced so far in the series thus giving them a smaller window of screen time than the four main characters, I really didn't care for them even after their \"character development.\"\\n\\n\r\nDespite have a seemingly large cast of characters, the voice acting (with the exception of Patricia Martin; sorry Nozomi) were pretty fitting for each of the characters. The soundtrack seemed fitting in every scene, despite the track sounding a bit boring. The art wasn't bad either, even IF the art style is a bit simplistic. For a show like this, the simplistic art style was fitting.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, some episodes were just plain boring. Some episodes were interesting. Regardless, I quite enjoyed the Lucky\u2606Star. There were a lot of references that I've caught and it was fun to see this show take a comedic spin on them.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end of the day, Lucky\u2606Star really isn't for everyone. If you already hate moeblobs then you certainly won't magically wake up one day looking forward to watching this. You aren't going to be laughing your Ash off, but rather crack a smile here and there. And this is definitely a show you'd watch with a couple of thug buddies.\\n\\n\r\n\"Yo man what we watchin'?\"\\n\r\n\"Damn. ****'s about to get real up in here. We watchin' Lucky Star\"\\n\\n\r\nYou should have an open mind when going into this show and really have no high expectations if you truly want to enjoy the show more or less. Lucky\u2606Star is not a master piece. It's not garbage. It is, however, a decent watch which will only appeal to certain groups of people.",

            "content": "3rd time to write a review. Please tell me if there is something wrong with my review it will be a great help.\r\n\"aimai san-SENCHI\" is the original romanji.\r\n But for most people in the internet its\r\n\"I eat sausage\" .....really internet\r\nBefore I start let me tell you guys a story. When I was in high school about during my 2nd year, I manage stumble across this anime and as you all may know the opening was catchy and caught my attention. I started singing \"Motteke! Se-ra-fuku \" all of the sudden in the class with my friends. Then all of my otaku friends went silent andone of them told me \"YOU DO REALIZE THAT SONG IS ABOUT WANTING TO WEAR A SAILOR UNIFORM AND A CUTER SKIRT....\". I stop singing and the whole group went silent so we just concluded that we never heard anyone singing and basically that never happened. So that is one of my regrets in life and now I'm closing it as part of my history that never happened!!!\\n\\n\r\nLucky Star is best described by the famous \"Seinfeld\" show quote \" A show about nothing\". Now before you dismiss this as another generic slice of life, which technically your right but in my defense its done good.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n\"Everybody's doing something, we'll do nothing.\" which is also a quote from Seinfeld that I'm pretty sure the creator of Lucky Star was thinking at that time he was making Lucky Star. This anime is plot-less or more appropriately there is no story because  all the plot is in Miyuki, Right guys, No, okay I'll stop. Personally I always have high hopes for slice of life genre type of anime because I want to see them pull off the million dollar challenge and that is \"To make normal everyday life events, interesting\". So normally I have high hopes for this anime but it gives us the mundane yet fun events of life. Sure it is funny and comedic but i want something more interesting. I think of Lucky Star as a lower type of sitcom because it does feel like a sitcom but sitcoms have series of events that connects or has a relation to another event in one episode which is very interesting while Lucky Star is just a random collection of everyday life of different high school girls.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWell one word to describe the art, MOE!!!! I am losing my manliness as I was watching this anime specially whenever Tsukasa is making a Moe scene so I have to punch a wall to regain my manliness. Besides the art of the characters, the background and others are rather simplistic.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIt only have a random songs at the end but, Oh my God, the opening. The opening is titled \"Motteke! Se-ra-fuku\" and even if it is translated to English I still cannot completely understand the song. All I know about the opening is that it is catchy and one of my friend said it is about sailor uniforms and skirts.... Of all the catchy songs this one has tormented me because I sang this in front of my friends and its meaning is wanting to wear a sailor uniform and skirts. However it is still great because every time I hear Lucky Star that song is the first thing to play in my mind then suddenly I am singing it. WARNING THE OPENING WILL HAUNT YOU FOR YEARS\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThough the show doesn't have a plot it still have some interesting characters From the first 4 character batch to the 2nd 4 character batch. I'll start with the 2nd batch:\\n\\n\r\nYutaka Kobayakawa- Our typical weak yet cheerful character. Her role is to be the innocent one and sometimes be in a running gag in the 2nd half where she is in a relationship with Minami, one of her classmates. Though I think of her as a 2nd Tsukasa because she sometimes play the Moe role but of course Tsukasa take the top, sorry Yu-chan.\\n\\n\r\nMinami Iwasaki- Our silent yet lovable character. I can't say much about her besides the her overused running gag of \"flat-chest\" which is a hit and miss because I'm guy, I can't understand that much.\\n\\n\r\nHiyori Tamura- Our stereotypical otaku girl who likes yaoi to yuri. She delivers some gags from here and there which is cool to me.\\n\\n\r\nPatricia Martin- Our stereotypical stereotype foreigner because she could not be more stereotype about Japanese. She basically learned Japanese from anime and manga which I'm pretty sure that the author thought about us otakus outside from Japan. \\n\\n\r\nThen we have our 1st cast or our original favorite:\\n\\n\r\nMiyuki Takara- Our favorite air-headed megane. i love her comedic scenes with her mother and the running gag in the dentist. Her running gags are comedy gold.\\n\\n\r\nKonata Izumi- Our favorite and one of the best otaku girl we wish to exist. I love every scene with her which makes the scenes funnier.\\n\\n\r\nKagami Hiiragi- Our favorite tsundere character. I love her running gag about love and her tsundere tendency with Konata. Which bring one of my question \" why are tsundere to Konata?\"\\n\\n\r\nTsukasa Hiiragi- Our favorite clutz and moe girl. basically her role is the mascot girl. Sure she is not the best girl and the most comedic because Konata takes that spot but she is the cutest. She is my favorite girl and one of my WAIFU SO HANDS OFF. \\n\\n\r\nthe others are just normal folks in everyday life.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show is easily forgettable even though it is very comedic, art of the characters are MOE-tastic, and the opening is catchy. It is a show about nothing so don't expect that much but just pure laughs. It is just everyday life of normal high school girls that sometimes we do and we find it funny. Also later on the series where they show new characters, which are the new 4 rehash characters, is unnecessary because we already love the old ones and they don't feel new at all. Nonetheless, just as I said it is like a sitcom only poorly made but still could deliver fantastic humor. If only they make one story per episode then those 24 episode won't look like a random series of events.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nPositive\\n\r\n-The Comedic moments will make you laugh hard.\\n\r\n-The art of the characters are cute!!!\\n\r\n-Catchy theme song that will be stuck in your head.\\n\r\n- The original 4 characters are good comedic ensemble\\n\\n\r\nNegative\\n\r\n-It has no story or has no plot.\\n\r\n-The events happened in a episode feels like a random series of normal events of just normal people.\\n\r\n-They had a lot of awkward jokes in the later episodes.\\n\r\n-The new group that they try to introduce to us are typical to most slice of life anime and they are not as much as interesting as the 1st.\\n\r\n-Easily forgettable\\n\\n\r\nLucky Star is funny and also kinda overrated because it is easily forgettable but surely have fun and a good laugh afterwards.",

            "content": "I'm one of the few who actually enjoyed this show. And I can understand why so many of you really dislike Lucky Star. It's simple-minded, a bit pointless, and has no heavy duty plot. But sometimes that's all you need. I don't typically watch these types of plot-less shows but sometimes I need a break from those epic, mind-blowing, fast paced dramas. Lucky Star has a way of providing just what I need when wanting to watch something simple, but also leaves me laughing out loud at all the little things. \r\nI believe that Lucky Star is actually a great representation of every day lifeof bored teenagers. The characters talk about things that shouldn't matter, always procrastinate, and get jealous of their friend's lovely curves. There are also a lot of references to other animes, and chances are, that if you don't watch a lot of anime, you will not get these references. Another reason I absolutely love this show is because it's kind of a parody of itself as well. If you watch the endings of each episode, when \"Lucky Channel\" comes on, you may or may not notice the little side remarks about what the characters do or say. I love this show and I think it's suited for anybody.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think there is anything wrong with this anime, in fact, in may be one of my favorites. The fact that it is so simple makes me laugh a lot more. It's a show that you will be able to turn on, skip 3 episodes, and not need an explanation of what happened. The characters are also all hilarious in their own way and are very similar to a lot of people in real life. The scenarios are accurate to life, and things that every teenager goes through. I enjoy the fact that there are only four main characters, as opposed to several main characters. I'm not trying to beat up on animes that are sophisticated and have a lot of plots and characters, in fact, those are some of the best animes! I'm just saying that sometimes it's really nice to have a mellow show that is tailored for anyone and everyone. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10",

            "content": "*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*\r\nSome say it's a masterpiece, others describe it as gloriously bland. All I can say is that I had a lot of fun with this one.\r\nLucky Star. Where do we start? Story?\r\nHaha, that was just a joke. Lucky Star hardly has a plot. It's just a showcase of a couple of girls' high-school lives.\r\nWhile I suppose it can be linked to western sitcom as it focuses more on a general subject than any particular story arc, there's hardly even a clear goal that the characters try to achieve in most episodes.\r\nYet that factor ends up making this anime truly special.\r\nThis is a veryhonest and relatable show. It will make you laugh, on the very rare occasion it may even make you a little emotional.\\n\r\nBut there is no action, no drama and no romance.\\n\r\nEven the comedy isn't that in-your-face most of the time.\\n\r\nLucky Star's appeal comes from its appreciation of the mundane.\\n\r\nThe joy often comes from feeling what the characters feel, it's sort of like an anime caricature of real life. \u2026With added parody elements thrown in to spice it up.\\n\r\nWhen all is said and done though, it just works.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fairly fluid and has a distinctive, borderline chibi art-style. It's nothing to be amazed by, but it does its job very well - Especially if cuteness is your thing.\\n\r\nSame applies to the OST and sound. Music isn't used very commonly, but when it is used it works within the context it's applied to. The theme song also gets bonus points for being stupidly catchy, even if its lyrics make no sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the driving force within the story. They will be the ones you will relate to, sympathise with and laugh at. And they do a pretty good job.\\n\r\nWhile some are more interesting than others, you will end up liking a fair amount. \\n\r\nThey also pulled an awesome twist on the main character by making her an anime nerd.\\n\r\nSo instead of making the main character a blank slate for the audience to fit themselves into, the main character IS the audience (or at least the most likely audience). \\n\r\nEven typical character archetypes like the tsundere or wolf in sheep's clothing are played exceptionally well. They fit in perfectly to the show's context, despite their simplicity.\\n\\n\r\nIt's safe to say I very much enjoyed Lucky Star, but I do have a few things to mention before you jump right into watching this.\\n\r\nNot everybody will like it. The pacing is slow. Very slow. If you're expecting loads of stuff to happen then you're watching the wrong show. The pacing instead adds to the effect.\\n\r\nI suggest watching this as a means to relax rather than pure entertainment, it's great to watch after having anything too intense in your day. It's like a stress-killer.\\n\r\nThis also may not be the best show for complete newcomers due to sheer number of references and parody jokes made in it. Once you've watched just enough anime to get a general idea of the typical genres and clich\u00e9s, then it'll probably make enough sense though.\\n\r\nAlso I've only watched the sub so if the dub is bad, don't sue me. >w",

            "content": "Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that Lucky Star is one of the pioneering anime of the 'four-moe-girls-doing-silly-chats' genre, a word that I've just invented myself. I've never seen an anime before Lucky Star's times that had the same style of humor and approach, but instead I noticed a lot of shows that seem to model after Lucky Star, such as K-ON, A Channel and Yuru Yuri.\r\nSTORY:\r\nAnyway, if slice-of-life and random chatting isn't your cup of tea for an anime, then forget about Lucky Star. This anime doesn't have a main storyline at all, it just focuses on the lives of fourhigh school girls and the jokes they crack with each other. Ah, and if four isn't enough, you will meet with another four halfway through the series.\\n\\n\r\nYour next question must be, \"then what are the types of jokes that the girls crack?\" Many, actually. I find puns the most frequent to show up, followed by random references to other anime series, especially The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (which, appropriately, is another series directed by KyoAni, Lucky Star's studio). Besides that, there are also jokes that revolves around the Japanese culture, such as the food one in Episode 1.\\n\\n\r\nThose who are not familiar with watching anime or the Japanese language/culture might have a hard time understanding most of the jokes in Lucky Star. Despite this, I would still recommend them to watch it. I was also like them when I first watched Lucky Star, and it was after watching the series many times that I can finally laugh heartily at the jokes.\\n\\n\r\nFrom my narration above, you can probably guess two things. First of all, Lucky Star's jokes are truly funny when you are able to understand it. Secondly, even though you may not understand the jokes, you still would probably want to watch it again and again. Just for the slice-of-life moments that is depicted in the show. They are so simple, yet so wonderfully crafted. I still could not help but sometimes laugh at the thought of the many jokes played on Kagami (one of the main characters).\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nAbsolutely loved it. Like the story, the art also took for a more simplistic style, but you never get bored of watching it. It blends with the slice-of-lifeness of the show well. The characters have great design too.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nIt's your normal comedy fare. Plain, unexciting tunes for the soundtrack that fit suitably into the \"ordinary\" nature of the show. The OP, \"Mottoke Sailor Fuku\" was great at the first impression, but gets a bit boring after a while. The EDs that change with every episode wasn't too memorable for me either.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Lucky Star's voice acting part was spectacular. Konata's seiyuu, Aya Hirano had a great vocal range as always, injecting life into every little segment of the character. Emiri Katou also had a wonderful voice that could not have been any more suitable for a tsundere role like Hiiragi Kagami.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nBecause it's a slice-of-life show that focuses more on developing the characters than the plot, you could naturally imagine how I felt about the characters of Lucky Star. I think it's quite self-explanatory already, so I'll skip this part for now.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nYep, it's an anime that definitely deserves the praise it had received. It's also another great masterpiece in my collection that I would recommend it to my friends. By the way, I heard that KyoAni has done another similar anime called Nichijou this year, but I hasn't really seen it yet.",

All you hear are every day conversations between some high school girls and the weird thing is, it's hilarious. I even found myself having some of those discussions with my friends. It was fun to tell them the facts Ilearned by watching this. X)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation fits the content perfectly. You shouldn't watch this expecting idealized high school girls.

Other people call it boring, and I can definitely see why; then again, slice-of-life isn't for everyone. Back then I always enjoyed Lucky Star's constant references to anime and otaku tendencies because it was something that I could relate to and snicker at. I remember that I would play Lucky Star while folding the laundry or cleaning my room, kinda like how someone plays a podcast while doing busy work.\r\n...However, that was a fewyears ago, and today I decided to finally finish up the rest of Lucky Star. One thing, I guess it looked better when I was younger. In my opinion, I think Lucky Star would have fared better as a 14 or 20 episode series because by the 17th episode, I was getting bored with the tiny bits of situational humor. I loved it when the story threw in a few personal bits of the characters' lives and feelings (I won't cite any because spoilers), and really, I wish that there was more of that towards the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIt's still a series that I would turn to when I need something to listen to while I do chores, but it isn't something that I would sit down for a watch. If you like cute girls constantly talking about nothing but daily life humor, then this is a good anime for you. I just wished this show could have taken a more personal approach like they did in a few bits of a few episodes.",

            "content": "Lucky Star is one of those anime that is hard to talk about. In a way, the cutesy 'nya' faced Konata has almost become the face of anime as a whole nowadays so its no understatement to say that the show had a massive impact on the anime scene as a whole. But the show Di Gi Charat and the character Digiko had a similar role in the anime scene as well; it doesn't make either show genuinely good in any way. What makes shows like Di Gi Charat and Lucky Star reach these heights is not quality but rather the act of pandering. Injokes, if you will. From Project A-ko, to Di Gi Charat, to Lucky Star, this is an established tradition of anime--every generation of anime has that one show of in jokes about anime that immediately draws in the hits and legendary statuses because the viewer can go \"Ha, I got that reference!\". \\n\\n\r\nBut like I said. None of this makes Lucky Star good. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty much not there. That's to be expected, since its a slice-of-life comedy, and there's no actual goal to be reached. It's more meant to be a skit show. But when your story is meant to be skit comedy then it has to be actually funny, and sadly I can't really say that about this show. When your very first skit is about the right way to eat a pastry with no self-awareness of the stupidity of the question, then there's a problem. The 'plot' (which is the jokes) begins to plod forward and ten minutes can feel like an hour. These slice-of-life skits are mixed in between Konata making references to Kadokawa and Bandai productions, because she's an lol nerd gurl, you know. Pick your poison: the plodding slice of life skits where nothing happens because the girls are too dumb to figure out basic logic, or the anime skits that just make you wish you were watching the anime in question instead of this trite watered down equivalent of Hot Topic shirts with a Keep Calm and Fandom On joke on them. \\n\\n\r\nA bad show can still keep me interested with good characters, and boy does Lucky Star trip over its own feet on that. We have Le Smug Anime Girl, the Hothead Busybody, the Klutzy Moe, and the Princess (or Ojou if you will). And trust me, they ain't going ANYWHERE outside of that. Oh and they all love video games and like to sleep a lot. Aren't they so RELATEABLE, guys? The rest of the cast is just a bunch of similarly one note personality anime tropes, and I suppose that's supposed to be the joke, but its not really all that funny. But I'll give the show credit, it DOES have characters that actually made me turn my head. Meito Anizawa is always funny in his ridiculous overacting and overanimation, and Akira and Shiraishi(the latter voiced by and based on the voice actor of the same name) never fail to make me laugh in their 'Lucky Channel' ending segments. I'd honestly rather watch a Lucky Channel show as opposed to 'Forced Reference Moeskits: The Show'. I ended up finding myself waiting desperately for the show to end so they could just get to the actual funny skit that was Lucky Channel. \\n\\n\r\nBut I do have to give this show credit where credit is due. The animation is very good. It's fairly fluid, the designs are nice, and its got a bright and colorful look that fits the narrative of the show. It's not too saturated or desaturated in its coloring choices so it ends up looking nice, although we do have a fair share of pinks and purples. The voices, while ANNOYING, at least fit the characters. And I would be lying if Your New Favorite Earworm that is the Lucky Star opening isn't catchy. It is, and it caught on for a reason. The song is cute and fun but wacky and silly, and the dancing is of course addictive and fun. \\n\\n\r\nSadly that's pretty much the only good things I have to say about Lucky Star. It looks pretty nice, and the sound is fitting with one hell of an earworm opening. Outside of that? I can't positively recommend this show to anyone. Not in good faith. It's a patently bad show made to cash in on otakus and in-jokes. There's nothing to it but that, and while a show can be good with in-jokes, this one simply is not. If you want a show with good in-jokes, try FLCL or Project A-ko. In the end you'll probably get more from those than you'll ever get from Lucky Star.",

It requires some knowledge of anime/manga, and otaku culture to understand a lot of the jokes. But if you're a fan of anime I suggest you give it a watch. It can be quite funny. And don't let the cover fool you. I thought since the cast was all little girls (which they're not really little, they're supposed to be 17 to 18 years old) that it would be all cutesy moe stuff, but it's not (well mostly not). In fact thewhole moe thing is a source of a lot of jokes. One of the things I like about it is that it's pure comedy.  It's kind of like the \"Seinfeld\" of anime i.e. a show about nothing. It's just about funny everyday things, especially everyday otaku things. It's one of the few anime that I've found I can just sit down and laugh and nothing else. I would definitely suggest people give it a shot.",

            "content": "On top of just being one of the most fun slice-of-life comedy shows out there due to great comedy, memorable characters and a gorgeous presentation, what makes Lucky Star even more interesting is just how unique it is in the way it approaches everything - especially in its attitude, the way in which it chooses to flesh out its characters and how it showcases all of this in its presentation.\r\nIn regards to its attitude, structure and just how it feels, Lucky Star is simply like no other series out there. There's a general vibe of the show that's like it doesn't even know it's ananime or at least doesn't care to be anything like one (the meta Lucky Channel end segments and all of the ED's for episodes 13-24 being probably the biggest examples of this). Likewise, it doesn't even feel like any other comedy TV show, so much as it feels just like a day in the life of a bunch of Japanese high school girls in the year 2007, whose lives and friend interactions just happen to be rather comedic. This quality of the show is a result of its two most notable and controversial elements: one being that almost all of the runtime is dedicated to the characters just sitting around having small talk and discussing everyday things, and the other being that it contains an incredible amount of references to Japanese culture, otaku culture, anime, video games, etc. that were relevant at that time. This series is actually quite infamous and divisive for these reasons, with many expressing that they find it boring and/or that its reference humor is outdated and doesn't hold up anymore, but I have to at least partly disagree for a few reasons.\\n\\n\r\nFor one thing, despite most of the series just being characters talking about random everyday bullshit, I still do find it surprisingly entertaining - not only because I found the conversations to be pretty funny on their own, but also because of the characters that are having them and the way in which the conversations are presented (more on both of these things later). Secondly, most of the comedy in the show doesn't even come from reference humor, but rather from relatable situations and verbal abuse between friends. Lastly, although I'm sure most of them did fly over my head, the references in a way make this show like a time capsule for the mid-2000's, and as someone who loves history and especially history of pop culture, I really appreciate that. Also, its obvious references that the average viewer is more likely to get mostly still hold up really well today anyways. (Haruhi is still great, guys!)\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as hinted at earlier, arguably the biggest reason why this series succeeds as much as it does is its cast - the characters in Lucky Star are fantastic and they completely sell the show's tone and comedy. All of them are so good-natured and have such entertaining personalities, that watching them do anything is a fun time. They're all incredibly relatable and fleshed-out, and much of the personal connection I had with this show stems from this. One of the biggest things I took away from watching this series was how I see a bit of myself in all of the main characters (particularly Konata and Kagami). The fact that this show manages to flesh out its characters as much as it does entirely through 24 episodes of everyday meaningless conversation is nothing short of utterly remarkable. After all, conversations are just as much about the people having them as they are about their subject matter, and Lucky Star is the first show I've ever seen to apply this logic to such an extreme degree. As opposed to other series, these characters aren't defined by their actions, development or backstory but rather by how they eat chocolate cornets.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the presentation that I was heaping praise on earlier, this is where this series stands out even moreso than it did already. Lucky Star is without a doubt not only the most pleasant-looking slice-of-life show I\u2019ve ever seen but also one of the most aesthetically gorgeous shows of any genre I've ever seen, and this might just be its greatest strength. The art style, particularly in its character designs, steers away from the realistic look of later KyoAni shows like K-On! and goes completely over the top with being exuberantly bright, vibrant and girlishly colorful (purple, pink and blue dominate the color palette), and looks all the better for it. All of the cast\u2019s designs are adorable and gorgeous to look at, being simplistic enough to look like anyone could draw them while still somehow remaining incredibly distinct and memorable. Like in Clannad, another KyoAni show that came out later the same year, the backgrounds are usually soft and made to contrast well with the characters\u2019 more vibrant designs. Besides the art style, KyoAni also did an amazing job in making sure that a show which is mostly just filled with characters sitting around talking, still features some amazing animation and directing that help make all of its scenes visually engaging on some level. All of these elements of its presentation come together to give the show a soothing atmosphere and combined with the nonstop mostly inconsequential, fun dialogue, make this show incredibly enjoyable, pleasant and comfy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I\u2019ve touched on the good-natured characters and carefree tone of Lucky Star, that leads me into my next point, which is the lack of any real substantial drama or melodrama in the series. Depending on who you are and what you're looking for with this show, that will either be a disappointment or a blessing. I know I like comedies to have some emotional weight and heart to them, and can't really say this show maybe wouldn't have been even better with those elements in it, but we'll never know. Not to say there isn't some very rare moments of heartstring-pulling, but 99% of the show is played for laughs. I'm a bit torn on this myself but I guess, if nothing else, I have to at least respect the consistency in what this series was going for.\\n\\n\r\nAnd on a final note, this series ended perfectly. Upon reaching the final stretch of episodes, there was an inescapable feeling that built up inside me, both of excitement to see how such a unique, lighthearted, carefree show like this would handle finality and also one of dread at realizing that my time with these characters was coming to an end. Without giving anything away, this show might not have a big, emotional graduation scene or anything of the sort for its finale (\u00e0 la Angel Beats or K-On), but as mentioned before, Lucky Star isn't that kind of show. Instead, the final episode struck a chord of both pure, in-the-moment joy and sentimentality, perfectly capturing how these characters are living life to the fullest with their best friends at the end of what may be the best years of their lives, and it was everything I ever could have wished for.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t say for certain if this show will continue to be a favorite of mine over time or exactly how much I\u2019ll value the hours of conversation that I sat as an observer to, but I do know I\u2019m going to value just how much damn fun it all was. This show is an utter fucking blast.",

The characters are relate-able, the art is solid, there's honestly not many bad things I could say about the show.

By design, many potentially can be put off by the type of content that is incorporated in each episode. \r\nFor those expecting a show focused around the relationships of four ordinary school girls, prepare to be disappointed. Konata, Kagami, Tsukasa, and Miyuki are not normal, though some may be relativelymore normal than another. The characters are made to be off kilter, far from degenerates, but candidly, \"weird\" in their own ways. The chemistry between the four of them can be very entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nThe meta content is in of itself the story. Slice-of-life anime often do not have a meaningful plot, as it is a series of events. The students arrive at school, go to class, may engage in some activities and leave for home until graduation. Lucky\u2606Star almost embraces this fact too quickly to the point where there seems to be no direction at all. Conversation topics may seem random or even inane at times but that doesn't necessarily detract from the quality as long as you understand this is the joke. Ultimately, things happen and sometimes they don't. (Life is like that, no?)\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, as part of the target audience, I did like the hypermeta content and fourth wall type allusions. Though, it's difficult to appreciate all of the gags in the show, I was able to catch most of them. Perhaps I am in the minority when I say I enjoyed the show. I believe the overall and intentionally misleading design catches people off guard, making it a rather polarizing series to begin with.",

            "content": "PREFACE:\r\nLucky Star is stupid. Lucky Star is like, REALLY, REALLY stupid. But I love it. The genre of \"Funny slice of life anime\" could be called over-saturated by some, and a dead horse so far gone it's just dust now by others. But in the genre, Lucky Star is one of the few incredibly standout series that can manage to make you smile no matter what mood you're in. The only real way to describe the series is \"Dumb, silly fun.\" Or \"otaku bait\" but who cares? \r\nPLOT/CHARACTERS: It has no real overarching plot to it, it's just about 4 (and then 10) girls goingthrough high school. They each have their own traits and stuff, and they could be seen as one-sided, but who care's it's goddamn Lucky Star. You aren't watching this for gripping narrative or stellar character drama, you're watching it because you want to see a bunch of cute girls do silly things for 24 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nLucky Star is adorable. Like, it's really cute. The moe-looking art style really lends itself to silly comedy anime, and it fits Lucky Star like a glove. Each main character is distinct and you can tell them apart from a glance.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nLucky Star has one of the most memorable OST's i've listened to in a slice of life anime this side of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Punctuated with memorable and jolly piano tunes, as well as normal background music fare, it serves its purpose flawlessly, and I still hear the tunes in the back of my head as I go through my day-to-day life.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nThis is a personal aside, but I really love this series. My rating is a personal bias, sure, but I can't think of too many series that can make me smile no matter what mood I'm in. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nGo watch it if you haven't. If you don't like it you'll just be biased and be reading this to laugh at, in your mind idiots, and if you like the series as much as me you're just looking for confirmation bias. I dunno man, go form your own opinion, but I really like it. Also, yes episode 1 sucks, we all know.",

            "content": "Lucky Star is an anime that has years worth of reputation behind it, and while it eventually comes close to living up to that reputation, it doesn't do it soon enough to be an overall enjoyable experience. \r\nThe cornet scene in the first episode is the worst that Lucky Star gets. Thankfully, the series only goes uphill from there. While I don't think the show as whole really gets good until the second cour, it never gets as unbearable as listening to them talk about the top end of a pastry for 10 minutes. Even the non-cornet scenes in episode 1 were better than thecornet scene. \\n\\n\r\nRather than relying on the standard comedy fare of loud overreactions, the humor in Lucky Star is made up of references to anime, otaku in-jokes, and various aspects of everyday life. It relies on the viewer being in on the joke to be funny, so it's extremely hit-or-miss as to whether it works or not. The pacing of it all is really slapdash, with most scenes obviously being made up of random 4koma strung together. It makes the series feel like even more of an incoherent mess of random events than it already is. Fortunately, it improves a great deal after 12 or so episodes, and scenes start flowing closer to actual narratives. Though that could just be from an increase in anime original content, which is leaps and bounds better than when the show is adapting the manga. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Lucky Star act closer to real life people than most other SoL comedies, which makes them more relatable. It almost feels like it's a commentary on how characters in other \u201cslice of life\u201d comedies act nothing like how a normal person would. However, I feel that because of this,  the series keeps itself from becoming as entertaining as it should be. Nobody acts quirky enough for what they do or say to be funny. They talk about boring things in boring ways and it's sleep inducing. It persists until episode 13 when the secondary cast gets introduced and the series starts feeling like it has some life to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is well animated from beginning to end, even if most of it is wasted on still frames of talking heads. Everything stays on model and moves fluidly, as expected of KyoAni. However, the art style has never sat right with me. It\u2019s too chibified for me to buy that Lucky Star is supposed to a slow and relaxed SoL. It looks like it\u2019s supposed to be fast paced gag comedy, which just clashes with all the scenes of slow paced conversations. The most energetic part of the show is the OP, which makes Lucky Star look way more entertaining than it actually it. It's counter-intuitive to what the show is trying to be.\\n\\n\r\nI think Lucky Star's main problem, aside from just being boring, is just that it's aged horribly since 2007. There weren't as many comedy anime with all girl casts and slice of life settings back then. Azumanga Daioh, Ichigo Marshmallow, and Hidamari Sketch are the only real major ones that come to mind. Now, there's plenty of cute girl comedies out there which do the exact same things that Lucky Star does, while also having more coherent narratives and exciting characters to back it up. I think that Lucky Star would have aged far better if it were more like Azumanga instead. I get that Lucky Star wanted to be clever by being aware of SoL cliches, but being more cliched would be preferable to just being nothing.\\n\\n\r\nLucky Star does a lot of things right and that\u2019s the most disappointing thing about it. It could have been a really great show overall, but it spent half of its run-time stumbling in quality. It\u2019s an easily relatable show, so I can see why so many people like it. If there's anything that Lucky Star does better than other shows, it's being a slice of life that doesn't try embellishing it with extra details. It's probably not deserving of being considered one of the most well known SoL comedies out there, but it got good enough that I could be disappointed in the bad parts. Which is more than can be said for most shows out there.",

            "content": "BEFORE you start watching this anime, you have to watch The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya because this anime makes a lot of references to that anime and you'll just enjoy Lucky Star a lot more if you've seen Haruhi.\r\nFirst, I understand that Slice of Life animes like to focus more on the characters then the actual story of the anime, but what genre would an anime that doesn't focus on anything fall into? \r\nThat's what bothered me most about this anime was its lack of focus, it was almost like the writers had ADD. One moment we're listening to how Miyuki hates going to thedentist, but out of nowhere we jump to Konata playing video games at home with no transition. Every episode is like that! Every episode is just these unconnected funny moments! I got a headache from watching this anime; one second it's morning and the girls are going to school, but then the anime jumps to them leaving school in the afternoon!? \\n\\n\r\nHowever, even though there is no story of any kind, I did like the characters. I love Konata because she's an otaku and is always confusing people with these anime references she makes. Also, her dad is so weird (i.e. I think he has a schoolgirl fetish), but that's what makes him so interesting. Plus, Konata's cousin, Yui, is a cop, but she's so irresponsible. \\n\\n\r\nSo, it isn't like I flat out hate the characters, but the problem is they're very static. Part of the enjoyment of reading a book/manga or watching a movie/anime is seeing how the characters change and overcome problems. But this anime has no problems and the characters never grow closer or learn a lesson, there's no character development of any kind. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I'd recommend this anime to people just because I think its so unique (in that it's the only anime I've about nothing) that I'd want people to experience it and see how they feel about it.",

            "content": "~Story~ 6/10\r\nLucky Star is a series that has a loose storyline, but does not deviate from the big picture. After viewing a few episodes, it follows more like that of Azumanga Daioh and Ichigo Mashimaro. This is a slice of life story that is realistic, and is full of skits all around. Some viewers may scrunch their eyebrows at the questions the main characters ask, and the discussions that follow, and there are some punchlines that may be dubious to comprehend, but it does not affect the story overall. The story plot, which is weak, is strengthened with the\r\ncharacters, who reflect different personalities and persuasions.It's a good balance.\\n\\n\r\n~Art~ 9/10\\n\r\nThe motions of the characters are fluid, and it just feels like the animation is clean from the get go. The details might need to be a bit more improvement, but it's not as much an issue because it holds its own. Some of the scenes, like Tsukasa in the ocean during the beach vacation, or Kagami's tears after confessing to Konata about her weight gain, are indeed detailed, and are done tastefully well. The OP of the show even has some computer animations, too. The art, the direction, and the way Kyoto Animation did this series reflects their work of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, and its formula can be adjusted for any series that they work on. The art matches the emotions, the storylines, and the thoughts. Altogether, in spite of a need for a little more detail, it is another solid KyoAni effort. If I could give it an 8.5, I would, but a 9 should be close enough.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound~ 6/10\\n\r\nLucky Star has a rather nifty way of promoting silliness and ingenuity in one using their opening theme. \"Motteke! Sailor Fuku\" is a very upbeat and catchy song reminiscent of Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya's ending song \"Hare hare Yukai \" in which it also sports a wacky dance number. On the Other hand, the long list of ending songs is just too much and the only recurring theme is they are being played while the characters are singing in a karaoke bar!\\n\\n\r\n~Character~ 6/10\\n\r\nKonata Izumi, the main protagonist, has a fetish for chocolate cornets, as well as a number of anime and\\n\r\nmanga shows that are also popular. Not surprisingly, she is an avid follower of Haruhi Suzumiya (the seiyuu\\n\r\nof both characters is Aya Hirano), and you also have plenty of other anime and manga references. And in\\n\r\nspite all her bubblyness, and the catlike smile she loves to sport, she has skeletons in the closet, too: her\\n\r\nmother died when she was young. She is a \"Jill of all trades,\" the renaissance girl, and the otaku, all in one.\\n\r\nKagami Hiiragi is the tsundere-type of girl in this series, and a popular girl in her class. Aesthetically, she is an\\n\r\ninteresting person to pay attention to, more so than her sister Tsukasa, although there are attributes that make her unique. Miyuki Takara is your meganekko in the show, and after Konata talks with her about what her weaknesses are, she sees her in the moekko mold. The supporting characters have their unique quirks: Yui\\n\r\nNarumi, Konata's cousin, and her teacher, Nanako Kuroi, are akin to Yukari Tanizaki and Minamo Kurosawa\\n\r\nin AzuDai. Akira Kogami and Minoru Shiraishi, who both host the Lucky-Channel portion of the show, are a\\n\r\nboke-tsukkomi duo.\\n\r\nSome other well known characters outside of Lucky Star even cameo in the series, like Sergeant Frog. I feel\\n\r\nit may take away from the story, but these guest stars add another dimension to this sitcom of a series. Lucky\\n\r\nStar can also be thought of as a sitcom in a way, a situational comedy with punchlines at every twist and\\n\r\nturn.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~ 8/10\\n\r\nThis show make me smile, laugh, and bored. If you like SOL genre, I  recommend you to watch this.",

            "content": "Wow, the review section really is split in two here! So just a heads up, this show isn't for everyone!\r\nBut if (like me), you can appreciate the Slice of Life genre, then this anime should prove as good choice, as it's likely the most SoL dedicated show i've seen yet.\r\nSo, what's inside this 24 episode bundle? well a few aspects that make up this show include the comedy throughout, as it's a light hearted anime after all: and the art style compliments this greatly, it gives a cartoon-like vibe, and it should click with you especially if you like your colours vibrant!\r\nThe show is orientedabout the daily lives of high school girls, and so it's not a surprise that the story in terms of a plot is lacking, but as i said earlier, the \"story\" part of a SoL anime like this one is mostly conveyed through the characters. So this is where the divide occurs, do you think it's entertaining? or do you think it's pointless? \\n\\n\r\nDiving into the character aspect, i came to appreciate a good variety of personalities in Lucky Star, from the quirkiness of Konata, to the diligence of Kagami - and many more.  During the show, you come to find out more about the predominately female cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation throughout is effective, this referring to the combination of the emotive art, and the very casual dialogue. So If your looking for a break from the vast array of action shows out there, this one is a good bet - as all signs point to this show as being designed to entertain. - and that really is all there is to it. Yet  it all depends on your definition of \"entertaining\".\\n\\n\r\nFor me, this anime was a pleasure to watch, and as long as the cuteness and slightly cliche'd aspects don't throw you off, i'm sure you'll agree. \\n\r\nDon't you worry, because i'm coming to a  close now, but if you are to take\\n\r\nanything from this review: relax, forget your troubles, you are now in the right mind set to watch Lucky Star :)",

For people that can catch way more than that (like me), you will enjoy tremendously.",

            "content": "Lucky*Star is one of the most interesting anime out there, if one of the hardest to understand by outsiders.\r\nAgain, much like Azumanga Daioh, the execution of a normally dull slice of life storyline is great and has a lot of charm and humor. One of the things that made me love Lucky Star so much was the conversations the characters had. They were completely normal conversations that I find myself discussing almost exactly the same subjects with my otaku friends.\r\nThe characters are full of personality, especially our anime addicted heroine with the blue hair, Konata Izumi. Arguably one of the most interesting anime girls outthere, Konata says what all of us otakus have on our mind and even more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, sadly, I can only recommend Lucky Star to Otakus. Fans of the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya will especially love the constant references to the Haruhi series within Lucky Star. However, new comers to anime should leave this anime for later, as Lucky Star's humor mainly derives from the Anime/Manga/Japanese Videogame/Moe/Visual Novel subculture and those not versed in their ways will see jokes pass right over their head.",

            "content": "Lucky Star at the time of me watching it was the one I had heard the most about. The people in my university\u2019s anime club mentioned it all the time whenever we played anime-related games. My online friends have also told me about it as well as a couple of my classmates. After getting really bored one day I decided to blitz through the series. I now understand why everyone has seen this anime: It has to be the biggest love letter to anime fans ever! Cute girls, an otaku main character, and anime and video game references.  Here are my thoughts on it:\r\nStory:\r\nSincethis is a slice of life and school anime, there is no real story. It\u2019s just 4 girls going through daily high school life.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThe colours in this anime are almost blinding. There\u2019s so much colour in this anime. There\u2019s a lot of diversity just in the characters\u2019 hair colour. I think all the main colours are represented! Despite all the colour, it doesn\u2019t distract from the overall look. As for the characters themselves, they\u2019re drawn in quite nicely.  \\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNormally I mention music in the sound department but there isn\u2019t a lot of music to speak of in this anime. Music is only used at certain points. For example, whenever Konata is explaining her way of thinking or when she\u2019s making a joke, whenever Miyuki explains something to the group, or during certain events. Other than that, it\u2019s up to the voice actors to keep the sound quality up. All the voice actors, English and Japanese, did a good job with their characters although I preferred the English Tsukasa to the Japanese one and the Japanese Miyuki to the English one. Both Konata\u2019s and Kagami\u2019s voice actresses did great work and their performance was the same to me. A few people have complained about Patricia\u2019s English voice actor but people have to remember that because this anime takes place in Japan and she\u2019s from the US (in the show), they have to make her sound weird when she speaks to pretend like she has an accent. I\u2019m not a fan of her voice either but there\u2019s an explanation for you.\\n\r\nThe opening theme of the anime: \u201cMotteke! Sailor Fuku!\u201d is one hell of an addicting song. Just give it three episodes and you\u2019ll be hooked on it. At first I just thought it was plain weird but after a while the song just gets stuck in your head and refuses to let go. The ending song is always different but they\u2019re all references to one anime or another.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nEven though I\u2019ve only started watching anime this year, I know of most of the stereotypes there are in anime. I know each character usually represents a certain trait. From what I understand, Lucky Star\u2019s group of 4 each represents an anime stereotype. You have the joker and otaku Konata, the hot-headed, straight man Kagami, the airhead Tsukasa, and the smart, formal, glasses-wearing Miyuki. That\u2019s all right and all but it\u2019s the way that the creators poke fun at these stereotypes is what makes it funny. Konata makes references to these stereotypes especially with Tsukasa and Miyuki who are the stereotypical \u2018moe\u2019 characters and Kagami who is \u2018tsundere\u2019. Konata is constantly making references to the three girls and since Kagami is the straight man and the tsundere, Konata makes fun of her the most. As such, the two make a great duo when it comes to this anime. Over the half way point in the anime, they introduce a whole new set of characters that joins the main cast but they don\u2019t fit in all that well. I would have preferred it if they just kept the original cast in there for the duration.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nFor most people this will be the part that fluctuates the most. The more you know about anime and the more series you know, the more you will enjoy this anime. It also helps if you have knowledge about video games, particularly visual novels/eroges and JRPGs. They make references to so many things, it\u2019s almost impossible to get every reference unless you\u2019re a real otaku. But if you want a faster  way to understand most of the references, watch all of Kyoto Animation\u2019s stuff that they made prior to Lucky Star (Full Metal Panic: Fumoffu, Air, Kanon). But if you only wanted to watch one series before Lucky Star, make sure it\u2019s The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu). Almost half the references they make in the series come from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya with at least one reference per episode or two in the next tom make up for one they missed. There\u2019s one episode that devotes almost half its time to the series. I cannot stress it enough: watch The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya before Lucky Star! I made the mistake of watching Lucky Star first; don\u2019t make the same mistake I did! \\n\r\nBut anyway, I really enjoyed Lucky Star even the first time around and it gets funnier every time I come back to it since I\u2019ve watched some other series and now I can get another reference they make. Parodies in general are a love/hate thing for people but I loved this one.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIf you fancy yourself an anime expert, looking for something funny to watch, or just looking to relax, Lucky Star will suit your needs. I wouldn\u2019t recommend watching this series too early in your anime career unless you already know a lot about anime and its stereotypes as well as its terms. If you don\u2019t like parodies or moe-centric anime then steer clear but otherwise, sit back and have some fun!\\n\\n\r\n+ Rewards you for being an otaku! :P\\n\r\n+ Fun to re-watch as you progress along your anime-watching career\\n\r\n+ Konata is awesome!\\n\\n\r\n- requires anime knowledge beforehand\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 9 \\n",

            "content": "Lucky Star is one an anime where you ether love it or hate it. I've met very few people who have cone to think of it as just \"okay\" or \"good.\" If you can get past the fact that there is absolutely no story, then you might want to read on. If not, this is not your type of anime. \r\nPROS\r\nThe art in this anime is completely, absolutely, and 100% cute. Everything is colored very brightly, similar to Ouran High School Host Club, but much cuter (yes, I said it). It just has the feel of the ultimate teddy bear that you want to hugand keep holding on to. The characters themselves, look as bright as ever, especially Konata with her blue hair. It's drawn as cute as you can get (pretty much).\\n\\n\r\nI consider Lucky Star to be the king of comedic anime. Every joke works and is spot on. Konata is involved with most of these jokes, but of course other characters add-on their own sense of humor a lot as well. It's hard to find an anime that has comedy even close to the high level of humor that is within Lucky Star.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Lucky Star are, as you would imagined, extremely cute. Of course, the majority of fans love Konata more than anyone else, but others have a lot to add as well. Konata is a young girl who loves anime, computer-gaming, and video games. She's basically the girl version of many guys who love her as much as they do. Kagami is kind of your average school girl who tries her best at stuff and is, for the most part, the victim of Konata's jokes. Tsukasa is the sister of Kagami and is the shy girl of the series. She plays her part the way any anime character can. Lastly, there is Miyuki - the smart girl. Judging by these descriptions, you would think that there is no character development throughout the series. Well, you are correct, but there doesn't need to be. This is a slice of life anime that is about everyday things in life. Character development is not needed for such. \\n\\n\r\nCONS\\n\\n\r\nMany people seem to have a strong hatred for Lucky Star because they say it has no story. Others who love Lucky Star have said that it does. Facts are facts, though. And the fact is this - Lucky Star has no story. I don't care what you hear from other people or how much you are convinced that this anime does have a story. It doesn't. Now, this doesn't take away much if you are into slice-of-life anime. If you have a problem with such, then this anime will be your worst nightmare. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of every Lucky Star episode is a segment called \"Lucky Channel.\" This segment involves two characters getting into weird and awkward fights. Honestly, the segment didn't bother me at first, but as I saw more and more episodes, it got quite annoying. Maybe it is just me, but I can't stand those parts.  \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nLucky Star is one of the greatest anime series to ever hit television. It's hilarious in almost every single way and has some of the most likeable characters you will ever meet. The only downside is that there is no story, which may bother some viewers interested in such.",

Whether or not you like this show is very dependent on your anime prefrences. For example , if you need to have a very strong plot line in the show, and characters that develop over time. Don't watch this show. If you like funny , cute anime's that have really no point at all , this is the show for you. \r\nThe humour- I won't deny it, this show is funny., very funny. The characters have great personalities and arevery relatable. This show is the show you turn to after just finishing up a series that's very intense with a very complicated plot line. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story- The story, to say it bluntly, is lacking. VERY lacking. in fact, there is no story really. The episode are rather pointless. It's essentially like a whole series of fillers. This makes it very hard for people (like me) to sit down and watch it till` you finish. (and im sure we've all done that before). After just a few episode you'll start to get bored. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters- The characters personalities are great. They're very funny and the way the main characters interact gives for some good laughs. However, if you like to see characters develop any, you won't like this. The character's have NO development. at all.",

            "content": "I give this anime an 87/100\r\nI discovered Lucky Star on it's first run in 2007, right when I became totally ambitious about anime like I am now. Back then, I became obsessed with anything I laid my eyes on, like this and Gundam 00. I even have all the DVDs for Lucky Star sitting in a shoe box in my basement. When I watched it, I loved it. But now that I think about it, I don't think it's the masterpiece that it really wants to be. But I still love it.\r\nSo basically it's about high school girls just doing things. I don't mind storiesabout kids just doing normal things (well, normal in a Japanese perspective. I'm from America and you don't see stuff like this in my country) just as long as they're either executed properly or don't turn into a blatant ecchi fest. Thankfully Lucky Star's the former, even if I do confess that some particular episodes were a tad boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is...well, great. Not just great in terms of its use of color and just making characters move. It doesn't just make the main characters move around, but the people and objects in the background too! And it does this ON A REGULAR BASIS! That shows that KyoAni certainly has some kind of endless budget (along with A-1 Pictures and I think maybe even Madhouse when they want to) when it comes to animation. Sure, I like Kyoto Animation sometimes, but not because of Haruhi Suzumiya (don't like it. Never watched it and never will. Sorry!). The soundtrack...well, there isn't much music in the show. And when there is background music, it's kinda minimal. But I don't really mind.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course you can't have Lucky Star without a colorful cast of characters, not just because of appearance but personality as well. They're all perfectly diverse and different and relatable and THANKFULLY down to earth to a degree. My favorites have to be the Hiiragi twins, but for different reasons. Unfortunately, there are characters who either just confuse me or annoy me, and one of them happens to be Akira Kogami. I mean, what's the point of her being on the show? I don't get it. Plus her abuse of Minoru (WHY is the voice actor portraying an animated version of himself!? Was this in the original manga!?) really annoyed the heck out of me (and I was happy when he got back at her. Violently. Like a raging tiger).\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, you guys NEED to watch the English dub! It's GREAT! The English voices are all great! I especially love Yutaka's voice. She's voiced by Starfire from Teen Titans! And she can do little girl voices! Huzzah!\\n\\n\r\nSo long story short, Lucky Star's just your clone of Azumanga Daioh but with more anime and pop culture references than just slice of life comedy. I don't have that much to say about it, but even with it's flaws I still love it. And Kagami FTW! And not just because she's a tsundere and because she's voiced by Kari Wahlgren in the English dub!",

Lucky Star managed to have the right balance of more serious moments, along with teasing and comic relief. It followed the girls on their journey through high school, anime, and working. \r\nAs a computer nerd, I definitely related to Konata and her need to constantly binge watch TV shows and play computer games. This, coupled with the fact that they didn't make her character a typical, boy-crazy, sell-out with big boobs who just happened to likegeeky things, made me want to continue watching it. \\n\\n\r\nI thought it was adorable and fun, and a refresh from all of the popular action/supernatural anime that's popular right now. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend it if you're looking for an anime that you can watch casually, without having to worry about completely misunderstanding the story line if you miss or decide to skip a few episodes, and if you want something funny and cute. \\n\\n\r\n(I also learned the dance routine from the last episode. It was absolutely adorable.)",

It's very relaxed and is a lot about school life.\r\nStory - 7: This may just be me but i found the storyline very confusing. I don't understand very well what's going on half the time. But when I do, it's funny. The scenarios are very funny and there's plenty of humor. I wouldn't say that I laughed constantly, but I did snicker a few times per episode. Quite entertaining.\r\nArt - 8: The art is very childish. It fits the fun and relaxed setting and tone.\r\nSound - 8: Good sound quality. Nothing special here.\r\nCharacter- 10: Here's where I think the anime shines the most. The characters are very fun and lovable. All 4 girls are unique in their own way. I can easily say that people can connect with one of them. It was really fun to watch because of the characters. They really fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8: I really enjoyed the anime. It was funny. The only thing I don't really like is the complexity of the story line. I may simply be misunderstanding in which there is no real story line but yeah.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8: Great anime. I wouldn't say it's going to be a favorite. But I could suggest it to anybody who likes a good laugh and/or enjoys the school life animes. \\n\\n\r\nNote: There's no ecchi or love in this anime. I know love is really becoming an aspect about animes today, but there's little to none in this. Doesn't take anything out of the anime though.\\n\\n\r\nPlease enjoy!",

Like \u201cWhat the fuck, there\u2019s no plot?\u201d or \u201cThis fucking show has no pointless to show.\u201d Those are the anime fans complaints about this anime. Actually, why? Do they not read the synopsis before you started watching or look at the genre, please? After all, this is a slice of life, not a fucking mainstream anime.\r\nBut what makes this anime so interesting? This anime is very relaxing to watch, ranging from conversations about food, hobbies, and so forth. The things discussed by this anime isvery striking for our daily lives. Like for example, making a voice in front of the fan to make it sound like a robot, Japanese culture, otaku daily life, and others.\\n\\n\r\nKonata is an interesting otaku. Her father also has the same hobby for generations. Her own class teacher is also an Online Game Addict and an online friend. The story is also no less exciting with other anime. The character has a unique drawing made like a chibi. The Slice of Life and Comedy section are also very interesting, although this anime more focus on daily life so comedy is minimal. As I said earlier, this anime has no main story. So you are only seeing short stories with conversations that make you laugh. There is also cultural information and sometimes also incorporating other anime into the core of the story or arguably, Parody. For example Code Geass, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Gundam, Vocaloid, and so on.\\n\\n\r\nSound, BGM, and Sound Effect are very nice to hear let alone relaxing time scene. The passionate of opening with strange but pleasant lyrics. The ending can be considered very strange and interesting. The first episode until the 14th, we will be prepared vocals from Konata and friends. Until episode 15 to the end, there is an appearance that either what might be a producer or a hilarious seiyuu. Before heading to the ending, there is also something interesting that is Lucky Channel, an additional show and a little information about Lucky Star. Sometimes their conversations are very strange.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, for casual anime fans or slice of life maybe you can watch this anime. Not recommended for someone who just wants to find a plot or something. Although like that, this anime is also included in my favorite slice of life anime list.",

I do agree with that statement, but a lot of people didn't even bother to watch the rest of the episodes after seeing episode 1. After episode 5, the episodes now show improvement, and become even more enjoyable than when it first started.\\n\r\nIn my opinion, Lucky Star is one of the best slice of life anime out there, and actually inspired a lot of other slice of life series.

However if you give it time, say two or three minutes, it will start to hit a funny bone or two.  Lucky Star does something that few anime have done and does it will.  It takes the anime fan and makes you take a look at how \"the rest of the world\" sees you.  Because of this I now have a cool little figure of one of the characters setting on my entertainment center that my family gave me.  It was given to meafter my parents were helping me clean up for a Christmas party and I was watching Lucky Star.  The figure has a note permanently attached to it with one of her famous lines that my mother thought was fitting for me.  It sets on top of a stack of anime and every time I go and get an anime to watch i see the figure and hear her voice saying that line.  Thank you Kari Wahlgren.  Thought the art is a little \"cartoonish\"  it is very well done and the story is very well thought out and presented in a very entertaining way.",
