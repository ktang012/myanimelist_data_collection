            "content": "\"A series with splendid animation and soundtrack but poor storyline.\"\r\nMany many things have happened in the first season which was loosely based on the manga original, so logically we are expecting the storyline of Capu2 to continue from where season one left off. In fact, many many things do happen in Rosario + Vampire Capu2. They include the very exciting and daring (in the sense that they are pissing off the fans) censored fan service, more censored fan service, and still more annoying censored fan service. In terms of actual Rosario + Vampire story coverage, Capu2 literally got close to none with a few minorexceptions.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nSimilar to the previous season, Capu2 is also considered episodic (each episode is one mini standalone story). The \"monster of the week\" which received numerous criticism also returned though this time most of the \"monsters\" do not have much of an evil intention thus making most battles seem even more ridiculous (pointless) than before.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the first season which still semi followed the story from the manga, Capu2 is almost purely fillers as evident in episode 6. To wrap it up, Gonzo pretty much taken out all the actions in the story and replaced them with censored fan service (how can it be called fan service if they are censored with a bear?). Obviously fillers unrelated to the actual story tend to make fans unhappy, but from another perspective it can be rather refreshing at times because even manga readers wouldn't know what might come next! \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nUpon watching this anime, perhaps the first thing you'll notice is the supreme animation quality. Whether you are new to this series, or a fan from the manga original, the artwork in the anime is without a doubt impressive. It should be added that the animation quality throughout the series is very consistent, which certainly means a lot for a show intended for fan servicing. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nWhen compared to the first season, the OP and ED are certainly at the same level in terms of quality, thanks to our beloved Nana. It is plain evident that the OP and ED clips no longer relates to the story (unlike season 1's OP and ED which give hints to certain aspects of the plot), which is actually a good thing for this season since the production crew never had any intention of following the story anyhow. So a good OP and ED that matches their theme (ie. fanservice) would do the trick. \\n\\n\r\nGive Nana Mizuki tons and tons of credit for her amazing job well done for performing the OP and ED as well as being the CV for Moka. As stated in my Rosario + Vampire review, Nana has an amazing ability to sing thus allowing her to win the \u201cBest Musical Performance\u201d award in the first Seiyu Awards.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI was quite surprised when writing this review that there were hardly any character development in this season. Not only are the characters' hidden abilities STILL have yet to be included in the anime, but nothing really changed from the first season's ending (as expected from a filler series). Season one definitely did a better job in this department.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment + Final Thought:\\n\r\nThe heavy censorship really made the show very not enjoyable for me. If you want to watch the series uncensored, you'll have to wait for the DVD release. Overall, Rosario + Vampire Capu2 served its purpose as a filler and \"fanservice\" series.  Having strong animation quality and great sound track makes up for the lack of story and pretty poor character developments. I recommend this series for people who like good quality animation but if you want story development, you'll be best to skip this.\\n\\n\r\n*Note* The review is based on the broadcast episodes (ie. TV), the DVDs have no impact on the review.",

Well, there was a storyline for the first and last two episodes of this anime, and then 9 episodes of filler. 9 EPISODES OF FILLER IN A 13 EPISODE ANIME. Is this anime so inconsistent that it can't even stick to the plot for over two consecutive episodes?! Hence the low score.\r\nArt (8/10): The art is the best thing about this anime, is is fluid, clean, detailed, and rich in color.\r\nSound (6/10): The music matches the anime pretty well, ecchi all the way. It's the video with the music that is...interesting.\r\nCharacters (6/10): Thecharacters all have flat personalities: they all love the guy, and they are all...lets just say &quot;brave&quot; in public.\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10): Eh. Some new developments that were quite interesting. Mostly mumbo jumbo.\\n\r\nOverall: (5/10)",

            "content": "I'd like to set record straight and give you an honest review. The series, as a whole, first and second season are based, rather LIGHTLY, on the Manga of the same name. Keep that in mind.\r\nRosario+Vampire is a show that FEEDS off of fan service, harem stereotypes, and it's own unique sense of humor within it's story. Don't expect anything more than that. Take this anime as it is and you have a pretty decent show to watch and pass the time by.\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe story isn't like the manga. Not even anime adaptations are anything like the \"book\" it seems. Rosario+Vampire's story is chopped upinto pieces for the most part, and each episode is it's own slice of life for Tsukune and the gang. Repetition...often. Less than the first season though. Only in the last few episodes does a real epic story that runs smoothly begin to come together. Lots of fan service, lots of laughs because of how the harem is put together etc. don't expect much more and enjoy it for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nGonzo, as usual has done a fantastic job animating the show. It's very smooth, and nice to look at (no I'm not talking about the fan service). I've seen better, but Gonzo does a good job at keeping it consistently decent.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 \\n\r\nLike I said, Harem, Ecchi, whatever you want to call it, the soundtrack to this show fits it very well. The ever now famous \"Churu Churu Paya Paya,\" is a masterpiece score for some scenes in this anime, along with other songs that really pull the show together and make it's comedy valid. Add that up with amazing OP and ED songs for BOTH seasons by Nana Mizuki, and you have yourself a good anime soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:6\\n\r\nYou have Tsukune, the wimpy lead with a huge heart, you have your moe in Moka, you have your...Tsundere?...I suppose in Inner Moka. Kurumu is your typical flirt, Mizore is the all out stalker, Yukari is your loli, add in some adult themes and BAM generic anime harem right? WRONG. Though I rate it low for extreme lack of character development, the characters take on their own personas for the anime. BECAUSE it's set in a unique monster environment, each character has certain special traits about them. Given they are emphasized more on in the manga, but the anime at least gives you the basics. I can't say I've seen many other ecchis with a Vampire, Succubus, Snow-Woman, and Witchling all after one guy. Tsukune however stands out among the bunch, though he seems like a below average student with good intentions, there's more to him. He genuinely cares for the others, all as friends, and wants to be able to protect them. This is shown frequently in the series that though he is powerless, he's willing to fight, no matter what the cost. Which does lead to some interesting situations.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI laughed...I laughed. It IS enjoyable for what it is. A harem anime with your typical stereotypes played on well, with your BIG twist of them being monsters, and Tsukune being human. Decent bit of action to sate that hunger, and watching Tsukune progress ever so slightly as a character was cool. Don't come expecting anything more than laughs, fan service, and a few decent romantic/admirable scenes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nGood anime. Not the best, not terrible. They advertised as an ecchi, they sold an ecchi to the public. You view it as anything else and you'll hate it....but then that'd be your own fault. If you need to pass some time by, and you like the genre, give it a look. One of the best harem animes in a while, here's hoping for a 3rd season with more story and character development than we've seen!",

            "content": "Well, so it\u2019s come down to this\u2026 \u201cRosario + Vampire\u201d is an anime show directed by Takayuki Inagaki about, uh, well, gratuitous panty shots and full-blown harem mayhem. The story is straight-forward enough to actually make sense too: Tsukune Aono is your typical high school protagonist who plays the nice guy role way too well. One day, while heading to his mysterious new high school in the middle of what appears to be a dead forest/graveyard, he is run over on a bicycle by Moka Akashiya, a classmate of his. Immediately, these two seem to hit it off, until Tsukune discovers that Moka is actuallya vampire and the high school he\u2019s attending consists of nightmarish monsters. Eventually, Tsukune is forced to keep his human identity a secret for fear of his own life, while also attracting the attention of a group of girls all lining up to have sex with him, typical of your harem/ecchi show.\\n\\n\r\nI just want to make this known: \u201cRosario + Vampire\u201d is a terrible show. In fact, so terrible that I actually found myself really enjoying it at times. There seems to be a very basic formula to each episode too: Tsukune, being the dumbass he is, manages to get involved in some life-threatening conflict with a dangerous student or teacher, and Moka is forced to change into her \u201cbadass\u201d vampire form to save the day while the narrator, being a bat with the most annoying voice in anime history, inexplicably totals up the running time each battle took\u2026 for reasons I have yet to know\u2026 It\u2019s formulaic, yes, but that doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t have a ton of fun with it. There\u2019s a cheesy undertone throughout that makes it oddly entertaining, and while the nudity is flaunted around this show like clothing is illegal, it adds a kind of quirky vibe to the characters themselves. I shouldn\u2019t go too into detail with the other characters apart from our two protagonists because, well, they\u2019re cardboard cut-outs from other harem anime and are too uninspired to really give a damn.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, \u201cRosario + Vampire\u201d has a secret power: it is so facepalm-worthy, that at a point, your brain adjusts to the crude, dry humor and eventually you find yourself laughing a lot. The comedy in this show is hilarious when it wants to be, especially an episode when Tsukune is followed home by the stalking group of girls over summer break, and is introduced to their mother, who witnesses them in *ahem* compromising situations that leads her to believe her son is a sex fiend. It\u2019s actually one of the funniest episodes I\u2019ve watched since that exam episode in \u201cAngel Beats!\u201d. I feel like I shouldn\u2019t dismiss the strengths of the show either, because the last few episodes of the first season are legitimately great, as well as a bulk of episodes in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I enjoyed most of it, there\u2019s just also too much wrong with \u201cRosario + Vampire\u201d to fully recommend it. While it does have it\u2019s fair share of comedic genius and suspenseful moments, these are too rare in the show to really call it a saving grace. The chemistry between the \u201cso inoffensive, it hurts\u201d Tsukune and \u201cLucy from Elfen Lied 2.0\u201d Moka is actually pretty good too, and provides an ongoing gag that never gets tired. But overall, it\u2019s decent fun at best. If you just want to take a break from a serious anime, switch off your brain and let this soak in. Otherwise, watch \u201cLove Hina\u201d if you want great harem\u2026",

The boobs and stuff don't really bother me or interest me, i just like the comedy and the action or most likely the stupid stuff that happens \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nAmazing anime... Would recommend IF you're looking for a fun anime.\\n\r\nWouldn't recommend if you don't like the sexual scenes.",

He goes through random situations at a monster school.\r\nI feel like its all filler, really.\r\nAnd its an ecchi anime, itll have seens with ecchi. Then random they will start censoring things. You DO NOT censor anything in an ecchi anime unless its like hentai but not if its upskirt. Especially when they are hot sexy chicks.\r\nNo YOU DONT DO THAT!\r\nThe character is actually very good, the thing that ruins it is the main guy, hesreally not developed and doesnt have a unique personality at all.\\n\r\nMy enjoyment is not that high, cause i dont know where they are going with this.\\n\\n\r\nReally watch the first season. And save this at a time where you dont want to watch an anime where itll make you start having high expectation. Act like this is a Naruto filler except not as retarded and pointless!\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "Story? Who cares? You're watching this for the fanservice, and as a harem, you should be pleased with 13 episodes of 99%, \"Tsukune, Tsukune, take me.\" That's basically what it is; and it's implied ****SPOILERS**** that he and Moka (pink-haired) get together. \r\n****POSSIBLE SPOILERS FROM HERE ON IN****\r\nIt's funny, actually. I think there's only ONE kiss the entire second season between Tsukune and any of his four girl \"suitors,\" and it's not even Moka, I want to say it's Mazore (sp). \r\nAnyway, getting a little sidetracked there... you will enjoy this season if, like me, you enjoy fanservice and enjoy receiving a healthy dosage everyepisode. If I just described your tastes, come on in, enjoy the ride.\\n\\n\r\nStory: N/A\\n\r\nI won't rate something that's not present. Don't take it negatively, the season did what it had intended to do and did it surprisingly well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nR + V has always had solid artwork/animation. However, this would be a 10 if they had kept the animation standards up to what they were churning out in the beginning of R + V, season 1. I mean, take a look at the opening credits: that's some dang good animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nAbove average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nWith fanservice comes character development. Better than the first season for sure.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nLiked it more than the first, but that's really because of my taste in anime. I haven't read the manga, but I'm sure I'd have more negative things to say if I had. In hindsight, I would've liked to have seen a Moka x Tsukune kiss sometime during the series. Basically, it would've made the 13 eps. completely worth it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nHey, if you liked the first season, but you  just wanna feel giddy about relationship business, this one's for you.",

            "content": "I watched rosario+vampire capu 2 expecting something even more badass than the original show, and found that it was basically the same. There was still a bunch of meaningless fanserve (which I am all for) and it was still a harem which almost guarantees that nothing of deep import will happen.\r\nOnce again, the story follows tsukune; a complete pussy who seems to attract all the women, and moka the vampire whos into him. Also there the succubus, ice woman, witch, and this season brings us a brand new vampire. The new vampire is moka's sister kokua, and she is the first female character not tojoin tsukune's entourage... FINALLY! \\n\r\nAlso brought back from the original show is the stand alone episodes with a few conjoining at the end, but as ive said before this is how the manga was too so I will forgive it. However, while i'm on the topic of of the story; many people will expect a continuation from where the last season left off in the manga. This is not the case, in fact very little has anything to do with the manga itself at this point and now it is just a continuation of the first season instead of the manga.Now they are even tossing in filler episodes, I dont see why when they have so much manga to work with but whatever, I can and have forgiven them for some of the episodes that were really good, but some of the episodes in capu 2 just suck terribly so be on the watch for that. Another thing is that tsukune still doesn't use his vampire powers to open a can of whoop-ass on anybody this season either, so that kinda disapointed me.\\n\r\nAs before, the fights can be measured in a matter of seconds, and it would almost make more sense to cut em entirely but, what do I know. Also, in capu 2 you are about as likely to find the characters having a friggin sing-off than anything else, so hopefully you can get past the lameness of these situations or you will not survive this show.\\n\r\nOnce again the art is great just like the 1st season, and the characters are still a dynamic bunch, even if they havnt changed at all since season one. There was also a pretty good soundtrack for this show. I enjoyed watching capu 2 as a fan of the original manga and the 1st season, but maybe it can be said that you will enjoy this more if youve never read the manga... maybe. Still in all, I liked it, it was good stuff.",

This alone shows she knows; Despitethis however, through the rest of the series he shows no increase in ability and is referred to more or less as a human by the rest of the group and of course, for the rest of the series he still is unable to really fight. Why does this bother me so much? simple: they left out a huge plot point of development for the character.\\n\\n\r\nHe has already accepted the school is full of monsters and already accepted the girls defending him; however if they focused more on the fact that he is now a vampire rather than tossing in random episodes which, while funny provide no character or story build then the series would have been majorly better.",

Having not read the manga I can't comment on how true to it it was, but the plot was again the basic harem plot and a continuation from the first series with an added character in Moka's sister, Kokoa. Overall, the plot wasn't as good as the first, a lot of the stories didn't seem to lead anywhere new, whereas in the first season the episodes felt like they were all leading somewhere.\r\nTheartwork is still the same gonzo team that did the first and is still the same fantastic quality we have come to expect from them, the sound I'm marking down slightly on the first episode, mainly due to the overuse of irritating catch phrases, which seemed to appear just to disrupt the storyline in most places, still the same voice acters/esses are involved so the sound isn't changed from the first season. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all the same bunch from the first season with the additions of Kokoa and appearances from the mothers of the group, Ruby also appears a lot more in this season. This might have been OK, but a lot of the scripting for the newer characters made them annoying to watch, Kokoa especially was grinding my gears towards the end of it, and character development on Ruby was non existant, I was however glad that they did answer a few of my questions from the first season with Moka, all in all the characters were still fun to watch (Kokoa and Ruby aside).\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy the series, and its a very easy one to watch, it just suffers from the sequal hangover like so many anime titles seem to in that it just doesn't live upto its predecessor. Not to say that this doesn't give it a good go of it, definately worth a watch if you've been watching the first season, and for anyone new, watch the first season first!",

            "content": "Okay ummm, this wont be any in depth review...But in my opinion this was an incredibly painful series. This along with the first season played out in the same event format every time...(and i mean always)...the first 8-9 eps consist of Aono getting into trouble, tearing the rosary off Moka's chest....then as a result Moka saves the entire group...Now i understand this is a comedy but I think the variety of storyline in each episode made it such a drainer to sit through. Okay now in the last 2-3 eps of both seasons, its like they finally decide they want to be serious and havea storyline.....and for once they decide 'Hey, maybe we will let Aono do one cool thing before we revert him back to his damsel in distress useless self'. \\n\\n\r\nNow dont misunderstand, if they were going for this comedy without a plotline then its fine....But the fact they try to introduce something serious in the last moments of both seasons, makes me frustrated as too why I watched the first 9 useless episodes....Soooo yeah this is a pretty fresh review so I guess in contains some resentment over the forever repeating plotline of this show...But there u have it...\"Rosario + Vampire\" in a nutshell. \\n\\n\r\n(Over Rating a 7, cause im giving it the benefit of the doubt, as possibly the fact that its a comedy excuses it from have a varied plotline in each episode -.- )",

            "content": "This show has made me feel so many different emotions over the few months i've been watching it, and i honestly think this is my favorite Harem/Romance/Action anime there is....\r\nAnyways, starting with this story....The story continues from the first season, which was also really good. You have a lot of family drama here, as Moka's sister tries desperately to get her \"real\" big sister back, and on top of that, have many \"little\" stories here and there that doesn't really fit the main story line.... But again, being a Harem anime, there's a lot of what you would expect from that genre in this anime.But that doesn't, in my opinion, make this any less-good. For the story overall, it's pretty solid, but could use more STORY, if you know what i mean.\\n\\n\r\nI LOVE the artstyle for this anime, it's what i think about when i think of anime, and personally it's what brings me back to this series. But, not much else to say, it's all really nice \"looking\", heh, if you get me.\\n\\n\r\nSound is good, OP get's stuck in your head, but it's not that bad so i wouldn't worry. The English Dub, for both seasons is really good, and all the characters voices fits with them. Great job here.\\n\\n\r\nSo, being a harem anime you wouldn't expect there to be that many memorable characters, or even any character development at all. But this anime, like High School DXD, has really memorable characters, and personally they're some of my favorites. This anime really brings out very distinct personalities and feelings from each character, specially how a succubus DOESN'T use her powers to get Tsukune under her control, but yet, tries the \"old fashion\" style...and i like that. Like i said before, there are times when this anime does go way overboard with the fanservice, but deep down, this anime has very good character development, and memorable characters...\\n\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment is just perfect. I LOVE this series and will rewatch it many times to come. But i am sad how this series doesn't have another season, i feel like they could renew this series and finish the fight between the four girls, i really wanna see who Tsukune picks, but i think it's pretty obvious. OVERALL, i love this series, and i personally think if you haven't seen it, you need to watch. \\n",

            "content": "I found this season to be better from the last one. Season 1 of R+V was so bad, I had to consume alcohol to finish watching it. It was just a mess of a harem anime. \r\nIt seems however, that the creators of Season 2 agreed with me, and decided to create a second season to parody the first. Parodying your own series with your own series, a very bold move. \r\nThe series kept the harem in a form of stasis, with catfights erupting here and there even though the main guy is clearly into the vampire chick above and beyond the other girls. Thecharacters were dumb, and fought, and the story was all over the place but it seemed like every character in it, when they weren't at the center of the episode, knew just how bad this show was and expressed the sentiment. The Succubus being the one to least give a damn about criticizing the show. \\n\\n\r\nMAJOR SPOILER* \\n\r\n------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I'm going to give the season some credit on the final episode. It started to move from a silly parody into hitting at the heart of all harem animes. \\n\\n\r\nBoth Real Moka and The Succubus Kurumu actually came across as being genuinely hurt by Tsukune's feigned indecisiveness. Real Moka tried to maintain the relationship and attraction between her and Tsukune, but it just wasn't good enough for him because she wasn't the ditz. The character did seem genuinely sad as he just runs off leaving her to stand alone. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, in the final two episodes,  Kurumu lays it all out there as to why she likes him and how she's been with him from the start. She even gets he's not going to pick her and expresses being upset that he never even looked back at her as heads into the castle. \\n\\n\r\nI felt these scenes to be somewhat sad, and indicative of the result of a harem anime. Someone(s) is going to end up heart. I'm glad they briefly touched on this before resetting the status quo. Both of these two had somewhat genuine reasons as to why he should care/be with them. Yet he chooses the stereotype instead. \\n\\n\r\nThe witch girl ultimately admits to basically being down for a polygamous threesome with Tsukune and Moka, so I don't buy her romance,  and the Ice Girl, maybe because I missed something, didn't seem to be genuinely in to him so much as she wanted to be into some guy. \\n\\n\r\nEnd of SPOILER* \\n\r\n---------------------------\\n\\n\r\nthe final episodes which, combined with the series being self aware and parodying itself, bumped this show a point above its predecessor. \\n\\n\r\nIf the show took itself a bit more seriously in the second series, with a focus on tying up loose ends, it could have at least earned a hard 6 out of 10. A break up of Tsukune's harem, and the character split from episode 11 (you'll know when you see it) would have done wonders. It could have turned into a slight critique of a harem instead of a parody, which given the stereotypical and often blind behavior of the characters, would have served the series well and could have still resulted in a happy ending. \\n",

            "content": "\"A series with splendid animation and soundtrack but poor storyline.\"\r\nMany many things have happened in the first season which was loosely based on the manga original, so logically we are expecting the storyline of Capu2 to continue from where season one left off. In fact, many many things do happen in Rosario + Vampire Capu2. They include the very exciting and daring (in the sense that they are pissing off the fans) censored fan service, more censored fan service, and still more annoying censored fan service. In terms of actual Rosario + Vampire story coverage, Capu2 literally got close to none with a few minorexceptions.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nSimilar to the previous season, Capu2 is also considered episodic (each episode is one mini standalone story). The \"monster of the week\" which received numerous criticism also returned though this time most of the \"monsters\" do not have much of an evil intention thus making most battles seem even more ridiculous (pointless) than before.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the first season which still semi followed the story from the manga, Capu2 is almost purely fillers as evident in episode 6. To wrap it up, Gonzo pretty much taken out all the actions in the story and replaced them with censored fan service (how can it be called fan service if they are censored with a bear?). Obviously fillers unrelated to the actual story tend to make fans unhappy, but from another perspective it can be rather refreshing at times because even manga readers wouldn't know what might come next! \\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nUpon watching this anime, perhaps the first thing you'll notice is the supreme animation quality. Whether you are new to this series, or a fan from the manga original, the artwork in the anime is without a doubt impressive. It should be added that the animation quality throughout the series is very consistent, which certainly means a lot for a show intended for fan servicing. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nWhen compared to the first season, the OP and ED are certainly at the same level in terms of quality, thanks to our beloved Nana. It is plain evident that the OP and ED clips no longer relates to the story (unlike season 1's OP and ED which give hints to certain aspects of the plot), which is actually a good thing for this season since the production crew never had any intention of following the story anyhow. So a good OP and ED that matches their theme (ie. fanservice) would do the trick. \\n\\n\r\nGive Nana Mizuki tons and tons of credit for her amazing job well done for performing the OP and ED as well as being the CV for Moka. As stated in my Rosario + Vampire review, Nana has an amazing ability to sing thus allowing her to win the \u201cBest Musical Performance\u201d award in the first Seiyu Awards.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI was quite surprised when writing this review that there were hardly any character development in this season. Not only are the characters' hidden abilities STILL have yet to be included in the anime, but nothing really changed from the first season's ending (as expected from a filler series). Season one definitely did a better job in this department.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment + Final Thought:\\n\r\nThe heavy censorship really made the show very not enjoyable for me. If you want to watch the series uncensored, you'll have to wait for the DVD release. Overall, Rosario + Vampire Capu2 served its purpose as a filler and \"fanservice\" series.  Having strong animation quality and great sound track makes up for the lack of story and pretty poor character developments. I recommend this series for people who like good quality animation but if you want story development, you'll be best to skip this.\\n\\n\r\n*Note* The review is based on the broadcast episodes (ie. TV), the DVDs have no impact on the review.",

Is this anime so inconsistent that it can't even stick to the plot for over two consecutive episodes?! Hence the low score.\r\nArt (8/10): The art is the best thing about this anime, is is fluid, clean, detailed, and rich in color.\r\nSound (6/10): The music matches the anime pretty well, ecchi all the way. It's the video with the music that is...interesting.\r\nCharacters (6/10): Thecharacters all have flat personalities: they all love the guy, and they are all...lets just say &quot;brave&quot; in public.\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10): Eh.

            "content": "I'd like to set record straight and give you an honest review. The series, as a whole, first and second season are based, rather LIGHTLY, on the Manga of the same name. Keep that in mind.\r\nRosario+Vampire is a show that FEEDS off of fan service, harem stereotypes, and it's own unique sense of humor within it's story. Don't expect anything more than that. Take this anime as it is and you have a pretty decent show to watch and pass the time by.\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe story isn't like the manga. Not even anime adaptations are anything like the \"book\" it seems. Rosario+Vampire's story is chopped upinto pieces for the most part, and each episode is it's own slice of life for Tsukune and the gang. Repetition...often. Less than the first season though. Only in the last few episodes does a real epic story that runs smoothly begin to come together. Lots of fan service, lots of laughs because of how the harem is put together etc. don't expect much more and enjoy it for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nGonzo, as usual has done a fantastic job animating the show. It's very smooth, and nice to look at (no I'm not talking about the fan service). I've seen better, but Gonzo does a good job at keeping it consistently decent.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 \\n\r\nLike I said, Harem, Ecchi, whatever you want to call it, the soundtrack to this show fits it very well. The ever now famous \"Churu Churu Paya Paya,\" is a masterpiece score for some scenes in this anime, along with other songs that really pull the show together and make it's comedy valid. Add that up with amazing OP and ED songs for BOTH seasons by Nana Mizuki, and you have yourself a good anime soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:6\\n\r\nYou have Tsukune, the wimpy lead with a huge heart, you have your moe in Moka, you have your...Tsundere?...I suppose in Inner Moka. Kurumu is your typical flirt, Mizore is the all out stalker, Yukari is your loli, add in some adult themes and BAM generic anime harem right? WRONG. Though I rate it low for extreme lack of character development, the characters take on their own personas for the anime. BECAUSE it's set in a unique monster environment, each character has certain special traits about them. Given they are emphasized more on in the manga, but the anime at least gives you the basics. I can't say I've seen many other ecchis with a Vampire, Succubus, Snow-Woman, and Witchling all after one guy. Tsukune however stands out among the bunch, though he seems like a below average student with good intentions, there's more to him. He genuinely cares for the others, all as friends, and wants to be able to protect them. This is shown frequently in the series that though he is powerless, he's willing to fight, no matter what the cost. Which does lead to some interesting situations.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI laughed...I laughed. It IS enjoyable for what it is. A harem anime with your typical stereotypes played on well, with your BIG twist of them being monsters, and Tsukune being human. Decent bit of action to sate that hunger, and watching Tsukune progress ever so slightly as a character was cool. Don't come expecting anything more than laughs, fan service, and a few decent romantic/admirable scenes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nGood anime. Not the best, not terrible. They advertised as an ecchi, they sold an ecchi to the public. You view it as anything else and you'll hate it....but then that'd be your own fault. If you need to pass some time by, and you like the genre, give it a look. One of the best harem animes in a while, here's hoping for a 3rd season with more story and character development than we've seen!",

            "content": "Well, so it\u2019s come down to this\u2026 \u201cRosario + Vampire\u201d is an anime show directed by Takayuki Inagaki about, uh, well, gratuitous panty shots and full-blown harem mayhem. The story is straight-forward enough to actually make sense too: Tsukune Aono is your typical high school protagonist who plays the nice guy role way too well. One day, while heading to his mysterious new high school in the middle of what appears to be a dead forest/graveyard, he is run over on a bicycle by Moka Akashiya, a classmate of his. Immediately, these two seem to hit it off, until Tsukune discovers that Moka is actuallya vampire and the high school he\u2019s attending consists of nightmarish monsters. Eventually, Tsukune is forced to keep his human identity a secret for fear of his own life, while also attracting the attention of a group of girls all lining up to have sex with him, typical of your harem/ecchi show.\\n\\n\r\nI just want to make this known: \u201cRosario + Vampire\u201d is a terrible show. In fact, so terrible that I actually found myself really enjoying it at times. There seems to be a very basic formula to each episode too: Tsukune, being the dumbass he is, manages to get involved in some life-threatening conflict with a dangerous student or teacher, and Moka is forced to change into her \u201cbadass\u201d vampire form to save the day while the narrator, being a bat with the most annoying voice in anime history, inexplicably totals up the running time each battle took\u2026 for reasons I have yet to know\u2026 It\u2019s formulaic, yes, but that doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t have a ton of fun with it. There\u2019s a cheesy undertone throughout that makes it oddly entertaining, and while the nudity is flaunted around this show like clothing is illegal, it adds a kind of quirky vibe to the characters themselves. I shouldn\u2019t go too into detail with the other characters apart from our two protagonists because, well, they\u2019re cardboard cut-outs from other harem anime and are too uninspired to really give a damn.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, \u201cRosario + Vampire\u201d has a secret power: it is so facepalm-worthy, that at a point, your brain adjusts to the crude, dry humor and eventually you find yourself laughing a lot. The comedy in this show is hilarious when it wants to be, especially an episode when Tsukune is followed home by the stalking group of girls over summer break, and is introduced to their mother, who witnesses them in *ahem* compromising situations that leads her to believe her son is a sex fiend. It\u2019s actually one of the funniest episodes I\u2019ve watched since that exam episode in \u201cAngel Beats!\u201d. I feel like I shouldn\u2019t dismiss the strengths of the show either, because the last few episodes of the first season are legitimately great, as well as a bulk of episodes in the second season.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I enjoyed most of it, there\u2019s just also too much wrong with \u201cRosario + Vampire\u201d to fully recommend it. While it does have it\u2019s fair share of comedic genius and suspenseful moments, these are too rare in the show to really call it a saving grace. The chemistry between the \u201cso inoffensive, it hurts\u201d Tsukune and \u201cLucy from Elfen Lied 2.0\u201d Moka is actually pretty good too, and provides an ongoing gag that never gets tired. But overall, it\u2019s decent fun at best. If you just want to take a break from a serious anime, switch off your brain and let this soak in. Otherwise, watch \u201cLove Hina\u201d if you want great harem\u2026",

That simply means, more harem!(i hope)\r\nArt : 9\r\n -I don't have to say it but all the characters(girls) look great! i mean, not in a  perverted way but in a bishoujo type of way. They never stop to amuse us with there art. i mean, look at shirayuki's and kurumu's mothers!\r\nSound : 10\r\n -You guys gotta admit, the op kills! Discotheque is one of few songs thatare made with a theme which isn't new(disco theme) to the 21st century with such a cool beat! not to mention the part in Ep3 where Mizori and Kurumu had a song battle during music class. And also their BGmusic is really something!\\n\r\nCharacter : 9\\n\r\n -Talk about Kokoa's twisted love, that really is quite cute. Not to mention the saying, &quot;Like Mother, Like Daughter.&quot; Look at Shirayuki's mom. she was stalking Tsukune behind the table! \\n\r\nEnjoyment : 9\\n\r\n -From the previuos scores i gave, there is no need for me to explain why i gave this score.\\n\r\nOverall : 9\\n\r\n -Such a great combination of characters into one anime.

There were quite a few episodes of random nothing-ness that had really nothing to do with the plot, but they still had their comedy/romance aspects that kept you watching.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nThe story wasn't really that developed in either of the seasons, I wish they would have gotten a bit more in depth with Tsukune and his new vampire powers. It was still a hilarious storyline, I didn't mind all that much\r\nArt 9/10\r\nI really liked the art style in this anime. The characters looked nicely drawn and symmetrical.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound effects were pretty nice, I didn't expect much from them since it was going to be a comedy/harem type deal. However, the english voice acting was spot-on. You can't go wrong with good ol' Haberkorn as a main :D The song in the second season was pretty beastly, I dug the bass line in the disco song very much. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters were all pretty likable and had different traits. Specially the girls HUEHUE. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI really liked watching this anime even though there were a bunch of random episodes. These types of anime don't exactly need a good story-line to be likable, but it would help.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nThis was a really good 2 season anime. Even though a lot of people dissed it because of the story-line not matching the manga and all that, I still liked the comedy/harem aspect of it.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this review! first of many to come C:",

The story follows a very cliche harem/ecchi plot, which is a guy surrounded by girls in a magical world, and each one of them dig him.\r\nFrom there, you can already understand what's going to happen. For the first season, it's tiny sub-stories with a dramatic ending. BUT the thing is that the humor in this story totally makes up for the lack of serious plot. And for you ecchi lovers..well there's only two things that we are pleased with and this show has it and you know what I mean.\r\nOverall I'monly giving a rating to the first season, which is an 8/10. As for the second season, I have high expectations and so far they have been fulfilled.",

MIZORE FOR THE WIN!!!\r\nSound:\r\nThe sounds are happy and joyful, they don't get annoying if they are re-used. \r\nThe voice acting is okay... But damn the English dubbed is amazing i don't like watching anime in eng dub but this anime FREAKING nails it!!\r\nCharacter:\r\nHmm most of them can get really annoying *cough* THE SUCCUBUS. Oh! Can'tforget about the loli witch... Mizore is easily the most calmed and less annoying and Moka, i like her Original form with white or silver hair IN MY OPINION.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI just kept watching this anime in my bed in excitement i don't know why it's just so funny and cool. The boobs and stuff don't really bother me or interest me, i just like the comedy and the action or most likely the stupid stuff that happens \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nAmazing anime...

You DO NOT censor anything in an ecchi anime unless its like hentai but not if its upskirt. Especially when they are hot sexy chicks.\r\nNo YOU DONT DO THAT!\r\nThe character is actually very good, the thing that ruins it is the main guy, hesreally not developed and doesnt have a unique personality at all.\\n\r\nMy enjoyment is not that high, cause i dont know where they are going with this.\\n\\n\r\nReally watch the first season.

You're watching this for the fanservice, and as a harem, you should be pleased with 13 episodes of 99%, \"Tsukune, Tsukune, take me.\" That's basically what it is; and it's implied ****SPOILERS**** that he and Moka (pink-haired) get together. \r\n****POSSIBLE SPOILERS FROM HERE ON IN****\r\nIt's funny, actually. I think there's only ONE kiss the entire second season between Tsukune and any of his four girl \"suitors,\" and it's not even Moka, I want to say it's Mazore (sp). \r\nAnyway, getting a little sidetracked there... you will enjoy this season if, like me, you enjoy fanservice and enjoy receiving a healthy dosage everyepisode. If I just described your tastes, come on in, enjoy the ride.\\n\\n\r\nStory: N/A\\n\r\nI won't rate something that's not present. Don't take it negatively, the season did what it had intended to do and did it surprisingly well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nR + V has always had solid artwork/animation. However, this would be a 10 if they had kept the animation standards up to what they were churning out in the beginning of R + V, season 1. I mean, take a look at the opening credits: that's some dang good animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nAbove average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nWith fanservice comes character development. Better than the first season for sure.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nLiked it more than the first, but that's really because of my taste in anime. I haven't read the manga, but I'm sure I'd have more negative things to say if I had. In hindsight, I would've liked to have seen a Moka x Tsukune kiss sometime during the series. Basically, it would've made the 13 eps. completely worth it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nHey, if you liked the first season, but you  just wanna feel giddy about relationship business, this one's for you.",

            "content": "I watched rosario+vampire capu 2 expecting something even more badass than the original show, and found that it was basically the same. There was still a bunch of meaningless fanserve (which I am all for) and it was still a harem which almost guarantees that nothing of deep import will happen.\r\nOnce again, the story follows tsukune; a complete pussy who seems to attract all the women, and moka the vampire whos into him. Also there the succubus, ice woman, witch, and this season brings us a brand new vampire. The new vampire is moka's sister kokua, and she is the first female character not tojoin tsukune's entourage... FINALLY! \\n\r\nAlso brought back from the original show is the stand alone episodes with a few conjoining at the end, but as ive said before this is how the manga was too so I will forgive it. However, while i'm on the topic of of the story; many people will expect a continuation from where the last season left off in the manga. This is not the case, in fact very little has anything to do with the manga itself at this point and now it is just a continuation of the first season instead of the manga.Now they are even tossing in filler episodes, I dont see why when they have so much manga to work with but whatever, I can and have forgiven them for some of the episodes that were really good, but some of the episodes in capu 2 just suck terribly so be on the watch for that. Another thing is that tsukune still doesn't use his vampire powers to open a can of whoop-ass on anybody this season either, so that kinda disapointed me.\\n\r\nAs before, the fights can be measured in a matter of seconds, and it would almost make more sense to cut em entirely but, what do I know. Also, in capu 2 you are about as likely to find the characters having a friggin sing-off than anything else, so hopefully you can get past the lameness of these situations or you will not survive this show.\\n\r\nOnce again the art is great just like the 1st season, and the characters are still a dynamic bunch, even if they havnt changed at all since season one. There was also a pretty good soundtrack for this show. I enjoyed watching capu 2 as a fan of the original manga and the 1st season, but maybe it can be said that you will enjoy this more if youve never read the manga... maybe. Still in all, I liked it, it was good stuff.",

This alone shows she knows; Despitethis however, through the rest of the series he shows no increase in ability and is referred to more or less as a human by the rest of the group and of course, for the rest of the series he still is unable to really fight. Why does this bother me so much? simple: they left out a huge plot point of development for the character.\\n\\n\r\nHe has already accepted the school is full of monsters and already accepted the girls defending him; however if they focused more on the fact that he is now a vampire rather than tossing in random episodes which, while funny provide no character or story build then the series would have been majorly better.",

Having not read the manga I can't comment on how true to it it was, but the plot was again the basic harem plot and a continuation from the first series with an added character in Moka's sister, Kokoa. Overall, the plot wasn't as good as the first, a lot of the stories didn't seem to lead anywhere new, whereas in the first season the episodes felt like they were all leading somewhere.\r\nTheartwork is still the same gonzo team that did the first and is still the same fantastic quality we have come to expect from them, the sound I'm marking down slightly on the first episode, mainly due to the overuse of irritating catch phrases, which seemed to appear just to disrupt the storyline in most places, still the same voice acters/esses are involved so the sound isn't changed from the first season. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all the same bunch from the first season with the additions of Kokoa and appearances from the mothers of the group, Ruby also appears a lot more in this season. This might have been OK, but a lot of the scripting for the newer characters made them annoying to watch, Kokoa especially was grinding my gears towards the end of it, and character development on Ruby was non existant, I was however glad that they did answer a few of my questions from the first season with Moka, all in all the characters were still fun to watch (Kokoa and Ruby aside).\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy the series, and its a very easy one to watch, it just suffers from the sequal hangover like so many anime titles seem to in that it just doesn't live upto its predecessor. Not to say that this doesn't give it a good go of it, definately worth a watch if you've been watching the first season, and for anyone new, watch the first season first!",

Okay now in the last 2-3 eps of both seasons, its like they finally decide they want to be serious and havea storyline.....and for once they decide 'Hey, maybe we will let Aono do one cool thing before we revert him back to his damsel in distress useless self'. \\n\\n\r\nNow dont misunderstand, if they were going for this comedy without a plotline then its fine....But the fact they try to introduce something serious in the last moments of both seasons, makes me frustrated as too why I watched the first 9 useless episodes....Soooo yeah this is a pretty fresh review so I guess in contains some resentment over the forever repeating plotline of this show...But there u have it...\"Rosario + Vampire\" in a nutshell. \\n\\n\r\n(Over Rating a 7, cause im giving it the benefit of the doubt, as possibly the fact that its a comedy excuses it from have a varied plotline in each episode -.- )",

            "content": "This show has made me feel so many different emotions over the few months i've been watching it, and i honestly think this is my favorite Harem/Romance/Action anime there is....\r\nAnyways, starting with this story....The story continues from the first season, which was also really good. You have a lot of family drama here, as Moka's sister tries desperately to get her \"real\" big sister back, and on top of that, have many \"little\" stories here and there that doesn't really fit the main story line.... But again, being a Harem anime, there's a lot of what you would expect from that genre in this anime.But that doesn't, in my opinion, make this any less-good. For the story overall, it's pretty solid, but could use more STORY, if you know what i mean.\\n\\n\r\nI LOVE the artstyle for this anime, it's what i think about when i think of anime, and personally it's what brings me back to this series. But, not much else to say, it's all really nice \"looking\", heh, if you get me.\\n\\n\r\nSound is good, OP get's stuck in your head, but it's not that bad so i wouldn't worry. The English Dub, for both seasons is really good, and all the characters voices fits with them. Great job here.\\n\\n\r\nSo, being a harem anime you wouldn't expect there to be that many memorable characters, or even any character development at all. But this anime, like High School DXD, has really memorable characters, and personally they're some of my favorites. This anime really brings out very distinct personalities and feelings from each character, specially how a succubus DOESN'T use her powers to get Tsukune under her control, but yet, tries the \"old fashion\" style...and i like that. Like i said before, there are times when this anime does go way overboard with the fanservice, but deep down, this anime has very good character development, and memorable characters...\\n\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment is just perfect. I LOVE this series and will rewatch it many times to come. But i am sad how this series doesn't have another season, i feel like they could renew this series and finish the fight between the four girls, i really wanna see who Tsukune picks, but i think it's pretty obvious. OVERALL, i love this series, and i personally think if you haven't seen it, you need to watch. \\n",

            "content": "I found this season to be better from the last one. Season 1 of R+V was so bad, I had to consume alcohol to finish watching it. It was just a mess of a harem anime. \r\nIt seems however, that the creators of Season 2 agreed with me, and decided to create a second season to parody the first. Parodying your own series with your own series, a very bold move. \r\nThe series kept the harem in a form of stasis, with catfights erupting here and there even though the main guy is clearly into the vampire chick above and beyond the other girls. Thecharacters were dumb, and fought, and the story was all over the place but it seemed like every character in it, when they weren't at the center of the episode, knew just how bad this show was and expressed the sentiment. The Succubus being the one to least give a damn about criticizing the show. \\n\\n\r\nMAJOR SPOILER* \\n\r\n------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I'm going to give the season some credit on the final episode. It started to move from a silly parody into hitting at the heart of all harem animes. \\n\\n\r\nBoth Real Moka and The Succubus Kurumu actually came across as being genuinely hurt by Tsukune's feigned indecisiveness. Real Moka tried to maintain the relationship and attraction between her and Tsukune, but it just wasn't good enough for him because she wasn't the ditz. The character did seem genuinely sad as he just runs off leaving her to stand alone. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, in the final two episodes,  Kurumu lays it all out there as to why she likes him and how she's been with him from the start. She even gets he's not going to pick her and expresses being upset that he never even looked back at her as heads into the castle. \\n\\n\r\nI felt these scenes to be somewhat sad, and indicative of the result of a harem anime. Someone(s) is going to end up heart. I'm glad they briefly touched on this before resetting the status quo. Both of these two had somewhat genuine reasons as to why he should care/be with them. Yet he chooses the stereotype instead. \\n\\n\r\nThe witch girl ultimately admits to basically being down for a polygamous threesome with Tsukune and Moka, so I don't buy her romance,  and the Ice Girl, maybe because I missed something, didn't seem to be genuinely in to him so much as she wanted to be into some guy. \\n\\n\r\nEnd of SPOILER* \\n\r\n---------------------------\\n\\n\r\nthe final episodes which, combined with the series being self aware and parodying itself, bumped this show a point above its predecessor. \\n\\n\r\nIf the show took itself a bit more seriously in the second series, with a focus on tying up loose ends, it could have at least earned a hard 6 out of 10. A break up of Tsukune's harem, and the character split from episode 11 (you'll know when you see it) would have done wonders. It could have turned into a slight critique of a harem instead of a parody, which given the stereotypical and often blind behavior of the characters, would have served the series well and could have still resulted in a happy ending. \\n",

            "content": "Rosario + Vampire was the first anime show I have watched other than Pokemon 10 years ago. As far as the story line is concerned, I found the concept unique and it was an enjoyable series to watch. The story line is taken lightly and not as serious as Death Note or Code Geass, but overall it has its perks. The synopsis of Rosario + Vampire is that Tsukune Aono has failed to get into High School but due to a mix-up is sent off to a school for monsters. He there meets a girl named Moka Akashiya and they quickly become friends. Despite hisnewly found friendship, he still has to worry about the \"no humans\" policy that would lead to an execution if he were ever caught. The art in this series is spectacular and honestly one of the bests out there. When compared to other series, this one takes the win for best art next to High School DxD in my opinion. It is a laughable series that is enjoyable to watch. It may not be for everyone seeing how it is still an ecchi. This series, however, has light sexual messages, which for some people is great. For the others (perverts), there is not much to see so maybe stick to DxD. Even though this series does not have the best story line, I still enjoyed it and recommend it.",

            "content": "* This is my first time writing a review, so if you think i need to improve or something. Please don't hesitate to tell me *\r\nSo just by reading this review, im pretty sure that you have watched Rosario+Vampire 1 already, for obvious reasons. Therefore, you probably know a brief idea about the anime already. So im just gonna get started on what i like/dislike about this anime.\r\nI have to say that the storyline of this anime is better than the first one however when i think about it.. it is kinda the same. Being a \" inner-moka fan\" i definitely liked this one betterthan the first season because there are more scenes of the inner moka,and i also got to know more about her in this season. It was also really interesting and entertaining meeting new characters such as the girls parents and family. Also how these girls resemble their parents is just fun to watch, especially when they get into fights and all that. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the Art, if u have watched the 1st season you will know that the art is amazing. The characters are all well drawn and the artist ( or whoever you call them) uses amazing colors in the anime which draws your attention and gives you a \"WOW\" feeling. For example when it is snowing.. the colors that they use is so amazing. It makes me want to be there and see it in real life ( i dont know if its weird to say this, its a magical feeling).\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite thing about this anime, is the soundtrack. Nana Mizuki has done such an awesome job with the song she sang.. i just love it! The director puts in songs at the right moment, not just randomly which is good. Anyway all the songs in this anime is just catchy and i ll promise you that you will find yourself downloading the soundtrack when u first listen to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are interesting, and im just kinda disappointed that they didnt show more of Kururumu or the others girls. And in my opinion the outer moka is sometimes to annoying. Some scenes that annoy the crap out of me it when Tsukune and Moka just have those random scenes where they stare at each other. And i also feel that some characters should have more scenes then some but alwells. Another thing that annoys me is when Moka's rosario gets taken off her and there's always this guy explaining what happens to moka when it gets taken off her. I understand why they would tell the audiences for the first time seeing and so, but telling us what was happening to her everytime Tsukune took the rosario off her whenever there was a fighting scene? was just too much.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, i give it a 7/10 it wasn't a masterpiece however it wasn't bad. I just felt that they rushed the ending.. and they they shouldve made the storyline abit longer and give audiences some more intense fighting scenes ( but i have to say that fighting scenes in the first season is much more better than the 2nd season). So lets hope that they'll make another season that will be much better!!\\n\\n\\n",

I felt I should write a little review on it because I didnt find an of the others to be very positive nor helpfully informative enough. I hope I do my best!\r\nLet me first explain the style of this is Comedic High School Ecchi.. The only thing I found somewhat annoying between this and season 1 was the censored fanservice.. but at times I also found it sort of funny. I think if you enjoyed the first season.. Watching the second season is a must.\r\nI.. unlike some of the other reviewers found alot of character development..Therewere episodes that were almost entirely based upon one of the central characters..The girls are still charming and beautiful in their own ways.. Moka, Yukari, Kurumu, and even the gorgeous Ruby..still have infectious personalities.. that are hard to resist..and the addition of Kokoa makes things interesting..\\n\\n\r\nThe story for the second season is good.. and it follows the first seasons basic concept of a guy trying to deal with being thrown into a strange school.. and making new friends.. with strange circumstances.. I know at times it doesnt follow a basic \"flow\" and the storyline changes.. but I never found any of the episodes to be boring.. they all contained the same comedic happenings as the first season..\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is great.. as expected... and the opening song gives you a feeling of the fun and laughs that will follow in the episode..and I think fits well..\\n\\n\r\nI hope this helped anyone not being able to decide on watching the second season or not.. I definately suggest it.. I gave this an overall 8.. for its genre it was not a disappointment.",

But I also moved it up because of its ability to improve on developing the characters while still maintaining what was working in the first season. \r\nWhile I admit, the repetitive pining the female protagonists partake in over Tsukune started getting a little annoying, it was still entertaining enough for me to not really care all that much.\r\nOn top of this, reviewers pointed out how plot development was lacking andlimited to the first episode and last 2 episodes, but I felt the season was entertaining enough to again over look what was missing. But to expand on the plot development, it did start to actually get really interesting which led to another fault - it ended here! It could have definitely gone further with additional seasons easily. I really look forward to any additional seasons they might make.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I enjoyed this series quite a bit and it prompted me to pick up the manga right away in hopes of developing the plot and characters further.",

Well,its kinda fucking messed up and all,but it isn't terrible. It is full of ecchi,humor,and action,but it is full of strange episodes like(minor spoiler). The witch girl turning into a adult, Mokas little sister touching all over her etc. It isn't any better then the first season, but its still pretty good.\r\nStoryline7/10-NO SPOLERS. Tsukune is back in Yokai academy, home to monsters. Moka, the pink haired girl in love with Tsukune is back,along with Kurumu, Mizore,Ruby, the witch girl,and Moka'slittle sister.(shes a new character). Everyone does the same thing all over again. It is enjoyable,but its the same as the first season. Well,sort of,but you will find out :). Its good,but not amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter7/10-The characters are good. Mizore is still the coolest character.(she really is cool. Like freezing. LOL). I like Moka's inner part of herself. Mostly because of her badass appearance. Most of the characters  are enjoyable,but that witch girl is so annoying,and Moka's little sister isn't any better. Mizore's mother and Kurumu's mother are so strange. Character development is lacking,which is also why its only a 7. The characers are good, but ive seen better.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack6/10-Rosario Vampire has a fair sound track. Well,its noting amazin. The new opening theme song isn't that good in my opinon.(unlike the other one in the first season). THe music is okay,but I guess its enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nArt8/10-I love the art. Its so colorful and bright its just amazing. The characters look okay and all. There is nothing wrong with the art. Its great. Not perfect,but I still REALLY liked it. Just as good as the first season.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment7/10-Yeah,I enjoyed this anime. ECCHI animes were never good,but this one isn't to  bad. I enjoyed it quite a bit. Much more then I thought, because most ecchi anime are shit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall7/10-Its good. Not my favortive, but still good. Rosario Vampire Capu2 isn't anything like a masterpiece, and t doesn't in prove anything over the first season,but its okay to watch. It isn't a anime I recommend,because it isn't that good as other series, but for ecchi fans,enjoy.",

            "content": "This is a direct sequel to the first season, and is very similar in many ways. However, overall I'd have to say that for the most part it's a good amount better. The loop is often the same, in that there's some sort of issue, they're all in trouble, Tsukune removes the Rosario, Moka defeats said trouble, and they all move on. However, instead of focusing on Tsukune for the most part as was usually the case in the first season, here the focus is generally on other characters. The build up also feels like it matters a lot more than the conclusion with thefinal scene of Moka destroying enemies being not as important, even occurring in the background at times, and when it was the focus it felt like it deserved to be. This allows to show off the other characters a lot more, and though there wasn't that much in the way of character or relationship development for the most part, what was there felt pretty solid, and furthermore it adds more variety and prevents the show from getting repetitive, which combined with the fact that the show is primarily focused on comedy and being amusing over the actual plot, it works quite well. This is the case for most of the show, and hence I think most of the season is a pretty solid improvement over the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThis falls apart however at the end, where things get pretty epic, but things also get kind of strange. The finale for this season finally has Tsukune taking a more proactive and impactful role in the plot, and finally actually getting into a real fight. However, his motivation for doing so felt completely off, in that he simply felt selfish. That combined with the fact that most of the show had him seem pretty clearly going for Moka, but the ending has him being indecisive at the end, makes him being the villain of the episode actually feel right in a way, but that in itself doesn't feel right either. One of the main reasons it felt strange was that it further developed inner Moka, and showed she had range to her personality, wanting to belong and such, but it also gave a reason for her being sealed in the first place that was pretty dumb. Hence, it felt difficult to be completely all right with Tsukune simply sealing her away again for the other Moka, especially as inner Moka was there first, and really it doesn't seem any more justifiable than what Kokoa wanted. Hence, I feel very conflicted about the entire relationship. This was an area that I think the show should have probably avoided entirely, because though they probably didn't intend the viewer to think that much about it, they got pretty close to it, and it really doesn't fit the tone of the show at all. Hence, it was an incredibly strange note to end on. I will admit though that the song and accompanying footage at the end was pretty great.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack I quite liked just like the previous season. The OP was really good and the ED was good. There was a lot of insert song usage as before, but as before usage was only decent. The art, designs, and style were good as before. The animation was improved and was mostly pretty good, with this time not having as many noticeable cheap shots. The action got a bit better but still wasn't worth much. The comedy was still solid.\\n\\n\r\nA major improvement over the first season for the most part, though with a really awkward finale.\\n\\n\r\n8/10",

            "content": "Story (7) The story of Rosario to Vampire Capu2 follows on a year after the first season. The newspaper club members are returning for their second year. What follows is a season which builds on the core characters as well as the progression of Tsukune and Moka's relationship. The story varies which each episode, much like the first season, while having a main arc (the main arc in the first season was more to do with Tsukune attending a high school for monsters and introducing characters, while this season focuses more on those characters as well as Tsukune and Moka). The story in the individualepisodes for me was generally good, although certain episodes I feel had a weaker story than others, especially in relation to the main arc.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (8) The animation is much like the first season, though the characters seem to be a bit more active in their movement and poses. The greatest difference between the two seeasons animation wise is the opening sequence, with the dancing at times proving hypnotic.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9) The sound is relatively the same. Sound is rarely bad in anime in my opinion (unless it is a particuraly bad dub, which Rosario to Vampire Capu2 thankfully isn't)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9) The main cast from the original are joined by a few newcomers, all of which are good characters that fit into the world. Certain episodes focus more on certain characters, and it is in these episodes that the show really shines for me. The fleshing out of characters and the simple fact that the spotlight is not constantly on Moka (something I didn't really like from the first season) is refreshing and adds a certain endearing quality to the season. The only part that lets this category down is the bits where the series reverts to the formula of simply having all the female Newspaper Club members fight over Tsukune.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8) Overall, this series is really good. For fans of the first season, Capu2 simply builds on the foundation, bringing new ideas and new scenarios. For people who weren't too keen on the first season because of the Harem elements, Capu2 DOES keep those elements, but tries to explore the characters more as best it can. A must-watch series, a 'save for a rainy day' series for everybody else.",

            "content": "In the end Rosario to Vampire was a really enjoyable experience.\r\nThis anime is not without its faults. Censorship is strong, which really reduces all of the injected fanservice. The fanservice art is also quite \"half-assed\". If you watch this anime, you need to look for the value in how adorable their romance is. This series contains tons of relationship and character development disguised as fillers. A common critic of this series states that the story is poor but a lot of it is actually relationship content and exploration of the characters. However, I think they could have done this while placing emphasis on a moremeaningful plot. This anime also overly sexualizes a child which is in poor taste for me. \\n\\n\r\nAll that aside, Rosario really shines in some areas. The music fits the mood of the series perfectly and it's quite adorable when the characters have musical performances where they sing songs about their love. The romance that developed is very cute and compelling. There are multiple moments that will have you rolling over laughing as well. All in all, this anime could best be described as cute and cuddly, sprinkled with decent fanservice.",

I'm a fan of the manga series were the MC goes from the wuss hiding behind his harem of super powered beauty's, to a badass who's cranked it up to level 11 and leading the battle. Overall the art was the one redeeming feature but the fan service completely over shadowed any real plot development.  If your the type to read the manga as well as watch the anime, I would differently skip the anime for this series;but if you must watch it, get it over with first before you move on to the manga.  Otherwise you will face a large amount of disappointment.",

It didn't break any boundaries with its art but it did a good job of doing what it always does.\r\nSound- Again, nothing pops out to amaze the viewer but it doesn't hurt the anime either. The sound is there just to make it less awkward than pure silence.\r\nCharacter- The characters were bland. Only one character developsin the whole anime. All the other characters stay the same and just keep rolling that way.\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Some of the episodes it felt like a job rolling through but others made the who ride worth it. The beginning and end of the whole season was great but the middle was basically trying to find things to fill it in.\\n\r\nOverall- It was a good anime. I don't regret watching it.

Kokoa is constantly trying to get Moka to revert back to her original self, causing all sorts of problems for the cast.

Moka is one of my all-time favorite characters now. They fit nicely with each other as well.\r\nThe one problem I have is the ending, it left things too open.

The ending screams that there's another season coming, there are just too many things that haven't been done yet.\\n\\n\r\nI hope they continue this series, or even do a reboot now that the manga is coming to an end. They diverged after the first season since the second season began before the manga was finished. It's got quite an American audience since Netflix started featuring it. Sadly, it's just a hope for now.\\n\\n\r\nBut I highly recommend this show to anyone, especially harem lovers. It's one of my favorites.",
