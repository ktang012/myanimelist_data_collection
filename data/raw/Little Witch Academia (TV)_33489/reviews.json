I'm gonna become an amazing witch one day and make the whole world gasp in surprise!\"\r\nAkko Kagari Little Witch Academia (TV) 2017 (Episode 5)\r\nOut of all anime that came out in winter 2017, Little Witch Academia (TV) caught my interest and it's the only show from that season that had to potential to great not counting squeals.\r\nI have previously seen the short movies for Little Witch Academia and I really liked a lot. However, I won't be mentioning or comparing the TVs with the short movies because I want to review the TV series by its own identity.\r\nNow after all that isshow worth watching or it's just an another lame seasonal anime.\\n\r\nHellow everyone this is Shawn aka PhantomKurata and I will be reviewing Little Witch Academia (TV) and with that out the way let's begin.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story of Little Witch Academia follows Akko Kagari who aspires to be a great witch like her idol Shiny Chariot even tough she has no witch blood in her. Akko sets off to go to Luna Nova Magical Academia where she can to achieve her dream. Along the way her during to Luna Nova Magical Academy she befriends two other witches Sucy and Lotte. Now they magical adventures in Luna Nova Magical Academy begins as Akko tries to achieve her dream by being a witch like Shiny Chariot.\\n\\n\r\nI found the story of Little Witch Academia to be pretty great.\\n\r\nIt's very similar to Harry Potter in terms of concept and setting but unlike Harry Potter where it centers around Harry growth as so one day, Harry can defeat his antagonist. Little Witch Academia is mostly episodic as most episodes are very different from one another. \\n\r\nIf you're looking for a magical academy drama like Harry Potter then you won't enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile mostly being episodic Little Witch Academia deals with great themes of achieving your dream, appreciating others, determination, change, and friendship.\\n\\n\r\nThe worldbuilding for Little Witch Academia is great as it gives relevant names for every location in the show. We get certification of how some witches can only use magic in certain places than others,  We get information about the history of magic, how the students in Luna Nova Academy must obey the rules such as not leaving campus without permission to no allowing them to go to locations that Luna Nova that is off limits for students.\\n\r\nI could go on about how great the worldbuilding is but it will end up spoiling the show and I don't want anyone to get spoiled.\\n\\n\r\nI also really like how it references a lot of other Gainax/Trigger anime as well as humor and jokes in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing that I want to mention is the second half has a more serious tone and it's more plot driven and to be honest I really liked the second half more than the mostly episodic first half. \\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia (TV) is a very engaging/well-written series that will never bore you and it will keep you smiling from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story for Little Witch Academia (TV) to be pretty awesome and it's very refreshing when compared to most anime that are coming out nowadays.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharterers.\\n\r\nThe characters in Little Witch Academia is honestly amazing and very likable in they own ways. Not to mention they have great character chemistry to one and another.\\n\r\nAkko is a great female lead.\\n\r\nShe's a very energetic and determined girl who wants to achieve her dream despite her shortcomings by being an ordinary girl with no witch blood.\\n\r\nSome people may find her annoying in the beginning but in my opinion, she's the perfect type of annoying you can relate to from start to finish.\\n\r\nNot mention he she has great and believable character development especially in the second half. Plus she's very relatable.\\n\r\nShe's one of my favorite female protagonist in recent memory.\\n\\n\r\nSucy is the aloof, sarcastic and sadistic character of the show who likes to use Akko as a text subject for her experiments. I can't say anything more about this but all I say is she a fun and likable character overall but I wish she had more screen time in the second half of the show as well as having a bit of character development in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nLotte is a rather patient and studious character of the group. She also a supportive character who likes help her friends mainly Akko.\\n\r\nLike Sucy she's a fun and likable character. Also like Sucy I wish she had more screen time in the second half as well a bit character development because I found her to very interesting and likable. \\n\\n\r\nDiana is a serious esteemed witch from a long line of witches who is the top student in knowledge and magic.\\n\r\nShe's honestly my favorite character in this show. \\n\r\nI personally like her personality as well her development as the series progresses on. Not to mention like Akko she very relatable.\\n\r\nOverall Diana is an awesome that I adored from start to finish \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are also great.\\n\r\nThey are very likable, enjoyable to watch from start to finish and they brought more life to the show\\n\\n\r\nOverall besides the lack of screen time for Sucy and Lottte in the second half, this character cast was great from start to finish.\\n\r\n9.5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nVisually Little Witch Academia looks good for the most part\\n\r\nThe background scenery is defined by thin lines and washed out colors. They are very well detailed and well drawn but they are mostly static.\\n\r\nThe characters designs minus Sucy have very similar size and body types. However, the characters faces and movement are very different for each character and it gives them a personality of they own. Immediately by watching the show, you will see that Akko is an energic, Sucy is an old sarcastic girl or Diana is a hotty top student.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of actual animation, the character movement is easy to follow. Things like the motions of clothing hair, ribbon caps, magical effects or broomsticks are what gives the visuals a lot of their flare. Plus it's very well animated.\\n\r\nOverall the visuals are great but can be a bit repetitive at times in terms of size and body types\\n\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is almost entirely orchestral pieces and consists of a handful of themes with lots of variations and rearrangements of each.\\n\r\nThese orchestral pieces are amazing, very enjoyable to listen and have a purpose for each scene.\\n\r\n Michiru Oshima did an amazing job with this soundtrack as it makes each scene more impactful. \\n\r\nThe sound effects used in this show is great. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and endings themes are really good.\\n\r\nFrom the happy adventurous of the first opening Shiny Ray to the more slightly serious opening that some foreshadowing towards the end of the opening, \\n\r\nBoth ending themes are really\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is simply top notch.\\n\r\nAll of the seiyuu's did a great job for voicing each character. \\n\r\nI cannot about the dub because it hasn't been released yet but the dub of the TV series will be available on Netflix soon.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the soundtrack was amazing the openings and ending themes were great and the voice acting was wonderful and well acted.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia (TV) is a breath of fresh air when compared to most anime that are coming out nowadays. Cough *Eromanga Sensei*\\n\r\nThe story was great and very enjoyable, has great worldbuilding, great theme exploration, a strong likable cast from start to finish, great visuals and animation.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing as well as the opening and endings and voice acting is wonderful. \\n\\n\r\nIt has some minor hiccups such as lack of screen time for certain characters in the second half as well mostly repeating the size and body types for the character designs but these minor hiccups are easily ignored due how great the story and characters were. \\n\\n\r\nThis is easily one of the best anime to ever come out in the last two years.\\n\r\nUnlike Eromanga Sensei that represents everything that is wrong about modern anime and it's also one of the worst anime I have ever seen in my life. Little Witch Academia (TV) represent everything that is great about modern anime and for that reason, I give the show as well as the director You Yoshinari full respect.\\n\\n\r\nIt may not be the perfect anime but compared to most anime that I have seen over the years this show almost represents everything that I love about this entire anime medium. \\n\\n\r\nThis show will make you laugh, it will make you cry and it will make you smile with joy and determination. \\n\\n\r\nThank you to all the creators for making this wonderful anime and I hope this gets a Blu-Ray/DVD release in the future.\\n\\n\r\nI give Little Witch Academia (TV) a 9.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway this was Shawn aka KurataTrigger and I will see you guys next time.\\n",

            "content": "Disclaimer: the following review/analysis is oriented towards those who finished the series, and as such, there will be spoilers.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nLittle Witch Academia is Yoh Yoshinari's precious child, who is one of the most important and iconic animators this industry has. It's at the same time, a love letter to it, with clear intent, wanting to be a message of hope to everyone looking to be part of it eventually. Unfortunately, he is an animator, not a writer (though he most likely wasn't alone in this), and said intentions are not backed up by the execution of the piece once examined under the cold eye of themonocle-wearing critic who thinks too highly of themself despite of their own contradiction-riddled writing, yet far from a complete dreck. This \"love letter\" has fundamental problems with its setting, plot, pace, characters, and a strangely ambiguous thematic simplicity that I can only attribute to the core idea Yoshinari tried to bring forward getting in the way of the show's story, and that's without touching details like the amounts of redundancy in the dialogue or some poorly paced scenes that end with no momentum. Little Witch Academia is an anime that always finds a way to squander its potential, and I'll proceed to explain myself.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, lets talk about anime and animators. How is this related to our little witches? The show acts like a metaphor to the journey of the young animator in the industry, an ideal represented by Kagari Atsuko (Akko), where the magic world symbolizes anime and its institutions. Many animators are inspired from a very young age by one piece of animation that resonates with them, which leads them to choose said profession. The world of animation (and anime) is alive as long as there is new people that wants to work in it, and it's also necessary that veterans are able to train them for that.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the obvious Nine Old Men (google it) reference within the show's lore through the Nine Old Witches, there are more nods to this metaphor. The show alludes to3DCG animation with Croix and her technology entering the scene, and the end of the series calls back to the cycle that perpetuates the existance of magic/anime in this world. During the spectacle that the outcome of the final showdown against Croix's mad missile generates, we see people being enchanted again by magic, and then we cut to a close shot of a little girl being amazed by it, symbolizing that Akko has inspired a generation younger than her to pursue the road of magic, same as how Chariot inspired her, in the same way this series and its climatic ending may inspire those who see it. This is why the show is a love letter to anime.\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, Little Witch Academia is without a doubt the most consistently high quality production Trigger has made (Kiznaiver exists, but this is also two cours), with a similar artstyle to western cartoons, mixed with limited animation techniques here and there like heavy use of smearing, and intense focused \"sakuga\" moments that manage to impress on a technical level. All of this coupled with a brilliant OST composed by Michiru Oshima, that adds in a fantastic way to the tone the series has both in its heavier and lighter moments.\\n\\n\r\nPoetic, isn't it? But the praise stops here.\\n\\n\r\nAbout pacing, Little Witch Academia starts with Akko finding the broken underexplained McGuffin known as Shiny Rod in her road to Luna Nova, which is followed by a series of western inspired episodic adventures of little importance that will either reveal some detail about the world or a quirk about the characters. We don't get exposition regarding the words plot up until episode 11, and the main antagonist is only introduced by episode 14. What follows during the second half is a weird alternance of proper plot related episodes and episodic content similar to most of the show's first half, making for some jarring contrast between episode and episode. Even then, the show finds its focus again around episode 21, and rushes to the conclusion. It's uneven, and tries to tie things up way too fast, with too little to keep itself interesting in the first half, and too much to cram in the end without forcing it.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no inherent problem with an episodic structure, many magical girl anime like Princess Tutu, Full Moon wo Sagashite and Shoujo Kakumei Utena got it right. The problem with Little Witch Academia is that most of these episodes are bland, employ clich\u00e9 plots, are cheap excuses to force screentime for irrelevant characters, and overall give way too little substance (or have little value) besides spectacle, which again wouldn't be a problem if the series wasn't trying to get you invested in anything else than that. At the same time, the series has a strong tendency to forcefully validate Akko's disruptive and intrusive behaviours, usually through the implementation of some plot device that achieves this (often the Rod) and often resolves the conflict. Then, one other time the show rewrote a character from the opposing side to reach a resolution, during Diana's arc, where after showing her aunt as this one dimensional snake lady, it's revealed that she actually cares about the family's legacy, and will try to keep it up while she follows her dream in Luna Nova. This makes the resolutions idealized and convenient. Little times a conflict is solved by the agency of our characters or an instance of personal growth, and while the series often returns to the status quo, these rare ocasions end up being the best episodes because there's real catharsis to be found in them. These exceptions are episodes 11, 13, 14, and from episode 21 onwards where the show focus on what matters, exploring Akko's relationship with Chariot, the past of the latter, and finally resolving who Akko wants to be. Even then, it takes 21 episodes of justifying everything with passion and simple motivations until something more interesting happens with her character. Finally, this ends up making Akko a character favoured by the plot, result given by the rather low stakes situations the show puts her in, which are resolved with no real growth from her part (see the exceptions). The series hides in Akko, whose story is about maturing and personal growth, someone with a Mary Sue treatment. Akko is rewarded for who she is and what she represents, not for the person she grows to be during her journey, in the same fashion as Hajime from Gatchaman Crowds (but Crowds doesn't pretend that there is a journey for Hajime, who is a stand-in for most of her show's ideas).\\n\\n\r\nOther of the problems Little Witch Academia has is its handling of the setting. We see some places and factions, but they are vaguely explored or barely important, like witches from other places who appear on one episode and are never brought back again, meaning that there is little to no expansive worldbuilding outside what's relevant inmediately to the story. We learn that the witches had a 1500+ years old debt with a dragon because no one took responsibility to learn/recover dragon language in order to read or translate the damn contract, but then Diana comes with her teenage wisdom to save the day and put the drake on his place, since she DID study/learn dragon language apparently. The \"adults are useless\" trope is implemented to push this idea of the incomeptence veterans have for training the new generations, drawing a parallel with the anime industry metaphor. In doing so, said execution generates a tonal clash regarding a situation about the world that should be taken more seriously, compared to how the series treats other similar moments, and it's one of the elements that leads the series to validate otherwise questionable developments, for how it makes impossible to take the old witches in charge seriously (and end up being fairly irrelevant to the plot... as expected anime, you can't have people that make sense solving your plots, can you?). For example, there's no ambiguety when Ursula defends Akko from being expelled/suspended from Luna Nova after clearly breaking the rules (Akko avoiding being expelled for Ursula's intervention and instead being suspended would make for a nice moment of self-reflection, that still rewards her efforts in some way, adding complexity to both her character and the outcome of her actions), or that never in the second half the authorities of Luna Nova question or check what Croix is doing in her suspicious omious tower (which is in reality a minor contrivance).\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the faction of british gentlemen, which includes Andrew. It's implied that they finance Croix, but it's never explored why, and out of them \"hating witches\" (which is also not explored) they don't have an interesting dynamic with the world. Andrew himself is sidelined, and his role in the climax is very small (Gentlemen: -Shut down the cameras! Andrew:-No! I believe in these witches! Gentlemen: -Ok.) but he is more important as an ear to Akko, as well as someone who she inspires the capacity of trusting witches, eventually. He also gives Akko the idea of being herself, by herself, rather than by Chariot.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the side cast (Diana, Chariot, and Croix are mains) have personalities defined by only one trait or superficial quirk. Jasminka eats a lot, Constanze does tech stuff and doesn't talk, Sucy is sadistic and experiments with mushrooms, Lotte is shy, likes Nightfall and has fairy magic, Diana's minions are just that, and Amanda is a tomboy archetype with nothing else. All of these are characters you can define in half a sentence, that exist to represent how Akko through her forceful behaivour managed to have friends who act later as an emotional cushion for her. It's incredibly basic and boring seeing how Akko instead of building most of these relationships through mutual understanding, she's forced into being accepted by external plot elements. The exception to this is her relationship with Diana, which has its problems, but nontheless it has conflicts, a dynamic, and only when Akko helps her to face her family and understand her problems is when they really become friends, and it make sense that it's Diana the one that puts Akko back on her feet in episode 23 after the twist of episode 22. Which leads us to the next point.\\n\\n\r\nThe story between Chariot and Croix, once revealed, destroys Akko emotionally, who eventually gets back on her feet once Diana conforts her. The problem is that besides using a lot of contrived friendships as a reinforcement (note also how little Lotte and Sucy appear during the second half of the show), this makes Diana's character being limited as an emotional support to Akko, and the show in its intent to portray its metaphor, ends up giving more value to her passion above Diana's ethic towards hard work, which she upheld all her childhood (or even more important than Akko's own resolve to work hard and not take shortcuts, since it's never brought up in their exchange!). This leaves a mixed message, almost on some wish-fulfilling tone, extremely simplified and idealistic. Luckily the series doesn't intend to depreciate hard work (scenes like Akko meeting Woodward and Diana's arc suggest this), yet ends up doing it because of its execution.\\n\\n\r\nThe revelations themselves during episode 22 (extended to 23) give new meaning to the series in many layers, and make it interesting again in a moment where it was feeling empty. Even then, the series limits its potential again by making Chariot ultimately a victim of Croix's deception, which goes back to a simplistic characterization that doesn't innovate nor is particularly interesting, if not for her burden and regret regarding her negligency (and projection of her wishes on Akko) towards her student. Meanwhile, the show makes its best to paint Croix as a mustache twirling villain (who does unquestionably bad things) to redeem her at the last second when everything goes wrong, without implying that her actions in the end have been punished, since she had \"good intentions\". But that's probably sadism on my part. The true villain of the series is Woodward and the garbage tier guidance they offered to the girls (Chariot and Croix) which is never genuinely addressed even if it's where Croix's character and misguided actions come from.\\n\\n\r\nThe conflict during the last act is based on the antagonist accentuating negative emotions in the population with a fishy football game acting as a cathalyst, to then gather said emotions as magic energy and destroy the seal of Grand Triskellion. Finally, the climax goes from a final boss battle where she finds out that the power she sought wasn't what she thought it was, to said boss (Croix) losing control of her technology, (in the same way Chariot lost control of her magic collection technique) unintentionally releasing a mass destruction missile built by the uncontrolled rage of the mob. With the conflict now not being focused on Croix, everyone is now a good person, and all that's left is convincing the world that magic is cool, which happens. The thing is that this outcome is forced, since Chariot and Croix are suddenly able to livestream and comment the event from thin air (an event that occurs in the stratosphere(!)) which enables people to see it and do the 180\u00b0 turn from almost starting a war to cheer and give them energy (don't ask how, Grand Triskellion does the trick) so that Diana and Akko can defeat the missile. This is, again, as it's an habit of the series, idealistic and forced plotting because magic is wonderful. Friendship is magic, and passion is what's most important. The major credit I can give to the finale is that it's extremely climatic, features the best bits of animation in the whole show, it's somewhat possible to just take what it presents at face value for that, and closes the meta-text the series has been building with its analogy regarding the anime industry in a clever, subtle way, even if the communicated message is ambiguous without this interpretation.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, Little Witch Academia had good intentions, but not the chops to carry them forward. In its ambition, it leaves blurry many details of its execution, which falls apart analyzing it bit by bit or as a whole, with an extra of mixed, unclear morals. Its intent enters in conflict with what it did, but it at least looked and sounded good. I begin to wonder if this could've been tighter if it was 13 episodes long.\\n",

            "content": "Little Witch Academy is way too overrated. OVA and movies were good but this series is just weak compared to those.. plot is slow and filled with plotholes., most characters have only 1 aspect that describes them and episode endings and reveals are all very pretictable and cliche. \r\nAlso, episodes lack proper build up for their reveals (for example in 5th episode attack of dragons came out of nowhere, main dragon being harmless buisnessman came out of nowhere, school being in debt and owning money to dragon came out of nowhere, debt being scam came out of nowhere, Diana knowing ancient dragonese came out ofnowhere.. pretty much whole episode came out of blue). Lack of build up means that viewer can't really guess where story is heading and thus can't fully experience story of this series. After seeing 1 or 2 episodes of random surprises, this gimmick can't really carry story forward. \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, because it is episodic series then that means that stories are usually self contained and thus  solving plotholes should be done before the episode or during the episode. Otherwise we already have moved to different storyarc and plothole solving of previous arc after it has already resolved feels out of place. Currently there is almost no overarching storyline where time of solving plotholes doesn't matter.  Unlike Mob Psycho 100 there doesn't seem to be bigger arc toward what episodic series is building it's story and thus story of this series seems to be quite weak.\\n\\n\r\nIf we didn't had legendary OVA then this series would be considered avarage at best. 6th episode was more logical storyline than in previous episodes and because of that this series might get better in later episodes.. although start of this series is still way too weak.",

            "content": "Watching Little Witch Academia is like looking back into a portal to my youth. A time when Cartoon Network ruled the world! While I was born at the tail end of the nineties, and thus didn't experience what many people consider to be the golden age for the network, I did grow up watching re-runs of many of the shows that established the network and what made it so infamous during the early 2000s. Shows like Johnny Bravo, The Powerpuff Girls, Dexter's Laboratory and a plethora of others quickly became my favourite cartoons, and I still love them to this day, looking back on eachwith found feelings of nostalgia. Little Witch Academia evokes these similar feelings in me of nostalgia, and it's a sort of feeling that I honestly find hard to properly articulate since it is so raw and personal. The anime genuinely feels that it could have aired on Cartoon Network considering how fun, charismatic, and full of energy the entire show actually is, and with each passing episode, Little Witch Academia becomes even more charming and lovable, so much so, that this anime has become a personal favourite of mine! Through its wonderfully creative world, diverse and interesting cast, and bouncy animation, Little Witch Academia is easily the most fun I've had with a piece of media in a very long time, and despite some flaws in terms in its narrative, the entire show, in my eyes, is a wonderful representation of what can be accomplished in animation. With that all said and done, let's dive into why I believe this show to be as great as I proclaim it is!\\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia is set in a world in which the use of magic is being used less as a viable means in everyday life, but, despite that, there are still a plethora of witches who wish to learn and study magic for themselves, keeping the world of magic alive. One such girl happens to be our main protagonist, Atsuko Kagari, or simply Akko, who, after seeing a live magic show by a witch named Shiny Chariot, inspires her to take up magic herself, with the ultimate goal of meeting her idol one day, and learning how to use magic in order to put smiles on people's faces and help them forget about their troubles and grief. However, there is only one problem. Akko is totally inept when it comes to magic, having come from a family with no lineage of witches, and performing terribly in her classes at school when it comes to magic participation. She can't ride a broom while everyone else can, finds basic spells difficult while messing up everything she attempts to do while dragging everyone else into her mishaps and incidents. While we do learn the reason why Akko is so incompetent when it comes to magic in the twenty seconded episode, resulting in a great emotional plot twist, Akko's lack of ability and lack of knowledge for the magical world, in general, helps make her more relatable for an audience watching. She assumes the underdog role for this tale, and there is a general sense of cathartic pay off seeing her succeed in her magic studies and spells when others doubt her or assume she will never succeed, yet still proves them wrong. Much like how the audience doesn't know anything about this world, nor does Akko, and this allows the audience to experience the world through her eyes. As Akko learns and grows in this world, the audience does too, which helps the audience grow more attached to Akko as a person. It's the same emotions evoked in watching someone try their hardest and then eventually succeeding after hard work that makes the series incredibly addictive to watch, at least for me anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, back to the plot, as Akko attempts to get to Luna Nova for her first day of school, she finds it impossible to get there since a broom is needed to go through a magical road, but she meets a girl called Lotte, who becomes a good friend of Akko, who then gives her a ride to the school. However, whilst travelling in this magical road, they are thrown off course and are transported into another area, where they meet up with Sucy, whom will become another friend of Akko's. They're attacked by strange creatures, Akko finds Chariot's Shiny Rod, saves the day by enchanting a magic word, and makes it to the school just in time. The next few episodes sees Akko and her friends attending school will many different magical problems ensue, but the series begins to introduce a more central and focused narrative with Akko attempting to find seven magic words that she believes will bring her closer to Shiny Chariot, which will also activate the Grand Triskelion. A powerful magic that has the power of reconstruction, but, for the most part, the series is fairly episodic, which can be used as a critique against the show. However, each episode has enough energy and charisma, as well as variety to keep things fun and never felt boring and repetitive. From a race on broomsticks to reviving a skeleton, to building a giant ship that turns into a giant robot reminiscent of Gurren Laggen, the entire series uses its magical world in neat and creative ways, making the show an absolute blast to watch. Since anything is possible in a world full of magic, the show remains incredibly addicting to watch since we never know what the show may bring to the table next and each scenario the characters find themselves in is fun as all hell, and the character interactions never fail to put a smile on my face. The world of Little Witch Academia feels alive and vibrant, with so many things to discover and find intrigue in. One thing in particular that I always found interesting was Akko's journey to find the words needed to meet Shiny Chariot. As she searched for each one, she always ran into interesting witches of the past and discovered several past secrets about the world of magic. There is a lot of care put into its world-building elements and each one feels extremely memorable. Each event and scenario is tangential to this main idea of Akko growing, not only as a witch in regards to her improving her magical abilities, but also as a person too, and each one of the words, and their meanings parallels this growth as well.  \\n\\n\r\nAs the show moves into a more central narrative and introduces a villain for the show, the story is filled with much more emotional depth and is genuinely heartwarming in a lot of places too. One of the most interesting themes the show presents is the idea of old customs, such as magic, slowly being less needed in the world as it becomes more developed and technologically advanced. This theme of technology versus magic is integrated well, as if it was an issue in our very own world, and is explored in interesting ways to aid character development, especially in regards to Diana's characters, in which one of her arcs as a character is focused on her wanting to continue the proud lineage of her family, which is becoming increasingly difficult to do in this ever-changing world. Another example where this element is done especially well is the relationship that builds between Andrew and Akko after Akko sneaks into his party, where many upper-class witches and people gathered. Andrew, being incredibly sceptical of the world and potentials of magic, and Akko, being the loud person that she is when projecting her love for magic, initially clash upon their first meeting, but as the show goes along, Andrew warms up to Akko, and, in turn, the world of magic as well, and begins to slowly appreciate its potential use in society. This also results in some of my favourite movements in the show, seeing Akko and Andrew working together and their chemistry is genuinely great as well. Each episode is devoted to fleshing out a character or giving some them some time to shine, through the use of magic in creative ways. The comedy and character interactions feel organic and the show has such a wonderful charm about it that I found myself smiling a plethora of times, especially seeing Akko grow as a person. As the show goes along, Akko learns shapeshifting magic, allowing her to change into various different animals, all of which are fun and are used in smart ways, while also looking absolutely adorable, especially the mouse transformation.  This is perhaps best integrated in the twenty-first episode when Akko is rapidly changing between different animals whilst fighting against a large python.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I have praised the story of Little Witch Academia a lot, it's still without its problems. For starters, the plot can feel a little too convenient at times, such as in the very first episode where Akko just so happens to come across Shiny Chariot's rod while in a forest and some of the moments can feel too silly or contrived for my liking, such as when Akko comes across a super fast broom that is legendary in the world of magic, in a simple magic shop rather than in a museum, or, better yet, in Nuva Lova itself. However, while there are a few of these issues, I never found it ever to be too intrusive on my immersion or enjoyment of the series nor is it necessarily a game breaker either. The episodic plot lines may be annoying to some people wanting an overarching story all the way through, but, as I said, I believe each episode to be fun and creative enough to stand by itself, so I had no problem in regards to this area. One plot line can feel a little too predictable if you ask me, but, again, is something that doesn't really take all too much away from the overall experience or narrative.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also pretty great too, with each one having a very distinct personality that bounces off each other very well, especially in regards to the main trio, Akko, Sucy and Lotte. Akko is a character I've already talked about in detail, but her development and her character arc presented in episode twenty-two after learning something that changes her perception of her world are easily the best parts of the show, and seeing her grow into a more rounded person proves to be highly satisfying. She is a good lead for a show of this nature, taking into account her inquisitive nature, and she is often used for comedic, slapstick effect as well. While she can sometimes be a little too annoying in the early parts of the series, and some of her lines and dialogue and lines about dreams and passion can come across a little too corny as well, Akko's character is one that I wanted to see succeed; I became invested enough in her character to do so. Not only that, but she has a clearly defined goal in the series, which helps with plot progression as well as direction.\\n\\n\r\nLotte and Sucy are two of Akko's personal close friends who share one room together, and, as the series progresses, begin to bond closer to one another too. Lotte is much simpler than the other characters, both in design and personality, as she is perhaps the most down to Earth and calmest of the bunch. She plays the typical nerdy sort of character, and while she does receive some development, she is kind of pushed out from the forefront in favour of Akko. She has her moments but is far from being one of my favourite characters. Sucy, on the other hand, is the best girl of all times. Her appearance alone can convey everything about her character, and her voice actress does an amazing job at enhancing it too. She is essentially a pessimistic mushroom magic user, who finds enjoyment in using Akko as an experimental guinea pig while laughing maniacally about it. However, in the eighth episode of the series, and one of the best in my eyes, Akko has to dive into Sucy's subconscious, and there she meets hundreds of different versions of Sucy, all of which have different personalities to that of the original, representing Sucy's repressed emotions. While in this world, Akko watches a bunch of movies, that are Sucy's memories, and we learn that one of Sucy's best moments comes from her first meeting with Akko, and the various adventures they had up to that point. It's a sweet moment and gives us more indication that Sucy does care about her deep down, than what we were lead to believe from the start. \\n\\n\r\nDiana's character also goes through a lot of development, as she begins to respect and grow fond of Akko more and more in response to Akko's improved magical abilities such as in episode thirteen, when Akko proves her magical capabilities in front of a massive audience while taking on, and even helping, a large, cursed creature. While Diana, in the early parts of the series is stuck-up and pretty bitchy, she becomes more bearable and likeable as the episodes come along, especially over the course of her own respective story arc in the nineteenth and twentieth episodes, which I touched on briefly before, but also in episode twenty-three when she is talking to Akko in a cafe and opens up her own childhood love of Shiny Chariot as well. It explains why her character acts and behaves the way she does and also adds deeper insight and depth to her as a person too. Andrew's character too, as I've touched upon too, also develops in the scene that he comes to understand and appreciate the world of magic a bit more, but his character is also a gateway to understanding the rest of the world's stance of how magic is used in the modern era, and, I've said, I really liked the relationship formed him and Akko. While it is nothing romantic, there are slight hints of it here and there, but it never comes to any surface level or feels too intrusive on the more interesting aspects of the show.  \\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly, the crux of the show and its narrative weight is the relationship between Akko and Ursula-sensei, and while I won't get too much into the specifics why and what this entails, since I want to avoid spoilers as much as possible in this review, just note that this is the one that forms the backbone for the series to rest upon. The other members of the cast are also very fun to watch as well, whether that be the various teachers with their odd eccentricities, such as professor Lukic, a mad potions teacher who lines never failed to make me laugh. One of my favourites of the side characters was Constanze, who doesn't even utter a single word yet we can understand what she is thinking just from her body language and facial expressions alone. We don't really learn or understand why she doesn't speak in the series, but she allows us to understand that the world of magic is not all about wands, but also machinery, as she seems to merge both technology and magic together, adding onto the theme I was talking about earlier. She also has my favourite episode in the show in which she builds a giant ship that transforms into a robot, which is an obvious homage to Gurren Laggan, typical of Studio Trigger. Also, that little smile that Constanze delivers the end of the episode after being thanked by Akko is wonderfully adorable. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, this is probably the best (and most consistent) show that Trigger has made thus far. The animation is very bouncy, with lots of energy and pull and stretch for that cartoon-y esque feel. It genuinely feels that, while not as polished, it could be a show that someone like Disney would create, in regards to how colourful, creative and fun everything is. It's character designs are great and can tell you everything about the character's personality just from a glance and it can sometimes showcase some absolutely fantastic animation. However, there are some art issues here and there, but, for the most part, the animation is so bouncy that it doesn't really affect the show all too much. The music is also pretty damn good with two amazing opening tracks, \"Shiny Ray\" and \"MIND CONDUCTOR\". I especially love the opening animation to MIND CONDUCTOR too, and the music used in the show itself is also great, especially the main theme. It is catchy, memorable and damn well composed, adding onto the more heartfelt and emotional moments the anime attempts to convey.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can't yet tell from my relentless praise, I love this show. It is a wonderful reminder of why I love animation as a whole and the entire show has such an innocent, child-like wonder about it as well. From its wonderful characters, great narrative and creative world, this show ticks all the boxes for me personally in terms of what a show should have, and I do highly recommend this anime, as well as the two movies that came before it as well. Little Witch Academia has the luxury of being an original show, and thus also has one of the most satisfying conclusions I've seen in a long time, which only further cemented this anime as one of my favourites of all time. Everything about this show has a genuine sense of, well, genuineness about it, and it feels like the team behind it put their all into making it, and had a blast while doing so, which is all I can really ask for at the end of the day. With that, I thank you for reading my review, and I wish you all a great day!\\n",

            "content": "A small preamble - in my opinion \"Little Witch Academia\" already deserves praise for being an anime deviating from the norm, a piece of art that indicates hope for the revitalization of the whole anime industry. And even more so, if we keep in mind that the original story (short film) was released 2013 as part of the 'Young Animator Training Project's Anime Mirai' project, its second movie was entirely realized due to crowd funding, both attempting to showcase an exceptional, magical fairy tale of a young girl, striving to become a great witch. \r\n_____________________________________________\r\nRight from the start, the viewer is instantly drawn into aworld of traditional fantasy and folklore, where magic is not just a simple word, but an essential part of life and the entire world (building).\\n\\n\r\nStory - \"Little Witch Academia\" follows a trio of girls, Akko and her friends, Lotte and Sucy, as they experience many magical adventures together. Akko has a big dream, therefore she decided to enroll in the 'Luna Nova Magical Academy' to become a great witch like her idol Shiny Chariot, whom most people in Luna Nova Academy consider a fraud. The story follows the daily struggle of the trio, whereas Akko has to deal with even more difficulties due to her non-magical background as a first generation witch from Japan. Still, that never stops her from being energetic and cheerful, while overcoming the hardships of a witch (pupil) with her two besties.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is by no means bad, I'd rather say the monster and character design is eye-catching in a good way, especially with respect to the portrayal of the environment and beautiful background scenery. And even if one minds the slight 'simplicity' of the art every now and then, you should come to acknowledge that it perfectly fits the fantasy style of the anime in its entirety, expressing its own charm.\\n\\n\r\nAnother positive fact is that the anime completely manages without the heavy use and usual inclusion of romance, or other common themes - to gloss over a lack of creativeness and imagination - which we have already seen hundreds of times, over and over again. So if you're one of those people who are already tired of always seeing the same story-telling and generic stereotypes, you'll really come to love and appreciate \"Little Witch Academia\"'s unique way of telling an interesting adventure, including lively and versatile characters that are more than just simple decorations, which are often entirely overshadowed by the protagonist in other anime.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia unveils that every journey begins with a single step in the right direction, to realize one's own dreams and hopes, in one of the most heartwarming, funniest and enjoyable ways that you have ever seen - a truly rare gem. Furthermore, the anime delivers exactly what it promises, a light-hearted adventure in a fantasy world.\\n\\n\r\nTo cut a long story short, naturally, I'll refrain from giving a serious rating at this point of time, but if I have to express a vague direction I'd score the anime with a decent -8- at the moment, that scoring is also in regard to the prior movies as a justified basis, it will be changed appropriately in the end.",

            "content": "A magical world in Little Witch Academia is one I can describe as imaginatively beautiful. Beauty is expressed there not just by world fiction but by the context of its creativity. I don\u2019t mean just the world either but the show itself is filled with characters, themes, and storytelling that make you want to go back and watch it all over again. \r\nLittle Witch Academia is perhaps unique with the fact that it\u2019s an adaptation of a successful film. The first film originated in 2012 as part of the Young Animator Training Project and spawned a sequel titled Little Witch Academia: The Enchanted Parade. Now,we have a full TV series based on the franchise that all began from the creativity of those animators. Watching Little Witch Academia is pretty simple with an open mind especially if you\u2019re a fan of magical girl theme series. It has the characters that makes the storytelling feel special, a world with seemingly endless possibilities, and moments that will be unforgettable. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the first few episodes, we are introduced to the world that shows its content by events and story rather than a dull dialogues. School life at Luna Nova is also shown in details as we see how Akko, the main female protagonist lives her daily life. Of course, Luna Nova is no ordinary school and in fact contains lots of secrets that defies the law of nature. From here, you\u2019ll find witches, magical creatures, spellbooks, and iconic flying broomsticks. The storytelling connects to the history of the school with its characters as well so from in it, viewers will learn the origins of the world. What I find impressive is how this series continuously build on its world setting with every episode that makes you want to find out more and more.\\n\\n\r\nAt the centerpiece of the story is Akko. She\u2019s a young girl who has grew up to admire Shiny Chariot, a famous witch performer. This inspired Akko to actually attend Luna Nova and in essence, she hope to meet Shiny Chariot one day in person. While she\u2019s there, Akko also makes friends and rivals. Along her side, she is good friends with Lotte, a friendly girl with a talent of summoning spells. Then, there\u2019s Sucy the mischievous girl with a talent of potion making and causing bizarre incidents. These three characters all have different personalities but manages to get along as they learn more about each other. The character chemistry between the three evolves throughout the show although it doesn\u2019t exceed expectations. For instance, Lotte and Sucy gets less screen time later on as the plot evolves into much more complex twists and turns. Akko\u2019s growth as a character is what this show focuses on the most. From the start, she\u2019s a talentless witch and known for causing trouble. These often result in unintentional hazards but nonetheless, Akko is viewed as a fool by many of her professors and classmates in the beginning. Most interestingly though, Akko is able to wield the Shiny Rod, a staff that previously belonged to Chariot herself. In the meantime, there\u2019s also Diana, a character that stands as a foil to Akko. Unlike her, Diana is talented, comes from a prestigious family, and is respected by many of her classmates and professors. Her philosophy of magic also contrasts with Akko and in turn, she serves more or less as a rival; although this seemingly comes from Akko\u2019s point of view. As the series progresses, we can see that Diana is both impressed and surprised by Akko\u2019s feats in certain magic from certain episodes. In retrospect, character relationship in this show between friends and rivals evolves for fans to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the series itself contains a lot of goofy moments, it does have a serious side. The first half of the show involves mainly of how Akko and her friends gets used to academy life while the second half concentrates more on plot with the series getting more in-depth with its characters. One of the more noticeable character in the series is Ursula, a friendly professor that takes Akko under her wing. The two has a close relationship and Ursula realizes Akko\u2019s strong desire to become a witch. Furthermore, Akko and Ursula holds a similar belief in magic and it\u2019s from their philosophy that we can see how close they become. Now you may be questioning yourself: what about antagonists? Are there real threats that comes to surface against the main characters? To answer that, it\u2019s more about how the characters deals with them rather than just resolving certain conflicts. I can say honestly that the show is much more appealing when you invest into the character motivations and realize why characters do certain things. As such, Little Witch Academia isn\u2019t a magical girl show that\u2019s about saving the world from evil but rather much more focused on character building and realization. \\n\\n\r\nAs much as creative as Little Witch Academia seems to be, you may not be too impressed if you\u2019ve seen a lot of magical girl theme shows before. Magical schools is hardly a hot new theme as many series have done it before. Furthermore, our main character Akko can be frustrating to watch at times. Sure, she is fun to watch and brings a lot of comedy into the show. However, she is still considered one of the most talentless witches at the school and it\u2019s frustrating at times to see her fail in certain subjects. I can confess that sometimes, I wish she would just get it right the first time. Other characters in the show such as Amanda excels in certain areas that makes her look like an idiot at times too. This show does teach a valuable lesson though and is that hard work can have its own rewards and consequences.\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of studio Trigger, my expectations were definitely met with the production quality. It\u2019s goofy, cartoony, yet visually appealing that captures the magic of this series together. Characters\u2019 personalities matches with their appearances and everything seems to be in place according to its world fiction. Nova Luna is also designed in the way that I\u2019d picture it would be and like in the movies, it expands much more than just what it appears. Character expressions are also crafted in ways that look humorous especially for cases such as Akko and Sucy. I mean, who can forget when Akko transforms into an adorable mouse and running around at school? On the action side, the show does a neat job with formulating magic and showing how spells work beyond than words. \\n\\n\r\nI have to give some praise to the voice actors. Akko\u2019s voice sounds exactly how I would imagine with her impulsiveness and eager to succeed. On the other hand, I\u2019m also impressed by Diana\u2019s voice of confidence that makes her character status believable. Sucy is also noticeable for her meek yet mischievous voice tone that fits her personality perfectly. The OP and ED theme songs are also done with colorful choreography. While I can\u2019t say the OST is anything to take home, it\u2019s still serviceable to get the job done.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia is a beautifully crafted show that brings magic to a level that\u2019s larger than life. With a graceful cast of characters, memorable moments, creative storytelling, and imaginative world, it\u2019s definitely worth getting invested into. Even if you\u2019ve never seen the films or a magical girl show in your life, it\u2019s still a show that I can recommend for some wild and vivid fun. It hits the right numbers in many areas for what a magical girl show should be.\\n",

            "content": "Before I being, let me say this. I am very grateful to Tattun the producer, for visiting 4chan during the time LWA aired. Many fans, myself included, had the opportunity to ask him a bunch of questions, and learn a few interesting things about the story and characters. So in the unlikely chance you\u2019re reading this, Thank you buddy!\r\nLittle Witch Academia\u2019 (depending on viewers\u2019 opinion) can be summed up as either \u201ca charming, adventurous title; full of unique characters, interesting storylines, and filled with fun & entertainment.\u201d  On the other hand, it can be summed up as a disappointing, overly self-referential, lackluster title;full of too many western references, terrible pacing, filler, shoehorned, and plain one-dimensional characters.\\n\\n\r\nInside the magical, heartwarming tale of Little Witch Academia, we follow our annoying (but loveable\u2026 admit it!) protagonist Atsuko \u201cAkko\u201d Kagari. Akko is human with the burning passion of becoming a great witch like her idol Shiny Chariot! Watching the story unfold is one that viewers will certainly enjoy watching. Perhaps one of the most enjoyable things about little witch academia\u2019s story is that it provides multiple re-occurring themes that fit well with the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe best one that is shown over and over throughout the series is ambition. Many of the women enrolled at Luna Nova academy show determination, and work hard to achieve their personal goals. Akko of course has to work the hardest because she has no talent. It feels like such an accomplishment to witness Akko and the others achieving their goals! I felt like that was the biggest payoff the story had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nI was skeptical during the first 6 episodes; the content provided had failed to meet my expectations. In comparison to the OVA and movie, the quality of the TV anime appeared a bit more childish. The plot for each episode was overly simplified, coupled with terrible pacing. It was so bad that I felt like I was watching a children\u2019s show.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to studio triggers other titles, the content provided in LWAs\u2019 story is tame. You won\u2019t find over the top violence, blood and gore, overly sexualized characters, and other mature themes that you would usually see in a Trigger anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe transition from mature content to child-friendly was a little disappointing, and hard for me to get used to. But, after giving it some time, I got used to it. I must admit that Little Witch Academia\u2019s story is fine as it is, childish and all. Some of the best episodes provide viewers with interesting narratives, humorous content, a wee bit of romance, and finally thrilling action. The lackluster episodes are almost filler like, with unnecessary and unwanted subplots, which do not add anything further to the story. In short, the subplots ruin the pacing of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe middle of the series, the rising action, and the events leading to the climax of little witch academia was very disappointing. The pacing and action leading up to it was awful! It kills the hype that the show had previously had. It felt as if writers and director just wanted to rush into something bigger, as seen in episode 24. The writers ended whatever evil plot the antagonist had earlier, just to create another conflict which would have the Akko and friends defeat it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSupporting characters in the story?\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters that are not Ursula-sensei, lose their value towards the rising action. During the last four or five episodes; Sucy, Lotte, and Amanda\u2018s crew, are demoted to background characters, and get at least 10 minutes (if even that) of screen time. It isn\u2019t until last three episodes that we see the supporting characters comeback however; they\u2019re basically around just to cheer Akko as well as give her help when needed.\\n\\n\r\nThe 25 episodes of little witch academia were generally good, and at times decent. While I was not impressed with the pacing and filler; I did enjoy the sweet and tender parts the show had to offer. I gave the story and 7 and a half out of 10 because I felt that even though the show was good, it still had a bunch of glaring problems and wasted potential.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nI feel bad that there isn\u2019t much that I truly enjoyed about the supporting characters other than Ursula.\\n\\n\r\nI felt that Ursula was the only support that mattered because she helped the story progress. Diana would be a close second however; even she gets pushed to the side. Other than that, I felt that the characters were great. They were full of personality and fun to see on screen.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning I hated Akko. She\u2019s so one-dimensional. Not to mention she\u2019s annoyingly loud & dumb to the point where I just want to fast forward through every scene she is in. Despite this, Akko does have redeeming qualities to her; especially when her character starts to develop. In a weird way, she sort of reminds me of Naruto Uzumaki from the Naruto franchise. She\u2019s loud, annoying, and stupid. However, when she\u2019s determined to do something, she\u2019s willing to work hard, train, and never give up! It makes her fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, supporting characters lose all value (and to an extent) purpose. They\u2019re subjugated to being nothing more than background characters with little to no lines. I felt that, in exchange for an episode based upon a supporting character, they would have to lose their screen time in order for the story to focus more on Akko.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Visual direction/Sound\\n\\n\r\nCould have been better! I liked the designs; some of the settings were unique. The animation was okay. I wasn\u2019t impressed with it, I felt like some of the special effects were poor in quality. As far as the character designs go, I felt that they were great. I\u2019m honestly looking forward to the art book! WE WILL SUPPORT IT TATTUN!\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs were great; some of the background music was okay. I felt that some of the songs composed for this anime didn\u2019t quite fit well with the atmosphere & settings they took place in. Also, the music didn\u2019t do that good of a job bringing exciting moments to life.  The voice acting was great however, the audio quality sounds like they were using budget microphones in the studio. I listened to Little witch academia using \u201cBose quiet comfort 35\u201d headphones. I must admit, if you have a good pair of headphones or speakers, listen closely and you\u2019ll hear how bad the sound quality is. Especially during scenes where there are monologues.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall feelings.\\n\\n\r\nIs Little Witch Academia Academia a project Trigger should be proud of? I would say yes! It\u2019s different. It\u2019s something unique, I feel that it\u2019s one of those shows that could catch on, and sell well if marketed correctly. I strongly believe that LWA needs a push. It needs to branch out more to be successful. I\u2019m not saying that the series isn\u2019t, it\u2019s just that Trigger needs to make it stand out more. \\n\\n\r\nI felt that little witch academia was well worthy of an 8/10 and I would strongly recommend it!\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The magic is gone.\r\nThat may seem like a cutesy little Gene Shalit-esque pun to start off the review, but I mean it with all sincerity: the magic and charm of the original OVAs has, for the most part, vanished from its television adaptation. And as someone who adored the hell out of those OVAs, that's a goddamned shame.\r\nThis show has a clear two-half structure: the first was primarily character based, featuring episodic adventures to establish and flesh out the cast, while the second introduces the plot in full force. Now, some were unsatisfied with that first half, but I was willing to go along forthe ride. While there were some particularly weak episodes (gotta love Twilight pastiches in 2017, because that's relevant), some were quite enjoyable overall (episode 13 really comes matches some of the wonderment that characterized the first OVA), and that sense of fun carried me through.\\n\\n\r\nIt's when the plot kicks in that we run into trouble, because the plot... is stupid. Little Witch Academia is propelled entirely by an idiot plot, where things only happen because characters refuse to divulge critical information (Tell Akko not to trust Croix! She literally kidnapped Akko and tried to have you killed! Come on, at least give her a warning!) or characters are incapable of making the most simple of conclusions (Gee, I wonder if that evil magic robot that pushed Akko out of the tower and almost MURDERED her has anything to do with the ONE professor for tech magic who only showed up EXACTLY when this strike started and has tech that looks EXACTLY like that robot! Doesn\u2019t anyone else notice this? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!). Ursula has no excuse not to reveal her identity to Akko; whereas in the shorts, you could infer some personal history and perhaps shame, embarrassment, or regret colored her decision to lay low, the entire fate of the world apparently hangs in the balance now, but I guess it's better to keep everyone arbitrarily in the dark about details of paramount importance and hope everything works out for the best.\\n\\n\r\nStupid, and what moments aren't stupid are punctuated by an uninspired \"Hunt for the McGuffin\" plot that just seems entirely half-assed. \\n\\n\r\nCharacterization has also taken a noticeable hit. You see, I was hoping from Croix's juxtaposition against Diana in the second OP that while she might play an antagonistic role, she wouldn't be outright malicious, just somebody coming at this problem with a fundamentally different perspective, or maybe she'd have a personal schism with Chariot, and that the resolution of the plot would come after our characters could find some way to bridge these two sides...\\n\\n\r\nOh, wait, she's just moustache-twirlingly evil? Like a sidecutted knockoff of Snidely Whiplash? Gee wiz, for a second I was worried we might have an arc or something.\\n\\n\r\nThat's an even bigger disappointment considering what a good character Diana is. Part of what made LWA great was that, while Diana very easily could have been the stock-snotty bully, the shorts went to great lengths to show that she's ultimately well-intentioned, she just has a different perspective and attitude from Akko.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it's not like Trigger has completely forgotten what made LWA great; episode 13 is a standout moment, and captures the heart of the original two shorts. Unfortunately, that peak makes the contrast against its current lows all the more stark.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a lot to type up for a show about little girls training to become witches, and maybe I just hoped for too much, but I'm really let down. You can see the potential, but it's buried under an utterly bungled execution. My appreciation for the original shorts will likely keep me watching to the end on the off chance that something will fundamentally, radically change between then and now. However, if someone were to ask me if I think the show is worth their time, I would have to honestly tell them no. That hurts.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this, kids, is why you never wish on a monkey's paw.",

            "content": "This is my first review, I hope it's helpful! This review was written after 6 episodes have aired, on 2/18/2017. I will update this review as my thoughts on the series develop more thoroughly.\r\nTL;DR: The show so far has been pretty good so far, and I think people should give the show a chance. It's been episodic so far, so if you are a fan of episodic anime, you will probably enjoy this. If you aren't a fan of episodic anime, I definitely recommend you give the format a chance. I don't think Trigger will let you down come the end of the series, formore details read my full review.\\n\\n\r\nI think it is a little early to be giving this show any sort of long-term judgements. I think those with negative reviews should wait and see if the series gets better, and I think those with overly positive views should not be blind to the problems apparent so far with LWA. The viewer is given little to know where the plot is going, and depending on how the series deals with this and changes in the future, my opinion of this aspect could change. Right now, I think it detracts from the story, but maybe it won't when viewed as a whole. The animation isn't anything crazy, but in my opinion, it has a great art style, appealing aesthetic, and character design. The sound so far has not been exceptionally memorable, but the soundtrack definitely fits the feel of the series. I just feel like it's not very memorable because it's the exact kind of music you would expect from this kind of series. Besides the plot kind of going in not apparent direction, I'm overall really enjoying this series, and I think anyone can really enjoy this series if they can get used to the largely episodic format the series has taken on so far. I'm personally a fan of episodic anime (The Tatami Galaxy, Cowboy Bebop, Gintama, etc.), and I think if you are someone that is okay with the episodic format, you have the ability to really enjoy LWA. So far all of the episodes have given us fun adventures into the world of Luna Nova, and I think most of the episode plots have gone in really interesting and entertaining directions. Personally, I was hoping for something not as episodic from Trigger, like how they did with Kill la Kill, but I still have hopes that Little Witch Academia will get better and better as the season goes on.",

            "content": "Warning: There may be some spoilers here, I tried to clear all of them out of the way so there shouldn't be any. However, I don't know what one would or would not consider as a spoiler in corner cases.\r\nLittle Witch Academia is a show that wanted to have its cake and eat it too. It tried to do so much from Western Animation tropes and fluffy episodic episodes to a serious plot with the ramifications of the magic world up in the air. However that attempt to do so much is it's downfall as it ends up failing at each thing it tried. Whilethe art and animation were great as to be expected from Trigger, the actual writing under it was subpar and had a lot of problems. The biggest of which is: What is Little Witch Academia trying to do?\\n\\n\r\nIt starts off as an episodic show which very little that carries over from episode to episode. While there are hints of something important in the first episode they are mostly brushed aside to go with these episodic plots. And while one's mileage may vary on that, it leads to the first half of the show having a more Western Animation feel. Not only are there tropes ripped straight out of Western Animation, but the lack of solid progression of the characters and the story points towards this. However, in the middle of this Little Witch Academia brings up numerous subplots, including one big plot to drive the story. None of these are able to make a good impression, and even worse the plots don't fit together at all.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a grand words plot, which to me doesn't feel compelling. While I understand the reason for using those words I don't understand how one would be able to find out those words especially with the draconic language being so dead. How would one be able to find out the words? Furthermore is just knowing them enough or does it rely on strength of character? This is where the words plot falls apart for me. If knowing them is enough, it doesn't really matter what the character does and they would be better off just doing research. It makes for a lackluster story and could be done by anyone. That probably isn't the answer but if it is it points to an uncompelling narrative. If it's based on strength of character that means the rod can read that, and if the rod can read that, why does it need the words in the first place? The finding of the words feels useless when ultimately the rod should be able to tell the pure heart of its user.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's not the only problem. The other problem is Akko. Akko doesn't grow. At all. They even lampshade this late in the series. And while I like a good lampshade it fails to work when the thing being lampshaded is one of the key aspects of the plot. It's hard to take it seriously when the main character who is fixing everything is just as flat and flawed as she was in Episode 1. If the rod works off of strength of character, then what is it in Akko, a character will little character development, that resonated with the rod? In either case, the word plot doesn't work as a compelling narrative.\\n\\n\r\nNor does it really add much. While Chariot is one of the most developed characters the plot revolving around her isn't very interesting. Not to mention the plot doesn't do anything special. Despite teasing complex relations it never goes through on that. Whilethere was the chance to make the characters developed and interesting, they ended up falling back into flat cliche characters that fit exactly with what one would expect from their roles. \\n\\n\r\nWhile they had room to make the plot complex and show many different sides of an issue they elected not to do so. There were opportunities to flesh out Criox's character and give good reasons behind her motivations, and there was time to pay more attention to their dynamic, however rather than do that they made Criox completely and utterly evil. Everything she does is for her own gain, and whenever there is something wrong in the latter half it's always the fault of Criox. No matter what bad things happen in LWA somehow the root of that negative cause will be traced back to Croix. She is a cartoon villain except instead of LWA being a comedy, it's a more serious and magical story. The two don't fit together very well, as it's hard to take such an evil character seriously as a villain.\\n\\n\r\nTo make it worse Little Witch Academia can't commit. While the plot wasn't the best idea in the first place, they did have the time to be able to make it strong and shine. However instead of doing that they decided to split it up between all sorts of different subplots and episodic episodes, reducing the time that they had for the plot down to a point where it felt forced in and didn't resonate.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodic episodes weren't bad but they did lack a point. They were usually overstuffed with Western animation cliches to the point where there were moments that could have existed without them but instead had them shoved in for no good reason. In one particular episode, the start of it has Akko and friends getting caught doing something bad and as punishment, they have to study with a teacher on a weekend on the same day that Lotte has this convention that she really wants to go to. They sneak out and go to the convention, and then the fact that they snuck out was never brought up again until the very end of the episode. The trope of being forced to do something on an important day is very common in Western Animation, and its inclusion here isn't necessary as it's ignored for most of the episode. But because it's there it only murks up the episode with another cliche, that adds unnecessary and unrealised tension that distracts from the main focus of the episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe bigger problem with these episodes is that they don't develop the characters. Most of them focus on what the Character is already like or on comedy. That means while each episode can be entertaining they don't help the narrative as a whole. If Little Witch Academia was solely a collection of fun episodic episodes that wouldn't be that big of a problem. Even though they didn't hit anything big in them, it would be fine if isn't it wasn't designed to. And at the start, it felt like that's how it was. It was supposed to just be fun events that had happened. However it strives to do big things, and for those big things to work there needs to be developed. It's hard to take the plot seriously when the development of that plot is weak and cliche. It's hard to care about the characters in that plot when they aren't developed and are just flat archtypes. As these episodes rarely developed any other part of the show, and so even though Little Witch Academia had the space to fit together, it never actually worked because they never did so. Not only did the episodic episodes do a poor job of setting up the later plot heavy episodes but it also meant that switching the tone between the two would leave a stark difference between the two sides, possibly alienating the distinct styles of each side from each other.\\n\\n\r\nThat was not the only distraction. There were other uneventful plots such as Andrew's plot that ended up not going much of anywhere. His inclusion does not add much to the story, nor does it stand well on its own. Rather all it does is introduce another cliche subplot to take up space from the main plot which could have used the additional focus. Little Witch Academia did not need a love interest, nor did it need the another character's struggles to be present in the story, especially when that character's struggles are not focused on magic or the main themes of the work. His role also is played in the most cliche way possible played completely straight. He adds nothing new, and the show wouldn't be different at all without him. And yet he takes valuable episode space on his ultimately unimportant plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem is while the ideas aren't the worst they really don't work when put together. The plot-based elements aren't able to be explored nor do they have the intensity that they could have if they were focused on alone. Rather they feel more like afterthoughts that are shoved into the episodes. Often enough they don't even have enough time in those episodes and suffer from rushed pacing as well. They feel unnatural and with the exception of a couple of well-placed moments, they don't fit into the general tone of the show. Its the same with the episodic moments. They're fine on their own but the tone between the two parts don't fit together well. The episodic episodes are light and comedic, while the plot is more serious and important.\\n\\n\r\nI touched on the characters a bit and for good reason. The characters were a big problem in Little Witch Academia. Even though the characters did have moments of focus very few of them grew as characters. The characters were mostly the personalities that they established in their first appearances. They never seem to grow and they rarely get any depth. This is most critical is the case of Akko who is just as reckless and impatient as she was at the very start. Most of the characters follow this same pattern though. The best character they have is Diana who actually developed and showed more interesting sides to her outside of her know it all role. She is able to express the conflicting feelings between her interest in magic, as well as her interest in tradition and her family history. However, even her strong points are countered by the fact of just how talented she is. Even though she has the most interesting struggles of the show, she happens to be incredibly talented and respected to a degree that stretches believability. Outside of Chariot the rest of the characters aren't very developed and Chariot has the same problems with being too talented although not on the same scale as Diana. Overall the characters don't add much, as most are flat, and the more developed ones are overpowered.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd it's not like the character interactions save it either. While some characters like Akko and Diana have natural chemistry this isn't the case with most of them. Even though there are other friendship groups besides Akko's most of the attention focuses on Akko with whomever else the episode decides on. And while there are moments that bring Lotte and Sucy closer to Akko, they also barely even appear together after the second half. Their friendship also feels a bit forced as even though the show does say that Sucy cares about Akko it's hard to believe that considering how they generally treat each other. The combination of the weak characters and awful mess of a plot makes a crap filled wreck.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily for Little Witch Academia, it is very pretty. The art is very nice, and the animation is fluid and works really well. It's a nice feast for the eyes. It also does well at building and animating hype moments. But that's about it. It also has a good deal of references and sequences designed to draw the attention of the fans. While these are not bad in nature, when they are inserted into the more serious moments of the show, it does hurt the moment.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Little Witch Academia works for the eyes, it doesn't work on any other merit, and overall is a large undeveloped mess. If it wasn't for the nice Trigger style I'd call this one of the worst shows of the season. Actually, it still is. Unless you just want to tune out and watch nice visuals I suggest giving this a hard pass.",

            "content": "A believing heart is your magic \u2013 with Little Witch Academia, Trigger furnishes something so enchantingly brilliant in its simplicity and heartfelt resonance, executes every detail with the utmost bliss, and ultimatley drowns the viewer in a recurring feeling of wonder; unto the conclusion that a believing heart can amount to nothing more and nothing less than that certain thing we all hope for but can't quite materialize.\r\nI realized I was in for a treat as the first episode ended and I was already wholeheartedly immersed in the characters and lore, which is a fleetingly rare way to feel one episode into such an admittedlyaccessible and light-hearted series. I realized this anime was something special during the final scene of the third episode, as Akko looked on as a Shooting Star took flight, or so to speak. In the briefest of moments, Little Witch Academia gracefully painted the most beautiful picture of the essence of everything magic is, all the hopes and dreams it embodies, and all the unduly weight, whether ethical or relating to personal growth, it can hold in such a fantastical world. It achieved this without even a hint of dialogue, but that\u2019s not to say Little Witch is something pretentiously rooted in an aversion to exposition, it just knows when a visual narrative is better suited than a verbal one, and vice versa. I realized this anime was most assuredly going to be my favorite series to air in years during the twelveth episode, when Akko was shown a vision of Chariot's youth; full of relatable blunders and missteps, but also joy in the purest form. Akko saw herself resonating in the the tumults of her idol, and through this she understood the cost of her dream, but more than that, she began to question her dream. Was it even her dream at all, or just the willfull embrace of another's dream that she sought to grasp onto with all her might? I realized Little Witch Academia was something bordering on truly great during the sixteenth episode, as Akko trudged through a snowy night on her lonesome in a desperate bid to save her friends, but never without her relentlessly believing heart beckoning her on and on. Reckless, unabashedly silly and floundering as she is, Akko never abandons her heart. She questions herself, becomes enveloped by doubt in her own innate ability on a regular basis, and struggles with her self-identify alongside the overcast shadow of Shiny Chariot and her opulent brilliance. But what is adversity to the human spirit? (Cue the plethora of Gurren Lagann parallels).\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is full but never overly packed; Akko\u2019s compatriots all undergo their own trials and tribulations in a magical youth. Lotte blossoms into a confident aspiring witch from a timid and insecure young girl, whilst dealing with her own passions and dreams. Amanda grows from a delinquent to a warmer and more joyful person as Akko helps her battle against the price of perception. Andrew sheds the predeterminations of his upbringing to the tune of his own destiny. Diana, in particular, experiences a journey of personal growth rivaling Akko, literally and figuratively, as she grapples with the desire to fulfill everyone else\u2019s immaculate expectations for her future, against her own aspirations. But behind her fa\u00e7ade of flawlessness, Diana also struggles with pettiness and jealousy, which cleverly mirrors the main antagonist\u2019s own conflicted youth, yet she seeks to avoids a similar folly through the kindness of others and her own stoically altruistic tendencies.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia, simply put, has it all. Action, adventure, humour, tragedy. A captivating soundtrack befitting of the series's dynamic tone. Fantastical world building transpiring in the midst of a surprisingly relatable coming of age story. Hopes, the shadows they cast. Sorrow, and the malice it begets. Friendship, family, a penultimate story that delves into the potentially questionable integration of technology into our lives, and even a dash of romance. These various elements and directions all synthesize into a breathtaking typhoon of a final episode in which Trigger accomplishes everything that should have been acheived in the Kill La Kill finale, but wasn't, and unequivocally more, because while less ambitious in scope, Little Witch wondrously surpasses Kill La Kill in depth, and it does so on a much more profound level.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch attains a tremendous dichotomy between innocence and sin, and it does so without ever compromising its cheerful composition. This is something not seen often in the medium, or any television medium for that matter, as so many series tend to spiral down a path of ever-directionless developments in an attempt to double down on the seriousness they wish to hone in on. Fun characters and happy endings are so typically cast aside in favor of gratuitous darkness; and fun series are so typically averse to achieving realism in spite of their fantasy, almost too intimated at the daunting prospect of creating something timelessly relatable and enjoyable to even make an effort. Trigger shoot for the stars with Little Witch Academia, as they always do (to mixed results), and at last they reach their luminous destination after the wildest of rides.\\n\\n\r\nEvery motif and achievement in Little Witch can be translated to the real world upon equating what magic represents, to what the human spirit is and can be. Romanticized as it may be, the human spirit is infinite and life is geniunely whatever you make it. Little Witch articulates this through the hopes and dreams of its characters and how they relate to the convictions within their hearts. A person's actions can bely their hopes and dreams, but that is not to say hopes and dreams are so sedentary that they won't spring up when you least expect them to.\\n\\n\r\nYet, when all is said and done, Little Witch Academia doesn\u2019t achieve artistic excellence via all of the above. It does so much more ephemerally, it does so simply and with solace, it does so with marvel and intrigue, it does so with everything it is and everything it does and everything it can be. Little Witch Academia is mesmerizing because it transforms magic into a believing heart.\\n",

            "content": "\"Believing is your Magic\" ~ Little Witch Academia (2017)\r\nTL;DR: at the very end\r\nHas Trigger saved Anime one more time? what does mean to save Anime?\r\nmeanwhile other anime studios makes their generic money maker without taking any risk, there goes Trigger risking it all and making Jewels and Masterpieces that goes beyond your imagination, see? there is no need to use generic settings and overused troupes just to get gold from a goldmine. there is another big gold mine called \"imagination\" and this is how Little Witch Academia from Trigger, saves the anime one more time! want to know more? then bring up some popcorn andrelax, because Little Witch Academia is one hell of a ride with lot to offer to its watchers.\\n\\n\r\nWarning: if you are an OVA/Movie Fanboy that didn't like this series because they aren't like the OVA/Movie, then fuck off, because neither the OVA or the movie matters here, this is a 100% original anime from the hands of TRIGGER. also bewary of spoilers\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nohh were to Start? Little witch academia goes around Atsuko Kagari (AKA Akko) a girl that always cherished Magic from the bottom of her heart. her dream to become a Witch and spread happiness to the world started when she saw a Live magic show from \"Shiny Chariot\". with that on her mind, she decided to go to \"Luna Nova\" the magic school where Shiny Chariot assisted in order to become a powerful and incredible witch just as Shiny Chariot was, and maybe she could meet her Idol. sadly, there is one big problem Akko has, she isn't very good with magic, and for some reason is very difficult for her to use magic or even to fly on a broom. this way, she gets to meet Sucy and Lotte, 2 witches that helps her to reach Luna Nova, but on the attempt something happens and they fall over a pretty dangerous forest, and right here, starts the adventure of our favorite Witch: Akko\\n\\n\r\nAfter finding the Shiny Rod, and dealing with the dangers inside the dangerous forest, Ursula-sensei appears and tells Akko some magical words that Akko must cast in order to use the Shiny Rod and save their asses, teleporting everyone into Luna Nova (also falling in the middle of the ceremony) and that summarizes the introduction of this show\\n\\n\r\nit might become boring and frustrating after this point, because the very first episodes are mostly dedicated to slice of life, character development and character introductions (might be the reason why so many people gave up on this show, they basically didn't want Trigger to save Anime) but after a while, they get us into the main plot of the show, which is to restore magic with the power of the \"words\" that Akko must find and cast, Akko, and only Akko, because she was the one chosen to do the task. each single \"word\" has a major meaning to magic and the show itself, since most of them comes from the bottom of the heart, from that heart that stills believe in magic, that heart that won't give up no matter what, but Akko must find first the meaning of each single word in order to cast them, once that happens, the Shiny rod will shine and cast the most beautiful magic you're going to see, I'm pretty sure you don't want to lose such an marvelous watch like that\\n\\n\r\nas for how much this show has to offer, there are a lot of secrets that most of magic holds, and the witches itself. secrets that might make you happy, sad, hyped, Yay +100000000000 or Yay -100000000000, even references to other anime (Specially from Trigger itself)\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: \\n\\n\r\nfrom this point I think that people is retarded, I've seen a lot of people complaining because the animation sucks... are they blind? what anime did they watch? because the animation of this show is TRULY a WORK OF ART, there is almost no usage of CG animation, which makes it even better when it comes to animate huge things and action scenes with a lot of movement, or even scenes that are tranquil but the animation quality makes up for it to deliver a gorgeous experience and keeps you hooked into it while you have your mouth open wide as how beautiful it looks. completely refreshing and gorgeous, even the animation of the OP and ED are really well done and makes a good resonance with the Sound department. \\n\\n\r\nif what people criticizes here is by any means some derpy looking faces, then they should just jump off from a bridge, because how the hell will you expect to have good looking faces most of the time, while spending a lot of budget into great and beautiful scenes? or would they like to see no derpy faces while having bad choreography at action scenes or gorgeous scenes?\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nI didn't got attracted to the first OP and ED, yet they were quite good overall, but nothing compares to the second OP and ED that are simply beautiful with 2 excellent songs that hyped me even more (specially the Ending that is really beautiful, or in the Opening where Chariot and Croix appears as Akko and Diana faces against each other)\\n\\n\r\nthe whole cast of seiyuus on this anime did a great job (heartbreaking me of course) but I didn't find myself hating any character by their voice or anything like that, in fact, having one character just making some noises (Constanze) makes it really cute. and lets not forget about the soundtrack of the anime itself, it just not only makes a good resonance with the Art department, it delivers the feels it has to deliver to your ears, call it eargasm if you want. but the whole OST is lovely\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10:\\n\\n\r\noh boy, one of the biggest appeals of this show is their characters cast, it can have some generic characters, Like Amanda or Diana (the bully and the \"perfect\" in this case) but their development is really like REALLY great, and guess what? all that development greatness happens because of Akko's greatness and invincible will to believe in magic. just like Simon Believed in the Simon that believes in himself on TTGL, that kind of power, the power that made Simon a Man. its the same power that made Akko a great character that influences those that are around her, making them great characters in the progress. even more as we get to know about their past and reasons (for example Diana, Ursula and Akko) with a really heartbreaking connection that explains everything, that and how each single one of them supports Akko, its like they got \"Akkoided\" hahaha understand? \"Akkoided\", I know, I'm really bad at jokes\\n\\n\r\nlets not forget about Chumlee or that dude that looks a lot like that History channel show of \"Pawn Stars\" (mostly known in spanish memes as \"No lo s\u00e9 Rick Parece falso\")\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nafter losing my faith into anime with your typical seasonal generic garbage, and seeing how some great jewels gets underrated because they don't have anything like boobs bouncing or something like that. Little Witch Academia and Triggers delivers and my faith has been restored. Trigger has saved anime one more time with a gorgeous fantasy world of magic that is really appealing with a heart touching story that will make you believe in magic\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: \\n\\n\r\nI'm not implying that you will mostly likely love this show, that depends on you yourself, and no one else, not even my review. that belongs on your sole experience while watching this anime. if you like it, then welcome to the club, if you don't then just pass away. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Trigger saves anime, Witches earns the love of their watchers while showing off gorgeous animation, great characters, great soundtrack, original ideas, and the power of believing in magic\\n\\n\r\nI would like a second season now... please Trigger ;~;\\n\\n",

            "content": "Those who watched the movie shorts of Little Witch Academia and expect to get the TV series to expand upon them would be sadly disappointed. The series does not seem to have a canonical connection to the previous movie shorts but rather starts fresh so you're not missing out on anything.\r\nIn the series we follow the main character Atsuko Kagari's (Akko) daily mischief with her friends and roommates Sucy and Lotte. Akko is a normal girl, not born a witch thus isn't naturally able to use magic without properly taught. Akko dreams of becoming a great witch like her idol Shiny Chariot. This is atypical underdog character setup. A character you root for to overcome all odds and difficulties and ultimately achieving their dream. Sadly from the first few episodes you progressively feel less and less inclined to root for her because of how little she is willing to learn or develop. \\n\\n\r\nThe episodes follow a simple pattern of introducing a problem to be solved at the end of the episode. The problem usually caused by either Akko or Sucy or both dragging Lotte along with them. \\n\\n\r\nSucy is a questionable friend and would risk breaking any school rules to get what she wants. \\n\\n\r\nLotte is the third wheel of the group. Her contribution usually consist of ignored warnings to Akko or Sucy to stop or not do something stupid and against the rules. \\n\\n\r\nAkko is the protagonist and she fails miserably at being likable. She is rash and impatient and doesn't think things through which drags her friends or the people around her intro trouble (which she never bothers apologizing for) she caused which most of the time is of serious nature (like raising the dead) but this show, being aimed at young teens nobody would actually die or get seriously hurt. You'd expect a harsh punishment for such misuse of magic and defying the authorities and the school rules but Akko and her friends are laid off with a less sever punishment because expelling them would mean the end of the show. This is where show falls flat as it uses that as an excuse for Akko or Sucy to do any kind of mischief as they desire without any real consequences.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is enjoyable for its art and quirky tone and simple plot of longing for the golden age of magic but the main characters fall flat as merely actors for the current episode rather than contentiously developing even if little episode by episode. There is never fear for anything to seriously dampen the mode not even as little as a fight or disagreement between friends.",

In order to accomplish her dreams, she enrols in Luna Nova, an wizard academy to where her idol went and one of the most prestigios.\r\nStory: Trigger follows its Kill la Kill formula with a first part that's mostly episodic, rarely moving the plot forwards, and with a basic objective the MC has to follow. KlK, nonetheless, executed it better. LWA tried to build around its characters with some very successful episodes and other somewhat boring, \"fillerish\". However, when the second part kicksin, it does with full force and it payoffs greatly.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound: Trigger does what it does best, with some breathtaking backgrounds and a great soundtrack. The way it plays homage to other animations styles is beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Much like the plot, characters at first may seem annoying, specially Akko, since she often tries to do things her way. Nonetheless it is easy to get attached to her, specially near the end of the anime. The rest of the cast is enjoyable, with girls like Sucy and Amanda that introduce a lot of fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a very fun anime full of awe and magic. Little Witch Academia keeps the \"Trigger saved anime\" meme on and I hope this isn't the end of the story of Luna Nova.",

            "content": "1966: Mitseteru Yokoyama, inspired by the Japanese popularity of the US sitcom \u2018Bewitched\u2019, created a little Anime called \u2018Sally the Witch\u2019 about a young girl from a magical kingdom who came to earth and used her magic to help with the troubles of the world. This now sadly obscure title would go on to be highly influential in leading to the creation of the \u2018Cute Witch\u2019 genre, which would go on to be a subgenre for a much larger genre, the \u2018Magical Girl\u2019 genre.\r\n1969: \u2018Secrets of Akko-chan\u2019 would expand upon the Magical Girl genre by introducing elements such as shapeshifting, and instead of involving agirl born with magic, involving an ordinary, relatable human character who attains such abilities.\\n\r\n1970: Osamu Tezuka\u2019s \u2018Marvellous Melmo\u2019 further expanded the realms of the genre, intending it for an older generation of young girls than previous titles in the genre had been by implementing the mature themes of other Tezuka works.\\n\r\n1973: The most revolutionary title of its time, \u2018Cutey Honey\u2019 introduced concepts such as the Magical Warrior Girl, an influence of American Superhero comics. It also introduced the transformation sequence which has since been a staple of the genre. Additonally, its provocative and unapologetic fanservice made it one of the few magical girl titles that appealed to men and women, as well as one of the first aimed specifically towards an adult audience which would mould into the growing Otaku fan culture.\\n\r\n1975: \u2018Meg the Witch Girl\u2019 introduced the dark magical girl genre with a series  involving domestic violence, substance abuse, extramarital relationships, and a politically charged mythos which introduced the Queen/Conquest element to the genre.\\n\r\n1980s: A decade in which Studio Pierrot effectively dominated the genre saw an increased focus on commercialisation to the now established Otaku subculture, as well as an increased focus on Magical Girl team dynamics.\\n\r\n1992: Naoko Takeuchi\u2019s Genre defining \u2018Sailor Moon\u2019 became the first  Magical Girl series to really break through into the West, becoming by far the most popular entry in the genre, and making the Magical Warrior the definitive face of Magical Girls. A series which embraced each trope of the genre (messages of love and hope, cute animal sidekicks, aimed towards a primarily female audience, elements which could be considered more Sci-Fi than Fantasy) to influence the likes of \u2018Precure\u2019 and \u2018Wedding Peach\u2019, but also had a compelling mythos and likeable cast of characters which causes it to still resonate with many to this day in a way that previous entries in the genre had not.\\n\r\n1998: \u2018Cardcaptor Sakura\u2019, the most minimalist and subversive entry in the genre up to that point bridged the gap between \u2018Cute Witches\u2019 and \u2018Magical Warriors\u2019 by including aspects of both genres, as well as mixing in Slice of Life elements.\\n\r\n2003: A 3 episode OVA remake of \u2018Cutey Honey\u2019 co-produced between Toei and Gainax saw a more self-aware, stylized interpretation of the genre, which was particularly notable due to its outlandish, fast-paced animation style which in part can be attributed to the Key Animation of Hiroyuki Imaishi who would go on to direct \u2018Gurren Lagann\u2019, and of course found Studio Trigger with fellow Gainax key-animator You Yoshinari who held much of the same kinetic animation style.\\n\r\n2011: Following a decade of increased evaluation on the genre in titles such as 2002\u2019s \u2018Princess Tutu\u2019 and \u2018Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha\u2019 which branched out beyond the trappings of the genre, perhaps the most well-known subversion to the genre came with Gen Urobuchi\u2019s \u2018Puella Magi Madoka Magica\u2019, an extremely dark, psychological Magical Girl series which looked  at the traumatic side of being a Magical Warrior. This anime would prove to have an enduring popularity which resulted in an increased market of Dark Magical Girl series such as the \u2018Wixoss\u2019 franchise and \u2018Magical Girl Raising Project\u2019\\n\r\n2013: In the midst of this backdrop of dark series came Studio Trigger\u2019s crowdfunded debut feature, a 25 minute OVA titled \u2018Little Witch Academia\u2019, a \u2018Cute Witch\u2019 piece which endeared to a large audience with its likeable cast of characters, establishment of story threads which set up for potential continuations, and the Imaishi inspired high-energy and inventive animation style that would go on to define  Trigger\u2019s other works. It\u2019s popularity of course then launched a sequel OVA, and a television series. The LWA project has resultantly become Trigger\u2019s primary selling franchise, similar to Type Moon adaptations for Ufotable, or \u2018One Piece\u2019 for Toei.\\n\r\nFall 2016: A new subversion to the genre came in \u2018Flip Flappers\u2019 where rather than darkness, abstract surrealism which from a superficial perspective provide entertaining eye candy, and from an analytical perspective provides an intellectually stimulating observation on art and philosophy. Neither interpretation is wrong, but for the purposes of this review I will say it\u2019s enjoyability is more relevant, as the series presented an alternative to series like \u2018Magical Girl Raising Project\u2019 the same season through its upbeat happiness.\\n\r\n2017: Coming immediately off the heels of \u2018Flip Flappers\u2019, the \u2018Little Witch Academia\u2019 tv series can be seen a confirmative shift away from the seemingly overpowering influx of darker Magical Girl series as of late with the series\u2019 positive and upbeat attitude. Whereas \u2018Flip Flappers\u2019 had an abstract nature which caused it to go outside the Magical Girl genre however, \u2018LWA\u2019 is a Magical Girl series through and through, and is proud of that fact.\\n\\n\r\nOk, I apologise for that extremely long intro, but I decided to make that to service the point that I wish to make in this review. The simple version of it is that \u2018LWA\u2019s appeal stems from it being fun. The greater version of it is that there is more to it than simply \u201cfun\u201d, or that the \u201cfun\u201d of it holds an even higher emotional resonance for its audience. That it expertly creates a work of escapist fantasy which is exactly what the average anime fan is looking for, a goal which is reflected in its trademark Trigger style and expansion of what was established in the two OVAs.\\n\r\nTo gain a proper understanding of the series, one should certainly watch the two OVAs before giving the tv series a shot, as although it does begin at a point chronologically before them, there are multiple references and call-backs to them which require prior knowledge. As a magical girl series, \u2018LWA\u2019 feels very much like a reconstruction of the genre, with a premise which takes it back to its roots in the concept of \u2018Cute Witches doing Cute things\u2019, and while the witches in question certainly are cute, it also reverses that age-old concept in having Akko be an ordinary human who discovers the wonders of the witch world, as opposed to Sally who was a witch discovering humanity. This restoration, in addition to giving the series a unique place in a modern market dominated by the warrior subgenre, also allows for us, the audience, to experience this world through Akko\u2019s eyes.\\n\r\nAkko Karagi very much makes this series what it is, with her upbeat and excitable attitude matching the overall tone of the show fluently. Her desire to be achieve greatness in spite of her shortcomings and her stubborn nature and her relentless misdemeanour makes her a compelling and greatly relatable character who in equal parts is able to provide moments of comedic relief and incredible sympathy. Of course, this is all stuff we\u2019ve before in the OVA, but what is unique to this series is the way in which her character grows and develops, as the timespan of 25 episodes allows for a large length of time for her development of her powers to feel authentic and realistic, while also slow enough that one can\u2019t help but cheer when she finally succeeds in using them in episode 13. Akko is essentially us, the audience, the Otaku. The way that she looks up to Chariot reflects how many of us look up to our favourite Anime characters and how she sees value in what is essentially intended as merely a piece of escapist entertainment in Chariot's performances.\\n\r\nThe other characters previously seen are great also, Lotte is still the wise and humble voice of reason in Akko\u2019s trio, Sucy, despite not going through any real development, does display her delightful eccentricities and hints that she cares more greatly for her friends than she is willing to openly admit. The greatest achievement of the cast however would have to Diana Cavendish, or Best Girl Diana, who goes through a significant development throughout the series. Many of us remember her from the OVAs as a snobbish and selfish antagonist to Akko, but the series highlights why she acts the way she does, as we learn more about her life and her personal situation. Although she seems stubborn towards Akko, she truly does care the wellbeing of the other students and like Akko hopes to prove herself. It is through her interactions with Akko that the quality of the writing shines brightest, as the success of Akko\u2019s brash actions initially alienate her, but eventually helps her, causing the two to grow a closer bond with one another and eventually developing something resembling a friendship when they learn that they have more in common than they initially believed, note the festival scene at the beginning where you may notice a certain someone.\\n\r\nWhen I described the series as \u2018escapist\u2019 earlier, I was referring to how it is able to embellish such a feeling of positivity in the viewer. This is reflected in many ways throughout the series, one such way is in how its world is presented. The series is split into two halves, with the first being an episodic, largely character and comedy driven series focusing more on character development than story progression, while the second half is more plot driven. While story elements such as Akko\u2019s quest for the seven words to restore magic to the world and find her hero, Shiny Chariot, permeates through the whole series, the amount of time we have allows the writers to present a fully fleshed out world. This is particularly noticeable when we see the ordinary world where technology has largely replaced magic, and the conflict this presents to Luna Nova Academy. The concept of Magic becoming obsolete by way of technology is one that I can\u2019t think of having been done in any other work of fiction before, so it is an interesting direction to take, bringing to the forefront the theme of traditionalism vs modernity, which we are able to view the multiple facets of, whether they be the stern and traditionalist attitudes of the Luna Nova elite, or the prejudiced attitudes of the modern world. The series never tries to take a side, as our main character opts for a middle ground in this conflict, though the series even confronts itself on that front when the main villain, Croix, takes such a position (seemingly, at least).\\n\r\nThis applies to one of the key themes of \u2018LWA\u2019, the idea that nothing exists in absolute terms. Sticking to the ways of old are clearly not working out entirely well for the Academy, but the negatives of life in the outside world are also emphasised, with many obvious references to real world political events such as football riots, racism, and the epidemic of internet trolling towards Yetis (and you thought this series was just \u201cfun\u201d). Yeah, I wasn\u2019t expecting to see stuff like that from this franchise. In case you\u2019re worried the series gets too political, you needn\u2019t worry as, in keeping with that theme, the story never allows one side of itself to completely take over, thus this aspect is left primarily as an interesting backdrop. It is also reflected in the tone of the series, and some of the criticisms that I have seen. The first half of the series received some criticism for lacking story progression in favour of humour, while to a lesser extent some have also criticised the second half for being overly serious. I respectfully disagree with these viewpoints, as I feel that while the second half did indeed give us dramatic moments (well executed ones at that), they never reached too overboard with it or tried to become too melodramatic. The first half meanwhile did still see some story progression, particularly in the excellent episode 6.\\n\r\nThis theme is once again examined in the characters, many of whom at first may appear to be unlikeable, but we grow to like them more as the series progresses and they are shown to have more dimensions to them. Dianna is the most obvious example of this, but in one scene we even see this change in her two sidekicks when they thank Akko for jmgjb cvvnjkhf (spoilers). The new character of Andrew Hanbridge, a male non-magical equivalent of Dianna who holds society prejudices towards witchcraft, believing it to be an outdated tradition, but eventually grows to respect them through his experience with Akko, whom he initially takes a disliking to, but comes to hold a certain admiration for. Or in the sterner leadership of Luna Nova\u2019s professor Finnelann, who ends up helping towards the climax. Even our main villain is shown to have a tragic and sympathetic backstory and is given a chance for redemption towards the end.\\n\r\nIf I must dispel with some negatives towards the series, I would say that while I wasn\u2019t as bothered by the series pacing as most people were, the episodic nature of the series did hurt it in some places, such as when we get an episode which is mostly filler gets in the way between some significant story progression. One example of this for me would be episode 5, which I found to be a rather dull episode, lacking the series\u2019 usual kinetic activity. Though I say mostly because even episodes such as this have something in them which does add to the series such as this episode being the one which introduced the technology conflict. Another thing is that being stretched across 25 episodes, the animation quality takes a significant downgrade from the OVAs, and can often feel a bit lacking in some areas. Finally, I would add that despite the length of the series, there are still some story elements which are left underdeveloped towards the end, such as the secret society of witch hunters from episode 18, or the fact that Lotte and Sucy, despite being Akko\u2019s closest friends and getting their own individual episodes, do end up taking a backseat in numerous incidents. Yoshinari has expressed interest in creating a second season, and it feels like some elements were left in the dark to serve as potential sequel bait, though considering the question of whether a second season will come to fruition it does feel like a bit of a shame that the series doesn\u2019t end on a conclusive note.\\n\r\nThat said though, the series we got was great. It was magical. Despite the animation taking a downgrade, it does still imbue Trigger\u2019s trademark energy throughout, displaying a brilliant mix of speed and visual cohesion in the displays of magic in the series, with the highlight being a fast-paced broom race in episode 3. It additionally features visual influences of Disney cartoons and 70s Shoujo series, as well as multiple references of other works such as \u2018Star Wars\u2019 and \u2018Evangelion\u2019 (this is a Trigger work after all). I am also a fan of the decision to have the second ED be computer animated to reflect the shift in focus towards technology.\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the magic also shines through in Michiru Oshima\u2019s soundtrack. The Main theme and its variants are always a delight to listen to, whether it is the triumphant, loud rendition which plays during some of the series more visually spectacular moments, the lowkey version played during some of the more laid back, comedic moments, or the slow and quiet rendition played in the series\u2019 more sombre and intimate moments. Being an Oshima soundtrack, it also incorporates elements of world influences, such as a Celtic track serving as the accompaniment of the series\u2019 deeper mythos (it has a legitimately interesting mythos btw) or a soft, winterlike piano melody which we alongside the \u2018search for Akko\u2019 scene late in the series, those who\u2019ve seen it know what I\u2019m referring to.\\n\r\nOne word that I don\u2019t think a lot of people will really bring to mind when thinking about this series is \u201cbalance\u201d, as people wouldn\u2019t normally associate high-octane Trigger-ism with that word. But I for one think that it does accurately describe \u2018LWA\u2019 as it\u2019s episodic nature, despite being a negative in some areas, is a strength for the majority of the time, as it expertly expands upon the world established in the two OVAs. I\u2019ve barely even mentioned the story of Ursula in this review, though I will say that it provides one of the great student-teacher duos in a year full of such duos. It all feels exactly like Yoshinari had planned this from the very beginning, and to see this long running, crowd-funded project come to fruition is truly a sight to behold. The fact that it does so while also providing a great escapist experience for our troubled times, reflecting those troubled times in the backdrop, and displays a multi-faceted and nuanced mythos and cast of characters makes the series a definite success, as well as an effective reconstruction of the fun side of Magical Girl series, and definitely one of my favourite Anime of the year.\\n\r\nTL;DR: \u2018Little Witch Academia\u2019 is utterly magical! The character are magical! The setting is magical! The style is Magical! The series represents all of Trigger\u2019s best qualities as a studio, and stands as possibly their strongest work to date, as well as serving as a fun dose of Magical Girl entertainment with a broad appeal. This right here, is why we watch Anime, because at the end of the day, it\u2019s fun!",

            "content": "As a fan of the original OVAs I really, really wanted to like this series. Unfortunately, every week brings another disappointment.  I greatly enjoyed the first episode, the broom race episode and the episode centered around Sucy, but beyond those I struggled not to feel massively let down.\r\nStory:\r\nEvery episode seems like a run-on sentence, with no finesse to speak of. In one episode, dragons steal the sorcerer's stone, they try to get it back, the dragons are robots being controlled by an actual dragon who's an investor that the academy owes money to, Diana shows up and is conveniently the only person who canread dragon ruins and the contract is voided. what??\\n\\n\r\nThere are also a lot of completely irrelevant Chekhov's guns that go absolutely nowhere. For example, the episode Night Fall. The episode opens with a focus on Lotte talking to someone named BigBen on her crystal ball/computer, planning to meet up at the Night Fall event. She mentions BigBen a few other times in the episode, building our expectations for their encounter. However, once they meet, BigBen has absolutely zero relevance to the plot, and simply disappears. There are many other poorly planned and irrelevant inclusions like this throughout the series. Also, things that should have been included but weren't. Example: episode 14, the faeries who maintain the school go on strike. What faeries?? if they're so integral to the school's ability to function, maybe they should have been shown or mentioned at least once!\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art and animation is also very disappointing. I understand that a 25 episode series can't maintain the same level of quality as the OVAs, but the shots are just plain awful at every turn. Most scenes consist of the characters standing around talking with a bare-bones background. In an anime about a magic academy, world building is crucial. The environment should be magical in and of itself, or at least not completely barren and bland. There are also plenty of careless mistakes. In episode 14, Lotte and Akko are standing in a field. Two teachers show up. Suddenly, Sucy is there, as if she'd been there all along. It's a far cry from what I've come to expect from Studio Trigger.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n-Way too Akko-centric\\n\r\n-why are the teachers so incompetent\\n\r\n-why has Sucy been reduced to a background piece who spouts bad one-liners\\n\r\n-why is Diana so good at everything, where did her secret dorky side go\\n\r\n-if they spent the first 13 episodes on world-building and character development episodes, why aren't any of the characters developed and why isn't the world built\\n\r\n-a disappointing lack of cute character moments, like when Sucy turned Akko's hair into a plant\\n\r\n-why doesn't Sucy use her arms???\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I had hoped this show would be cute, fun, and have a careful amount of detail put into developing these beloved characters. Instead, it's a completely disjointed slapped-together mess. It seems as if the writers are misunderstanding what makes a magic school such an enchanting premise. I wanted to like it so badly, but I can't pretend that I'm not incredibly disappointed.",

So you shouldn't really look at the score, but the subjective comments of the reviews, unless of course you're looking for some sort of miraculous master piece.\r\nFull:\r\nAnyways, to actually review the show. It isn't mind-boggling, out of this world, amazingly unique, or any of the like. Although, it does one thing and one thing right. It knows it's a rather tropey, cliche show about an underdog in a magical world full of great things. And it doesn't shy away from that, rather itbuilds itself on being that. It doesn't try to add a twist that doesn't make sense, to simply put it, it's a well made show that does its job, which is being an innocent show about a young girl trying to become her idol, obliviously becoming the best damn witch in the world. The plot isn't anything it shouldn't be and is treated well, and set-up neatly. The world building is great, the show manages to give you a peer into the world without it being too forced or too shy. The music is amazing as expected. Characters are all unique, and follow their cliche archetypes well and greatly. Art is definitely something else compared to normal anime with it being somewhat westernized.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\r\nSo in conclusion, this isn't gonna solve world hunger or anything, it simply delivers on being a really well-rounded show. The hype is definitely gonna be a misleading factor to viewers who aren't fans. But if you are thinking of watching this, this is the kind of show older fans in anime would most probably like, if you're sick of all the random nonsensical stories where everything feels drawn-out or weird. It does its job well of being the magical world of a young girl trying to do her best. Overall great show to enjoy",

            "content": "If any fans of the original Little Witch Academia film or fans of its sequel The Enchanted Parade are reading this review and are worried about this TV adaptation holding up to the standard of its progenitors, allow me to lay your fears to rest. Little Witch Academia TV is GREAT. It is a worthy successor in every way to the movies that generated so much interest, but at the same time no knowledge of the two films is necessary to enjoy this new TV anime. The show is fun, light, and heartwarming, and I will confidently recommend it to anyone who is even slightlyinterested.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Exemplary of what anime can be. Every frame is beautifully rendered in a way that looks both meticulous and full of love of the craft.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good but unremarkable, although the OP is cute and the ED is gorgeously drawn.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Harry Potter in an all-girls school. Some unlikely misfit friends come together in a school for witches, and learn who they are and what they can do along the way. The tone is light, the challenges they face are believable within the world, and the story is driven by real-seeming characters with genuine interactions. As the series progresses a more serious plot begins to develop, which casts the light-hearted adventures taking place in a more serious light. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Unequivocally the high point of the show, even more so than the stellar art. The side characters are all great in their own right, but the main three are really the best that Little Witch Academia has to offer. Main character Akko is a perfect blend of annoying and endearing, and she sucks at magic just enough to act as an audience surrogate without being irritating about it. She is also a curious mix of plucky idiot and self-centered asshole in a way that really shouldn't work but somehow does anyway. Lotte, the most reserved member of the main cast, is the perfect balance of chill to Akko's complete lack thereof. Her presence really grounds the cast as a whole, as she is the most \"normal\" character of the bunch. Sucy, the third of the main characters and hands down my favorite, is a joy to watch. She is cynical, sarcastic, borderline evil, and a perfect wild card to pull the group into and out of danger with her dangerous potions and even more dangerous lack of safety standards. Episode 8, which is mostly about Sucy, is one of the best episodes of an anime I have seen in years. All in all, a great group of characters on which to focus our story.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is great. Watching it makes me feel good, which is really all I want in a lighthearted anime like this. It is funny, serious, and heartwarming by turns, and is always presented in a way that makes me want to be a part of the world it depicts. Fans of Harry Potter, fans of the preceding two films, and anime fans in general should not miss this show, and I would not be surprised if it turns out to be overall one of the best shows of 2017.",

Little Witch Academia is mostly episodic as most episodes are very different from one another. \\n\r\nIf you're looking for a magical academy drama like Harry Potter then you won't enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhile mostly being episodic Little Witch Academia deals with great themes of achieving your dream, appreciating others, determination, change, and friendship.\\n\\n\r\nThe worldbuilding for Little Witch Academia is great as it gives relevant names for every location in the show. We get certification of how some witches can only use magic in certain places than others,  We get information about the history of magic, how the students in Luna Nova Academy must obey the rules such as not leaving campus without permission to no allowing them to go to locations that Luna Nova that is off limits for students.\\n\r\nI could go on about how great the worldbuilding is but it will end up spoiling the show and I don't want anyone to get spoiled.\\n\\n\r\nI also really like how it references a lot of other Gainax/Trigger anime as well as humor and jokes in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing that I want to mention is the second half has a more serious tone and it's more plot driven and to be honest I really liked the second half more than the mostly episodic first half. \\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia (TV) is a very engaging/well-written series that will never bore you and it will keep you smiling from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the story for Little Witch Academia (TV) to be pretty awesome and it's very refreshing when compared to most anime that are coming out nowadays.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharterers.\\n\r\nThe characters in Little Witch Academia is honestly amazing and very likable in they own ways. Not to mention they have great character chemistry to one and another.\\n\r\nAkko is a great female lead.\\n\r\nShe's a very energetic and determined girl who wants to achieve her dream despite her shortcomings by being an ordinary girl with no witch blood.\\n\r\nSome people may find her annoying in the beginning but in my opinion, she's the perfect type of annoying you can relate to from start to finish.\\n\r\nNot mention he she has great and believable character development especially in the second half. Plus she's very relatable.\\n\r\nShe's one of my favorite female protagonist in recent memory.\\n\\n\r\nSucy is the aloof, sarcastic and sadistic character of the show who likes to use Akko as a text subject for her experiments. I can't say anything more about this but all I say is she a fun and likable character overall but I wish she had more screen time in the second half of the show as well as having a bit of character development in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nLotte is a rather patient and studious character of the group. She also a supportive character who likes help her friends mainly Akko.\\n\r\nLike Sucy she's a fun and likable character. Also like Sucy I wish she had more screen time in the second half as well a bit character development because I found her to very interesting and likable. \\n\\n\r\nDiana is a serious esteemed witch from a long line of witches who is the top student in knowledge and magic.\\n\r\nShe's honestly my favorite character in this show. \\n\r\nI personally like her personality as well her development as the series progresses on. Not to mention like Akko she very relatable.\\n\r\nOverall Diana is an awesome that I adored from start to finish \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are also great.\\n\r\nThey are very likable, enjoyable to watch from start to finish and they brought more life to the show\\n\\n\r\nOverall besides the lack of screen time for Sucy and Lottte in the second half, this character cast was great from start to finish.\\n\r\n9.5/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nVisuals.\\n\r\nVisually Little Witch Academia looks good for the most part\\n\r\nThe background scenery is defined by thin lines and washed out colors. They are very well detailed and well drawn but they are mostly static.\\n\r\nThe characters designs minus Sucy have very similar size and body types. However, the characters faces and movement are very different for each character and it gives them a personality of they own. Immediately by watching the show, you will see that Akko is an energic, Sucy is an old sarcastic girl or Diana is a hotty top student.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of actual animation, the character movement is easy to follow. Things like the motions of clothing hair, ribbon caps, magical effects or broomsticks are what gives the visuals a lot of their flare. Plus it's very well animated.\\n\r\nOverall the visuals are great but can be a bit repetitive at times in terms of size and body types\\n\\n\r\n8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is almost entirely orchestral pieces and consists of a handful of themes with lots of variations and rearrangements of each.\\n\r\nThese orchestral pieces are amazing, very enjoyable to listen and have a purpose for each scene.\\n\r\n Michiru Oshima did an amazing job with this soundtrack as it makes each scene more impactful. \\n\r\nThe sound effects used in this show is great. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and endings themes are really good.\\n\r\nFrom the happy adventurous of the first opening Shiny Ray to the more slightly serious opening that some foreshadowing towards the end of the opening, \\n\r\nBoth ending themes are really\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is simply top notch.\\n\r\nAll of the seiyuu's did a great job for voicing each character. \\n\r\nI cannot about the dub because it hasn't been released yet but the dub of the TV series will be available on Netflix soon.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the soundtrack was amazing the openings and ending themes were great and the voice acting was wonderful and well acted.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts.\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia (TV) is a breath of fresh air when compared to most anime that are coming out nowadays. Cough *Eromanga Sensei*\\n\r\nThe story was great and very enjoyable, has great worldbuilding, great theme exploration, a strong likable cast from start to finish, great visuals and animation.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is amazing as well as the opening and endings and voice acting is wonderful. \\n\\n\r\nIt has some minor hiccups such as lack of screen time for certain characters in the second half as well mostly repeating the size and body types for the character designs but these minor hiccups are easily ignored due how great the story and characters were. \\n\\n\r\nThis is easily one of the best anime to ever come out in the last two years.\\n\r\nUnlike Eromanga Sensei that represents everything that is wrong about modern anime and it's also one of the worst anime I have ever seen in my life. Little Witch Academia (TV) represent everything that is great about modern anime and for that reason, I give the show as well as the director You Yoshinari full respect.\\n\\n\r\nIt may not be the perfect anime but compared to most anime that I have seen over the years this show almost represents everything that I love about this entire anime medium. \\n\\n\r\nThis show will make you laugh, it will make you cry and it will make you smile with joy and determination. \\n\\n\r\nThank you to all the creators for making this wonderful anime and I hope this gets a Blu-Ray/DVD release in the future.\\n\\n\r\nI give Little Witch Academia (TV) a 9.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway this was Shawn aka KurataTrigger and I will see you guys next time.\\n",

            "content": "Disclaimer: the following review/analysis is oriented towards those who finished the series, and as such, there will be spoilers.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nLittle Witch Academia is Yoh Yoshinari's precious child, who is one of the most important and iconic animators this industry has. It's at the same time, a love letter to it, with clear intent, wanting to be a message of hope to everyone looking to be part of it eventually. Unfortunately, he is an animator, not a writer (though he most likely wasn't alone in this), and said intentions are not backed up by the execution of the piece once examined under the cold eye of themonocle-wearing critic who thinks too highly of themself despite of their own contradiction-riddled writing, yet far from a complete dreck. This \"love letter\" has fundamental problems with its setting, plot, pace, characters, and a strangely ambiguous thematic simplicity that I can only attribute to the core idea Yoshinari tried to bring forward getting in the way of the show's story, and that's without touching details like the amounts of redundancy in the dialogue or some poorly paced scenes that end with no momentum. Little Witch Academia is an anime that always finds a way to squander its potential, and I'll proceed to explain myself.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, lets talk about anime and animators. How is this related to our little witches? The show acts like a metaphor to the journey of the young animator in the industry, an ideal represented by Kagari Atsuko (Akko), where the magic world symbolizes anime and its institutions. Many animators are inspired from a very young age by one piece of animation that resonates with them, which leads them to choose said profession. The world of animation (and anime) is alive as long as there is new people that wants to work in it, and it's also necessary that veterans are able to train them for that.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the obvious Nine Old Men (google it) reference within the show's lore through the Nine Old Witches, there are more nods to this metaphor. The show alludes to3DCG animation with Croix and her technology entering the scene, and the end of the series calls back to the cycle that perpetuates the existance of magic/anime in this world. During the spectacle that the outcome of the final showdown against Croix's mad missile generates, we see people being enchanted again by magic, and then we cut to a close shot of a little girl being amazed by it, symbolizing that Akko has inspired a generation younger than her to pursue the road of magic, same as how Chariot inspired her, in the same way this series and its climatic ending may inspire those who see it. This is why the show is a love letter to anime.\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, Little Witch Academia is without a doubt the most consistently high quality production Trigger has made (Kiznaiver exists, but this is also two cours), with a similar artstyle to western cartoons, mixed with limited animation techniques here and there like heavy use of smearing, and intense focused \"sakuga\" moments that manage to impress on a technical level. All of this coupled with a brilliant OST composed by Michiru Oshima, that adds in a fantastic way to the tone the series has both in its heavier and lighter moments.\\n\\n\r\nPoetic, isn't it? But the praise stops here.\\n\\n\r\nAbout pacing, Little Witch Academia starts with Akko finding the broken underexplained McGuffin known as Shiny Rod in her road to Luna Nova, which is followed by a series of western inspired episodic adventures of little importance that will either reveal some detail about the world or a quirk about the characters. We don't get exposition regarding the words plot up until episode 11, and the main antagonist is only introduced by episode 14. What follows during the second half is a weird alternance of proper plot related episodes and episodic content similar to most of the show's first half, making for some jarring contrast between episode and episode. Even then, the show finds its focus again around episode 21, and rushes to the conclusion. It's uneven, and tries to tie things up way too fast, with too little to keep itself interesting in the first half, and too much to cram in the end without forcing it.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no inherent problem with an episodic structure, many magical girl anime like Princess Tutu, Full Moon wo Sagashite and Shoujo Kakumei Utena got it right. The problem with Little Witch Academia is that most of these episodes are bland, employ clich\u00e9 plots, are cheap excuses to force screentime for irrelevant characters, and overall give way too little substance (or have little value) besides spectacle, which again wouldn't be a problem if the series wasn't trying to get you invested in anything else than that. At the same time, the series has a strong tendency to forcefully validate Akko's disruptive and intrusive behaviours, usually through the implementation of some plot device that achieves this (often the Rod) and often resolves the conflict. Then, one other time the show rewrote a character from the opposing side to reach a resolution, during Diana's arc, where after showing her aunt as this one dimensional snake lady, it's revealed that she actually cares about the family's legacy, and will try to keep it up while she follows her dream in Luna Nova. This makes the resolutions idealized and convenient. Little times a conflict is solved by the agency of our characters or an instance of personal growth, and while the series often returns to the status quo, these rare ocasions end up being the best episodes because there's real catharsis to be found in them. These exceptions are episodes 11, 13, 14, and from episode 21 onwards where the show focus on what matters, exploring Akko's relationship with Chariot, the past of the latter, and finally resolving who Akko wants to be. Even then, it takes 21 episodes of justifying everything with passion and simple motivations until something more interesting happens with her character. Finally, this ends up making Akko a character favoured by the plot, result given by the rather low stakes situations the show puts her in, which are resolved with no real growth from her part (see the exceptions). The series hides in Akko, whose story is about maturing and personal growth, someone with a Mary Sue treatment. Akko is rewarded for who she is and what she represents, not for the person she grows to be during her journey, in the same fashion as Hajime from Gatchaman Crowds (but Crowds doesn't pretend that there is a journey for Hajime, who is a stand-in for most of her show's ideas).\\n\\n\r\nOther of the problems Little Witch Academia has is its handling of the setting. We see some places and factions, but they are vaguely explored or barely important, like witches from other places who appear on one episode and are never brought back again, meaning that there is little to no expansive worldbuilding outside what's relevant inmediately to the story. We learn that the witches had a 1500+ years old debt with a dragon because no one took responsibility to learn/recover dragon language in order to read or translate the damn contract, but then Diana comes with her teenage wisdom to save the day and put the drake on his place, since she DID study/learn dragon language apparently. The \"adults are useless\" trope is implemented to push this idea of the incomeptence veterans have for training the new generations, drawing a parallel with the anime industry metaphor. In doing so, said execution generates a tonal clash regarding a situation about the world that should be taken more seriously, compared to how the series treats other similar moments, and it's one of the elements that leads the series to validate otherwise questionable developments, for how it makes impossible to take the old witches in charge seriously (and end up being fairly irrelevant to the plot... as expected anime, you can't have people that make sense solving your plots, can you?). For example, there's no ambiguety when Ursula defends Akko from being expelled/suspended from Luna Nova after clearly breaking the rules (Akko avoiding being expelled for Ursula's intervention and instead being suspended would make for a nice moment of self-reflection, that still rewards her efforts in some way, adding complexity to both her character and the outcome of her actions), or that never in the second half the authorities of Luna Nova question or check what Croix is doing in her suspicious omious tower (which is in reality a minor contrivance).\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the faction of british gentlemen, which includes Andrew. It's implied that they finance Croix, but it's never explored why, and out of them \"hating witches\" (which is also not explored) they don't have an interesting dynamic with the world. Andrew himself is sidelined, and his role in the climax is very small (Gentlemen: -Shut down the cameras! Andrew:-No! I believe in these witches! Gentlemen: -Ok.) but he is more important as an ear to Akko, as well as someone who she inspires the capacity of trusting witches, eventually. He also gives Akko the idea of being herself, by herself, rather than by Chariot.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the side cast (Diana, Chariot, and Croix are mains) have personalities defined by only one trait or superficial quirk. Jasminka eats a lot, Constanze does tech stuff and doesn't talk, Sucy is sadistic and experiments with mushrooms, Lotte is shy, likes Nightfall and has fairy magic, Diana's minions are just that, and Amanda is a tomboy archetype with nothing else. All of these are characters you can define in half a sentence, that exist to represent how Akko through her forceful behaivour managed to have friends who act later as an emotional cushion for her. It's incredibly basic and boring seeing how Akko instead of building most of these relationships through mutual understanding, she's forced into being accepted by external plot elements. The exception to this is her relationship with Diana, which has its problems, but nontheless it has conflicts, a dynamic, and only when Akko helps her to face her family and understand her problems is when they really become friends, and it make sense that it's Diana the one that puts Akko back on her feet in episode 23 after the twist of episode 22. Which leads us to the next point.\\n\\n\r\nThe story between Chariot and Croix, once revealed, destroys Akko emotionally, who eventually gets back on her feet once Diana conforts her. The problem is that besides using a lot of contrived friendships as a reinforcement (note also how little Lotte and Sucy appear during the second half of the show), this makes Diana's character being limited as an emotional support to Akko, and the show in its intent to portray its metaphor, ends up giving more value to her passion above Diana's ethic towards hard work, which she upheld all her childhood (or even more important than Akko's own resolve to work hard and not take shortcuts, since it's never brought up in their exchange!). This leaves a mixed message, almost on some wish-fulfilling tone, extremely simplified and idealistic. Luckily the series doesn't intend to depreciate hard work (scenes like Akko meeting Woodward and Diana's arc suggest this), yet ends up doing it because of its execution.\\n\\n\r\nThe revelations themselves during episode 22 (extended to 23) give new meaning to the series in many layers, and make it interesting again in a moment where it was feeling empty. Even then, the series limits its potential again by making Chariot ultimately a victim of Croix's deception, which goes back to a simplistic characterization that doesn't innovate nor is particularly interesting, if not for her burden and regret regarding her negligency (and projection of her wishes on Akko) towards her student. Meanwhile, the show makes its best to paint Croix as a mustache twirling villain (who does unquestionably bad things) to redeem her at the last second when everything goes wrong, without implying that her actions in the end have been punished, since she had \"good intentions\". But that's probably sadism on my part. The true villain of the series is Woodward and the garbage tier guidance they offered to the girls (Chariot and Croix) which is never genuinely addressed even if it's where Croix's character and misguided actions come from.\\n\\n\r\nThe conflict during the last act is based on the antagonist accentuating negative emotions in the population with a fishy football game acting as a cathalyst, to then gather said emotions as magic energy and destroy the seal of Grand Triskellion. Finally, the climax goes from a final boss battle where she finds out that the power she sought wasn't what she thought it was, to said boss (Croix) losing control of her technology, (in the same way Chariot lost control of her magic collection technique) unintentionally releasing a mass destruction missile built by the uncontrolled rage of the mob. With the conflict now not being focused on Croix, everyone is now a good person, and all that's left is convincing the world that magic is cool, which happens. The thing is that this outcome is forced, since Chariot and Croix are suddenly able to livestream and comment the event from thin air (an event that occurs in the stratosphere(!)) which enables people to see it and do the 180\u00b0 turn from almost starting a war to cheer and give them energy (don't ask how, Grand Triskellion does the trick) so that Diana and Akko can defeat the missile. This is, again, as it's an habit of the series, idealistic and forced plotting because magic is wonderful. Friendship is magic, and passion is what's most important. The major credit I can give to the finale is that it's extremely climatic, features the best bits of animation in the whole show, it's somewhat possible to just take what it presents at face value for that, and closes the meta-text the series has been building with its analogy regarding the anime industry in a clever, subtle way, even if the communicated message is ambiguous without this interpretation.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, Little Witch Academia had good intentions, but not the chops to carry them forward. In its ambition, it leaves blurry many details of its execution, which falls apart analyzing it bit by bit or as a whole, with an extra of mixed, unclear morals. Its intent enters in conflict with what it did, but it at least looked and sounded good. I begin to wonder if this could've been tighter if it was 13 episodes long.\\n",

            "content": "Little Witch Academy is way too overrated. OVA and movies were good but this series is just weak compared to those.. plot is slow and filled with plotholes., most characters have only 1 aspect that describes them and episode endings and reveals are all very pretictable and cliche. \r\nAlso, episodes lack proper build up for their reveals (for example in 5th episode attack of dragons came out of nowhere, main dragon being harmless buisnessman came out of nowhere, school being in debt and owning money to dragon came out of nowhere, debt being scam came out of nowhere, Diana knowing ancient dragonese came out ofnowhere.. pretty much whole episode came out of blue). Lack of build up means that viewer can't really guess where story is heading and thus can't fully experience story of this series. After seeing 1 or 2 episodes of random surprises, this gimmick can't really carry story forward. \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, because it is episodic series then that means that stories are usually self contained and thus  solving plotholes should be done before the episode or during the episode. Otherwise we already have moved to different storyarc and plothole solving of previous arc after it has already resolved feels out of place. Currently there is almost no overarching storyline where time of solving plotholes doesn't matter.  Unlike Mob Psycho 100 there doesn't seem to be bigger arc toward what episodic series is building it's story and thus story of this series seems to be quite weak.\\n\\n\r\nIf we didn't had legendary OVA then this series would be considered avarage at best. 6th episode was more logical storyline than in previous episodes and because of that this series might get better in later episodes.. although start of this series is still way too weak.",

            "content": "Watching Little Witch Academia is like looking back into a portal to my youth. A time when Cartoon Network ruled the world! While I was born at the tail end of the nineties, and thus didn't experience what many people consider to be the golden age for the network, I did grow up watching re-runs of many of the shows that established the network and what made it so infamous during the early 2000s. Shows like Johnny Bravo, The Powerpuff Girls, Dexter's Laboratory and a plethora of others quickly became my favourite cartoons, and I still love them to this day, looking back on eachwith found feelings of nostalgia. Little Witch Academia evokes these similar feelings in me of nostalgia, and it's a sort of feeling that I honestly find hard to properly articulate since it is so raw and personal. The anime genuinely feels that it could have aired on Cartoon Network considering how fun, charismatic, and full of energy the entire show actually is, and with each passing episode, Little Witch Academia becomes even more charming and lovable, so much so, that this anime has become a personal favourite of mine! Through its wonderfully creative world, diverse and interesting cast, and bouncy animation, Little Witch Academia is easily the most fun I've had with a piece of media in a very long time, and despite some flaws in terms in its narrative, the entire show, in my eyes, is a wonderful representation of what can be accomplished in animation. With that all said and done, let's dive into why I believe this show to be as great as I proclaim it is!\\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia is set in a world in which the use of magic is being used less as a viable means in everyday life, but, despite that, there are still a plethora of witches who wish to learn and study magic for themselves, keeping the world of magic alive. One such girl happens to be our main protagonist, Atsuko Kagari, or simply Akko, who, after seeing a live magic show by a witch named Shiny Chariot, inspires her to take up magic herself, with the ultimate goal of meeting her idol one day, and learning how to use magic in order to put smiles on people's faces and help them forget about their troubles and grief. However, there is only one problem. Akko is totally inept when it comes to magic, having come from a family with no lineage of witches, and performing terribly in her classes at school when it comes to magic participation. She can't ride a broom while everyone else can, finds basic spells difficult while messing up everything she attempts to do while dragging everyone else into her mishaps and incidents. While we do learn the reason why Akko is so incompetent when it comes to magic in the twenty seconded episode, resulting in a great emotional plot twist, Akko's lack of ability and lack of knowledge for the magical world, in general, helps make her more relatable for an audience watching. She assumes the underdog role for this tale, and there is a general sense of cathartic pay off seeing her succeed in her magic studies and spells when others doubt her or assume she will never succeed, yet still proves them wrong. Much like how the audience doesn't know anything about this world, nor does Akko, and this allows the audience to experience the world through her eyes. As Akko learns and grows in this world, the audience does too, which helps the audience grow more attached to Akko as a person. It's the same emotions evoked in watching someone try their hardest and then eventually succeeding after hard work that makes the series incredibly addictive to watch, at least for me anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, back to the plot, as Akko attempts to get to Luna Nova for her first day of school, she finds it impossible to get there since a broom is needed to go through a magical road, but she meets a girl called Lotte, who becomes a good friend of Akko, who then gives her a ride to the school. However, whilst travelling in this magical road, they are thrown off course and are transported into another area, where they meet up with Sucy, whom will become another friend of Akko's. They're attacked by strange creatures, Akko finds Chariot's Shiny Rod, saves the day by enchanting a magic word, and makes it to the school just in time. The next few episodes sees Akko and her friends attending school will many different magical problems ensue, but the series begins to introduce a more central and focused narrative with Akko attempting to find seven magic words that she believes will bring her closer to Shiny Chariot, which will also activate the Grand Triskelion. A powerful magic that has the power of reconstruction, but, for the most part, the series is fairly episodic, which can be used as a critique against the show. However, each episode has enough energy and charisma, as well as variety to keep things fun and never felt boring and repetitive. From a race on broomsticks to reviving a skeleton, to building a giant ship that turns into a giant robot reminiscent of Gurren Laggen, the entire series uses its magical world in neat and creative ways, making the show an absolute blast to watch. Since anything is possible in a world full of magic, the show remains incredibly addicting to watch since we never know what the show may bring to the table next and each scenario the characters find themselves in is fun as all hell, and the character interactions never fail to put a smile on my face. The world of Little Witch Academia feels alive and vibrant, with so many things to discover and find intrigue in. One thing in particular that I always found interesting was Akko's journey to find the words needed to meet Shiny Chariot. As she searched for each one, she always ran into interesting witches of the past and discovered several past secrets about the world of magic. There is a lot of care put into its world-building elements and each one feels extremely memorable. Each event and scenario is tangential to this main idea of Akko growing, not only as a witch in regards to her improving her magical abilities, but also as a person too, and each one of the words, and their meanings parallels this growth as well.  \\n\\n\r\nAs the show moves into a more central narrative and introduces a villain for the show, the story is filled with much more emotional depth and is genuinely heartwarming in a lot of places too. One of the most interesting themes the show presents is the idea of old customs, such as magic, slowly being less needed in the world as it becomes more developed and technologically advanced. This theme of technology versus magic is integrated well, as if it was an issue in our very own world, and is explored in interesting ways to aid character development, especially in regards to Diana's characters, in which one of her arcs as a character is focused on her wanting to continue the proud lineage of her family, which is becoming increasingly difficult to do in this ever-changing world. Another example where this element is done especially well is the relationship that builds between Andrew and Akko after Akko sneaks into his party, where many upper-class witches and people gathered. Andrew, being incredibly sceptical of the world and potentials of magic, and Akko, being the loud person that she is when projecting her love for magic, initially clash upon their first meeting, but as the show goes along, Andrew warms up to Akko, and, in turn, the world of magic as well, and begins to slowly appreciate its potential use in society. This also results in some of my favourite movements in the show, seeing Akko and Andrew working together and their chemistry is genuinely great as well. Each episode is devoted to fleshing out a character or giving some them some time to shine, through the use of magic in creative ways. The comedy and character interactions feel organic and the show has such a wonderful charm about it that I found myself smiling a plethora of times, especially seeing Akko grow as a person. As the show goes along, Akko learns shapeshifting magic, allowing her to change into various different animals, all of which are fun and are used in smart ways, while also looking absolutely adorable, especially the mouse transformation.  This is perhaps best integrated in the twenty-first episode when Akko is rapidly changing between different animals whilst fighting against a large python.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I have praised the story of Little Witch Academia a lot, it's still without its problems. For starters, the plot can feel a little too convenient at times, such as in the very first episode where Akko just so happens to come across Shiny Chariot's rod while in a forest and some of the moments can feel too silly or contrived for my liking, such as when Akko comes across a super fast broom that is legendary in the world of magic, in a simple magic shop rather than in a museum, or, better yet, in Nuva Lova itself. However, while there are a few of these issues, I never found it ever to be too intrusive on my immersion or enjoyment of the series nor is it necessarily a game breaker either. The episodic plot lines may be annoying to some people wanting an overarching story all the way through, but, as I said, I believe each episode to be fun and creative enough to stand by itself, so I had no problem in regards to this area. One plot line can feel a little too predictable if you ask me, but, again, is something that doesn't really take all too much away from the overall experience or narrative.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also pretty great too, with each one having a very distinct personality that bounces off each other very well, especially in regards to the main trio, Akko, Sucy and Lotte. Akko is a character I've already talked about in detail, but her development and her character arc presented in episode twenty-two after learning something that changes her perception of her world are easily the best parts of the show, and seeing her grow into a more rounded person proves to be highly satisfying. She is a good lead for a show of this nature, taking into account her inquisitive nature, and she is often used for comedic, slapstick effect as well. While she can sometimes be a little too annoying in the early parts of the series, and some of her lines and dialogue and lines about dreams and passion can come across a little too corny as well, Akko's character is one that I wanted to see succeed; I became invested enough in her character to do so. Not only that, but she has a clearly defined goal in the series, which helps with plot progression as well as direction.\\n\\n\r\nLotte and Sucy are two of Akko's personal close friends who share one room together, and, as the series progresses, begin to bond closer to one another too. Lotte is much simpler than the other characters, both in design and personality, as she is perhaps the most down to Earth and calmest of the bunch. She plays the typical nerdy sort of character, and while she does receive some development, she is kind of pushed out from the forefront in favour of Akko. She has her moments but is far from being one of my favourite characters. Sucy, on the other hand, is the best girl of all times. Her appearance alone can convey everything about her character, and her voice actress does an amazing job at enhancing it too. She is essentially a pessimistic mushroom magic user, who finds enjoyment in using Akko as an experimental guinea pig while laughing maniacally about it. However, in the eighth episode of the series, and one of the best in my eyes, Akko has to dive into Sucy's subconscious, and there she meets hundreds of different versions of Sucy, all of which have different personalities to that of the original, representing Sucy's repressed emotions. While in this world, Akko watches a bunch of movies, that are Sucy's memories, and we learn that one of Sucy's best moments comes from her first meeting with Akko, and the various adventures they had up to that point. It's a sweet moment and gives us more indication that Sucy does care about her deep down, than what we were lead to believe from the start. \\n\\n\r\nDiana's character also goes through a lot of development, as she begins to respect and grow fond of Akko more and more in response to Akko's improved magical abilities such as in episode thirteen, when Akko proves her magical capabilities in front of a massive audience while taking on, and even helping, a large, cursed creature. While Diana, in the early parts of the series is stuck-up and pretty bitchy, she becomes more bearable and likeable as the episodes come along, especially over the course of her own respective story arc in the nineteenth and twentieth episodes, which I touched on briefly before, but also in episode twenty-three when she is talking to Akko in a cafe and opens up her own childhood love of Shiny Chariot as well. It explains why her character acts and behaves the way she does and also adds deeper insight and depth to her as a person too. Andrew's character too, as I've touched upon too, also develops in the scene that he comes to understand and appreciate the world of magic a bit more, but his character is also a gateway to understanding the rest of the world's stance of how magic is used in the modern era, and, I've said, I really liked the relationship formed him and Akko. While it is nothing romantic, there are slight hints of it here and there, but it never comes to any surface level or feels too intrusive on the more interesting aspects of the show.  \\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly, the crux of the show and its narrative weight is the relationship between Akko and Ursula-sensei, and while I won't get too much into the specifics why and what this entails, since I want to avoid spoilers as much as possible in this review, just note that this is the one that forms the backbone for the series to rest upon. The other members of the cast are also very fun to watch as well, whether that be the various teachers with their odd eccentricities, such as professor Lukic, a mad potions teacher who lines never failed to make me laugh. One of my favourites of the side characters was Constanze, who doesn't even utter a single word yet we can understand what she is thinking just from her body language and facial expressions alone. We don't really learn or understand why she doesn't speak in the series, but she allows us to understand that the world of magic is not all about wands, but also machinery, as she seems to merge both technology and magic together, adding onto the theme I was talking about earlier. She also has my favourite episode in the show in which she builds a giant ship that transforms into a robot, which is an obvious homage to Gurren Laggan, typical of Studio Trigger. Also, that little smile that Constanze delivers the end of the episode after being thanked by Akko is wonderfully adorable. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, this is probably the best (and most consistent) show that Trigger has made thus far. The animation is very bouncy, with lots of energy and pull and stretch for that cartoon-y esque feel. It genuinely feels that, while not as polished, it could be a show that someone like Disney would create, in regards to how colourful, creative and fun everything is. It's character designs are great and can tell you everything about the character's personality just from a glance and it can sometimes showcase some absolutely fantastic animation. However, there are some art issues here and there, but, for the most part, the animation is so bouncy that it doesn't really affect the show all too much. The music is also pretty damn good with two amazing opening tracks, \"Shiny Ray\" and \"MIND CONDUCTOR\". I especially love the opening animation to MIND CONDUCTOR too, and the music used in the show itself is also great, especially the main theme. It is catchy, memorable and damn well composed, adding onto the more heartfelt and emotional moments the anime attempts to convey.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can't yet tell from my relentless praise, I love this show. It is a wonderful reminder of why I love animation as a whole and the entire show has such an innocent, child-like wonder about it as well. From its wonderful characters, great narrative and creative world, this show ticks all the boxes for me personally in terms of what a show should have, and I do highly recommend this anime, as well as the two movies that came before it as well. Little Witch Academia has the luxury of being an original show, and thus also has one of the most satisfying conclusions I've seen in a long time, which only further cemented this anime as one of my favourites of all time. Everything about this show has a genuine sense of, well, genuineness about it, and it feels like the team behind it put their all into making it, and had a blast while doing so, which is all I can really ask for at the end of the day. With that, I thank you for reading my review, and I wish you all a great day!\\n",

            "content": "A small preamble - in my opinion \"Little Witch Academia\" already deserves praise for being an anime deviating from the norm, a piece of art that indicates hope for the revitalization of the whole anime industry. And even more so, if we keep in mind that the original story (short film) was released 2013 as part of the 'Young Animator Training Project's Anime Mirai' project, its second movie was entirely realized due to crowd funding, both attempting to showcase an exceptional, magical fairy tale of a young girl, striving to become a great witch. \r\n_____________________________________________\r\nRight from the start, the viewer is instantly drawn into aworld of traditional fantasy and folklore, where magic is not just a simple word, but an essential part of life and the entire world (building).\\n\\n\r\nStory - \"Little Witch Academia\" follows a trio of girls, Akko and her friends, Lotte and Sucy, as they experience many magical adventures together. Akko has a big dream, therefore she decided to enroll in the 'Luna Nova Magical Academy' to become a great witch like her idol Shiny Chariot, whom most people in Luna Nova Academy consider a fraud. The story follows the daily struggle of the trio, whereas Akko has to deal with even more difficulties due to her non-magical background as a first generation witch from Japan. Still, that never stops her from being energetic and cheerful, while overcoming the hardships of a witch (pupil) with her two besties.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is by no means bad, I'd rather say the monster and character design is eye-catching in a good way, especially with respect to the portrayal of the environment and beautiful background scenery. And even if one minds the slight 'simplicity' of the art every now and then, you should come to acknowledge that it perfectly fits the fantasy style of the anime in its entirety, expressing its own charm.\\n\\n\r\nAnother positive fact is that the anime completely manages without the heavy use and usual inclusion of romance, or other common themes - to gloss over a lack of creativeness and imagination - which we have already seen hundreds of times, over and over again. So if you're one of those people who are already tired of always seeing the same story-telling and generic stereotypes, you'll really come to love and appreciate \"Little Witch Academia\"'s unique way of telling an interesting adventure, including lively and versatile characters that are more than just simple decorations, which are often entirely overshadowed by the protagonist in other anime.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia unveils that every journey begins with a single step in the right direction, to realize one's own dreams and hopes, in one of the most heartwarming, funniest and enjoyable ways that you have ever seen - a truly rare gem. Furthermore, the anime delivers exactly what it promises, a light-hearted adventure in a fantasy world.\\n\\n\r\nTo cut a long story short, naturally, I'll refrain from giving a serious rating at this point of time, but if I have to express a vague direction I'd score the anime with a decent -8- at the moment, that scoring is also in regard to the prior movies as a justified basis, it will be changed appropriately in the end.",

            "content": "A magical world in Little Witch Academia is one I can describe as imaginatively beautiful. Beauty is expressed there not just by world fiction but by the context of its creativity. I don\u2019t mean just the world either but the show itself is filled with characters, themes, and storytelling that make you want to go back and watch it all over again. \r\nLittle Witch Academia is perhaps unique with the fact that it\u2019s an adaptation of a successful film. The first film originated in 2012 as part of the Young Animator Training Project and spawned a sequel titled Little Witch Academia: The Enchanted Parade. Now,we have a full TV series based on the franchise that all began from the creativity of those animators. Watching Little Witch Academia is pretty simple with an open mind especially if you\u2019re a fan of magical girl theme series. It has the characters that makes the storytelling feel special, a world with seemingly endless possibilities, and moments that will be unforgettable. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the first few episodes, we are introduced to the world that shows its content by events and story rather than a dull dialogues. School life at Luna Nova is also shown in details as we see how Akko, the main female protagonist lives her daily life. Of course, Luna Nova is no ordinary school and in fact contains lots of secrets that defies the law of nature. From here, you\u2019ll find witches, magical creatures, spellbooks, and iconic flying broomsticks. The storytelling connects to the history of the school with its characters as well so from in it, viewers will learn the origins of the world. What I find impressive is how this series continuously build on its world setting with every episode that makes you want to find out more and more.\\n\\n\r\nAt the centerpiece of the story is Akko. She\u2019s a young girl who has grew up to admire Shiny Chariot, a famous witch performer. This inspired Akko to actually attend Luna Nova and in essence, she hope to meet Shiny Chariot one day in person. While she\u2019s there, Akko also makes friends and rivals. Along her side, she is good friends with Lotte, a friendly girl with a talent of summoning spells. Then, there\u2019s Sucy the mischievous girl with a talent of potion making and causing bizarre incidents. These three characters all have different personalities but manages to get along as they learn more about each other. The character chemistry between the three evolves throughout the show although it doesn\u2019t exceed expectations. For instance, Lotte and Sucy gets less screen time later on as the plot evolves into much more complex twists and turns. Akko\u2019s growth as a character is what this show focuses on the most. From the start, she\u2019s a talentless witch and known for causing trouble. These often result in unintentional hazards but nonetheless, Akko is viewed as a fool by many of her professors and classmates in the beginning. Most interestingly though, Akko is able to wield the Shiny Rod, a staff that previously belonged to Chariot herself. In the meantime, there\u2019s also Diana, a character that stands as a foil to Akko. Unlike her, Diana is talented, comes from a prestigious family, and is respected by many of her classmates and professors. Her philosophy of magic also contrasts with Akko and in turn, she serves more or less as a rival; although this seemingly comes from Akko\u2019s point of view. As the series progresses, we can see that Diana is both impressed and surprised by Akko\u2019s feats in certain magic from certain episodes. In retrospect, character relationship in this show between friends and rivals evolves for fans to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the series itself contains a lot of goofy moments, it does have a serious side. The first half of the show involves mainly of how Akko and her friends gets used to academy life while the second half concentrates more on plot with the series getting more in-depth with its characters. One of the more noticeable character in the series is Ursula, a friendly professor that takes Akko under her wing. The two has a close relationship and Ursula realizes Akko\u2019s strong desire to become a witch. Furthermore, Akko and Ursula holds a similar belief in magic and it\u2019s from their philosophy that we can see how close they become. Now you may be questioning yourself: what about antagonists? Are there real threats that comes to surface against the main characters? To answer that, it\u2019s more about how the characters deals with them rather than just resolving certain conflicts. I can say honestly that the show is much more appealing when you invest into the character motivations and realize why characters do certain things. As such, Little Witch Academia isn\u2019t a magical girl show that\u2019s about saving the world from evil but rather much more focused on character building and realization. \\n\\n\r\nAs much as creative as Little Witch Academia seems to be, you may not be too impressed if you\u2019ve seen a lot of magical girl theme shows before. Magical schools is hardly a hot new theme as many series have done it before. Furthermore, our main character Akko can be frustrating to watch at times. Sure, she is fun to watch and brings a lot of comedy into the show. However, she is still considered one of the most talentless witches at the school and it\u2019s frustrating at times to see her fail in certain subjects. I can confess that sometimes, I wish she would just get it right the first time. Other characters in the show such as Amanda excels in certain areas that makes her look like an idiot at times too. This show does teach a valuable lesson though and is that hard work can have its own rewards and consequences.\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of studio Trigger, my expectations were definitely met with the production quality. It\u2019s goofy, cartoony, yet visually appealing that captures the magic of this series together. Characters\u2019 personalities matches with their appearances and everything seems to be in place according to its world fiction. Nova Luna is also designed in the way that I\u2019d picture it would be and like in the movies, it expands much more than just what it appears. Character expressions are also crafted in ways that look humorous especially for cases such as Akko and Sucy. I mean, who can forget when Akko transforms into an adorable mouse and running around at school? On the action side, the show does a neat job with formulating magic and showing how spells work beyond than words. \\n\\n\r\nI have to give some praise to the voice actors. Akko\u2019s voice sounds exactly how I would imagine with her impulsiveness and eager to succeed. On the other hand, I\u2019m also impressed by Diana\u2019s voice of confidence that makes her character status believable. Sucy is also noticeable for her meek yet mischievous voice tone that fits her personality perfectly. The OP and ED theme songs are also done with colorful choreography. While I can\u2019t say the OST is anything to take home, it\u2019s still serviceable to get the job done.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia is a beautifully crafted show that brings magic to a level that\u2019s larger than life. With a graceful cast of characters, memorable moments, creative storytelling, and imaginative world, it\u2019s definitely worth getting invested into. Even if you\u2019ve never seen the films or a magical girl show in your life, it\u2019s still a show that I can recommend for some wild and vivid fun. It hits the right numbers in many areas for what a magical girl show should be.\\n",

            "content": "Before I being, let me say this. I am very grateful to Tattun the producer, for visiting 4chan during the time LWA aired. Many fans, myself included, had the opportunity to ask him a bunch of questions, and learn a few interesting things about the story and characters. So in the unlikely chance you\u2019re reading this, Thank you buddy!\r\nLittle Witch Academia\u2019 (depending on viewers\u2019 opinion) can be summed up as either \u201ca charming, adventurous title; full of unique characters, interesting storylines, and filled with fun & entertainment.\u201d  On the other hand, it can be summed up as a disappointing, overly self-referential, lackluster title;full of too many western references, terrible pacing, filler, shoehorned, and plain one-dimensional characters.\\n\\n\r\nInside the magical, heartwarming tale of Little Witch Academia, we follow our annoying (but loveable\u2026 admit it!) protagonist Atsuko \u201cAkko\u201d Kagari. Akko is human with the burning passion of becoming a great witch like her idol Shiny Chariot! Watching the story unfold is one that viewers will certainly enjoy watching. Perhaps one of the most enjoyable things about little witch academia\u2019s story is that it provides multiple re-occurring themes that fit well with the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe best one that is shown over and over throughout the series is ambition. Many of the women enrolled at Luna Nova academy show determination, and work hard to achieve their personal goals. Akko of course has to work the hardest because she has no talent. It feels like such an accomplishment to witness Akko and the others achieving their goals! I felt like that was the biggest payoff the story had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nI was skeptical during the first 6 episodes; the content provided had failed to meet my expectations. In comparison to the OVA and movie, the quality of the TV anime appeared a bit more childish. The plot for each episode was overly simplified, coupled with terrible pacing. It was so bad that I felt like I was watching a children\u2019s show.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to studio triggers other titles, the content provided in LWAs\u2019 story is tame. You won\u2019t find over the top violence, blood and gore, overly sexualized characters, and other mature themes that you would usually see in a Trigger anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe transition from mature content to child-friendly was a little disappointing, and hard for me to get used to. But, after giving it some time, I got used to it. I must admit that Little Witch Academia\u2019s story is fine as it is, childish and all. Some of the best episodes provide viewers with interesting narratives, humorous content, a wee bit of romance, and finally thrilling action. The lackluster episodes are almost filler like, with unnecessary and unwanted subplots, which do not add anything further to the story. In short, the subplots ruin the pacing of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe middle of the series, the rising action, and the events leading to the climax of little witch academia was very disappointing. The pacing and action leading up to it was awful! It kills the hype that the show had previously had. It felt as if writers and director just wanted to rush into something bigger, as seen in episode 24. The writers ended whatever evil plot the antagonist had earlier, just to create another conflict which would have the Akko and friends defeat it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSupporting characters in the story?\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters that are not Ursula-sensei, lose their value towards the rising action. During the last four or five episodes; Sucy, Lotte, and Amanda\u2018s crew, are demoted to background characters, and get at least 10 minutes (if even that) of screen time. It isn\u2019t until last three episodes that we see the supporting characters comeback however; they\u2019re basically around just to cheer Akko as well as give her help when needed.\\n\\n\r\nThe 25 episodes of little witch academia were generally good, and at times decent. While I was not impressed with the pacing and filler; I did enjoy the sweet and tender parts the show had to offer. I gave the story and 7 and a half out of 10 because I felt that even though the show was good, it still had a bunch of glaring problems and wasted potential.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nI feel bad that there isn\u2019t much that I truly enjoyed about the supporting characters other than Ursula.\\n\\n\r\nI felt that Ursula was the only support that mattered because she helped the story progress. Diana would be a close second however; even she gets pushed to the side. Other than that, I felt that the characters were great. They were full of personality and fun to see on screen.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning I hated Akko. She\u2019s so one-dimensional. Not to mention she\u2019s annoyingly loud & dumb to the point where I just want to fast forward through every scene she is in. Despite this, Akko does have redeeming qualities to her; especially when her character starts to develop. In a weird way, she sort of reminds me of Naruto Uzumaki from the Naruto franchise. She\u2019s loud, annoying, and stupid. However, when she\u2019s determined to do something, she\u2019s willing to work hard, train, and never give up! It makes her fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, supporting characters lose all value (and to an extent) purpose. They\u2019re subjugated to being nothing more than background characters with little to no lines. I felt that, in exchange for an episode based upon a supporting character, they would have to lose their screen time in order for the story to focus more on Akko.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Visual direction/Sound\\n\\n\r\nCould have been better! I liked the designs; some of the settings were unique. The animation was okay. I wasn\u2019t impressed with it, I felt like some of the special effects were poor in quality. As far as the character designs go, I felt that they were great. I\u2019m honestly looking forward to the art book! WE WILL SUPPORT IT TATTUN!\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs were great; some of the background music was okay. I felt that some of the songs composed for this anime didn\u2019t quite fit well with the atmosphere & settings they took place in. Also, the music didn\u2019t do that good of a job bringing exciting moments to life.  The voice acting was great however, the audio quality sounds like they were using budget microphones in the studio. I listened to Little witch academia using \u201cBose quiet comfort 35\u201d headphones. I must admit, if you have a good pair of headphones or speakers, listen closely and you\u2019ll hear how bad the sound quality is. Especially during scenes where there are monologues.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall feelings.\\n\\n\r\nIs Little Witch Academia Academia a project Trigger should be proud of? I would say yes! It\u2019s different. It\u2019s something unique, I feel that it\u2019s one of those shows that could catch on, and sell well if marketed correctly. I strongly believe that LWA needs a push. It needs to branch out more to be successful. I\u2019m not saying that the series isn\u2019t, it\u2019s just that Trigger needs to make it stand out more. \\n\\n\r\nI felt that little witch academia was well worthy of an 8/10 and I would strongly recommend it!\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The magic is gone.\r\nThat may seem like a cutesy little Gene Shalit-esque pun to start off the review, but I mean it with all sincerity: the magic and charm of the original OVAs has, for the most part, vanished from its television adaptation. And as someone who adored the hell out of those OVAs, that's a goddamned shame.\r\nThis show has a clear two-half structure: the first was primarily character based, featuring episodic adventures to establish and flesh out the cast, while the second introduces the plot in full force. Now, some were unsatisfied with that first half, but I was willing to go along forthe ride. While there were some particularly weak episodes (gotta love Twilight pastiches in 2017, because that's relevant), some were quite enjoyable overall (episode 13 really comes matches some of the wonderment that characterized the first OVA), and that sense of fun carried me through.\\n\\n\r\nIt's when the plot kicks in that we run into trouble, because the plot... is stupid. Little Witch Academia is propelled entirely by an idiot plot, where things only happen because characters refuse to divulge critical information (Tell Akko not to trust Croix! She literally kidnapped Akko and tried to have you killed! Come on, at least give her a warning!) or characters are incapable of making the most simple of conclusions (Gee, I wonder if that evil magic robot that pushed Akko out of the tower and almost MURDERED her has anything to do with the ONE professor for tech magic who only showed up EXACTLY when this strike started and has tech that looks EXACTLY like that robot! Doesn\u2019t anyone else notice this? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!). Ursula has no excuse not to reveal her identity to Akko; whereas in the shorts, you could infer some personal history and perhaps shame, embarrassment, or regret colored her decision to lay low, the entire fate of the world apparently hangs in the balance now, but I guess it's better to keep everyone arbitrarily in the dark about details of paramount importance and hope everything works out for the best.\\n\\n\r\nStupid, and what moments aren't stupid are punctuated by an uninspired \"Hunt for the McGuffin\" plot that just seems entirely half-assed. \\n\\n\r\nCharacterization has also taken a noticeable hit. You see, I was hoping from Croix's juxtaposition against Diana in the second OP that while she might play an antagonistic role, she wouldn't be outright malicious, just somebody coming at this problem with a fundamentally different perspective, or maybe she'd have a personal schism with Chariot, and that the resolution of the plot would come after our characters could find some way to bridge these two sides...\\n\\n\r\nOh, wait, she's just moustache-twirlingly evil? Like a sidecutted knockoff of Snidely Whiplash? Gee wiz, for a second I was worried we might have an arc or something.\\n\\n\r\nThat's an even bigger disappointment considering what a good character Diana is. Part of what made LWA great was that, while Diana very easily could have been the stock-snotty bully, the shorts went to great lengths to show that she's ultimately well-intentioned, she just has a different perspective and attitude from Akko.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it's not like Trigger has completely forgotten what made LWA great; episode 13 is a standout moment, and captures the heart of the original two shorts. Unfortunately, that peak makes the contrast against its current lows all the more stark.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a lot to type up for a show about little girls training to become witches, and maybe I just hoped for too much, but I'm really let down. You can see the potential, but it's buried under an utterly bungled execution. My appreciation for the original shorts will likely keep me watching to the end on the off chance that something will fundamentally, radically change between then and now. However, if someone were to ask me if I think the show is worth their time, I would have to honestly tell them no. That hurts.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this, kids, is why you never wish on a monkey's paw.",

            "content": "This is my first review, I hope it's helpful! This review was written after 6 episodes have aired, on 2/18/2017. I will update this review as my thoughts on the series develop more thoroughly.\r\nTL;DR: The show so far has been pretty good so far, and I think people should give the show a chance. It's been episodic so far, so if you are a fan of episodic anime, you will probably enjoy this. If you aren't a fan of episodic anime, I definitely recommend you give the format a chance. I don't think Trigger will let you down come the end of the series, formore details read my full review.\\n\\n\r\nI think it is a little early to be giving this show any sort of long-term judgements. I think those with negative reviews should wait and see if the series gets better, and I think those with overly positive views should not be blind to the problems apparent so far with LWA. The viewer is given little to know where the plot is going, and depending on how the series deals with this and changes in the future, my opinion of this aspect could change. Right now, I think it detracts from the story, but maybe it won't when viewed as a whole. The animation isn't anything crazy, but in my opinion, it has a great art style, appealing aesthetic, and character design. The sound so far has not been exceptionally memorable, but the soundtrack definitely fits the feel of the series. I just feel like it's not very memorable because it's the exact kind of music you would expect from this kind of series. Besides the plot kind of going in not apparent direction, I'm overall really enjoying this series, and I think anyone can really enjoy this series if they can get used to the largely episodic format the series has taken on so far. I'm personally a fan of episodic anime (The Tatami Galaxy, Cowboy Bebop, Gintama, etc.), and I think if you are someone that is okay with the episodic format, you have the ability to really enjoy LWA. So far all of the episodes have given us fun adventures into the world of Luna Nova, and I think most of the episode plots have gone in really interesting and entertaining directions. Personally, I was hoping for something not as episodic from Trigger, like how they did with Kill la Kill, but I still have hopes that Little Witch Academia will get better and better as the season goes on.",

            "content": "Warning: There may be some spoilers here, I tried to clear all of them out of the way so there shouldn't be any. However, I don't know what one would or would not consider as a spoiler in corner cases.\r\nLittle Witch Academia is a show that wanted to have its cake and eat it too. It tried to do so much from Western Animation tropes and fluffy episodic episodes to a serious plot with the ramifications of the magic world up in the air. However that attempt to do so much is it's downfall as it ends up failing at each thing it tried. Whilethe art and animation were great as to be expected from Trigger, the actual writing under it was subpar and had a lot of problems. The biggest of which is: What is Little Witch Academia trying to do?\\n\\n\r\nIt starts off as an episodic show which very little that carries over from episode to episode. While there are hints of something important in the first episode they are mostly brushed aside to go with these episodic plots. And while one's mileage may vary on that, it leads to the first half of the show having a more Western Animation feel. Not only are there tropes ripped straight out of Western Animation, but the lack of solid progression of the characters and the story points towards this. However, in the middle of this Little Witch Academia brings up numerous subplots, including one big plot to drive the story. None of these are able to make a good impression, and even worse the plots don't fit together at all.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a grand words plot, which to me doesn't feel compelling. While I understand the reason for using those words I don't understand how one would be able to find out those words especially with the draconic language being so dead. How would one be able to find out the words? Furthermore is just knowing them enough or does it rely on strength of character? This is where the words plot falls apart for me. If knowing them is enough, it doesn't really matter what the character does and they would be better off just doing research. It makes for a lackluster story and could be done by anyone. That probably isn't the answer but if it is it points to an uncompelling narrative. If it's based on strength of character that means the rod can read that, and if the rod can read that, why does it need the words in the first place? The finding of the words feels useless when ultimately the rod should be able to tell the pure heart of its user.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's not the only problem. The other problem is Akko. Akko doesn't grow. At all. They even lampshade this late in the series. And while I like a good lampshade it fails to work when the thing being lampshaded is one of the key aspects of the plot. It's hard to take it seriously when the main character who is fixing everything is just as flat and flawed as she was in Episode 1. If the rod works off of strength of character, then what is it in Akko, a character will little character development, that resonated with the rod? In either case, the word plot doesn't work as a compelling narrative.\\n\\n\r\nNor does it really add much. While Chariot is one of the most developed characters the plot revolving around her isn't very interesting. Not to mention the plot doesn't do anything special. Despite teasing complex relations it never goes through on that. Whilethere was the chance to make the characters developed and interesting, they ended up falling back into flat cliche characters that fit exactly with what one would expect from their roles. \\n\\n\r\nWhile they had room to make the plot complex and show many different sides of an issue they elected not to do so. There were opportunities to flesh out Criox's character and give good reasons behind her motivations, and there was time to pay more attention to their dynamic, however rather than do that they made Criox completely and utterly evil. Everything she does is for her own gain, and whenever there is something wrong in the latter half it's always the fault of Criox. No matter what bad things happen in LWA somehow the root of that negative cause will be traced back to Croix. She is a cartoon villain except instead of LWA being a comedy, it's a more serious and magical story. The two don't fit together very well, as it's hard to take such an evil character seriously as a villain.\\n\\n\r\nTo make it worse Little Witch Academia can't commit. While the plot wasn't the best idea in the first place, they did have the time to be able to make it strong and shine. However instead of doing that they decided to split it up between all sorts of different subplots and episodic episodes, reducing the time that they had for the plot down to a point where it felt forced in and didn't resonate.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodic episodes weren't bad but they did lack a point. They were usually overstuffed with Western animation cliches to the point where there were moments that could have existed without them but instead had them shoved in for no good reason. In one particular episode, the start of it has Akko and friends getting caught doing something bad and as punishment, they have to study with a teacher on a weekend on the same day that Lotte has this convention that she really wants to go to. They sneak out and go to the convention, and then the fact that they snuck out was never brought up again until the very end of the episode. The trope of being forced to do something on an important day is very common in Western Animation, and its inclusion here isn't necessary as it's ignored for most of the episode. But because it's there it only murks up the episode with another cliche, that adds unnecessary and unrealised tension that distracts from the main focus of the episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe bigger problem with these episodes is that they don't develop the characters. Most of them focus on what the Character is already like or on comedy. That means while each episode can be entertaining they don't help the narrative as a whole. If Little Witch Academia was solely a collection of fun episodic episodes that wouldn't be that big of a problem. Even though they didn't hit anything big in them, it would be fine if isn't it wasn't designed to. And at the start, it felt like that's how it was. It was supposed to just be fun events that had happened. However it strives to do big things, and for those big things to work there needs to be developed. It's hard to take the plot seriously when the development of that plot is weak and cliche. It's hard to care about the characters in that plot when they aren't developed and are just flat archtypes. As these episodes rarely developed any other part of the show, and so even though Little Witch Academia had the space to fit together, it never actually worked because they never did so. Not only did the episodic episodes do a poor job of setting up the later plot heavy episodes but it also meant that switching the tone between the two would leave a stark difference between the two sides, possibly alienating the distinct styles of each side from each other.\\n\\n\r\nThat was not the only distraction. There were other uneventful plots such as Andrew's plot that ended up not going much of anywhere. His inclusion does not add much to the story, nor does it stand well on its own. Rather all it does is introduce another cliche subplot to take up space from the main plot which could have used the additional focus. Little Witch Academia did not need a love interest, nor did it need the another character's struggles to be present in the story, especially when that character's struggles are not focused on magic or the main themes of the work. His role also is played in the most cliche way possible played completely straight. He adds nothing new, and the show wouldn't be different at all without him. And yet he takes valuable episode space on his ultimately unimportant plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem is while the ideas aren't the worst they really don't work when put together. The plot-based elements aren't able to be explored nor do they have the intensity that they could have if they were focused on alone. Rather they feel more like afterthoughts that are shoved into the episodes. Often enough they don't even have enough time in those episodes and suffer from rushed pacing as well. They feel unnatural and with the exception of a couple of well-placed moments, they don't fit into the general tone of the show. Its the same with the episodic moments. They're fine on their own but the tone between the two parts don't fit together well. The episodic episodes are light and comedic, while the plot is more serious and important.\\n\\n\r\nI touched on the characters a bit and for good reason. The characters were a big problem in Little Witch Academia. Even though the characters did have moments of focus very few of them grew as characters. The characters were mostly the personalities that they established in their first appearances. They never seem to grow and they rarely get any depth. This is most critical is the case of Akko who is just as reckless and impatient as she was at the very start. Most of the characters follow this same pattern though. The best character they have is Diana who actually developed and showed more interesting sides to her outside of her know it all role. She is able to express the conflicting feelings between her interest in magic, as well as her interest in tradition and her family history. However, even her strong points are countered by the fact of just how talented she is. Even though she has the most interesting struggles of the show, she happens to be incredibly talented and respected to a degree that stretches believability. Outside of Chariot the rest of the characters aren't very developed and Chariot has the same problems with being too talented although not on the same scale as Diana. Overall the characters don't add much, as most are flat, and the more developed ones are overpowered.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd it's not like the character interactions save it either. While some characters like Akko and Diana have natural chemistry this isn't the case with most of them. Even though there are other friendship groups besides Akko's most of the attention focuses on Akko with whomever else the episode decides on. And while there are moments that bring Lotte and Sucy closer to Akko, they also barely even appear together after the second half. Their friendship also feels a bit forced as even though the show does say that Sucy cares about Akko it's hard to believe that considering how they generally treat each other. The combination of the weak characters and awful mess of a plot makes a crap filled wreck.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily for Little Witch Academia, it is very pretty. The art is very nice, and the animation is fluid and works really well. It's a nice feast for the eyes. It also does well at building and animating hype moments. But that's about it. It also has a good deal of references and sequences designed to draw the attention of the fans. While these are not bad in nature, when they are inserted into the more serious moments of the show, it does hurt the moment.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Little Witch Academia works for the eyes, it doesn't work on any other merit, and overall is a large undeveloped mess. If it wasn't for the nice Trigger style I'd call this one of the worst shows of the season. Actually, it still is. Unless you just want to tune out and watch nice visuals I suggest giving this a hard pass.",

            "content": "A believing heart is your magic \u2013 with Little Witch Academia, Trigger furnishes something so enchantingly brilliant in its simplicity and heartfelt resonance, executes every detail with the utmost bliss, and ultimatley drowns the viewer in a recurring feeling of wonder; unto the conclusion that a believing heart can amount to nothing more and nothing less than that certain thing we all hope for but can't quite materialize.\r\nI realized I was in for a treat as the first episode ended and I was already wholeheartedly immersed in the characters and lore, which is a fleetingly rare way to feel one episode into such an admittedlyaccessible and light-hearted series. I realized this anime was something special during the final scene of the third episode, as Akko looked on as a Shooting Star took flight, or so to speak. In the briefest of moments, Little Witch Academia gracefully painted the most beautiful picture of the essence of everything magic is, all the hopes and dreams it embodies, and all the unduly weight, whether ethical or relating to personal growth, it can hold in such a fantastical world. It achieved this without even a hint of dialogue, but that\u2019s not to say Little Witch is something pretentiously rooted in an aversion to exposition, it just knows when a visual narrative is better suited than a verbal one, and vice versa. I realized this anime was most assuredly going to be my favorite series to air in years during the twelveth episode, when Akko was shown a vision of Chariot's youth; full of relatable blunders and missteps, but also joy in the purest form. Akko saw herself resonating in the the tumults of her idol, and through this she understood the cost of her dream, but more than that, she began to question her dream. Was it even her dream at all, or just the willfull embrace of another's dream that she sought to grasp onto with all her might? I realized Little Witch Academia was something bordering on truly great during the sixteenth episode, as Akko trudged through a snowy night on her lonesome in a desperate bid to save her friends, but never without her relentlessly believing heart beckoning her on and on. Reckless, unabashedly silly and floundering as she is, Akko never abandons her heart. She questions herself, becomes enveloped by doubt in her own innate ability on a regular basis, and struggles with her self-identify alongside the overcast shadow of Shiny Chariot and her opulent brilliance. But what is adversity to the human spirit? (Cue the plethora of Gurren Lagann parallels).\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is full but never overly packed; Akko\u2019s compatriots all undergo their own trials and tribulations in a magical youth. Lotte blossoms into a confident aspiring witch from a timid and insecure young girl, whilst dealing with her own passions and dreams. Amanda grows from a delinquent to a warmer and more joyful person as Akko helps her battle against the price of perception. Andrew sheds the predeterminations of his upbringing to the tune of his own destiny. Diana, in particular, experiences a journey of personal growth rivaling Akko, literally and figuratively, as she grapples with the desire to fulfill everyone else\u2019s immaculate expectations for her future, against her own aspirations. But behind her fa\u00e7ade of flawlessness, Diana also struggles with pettiness and jealousy, which cleverly mirrors the main antagonist\u2019s own conflicted youth, yet she seeks to avoids a similar folly through the kindness of others and her own stoically altruistic tendencies.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia, simply put, has it all. Action, adventure, humour, tragedy. A captivating soundtrack befitting of the series's dynamic tone. Fantastical world building transpiring in the midst of a surprisingly relatable coming of age story. Hopes, the shadows they cast. Sorrow, and the malice it begets. Friendship, family, a penultimate story that delves into the potentially questionable integration of technology into our lives, and even a dash of romance. These various elements and directions all synthesize into a breathtaking typhoon of a final episode in which Trigger accomplishes everything that should have been acheived in the Kill La Kill finale, but wasn't, and unequivocally more, because while less ambitious in scope, Little Witch wondrously surpasses Kill La Kill in depth, and it does so on a much more profound level.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch attains a tremendous dichotomy between innocence and sin, and it does so without ever compromising its cheerful composition. This is something not seen often in the medium, or any television medium for that matter, as so many series tend to spiral down a path of ever-directionless developments in an attempt to double down on the seriousness they wish to hone in on. Fun characters and happy endings are so typically cast aside in favor of gratuitous darkness; and fun series are so typically averse to achieving realism in spite of their fantasy, almost too intimated at the daunting prospect of creating something timelessly relatable and enjoyable to even make an effort. Trigger shoot for the stars with Little Witch Academia, as they always do (to mixed results), and at last they reach their luminous destination after the wildest of rides.\\n\\n\r\nEvery motif and achievement in Little Witch can be translated to the real world upon equating what magic represents, to what the human spirit is and can be. Romanticized as it may be, the human spirit is infinite and life is geniunely whatever you make it. Little Witch articulates this through the hopes and dreams of its characters and how they relate to the convictions within their hearts. A person's actions can bely their hopes and dreams, but that is not to say hopes and dreams are so sedentary that they won't spring up when you least expect them to.\\n\\n\r\nYet, when all is said and done, Little Witch Academia doesn\u2019t achieve artistic excellence via all of the above. It does so much more ephemerally, it does so simply and with solace, it does so with marvel and intrigue, it does so with everything it is and everything it does and everything it can be. Little Witch Academia is mesmerizing because it transforms magic into a believing heart.\\n",

            "content": "\"Believing is your Magic\" ~ Little Witch Academia (2017)\r\nTL;DR: at the very end\r\nHas Trigger saved Anime one more time? what does mean to save Anime?\r\nmeanwhile other anime studios makes their generic money maker without taking any risk, there goes Trigger risking it all and making Jewels and Masterpieces that goes beyond your imagination, see? there is no need to use generic settings and overused troupes just to get gold from a goldmine. there is another big gold mine called \"imagination\" and this is how Little Witch Academia from Trigger, saves the anime one more time! want to know more? then bring up some popcorn andrelax, because Little Witch Academia is one hell of a ride with lot to offer to its watchers.\\n\\n\r\nWarning: if you are an OVA/Movie Fanboy that didn't like this series because they aren't like the OVA/Movie, then fuck off, because neither the OVA or the movie matters here, this is a 100% original anime from the hands of TRIGGER. also bewary of spoilers\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nohh were to Start? Little witch academia goes around Atsuko Kagari (AKA Akko) a girl that always cherished Magic from the bottom of her heart. her dream to become a Witch and spread happiness to the world started when she saw a Live magic show from \"Shiny Chariot\". with that on her mind, she decided to go to \"Luna Nova\" the magic school where Shiny Chariot assisted in order to become a powerful and incredible witch just as Shiny Chariot was, and maybe she could meet her Idol. sadly, there is one big problem Akko has, she isn't very good with magic, and for some reason is very difficult for her to use magic or even to fly on a broom. this way, she gets to meet Sucy and Lotte, 2 witches that helps her to reach Luna Nova, but on the attempt something happens and they fall over a pretty dangerous forest, and right here, starts the adventure of our favorite Witch: Akko\\n\\n\r\nAfter finding the Shiny Rod, and dealing with the dangers inside the dangerous forest, Ursula-sensei appears and tells Akko some magical words that Akko must cast in order to use the Shiny Rod and save their asses, teleporting everyone into Luna Nova (also falling in the middle of the ceremony) and that summarizes the introduction of this show\\n\\n\r\nit might become boring and frustrating after this point, because the very first episodes are mostly dedicated to slice of life, character development and character introductions (might be the reason why so many people gave up on this show, they basically didn't want Trigger to save Anime) but after a while, they get us into the main plot of the show, which is to restore magic with the power of the \"words\" that Akko must find and cast, Akko, and only Akko, because she was the one chosen to do the task. each single \"word\" has a major meaning to magic and the show itself, since most of them comes from the bottom of the heart, from that heart that stills believe in magic, that heart that won't give up no matter what, but Akko must find first the meaning of each single word in order to cast them, once that happens, the Shiny rod will shine and cast the most beautiful magic you're going to see, I'm pretty sure you don't want to lose such an marvelous watch like that\\n\\n\r\nas for how much this show has to offer, there are a lot of secrets that most of magic holds, and the witches itself. secrets that might make you happy, sad, hyped, Yay +100000000000 or Yay -100000000000, even references to other anime (Specially from Trigger itself)\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: \\n\\n\r\nfrom this point I think that people is retarded, I've seen a lot of people complaining because the animation sucks... are they blind? what anime did they watch? because the animation of this show is TRULY a WORK OF ART, there is almost no usage of CG animation, which makes it even better when it comes to animate huge things and action scenes with a lot of movement, or even scenes that are tranquil but the animation quality makes up for it to deliver a gorgeous experience and keeps you hooked into it while you have your mouth open wide as how beautiful it looks. completely refreshing and gorgeous, even the animation of the OP and ED are really well done and makes a good resonance with the Sound department. \\n\\n\r\nif what people criticizes here is by any means some derpy looking faces, then they should just jump off from a bridge, because how the hell will you expect to have good looking faces most of the time, while spending a lot of budget into great and beautiful scenes? or would they like to see no derpy faces while having bad choreography at action scenes or gorgeous scenes?\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nI didn't got attracted to the first OP and ED, yet they were quite good overall, but nothing compares to the second OP and ED that are simply beautiful with 2 excellent songs that hyped me even more (specially the Ending that is really beautiful, or in the Opening where Chariot and Croix appears as Akko and Diana faces against each other)\\n\\n\r\nthe whole cast of seiyuus on this anime did a great job (heartbreaking me of course) but I didn't find myself hating any character by their voice or anything like that, in fact, having one character just making some noises (Constanze) makes it really cute. and lets not forget about the soundtrack of the anime itself, it just not only makes a good resonance with the Art department, it delivers the feels it has to deliver to your ears, call it eargasm if you want. but the whole OST is lovely\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10:\\n\\n\r\noh boy, one of the biggest appeals of this show is their characters cast, it can have some generic characters, Like Amanda or Diana (the bully and the \"perfect\" in this case) but their development is really like REALLY great, and guess what? all that development greatness happens because of Akko's greatness and invincible will to believe in magic. just like Simon Believed in the Simon that believes in himself on TTGL, that kind of power, the power that made Simon a Man. its the same power that made Akko a great character that influences those that are around her, making them great characters in the progress. even more as we get to know about their past and reasons (for example Diana, Ursula and Akko) with a really heartbreaking connection that explains everything, that and how each single one of them supports Akko, its like they got \"Akkoided\" hahaha understand? \"Akkoided\", I know, I'm really bad at jokes\\n\\n\r\nlets not forget about Chumlee or that dude that looks a lot like that History channel show of \"Pawn Stars\" (mostly known in spanish memes as \"No lo s\u00e9 Rick Parece falso\")\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nafter losing my faith into anime with your typical seasonal generic garbage, and seeing how some great jewels gets underrated because they don't have anything like boobs bouncing or something like that. Little Witch Academia and Triggers delivers and my faith has been restored. Trigger has saved anime one more time with a gorgeous fantasy world of magic that is really appealing with a heart touching story that will make you believe in magic\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: \\n\\n\r\nI'm not implying that you will mostly likely love this show, that depends on you yourself, and no one else, not even my review. that belongs on your sole experience while watching this anime. if you like it, then welcome to the club, if you don't then just pass away. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Trigger saves anime, Witches earns the love of their watchers while showing off gorgeous animation, great characters, great soundtrack, original ideas, and the power of believing in magic\\n\\n\r\nI would like a second season now... please Trigger ;~;\\n\\n",

            "content": "Those who watched the movie shorts of Little Witch Academia and expect to get the TV series to expand upon them would be sadly disappointed. The series does not seem to have a canonical connection to the previous movie shorts but rather starts fresh so you're not missing out on anything.\r\nIn the series we follow the main character Atsuko Kagari's (Akko) daily mischief with her friends and roommates Sucy and Lotte. Akko is a normal girl, not born a witch thus isn't naturally able to use magic without properly taught. Akko dreams of becoming a great witch like her idol Shiny Chariot. This is atypical underdog character setup. A character you root for to overcome all odds and difficulties and ultimately achieving their dream. Sadly from the first few episodes you progressively feel less and less inclined to root for her because of how little she is willing to learn or develop. \\n\\n\r\nThe episodes follow a simple pattern of introducing a problem to be solved at the end of the episode. The problem usually caused by either Akko or Sucy or both dragging Lotte along with them. \\n\\n\r\nSucy is a questionable friend and would risk breaking any school rules to get what she wants. \\n\\n\r\nLotte is the third wheel of the group. Her contribution usually consist of ignored warnings to Akko or Sucy to stop or not do something stupid and against the rules. \\n\\n\r\nAkko is the protagonist and she fails miserably at being likable. She is rash and impatient and doesn't think things through which drags her friends or the people around her intro trouble (which she never bothers apologizing for) she caused which most of the time is of serious nature (like raising the dead) but this show, being aimed at young teens nobody would actually die or get seriously hurt. You'd expect a harsh punishment for such misuse of magic and defying the authorities and the school rules but Akko and her friends are laid off with a less sever punishment because expelling them would mean the end of the show. This is where show falls flat as it uses that as an excuse for Akko or Sucy to do any kind of mischief as they desire without any real consequences.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is enjoyable for its art and quirky tone and simple plot of longing for the golden age of magic but the main characters fall flat as merely actors for the current episode rather than contentiously developing even if little episode by episode. There is never fear for anything to seriously dampen the mode not even as little as a fight or disagreement between friends.",

In order to accomplish her dreams, she enrols in Luna Nova, an wizard academy to where her idol went and one of the most prestigios.\r\nStory: Trigger follows its Kill la Kill formula with a first part that's mostly episodic, rarely moving the plot forwards, and with a basic objective the MC has to follow. KlK, nonetheless, executed it better. LWA tried to build around its characters with some very successful episodes and other somewhat boring, \"fillerish\". However, when the second part kicksin, it does with full force and it payoffs greatly.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound: Trigger does what it does best, with some breathtaking backgrounds and a great soundtrack. The way it plays homage to other animations styles is beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Much like the plot, characters at first may seem annoying, specially Akko, since she often tries to do things her way. Nonetheless it is easy to get attached to her, specially near the end of the anime. The rest of the cast is enjoyable, with girls like Sucy and Amanda that introduce a lot of fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a very fun anime full of awe and magic. Little Witch Academia keeps the \"Trigger saved anime\" meme on and I hope this isn't the end of the story of Luna Nova.",

            "content": "1966: Mitseteru Yokoyama, inspired by the Japanese popularity of the US sitcom \u2018Bewitched\u2019, created a little Anime called \u2018Sally the Witch\u2019 about a young girl from a magical kingdom who came to earth and used her magic to help with the troubles of the world. This now sadly obscure title would go on to be highly influential in leading to the creation of the \u2018Cute Witch\u2019 genre, which would go on to be a subgenre for a much larger genre, the \u2018Magical Girl\u2019 genre.\r\n1969: \u2018Secrets of Akko-chan\u2019 would expand upon the Magical Girl genre by introducing elements such as shapeshifting, and instead of involving agirl born with magic, involving an ordinary, relatable human character who attains such abilities.\\n\r\n1970: Osamu Tezuka\u2019s \u2018Marvellous Melmo\u2019 further expanded the realms of the genre, intending it for an older generation of young girls than previous titles in the genre had been by implementing the mature themes of other Tezuka works.\\n\r\n1973: The most revolutionary title of its time, \u2018Cutey Honey\u2019 introduced concepts such as the Magical Warrior Girl, an influence of American Superhero comics. It also introduced the transformation sequence which has since been a staple of the genre. Additonally, its provocative and unapologetic fanservice made it one of the few magical girl titles that appealed to men and women, as well as one of the first aimed specifically towards an adult audience which would mould into the growing Otaku fan culture.\\n\r\n1975: \u2018Meg the Witch Girl\u2019 introduced the dark magical girl genre with a series  involving domestic violence, substance abuse, extramarital relationships, and a politically charged mythos which introduced the Queen/Conquest element to the genre.\\n\r\n1980s: A decade in which Studio Pierrot effectively dominated the genre saw an increased focus on commercialisation to the now established Otaku subculture, as well as an increased focus on Magical Girl team dynamics.\\n\r\n1992: Naoko Takeuchi\u2019s Genre defining \u2018Sailor Moon\u2019 became the first  Magical Girl series to really break through into the West, becoming by far the most popular entry in the genre, and making the Magical Warrior the definitive face of Magical Girls. A series which embraced each trope of the genre (messages of love and hope, cute animal sidekicks, aimed towards a primarily female audience, elements which could be considered more Sci-Fi than Fantasy) to influence the likes of \u2018Precure\u2019 and \u2018Wedding Peach\u2019, but also had a compelling mythos and likeable cast of characters which causes it to still resonate with many to this day in a way that previous entries in the genre had not.\\n\r\n1998: \u2018Cardcaptor Sakura\u2019, the most minimalist and subversive entry in the genre up to that point bridged the gap between \u2018Cute Witches\u2019 and \u2018Magical Warriors\u2019 by including aspects of both genres, as well as mixing in Slice of Life elements.\\n\r\n2003: A 3 episode OVA remake of \u2018Cutey Honey\u2019 co-produced between Toei and Gainax saw a more self-aware, stylized interpretation of the genre, which was particularly notable due to its outlandish, fast-paced animation style which in part can be attributed to the Key Animation of Hiroyuki Imaishi who would go on to direct \u2018Gurren Lagann\u2019, and of course found Studio Trigger with fellow Gainax key-animator You Yoshinari who held much of the same kinetic animation style.\\n\r\n2011: Following a decade of increased evaluation on the genre in titles such as 2002\u2019s \u2018Princess Tutu\u2019 and \u2018Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha\u2019 which branched out beyond the trappings of the genre, perhaps the most well-known subversion to the genre came with Gen Urobuchi\u2019s \u2018Puella Magi Madoka Magica\u2019, an extremely dark, psychological Magical Girl series which looked  at the traumatic side of being a Magical Warrior. This anime would prove to have an enduring popularity which resulted in an increased market of Dark Magical Girl series such as the \u2018Wixoss\u2019 franchise and \u2018Magical Girl Raising Project\u2019\\n\r\n2013: In the midst of this backdrop of dark series came Studio Trigger\u2019s crowdfunded debut feature, a 25 minute OVA titled \u2018Little Witch Academia\u2019, a \u2018Cute Witch\u2019 piece which endeared to a large audience with its likeable cast of characters, establishment of story threads which set up for potential continuations, and the Imaishi inspired high-energy and inventive animation style that would go on to define  Trigger\u2019s other works. It\u2019s popularity of course then launched a sequel OVA, and a television series. The LWA project has resultantly become Trigger\u2019s primary selling franchise, similar to Type Moon adaptations for Ufotable, or \u2018One Piece\u2019 for Toei.\\n\r\nFall 2016: A new subversion to the genre came in \u2018Flip Flappers\u2019 where rather than darkness, abstract surrealism which from a superficial perspective provide entertaining eye candy, and from an analytical perspective provides an intellectually stimulating observation on art and philosophy. Neither interpretation is wrong, but for the purposes of this review I will say it\u2019s enjoyability is more relevant, as the series presented an alternative to series like \u2018Magical Girl Raising Project\u2019 the same season through its upbeat happiness.\\n\r\n2017: Coming immediately off the heels of \u2018Flip Flappers\u2019, the \u2018Little Witch Academia\u2019 tv series can be seen a confirmative shift away from the seemingly overpowering influx of darker Magical Girl series as of late with the series\u2019 positive and upbeat attitude. Whereas \u2018Flip Flappers\u2019 had an abstract nature which caused it to go outside the Magical Girl genre however, \u2018LWA\u2019 is a Magical Girl series through and through, and is proud of that fact.\\n\\n\r\nOk, I apologise for that extremely long intro, but I decided to make that to service the point that I wish to make in this review. The simple version of it is that \u2018LWA\u2019s appeal stems from it being fun. The greater version of it is that there is more to it than simply \u201cfun\u201d, or that the \u201cfun\u201d of it holds an even higher emotional resonance for its audience. That it expertly creates a work of escapist fantasy which is exactly what the average anime fan is looking for, a goal which is reflected in its trademark Trigger style and expansion of what was established in the two OVAs.\\n\r\nTo gain a proper understanding of the series, one should certainly watch the two OVAs before giving the tv series a shot, as although it does begin at a point chronologically before them, there are multiple references and call-backs to them which require prior knowledge. As a magical girl series, \u2018LWA\u2019 feels very much like a reconstruction of the genre, with a premise which takes it back to its roots in the concept of \u2018Cute Witches doing Cute things\u2019, and while the witches in question certainly are cute, it also reverses that age-old concept in having Akko be an ordinary human who discovers the wonders of the witch world, as opposed to Sally who was a witch discovering humanity. This restoration, in addition to giving the series a unique place in a modern market dominated by the warrior subgenre, also allows for us, the audience, to experience this world through Akko\u2019s eyes.\\n\r\nAkko Karagi very much makes this series what it is, with her upbeat and excitable attitude matching the overall tone of the show fluently. Her desire to be achieve greatness in spite of her shortcomings and her stubborn nature and her relentless misdemeanour makes her a compelling and greatly relatable character who in equal parts is able to provide moments of comedic relief and incredible sympathy. Of course, this is all stuff we\u2019ve before in the OVA, but what is unique to this series is the way in which her character grows and develops, as the timespan of 25 episodes allows for a large length of time for her development of her powers to feel authentic and realistic, while also slow enough that one can\u2019t help but cheer when she finally succeeds in using them in episode 13. Akko is essentially us, the audience, the Otaku. The way that she looks up to Chariot reflects how many of us look up to our favourite Anime characters and how she sees value in what is essentially intended as merely a piece of escapist entertainment in Chariot's performances.\\n\r\nThe other characters previously seen are great also, Lotte is still the wise and humble voice of reason in Akko\u2019s trio, Sucy, despite not going through any real development, does display her delightful eccentricities and hints that she cares more greatly for her friends than she is willing to openly admit. The greatest achievement of the cast however would have to Diana Cavendish, or Best Girl Diana, who goes through a significant development throughout the series. Many of us remember her from the OVAs as a snobbish and selfish antagonist to Akko, but the series highlights why she acts the way she does, as we learn more about her life and her personal situation. Although she seems stubborn towards Akko, she truly does care the wellbeing of the other students and like Akko hopes to prove herself. It is through her interactions with Akko that the quality of the writing shines brightest, as the success of Akko\u2019s brash actions initially alienate her, but eventually helps her, causing the two to grow a closer bond with one another and eventually developing something resembling a friendship when they learn that they have more in common than they initially believed, note the festival scene at the beginning where you may notice a certain someone.\\n\r\nWhen I described the series as \u2018escapist\u2019 earlier, I was referring to how it is able to embellish such a feeling of positivity in the viewer. This is reflected in many ways throughout the series, one such way is in how its world is presented. The series is split into two halves, with the first being an episodic, largely character and comedy driven series focusing more on character development than story progression, while the second half is more plot driven. While story elements such as Akko\u2019s quest for the seven words to restore magic to the world and find her hero, Shiny Chariot, permeates through the whole series, the amount of time we have allows the writers to present a fully fleshed out world. This is particularly noticeable when we see the ordinary world where technology has largely replaced magic, and the conflict this presents to Luna Nova Academy. The concept of Magic becoming obsolete by way of technology is one that I can\u2019t think of having been done in any other work of fiction before, so it is an interesting direction to take, bringing to the forefront the theme of traditionalism vs modernity, which we are able to view the multiple facets of, whether they be the stern and traditionalist attitudes of the Luna Nova elite, or the prejudiced attitudes of the modern world. The series never tries to take a side, as our main character opts for a middle ground in this conflict, though the series even confronts itself on that front when the main villain, Croix, takes such a position (seemingly, at least).\\n\r\nThis applies to one of the key themes of \u2018LWA\u2019, the idea that nothing exists in absolute terms. Sticking to the ways of old are clearly not working out entirely well for the Academy, but the negatives of life in the outside world are also emphasised, with many obvious references to real world political events such as football riots, racism, and the epidemic of internet trolling towards Yetis (and you thought this series was just \u201cfun\u201d). Yeah, I wasn\u2019t expecting to see stuff like that from this franchise. In case you\u2019re worried the series gets too political, you needn\u2019t worry as, in keeping with that theme, the story never allows one side of itself to completely take over, thus this aspect is left primarily as an interesting backdrop. It is also reflected in the tone of the series, and some of the criticisms that I have seen. The first half of the series received some criticism for lacking story progression in favour of humour, while to a lesser extent some have also criticised the second half for being overly serious. I respectfully disagree with these viewpoints, as I feel that while the second half did indeed give us dramatic moments (well executed ones at that), they never reached too overboard with it or tried to become too melodramatic. The first half meanwhile did still see some story progression, particularly in the excellent episode 6.\\n\r\nThis theme is once again examined in the characters, many of whom at first may appear to be unlikeable, but we grow to like them more as the series progresses and they are shown to have more dimensions to them. Dianna is the most obvious example of this, but in one scene we even see this change in her two sidekicks when they thank Akko for jmgjb cvvnjkhf (spoilers). The new character of Andrew Hanbridge, a male non-magical equivalent of Dianna who holds society prejudices towards witchcraft, believing it to be an outdated tradition, but eventually grows to respect them through his experience with Akko, whom he initially takes a disliking to, but comes to hold a certain admiration for. Or in the sterner leadership of Luna Nova\u2019s professor Finnelann, who ends up helping towards the climax. Even our main villain is shown to have a tragic and sympathetic backstory and is given a chance for redemption towards the end.\\n\r\nIf I must dispel with some negatives towards the series, I would say that while I wasn\u2019t as bothered by the series pacing as most people were, the episodic nature of the series did hurt it in some places, such as when we get an episode which is mostly filler gets in the way between some significant story progression. One example of this for me would be episode 5, which I found to be a rather dull episode, lacking the series\u2019 usual kinetic activity. Though I say mostly because even episodes such as this have something in them which does add to the series such as this episode being the one which introduced the technology conflict. Another thing is that being stretched across 25 episodes, the animation quality takes a significant downgrade from the OVAs, and can often feel a bit lacking in some areas. Finally, I would add that despite the length of the series, there are still some story elements which are left underdeveloped towards the end, such as the secret society of witch hunters from episode 18, or the fact that Lotte and Sucy, despite being Akko\u2019s closest friends and getting their own individual episodes, do end up taking a backseat in numerous incidents. Yoshinari has expressed interest in creating a second season, and it feels like some elements were left in the dark to serve as potential sequel bait, though considering the question of whether a second season will come to fruition it does feel like a bit of a shame that the series doesn\u2019t end on a conclusive note.\\n\r\nThat said though, the series we got was great. It was magical. Despite the animation taking a downgrade, it does still imbue Trigger\u2019s trademark energy throughout, displaying a brilliant mix of speed and visual cohesion in the displays of magic in the series, with the highlight being a fast-paced broom race in episode 3. It additionally features visual influences of Disney cartoons and 70s Shoujo series, as well as multiple references of other works such as \u2018Star Wars\u2019 and \u2018Evangelion\u2019 (this is a Trigger work after all). I am also a fan of the decision to have the second ED be computer animated to reflect the shift in focus towards technology.\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the magic also shines through in Michiru Oshima\u2019s soundtrack. The Main theme and its variants are always a delight to listen to, whether it is the triumphant, loud rendition which plays during some of the series more visually spectacular moments, the lowkey version played during some of the more laid back, comedic moments, or the slow and quiet rendition played in the series\u2019 more sombre and intimate moments. Being an Oshima soundtrack, it also incorporates elements of world influences, such as a Celtic track serving as the accompaniment of the series\u2019 deeper mythos (it has a legitimately interesting mythos btw) or a soft, winterlike piano melody which we alongside the \u2018search for Akko\u2019 scene late in the series, those who\u2019ve seen it know what I\u2019m referring to.\\n\r\nOne word that I don\u2019t think a lot of people will really bring to mind when thinking about this series is \u201cbalance\u201d, as people wouldn\u2019t normally associate high-octane Trigger-ism with that word. But I for one think that it does accurately describe \u2018LWA\u2019 as it\u2019s episodic nature, despite being a negative in some areas, is a strength for the majority of the time, as it expertly expands upon the world established in the two OVAs. I\u2019ve barely even mentioned the story of Ursula in this review, though I will say that it provides one of the great student-teacher duos in a year full of such duos. It all feels exactly like Yoshinari had planned this from the very beginning, and to see this long running, crowd-funded project come to fruition is truly a sight to behold. The fact that it does so while also providing a great escapist experience for our troubled times, reflecting those troubled times in the backdrop, and displays a multi-faceted and nuanced mythos and cast of characters makes the series a definite success, as well as an effective reconstruction of the fun side of Magical Girl series, and definitely one of my favourite Anime of the year.\\n\r\nTL;DR: \u2018Little Witch Academia\u2019 is utterly magical! The character are magical! The setting is magical! The style is Magical! The series represents all of Trigger\u2019s best qualities as a studio, and stands as possibly their strongest work to date, as well as serving as a fun dose of Magical Girl entertainment with a broad appeal. This right here, is why we watch Anime, because at the end of the day, it\u2019s fun!",

            "content": "As a fan of the original OVAs I really, really wanted to like this series. Unfortunately, every week brings another disappointment.  I greatly enjoyed the first episode, the broom race episode and the episode centered around Sucy, but beyond those I struggled not to feel massively let down.\r\nStory:\r\nEvery episode seems like a run-on sentence, with no finesse to speak of. In one episode, dragons steal the sorcerer's stone, they try to get it back, the dragons are robots being controlled by an actual dragon who's an investor that the academy owes money to, Diana shows up and is conveniently the only person who canread dragon ruins and the contract is voided. what??\\n\\n\r\nThere are also a lot of completely irrelevant Chekhov's guns that go absolutely nowhere. For example, the episode Night Fall. The episode opens with a focus on Lotte talking to someone named BigBen on her crystal ball/computer, planning to meet up at the Night Fall event. She mentions BigBen a few other times in the episode, building our expectations for their encounter. However, once they meet, BigBen has absolutely zero relevance to the plot, and simply disappears. There are many other poorly planned and irrelevant inclusions like this throughout the series. Also, things that should have been included but weren't. Example: episode 14, the faeries who maintain the school go on strike. What faeries?? if they're so integral to the school's ability to function, maybe they should have been shown or mentioned at least once!\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art and animation is also very disappointing. I understand that a 25 episode series can't maintain the same level of quality as the OVAs, but the shots are just plain awful at every turn. Most scenes consist of the characters standing around talking with a bare-bones background. In an anime about a magic academy, world building is crucial. The environment should be magical in and of itself, or at least not completely barren and bland. There are also plenty of careless mistakes. In episode 14, Lotte and Akko are standing in a field. Two teachers show up. Suddenly, Sucy is there, as if she'd been there all along. It's a far cry from what I've come to expect from Studio Trigger.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n-Way too Akko-centric\\n\r\n-why are the teachers so incompetent\\n\r\n-why has Sucy been reduced to a background piece who spouts bad one-liners\\n\r\n-why is Diana so good at everything, where did her secret dorky side go\\n\r\n-if they spent the first 13 episodes on world-building and character development episodes, why aren't any of the characters developed and why isn't the world built\\n\r\n-a disappointing lack of cute character moments, like when Sucy turned Akko's hair into a plant\\n\r\n-why doesn't Sucy use her arms???\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I had hoped this show would be cute, fun, and have a careful amount of detail put into developing these beloved characters. Instead, it's a completely disjointed slapped-together mess. It seems as if the writers are misunderstanding what makes a magic school such an enchanting premise. I wanted to like it so badly, but I can't pretend that I'm not incredibly disappointed.",

There are no villains, only character conflicts based on ideals and traits.\r\nI am very glad to see magic in a TV show be used for something other than killing.

So you shouldn't really look at the score, but the subjective comments of the reviews, unless of course you're looking for some sort of miraculous master piece.\r\nFull:\r\nAnyways, to actually review the show. It isn't mind-boggling, out of this world, amazingly unique, or any of the like. Although, it does one thing and one thing right. It knows it's a rather tropey, cliche show about an underdog in a magical world full of great things. And it doesn't shy away from that, rather itbuilds itself on being that. It doesn't try to add a twist that doesn't make sense, to simply put it, it's a well made show that does its job, which is being an innocent show about a young girl trying to become her idol, obliviously becoming the best damn witch in the world. The plot isn't anything it shouldn't be and is treated well, and set-up neatly. The world building is great, the show manages to give you a peer into the world without it being too forced or too shy. The music is amazing as expected. Characters are all unique, and follow their cliche archetypes well and greatly. Art is definitely something else compared to normal anime with it being somewhat westernized.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\r\nSo in conclusion, this isn't gonna solve world hunger or anything, it simply delivers on being a really well-rounded show. The hype is definitely gonna be a misleading factor to viewers who aren't fans. But if you are thinking of watching this, this is the kind of show older fans in anime would most probably like, if you're sick of all the random nonsensical stories where everything feels drawn-out or weird. It does its job well of being the magical world of a young girl trying to do her best. Overall great show to enjoy",

            "content": "If any fans of the original Little Witch Academia film or fans of its sequel The Enchanted Parade are reading this review and are worried about this TV adaptation holding up to the standard of its progenitors, allow me to lay your fears to rest. Little Witch Academia TV is GREAT. It is a worthy successor in every way to the movies that generated so much interest, but at the same time no knowledge of the two films is necessary to enjoy this new TV anime. The show is fun, light, and heartwarming, and I will confidently recommend it to anyone who is even slightlyinterested.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Exemplary of what anime can be. Every frame is beautifully rendered in a way that looks both meticulous and full of love of the craft.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good but unremarkable, although the OP is cute and the ED is gorgeously drawn.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Harry Potter in an all-girls school. Some unlikely misfit friends come together in a school for witches, and learn who they are and what they can do along the way. The tone is light, the challenges they face are believable within the world, and the story is driven by real-seeming characters with genuine interactions. As the series progresses a more serious plot begins to develop, which casts the light-hearted adventures taking place in a more serious light. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Unequivocally the high point of the show, even more so than the stellar art. The side characters are all great in their own right, but the main three are really the best that Little Witch Academia has to offer. Main character Akko is a perfect blend of annoying and endearing, and she sucks at magic just enough to act as an audience surrogate without being irritating about it. She is also a curious mix of plucky idiot and self-centered asshole in a way that really shouldn't work but somehow does anyway. Lotte, the most reserved member of the main cast, is the perfect balance of chill to Akko's complete lack thereof. Her presence really grounds the cast as a whole, as she is the most \"normal\" character of the bunch. Sucy, the third of the main characters and hands down my favorite, is a joy to watch. She is cynical, sarcastic, borderline evil, and a perfect wild card to pull the group into and out of danger with her dangerous potions and even more dangerous lack of safety standards. Episode 8, which is mostly about Sucy, is one of the best episodes of an anime I have seen in years. All in all, a great group of characters on which to focus our story.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is great. Watching it makes me feel good, which is really all I want in a lighthearted anime like this. It is funny, serious, and heartwarming by turns, and is always presented in a way that makes me want to be a part of the world it depicts. Fans of Harry Potter, fans of the preceding two films, and anime fans in general should not miss this show, and I would not be surprised if it turns out to be overall one of the best shows of 2017.",

            "content": "[7.5/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nA testament to the episodic format, Little Witch Academia is, at least in the first half, closer to a Saturday-morning cartoon from the west than it is any anime that I've seen. It made me nostalgic. Nostalgic to moments, years ago, which I hardly even remember. The lazy, early mornings, having a hand resting on my shoulder slowly pushing me awake. My eyes fluttering open and the sight of a loved one telling me to get my breakfast. Running down the stairs and being greeted by a bowl of cereal and my favorite cartoon. \r\nPut frankly, the first thirteen or so episodes of Little WitchAcademia were exactly as wonderful as \"The Enchanted Parade.\" This first half was the most wholesome and enjoyable experience I had in anime since I watched Nichijou. It felt as though, through my older eyes, I was thrust into a new, quirky world that I got to uncover through the images shown and through the experiences of our protagonist. It was so rewarding to appreciate the intricacies that Trigger is known for, the tiny details that would ultimately go unnoticed by anyone who isn't keenly paying attention for them. \\n\\n\r\nThe utterly amazing character designs which I praised endlessly in my \"Enchanted Parade\" review. The wonderful, lively, eccentric character animation that fully breathed life into every soul that enters Luna Nova. So much so that recurring tertiary characters were often more memorable than the majority of secondary characters in other shows. While the series didn't have the kind of consistent animation of the OVA's, what I really enjoyed were the few episodes that clearly had the most visual effort put into them. \\n\\n\r\nThe first half was pure joy. However, what detracts from the show was a second half that really struggled in creating an actual narrative to follow. The narrative it did create was at best, serviceable, at worst, everything I don't like about action anime. From an absurd, over-the-top, nonsensical climax that is rife with plot-holes and contrivance, to a lack of secondary characters and actual, emotional connections. The second half wasn't bad, per say, it was just such a drastic turn from the wonderful and endlessly love-able first half. Little Witch Academia is a family show with exceptional characters, and I felt like it's attempt at a more focused narrative didn't deliver as much as I would have wanted. \\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia, towards its final stretch,  buckles under the weight of expectation. When creating an anime you are expected to have these bombastic resolutions, where the soundtrack flairs and the characters yell loudly and tears are shed and while I do, honestly, adore these characters and felt completely empathetic towards them, all of these potential emotions were drained out by how grandiose and absurd the finale ended up being. From happy slice of life to world-ending threat in the span of a few episodes. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Character and Narrative]\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to my thoughts on The Enchanted Parade and the first OVA, the characters in Little Witch Academia carry this show. But that's exactly what characters do. A great story doesn't make good characters, good characters make a great story. In fact, characters are perhaps the single most important element of a film or series. Without them, even the most captivating world would be dry and witless. What carried me through this series' less interesting moments was always just how attached I was to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSpecifically Akko, who at first reminded me of Yuuko from Nichijou, with her blind, ditsy optimism and relentless energy. I loved her arc, hell, I loved her. She's the best. I eagerly followed some of the forums from episode to episode as I watched this series, trying to see what people were saying as it aired, and to my surprise I saw such a negative outlook on Akko and her entire arc as a character.\\n\\n\r\nFrom what I saw, people not only expected, but wanted a character that was more overpowered, more capable, smarter, and all these elements that define the majority of anime protagonists. From what I saw, for some crazy reason, people were criticizing Akko for actually have admitted flaws. I think once I saw that, I quickly understood just how different my opinions and expectations for the television I watch are, especially when compared to the more broad anime audience. I was baffled by just how many people didn't even bother to appreciate what Trigger was going with her with character. Which honestly made me realize exactly why the second half, which I didn't like remotely as much as the first, was better received by that audience. They wanted the loud, abrasive, bombastic action where the protagonist pulls out massive, overpowered moves that solve world-ending conflicts. Meanwhile, I just want a cute, wholesome series about friends overcoming conflict that feels grounded in a charming, magical world. Because that's what this series was!\\n\\n\r\nTo continue to address Akko's characterization, this young Japanese girl, who has absolutely no history of magic in any of her family, is the first student in Luna Nova without said magical background. Luna Nova being the Hogwarts of this universe. Unlike a character like Harry Potter, who was always destined for greatness and came with powerful talents, Akko was relatively hopeless, even after she found Shiny Rod, a celestial staff that was once wielded by her hero, the entertainer, Shiny Chariot. Even with this potentially powerful weapon, she still endlessly struggled through her schoolwork, and that was the prominent focus of the first half of this series.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the initial episodes were episodic in that they contained a narrative that was resolved within that episode, the over-arching story was about school and learning. Which I think the majority of people can relate to. Akko entered this school trying to be like her hero, however, she didn't posses any of the knowledge to actually succeed. In fact, she was abrasive and downright stupid in a lot of her beliefs. Akko thought that she could succeed simply through believing, and that made her almost drop out. This arc, following her rude awakening and the ultimate catharsis felt when she finally put wand-to-magic and began to truly work hard was infinitely more appealing than any other story-focused element delivered in this series. Not only because it was a story that felt grounded, yet delightful because of the world it is set in. But because, through this episodic half, we got an insight into Akko's attitudes and the obvious flaws within them. \\n\\n\r\nLike it or not, this is neat characterization. You can't succeed through just believing. You have to work hard. When Akko ultimately does, we, as viewers, finally get to see her using the magic she learns to succeed in more difficult tasks and we grow with her. This connection that was formed between viewer (me) and the protagonist was wondrous because of this. This is without even mentioning just how great some of these side-stories are, especially since a lot of them focused on the wonderful secondaries. The surreal Sucy-episode, where we got to see the inner-mechanisms of the most mysterious student's mind, all storyboarded by the venerable Hiroyuki Imaishi from Gurrenn Lagann and Kill la Kill fame. Other stories include some fun cartoon tropes, such as the love potion, and others are simply there due to the world created, such as broom-races, which end up being some of my favorite outings of the series. Not only because it clear just how much effort was put into animating these episodes, but because they all exuded so much character and fun, providing that nostalgic feeling I talked about. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of Little Witch Academia's plot elements are hinted at through background details and surprisingly subtle character moments. Which is great. I think these moments work so well because of how invested we are in these characters. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of subtext and meta-commentary in this series too. The more obvious ones being gags in reference to other Trigger shows, like one episode paying total homage to Gurrenn Lagann, to other moments referencing various western cartoons, which is natural since Trigger seems to have an infatuation with them. There is meta-commentary on the state of critics and reception and negativity within the entertainment industry, too, which wasn't too subtle, but was fun to have none-the-less. A permeating theme of characters, which were entertainers, being driven to brash decisions based on the reception of their audience. The parallel here being to the entertainment industry within the real world. This felt so preposterously ironic because It felt as though this series was victim to that too. I felt much more passion in these more episodic stories that built towards the end-goal in the first half, and the few we had in the second half, than just about anything within the main narrative of the series. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Visuals and Sound]\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to most Trigger shows, the character design here is amazing. I won't go on about this, since I'm pretty sure I wrote a whole thesis on it in my Enchanted Parade review. The design is, ultimately, perfect. The way each character is characterized through distinct eyes is wonderful. The lines are pretty thin and the designs are simplistic in the sense that the characters themselves don't harbor an immense amount of detail, which makes character animation easier and it actually breathes more life into these characters. Giving them all unique attributes through animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, while not remotely as impressive and consistent as the OVAs, was pretty good overall. Certain episodes looked utterly breathtaking, such as the the Sucy episode that I'm sure is a fan favorite of many, the broom-race episode, and even the Wild Hunt one. As I already said, these more episodic moments were filled with passion for the product, and it left me feeling as though this was what the creator wanted to do the most. Which I wish he had, and didn't pander to the fans that needed some kind of silly, shoehorned narrative to strangle this series towards its conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was solid as well. There were certain stings that were more memorable than others. The first OP and second ED were solid as well. The more classical swells in the emotional scenes were surprisingly poignant, though, although I think the reason a lot of the emotional scenes were so affecting was due to the characters and not the music. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I do want to point out is that the voice acting here is generally pretty top-notch. I'm not one to constantly notice Japanese voice acting as easily as I can notice exceptional performance in English television and film, however, here it is very clear. Especially Akko's voice actress, Megumi Han, is spectacular in her role and provides so many amazing inflections and cadences. She's a true standout. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe first half to Little Witch Academia is unrestrained near-perfection. It was a testament to the wonders that an episodic show can do. Just because something is episodic, narratively, doesn't mean it can't have character growth, and seeing Akko go from optimistic believer to optimistic doer may have been the single most inspiring thing I've seen on television in years. I was genuinely inspired by this this ditsy girl, and I think that alone warrants huge praise, since my hard, cold exterior is hard to break through. \\n\\n\r\nThe second half wasn't without merit, as some of the episodic stories were great there, and even some of the more cliche story beats within the main narrative were emotionally powerful simply due to the connection already established with our protagonist and her professor, Ursula. I think their bond, as well as Diana's arc, carried a lot of this series' weaker elements. Speaking on those, the finale was too over-the-top for me. I think it wasn't properly built up and the entire thing felt much too stupid. A bombastic, trigger-esq finale for a series like Kill la Kill was natural since the series was absurd and over-the-top from the get-go, but here it just felt shoehorned. The final scene in the finale was great, but that's because it was restrained and pulled back to the character beats we fell in love with at the start of the series, pulling Akko's wonderful arc closed in a somewhat messy, yet cathartic way. \\n\\n\r\nI hardly even had to touch on my other negative of this series, the romance elements, but this problem, while semi-persistent, was never too distracting. I honestly feel like romance didn't belong in this series. While thankfully it wasn't as distracting as a lot of anime is, with endless, exploitative lesbian-bait and senseless fanservice, which this show thankfully had none of, the tame romance was unnecessary as well. Although I think my view on this is slightly skewed because of how obsessed with romance the fans are, from \"shipping\" characters to constantly reading into every scene as if it has something to do with the creators trying to hint at these characters falling in love. It was just needless. That being said, it didn't actually play a huge role and I never felt as though it fully ruined anything for me. \\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia was an excessively fun experience. While the second half dips in quality due to the series losing sight of what made me love it so much in the first place, the episodic first half built such a strong connection to the characters that I was still wholly invested in the majority of this show's cliched story. It wasn't as good as The Enchanted Parade OVA, which promptly blew me away, but it had it's own positives as well. More characterization of the side characters, specifically Diana who was more of a main character by the end, and a deeper look at what makes this intriguing world tick. I loved that. Trigger's focus on minutia shows, and the elements that were left subtle were incredibly rewarding to notice.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire series was reliant on its characters though. I'll repeat once more, every character in this show is great. Even the love interest, Andrew, has his own set of interesting character-related emotional battles to fight that I actually felt connected to. Each character, or, in this case, person, brings something unique and interesting to the table. While the climax left me a little high and dry, the conclusion to these character arcs still left me feeling warm inside. Watch this series, not for the world, not for the animation, and definitely not for the story. Watch for the characters. They will live in your mind forever, and you wouldn't want it any other way.",

I really don't feel like it added anything worth adding from the OVA. When its not stretching that OVA's content to the breaking point over 20 episodes with very little changes to the script, its introducing half-baked ideas that either don't go anywhere or are flat out McGuffins so that a story can happen. A lot like Kill la Kill, the best episode was the Sucy one that had nothing to do with the actual plot and was just goofy sideadventures. It seems Trigger will never rise above its own problems of bad dramatic turns late in the game or always having the giant bombastic ending that feels more and more empty each time they do it. \\n\\n\r\nWhy does Trigger do this to me? Please stick to shorts.\\n",

            "content": "Well well, looks like this is the most undeservedly hyped anime I've watched so far in my endlessly long journey in the worlds of Far East Asian animation. Wait, don't grab your pitchforks, lemme explain myself. And no, no spoilers. I... guess? Not like you'd have to worry about this with Lil Witch Academia anyway.\r\nLittle Witch Academia tells the story of a girl who daydreams about magic, becoming a witch, and all this stuff. Mostly because magic DOES exist in her world. This is particularly interesting for a setting because becoming a witch is an attainable goal for the main character, she's not batshit delusionalalways talking about magic on a normal world, unaware that magic actually exists...\\n\\n\r\nFrom that point onwards, well... generic_anime_storyline.txt . Everything you've watched a dozen times before WILL happen here, except on a magical, witch environment. There is the calm, ponderate and intelligent friend; there's the unreliable and mysterious pal; there's this badass character that is the main character's hero; there's this cocky (who so happens to be blond and rich); there's this rebellious, smug and edgy girl who doesn't abide the rules; there's this goofy and kindhearted teacher that probably holds a secret (dunno, didn't watch enough to tell); there's the main character in her first interaction with the magical world demonstrating to have insane abilities or otherwise being the chosen one to harness aforementioned insane abilities... see? Everything you've watched before. So yeah, the characters and the storyline are bland and boring. But...\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty awesome. It's detailed, it's \"minimalistic\", fluid, artsy, dynamic, cartoonish, colorful, vivid. The character designs are really interesting (when they're not the boring old stereotypical face we've always seen); heck even the blond cocky girl which could otherwise have a generic blonde cocky girl face looks unique and interesting. The sound is... fitting, I guess? It's not bad, so I guess it's good.\\n\\n\r\nYeah. Honestly, this is the kind of stuff I wouldn't watch for the plot. I mean, if you're out for some good ol friendly fun time with cutely designed characters, go for it, I'd said it's worth it. If you want something intelligent, or just not the same old same old... I'd say the gorgeous design won't be sufficient to keep you from slowly walking away, wondering what happened to all these people to praise this so much. I mean, it happened to me.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI can\u2019t recall if I\u2019ve talked about the Harry Potter series in-depth in the past, but, even if I did, it\u2019s too relevant to Little Witch Academia and my own interests to leave on the wayside.\r\nLong story short, I love that universe. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are an awesome trio of protagonists. The lore is interesting and packed with lots of details. Its premise, setting, and timeline make for a neat setup over the course of its whole run. I\u2019ve read all the books, and I\u2019ve seen the adapted films more times than I cancount. It\u2019s simply a world that I hold dear.\\n\\n\r\nDo I put Little Witch Academia on the same pedestal personally? No, it doesn\u2019t quite earn a special place in my heart. But what it does do regardless is craft and present an anime that\u2019s worthy of praise all the same.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nWithin Little Witch Academia, the audience certainly finds magic and its usage within. However, the anime brings with it much more than just a spell or two.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, the initial direction of the show causes worry as it treads dangerously close to repetition and a lack of creativity given the films that preceded this television project. That worry disappears, though, once the show embraces its episodic format. For, rather than always relying on the power of the Shiny Rod to ultimately save the day, many of the episodes within this first half of the season build well off the setting. A high-speed broomstick race. A reanimated undead skeleton man who cannot slow down. A bee whose sting infatuates the stung.\\n\\n\r\nThese individualized, slice-of-life episodes invoke the best of the anime\u2019s comedic chops thanks to their oft crazy happenings. The wholesome atmosphere throughout also gives the show a fun feel as Akko and the gang go about trying their hardest and having a blast while doing so. Perhaps most importantly, these scenes start to add to the lore of Little Witch Academia, investing in the in-universe details that bolster the fantastical nature of their wizarding world.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode eleven, with the blue moon and the scary abyss, marks the show\u2019s big shift from a comedic, slice-of-life offering to a dramatic, plot-oriented tale. Not to say that the laughs and the somewhat one-off episodes completely disappear, for they do not as evidenced by the trip to Lotte\u2019s hometown. But, even then, the content starts to serve a larger purpose beyond only having a cheerful time with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis shift occurs most readily in the emotional drive of Little Witch Academia. Intimate exchanges, such as Diana\u2019s ordeal and Akko\u2019s apology to Chariot, strike at the show\u2019s dramatic side that it kept nestled beneath its comedy. Seeing the content basically mature in this manner during its run not only generates dynamism in its delivery but also argues for a stronger writing foundation as the laughing and the crying require a tighter balance.\\n\\n\r\nParts of the second half here do not go without a couple of hiccups. For instance, Croix\u2019s whole evil subplot doesn\u2019t coalesce very well as it strings together as a bunch of one-off, behind-the-scenes scenes.\\n\\n\r\nWorse still, Professor Ursula does not say anything to anyone about Croix despite knowing of her behavior, and she gets constantly interrupted as she attempts to explain the important details that surround the plot. These two specific factors lead to an unnatural progression in the writing as it becomes less about Akko\u2019s journey and more about the fact that the anime refuses to let Professor Ursula talk.\\n\\n\r\nTo combat this corralling of the narrative, Little Witch Academia incorporates other elements that free up the structure. The major twist about Akko\u2019s nonexistent magical abilities provides some much-needed context and truly challenges her beliefs based on the (now known) source. Plus, the Grand Triskellion being nothing more than a literal twig, a red herring of sorts, reinforces the show\u2019s talking points that much more.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, the anime soars highest with those points as its bigger picture reveals itself on a thematic level. Distinct motifs on words, friendships, and emotions layer the anime many times over, leading to a heartfelt theme on the \u201cmagic\u201d that exists within everyone. A positive outlook from a positive show that is positively welcome.\\n\\n\r\nOnce Little Witch Academia concludes, the audience can appreciate this message and apply it to their own lives. And, having experienced the well-timed comedy and the solid drama that made up the entire project, they can also walk away knowing that they just finished a nice story, too.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best joys of watching Little Witch Academia comes from the visuals on display.\\n\\n\r\nThey blend together both pretty background artistry and expressive movement. The art loves its shots that showcase a wide view of the Luna Nova school as the sun, moon, or magic stone shine overhead. And the animation takes advantage of squashing and stretching to give Akko and the other characters springy, fuller actions. Combined, they make the anime a ton of fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly, the visuals\u2019 generally refrain from vibrant colors and bright lenses, keeping the look and feel of Little Witch Academia in a middle zone between mundane and loud. This setup allows for the designs to do much of the talking. And talk they do. Akko\u2019s ponytail, Lotte\u2019s large, rounded glasses, Sucy\u2019s phantom feet, Diana\u2019s striped-green hair, Professor Ursula\u2019s hip game. None of these details even get into their different changes, depending on their current outing or eventual outcome.\\n\\n\r\nNot to mention Amanda\u2019s tomboyish looks, Constanze\u2019s utility belt, Jasminka\u2019s pigtails, and the other professors\u2019 shapes, standings, and even species. And everyone\u2019s witch outfits \u2013 complete with hat, coat, and belt \u2013 finish off this whole ensemble.\\n\\n\r\nAndrew\u2019s prim-and-proper demeanor and Croix\u2019s \u201cfuturistic\u201d outfit continue the trend of variance as does the myriad of side characters met. Even the background people, while often sporting goofy faces, deserve appreciation if only because they aren\u2019t just an afterthought but receive at least some attention when events go down.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also likes its silly faces, creating for Akko many a reaction for her to use no matter the situation. Moreover, certain sequences flaunt the magic premise as much as possible. From Vajarois\u2019s purification to the Shiny Rod\u2019s extravagant transformations, Little Witch Academia makes it possible to pick out specific moments that dazzle in their magical splendor.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair in a critical sense, not everything goes perfectly for the visuals. They replay the same \u201cNoctu Orfei Aude Fraetor\u201d clip from the first episode one too many times throughout the season. Later on, some of the cuts seem to involve lots of closeups rather than capturing a whole scene or at least varying the cinematography. And, despite the intriguing world around them, they don\u2019t really vary up the locations, going so far as to visit the Arcturus Forest on at least three separate occasions.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the good points far outweigh the bad ones, leaving the audience with a pleasant visual experience for pretty much the entire season.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia is Akko\u2019s journey.\\n\\n\r\nShe comes to Luna Nova without almost any shred of magical prowess. She essentially starts from nothing, and it\u2019s that bottom baseline that makes her a character worth rooting for. The audience wants her to fly. The audience wants her to succeed. The audiences wants her to follow in the footsteps of her idol Shiny Chariot.\\n\\n\r\nOver the course of the season, Akko doesn\u2019t always fly, succeed, and follow, though. But that\u2019s okay. Part of her character arc involves encountering these problems and, through failure, becoming the better for it. Chariot\u2019s signature catchphrase spells it out: \u201cIt\u2019s your belief in yourself that makes up your magic.\u201d Her words are constantly repeated throughout the season, becoming a pillar for Akko\u2019s character that the events challenge again and again. So that when she does finally triumph \u2013 be it in summoning hope or transforming into an animal for the first time ever \u2013 those moments flourish that much more.\\n\\n\r\nAkko doesn\u2019t only experience failure; she also learns a lot about life along the way. Through her quest of unlocking the full potential of the Shiny Rod, she improves herself immensely thanks to those Seven Words. She gains patience. She respects tradition. She understands thankfulness. While she mainly seeks to become the greatest witch in the world (second only to her beloved Chariot), she simultaneously, slowly evolves into a better person overall.\\n\\n\r\nTwo constant traits stick with Akko throughout Little Witch Academia regardless of what she does or is doing: determination and optimism. These traits certainly help her on her own journey, but they also influence the people around her. Lotte, Sucy, and the others do not technically receive a whole lot of attention since (to reiterate) this tale is Akko\u2019s and not theirs. However, Akko\u2019s passion gives them the means to overcome their own problems, for she values them and their friendships much more than she cares about her own success.\\n\\n\r\nNowhere does her influence strike hardest than with Andrew, Professor Ursula, and Diana. Andrew, the son of a prominent politician, viewed witches and their magic as useless, repeating similar thoughts that others of his world have voiced as of late. By chance, however, he continually crosses paths with Akko \u2013 and so he follows an arc of sorts. The more she demonstrates courage in the face of adversity, the more his perspective changes in a positive manner.\\n\\n\r\nBack in the magic world, Professor Ursula mentors Akko in her studies. She sticks up for Akko, too, like when she berates that one formal teacher for putting her down despite the small yet noticeable progress she has made. And she also guides Akko in her worded quest. Croix\u2019s meddling spurs her into action, and their complex relationship forces her to hate herself for her own pitfalls. Regardless, Akko instills in Professor Ursula the hopes and the dreams that she had always instilled in others years prior. And, if for nothing else, she wishes to protect that \u201cbrilliance\u201d (as she similarly quotes it) in turn.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Diana, Diana always butted heads with Akko (and vice versa), so they never really saw eye-to-eye. Diana, though, knew that, despite her own capabilities, Akko had a heart unlike anybody else. She experiences it personally when Akko goes completely out of her way to at first change Diana\u2019s mind and then support her decisions, ultimately forming the close bond they now share.\\n\\n\r\nOnce Akko\u2019s journey nears its end, all these relationships reach their storied conclusions. Andrew sees magic not as a hinderance but as something worth believing in, aiding Akko in their final battle. Akko completes Chariot\u2019s quest, telling her idol that realizes now that she must be her own great witch. And both Diana and her other friends seek out and console her when her beliefs contradict the very traits she champions, reciprocating her kindness with some of their own.\\n\\n\r\nThus, Little Witch Academia makes it clear: Akko upholds the story\u2019s theme on the \u201cmagic\u201d within about as perfectly as possible. She grows as a character, affects those around her for the better, and inspires the audience to do the same. The fact that she levitates on a broom ever-so-slightly by herself \u2013 and with everyone around to see it happen at that \u2013 during the last scene of the season likewise makes for a fitting finish to her thoughtful journey.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the voice-acting performances in Little Witch Academia are strong in execution, yet let it be known to everyone: Megumi Han as Akko figuratively steals the show.\\n\\n\r\nShe becomes the underdog witch right from the very first scene of the season. The different inflections in her voice. The wide range of emotions demonstrated. The laughs, the cries, the yells, the jubilation. It doesn\u2019t do her performance justice to simply call it \u201cfantastic.\u201d Arguably speaking, Ms. Han deserves the highest of praise: that no VA except her could capture the character so perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the rest of the music and the sound cannot match up to Ms. Han\u2019s voice acting, it tries its absolute best to do so anyway. Specifically, the original soundtrack makes a name for itself, too. It has its slice-of-life tunes and groovier pieces during downtime or charged segments.\\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s the other end that truly grabs the ear. Rousing trumpets, delicate violins, gentle wind instruments, soft piano keys, chimes, harp strings. These sounds blend together as sweeping orchestral arrangements that fit the triumphant direction of the story and coincide with the magical premise at large.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia\u2019s opening tracks fall next in line. The first OP \u201cShiny Ray\u201d wins the top prize out of the two available. Its sparkly beginning leads into acoustic guitar and a steady drum beat which in turn invite violins and harmonizing to round out the track. With the strong vocals throughout, and the faint sound of a piano in the background, this OP captures the magic of the content that follows it.\\n\\n\r\nBy comparison, the second OP \u201cMind Conductor\u201d has some cool electric guitar going for it early on. But much of the first half sounds too cluttered in its structure as the vocals, drums, and that guitar seem too out of sync. It isn\u2019t until a bit over the halfway point that the song finally picks up steam with a more streamlined beat, background vocals, and a pronounced orchestral composition. So, while the second OP here starts off somewhat muddied, it finishes off clear and strong.\\n\\n\r\nLast but not (too) least, the ending tracks bring up the rear. Once again, the first offering \u201cHoshi wo Todoreba\u201d comes out ahead. The distinct bass and the outer-space noises give it a bump during the start of its playing, but, opposite to the second OP, the further along it goes, the less interesting it becomes.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cToumei na Tsubasa,\u201d the second ED, somewhat mirrors its sister song, but it ups the otherworldly sounds and the energy involved. It plateaus for the whole length of the track, though. It doesn\u2019t go anywhere intriguing, and it doesn\u2019t become a bore to listen to. It simply coasts along as a fine song and nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound-effects within Little Witch Academia do have their positives (all the wand-waving magic) and their negatives (braking broomsticks). And, again, the EDs aren\u2019t exactly on the same level as the anime itself. However, the first OP, the grand OST, and especially Ms. Han\u2019s VA performance as Akko keep the music and the sound from ever crashing and burning.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI owe a lot of the happiness I got out of this show to Akko.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m a fan of kind, happy characters, so, from the get-go, she was already someone who I liked to follow. She was also really funny. So much so that I still quote some of her mannerisms to myself to this day (e.g., \u201cWaku wakuuu!\u201d, using the phonetic spelling). Her silly reactions and fierce determination to accomplish the obstacles set in her path kept the funnies going, too. And her positive attitude in general was an infectious part of her personality that I value highly.\\n\\n\r\nAs the episodes went along, she became kinder, funnier, and optimistic-er, placing her easily at the top of my list of favorite characters from this anime. Other favorites of mine include Diana and her interesting relationship with Akko. Professor Ursula and her guiding nature. Lotte and her plainness. Andrew and his outsider\u2019s perspective. Amanda and her rebellious phases. Constanze and the fact that she doesn\u2019t talk. Just an awesome bunch of cast members.\\n\\n\r\nI was ambivalent towards only two characters: Croix and Sucy. I thought Croix was okay. It wasn\u2019t until her obvious care for Chariot caused conflict in her person despite her evil intentions that I started to view her in a different light.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Sucy, she was kind of jerk to Akko, and I wish she wasn\u2019t. I get that her role as a Debbie Downer of sorts contrasts well with Akko\u2019s cheerfulness. Her drug-like motif also got a chuckle out of me now and again, and she would offset her meanness with a rare kind gesture. And it\u2019s all rather ironic in a way because my favorite episode of the series goes to episode nine, \u201cAkko\u2019s Adventure in Sucyworld.\u201d It was downright hilarious, and it featured Sucy not being Sucy so much which was a big plus.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the characters, I found myself getting emotional at times. Not tears or anything extreme, but I could tell that, if I let my guard down, they would escape me. I also liked the different action sequences, the individualized episodes, and the magic premise in general. And I had an immensely fun time writing about the major theme of this anime since it had ideals and thoughts that were both uplifting and worthwhile to me.\\n\\n\r\nHaving now completed this one and written out this review in full, I close the book on my Spring 2017 anime run. And I\u2019m very glad that it was this show that got to have those honors.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia, with a swish and a flick, conjures up a wonderful anime. Its strong thematic roots, neat visual style, purposeful cast members, orchestral music, and entertaining moments make this spell one to behold. And the lack of a lightning-bolt scar does not change this fact.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, Akko\u2019s positive journey brings fun comedy and solid drama, and a theme on the \u201cmagic\u201d within people soars high and far, but the second half\u2019s writing chops lose their flow on occasion\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Good, lovely character designs, expressive animation, and numerous magical spectacles outweigh some of the repetitive clips, the lagging cinematography, and the low variance in background artistry\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, Akko grows, affects, and inspires, embodying the narrative\u2019s main theme through and through\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Good, Megumi Han delivers what will most likely go down as her defining VA performance, the orchestral OST triumphs ahead, the first OP captures the spirit of this adventure, but the remaining OP and the EDs cannot follow suit\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, Akko was awesome, the other characters were nice too, the action was cool, the touching times were there, it was a lot of fun to write about, and it made for a happy closer to the overall season\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "A DOKI DOKI NO WAKU WAKU review. (Minor spoilers follow)\r\nStudio Trigger is like Akko Kagari in a way. They ain't the best but damn if they didn't try their best in doing what they love. And seeing their hard work always brings a smile to your face, even if their work isn't the greatest ever. \r\nLittle Witch Academia 2017 stars Akko and her friends, Lotte and Suc- wait scratch that, Lotte and Sucy hardly appear in any meaningful capacity. Let's try that again.\r\nLittle Witch Akko stars the titular Akko and Diana having adventures together on their journey to save magic. Along the way, Akko meetsa cast of colorful characters who are immediately forgotten after a few episodes with the exception of Chariot and Croix. \\n\\n\r\nBefore continuing, I would like to utilize the \"Triangle of Truth\" concept which classifies films on a triangle diagram with 3 attributes: Story, Characters and Emotion, used initially by RedLetterMedia to describe Rogue One in their Rogue One review. A film typically can only have, at max, 2 of the attributes. In our case study, we can conclude Little Witch Academia 2017 excels in Characters and Emotion, but suffers greatly from a bad plot.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with Characters and Emotion. LWA's biggest strength is in getting the audience to truly enjoy the characters and their personalities. Every character, even throwaway ones like Annabel or Lotte, are immensely enjoyable onscreen. Akko's character is good enough to standout on her own, it's charming to see her struggle against impossible odds and her optimistic demeanor on life is refreshing and invokes an emotional connection with the viewer, making her very relatable and likable. Seeing Akko smile and go \"Doki Doki no Waku Waku\" is enough to bring a smile to even the most cynical viewer. Chariot and Croix's characters and their relationship with each other is also worth mentioning. Their friendship/romance is cute to see unfold and painful to see fall apart. The drama surrounding them is very much human and down-to-earth, and even the villainous Croix has very human traits that redeems her character and make her seem all the more tragic and sympathetic. In addition to that, the animations portraying them are so vividly crafted that you can tell from a glance how the characters. And thanks to lovable characters, whenever they're in a predicament, we suffer along with them; whenever they're joyful, we celebrate alongside them. We grew along Akko across this 25 episode journey. And therein lies the emotional resonance within the viewer. In the final episode, when Akko went \"Doki Doki no Waku Waku\" in the preview video as she always does in most of the preview videos, I had goosebumps all over. A testament to how lovable the characters in the series are.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is to say that it's a grand disappointment and a damned shame that the plot of LWA is weak as hell. Even with strong characters, the plot is barebones and unfocused. Now a simple plot isn't bad, even great films like Star Wars (1977) have simple plots, where the plot is just a loose framework to depict a grand adventure in space. However, in the case of Little Witch Academia, the framework in which the plot provides is insufficient and poorly utilized, resulting in a lot of wasted potential. The unfocused element comes in as the show itself doesn't know what kind of anime it wants to be, a slice of life with an overarching storyline, or a plot-focused story where each episode advances the plot to its goal. Little Witch Academia at its very core is a Hero's Journey type story, with Akko receiving the call to adventure, undergoing several conflicts (of which include refusal of the call) and finally triumphing against the odds and returning home a hero.  That's all well and good, but the ultimate goal and the antagonist isn't established until halfway through the series. The first half of the series is a very slow Slice of Life type tale with a hardly anything tying the episodes together until the overarching plot is finally established midway through the series.This essentially leads to very erratic pacing issues in the overall narrative. Hell, the standard \"Hero conflict moment\" only happens near the very end of the series, making Akko's recovery breeze by very quickly and providing  very little buildup for the final climax. \\n\\n\r\nThe flashback scenes with Chariot and Croix are very enjoyable but they break the pacing very badly by inserting them into random episodes. It could have been easily fixed by giving the duo one or two dedicated episodes to flesh out the characters and their history with each other. The flashbacks don't even occur naturally within the context of the anime, which makes them very jarring when they appear. And as I mentioned earlier, Akko's roommates are given very little attention despite their importance in the original OVA series. Diana's conflict where she's saved by Akko is bookended with Akko being saved by Diana a few episodes later happened in such a short interval that the bookend effect doesn't provide much of a response from the viewer. Which is a shame, Trigger has plenty of good tools to make a great plot but they just don't know how to utilize them properly. In the end, even with 25 episodes, not much happened plotwise and I could summarize the whole plot in 3 short sentences. Even if they had more episodes to work with, I'm doubtful they could add much to the series without breaking the pacing even further. It's a cardinal sin most of the characters and world building go underutilized. For instance, Lotte's ability to talk to fairies is only briefly alluded to in the series despite it being a massive plot point in OVA2 and an awesome climatic moment in the Terio manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also has a big problem with exposition and character dialogue. Exposition is done very unnaturally and at times, it feels as if the characters are directly telling the audience what is happening. I had hoped that the overreliance on exposition in the first episode was just there to guide new audiences into the world of LWA, but almost every episode features this, even for scenes where it's clearly shown what is happening or for events that can be inferred naturally from the context where it takes place. For instance, there's a scene in episode 1 where a monstrous chicken is shown to have petrification abilities as it turns parts of a forest into stone. Even the most passive viewer would know by then the monster chicken can petrify objects, but Sucy butts in and essentially tells the audience that the chicken can petrify objects after the scene occurs. It's unnecessary and a waste of time for Sucy to explain this. In addtion, character motivations are always spelled out for the viewer and the viewer feels like they are very passively being spoonfed information they already know. This eats up time which ought to be better spent on more scenes establishing or expanding the overall plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe series conclusion is masterfully done. I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel anything as it happened. It more than makes up the lackluster ending of Kill la Kill. While not quite TTGL levels, LWA's ending is so well done you will end up staring at the screen as I did and reminiscing of all the fun times and adventures you had with the show, wishing there was just one more episode to go. \\n\\n\r\nStill, in spite of all its flaws, I can't in any good faith rate this lower than an 8. The passion Trigger showcased is endearing and more than makes up for it. The love for their project makes you root for them every single step of the way. Which is why I wholeheartedly recommend this anime to everyone. In the end, it's the journey that counts, and what a damned great journey it was, being hyped for every single episode and having fun all the way though. The series is , as Akko would say , a Doki Doki no Waku Waku adventure.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "By the time I am writing this review I have seen everything that has to do with Litlle Witch Academia. Little witch Academia is an anime about witches and the power of belief.\r\nStory: The story in this anime is simple and easy to understand (Akko wants to be a witch that inspires awe and dreams) and that is all fine and good. I can however not say I was impressed by it, as nothing really evolved. Sure, there were some fighting against \"magical beasts\", but there never was any real tension or purpose in it all, as everything would always be resolved in a sothorough and easy way that it reminded me of these kid shows tailored for 2 year old children. In the end the story made no sense and was quite pointless.\\n\r\nArt & Sound: The art was a bit messy, but fit the show, as it was supposed to be a bit wild and simplistic, but easy on the eyes for younger audiences. The sound was ok, but there was nothing that impressed me in any way, with the exception of how stupid and childish all the spells and their pronunciation sounded.\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters mostly all had very simple characteristics and backgrounds that, except for Diana's story, and ever so slightly Akko's. There really was basically no character development during the anime or any of the movies except for Diana becoming more open and admitting herself to be a fan of Shiny Chariot.\\n\r\nOverall: This anime had it's ups and downs. Sometimes I kinda liked it, but for most part it was somewhat disappointing. As the story is one of the most important things to me in, basically, anything, I couldn't really enjoy this show to much, and I don't really see why it's so popular. If I had to recommend it to someone it would as some thing when you're really bored and need something flashy, but that don't require any brain power to watch.",

So far, this anime is really good. (it's updated now)\r\nCharacters may seem superficial at the beginning but they start changing. Akko, the MC, is really really annoying and stupid until episode 7, I guess (it's the one she has exams to do). After that, she starts changing a lot. She's still a bit annoying but you can see how much she's improving. The same happens with the other characters, the show starts showing more about them. I think all charactershere are interesting, but Akko's friends are surely the ones I enjoy the most.\\n\\n\r\nThe ideas from the OVAs were well adapted and deepened. Diana had the most relevant change in the series, she's not as stuck-up as in the OVAs. Even though she still has that \"superior\" pose, she helps everyone who asks for her help her and she doesn't bully Akko (her \"friends\", though, are still the same bullies).\\n\\n\r\nAbout the story, well, in the first \"season\" (the 12 first episodes), it's more like a slice of life. Later, they started developing the \"main story\". It's still an episodic serie but you can clearly see now the \"greater\" story behind every episode and there's more action.\\n\\n\r\nArt and soundtrack are great, but, well, it's TRIGGER STUDIOS, so, no less would be expected.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a very chilling and funny anime. There's also lots of references to other animes and general pop culture (my favorite one so far is the show's parody of Twilight). If you want to have a nice time and some laughs, this is your show.\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE:\\n\\n\r\nNow that I watched everything, I can update this review. I've got nothing much to add but I'll put my last impressions here: it definitely gets more action at the end, characters are really really well-developed (particularly Akko and Diana) and the story is good and well-played. It's a really good show. The last episode, though, was a bit less intense than I expected.",

Atsuko aims to be like chariot, and works hard towards the goal despite facing many obstacles. The story is about how as she gives it her all to move towards that goal. \r\nIt is definitely a deviation from the normal anime series and takes after the western cartoon episodes such as kim possible initially. However, as the episodes moves along, the randomness slowly decreases, and the anime moves into the main storyline. Silly actions of Atsuko is a given, and despite having a separate story for each episode, the mainstoryline moves the series along. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is great, the side characters are well drawn, even if they may only appear for only one episode. The character each have their own goals and are emphasized well, except for certain characters like Diana's partners.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it is just a simple comedy and remind me of how people tries their hardest to reach their goals and it really is just satisfying to watch. If slice of life is your thing, you might enjoy this series as something different.",

            "content": "Little Witch Academia is a okay show. I mean I watched the whole thing and didn't got bored by it. It had a fun upbeat tone and cool visuals. Although, it upset or disappointed me also at other times.\r\nBut with that said, if you're intrested in this anime in some kind of way, it can really be your thing. What annoyed were more things in the detail rather than really big, offensive issues. And I can easily see people witch just aren't bothered by these details. To foreshadow a bit: If you like our main-character Akko, you will probably like the show.\r\nI already said thatthere are people which can enjoy the show, so I can just continue to give the praise before I come to the part I didn't like. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I REALLY loved about Little Witch Academia was the character design. Every character has a very simple but often lovable personality. And the character design just selled this personality SO well! My favorite example of this is Amanda. She's the rebel. She rides her broom only on highspeed and does accrobatic tricks with it, it almost looks like pole dancing (don't get me wrong, this is fucking awesome). Due her rebellious nature she has very spikey and upward pointed hair. And her hair is the only one which mixes two very diffrent colours, pink and blonde. This mix itself is rebellious. She is also one of the tallest and athletic looking girls in the show. All of this just screams \"Wanna pick a fight? Come at me!\". It's so great to see her with a confident smile on screen. And as said, many other designs support their characters in such great ways. Diana, Constanze, Shiny Chariot and many more!\\n\\n\r\nAlso the overall design of the show is great. Gates, magical tools, symbols... all those make it the world believable. All in all, the show is really pleasent to look at and builds this childish magic witch-world. Witch just puts me in a good mood.\\n\\n\r\nWell, let's get to the part I don't like, and witch made me give this show a 5, despite of all the rest. It's our main-character Akko. She's our over motivated girl. And I hate how she gets away with so much things! She isn't the best student there and causes also a lot of trouble there, but she doesn't seem to face an consequences for this. And her attitude was just annoying for me. She should be someone who other could look up to her despite her lack of magical skill. Well, this doens't work. Because if you look up to someone, you're inspired of the skill this person has and that you can become to some extent like this. Instead, characters don't change because Akko inspires them. They change because Akko forces them to. This made a lot of cool character weak to me. I found them cool  because they stood on their own feet. But after their great Akko-change they were somehow dependent on her. \\n\\n\r\nFor example: Diana. The great rival of Akko. She was the rich-and-smart-girl archetype. And a really cool one at that. Like others of this archetype she isn't bitchy. Instead she's really competent and the voice of reason. But after Akko chases her to her home and tells her that everything is possible Akko should clearly be the more competent person in the narrative. But this just isn't true. Every time Diana acted against the will of Akko she was right. Hell, she even resolves one of Akko's problems. It was sad to see Diana to loose strength in the series.\\n\\n\r\nAtleast I wished Akko would get some developpment in the direction where we see her realize that she needs to calm down a bit and let other take the lead instead of over-motivate herself all the time.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing witch I didn't like was one of the themes: \"Customs are made to break\". Basiclly this says that some customs are bad and should be remade. Fair enough. But the series that aknowledge that some customs were made out of common sense and have a good reason for existing. In the show itself we only get customs witch are bad. Isn't that big of a deal, still bothered me though.\\n\\n\r\nLast thing witch bothered me was the big rescue of the witches and magic. In this world, witches experience racism against them. So the big resolution is that the people realize that witches aren't that bad and even useful. The witches accomplish this of course by killing the big bad in the series. Sounds okay, right? Well, the big problem is that the big bad is magic itself and was caused by a witch. Is a thing, witch can only solve problems that it itself has produced, a good thing? I don't think so. And the people in the world have science and machinery as an alternative (in the series science becomes of equal or even higher value than magic) so why use magic.\\n\\n\r\nThese were basiclly the reason why I took 5 points away from the show.\\n\\n\r\nTL:DR; Design and characters are pretty good, except the main character...\\n\\n\r\nHope you know if you should watch this show! Or you atleast liked my review. \\n",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Little Witch Academia. This show is not to my taste, or more specifically what it turned into wasn't. This show has some fandom behind it and I'm not a part of it, I haven't read the manga, or even watched the other movies. Everything I'm writing here will cover just this show.\r\nThe show for the first five or so episodes has a slice of life type of story. A normal person joins a prestigious school of witchcraft, and she is unable to do magic herself. Her idol is a woman named Shiny Chariot who is an unpopularwitch in the magical world who suddenly disappeared.  Her goal is to meet and be like Shiny Chariot. This of course is hard because of many things, but namely she cant do magic. \\n\\n\r\nAfter these initial episodes however the story becomes very similar to Harry Potter with a few tweaks, but I wont go more into this. This part of the story revolves around our incompetent main character while she discovers ancient words, fights against a villain, learns about herself and the one she idolizes, and learns about love, friendship...and all the other typical tropes of a shounen show. \\n\\n\r\nThis part of the story imo is fairly bad. There are large and gaping plot holes. Most of the early story plot has no buildup time either. It just poofs into existence and finishes equally as quick. It's like they were in a rush to push the story forward but I cant really understand why. The plot twist towards the end was indeed unexpected but it just gets brushed aside. It felt like most of the writing energy went into the characters and the story was rushed and patched into the show as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound were both great. The art was frankly beautiful, and fits a setting of magic and fantasy well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were great. The general cast is fun and magical. From the word go each character is given a personality that is vibrant and fun. Each character is given a decent amount of time. However this all seems to become pointless as the show continues. Akko(Atsuko Kagari) becomes pretty much the sole focus of the show and the other characters are just background noise.\\n\\n\r\nAkko is not a character type I enjoy. She is overly cheerful and stubborn, yet she has almost no ability and is constantly dragging her friends into her messes. At first her character is cute because she has drive and though she doesn't wield magic like the other girls she doesn't give up. She finds interesting ways around things, she relies on her friends who are good witches, and she grows and tries to better herself. This however stops and she just becomes an interfering character that should be nothing more than a side character or comic relief. Watching Akko work herself into her stubborn phases was incredibly annoying and the furthest thing from an endearing character.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I started this show I entered with no preconceptions and was really pleasantly surprised by what I found. The show was adorable, it had life lessons that were not shoved down your throat, the story was basic and broad. I was prepared to give it glowing reviews and high praise but then the fire nation attacked. After the first few episodes the show changes, the characters become backdrops for this new and gloriously poor story. Akko being central the story is given too much time and becomes a chore. The show seems self aware and has good moments which are killed off to keep this overarching happiness and friendship theme. \\n\\n\r\nI tried to keep this condensed and without spoilers but seriously I could rant on about how Akko is poor excuse for a main character, and how the story doesn't really work, and how the pacing felt both rushed and dragging. I wouldn't really recommend this show, but I hate that I have to say this. The first few episodes were like delicious candy that didn't rot your teeth and made you skinny. Then it becomes garbage.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Don't be fooled by first few episodes. Really a poorly written story, decent characters become backdrops, and strange pacing issues. Art is great but not worth the price of admission.",

            "content": "The TV serial edition of Little Witch Academia kicks off rather less auspiciously than the two films on which it is based, and the show navigates rough waters for a while; eventually, however, the series finds its footing and delivers a very, very Studio Trigger Christmas.\r\nLittle Witch Academia does suffer some growing pains in making the switch from short films to series.  The series moves at a slower pace, for starters, which pares away some of the initial excitement, and while the plots of the films manage to balance self-containment with implications of grander effects, the show struggles with this concept.  The ideasare too localized at first.  More than perhaps any other anime I\u2019ve seen thus far, Little Witch Academia feels like a Western cartoon; the narrative vocabulary and emotional span, for a good chunk, anyway, are very Saturday morning.  That\u2019s not necessarily a negative thing, and it\u2019s no secret that Trigger puts a lot of stock in Western influence, so that may be an accurate comparison, but the closer Little Witch Academia comes to reminding me of the cartoons of my childhood, the less it seems to challenge itself to be better and more interesting.  \\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the show is very scattershot.  Here and there we find a few hints at the show\u2019s later focus, but more often than not the episodes are parochial standalones with a small scope and a neat finish \u2013 fine for some anime, but not for Little Witch Academia, which brimmed with energy and potential in its original incarnations.  Not until roughly the halfway point does the show\u2019s true running plot unveil itself in earnest, and while that quickly becomes engaging enough to carry the rest of the season, it leaves the show feeling unbalanced.  Here we have a second half full of drama, strengthening bonds, and important missions, and then a first half pockmarked with silly excursions.  Some of the standalones are a lot of fun \u2013 the broom race, the journey to the center of Sucy, and the Constanze-centric episodes in particular, which I will enthusiastically revisit \u2013 but it really feels like the show could have been compacted into a single cour and only strengthened for it.  If the whole show had been like the second half, I would have given it an 8, and if it had been like the last four or five episodes specifically, I might have considered going higher, but those miscellaneous, directionless tangents early on make for a disappointing start and hurt the show overall.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most jarring features of the series is repeatedly seeing Sucy with all of her limbs intact.  The two films had conditioned me to believe that she exists only as a formless wisp of smoke with teeth.  This is a mere quibbling detail, and not something I really have a problem with, but it does point to a genuine disappointment: the series is less fantastical than its predecessors.  The first film in particular was so marvelously dynamic and free-spirited with its movements and facial expressions (and things like stylizing whole characters into formless blobs of mushroomoid mist).  Of course, that level of animation quality could never be sustained in the transition from film to series, much less across 25 episodes (how often does that happen?), and certainly the show does still boast high visual standards.  As far as the animation is concerned, however, the only time I ever felt some continuity with the films was in episode three, unsurprisingly the episode for which Hiroyuki Imaishi was the key animator.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, the show relies more on its sense of style to achieve memorable visuals, but it certainly possesses a unique flair.  The character designs and witch uniforms are all a pleasure to behold as they were in the films, and while those that were carried over remain the most interesting, Croix has a distinctly Trigger-y design (and of course that four-pointed star is still lying about in odd places).  The vocal performances added a lot of personality, especially Megumi Han (Akko), Michiyo Murase (Sucy), and Noriko Hidaka (Ursula).\\n\\n\r\nBy the show\u2019s end, I do feel that the relationships between Akko, Ursula, and Diana had been explored enough to make their fulfillments more rewarding than in the films, which means the show gained some understanding of how to utilize its superior space.  The films wrap everything up tidily with a nice, little bow, appropriate for a 25- or 50-minute standalone piece; the series takes notice of its ability to delve deeper into these characters, expound upon their motivations and personalities, and come out with something more resonant and impactful than before.  The bonds between those characters grow into such genuine strength that the show feels truly worth the attention by the time it\u2019s over.  This wisdom arrives only after some trial and error, however, and at the cost of pushing aside some other characters.  \\n\\n\r\nThe show tries to take advantage of its expansive run time to explore the wider world around the characters we had already been introduced to, filling out Luna Nova\u2019s faculty roster and adding a few non-magical personalities, and this is a great idea \u2013 but the show\u2019s first half is just so disjointed and episodic.  A number of those characters quickly become relegated to bit players again following their brief moments in the spotlight, leaving only the vague impression of wasted time, especially because some of them aren\u2019t particularly interesting in the first place.  Even Lotte and Sucy begin to fall by the wayside after a while.  Certainly the main character was always Akko, and the show\u2019s gravitation towards Ursula and Diana makes perfect sense, but Lotte and Sucy seem to have been promised a bigger role than what they wound up with.  I wish they had managed to maintain their grasp on the stage, because the two of them make for equally interesting characters as the other leads, if not more so.\\n\\n\r\nOnce the true narrative of Little Witch Academia reveals itself, the show becomes a lot more enjoyable.  Suddenly, the show has an endgame, the characters have goals, the pace picks up, and the tension mounts palpably from episode to episode.  It becomes the type of show whose last five episodes have to be marathoned, the type of show that wears its heart on its sleeve, that scrawls its emotional message across the sky in gigantic, sloppy letters, that pours ludicrous amounts of energy into grandiose gestures, that grabs you by the face and demands that you love and appreciate its characters and feel their struggles with your whole heart.  You know, a Trigger show.  In those moments, Little Witch Academia reaches a plane of true victorious resonance and I forget about all the qualms I had earlier in the season; I stop mentally taking notes and allow myself to become fully invested in the big, dumb, teary-eyed mission of the stubborn, earnest, pure-hearted team of kids taking charge of this crummy world once and for all.  I don\u2019t think I could look past my complaints to rate this show higher in good faith, but even if I don\u2019t think it, I certainly feel that the finale more than makes up for the missteps.  If there\u2019s a second season or another film or whatever, I\u2019m in, because that turned out to be exactly the kind of wild ride I\u2019d hoped this show would be.\\n",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nAfter Kill La Kill, I was always wondering what Trigger's next big hit would be and after seeing the first LWA short film and the Enchanted Parade, it made me think that this could be a great TV series and after finally watching it, I wasn't just surprised, I was amazed.\r\nStory (10/10)\r\nThe story follows a girl named Atsuko Kagari or Akko for short, who wants to be a witch like her idol Shiny Chariot so she can make people smile and be happy with her magic, however her journey takes her on many adventures, meeting new friends, a mysterious quest and what ittakes to be a true witch albeit a clumsy one.\\n\r\nI loved the story, I wasn't expecting it to be as fulfilling and enjoyable when I started. I was more expecting it to be jam packed with Comedy, which it was, but it was also serious when it had to be and had a lot of charm to with where the story was going.\\n\r\nThe first 10 episodes go about in a random sort of fashion, where we see Akko getting on the ropes of magic and trying to improve it while also giving some time for friends Sucy and Lotte to have a couple of episodes to each other, this was nice giving them more character development.\\n\r\nOnce you reach episode 11 however, the story really starts to settle in as Akko starts to find the missing words of the shiny rod and trying to find Shiny Chariot, new characters are also brought in, who are linked to Chariots past.\\n\r\nSome other characters also get episodes dedicated to them along with Diana who becomes a better character compared to her movie counter-parts, showing she isn't the meany she isn't cracked up to be.\\n\r\nThen we reach the final episodes which were just brilliant, I mean the episodes before were really enjoyable, but once you reach the final episodes the emotional scenes really start to get to ya and I was surprised how touching some of these scenes were, plus the show ended in a way where I felt satisfied and actually think this show doesn't need another series, because it cleared everything up.\\n\r\nI also liked how there were certain messages in there too, for example changing the old ways into the new ways isn't always a good thing and how believing in yourself is the strongest kind of magic, it's always nice to see stuff like this which create a bigger picture.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nI think the characters is the only short coming here, but it's not because any of the characters were bad, I just think a certain few didn't get the screentime I was expecting.\\n\r\nAkko is probably hands down my favourite female character from this year, because she was fantastic, sure she's clumsy, stubborn and a little irrational, but seeing her journey throughout the anime shows that she can be a caring, loving and determined person. Whenever she got stuck or kept failing she would always keep trying till she did it and she would always put her friends before herself, plus she could be surprisingly smart at times. Akko is the definition of a great character and enjoyed every moment she was one screen, although I will admit some of her decisions were a bit much.\\n\r\nSucy and Lotte are Akko's friends that she meets on the first day at the academy, these two were a great pair to team up with Akko as their reactions to her misdeeds were always funny, yet they would still follow her into dangerous situations showing how much they care about her. Lotte was the most cautious yet the smartest of the trio and would always come with a spell to help Akko out and Sucy was goddamn hilarious with her don't give a fu*k attitude and obsession with mushrooms, it was funny seeing her pick on Akko's attics, but she still cared about her none the less.\\n\r\nNow despite getting an episode each Sucy and Lotte do sorta drift in the background when the episodes started focusing more on Akko and the story which was a bit of a shame really, although luckily they start to become more of presence during the final episodes.\\n\r\nDiana is Akko's rival in some cases, but despite being her rival at first she actually does become a much better character once you find out more about her background and family history. She may look like someone who is the best at everything that she does, but she has become a person who detached themselves from something they love and Akko makes her realise that, so before you hate her character it's best to stick it out and wait for her development stages.\\n\r\nAmanda, Constanze and Jasminka are the trio that Akko and the others befriend  over time, Amanda is pretty much a tomboy, Constanze is a quiet engineer whizz and Jasminka is just a food lover. These 3 characters do provide some extra comedy and actually prove to be a bigger help to Akko than even she realises, they were enjoyable characters especially when they got an episode of their own showing the true extent of their personality.\\n\r\nI know there is other characters like Ursula, Croix and Andrew, but I'd rather keep these characters under wrap and leave some of the mystery to find out for yourself, because they were really interesting characters that push the story forward in many ways.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art team at Trigger did a fantastic job on this show, because even though it might remind you of Harry Potter, this anime still feels like it's own world and every episode had that one or more scenes that would just blow my goddamn mind, because of how amazing it looks.\\n\r\nI never doubted Trigger for one second when it came to the art department, especially after Kill La Kill, but I have to applaud them for paying very close attention to the detailing of the show and the characters look great too in the Trigger like fashion.\\n\r\nI also really liked how it was also set in the UK (much like Harry Potter), But I feel like the UK is the best place for this type of setting.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nBetween Shiny Ray and Mind Conductor it was very difficult to think which one was better, because Shiny Ray gave off that magical feeling while also feeling like it was expressing Akko's love and determination towards magic, while Mind Conductor had a more action feel to it and this did fit the second half of the series as the story really started to escalate.\\n\r\nI think Shiny Ray wins by a small margin, because it really feels like the kind of op LWA would have.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also very well done, it would always hit the right notes at the right time, like whenever Akko was giving some kind of speech the music would start to feel heroic in some way while during emotional moments the notes would have a sorrow feel making you feel sad at the same time, so the soundtrack was definitely nailed here.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to having a magical feeling, LWA definitely got it completely right, yes Magic is it's main focus, but there have been anime's or even normal TV shows and films that haven't done it very well. LWA goes into a lot of situations to do with magic that seem relatable to certain things that happen in the real world like how technology has gotten rid of many things we used to use a lot, which is something we see in LWA and seemed like a good plot point for the story, because it makes Akko realise just how vital Magic is.\\n\r\nI also really loved the Comedy too, everything Akko and her friends did that got them into trouble or made them manage to miraculously figure out a situation in the nick of time was very funny to watch, but the most important part was it's timing and it always did it at the right time, well maybe except a few times where Akko made a decision which was meant to be funny, but ended up looking a little silly, however the comedy did keep me entertained and luckily backed off when a serious or emotional moment appeared.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall Little Witch Academia is a true example of how awesome magic can be, while also giving us a fantastic story, characters, soundtrack and a beautiful artstyle which made me feel glad to see after watching how brilliant the other adaptions were, it's definitely one of my favourite anime's from this year.",

I thought the main character was obnoxious and painful to watch, and that there was no overarching plot to carry the story along. BUT it eventually picked up, it was the longest I've ever waited for an anime to pick up without dropping it, but I'm really glad that I did not drop it after-all. Around episode nine, the plot of the show is revealed, and the show grows in depth. The character begin getting more development, and the plot is interesting with little twists, and mysteries. Even the main character'soriginal explicitly obnoxious behavior is explained, and honestly I'm glad they spent so much time developing her lack of skills and stubborn nature to the degree that they did because without it, the plot of the second half the show would've been much weaker. \\n\\n\r\ntldr; Give it a shot even though the beginning feels somewhat unbearable at times, it makes up for it and explains it.  8/10\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, I never watched the movie that everyone else seems to have watched before this, so this is just a review of this show as a standalone.",

            "content": "Summary: \"You're not missing much if you don't watch Little Witch Academia, but you will be rewarded for seeing it through to the end.\"\r\nLittle Witch Academia is a series with a diverse cast of (mostly) enjoyable characters, great artwork, and a fun universe. But it fails in many ways to develop those characters and that world, leaving a generic \"filler\" feeling at the end of many episodes. The pacing of this anime is completely hot-and-cold. It starts off with a suitable introduction to the characters, and then proceeds to do nothing for about 10 episodes, and then decides it should probably work on the plotin order to scrape together an ending. Throughout, perhaps the least likeable character of the show, Akko, the protagonist, goes on a Girl Scouts badge collecting mission to learn the virtues of courage, compassion, knot-tying, etc...\\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch held such promise coming out of the OVAs, which were unique, exciting, and intriguing. But the anime makes it painfully clear that they didn't have enough content for a full series. This would have made a great 13-episode series, but as it stands, about half the series is spent wasting time, both yours and the character's.\\n\\n\r\nTo its credit, the second half of the series (about the last 8 episodes) has a good pace, an interesting plot, well-animated and well-choreographed fight scenes, and demonstrates a surprising depth of storytelling. It's the last few episodes that inspires people to reflect so strongly on the series; it closed out very well, in an almost Gurren Lagann-ian fashion.\\n\\n\r\nBut one of the main issues I have with Little Witch is that there's practically no character development throughout, despite the sum of the plot being how Akko (the main character) matures to become worthy of the world's greatest magic. There's an entire episode dedicated to Akko learning the lesson of \"patience,\" and at no point in the episode, nor after it, does she demonstrate any ability to think calmly or exercise patience as a virtue. Yet, for some reason, the show tries to ram it down your throat that she's earned the Patience Badge. It's deeply unfulfilling.\\n\\n\r\nIt's tough to give an overall rating to Little Witch Academia. This is one of the most bipolar series I have ever watched. There are good episodes, and bad episodes. There are even a couple great episodes, and overall the end provides an enjoyable climax. But the trip to get there is frustratingly mundane, and I wouldn't blame you if you dropped out early.\\n\\n\r\nI think the best way I can put Little Witch Academia is:\\n\\n\r\n\"You're not missing much if you don't watch Little Witch Academia, but you will be rewarded for seeing it through to the end.\"",

            "content": "Little Witch Academia is easily the best anime I have seen and I have seen a lot. Some of the reasons are quite subtle and people might not see the charm.\r\nIn my opinion, Little Witch Academia is a magical girl show without any disappointments. Even the smallest of scenes avoid falling into disappointing cliche results. They made this entire show optimistic and positive and I think it is really powerful with the lessons they deliver.\r\nDuring pretty much every episode, I felt like crying near the end. Everything really comes together in each episode and what seems like it would be a bad episode ends upbeing something special that imparts a lesson on the viewer. Even the main character and her development of her power deliberately teaches the viewer through the lessons/magic words that she learns.\\n\\n\r\nI would say that not one of the episodes would count as filler, but that isn't too surprising considering this was a show made without source material besides the movies. Each of the people Akko meets is charming and refreshing in their own way. Every character that Akko grows to care about is impressive and important in Akko's adventure. Even the character who didn't get enough to do (and the creator themselves said they wish more had been done with her) Jasminka, left a strong impression on me as she seemed capable in just about every situation she found herself in despite looking like someone who isn't paying much attention to anything.\\n\\n\r\nFor the mood of the show, much of the opening and ending themes are perfect. The first opening felt really cheesy at first, but it ended up being something that opened my heart to the show's pure optimism. The first ending is one of my favorites in anime... The second opening is really cliche in animations, but it is still such a good song and it really was important in marking the tone shift that happened.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the second part of the show, I think that they came up with the best possible plot twists and directions for things to go. I had no suspicion that the situation would be the way that it was, but it also fleshed out the characters and plot progression very well and made the show feel undeniably perfect.\\n\\n\r\nIt is amazing that this show also manages to feel relevant politically, even showing us a powerful solution to problems like fascism.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the characters who were the most powerful (Diana and Andrew) were depicted in a realistic way that I was very happy about. In fact, all of the characters in Little Witch Academia felt very real to me, which is part of why every episode makes me cry a bit and why Akko's small successes are so rewarding.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a definite 10/10, maybe even 11/10!\\n\\n\r\nWatch this show if you want an anime that is meaningful and educational and helps you mature.",

Mainly Lotte so far, who has her own look atthe world and want's practicly the same things as Akko, but in kind of difrent way. We won't see any type of breaking patterns or complex story, but in an anime for kids, is it actually something really bad?\\n\r\nIt all happens in Luna Nova and arounds, which is one of the most interesing locations i've seen in anime.It has it's own long magical story and at the same time really reminds of our own schools and Academics.\\n\r\nIt all is surrounded by Outstanding art style and great music. TRIGGER got used us to amazing graphic, but this series is propably their best looking tv series.

            "content": "Sigh....here we go. It has been a long time since I watched a show this good. Studio Trigger does it again with another Little Witch Academia! This time it's different compared to a show like Kill la Kill. Instead of an emotional impactful ending like Kill la Kill. We were given a more heartwarming feel good ending. Now, let's breakdown how this show was able to differ itself from Kill la Kill. \r\n Story: Our story tells the tale of one human Atsuko \"Akko\" Kagari with the believes and passion to become a great witch like her hero Shiny Chariot. Along the way she makesfriends with two other young witch Lotte and Sucy. The story first party takes an episodic approach as a way to introduce to the world of LWA, specifically Luna Nova Academy and the city it is not far from. I felt this was a good idea and not a bad approach. I know some would argue they wanted more story driven from the start, but I would argue it is better to set the scene and give life to your setting. The first half of LWA avoided two HUGE pitfalls from a narrative perspective because of this approach.(See episode 5 and episode 10). \\n\\n\r\nThe first half does a good job showing off all the goals and passions of Akko making this her story. Everything is about her journey. That's important to remember. Now the second half is more story driven as Akko finds these things known as words. The show sues this chance to pair her off with other side characters like Amanda and Constanze. This works very well for the narrative because those characters get their moments and you show how they bounce off Akko too. I will say early on I felt Akko was just being used as the punching bag, but then I realized around ep 8 and 10 where the story was. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Little Witch Academia is about Akko. It is written in the same vein kind of like Kill la Kill, but Kill la Kill flush out more than just Ryuko. This on is more focus on its main character and does a good job building the story around her. The ending of this story shows us that. That is why many were so happy for Akko in the end. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Studio Trigger joins the short list of animation studio that give you high quality and top notch artwork and set design. It is a huge treat that we an original production that is 2D handrawn from start to finish. The character design of each and every character in Little Witch academia pretty realistic for the most part outside of some monsters, but they do a good job with making a mostly female cast look different. All of them have a look and quirk to them. For example, when everyone is dress up in their witch grab has their legs showing. Sucy doesn't show her leg. \\n\\n\r\nAnother can found in the teachers as they are all varying heights and sizes. Ursula has bigger hips compared to the other teachers. The principal is very short and you don't see her legs. See what I mean? That is just a taste of the amazing art in the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation, especially the action scenes, are top notch and very exciting and intense. I really like the camera work and perspective shot they used in big magically moments. Little Witch Academia is easily one of the best animated shows of the decade along side Kill la Kill and Panty and Stocking. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I have yet to watch the English dub of this show. So, I won't be able to talk about the dub sadly. Though, I will say it has a cast that I like a lot. I look forward to hear Erica Mendez as Akko.(She was also Ryuko in the last Studio Trigger show that was dubbed.)  Now with that said, Little Witch Academia has some of the best Japanese voice acting I have heard in a while. It is usually not as sharp you get in other shows. Megumi Han does a great job making Akko cute and likable. She really shrinks her teeth into this role and makes the most of it. She is a joy to listen to and really bounces well off others. A couple of other performances I'll like to also take note is Noriko Hidaka as Ursula, Junko Takeuchi also plays one of my favorite characters but it's a huge spoiler, and lastly Yoko Hikasa as Diana. Studio Trigger did an amazing job casting for this show. \\n\\n\r\nFor music and sound design, they are also pretty topnotch and very good with music always fitting the scene and going along with the flow of the story. They really do a good job of placing the right sounds to fit every scene. They really do a good job of placing the right sounds to fit every scene. They really make sure the music doesn't overpower the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: A good show is nothing without characters. Little Witch Academia has lots of that. But keep in mind majority of the character develop is only happening to a handful of characters. Most of the cast in Little Witch Academia are playing roles that help the main character out. So yes this even goes for fans of Sucy and Lotte. They have roles to play. So this show really is gonna be up to if you like Akko or not. I love her, but I don't know everyone would like her. She is brash, loud, but has such a huge drive and passion that makes me want to root for her. So, I believe she is an affective main character. \\n\\n\r\nIn closing this show is amazing and desperately needs a season 2. I won't spoil, but I will say it didn't end like Kill la Kill. that isn't to say Kill la kill's ending was bad or anything. I am just telling you this show has more to tell and I know me and others want to see more. \\n\\n",

But this is basically a Japanese anime version of \"the worst witch\", with elements of Harry Potter (kid gets drawn into adventures due to the misbehaviour of adults, saves the day, and eventually gets recognised for their talents).\r\nIt's kids stuff, but with much MUCH deeper meanings than the afformentioned shows. As a practitioner of magick, and someone who likes to study the theory behind it, the meanings behind 7 words are actually startlingly accurate for anyone who goes through initiation/magickal growth.\r\nAs such, by the endof this anime I found myself sad that only 25 episodes were made, but satisfied by it all. I think it ended too quickly, there was so much more character growth that could of happened, there were characters who needed more expansion, and some I think needed to be introduced.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending, well, it was beautiful, it was typical anime pat, but from the experiences we had had, Akko's seemingly annoying enthusiasm and ponkotsu (clumsy) nature - well, I'll just say it pays off.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this is a light hearted magical romp, that has a beautiful message behind it, and a very satisfying final episode.",

However there is just so much charm here that it manages to somewhat make up for the show's general predictability. It never feels soulless and that is largely due to its incredibly likeable cast of characters.\r\n Atsuko Kagari is a generic yet lovable protagonist. It is easy to get invested in her ambition and drive, but she is not the perfect hero at all, being incredibly clumsy and well...not exactly the smartest characterout there. That said, it never gets to the point of being annoying or unsympathetic (in fact I found it largely entertaining) making her overall worth rooting for.\\n\r\n The supporting cast is mostly solid as well with standouts including the entertaining sociopath Sucy Manbavaran, the intriguing badass Ursula Callistis and my personal favourite Diana Cavendish, whom I found to be easily the most fascinating and well developed character in the show, whose efforts and dedication were truly admirable. Additionally, Little Witch Academia features an excellent villain, who managed to strike just the right balance between delightfully despicable and genuinely sympathetic.\\n\r\n Sadly, it is not a perfect cast. There are a few characters about whom I honestly did not care much for. Like Lotte Yansson, who just did not offer much outside of being the token cute one. Diana's two friends were unbearably annoying and unlikeable and most of Luna Nova's staff members were rather forgettable (with some obvious exceptions like the previously mentioned Ursula).\\n\r\n On the technical side, the show has a lovely soundtrack. Can't comment on Japanese voice acting because I have only seen the dub (please don't sue me) but it is actually mostly good.\\n\r\n As expected from Trigger, the art style is absolutely gorgeous and the animation is excellent (when it's not a bit choppy).\\n\r\n The shot composition is rather spot on too, with the vast majority of the shots giving the viewer something interesting and/or nice to look at making the anime a very visually appealing one.\\n\r\n Overall, Little Witch Academia is a lot of fun. Far from a masterpiece but it is just such an easily lovable show. I highly recommend watching it if you have not already. Especially if you are a fan of magical school kind of stories, but that goes without saying.",

            "content": "Plot/story 9/10\r\nThe story is based around Akko Kagari, a young girl who wants to become a witch like her idol Shinning Chariot, even though she has no witch blood in her. Akko is on her way to Luna Nova Witch Academia. During her stay at Luna Nova, Akko befriends 2 students, Lotte, and Sucy. The episodes progress well to meet the plot, but there were a few things that didn\u2019t quite fit or kind of just jumped out. The overall story was well written and left behind a great and deeper meaning.\r\nArt 8/10\r\nVisually it looks very good for the most part, but the characters withthe exception of Sucy look very similar in size and body shape. The background drawings are well detailed and drawn. It is very well animated.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is mainly made up of instrumental piece, that are very beautifully played. In my opinion the ending and opening themes we slightly slow, but fit very well with the story.\\n\r\nThe voice acting for both sub and dub was very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters are amazing and very likeable in their own ways. Akko is an amazing female lead.\\n\r\nShe's a very energetic and determined girl who wants to achieve her dreams despite her being an ordinary girl with no witch blood, she also has great character development, especially in the second half. Sucy is unsociable, and very sarcastic and likes to use Akko for her experiments, but I feel she should have gotten more screen time in the second half along with character development. Lotte is very likeable and probably my favorite character, she is very nerdy, and helpful to Akko, but along with Sucy I wish she had more screen time, and character development. Diana is a very serious witch from an extensive line of witches, but unlike Sucy and Lotte, Diana had great character development. There are a few other minor characters, that still had very good roles.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime even though it wasn\u2019t my typical anime. For me Little Witch Academia held a greater meaning than what jus meets the eye. While there were a few things that I didn\u2019t quite like with the audio and visual, the characters were great and really pushed the story along. Overall, I found Little Witch Academia very enjoyable. I give it an 8.9/10\\n",

            "content": "This is a show i will not be forgetting anytime soon i can tell you that for sure. \r\n~~Spoilers~~\r\n Characters: \r\n   Akko: Tends to get way too nosy about other peoples business. She has the mentality that if she doesn't think this is what people actually want than she will go and do what she thinks is best for them ( You know, A very annoying character trait) When i compare her to other characters in the show. I just can't really get behind her as the one who is actually deserving of all this attention she gets. We have two other charactersin the show (Diana) (Chariot)  These two are more deserving of these powers cause they actually seem like they have worked for it.\\n\\n\r\n  Diana: At first i thought she was gonna be the typical know it all girl that's also stuck up. But she is my second favorite character in the show actually. She is caring and isn't rude to others. She can be blunt though. But she has spent her entire life working on magic and has put a ton of effort into magic stuff. She even had to go and learn how to do magic all over again. I personally feel that she is a character who is more deserving of the special magic Akko got. \\n\\n\r\n  Chariot: Is by far my favorite character. I really wish she was the focus of the show and not Akko. By far one of the most interesting stories. Imo more likable than any other character. She also has over of my favorite character designs i'v seen. I also feel that she should have been the one to use the special magical powers and not Akko. She was the original owner of the magical rod. I also feel that the story should have ended on her being the last to use the power .\\n\\n\r\nArt: I love this art style. I feel if it wasn't for the art style i don't think this would have grabbed my attention the first episode. \\n\\n\r\n~~ Spoilers Over~~ \\n\\n\r\nI really loved this show. Even if i do get annoyed at times with the MC. This is defiantly gonna be something i remember for awhile .\\n\\n",

            "content": "An easy 10 in my opinion.\r\nEver since watching the movie i've been wishing they would make an anime, and here it is. I think people who say \"this anime is way too overrated\" forgot what anime is. It's a vast collection of uncountable genres. Definitely not overrated, but perhaps unappreciated enough.\r\nThis anime is for those who want to laugh. Akko, Lotte and Sucy's shenanigans are top notch. They will never leave you bored even for one second.\r\nIt's for those with a sense of adventure. Because LWA is a story about wonderful adventures of all of the characters. We even get to see the past ofher rival, Diana, and her own adventure. In that sense the story does not focus only on Akko.\\n\r\nIt's for those who love following a character which grows and evolves throughout the anime. (literally all of them)\\n\r\nIt's for those who have an open mind and want positivity in their life. \\n\r\nAs easy as that. This anime is nothing but pure good. It brings a warm feeling every time I watch it. And I highly suggest you to watch this anime if you just want to take a break from all those horror/mystery animes.\\n\\n\r\nStory: They made a story, mixed it with some fillers here and there, but nothing really feels like a filler, because our protagonist Akko, is always trying, always learning and always evolving. It feels natural and intriguing. Every few episodes we seem to get closer to what the story actually is about, and I love it! The fact that you can even enjoy the fillers is something which shows how well the show is made.\\n\\n\r\nArt: F.A.N.T.A.S.T.I.C. &lt;--- I'm a sucker for god art and imho this is great. \"Trigger\" Brings us yet another masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Music is fab. Usually I skip the OP and ED, but I just can't. It's just too good. Michiru \u014cshima's hard work really shines here. Check her work out if you have a spare moment!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There's development, small amount of flat characters. Everyone's changing and developing. It's important to notice that Yoh Yoshinari who wrote the Manga also directed the anime, thus bringing it as close to canon as possible, and managed to convey the character's feelings properly. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10. I recommend it to anyone! Both beginners and intense anime lovers :D\\n",

            "content": "Contains spoilers. Please excuse my writing, this isn't really something I'm good at but after an experience like this I feel like I need to say something.\r\nA simple girl has a simple dream of meeting her childhood idol. Sounds pretty linear, right? Wrong. It's so much more than that. From a fun little show about a young witch aspiring to bring smiles on people's faces with magic, we got something that might as well be called lessons of life. It's a serious understatement if I say that this show got me by surprise. This review might not be about the show itself as much asabout what it is trying to say. I'm not a creative person so I'll just split this into 7 points, each representing one of the words of Arcturus and what they mean *to me*.\\n\\n\r\n\"Those that try to achieve their dreams must go through hardships. There may come times when you fail and lose sight of that dream. But you must never let the flame in your heart go out. Burn that flame brightly, and strive for your ideal place\" or Noctu Orfei Aude Fraetor:\\n\r\nFirst of all I know the \"official\" translation is \"Strive for your ideal place\" but I like this version much more. Noctu Orfei Aude Fraetor is the most meaningful word of the 7 for me. Sure, this basically says \"never give up\" which is a massive clich\u00e9 at this point but the author's way with the words makes it so much more special. Life has ups as well as downs. It is only natural that sometimes things don't go your way and you feel like giving up on everything. That's why it's important that you never forget what you're going for and keep on fighting. In real life, dreams often don't come true, but one must have faith and find themselves a place in life where they're happy, even if it's not what they dreamed of in the first place.\\n\\n\r\n\"You do not get the things that you dream of, you get the things you work for\" or Phaidoari Afairynghor:\\n\r\nPretty similar to the first word in my opinion. I don't think this one needs much more to say. Simply, it's no surprise when your dreams don't come true, because they are not achieved by dreaming but by working and putting in effort. A good reality is much better than an amazing (unreal) desire.\\n\\n\r\n\"Do not compare yourself with others, do what only you can do\" or Arae Aryrha:\\n\r\nEveryone has their own reality. Everyone perceives life differently. It's what makes us diverse. You can't be good at everything and so can't anybody. You're good at something, that person is good at something else, but they can't do what you can and so on. Comparing yourself with others often ends in thinking that you're worse than everyone around you, because you only see the bright sides and don't realize everybody has their own insecurities however confident they may look.\\n\\n\r\n\"To see it through, patience is important\" or Mayenab Dysheebudo:\\n\r\nNothing important in your life ever happens day to day. And it's probably as it should. If you achieved everything immediately could it be even considered an achievement then?\\n\\n\r\n\"When traditional and modern powers mingle, the gate to an unseen world will open\" or Sybilladura Lelladybura: \\n\r\nDon't forget where you come from because it's half of who you are. Too much of anything is bad so the balance between what was, what is, and what will be needs to be found in order to see new things you didn't realize before. \\n\\n\r\n\"Thank you\" or Lyonne:\\n\r\nSimplest and shortest one, yet crucial. I admit, sometimes I'm guilty of not going by this. It often seems unnecessary and insignificant. To express gratefulness to ones that helped you on your way is the smallest thing you can do for them, yet it can mean a great deal. Saying thank you is the tiny bit of magic we actually do have in this world.\\n\\n\r\n\"Connect with other people, and your dreams will grow\" or Phasansheer Shearylla:\\n\r\nYou can barely achieve anything by yourself. While it's true it is you who needs to be persistent in order to move somewhere further, it is highly unlikely you can do so without people you value.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully this wasn't as boring as it looks. In conclusion, I value this show greatly, it had the right amount of just everything. I overuse the word \"literally\" quite a bit but when I say LWA is literally flawless I mean it. There wasn't a minute when I was bored, it always had something to offer. Earlier on it was light-hearted comedy, later the story and characters started to develop etc. For a time, I felt like I'm part of it, which is something, I seek in everything I watch. I'll miss the show and I'm looking forward to rewatching it sometime. Obviously 10/10.",

I cried from the happy feeling I feltin some episodes... And from the sad in others.

However in the end, I was left feeling that the anime was just ok.\r\nThe story, while not bad, did not do much in drawing me in. There wasn't much story progression until the second half of the anime with the first half mainly consisting of slice of life moments centered around the lives of the young witches at the academy as they learned the Ins and Outs of magic.\r\nThe art and animation is instantly recognizable asthat of Studio Trigger and in this regard I felt like it was both beautiful and unique.\\n\r\nThere were good characters in Little Witch Academia although they were a little bit cliche in the way they were portrayed and in how they interacted with each other.\\n\r\nEven though this anime has a lot of good points to it, I simply wasn't able to enjoy the show overall. So in closing I can recommend that Little Witch Academia is at least worth giving the first couple episodes a try to see whether it would be one for you or not.",

            "content": "This is an abomination.\r\nThis anime has been compared to My Hero Academia left and right, but I'm not seeing it. Aside from an underdog kid being put in a special school, there's like, no similarities. Hero Aca starts off by actually introducing the main characters instead of showing some cookie-cutter bullshit flashback that doesn't answer the  important question of \"how is the character changed in this moment\". That's what a flashback is supposed to do, but instead, it just says \"Girl thinks magic is cool, fuck you\". Hero Aca is boring in the beginning, but it serves its purpose and substantially increases the longevityof the show. Witch Aca, however, decides to save the backstory and character development for later and just throw the MC into the fray. Unfortunately, actually caring what happens to the MC is pretty important if you want the viewer to tune in to the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was fine in this show, but I think it's kind of dull, especially for a show about magic. I see no reason for this show to not be bursting with color when it's not even supposed to be bound by the chains of reality. Also, there are these strange off-putting pauses and shots that last way too long. For instance, the zoom in on the moon from the flashback. That shot went on for 3 seconds too long. \\n\\n\r\nI hate the main character's voice. In contrast, I think the dull-pink haired girl has a nice, not suicide-provoking voice. Still, fuck the MC's voice.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the worst thing in the first episode other than the plot, or lack-thereof. For instance, why is the dull-pink haired girl so hostile to the MC without any provocation? Why do the glasses-girl and the MC get along so quickly despite the MC nearly fucking everything up for glasses-girl? Why the hell is the MC so hyper and giddy? I don't even remember the MC and glasses-girl giving proper introductions, but they're calling each other by name in a later scene. Maybe I'd just fallen asleep by that point because the story moves so sloooowwllyyyy. The entire first episode is about the MC's trip to fucking school. \\n\\n\r\nI feel like my time was intentionally being wasted.\\n\\n\r\nComparing this to Hero Aca is blasphemy. 8/10 rated; what a joke.\\n\\n\r\n3/10. Wasted potential.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review. \r\nI usually don't watch shows that have \"witch\" in their title. I first decided to watch Little Witch Academia because of the art and color palette used in the poster! And my instinct was spot on. Little Witch Academia's strength is in its art and animation. That is not saying that the story is its weakness but it is lacking in terms of complexity of plot and characterization. \r\nThe main character, Kagari Atsuko, aspires to be a great witch like her idol Shiny Chariot. Although she is an ordinary person (as in not a witch by blood), she tries herhardest to achieve her dream. In these kind of stories, there is always an element of fate or destiny so you can expect a few revelations of that sort eventually. It's a simple stereotype story and its slow pacing doesn't do it any favors. The show so far is mostly episodic but with hints of its overarching plot embedded in each ep so that it won't feel disjointed. Humor is an essential part of the anime. In my opinion it almost changes the main genre from a fantasy to a comedy! The carefree nature of the main character and her silliness affects her surroundings to the point where you can't take the story too seriously and as a result, it redeems its thin and simplistic plot. \\n\r\nStory: 6 | Fair\\n\\n\r\nAside for the main character, character development is almost nonexistent in regards to supporting characters. However, the story isn't finished yet, not to forget that it is slow-paced so there's still hope. With hardships on the MC's path, there is bound to be growth of character. no matter how small that develoment is, it is important for the character to reach her goal. She learns that asking for solutions and answers to her problems is too easy and working hard and believing in herself is more rewarding. She also learns that it is okay to do thigns her way instead of comparing herself to others or watning to be exactly like her idol. The same with almost all anime MCs, she doesn't know how to give up; she is stubborn as hell and that's what brings the others around her. \\n\r\nCharacters: 6 | Fair\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation is what brought Kagari to life as well as the world of LWA. The art is what initially attracted me to the anime. It works so well with Kagari that I cannot imagine her character portrayed any other way. the roundish design of the characters as well as the lack of sharp lines help the audience feel at ease watching the anime. I'm never at the edge of my seat because this isn't that kind of show. It's warm,soft, silly and magical. \\n\r\nThe setting is as good as character design. Although, the world of LWA doesn't feel original to me, it doesn't mean that it's not crafted with brilliant imagination. Couple the art with the beautiful and fluid animation and you get an animated magic spectacle. I think that's what the animators were going for. It is important to mention that the high quality of the animation is maintained in every episode unlike most titles these days especially compared to long-running series. \\n\r\nperhaps it's just me but I think the art and animation are very close to ghibli's style. Well, I'm no expert so i might be wrong.\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 9 | Great\\n\\n\r\nLWA's score is exclusively orchestral which suits the fantasy genre well. There isn't a piece that sticks out but also there isn't one that attracts your attention as being out of place. The whole score meshes well with the animation and story. There might have been an instance where they used a classical piano piece in-script and it served as score for a sequence where Kagari chases after a mosquito which was cool. OP & ED also fit the story and the nature of the anime. Personally I'm not very fond of the songs but I do like the animation. \\n\r\nSound: 7 | Good\\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia was able to make me forget the real world for 20 mins every episode and show me a great spectacle of animation which I rarely see with such consistency nowadays (last one i've seen was Mod Psycho 100). It's the title's redeeming feature. Without such art and animation style, I bet LWA would have been a medioce bore. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 | Great\\n\\n\r\nSorry for the messy structure. I was never good at writing but i can't get better without actually writing so there you have it, my first review. any ideas or feedback is appreciated. thank you for reading. \\n\r\nOVERALL: 7 | Good",

While it does serve the purpose of character building, I fail to get emotionally attached to any of the characters. \r\nIn its redeeming faith however, what seemed like a inane, pointless story about the episodic adventures of Akko and friends is that- at the 21st episode- all the plot holes andseemingly silly hyperbolic things seen in the previous episodes are all explained.",

            "content": "Each person has different reasons to see or read a story that caught their attention. Some are based on the poster, trailer or character design, others on the staff in charge, producer or studio that does it. Whatever the reason, we all have a weakness to see that the story will contain a certain element that we love. In this case, I personally like stories with witches and that's why when I saw that Trigger's OVAS were going to have an anime, it was my priority to see it, now let's see if Little Witch Academia fulfilled its purpose.\r\nWhat is Little Witch Academy about?\r\nAtsuko Kagari(Akko) is a girl whose only desire is to become a witch like her idol Shiny Chariot. That's why she enrolled in the Luna Nova Academy of Witchcraft, to learn and become as great as her. Its only drawback is that she is useless for magic to such an extent that she can not do the simplest things like flying or using basic spells. Although not all is lost because on her first day Chariot's rod appears and decides that from that moment she will try her best to fulfill her dream.\\n\\n\r\nA story with a questionable rhythm\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe whole plot will be handled through an episodic style solving the problem of the week. It may work for you at first because it does not seem to be more than that. Although from the first chapter we can see that at some point it will take the serialized form, which it does, but without leaving the problems of the week. The drawback with this narrative is that the rhythm of the episodes is very inconsistent, some scenarios will have such a construction that when you reach the climax it will feel rushed causing an unsatisfactory conclusion. Some will have a decent pace to have the right time for each moment, but these are a minority with respect to others. At the same time, the series takes time to give consistency to the chapters, it is true that several of the first half have repercussions in the future avoiding creating the Deus ex Machina strictly, however, seeing that most are autoconclusive and that until the second half they appear only to fulfill a purpose, they do not feel so natural. The anticipation is appreciated, but it is still a convenience that could be better used. The chapters are entertaining to watch, in the end they leave you wanting more, although it is more for haste instead of being a good chapter.\\n\\n\r\nThe story will use two elements to be interesting and keep the audience: the issues it deals with and the humor. With the first we find several during the entire anime, however, to treat them it falls short. The main one will be to chase for your dreams and that \"to believe is your magic\", which will rub on your face during most of the chapters. There would be no problem with that but because they say it so directly, it loses the naturalness in the plot and becomes almost a lesson, bordering on what was done before in the cartoons. Others such as traditions, the clash of the traditional with the modern, the vision of witches and magic, all are shown and mentioned on several occasions, but they never have a conclusion that we could consider interesting because they are left to a side or solved conveniently. Luckily, comedy is handled very well, situations, dialogues and reactions are entertaining, managing to get several laughs for their humor. It has to its favor that it is ingenious because each situation is different and a few times will be repeated avoiding saying the same joke several times. The topics covered, despite being left out or be purely exposure without quite naturalness in the plot, along with its humor will manage to keep you in front of the screen if you do not expect much, it is a simple series that fails to become complicated or have depth, but that does not makes it unbearable to watch, because its comedy is more than enough reason to see it.\\n\\n\r\nSimple secondary characters and a hardly acceptable protagonist\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are interesting, but they feel like a wasted resource. For now we will leave Akko aside to talk more in depth later. The secondary ones have a unique charisma, however, they leave aside the development. It is true that all, or the great majority, will have their chapter where they will be the focus of attention, but they never say anything relevant about them, they only confirm what we already knew about their personalities. In a matter of development we could only mention Sucy with the chapter when they enter her mind, which gives us an interesting insight into her personality and friendship with Akko. While in evolution we have Diana, who would be the best character in the series. She may have childish motives, but due to her conflicts and situation you can get to empathize with her making the chapters that are dedicated to her the best of the anime. On the other hand, the villain does not appear until the middle of the anime, removing some weight. Besides, her actions become contradictory, at one moment she wants to get rid of her nemesis and the other, she is saving her for sentimental reasons that appear out of nowhere. It's not a joke, you just can not take it as someone who deserves respect, it's a shame that she left a lot to be desired. Finally, in secondaries, we have Ursula, a teacher with a secret that she reveals  and gives way to something that could have been better managed to give a great development, although she is well worked is not the big thing and remains as something mediocre (not good not bad).\\n\\n\r\nNow we have the protagonist, Akko, and all the points, both positive and negative, that comes with her. From the beginning she makes clear her motivations and personality, although this is also where the problems begin. Throughout the series she will remain the same, they will never show us anything more of her, all her actions and decisions will be related to her like for magic and admiration towards Chariot. It would not be bad if it were not because she never changes, even with the revelation mentioned above does not seem to have some kind of change in her attitude. It is annoying that during all the time she remains as a one-dimensional character, especially because she is the protagonist, that is, she should be the one who has more construction. Being so short would work if she were a secondary character or if the series did not seek to be taken seriously several times.\\n\\n\r\nAnother drawback comes to light with the advance of the episodes, her desire to help quickly go from altruism to obstinacy, because she never listens to reasons and only thinks on what she believes it is right, so that in the end she ends up being right, making her annoying over time, leading to another problem. In many parts Akko seems like a Mary Sue because she is always right, nobody corrects her and when they do it, in the end it turns out that she was right. Apart, all the attention goes to her, this is technically good for being the main character, however, here it happens in an exaggerated way. Everyone asks what she is doing, where she is, if she must do or need something, the vast majority of things happen by or for her, monopolizing all the attention.\\n\\n\r\nThe only positive thing that she has, apart from her funny scenes, is her inability to use magic, that over time she improves little by little through effort and will. During conflicts, she manages to use her few resources to get out of difficulties in an ingenious way. Although she has a plot-device that will help her with great magical power, it is not so recurrent to lose the tension and creativity of the moments, even in the end she uses what she learned in the best possible way, so it is a great point to keep in mind in her construction. Akko is someone you love or hate, you can hold it and laugh at her craziness, it's easy to get attached to her, but you could not consider her a good character because of the little construction she has.\\n\\n\r\nStriking technical section\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is simply spectacular. Beyond having a good fluency during the combats and the use of magic, the prize takes it as how they use it for humor. In simple terms it would be considered expressive in a caricatured way, much comedy is based on the expressions of the characters and their movements during situations that arise. Each character will be deformed or distorted when moving, this beyond being bad animation is actually part of the crazy and fantastic style that manages. At the same time it will have scenes where the epic will stand out, the parts that have a great attention to detail and that without using CGI manage to make them look so fluid, some even surprise you that it have maintained the traditional animation. Watching the series just for the animation is a good choice because it is a festival of exaggerations and extravagances that impress you and constantly makes you laugh, that is, what more can be expected from the studio that brought us Kill la Kill ?, It may not be that level of madness, it even seems that the quality goes down on some occasions, but Little Witch Academia earns its identity as a worthy anime for Trigger.\\n\\n\r\nAs for music, it could not be considered beyond environmental. It has a magical fantasy style that goes well with the whole context. It really is a decent job because it does not end up being flashy, but it is not disposable either, the series would not be the same without it. The openings and endings unfortunately do not pass beyond generic, they may sound good, however, do not excel in any way. As for the section of the soundtrack it does a decent job, it may sound good in some moments becoming more prominent, however, it is better to listen to it with the anime instead of doing it separately.\\n\\n\r\nA fun anime to pass time.\\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia is easy to recommend, but not for being good. You can constantly laugh at its excellent comedy and animation, because they are its strongest points. Unfortunately, it remains a lot to be owed for its characters and rhythm in most chapters. Although do not doubt that you can sympathize with the witches, without a doubt, they are charismatic with a funny personality that will make you want more. Reasons to see it are not lacking, it can be enjoyed if you let go of several things, however, its failures become significant enough to not let them pass. This is an anime that is style over substance, it is not bad, but neither could be said otherwise. I would give it a 6.5/10.\\n\\n",

The show doesn't seem to do anything of real interest until the introduction of the 7 words. I feel if they would have shown this plot and the antagonist from the early episodes (after the usual introduction episodes) and then expanded on this, and in more details of say word origins, more of the world backstory such as the rest of the 9 witches etc. The story would have been vastly more captivating and heldmy attention more. Granted i have nothing against the silly episodic episodes that a lot of anime have. Its just in this case i feel it wasn't necessary from the jump.",

            "content": "Hello Trigger.\r\nI see you've made another Trigger animu with the Trigger art style and the Trigger over the top style.\r\nWait no, you didn't. You applied your art style to a fairly generic anime story with no over the top-ness. Huh.\r\nWell however you wanna play it.\r\nLittle Witch Academia is what happens the eternally bombastic Trigger decides to be more restrained and do a story that doesn't end up referencing Gurren Lagann so much that it ends on the intergalatical scale.\r\nAnd unlike the other anime that tried that ( the forgettable Kiznaiver ), Little Witch is SURPRISINGLY VERY GOOD.\r\nAfter the absolutely entertaining yet very messy and pointlessKill la Kill, who in my eyes cemented Trigger as that studio where all the visual artists go but they have nobody to write a story that actually is worth reading, and Kiznaiver who had a pretty bleh plot and story, and everything else as well I saw from them, I just expected this one-time movie to crash in the plot and characters department when turned into a full fledged double season anime.\\n\\n\r\nWell LWA is good. It just is. The characterisation was far better than expected, there is actual depth that makes sense, and it is as well animated and supported by an excellent soundtrack as one might expect from Trigger. Only the plot takes this down from a 9 to an 8.\\n\\n\r\nWell rather the plot and the (usual?) Trigger pacing. It seems like LWA divides itself yet again into the part that's entirely about world and character building, from episode 1 to episode 14 roughly. Around episode 14 the plot actually starts and it is...bleh. Meh.\\n\\n\r\nNot terrible but it has several problems: one is that it's just generally poorly paced. Episode 14 is something like 10 episodes too late. At the end of the anime, I felt like a lot of time that should've been given to flesh out or build up some of the final battles were just missing.\\n\r\nTwo is its very unpleasant habit of not justifying some of the characters' lack of action. Why does Ursula not say ANYTHING against Croix for so long? Being ashamed of her past history does not in any way justify her silence. Just make up a convenient lie, or at the very least ask Akko to be wary, or something. It feels like a plot that can only work because the characters are too dumb/immobile to react to obvious threats.\\n\r\nAnd three, it's just not a great plot. It has a few nice twists and things I did not expect would go down the way they did, but even that doesn't really make it any good. Just made it go from a very generic/boring plot to a boring plot with a few good twists that amuse.\\n\\n\r\nApart from the plot, LWA is just overall nice really. I don't really have a \"critique\" on it for once, simply because every complaint would feel like nitpicking.\\n\\n\r\nAre the characters well fleshed out and developed? Yes. Is the world too? Yes. Does the story make sense? Mostly, apart from several actions or lack thereof from Ursula. Was there a thing that made me wanna stop binging this? Yes I guess, one Ursula stupid moment. But that really didn't stop me long, I still binged the whole thing in 2 days.\\n\\n\r\nSo I could go at length into how Lotte and Sucy are sort of abandoned in part 2 and the whole friendship gang of Akko drifts further away to the Constanze team, how the rivalry with Diana is twisted into a great friendship story but how then she feels like she should have been given more screen time(mainly because she turns into a friend late due to the aforementioned pacing problems), I could explain my slight distaste at Trigger seemingly always doing this unpleasant thing of developping the world at length in part 1, then only having an actual plot going somewhere in part 2(again, quite like KLK), I could bitch and moan about how part 1 is my favorite every time and that they would have probably succeeded better in my eyes by doing a simple feel-good anime with no plot, just world building and enjoyable character development and growth, I could bitch about Akko being adorable yet being another Naruto, a loudmouth with no talent who tries real hard but has no real ability, I could have rechecked my lessons instead of spending my entire weekend on this, and then waste more time on a review...\\n\\n\r\nBut eh.\\n\\n\r\nLWA just doesn't summon my usual desire to poke sticks at anime things.\\n\\n\r\nIt is good. It would be a great 9/10 anime, same as Kill la Kill, if it had had a halfway decent plot instead of a poor one.\\n\\n\r\nIt offers a charming, interestingly animated, enjoyable world full of well done characters, and can be showed to children or adults(by which I mean weeaboos) with no restraints.\\n\\n\r\nYou should watch it if you have time to spare. Expect above average entertainment, expect above average animation, above average characters, and above average music, and if you're like me, you'll be just quaint with it and walk out of it satisfied.",

            "content": "At least, up to a certain point of our lives we all chase after lofty dreams. But the cruelty of life slowly saps away at our will to dream and strive to achieve them. We, for the most part, abandon them. That is what differentiates us from Kagari Atsuko aka Akko, the main heroine of Little Witch Academia.\r\nIn the world of LWA is a world of magic or to be more apt, a world where magic is declining. And yet Akko tries to attend a school for Witches. So she can fulfill her dreams of becoming like her idol, Shiney Chariot. And yet the momentshe arrives at the school, she learns that her idol is actually considered to be a hack and she herself lacks any talent for magic. And yet she presses on, with her stubborn demeanor, refusing to accept her weakness and most importantly refusing to give up. And thus she meets friends and rivals who are each attracted to her rather intriguing personality.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the introductions LWA follows an episodic structure till the half way of its run. Each episode Akko finds herself in some zany adventure regarding magic. These episodes are often themed around her friends. After the halfway point, reality starts to hit. The actual consequences of trying to achieve ones dreams are introduced. At the same time an arch villain shows up and disrupts the joyful adventurous nature of the show and adds in intrigue. Culminating in a fantastic climax that can only called awesome.\\n\r\nAs usual studio Trigger brings a fantastic visual style to the show. LWA looks distinct from every show that came out this year. The characters all have wonderful expressive animations. Meanwhile the action sequences can become outright insane in complexity and creativity. They even have a tendency to sneak in a few cheeky references in pretty much every major scene. The soundtrack is more focused on suiting various scenes instead of just on a specific theme. Though the classical music portion of the soundtrack is more noticeable as they are used in the Academy, where most of the story takes place in.\\n\r\nAnd at last it\u2019s hard not to give a shout out to Diana Cavendish, the most well developed, well rounded and likable rival character since Kiryuin Satsuki. Both her and Akko\u2019s growth throughout the story is what grounds the compelling aspect of the story.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps it isn\u2019t too late to chase our dreams. Well even if it is, Little Witch Academia will try to persuade you otherwise. And even if you are not convinced, you\u2019ll have a good time experiencing the attempt. It is beyond a doubt one of the best shows of the year.\\n\\n",

I maybe would have liked to see some of the other students get a little more devlopment but with the length of the show I think they did as much as they could and even with that I would still say this isa great show overall and would highly recommend it to fans of magical girls, cute girls doing badass things, or inspiration stories.",

            "content": "Little Witch Academia:\r\nFirst and foremost, this is one of the most beautifully animated and most colorful shows I've ever had the pleasure of watching. every single second of animation feels like a wonderful eye massage that leads to a happy ending. lets tackle the individual parts of this show \r\nThe characters+story:\r\nWhile the hardly original \"I wanna be X\" clich\u00e9 has been done to death, LWA manages to have fun with the idea by having the main Protagonist, Akko be actually terrible at everything aside from the climax of an episode. She moves to Luna Nova to become a witch and despite having no magical prowessto speak of, she desires to be like her idol Shiny Chariot. surrounded by a crew composed of a girl obsessed with mushrooms and brewing, Susy, and a shy introvert named Lotte, while the show has a colorful supporting cast, they all can be summed up in one or two sentences. this is by far the weakest part of LWA the supporting cast is composed of mostly certain tropes that really don't anything creative with the idea other than \"theyre witches\" Akko and her rival in the series Diana are far and away the best characters in the show aside from Akkos mentor Ursula. While the show doesn't do anything wrong with its characters its doesn't do anything to push them or the clich\u00e9 they are apart of further and both the story and characters earn a 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: this is the real meat and potatoes of the show, easily some of the best, fluid, colorful and fun animation and music Trigger has done period. if you're an art person or a visual person you will adore this show no matter what. Shiny Ray, the OP starts on a beautiful image of the shows title being carved out of magic and leads to, while not a perfect or revolutionary, very well directed OP. there is nothing else to describe the show visually other than downright gorgeous and the music accompanying it just accentuate the show more 10/10 in both without question \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: if you love watching cute witches do cute witch things/ a highschool girl who isn't good while her peers around her succeed and her struggle to keep up with them, or just want to watch something fun and light hearted, absolutely give it a go. 10 from me. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: normally I would average everything together and if I were to do that this show would get an 8. for me however, the visuals and clear passion that went in put me in a position where I feel id be doing a disservice to the show by scoring it anything less than a 10. the visuals especially are just so damn good. having rewatched this show twice and starting a third Id feel bad about giving this anything less than a 10 overall. give it a watch especially if you love the visual style trigger is known for, you will love the bright expressive colors and characters. 10",

            "content": "Presentation/Animation 10/10: Holy shit, have I never been so enraged reading words written about the collection of pixels I watched accompanied by audio. The myriad [I love that word] complaints about the \"lackluster special effects\" or \"inconsistent animation\" will haunt me until I die, and probably even after. Moving on to the actual reviewing. It's by far and away the best animation of 2017 and were it released in 2016 would give Mob Psycho 100 a good match. Oh wait, Mob's ugly? Oh right, since I can't use it as my 4K anime wallpaper desktop background. Right. Anyway, great soundtracks. Openings are pretty good (7/10IS NOT what should come to mind) and the difference in tone of the first/second OP is great.    \\n\\n\r\nStory/Character 10/10: Why are people on this site so focused on character depth and plot complexity? Is it impossible to enjoy a simple story with a lovable cast of characters? What I love about this is that the undeniably simple characters in My Hero Academia are labeled as \"charming and believable\" while Little Witch Academia gets marked as \"boring, predictable and 1-dimensional\". The plot is NOT clich\u00e9, anyone who says this is clearly a pleb in an elitist's wolf skin pretending to only enjoy \"smart\" anime. Pathetic! Can you actually name another anime which follows a strikingly similar plot line? That's the definition of clich\u00e9 you know. So after my tirade on MAL reviewers and how they're all objectively wrong, we move onto... continuing this rant. I mean, at least it's not as bad as the tragedy that is Hibike! Euphonium's score or Hoshi wo Ou Kodomo, but whatever. Okay NOW it's over.\\n\\n\r\nMAL Reviews/Reception 0.125/10: At least people bothered to attempt using their brain to think about the show? Clearly not enough to realize basic concepts such as \"wait a minute I don't have to analyze a show for 40 minutes for it to actually be good\" or \"am I so pretentious that every anime that features cute girls is automatically 2/10 moe slice of life trash\". Actually scratch that I change my rating of the other MAL reviews to a 0.0675/10. Meticulously calculated. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "One trope that anime uses time and time again is the underdog story. In which the main character is a nobody who has a dream, is told they can\u2019t do it, but they work hard and believe and they achieve their goals. While this is a very good message to younger viewers, for anime veterans such as myself, it kind of gets old after awhile, so a show like this something special to stick out from all the rest. And Little Witch Academia delivered on that and more.\r\nStory: 7/10 The story of Little Witch Academia follows Akko Kagari. A young girl who has a dreamof becoming a witch like her idol, Shiny Chariot. To do this, she attends the prestigious school for witches, Luna Nova. She quickly finds out, however, that it\u2019s very tough for her to fit in there. She can\u2019t perform magic nearly as well as everyone else and she can\u2019t even fly on a broomstick. As such she gets bullied a lot by her classmates. Especially a snobbish girl named Diana Cavendish and her 2 friends. Despite this, Akko still believes in herself and still tries to improve as a witch. There is one major flaw with the story though. It takes forever for any major plot points to kick in. The first 10 or so episodes feel more like episodic adventures of Akko and her two friends Lotte and Sucy getting into mischief or going on a crazy adventure. It isn\u2019t until the second half when the true plot kicks in, when Akko\u2019s teacher Ursula tells her that she needs to find the seven words of Arcturus in order to give the Shiny Rod (a wand that was owned by Chariot and is now inherited by Akko) magic power. It is then that Akko\u2019s adventure truly begins. While the more episodic first half is fine and very fun to watch, I feel like it didn\u2019t need to drag on as much as it did and it caused many people I\u2019ve talked to to drop the show early. Once the plot kicks in though, it\u2019s truly magical (pun intended)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 Studio Trigger is no stranger to unique and quirky art styles, so needless to say, this anime looks great. Obviously it isn\u2019t animated as good as the OVA and short film, but considering this is a 24 episode TV series I can forgive that. The art is very vibrant and colorful and really sucks you into the world of this anime. Coupled with unique, standout character designs and many different locations that the characters visit, you better believe that this anime will hook you in with the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 The soundtrack to this anime is very fitting for a show like this. The songs sound magical and mysterious, yet upbeat and charming at the same time. Both opening songs are very upbeat and motivating songs to emphasize the \u201cfollow your dreams\u201d message that the anime has. The voice acting is very good too. Each character has a unique standout voice that reflects their personality making each one recognizable. All in all, very little complaints with the sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10 Little Witch Academia excels with its characters. I\u2019ve already mentioned Akko, so let\u2019s talk about some of her friends. Lotte is the brains of the group and is a major bookworm. Sucy is very monotone and obsessed with mushrooms, Diana is a know it all snob that is respected by everyone at the school and may or may not contribute to Akko\u2019s life, we have Ursula who is Akko\u2019s mentor and has a huge secret about her that I won\u2019t dare spoil for you, and I would talk about Crois, but I don\u2019t want to get into spoiler territory here. Some characters could have gotten a bit more screen time and development, but nothing too major. Other than that, Little Witch Academia handled its characters very well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 This show was a joy to watch every Monday back in the Winter and Spring 2017 seasons. The first half is fun to watch just to see what antics Akko and her friends will get into in each episode, and the second half is even better as we get to see Akko\u2019s journey to find the seven words and even get a few VERY shocking reveals along the way. All in all, this anime was a joyride all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10. Little Witch Academia had its share of issues such as the first half feeling more like a drag plot wise and some characters not getting enough screen time, but even then, the good definitely outweighs the bad and we get an inspirational story about following your dreams and working to improve yourself instead of trying to be like others. I highly recommend you watch this with a younger kid, as this show is appropriate for all ages (for the most part) and the message will definitely speak to a younger audience as well as an older one as well. Thank you for reading.",

            "content": "The reason why I started watching Little Witch Academia is quite simple to explain. I was neither especially hyped for the show, nor did I have particularly high expectations for it to be outstandingly good at all. It was just that I noticed the colorful and inviting logo of Little Witch Academia while scrolling on Netflix. This show really looked like light-hearted and uncomplicated fun to me, so I gave it a try. \r\nAnd guess what\u2026that\u2019s exactly what I got from the show. However, there is a lot more to say about this production what makes it so surprisingly great and memorable.\r\nIt is definitely notthe story which lifts Little Witch Academia so high above the average for me, because it is as simple as a story could possibly be: It basically depicts the journey of the lovely Atsuko \u201eAkko\u201c Katsuragi (more about her later on) while she follows her biggest dream which is to become a magnificent witch just like her childhood idol Shiny Chariot.\\n\r\nI know, this plot is very unlikely to win an award in originality since it takes up plenty of anime cliches (energetic protagonist, talented and arrogant rival, school environment), but nevertheless does it effectively establish the setting, the characters and their motivations in a simple and relatable way.\\n\r\nLater on in the show, the plot even develops a bit further and reveals some interesting new characters, relationships and mysteries, but I won\u2019t go any deeper into that.\\n\\n\r\nSo what is what makes Little Witch Academia so interesting? Perhaps the audio-visual site of the show?\\n\r\nWell, kind of, but not entirely. I mean, the animation quality is constantly high for sure and is most of the time in fluent motion and the character designs are adorable which makes the episodes very enjoyable to watch. However, the art style is not spectacular and absolutely stunning images are almost non-existent (which doesn\u2019t mean there are no optical highlights).\\n\r\nThe way more important thing regarding this aspect is the atmosphere that is conveyed, especially by the soundtrack which goes completely hand in hand with actions taking place. There is just this overall chilled vibe surrounding every dialogue and every piece of landscape which makes it so much fun when seeing the Akko and her friends interacting with each other.\\n\\n\r\nAnd \u201eAkko\u201c is definitely a key word in this previous sentence, because, honestly, I completely fell in love with this charming little witch and she is probably the biggest reason for me enjoying this show so much.\\n\r\nShe might seem like your mediocre anime protagonist at first and yes, that\u2019s what she may be, but every time she comes up with a new silly plan, I can\u2019t help but smile and I am immediately compelled with her actions.\\n\r\nAkko\u2019s innocence, honesty, temper and unbroken will to achieve her dream make her so charismatic and likable that every viewer should be able to enjoy her (often hilarious) adventures which always get her a bit closer to her beloved idol.  \\n\\n\r\nSo what is my verdict? And who do I think should watch Little Witch Academia?\\n\r\nWell, the second question is not so easy to answer since it highly depends on your expectations before starting the show. You won\u2019t experience a complex story full of countless story twists or phenomenal character developments.\\n\r\nBut if you are search for an extremely entertaining show with a light-hearted atmosphere in a cute setting, funny dialogues, endearing characters and a certain breathe of magic, Little Witch Academia is absolutely worth a look.\\n\r\nPersonally, I had a lot of fun with Akko\u2019s adventure and didn\u2019t regret a single time commencing the show.\\n",

The TV series expanded upon the OVAs with a full two season TV narrative presentation, allowing characters like sometimes rival/ sometimes friend Diana Cavendish or the brash Amanda and their respective cliques to receive more development as friends of series leads Ako, Lotte, and Sucy. A well made anime with a happy and wholesome message, it wasactually a lot happier story of young magicians than the darker Pottermore films and I found my assumption of it being cliche to be mistaken.",

I had not watched a single \"Why you should watch Little witch academia\" or any reviews on youtube, but I still decided to watch it because I had not heard anything bad about it either.\r\nAnd I am really glad I gave it a shot, because when the first episode started rolling, I knew that this was going to be something good. The art was amazing and the animation was fluid. It somehow reminded me of Harry Potter when I first saw it.It was a feeling of nostalgia and childlike innocense. The animaton also kept on astoundingly surprise, the magic is animated so well that it is almost breathtaking. So, the animation is really good and so is the art (The art is also a little different from \"normal\" anime and I think that is really refreshing to see.).\\n\\n\r\nThe story is not the most fleshed out one, but it keeps going and the characters keep going with it. In the first few episodes that almost feel like filler, I was a little nervous -but I knew I was going to finish this series, I believed in this series to be good. The characters are very likable and it is not a show that is entirely comedy, but it is neither entirely serious. It has a tone that kind of shifts, sometimes it is pretty serious and sometimes it is all fun and games, but it does not take away anything from the fluidity of this series.\\n\\n\r\nYou might think me prasing this series is just the work of some fanboy, but I believe that this series is something that really made me feel something. I remembered why I started watching anime in the first place, because of the astonishing visuals, the good story, the engaging plot (the plot in this series is not really the main focus of the series though, it is more like glue that keeps the series together, but it is enjoyable nonetheless), the likable characters. Everything in this series truly opened up my heart and to be honest, I actually cried a little towards the end... \\n\\n\r\nI rated this show 10/10 because of how good this series made me feel, it is one of those series that will stick with you for the rest of your life -if you only let it. I am not an experienced anime reviewer (This is my first review ever) and I can not say I am a truly experienced anime viewer. But I decided to review this series because of how good it is and because, \"Never forget, a believing heart is your magic.\"",

            "content": "Little Witch Academia is a great anime. Even though it's targeted to younger audiences, I still enjoyed it at 19. It was excellent in most ways, but there were some things lacking. I didn't enjoy the story too much simply because everything was so predictable. The \"twist\" near the end was pretty predictable (no spoilers) and a lot of the cliches were extremely overused, and the first half of the series was just an anime port of Harry Potter. Other than that everything else was very good. Character design and backstory was pretty good especially on the main character Akko, but voice acting in theEnglish dub was lacking in my opinion. The character's voices fit their part, but they really were sort of cringey in my opinion. The original Japanese cast in my opinion was much better and more experienced. Two of the main characters in the English dub (Sucy and Ursula) were relatively new to the voice acting scene. Some might say \"oh but you can be good with little experience\", which is true in some cases. Sucy's voice fit her well, but that's because she was a very boring and sort of depressed character. Ursula on the other hand felt lazily done in the voice acting section even though she was a very bright and cheerful character. Overall everything was great in my opinion and I enjoyed it very much. Even though I could nitpick at some things I still find Little Witch Academia very well done and I do hope for a second season.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. Although they are contained after a second warning below.\r\nI am a huge fan of Studio Trigger as anyone who knows me can attest, although a recent fan to be sure. After watching Kill la Kill I heard about the LWA OVAs and immediately loved them both. \r\nHowever after following the Little Witch Academia TV series every week for six months, it's extremely difficult for me to satisfactorily summarize exactly how I feel about it. It's a very different kind of series than the first OVA, and is mostly closer both in animation and in structure to The Enchanted Parade. On theone hand, in concept and at multiple points I feel Trigger deserves extremely high praise. But on the other hand, after completing the series, a lot of of problems which I ignored while watching becaming prominent in my mind, and sometimes when I think about the series these issues dampen my enthusiasm for the series as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nI will briefly summarize what I think of each of the typical MAL review criteria before going more in depth into what I feel are the greatest strengths and the greatest weaknesses - with some **SPOILERS**, because it is impossible to discuss particularly the latter without them, albeit I will try to avoid major spoilers as much as possible.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The basic story on its own is extremely enjoyable. Akko's struggle to become a great witch is heartwarming and refreshing in the sense that it is wholesome without becoming cloying and you *really* want to see Akko succeed. However, as I will discuss later, the pacing issues as well as some story developments that begin around the middle of the series and reach their head in the last 5 episodes or so greatly undermine what could have been a story as incredible as anything Trigger has ever done.\\n\\n\r\nArt: In terms of art style, the series is gorgeous. The backgrounds are detailed and soft in ways that are reminiscent of early Miyazaki, and the design of the locations are wonderful to behold. While the animation is clearly not as fluid most of the time as in the first OVA or even the second, at certain points, especially at the end, it rivals anything that Trigger has done. My only complaint is that some side characters' designs, particularly the characters new to the TV series, are somewhat bland and could be a lot more visually unique.\\n\\n\r\nSound: In technical terms this is probably the series' weakest point. The OPs and EDs are all great, but those are undoubtedly the high points musically. Try to do a drinking game out of how many times you hear the series' main musical motif - you'll be blacked out by the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is the aspect of the show which I think is the hardest to score. Akko is a wonderful protagonist. I never found her annoying like she feels at times in the Enchanted Parade OVA, and in fact she and Megumi Han's performance are often what raises the quality of the episodes, as there is so much life and energy put into her character. Ursula is also very endearing as a character, even if, as I'll explain later, at the end you realize that her character is deeply flawed both in characterization and in execution.\\n\\n\r\nLotte and Sucy as always are a joy to behold - this is why in my opinion the first half of the series is in many ways stronger than the second. They are strong presences in their own right and provide a lot of depth to the first half of the series which then drops off almost ENTIRELY for the second half. Speaking of, I know Amanda, Constanze, and even Jasminka are fan-favorite characters, but they pretty much replace Sucy and Lotte in the second half of the series. Even then Amanda and Constanze get individual episodes and then don't have that much impact on the story of the second half, which is focused almost entirely on Akko.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there are the three characters which I have the most to say about critically - Andrew, Diana, and Croix. I'll save this for the end, but suffice it to say that I think Trigger and especially Yoshinari were extremely misguided in the way they used these characters, and considering how important they are at various points in the series, it's a major strike against the series as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is also hard to score because while watching it, aside from a couple of episodes, I was immensely entertained. However it could be argued that if anything there is way, *way* too much focus on immediate entertainment within each episode at the expense of the cohesion of the series as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I fluctuate between a 7 when I'm ungenerous and 8 when I am generous toward this series, and at this point I will summarize what I think is the series' greatest missteps, but...\\n\\n\r\n**BEWARE: SPOILERS BELOW**\\n\\n\r\nIt is abundantly clear that Yoh Yoshinari should, like George Lucas in many ways, stick to grander ideas and character designs rather than directing the finer points of storytelling and character development. If there is one thing that threatens to sabotage the series as a whole, it is this.\\n\\n\r\nTrigger clearly was going for a Western-style animated series which balances SOL elements and struggles with an overarching story. Fantastic - this should be greatly commended, considering how this concept apparently is foreign to many anime fans yet holds a lot of potential. In fact I think the SOL episodes and the story-based episodes on their own are almost equal in quality, rather than either feeling like filler. However, the way this kind of series is usually structured in Western animation is by interweaving SOL and side character-based episodes with plot-related ones. Instead, Trigger mostly decided to put all of the SOL episodes in the first half, and then all of the main story in the second. This creates an extremely lopsided series that almost feels like two separate seasons or even two different shows rather than one. And considering the issues with the plot structure and character development which I will discuss, the problems with this approach are exacerbated if anything.\\n\\n\r\nThe problems with the plot structure and character development are the most clear with the way the three characters of Andrew, Diana, and Croix are handled.\\n\\n\r\nCroix is not even introduced until halfway through the series, and from *literally* the very first episode we are shown that she is evil, as well as the somewhat heavy-handed theme of \"technology vs. tradition.\" However, by the end of the series we are only somewhat more clear on why she became this way, and it seems to boil down to \"I wanted to become the witch that saved magic but didn't get chosen.\" It seems strange that Croix essentially became evil for this reason, yet her motivations seem to be misguided at best. If her development didn't get left until the very end of the series, maybe she could have been fleshed out more.\\n\\n\r\nUrsula/Chariot herself also suffers from a similar issue - despite her being a major part of the series, until episode *22* we have no idea about why she quit her performances as Shiny Chariot, and the way the show handles this character revelation is MASSIVELY bungled. The rug is pulled out from under the audience which has seen Ursula and Akko's relationship as entirely wholesome not only for the previous twenty-one episodes, but both OVAs as well, yet we get not even a FULL EPISODE to examine this enormous character development. An even bigger problem with this is that Chariot's error essentially boiled down to \"I trusted Croix too much\" - at one point they hint that maybe Ursula didn't care about the consequences of her magic, but it's a plot point that's immediately dropped. And by the way, try to rewatch any training scenes with Akko and Ursula and not cringe constantly at how painful it is. In hindsight so much of what Ursula does to try to help Akko feels almost condescending and mocking, and again, because this plot point is dragged out so long, it taints most of the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, if there are two characters who are arguably more bungled than Croix and Chariot, it's Diana and Andrew.\\n\\n\r\nAndrew is the one major side character introduced solely for the TV series, yet by the end I am entirely unclear what in the hell Yoshinari and Trigger were trying to do with him. An apologist might argue that he's meant to embody the non-magical world which has rejected magic, but there's two problems with that. One, the issue of Croix exploiting the emotions of the non-magical public as well as the climax of the show already handle this topic without needing Andrew. Secondly, it is abundantly clear that that is *not* all Trigger were planning on doing with him, until, again, episode 20 or so, where they shift hard AWAY from involving him in the main plot in any serious manner. We don't even get a final scene to cap off his development or have him discuss his and Akko's mutual character-building. Because due to the changes in the story, there's no time.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I'm going to touch the third rail of the Little Witch Academia fandom, because it is an issue which leaks into the canon of the series and embodies some of the biggest weakeness of the TV series...\\n\\n\r\nSHIPPING.\\n\\n\r\nAndrew is quite clearly introduced, if not as a love interest for Akko, then as someone to whom she is able to elaborate who she is as a character. He acts as a perfect foil for her, and their relationship in my view has as lot of compelling inversions to the typical action-adventure hetero relationship. They have actual chemistry, and in the first half of the series, it seems like Andrew shows a lot of promise as a character and his relationship with Akko, whether romantic or not, had a lot of potential, which is clearly recognized by Trigger early on. \\n\\n\r\nWho is the only character in episode six who is there when Akko has one of her best character scenes, where she opens her heart about her hopes and fears in trying to be like Shiny Chariot? ANDREW. Who is there in episode 10 when again, we see Akko provide the supposed main theme of the series, that magic itself is worthwhile because it revitalizes the world and provides joy? ANDREW. And even in the second half of the series, we see repeatedly that Andrew and Akko have an extremely engaging chemistry and character interplay, and Akko as a character is at her strongest when she's able to tell Andrew exactly why she wants to keep looking for the Words.\\n\\n\r\n... So where in the hell does he go at the end? I'll tell you the answer, based on interviews with Yoshinari. For some baffling reason, which if I were uncharitable I would attribute to spite, Trigger decided about halfway through the series (I would venture after episode 10) that they didn't want Andrew involved in the main plot anymore. Instead, they decided they wanted *Diana*, both as a major plot element, and as a pseudo love interest for the yuri fans to cheer for. \\n\\n\r\nI will say this. I do not like Diana. At all. She at no point becomes interesting to me as a character, or endearing. She has the chemistry of a rock with Akko, and I can probably count on one hand the number of times she shows any kind of emotion, positive or negative. It's actually interesting because the basis of her relationship with Akko, at least at first, is similar to Andrew's. But whereas Andrew from the beginning shows at least some kind of interest, if not amusement, towards Akko, and is able to engage with Akko, Diana does no such thing. Her character interactions with Akko for 90% of the series boil down to the typical \"tsun\" relationship. Boy, that's sure original. There are a couple of amusing moments where Akko almost gets an emotional rise out of Diana, but it never actually happens. Akko just at some point decides she admires Diana enough that she wants to get involved in her side plot.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, speaking of Andrew, when he is introduced and it's mentioned that Andrew and Diana have known each other since childhood, and considering Andrew and his father are somewhat tied into Diana's \"side plot,\" I think there is a grand total of ONE conversation between Diana and Andrew as well in the whole series. His contribution to her story is the equivalent of a backstory dump.\\n\\n\r\nBut in any case, Diana as a character starts as the stereotype of a school snob and teacher's pet, and at the very least through the first half of the series, is basically a Mary Sue. I know that term is frowned upon, but she is the definition of it. The absolute worst of this is episode five, where she literally comes OUT OF NOWHERE, reveals that unlike any of her own teachers she has taught herself Draconic language and contract law, apparently, and resolves the main conflict of the episode immediately. This is basically how she is involved in the first 13 or so episodes as well - she just shows up to either be condescending to Akko (only to be shown up by Akko in some regard) or just show off how much smarter than everyone else she is.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, she more or less disappears from the main action of the plot until THE LAST FIVE EPISODES, where suddenly we are given a *two-part story* about Diana, and now she is arguably the second most important character. This would be fine to some degree if it were used to make Diana interesting or compelling as a character, but no, it's just to show how special and hard-working Diana is, which is indirectly a huge slap in the face to Akko as well, since despite working for probably close to a year on her magic, she at best can transform herself into a few animals. It feels as if Yoshinari just decided that because he liked Diana for whatever reason, she needed to be inserted into the main plot, but without having a good story or character reason.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then in the final two episodes we are essentially given a heaping spoonful of yuribait, despite Akko and Diana STILL having less than zero chemistry. Diana almost even upstages Akko *at the finale*, and it takes away from Akko's big moment to shine. It left a really bad taste in my mouth, particularly after hearing the crowing from certain elements of the fandom that their yuri ship was now \"canon\" - not that it technically is, as much as Yoshinari and apparently Megumi Han according to other interviews clearly want it to be.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo bottom line, regardless of opinions on various shipping pairs or what have you, these issues of character development and pacing could have been resolved if they were planned out before the series aired. Instead it feels like Yoshinari and Trigger were changing things as they went along, and it threatens to completely derail the series. And it's a crying shame because this series could have been Trigger's absolute best - yes, perhaps even better than Kill la Kill. Instead we have an extremely enjoyable but deeply flawed series which at points feels more like Kiznaiver than the Little Witch Academia OVAs or any other work Trigger has done.",

            "content": "First amateur review: im avoiding making spoilers as much as i can.\r\nAt first we had those OVAs. now we have a series that started without much impact. but each week of a new release. i didn't realize how enchanting this anime is! at first i was having thoughts like. \"yeah its pretty decent. 2017 is starting off good\". after watching more episodes. I CANT STOP THE ADVENTURE. \r\nLittle Witch Academia gives a smooth ride from start to finish. with a little twist on the end. it takes you back and change all that you knew. leaving you thinking about the past. even then they gavea blossoming ending that left me a smile.\\n\\n\r\nStory(8/10): Started to go into the school yada yada. pacing will be a bit slow for others who wants a linear and always moving story. here we have lots of side stories. the everyday life of our hero akko. and her adventures with her friends.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9/10): Its art is good. well animated. and is definitely above average from the usual. most movements looked fluid and the colors and character design are well above average.\\n\\n\r\nSound(9/10): just good. everything fits well. the atmosphere is handled well by the BG sound. each orchestra pieces are flexible enough and is used accordingly when needed. from the energy lifting piece shifts to a more of an action and thrilling piece.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(9/10): Now this is one of the highlights of the show. the certain chemistry of characters hanging out together and by being with each other. but the friendship of the trio is what i loved the most. Characters had good development. and development is majorly caused by our main Akko. and how she drives everyone and me to have a \"believe it\" moments at most times.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10/10): I've enjoyed it. from when we started and when we finished. it felt watching everyone grow and learn from each other. by being together and staying strong when all hope is lost. we must never forget. a believing heart is your magic.",

            "content": "Little Witch Academia is the \"Savior of Anime\", for the Winter 2017 season that is. What we got that season was a decent yet half-hearted attempt to re-tell WWII in an alternate setting with the influence of magic (see Youjo Senki) and a figure skating anime riddled with too many flaws to count (still won Crunchyroll Anime of the Year award) *cough*cough* The show overall was a spectacle to witness in its own way. I mean that the show had its own charm that came off well (utsukushii and kawaii characters and their relationships, and the picturesque setting, magic boarding school Luna Nova). Granted StudioTrigger did test the waters in the first 9 episodes or so to gauge the direction they might take the show and the viewer reception to said storyline experimenting. Some of the episodes in the first nine came off way too shounen-like, almost in the unbearable Pok\u00e9mon shounen fashion; the episode where Akko was strolling around Sucy's dream world to help \"free her mind\" (i.e. wake up) was especially jarring. Starting from episode 10, I could definitely see Trigger getting its act together as they started making great use of their cast, giving them depth, and building up each episode to make a cohesive story. The ending was solid and borderline amazing for a shounen in Winter 2017. So, of all the Winter 2017 anime, this one is etched in my mind as THAT anime I recommend should someone ask, \"Anything good from Winter 2017?\"",

It started with Akko who dreams of becoming a magical witch who is able to bring smile to everyone's faces, like her idol - Shiny Chariot. However, upon reaching Luna Nova, she finds out that trying to become a witch is very hard. She can't even fly. \r\nAnd we all thought that was it. And then it got deeper and deeper and it got more enjoyable. The journeytook us into Akko trying to make the world a better place, doing the unexpectable, though she is only equipped with her believing heart. She does not have the ability, nor the magic talent, but she pushed her way through. You would be tricked into thinking \"wow she has a slow character progression\", but there is actually something behind it which I really loved. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation was outstanding. You could really feel the action scenes from behind the screen. They were able to make it incredibly magical, true to its purpose of making the viewers a part of the journey. Everything will make you wish you would have lived in that kind of world.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are lovable no matter who they are. The friendships built, the progression from the very start, is really good. Even the villain is very much understandable.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime all throughout. It was really great, and it gave off some CCS feels which I long for nowadays. We lack animes like this. Beautiful start, and a beautiful ending. Just, beautiful. This is really worth the watch. The kid in me awakened, and hoped that I never grew old.",

            "content": "A fun anime that could go well with younger audiences but successfully brings warm feelings of hope and wonder to even older viewers like myself.  I've never actually written a review for an anime before, but I felt compelled to write a review of this amazing and unique series and encourage others to watch Little Witch Academia (LWA).\r\nLet's start with the individual aspects:\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nThe overall plot of the story is rather simplistic, especially in the beginning - a young witch who struggles to realize her dream of being like her idol, and who despite her weaknesses somehow manages to shine and do thingsthat others couldn't.  Indeed the producers don't make much of an effort to hide their foreshadowing and many parts of the story are quite predictable, but the story writers manage to make each episode an exciting, fun, and adventurous story on their own.  True, each episode doesn't pack as much plot as a single OVA (after all, an OVA is relatively short compared to a 25 episode series) but this enabled the story to progress at a comfortable pace and to develop the characters and the plot in a more nuanced fashion.  For the uncanny way LWA manages to turn a simple plot into something exciting, while interweaving themes about pursuing one's dream, friendship, and change, I give this series a 9.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nFull disclaimer - I'm in love with Studio Trigger's artwork.  Kill La Kill was the first work I had seen by this studio and above anything, it was the artwork that had captivated me.  LWA continues to uphold the high standard set by Trigger's previous works.  Their ability to capture action through different contrasts, to capture a variety of nuanced facial expressions (and combine it with superb voice acting) is simply mesmerizing.  The artwork does an excellent job of setting the mood and air for the story, with dark scenes that evoke feelings of mystery punctuated with the green sparkles of magic that evoke awe and wonder. I could go on with examples from the series, but it'll probably be best to see the series for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nThe openings/endings were pretty awesome, though not particularly noteworthy, in my opinion.  I really liked the first and second openings.  The first seemed to evoke feelings of hope, childish naivete, and magical wonder, while the second seemed more serious, and mature (but maybe it's just me).  For it being good but not outstanding, I give the sound an 8.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters in LWA were amazing.  Trigger does an excellent job of giving each main character a very distinct personality, even right from the first episode.  This is accomplished through excellent artwork that captures the personality of each character through their character design, color pallet, facial expressions, right down to their movements, and the superb voice acting.  Character development was especially amazing - I don't want to give any spoilers, but one particular character's development is particular striking - she is given far more development in the TV series and becomes a completely different character than we would have ever expected from the original OVAs.  That's all I'll say.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nIt comes as no surprise that I absolutely enjoyed (and adore) LWA.  The execution of the ideas is simply amazing, and every episode is its own adventure and packed with hilarious jokes, references, and humor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\r\nIt's rare that something like LWA, a simple story involving young schoolgirl witches (who sorta save the world, but not really) could turn into something so amazing and enjoyable.  The art and acting work together so well to give amazing characters and a fun, exciting plot.  I definitely recommend people to watch LWA, and even if the beginning seems a bit slow at first, realize that it's all setup for more interesting developments that happen later on.  Proof that even a more lighthearted story about young characters in school can be a true masterpiece.",

            "content": "Despite some negative comments some people have wrote about this series, I'd like to critique it with praise.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThis anime's story starts off kind of slow. It starts off with a young girl, Akko with big dreams and very (and by \"very\", I mean abysmally) low levels of talent for accomplishing her dream - which is to become a prominent witch that can bring big smiles to those watching her perform her magic. Now, this set up would have very little substance if not for the world building that happens around her dreams and perceptions of the magic world of witches. Namely, I'm referring tothe fact that most actual witches regard the idea of using magic to entertain others as low class and not worth while. Despite starting off with cringe-worthy levels of ability and general lack of popularity, however, Akko, becomes a heroine that shines and wins the hearts of both in-story characters and audience viewers alike; her journey in this tale warms hearts, and her determination gets others to cheer her on. In addition, even though the first half of the series didn't really seem to have much of a villain, the plot ties itself together from beginning to end and by the end, you realize all those more-or-less casual events that seemingly didn't connect with the villain's build up actually matter and lead to her success at the end.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nIf I had to say whether this is an anime that is plot-driven, character-driven, art-driven or music-driven, I'd say this is a character-driven work. Akko, the main character grows tremendously by the end and it's her journey that make this show great. However, just like she couldn't have accomplished what she did at the end alone, this show would not have been so great if it was just her development. Everybody besides Akko, from Lotte and Sucy, Diana and Andrew, her teachers Ursula and Croix, and even minor characters like Amanda and Constanze, all get an episode or two dedicated to their development at some point in the story. Heck, even Diana's Cinderella-esque aunt and cousins exhibit some change or growth. As a result, the characters, even if minor, feel very real and dynamic. The world of Little Witch Academia comes to life because of this.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nOkay, let's be real. This isn't a stunning backgrounds with vivid and detailed character models show. But that in no way makes it bad. The artstyle, in fact, help to exaggerate the facial expressions and really bring out the character's reactions. It's also suitable for the overall not-so-emo-and-pretentious mood of the anime. Some shows like Fate/Zero may deserve more serious styles of animation but with this one, the kind-of goofy artstyle and almost disney-esque expressions just fit very well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nSadly, this is the weakest aspect of the show. It's mostly because there was nothing that really stood out on it's own. There are shows out there that are almost purely song-driven, like Macross Delta, but this isn't one of them. The opening and ending themes adequately reflect the tone and mood of the story, but in no way do more than that. That said, it's not bad either.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI started this off skeptical since the synopsis made me wonder if it was going to be like Harry Potter, which, if it were, it would have made me drop the show. It slowly became one of entries I looked forward to most every week as the show aired. There were moments where I just cracked up at Akko's antics. Other moments where I got interested in the backstory of other characters. In general, this show made me feel good every week. It also drives home a point that I can attest is important to every kid or teenager, or even an adult who is having a hard time in life - \"A believing heart is magic\". It's message is clear - believe in your abilities and potential and work towards it and it will be the \"magic\" that will make you succeed in life.\\n\\n\r\nWho's this show for?\\n\r\n-People who can enjoy a series with a positive message\\n\r\n-People who want a feel-good story\\n\r\n-People who like magical stories\\n\r\n-School genre fans\\n\\n\r\nWho's this not for?\\n\r\n-If you wanted emotional drama\\n\r\n-If you wanted something more...serious. \\n\r\n-If you were here for moe, tsundere, or some other cutesy anime trope. Sorry, this one kind of don't have your typical character tropes.",

Akko gets to meet new friends and struggles with her weaknesses of magic along the way. Part of it makes this anime worth watching.\r\nCHARACTERS: \r\nAkko: Determined, passionate, but also clumsy, reckless and down right weird. As I mentioned previously, she is the underdog (since magic is not her strongest forte -- ironically). But she never backs down from a challenge. She is also very caring to her friends.\r\nOVERALL: One of my topfavourite animes to watch! I absolutely recommend it to everyone! Believing is key and helps us to become stronger. Plus, there is plot and character development (which is refreshing... due to the fact that a lot of animes that I've been watching are lacking lately). Personally, I can relate to Akko and her struggles. Plus, get ready to see a lot of references. These are the factors that makes Little Witch Academia worth watching \u2665",

A romance does not define the story in which a female is the main protagonist but instead it is a story of friendship and comradery where people who didn't understand each other in the past come together and learn about each other and end up saving the day by believing in themselves and each other, Akko's ignorance towards who her senpai really is may be a little be cheesy but it's Akko Kagiri's innocence that adds to this stories melodramaticand melancholy dynamic that makes me feel like a kid again watching cartoons on a saturday morning without a responsibility in the world with impossible dreams manifesting in my head about how I want my future to end up. A story about a main character in a world of magic that isn't even able to ride a broom. It is a relatable story where the protagonist has a dream to become a great witch even though she is below proficient for her age on her abilities to control and utilize magic just like how some of us have dreams to be the best in a field even though we were below proficient for our age to ever hope to accomplish such a feat. Akko never gives up and with her group of friends they use the power of friendship to overcome all the odds and make not only their school a better place, but also the world they live in.",

I love watching her strive and work hard to be better at something, even when others say otherwise.\r\nSucy, Lotte, Diana, and the whole gang were awesome, and they made the series so vibrantand fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Little Witch Academia wasn't perfect, and some of the other episodes I thought seemed to focus on other characters than plot progression, but I truly enjoyed this series.

            "content": "This is easily Trigger's best work\r\nSince Gueren Lagann Trigger has been focusing on remaining extremely archetypal stories through their own lens. LWA is by far the best overall product from that philosophy.\r\nAs much as I love shows like KLK and GL both had story and progression issues, KLK didn't have great pacing, and really dragged on with it's main premise. That's not to say I dislike any of these shows. This coincides with other issues i have with both series'. However after watching LWA ep 1-24 in basically 1 shot, this is the best overall product that Trigger has produced.\r\nLike Previous trigger works, the storiesare very basic and archetypal but are re-imagined in an extraordinary matter. The evolution of animation itself may play a role in this bu LWA is by far the most intuitive and creatively made spin on such a typical and well known story. What brings this out in comparison to Trigger's other works is that the pacing is EXTRAORDINARY, every episode feels fresh and unique, even in an arc each episode is able to grab my attention easily and drag me along through the end. There is no down time in this show, and parts didn't slog nor went by too fast either it was just right. LWA may not have the super over symbolism injected into it like previous trigger works (however since the series is fresh taht would be an extremely premature statement to make) or not, only  time can tell.\\n\\n\r\nAnother great improvement is the ART. Trigger has not changed, they produce great quality animation and the show looks great. The improvement here is how creative it was. How LWA animators would splice in cool props and effects (all hand drawn btw) in just casual conversation or a hyped up scene. So many great shots done in the wackiest ways possible. Which made the show so enticing to watch. Trigger animators clearly love their craft so many references and nods to scifi felt like  seeing Daicon IV for the first time. Of course LWA is not daicon, but you can feel the same passion emanating from it with so many scenes.\\n\\n\r\nEvery character may not be Eureka Seven Tier, or Shakespearian, or the apex of writing. But every single character in LWA looks, and feels unique. The animators did a really good job making each character (even the extras) pop out. A very diverse cast that were very pleasing to watch. I won't talk about the mechanics of \"character development\" or \"Show, don't tell\" like a entitled loser. But all I can say is that I think ,you will derive enjoyment out of them, and appreciate them for their unique personalities and fun designs.\\n\\n\r\nSound is also great, Im not too big on OPs and EDs I usually skip them if they don't catch my attention easily. But some parts did have a very E7 feel to them, with that mix of adventure and adversity. It's not ground breaking but it suits the show very well. I don't think I would download it, but for the moment while watching it works wonders.\\n\\n\r\nThis was a very enjoyable experience for me. It greatly pleases me that studios like trigger still exist and producing this kind of content. And when my next pay comes, I hope to find a way to support it in the future. I cant really make use of the BDs but I hope to perhaps get the art book for this thats for sure. Trigger really outdid themselves here and I hope it pays off for them financially. Because quite frankly, this show is definitely worth your time, even if you are not into the content, it's quality surpasses it's thematic predispositions.",

Do you know what to expect from these types of anime and are tired of people pointing out the \"genre stereotypes\" and then judging the anime just on that? Just want to know if you should watch it? I've got you covered.\r\nSo Little Witch Academia is one of those special anime where you are already familiar with the genre, you know what to expect, and they hit every one of the marks you KNOW they are going to hit... except it tricks your brain into thinking you're watching it for the first time because it's put together so well and isso much fun. And then they surprise you with the feels.\\n\\n\r\nI don't quite know what it is about this show. But the animation looks and feels perfect, and the characters are just the right mix of hilarious and emotionally stirring, and the music hits just the right notes at just the right times when something just the right amount of epic is happening, with just the right amount of plot development in every episode. This all coalesces into an amazingly fun and moving anime that just about anyone can enjoy. Especially those who've enjoyed Harry Potter, kids and adults alike will eat this show up. It's got just the right amount of humor, feels, and adventure all surrounding a magical school core narrative. But it doesn't feel tired or annoying.\\n\\n\r\nI couldn't get enough of this show when it was originally airing. I always wanted the next episode. So much fun, and just hits all the right spots for me.\\n\\n\r\nHIGHLIGHTS: Just downright fun. Everything comes together to make a surprisingly good anime. A great example of the genre, fun for all ages. \"Anime Girl Harry Potter\".\\n\\n\r\nDISAPPOINTMENTS: No more seasons planned",

If you've seen those short films, you've got a pretty good idea what most of the episodes are like. The general plot is pretty generic and predictable, but with a lot of interesting little hooks and twists that did a great job to improve the story. Artistically it's absolutely gorgeous. I'm not a good judge of sound, but it was pretty solid. The characters are mostly pretty standard fare for anime, but like with the story, there's enough twists and character building that they become farmore interesting than I had initially expected. Plus for there's plenty of choices for \"best girl\" in the series for viewers that look for that sort of thing, though it is definitely NOT a series that relies on any sort of sex appeal. It's a very enjoyable series and I think that almost any fan of anime could walk away after watching it and have had a very positive experience.",

            "content": "First of all the series does not continue from the first two films, it retells them and expands, adding extra scenes between events already seen in the movies to build up the world and characters and hopefully go beyond the ending of Parade, the second movie. Considering the films had to condense a lot the series allows more freedom to explore and not rush us, the audience, through things. It builds up the relationships/friendships more, like seeing how Akko, Sucy and Lotte meet and how Akko got into the Academy and her background (ie: why she sucks at magic: she's not a born witch, unlikeall the others while the movies make seem like she just is a bit behind in development)\\n\\n\r\n*Character\\n\r\nAll the characters are still the same with Akko being our guide/eyes into the world of LWA. We actually see more development from each of the main girls including Diana, the rival. We see the build up of friendship outside of the school rather than \"this is a group of friends\" as introduced in the movies. Each girl still has her distinct personality and talents, which are explored more. Character development is always a good thing, especially relationships. Even the girls, Amanda and the other two, who first only appeared in the second movie (who apparently been around since the first but went unseen), are seen prominently in the series in the background as well as active roles, building up their relationship with the main trio unlike suddenly being introduced in the second movie.\\n\\n\r\n~Akko: A Japanese girl who saw the witch performer Shiny Chariot when she was younger and wishes to be a witch like her idol. However she comes from a non-witch lineage which puts her at a disadvantage since she doesn't know the fundamentals witches learn growing up and her magic potential sometimes comes out in spurts. She does not give up easily and is a bit of a chatter box who hates being looked down upon and is excited to learn magic, not studying.\\n\r\n~Sucy: A witch who hails from an implied Filipino background who is a lover of all things poisonous. She can come across as creepy and a bit obsessive when it comes to her noxious brews and research. At first she was off put by Akko's chattiness but since they're roommates she learns to tune her out or humor her or even use her as her test subject.\\n\r\n~Lotte: A young witch who's been attending the Academy longer than her two roommates. Rather patient, studious and well meaning, Lotte is supportive of her friends even if Akko can get into some trouble.\\n\r\n~Diana: An esteemed witch from a long line of witches who is the top student in knowledge and magic practice. She can be a bit of a refined show off, though not like the movie-version of herself who is a bit more snooty and direct rival to Akko through her dismissiveness. We see more dimension to her in the series. However she is willing to put her haughtiness aside for the good of all as she means well to be true to magic and its knowledge. She is poised and mostly gives facts bluntly without personal attack while her groupies do the sassing for her but Diana is honest and not excessive; when she realizes she was wrong about Akko and the Rod not being a fake, she tries to tell what happened but everyone believes that Diana the prodigy is the only one who could worked such great magic. There is obvious 'redemption' to her character in how she acts, as she is simply trying to do her best to make her family proud with the best of her abilities by going above and beyond, but the main cast think she's prideful, snooty and overly worshiped.\\n\\n\r\n*Story\\n\r\nThe story starts off with the beginning of the first movie and then moves to events that took place before Akko enrolled at the school or rather was TRYING to, to past the entry ceremony involving events seen in the movies as well as new ones due to some change in events. It starts off with Akko entering as a freshman for first term while Lotte has already been attending for a while, and Sucy enters the same time as Akko. As with the movies it shows for Akko to discover the power she has inside herself and to not stop believing and trying to do her best. Teamwork with her friends is also emphasized through the trials of life as a witch and a student between trying to master spells and encountering actual challenges and dangers. Humor and drama balances the flow of the episodes nicely. It also ties Akko's connection with Shiny Chariot much more, namely the Shiny Rod which in the movie was mysteriously at school despite Chariot's apparent disgrace as a true witch and being only an entertainer yet being the owner the powerful staff. It also establishes the fact the story takes place in our world, Akko being from Japan and Sucy implied being from the Philippines (her broom type and her last name). The tv series might reveal what happened to Chariot and where she is now, as she disappeared 10 years ago and Akko discovers her Rod in a forest. The main focus is Akko's adventures trying to learn magic and her mishaps and adventures at school and out of school, but also her goal to find Chariot and be a witch just like her.\\n\\n\r\n*Art\\n\r\nThe art style and quality is the same as the two movies. There is more showcasing of the world and magic that is in LWA. The creature designs are still memorable and fitting to the art style and the girls are still distinctive in their personal wear as well their school uniforms. The environments are rather enjoyable from the town, to leyline tower to forest to the school and more. Very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n*Enjoyment\\n\r\nThe tv series looks promising so far. The feel from the first two movies is not missed at all, it feels natural and well tied in with the expansion from events already seen in the movies. The new scenes are well done, including the diverting from the original film though it might get back to that point sometime via new connecting scenes (how the Rod ended up in the tower in the movie or is Akko going to hold onto it for the whole series, hence some change in events?) More development of characters, more exploration of the world, more Little Witch Academia's art, characters, and story for everyone! Watching the first episode alone is worth it if you've already seen the movies, but there are more adventures to be had!",

            "content": "As a fan of the original OVA and the Feature Film, I was psyched to finally get to watch the full 25 episode television series.\r\nI can say positively that it has a strong, emotionally satisfying finish that brought me to tears.\r\nHowever, I cannot give it a perfect score because the series has pacing issues early on and it takes awhile to hit its stride.  A lot of the first half is quite slog to get through, and I found myself missing the experience of the original OVA and movie quite a lot in the early episodes.  Also, while I love Akko's friend Sucyin the OVA and movie, in the TV series, while she is fleshed out more as a character, I had to admit that Sucy is kind of an asshole.  Whereas in the OVA she was merely dry, quirky and sarcastic, in the TV series she's got a sadistic edge to her that's not pretty and she warms to Akko only very slowly.  It took me awhile to warm up to Sucy myself.\\n\\n\r\nAkko's building of relationships with the other girls at Luna Nova beyond her roommates Lotte and Sucy make up a large part of the middle and final acts of the TV series and are very emotionally gratifying....especially her relationship with the at first icy and aloof Diana Cavendish and the decidedly anti-social Constanze.\\n\\n\r\nBut most rewarding of all is Akko's relationship with Professor Ursula who is her mentor and friend.  The series also gives us the answers to what happened to Shining Chariot the performing witch and why she ended her career; this mystery is merely hinted at in the OVA and movie but addressed squarely in the final acts here.\\n\\n\r\nThe series definitely picks up in the latter half and becomes a thrilling ride to the end and recaptures some of the original magic of the pilot OVA and subsequent Feature Film.",

            "content": "Spoiler Free, also I had this readied after the finale but only posted recently. \r\nHonestly what do I have to say about this show, It's an Original Video Animation (or OVA for short) that was made for a government art project, that was blown up due to its charm and appeal.\r\nNow the community always had, and still will have mixed opinions about OVA Sequel, and I personally felt that mentioned Sequel was definitely out of touch with the first OVA.\r\nHowever, for the TV Series, I would have to say my opinions turned into, an acquired taste. If there's one way I can describe the TVseries, is that, it's a passion project. Creative Minds brought together by shared, as well as varying, interests and ideas. You can say whatever you will with, wonky character building, inconsistent themes (ehem, Croix Chariot Star Wars fight) and very weird pacing, but I think this just proves how much the people who created it, from Director Yoshinari sensei, Animators, and Seiyuus, had so much fun into putting their time, effort and underpayed hours into something so massively inspiring, enjoyable and heartwarming.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the OVA didn't do that the show did Right is to bring these weird, mashed up inconsistent ideas ranging from jokes about Pie and Tarts to massive cool robots all the way to straight up nuclear warfare, and then tie them to the core idea of what made the first LWA so likable, and that is it's message of \"Believing in yourself\" and just overall optimistic views in life. The TV Series was able to deliver that sense of down to earth optimism despite the out of this world creations of the creators' imaginations, bringing you back to your childhood days, where you can think of absolutely anything, as long as it involved bad guys and heroes, and just dive into your imagination and never leave this perfect beautiful world you've created in your mind, where every time goes wrong, you can make it all right, as long as you believe.\\n\\n\r\nThis leads people to conclude that this Finale was Cheesy, Cliche and overall nonsensical, but this product of childlike wonder and imagination, is what makes you feel connected to these characters. These characters that you can honestly relate to, because once in your life, you were in a position, \\n\r\nlike theirs even if it was all in your head.\\n\\n\r\nBecause it doesn't matter if it was a cliche, believe in yourself and winner wins all, because you can look back to your days as a child and see how in your world, and in the world of Little Witch Academia, you CAN be the hero, and you CAN save the world, all you have to do is believe,\\n\\n\r\nBecause a Believing Heart, is YOUR magic.",

            "content": "\"Your belief in yourself is your magic!\" - Charlotte, not Kamina\r\nHaving started off as a training project for new animators, Little Witch Academia, the TV series, has blossomed into one of the best shows I've seen. Based on the title and poster, you might think it's a shoujo or some \"cute girls doing cute thing\" type of show, but that couldn't be further from the truth. The show is Trigger at its best, and captures everything people love about the studio. The familiar over-the-top action scenes, eccentric characters, and a plot that culminates to a dramatic finish are all elements we see in LWA. Thedifference is this time they've somehow managed to include all that without making it a strictly shounen show; it's difficult to put LWA into a specific genre. \\n\\n\r\nFor this type of show, that's a good thing. What we get is an extremely well-developed story with minimal tropes. Instead, each character has a chance to shine as their own personality, and the show never makes the mistake of focusing too much on one character and allowing the others to fall flat. Each character pleasantly progresses and grows from their experiences; they are surprisingly human-like and relatable despite still having anime-like, eccentric personalities. \\n\\n\r\nThe story has no fillers; each episode reveals something important about the characters or story. It is excellently paced, though I do think the ending is slightly rushed, but the episodes leading up to are well-timed and properly portrayed. Similar to other Trigger shows, the beginning of the show consists of minor conflicts with no clear obstacle for the main character to overcome. However, the later episodes require the main character to prevail over some monumental villain or task. \\n\\n\r\nLWA is an incredibly good show; its style and narrative remind me a lot of Gurren Lagann, as the quote in the beginning might have reminded you of as well. I have heard some people say this show doesn't interest them because it's just \"cute girls doing cute things,\" but that's a wildly inaccurate statement. Like TTGL, it's a coming of age story where self-confidence is the key to your success. Therefore, any shounen or TTGL or fantasy or really any kind of fan should definitely watch this. \\n",

            "content": "Quick warning, this review may contain major spoilers, so read at your own desecration.  \r\nLittle With Academia, has to be, by far, the best show Studio Trigger ever created.  It should be noted I\u2019m not a big fan of Studio Trigger and by proxy Studio Gainax, only a handful of their shows peeking my interest, such as When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace, Gurren Lagan, Panty & Stocking w/Garterbelt, and, to a much lesser extent, Neon Genesis Evangelion.  But Little Witch Academia impressed me on so many levels I don\u2019t even know where to begin.  Think if Harry Potter was an anime\u2026..andif all the main cast was female, not just one of them.  It stars Akko, an energetic middle school girl with aspirations of becoming a Witch.  When she enters Luna Nova, the magic school of the series, however, she finds it very difficult for several reasons; she\u2019s a stubborn girl who doesn\u2019t like to listen to others, almost everyone at the school hates her for most of the show and has no faith in her improving, and not to mention she really sucks at magic to the extent that she can\u2019t even fly a broom, the reason of witch she isn\u2019t aware of right away but is important to the plot.  The story is pretty by the numbers in terms of being a Harry Potter homage, there\u2019s really very little originality here, but all the cliche\u2019s it does use are executed so masterfully that you often forget that they even are cliche\u2019s.  although it\u2019s not flawless, it\u2019s prob ably my favorite anime of 2017 at least, and an anime that everybody needs to watch, or at least try; this is especially true for Studio Trigger and Studio Gainax fans, but even if you aren\u2019t, like me, it\u2019s still worth a look.  \\n\\n\r\nThe best part of the show is the characters.  Every one of them are interesting, complex, and likable.  Even Diana and her two friends, Hannah and Barbara.  At first the three seemed like very typical, cruel, one-dimensional antagonists whose only purpose for existing was to torment Akko as she struggles.  While Hannah and Barbara don\u2019t become incredibly complex, they do turn two-dimensional when Diana returns to her noble home and they show tremendous concern for her, even willingly chatting with Akko, informing her what\u2019s going on, which they never would\u2019ve done otherwise.  And then there\u2019s Diana.  While it\u2019s really easy to hate her during the first half of the s how, it\u2019s when she returns home to deal with her family\u2019s troubles that we learn more about her difficult lifestyle.  Akko assumes in her beginning that Diana was a prodigy of magic when she was young, but I truth she struggled just as much Akko.  It was even harder on Diana because of the pressures of living up to her noble lineage.  This naturally made her cold towards others, even after she obtained a mastery over magic.  She doesn\u2019t hate Akko on the personal level, nor did she have any desire of being cruel and malicious to her, she just hated watching her goofing off and seemingly not taking her training seriously, unaware of the real reason she wasn\u2019t able to use magic proficiently.  And she does eventually grow to think about Akko more positively eventually, the same as everyone else.  \\n\\n\r\nI love each character in the main four.  Akko herself can be annoying at times, but she\u2019s also likable and endearing.  She actually reminded me of Naruto in the early parts of that massive monster of a series; she\u2019s a wild troublemaker, but not with malicious intentions, she just wanted to improve her craft, and more importantly to get others to notice her, by any means necessary, although she\u2019s a lot less irritating than Naruto was back then.  Akko is just unbelievably endearing, almost everything she does either making me laugh, or at least smile, makes me tense, makes me cheer, especially later on in the show, or makes me emotional, and the conclusion of the show was very gratifying and made the journey Akko went through worthwhile.  Her friends, while not granted with as much development as her, are still fun in their own right.  There\u2019s Lotte Yanson, a Finnish Witch whose typically quiet and reserved, but can be angry if she\u2019s pushed too far, and Sucy Manbavaran, who also tends to be quiet, but has a rather dark sense of humor and loves to play tricks on Akko all in good fun.  The two aren\u2019t very complex, but they are two-dimensional at least, and serve as great supports for Akko.  Due to beding stuck with her they often get lumped in with her misdeeds, especially if she\u2019s late for something important, such as the Samhain Festival, but they end up growing a great bond with Akko that causes them to stick with her despite the criticism they get.  Their interactions was the most purely enjoyable part of watching this anime, it\u2019s not often that I watch a show with friends so close that it makes me envy them, and this one accomplished that.  \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s two more characters I want to discuss.  First, Ursula Callistis, aka Chariot du Nord, better known as Silver Chariot.  She was setup as Akko\u2019s inspiration, a great Witch who put on a show for Akko and many others when Akko was just six years old, and it moved Akko so much that she wanted to become a Witch just like her.  Once she finally arrives at Luna Nova ten years later, however, Chariot has disappeared, and most people who know the name have nothing but negative things to say about her, which just baffles Akko.  Little Witch Academia had a huge risk of turning her into a Mary Sue, a perfect role model for Akko and everyone else around her.  Instead, she is just as flawed as every other major character.  For most of the show she was disguising herself as the teacher Ursula Calistis; the truth is only revealed to us when the show is almost done, all the while we get bits and pieces of foreshadowing to allude to this twist.  Chariot was very similar to Akko as a child; she had a huge passion for magic and wanted to make people happy, but she lacked the skill to achieve her dreams, causing many blunders.  She did, thankfully, overcome this, just like Akko, and became the Witch Silver Chariot that many young Witches revered.  Her biggest flaw actually turned out to be her kindness and desire to make people smile ;one day when performing, everyone\u2019s expectations of her grew so great that she was crushed under the pressure to please them, shortly after abandoning the stage, taking on her identity as the teacher Ursula Calistis.  \\n\\n\r\nThe greatest twist involving her is that she was unknowingly the reason Akko was unable to use magic; when she stopped using her signature weapon, the Shiny Rod, magic power would be drained from her audiences whenever she put on a performance, which included Akko the day she saw one of those said performances.  The final character I wanna talk about is that of Croix Meridies, which is one of my only two major complaints about the show.  While she\u2019s not a terrible character in general,s he did come off as a rather weak villain.  She\u2019s interesting because, unlike the rest of the Witches in the show, she uses modern technology combined with magic, which is highly frowned upon by many Witches who value the old ways over the new ways.  She was old friends with chariot, who was pissed when she spirit inside the Arcturus Forest chose Chariot to wield the Shiny Rod instead of her.  Years later she came back to the school as a teacher, but her true intention was to awaken the Grand Triskellion, which was sealed inside of the Arcturus Forest, to bring a better, more peaceful future, loosing faith in the current generation of Witches being capable of that.  \\n\\n\r\nLike I said, she\u2019s not a terrible character, but for her story to work I feel it need a lot more buildup and back story.  I just felt like we got the bare bones of what was necessary to kind of understand who she is, but I felt it difficult to care about her personally, and I didn\u2019t really understand her plans at all.  Not to mention, despite almost nuking the world, she was seemingly let off the hook at the end and allowed to leave Luna Nova again, which seemed ridiculous to me; I\u2019m not saying the necessarily had to put her to death for what she did, but she would have still been punished in some way, but she wasn\u2019t.  that didn\u2019t come close to ruining the series for me, though, because all the other characters were so damn  great that having one sub-par character is pretty inconsequential.  I also found it disappointing that the whole \u201cmessage\u201d of the show happens to be \u201cTHE POWER OF LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP\u201d which is so common in anime today, it just felt like a really stupid conclusion to an otherwise fantastic anime.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are also incredible.  This anime has the best animation Studio Trigger has ever displayed; there isn\u2019t as much moving as in Kill la Kill, but it makes up for it by having much more fluidity and less choppiness, which is what I care about more than actual movement.  Every single solitary cell in this show is breathtakingly beautiful, it\u2019s an absolute joy to look at from start to finish.  The character designs are also nice, they have the anime style of large eyes, bright colors, and over exaggerated reactions, but still have a unique edge to them, too.  Overall, I loved this show, this is one of the most recent additions to my favorite anime of all time.  If Studio Trigger wanted to make a second season I would be all for it; hell, if they hosted another kickstarter to see if people wanted it, I would definitely support it, because it deserves more than just twenty five episodes than it got.  This is the first show I\u2019ve seen from director Yoh Yoshinari, but I\u2019ll definitely keep an eye out for him in the future.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE:  8/10",

            "content": "It's hard to talk about the Little Witch Academia series without talking about the original OVAs... but I'm going to try.\r\nLittle Witch Academia is an amazing creation -- not perfect, but impressive in almost every scale -- held back by a few glaring flaws.  I can recommend it pretty highly, but there are several caveats.\r\nThe story is probably the show's strongest suit... when it actually bothers to use it.  The series is paced very poorly, and I think I would regard it better overall if it had been a little tighter, or even if plot and character-building episodes had been better interwoven.Instead, we get a long, dragging first half that does build a lot of character but only introduces a few elements that are actually relevant for the story that the show ultimately tells.  The second half, on the other hand, is a whirlwind of character drama and events that does an amazing job of carrying the viewer on and, frankly, casts the weaknesses of the first half into sharp relief.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the story itself, it's actually kind of unique.  At the risk of very minor spoilers, Little Witch Academia takes place in a universe where magic is becoming marginalized, even dying.  That in itself is fairly unique (at least for the \"magical school\" genre) and when Akko, our main character, is a young woman in love with magic, who sees beauty in it and wants others to do the same, it serves to make her struggle seem all the more relevant and human when it isn't exactly a foregone conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, they're all very good.  There are at least nine or ten characters who get fairly full development over the running time of the show, and more who are in at least a couple episodes and you can regard, essentially, as 'people'.  The main adult characters (Professor Ursula and latecomer Professor Croix) are oddly the best studied and most well-rounded, which brings me to the flaw in the characters... Akko especially, and to a lesser extent her friends, can be hard to watch at times.  Akko's greatest trait, you see, is her zeal, which can get her into trouble as much as it gets her out of trouble, and that's fine, but it also gets her into quite a lot of awkward moments.  This isn't necessarily a bad decision, as it makes for a very distinct and flawed character, but it does lead to a few too many circumstances, especially in the first half, where I cringed at her behavior.  Similarly there were a few times where Sucy was just a little too mean-spirited for comfort and quite a lot before real character development kicked in where Diana's apparent perfection was really grating.  Ultimately, I found Diana to be the weakest character out of the expansive core cast; the episodes later on that covered her arc did a good job of explaining and humanizing her earlier appearances, but that doesn't exactly forgive the sour taste they left in my mouth.\\n\\n\r\nAs to the art and sound... they're good.  There's nothing truly jaw-dropping there; I watched in dub (a rarity for me) and the voice acting was very good, but that means I can't really speak to the original on that score.  The openings are both fairly fun even if they're not amazingly memorable, but the endings are forgettable, if pleasant.  The art design has a very good style that really does support showing off the magic and wonder of the world of Little Witch Academia, so in that way it's very good, even if there are times where the exaggerated expressions of characters go a little far from their main models.  That said, it doesn't really do anything that wows me.\\n\\n\r\nSo, that's the Little Witch Academia series on its own -- Highly recommended, but flawed.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\r\nArt - 9 \\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\\n\r\nBut let's say I did want to compare it to the OVAs.  How does it hold up?  Surprisingly, as someone who really liked the OVAs, I think the series might ever be better.  For all its faults, like the pacing, or Diana's earlier character, there's something that's beautiful, even magical, about the world as it exists fully realized in the show as opposed to the more thinly sketched universe of the OVAs.  Especially compared to the first OVA, with its monster-filled dungeon under the school, the Luna Nova and world around it we see in the show has better internal consistency without loosing too much of the sense of wonder that made the original so great.  Magical Parade is a closer comparison, as it introduced a lot of elements that were repeated in the show, but even then Magical Parade can't and doesn't go into the same careful depth that the show does.  So while they are different, and I can totally understand being of the opposite opinion, I think the series is actually my favorite version.",

The art is beautiful, the animation is nice and smooth, and the characters are adorable and relatable. The story is not too bad either! I actually quite enjoyed the story and found it inspiring. Many of us have someone we look up to, someone we idolize. This anime really showed how you can be your own person, and how you do not have to completely be like the person you idolize to be great.I believe young adults will really like this anime if not for the life lesson. \\n",

            "content": "Amazing? ABSOLUTELY YES!! I was so hyped for this series when I first saw the short films. I personally love the fantasy and magic genre, and I'm so glad this series turned out to be amazing, since a part of me was prepared for this to be a failure. I would love to give this a 10/10, but one thing has prevented me from doing so. Seeing the first 10 or so episodes, I was instantly hooked on this series. The anime made a turn from the fantasy school comedy genre to a more serious sci-fi adventure halfway through. Don't get me wrong, I lovedthe entire series, but I feel like that change of storytelling came too suddenly, which is why I can't consider this a true 10/10. But oh man! The ending was also just beautiful in every way possible, almost perfect in my opinion. What can I say? I love Atsuko's character. Is she cringy? Yes... Does she have any shame at all? Probably not... But nonetheless, her character was so lovable all the way through, even if she's a bit annoying at times lol. The soundtrack of this entire show really shows the ideal fantasy track. The tracks are epic when need be, and also incredibly radiant. And of course, you can't forget the \"a believing heart is our magic\" line. Call me childish if you want, but I love lines like those! And you can't ignore the stunning animation done by Trigger studios, who has done many visually stunning works in the past such as Kill la Kill and Kiznaiver. So should you watch it? Yes! If you've read this entire post and you're still not impressed, please still give it a watch anyways!",

But at the same time creates something unique with the characters and the story. \r\nOn to the negative of this show, the story it was good but no that excel of other past show from Trigger and the OVA where better overall because of the length. This show it is better in a movie format than series and it tells because some episodes feel like they where trying to stretch the story. I know this will not the same buti wish the ending was bit more flashy like Kill la Kill or Space Patrol Luluco.\\n\\n\r\nThe positive, the art was out the charts with a lot of animation and with beautiful colors scenes. The main characters are really lovable and they it develop much more then OVA. The opening and ending song are great the get you hype to watch the episodes and relaxing when you end one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall for me this is a cult hit anime than in time will gain it popularity, but i hope the make it into a movie series than a tv show.   \\n\\n",

            "content": "I tried. I really tried my hardest to go into this anime to watch it critically, and not get so sucked in to the world and the characters. I find that when I do this, my emotions get wrapped up in the lives of the characters, and I begin to fall in love with them in an instant.\r\nFor awhile, this worked. \r\n\"Little Witch Academia\" follows Atsuko Kagari, or Aukko for short, a bubbly young witch who hopes to become like her idol Shiny Chariot at Luna Nova Academy. Over the course of 25 episodes, you see the ins and outs of Aukko's time at LunaNova and how she truly grow progress despite how much she has going up against her. You also see the lives and trails other characters face around Aukko, and how they all grow to become better people.\\n\\n\r\nI started this anime with the mindset that it couldn't suck me in. The first episode, I was a bit annoyed with a few things but found it to be charming, the second episode was really good but I still didn't think much of it, and by episode six I was so invested in the show I couldn't stop thinking about where the rest of the series would go with it's premise. I watched the entire show in under a week, and I really wish I had taken my time with it. I honestly miss the show, and all of the characters that played a role in it.\\n\\n\r\n Also, this story is so visually interesting. The world of Luna Nova, the town the characters occasionally run through, it is all so pretty. Aukko has some of the best animation on her though, with all of her often absurd and hilarious reactions. The backgrounds are so lovely, I can't give enough praise to just how much I love the art design of this show. \\n\\n\r\nNow, for the characters...I will mostly talk about the ones that really stuck out to me, in order to keep this short. I did really enjoy all the other characters, though.\\n\\n\r\nAukko is an amazing lead character; built on a burning desire to live her dream, a very stubborn attitude, and she can often be incredibly childish...I couldn't help but cheer her on. Does Aukko always make the best decisions? No, but that is what makes her character interesting. I want to see Aukko succeed because she is repeatedly beat down through out the series. Often labeled as someone of not much worth to Luna Nova, Aukko's ambitious nature keeps her moving past a lot of the often cruelty of the other witches. I really like that.\\n\\n\r\nSucy towards the beginning of this anime was honestly what frustrated me the most; I found her to be annoying, rude, and really mean-spirited. Luckily, she does grow to like Aukko a lot towards the end of the series, and you can see that really shine in the lest few episodes. While I didn't consistently enjoy Sucy, I did think she could be quite funny at points. I just feel a lot of her more humorous points were often overshadowed by this really mean nature. \\n\\n\r\nAndrew is terrible, I really don't mind saying that. While I grew to appreciate him towards the end of the series, he felt like such a flawless, generic love interest that it did make me roll my eyes when he was onscreen. I didn't really buy his and Aukko's relationship, either. Honestly, I found Frank and Lotte's relationship to be much more cute than Andrew and Aukko's, but that is just my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nDiana Cavendish is the best character of the entire series, hands down. Diana, towards the first half o the series, seems more like the typical school bully at times, but as the series progresses you see she isn't really out to be mean to anyone in particular. Diana is just bored of the magic she has grown to know, and shoves so many of her emotions downward that it has left her rather cold. Aukko has what Diana needs, a passion for magic, and Diana has what Aukko needs, maturity and training. I love the relationship that forms between these two characters. It is something really astounding, and I loved to watch Diana slowly grow to respect Aukko's place at Luna Nova more and more. I love Diana, and I could sing praise for her constantly.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, I loved Little Witch Academia. Did I have a bit of problem with a few of the characters? Yes, but that wasn't an ongoing problem, and it fizzed out by the end of the series. Little Witch may be sappy and corny to some, with it's talk of dreams and believing in yourself, but it does it in such a heartwarming and sweet way that I recommend this anime to anyone and everyone who hasn't seen it. This isn't just your typical \"magical girl\" or \"witch\" anime, the show is lined with turns, and incredible world building and character development. \\n\\n\r\nGive it a try, I guarantee you won't be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\n\"Believe in yourself, and in your heart!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Can somebody who hasn\u2019t seen the OVAs formulate a valuable review about Little Witch Academia? Well, I\u2019ll take it one step further, I haven\u2019t even seen Harry Potter! Ha!\r\nStory:\r\nWe follow the (mis)adventures of a hyperactive girl named Akko as she tries to become a formidable witch like her big idol Shiny Chariot. That\u2019s easier said than done, as Akko is really bad at magic, and I mean BAD. The general buildup of the 25 episodes is not that different from what Kill La Kill did. At first, we get a lot of mundane, slice of lifey episodes and the plot merely being mentioned, but notfocused on. Around halfway through it starts taking over and the lightheartedness gets less (though it never completely vanishes). I like this kind of slow increase of seriousness, because I like to enjoy both, the relaxed and the tense sides of the work\u2019s world. For some, this change may not be what they wish for, I however enjoyed it. The story itself is not too extraordinary, it\u2019s the classic quest to achieve a goal, not unlike what many shounen series look like. I can\u2019t say that this anime is void of plot holes, but due to other outstanding factors, it never feels important whether everything is perfectly coherent or not, something Trigger seems to have mastered. Long story short, the plot is nothing special, but executed well.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIf you know the Trigger style, you know exactly what to expect. Though I have to say, while their other shows were using many over-realistic or hard-edged shots when going into the extreme, Little Witch Academia remains relatively calm and smooth in general. The producers said they wanted to make a family-friendly show and this also shows in the artwork. Of course this also means tons of bright colors, to a point where the anime gets a bit of a cartoony feel. The Western influence is highly visible in Little Witch Academia. As with KonoSuba, I dig this hybrid style and for a show like this, it feels very right. The special effects are spread throughout the series in moderation, but nonetheless look very beautiful. Prime examples are episodes 6 and the final one. Bonus points for the Merrie Melodies/Silly Symphonies/Fleischer style clips from episode 8.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nMegumi Han does a fantastic job as Akko. Her voice emits all the fun the character is made of, but she also works in more serious moments. All other main characters have fitting voices for their personalities, especially Sucy, who sounds like a wicked witch out of a kid\u2019s nightmare (isn\u2019t that a perfect description for her?). On a personal note, I always chuckle a little when I hear \u201cNaruto\u201d in a serious role. The opening and ending songs were all solid, the second opening is quite catchy and slowly starting to grow on me. This show also uses background music very efficiently. I mentioned before, that I get the feeling that orchestral soundtracks are used more often in recent anime and I think that is a wonderful development. Provided of course that this statement is true and not my weird subjective impression due to the anime I choose to watch. The Little Witch Academia soundtrack is similar to what you may hear in a movie, which may or may not be another nod to the West. Anyway, I think it fits very well and gives emotional scenes more impact.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis is one of the strongest parts of Little Witch Academia. There are so many fun characters for everybody\u2019s liking that I fail to see how anybody could not at least find one suiting their tastes. Akko is very similar to a shounen protagonist in many ways, but she is such an upbeat, positive girl, that I can\u2019t bring myself to dislike her, even though I\u2019m not a fan of those archetypes. If you don\u2019t like Akko, then how about Diana? At first it seems she is going to be the bitch rival, but she happens to be a very honest and humble person, who just happens to take things more seriously than Akko. We also have lots of fun side characters, like the complete maniac Sucy, the adorable sweetheart Lotte, the tomboyish Amanda, the grumpy genius Constanze and many more. Even characters like Hanna and Barbara, who are complete jerks, are likeable by being just too goofy to take seriously. In total, all characters were either well written or fun side characters. If I have to criticize something, it\u2019s the fact that Andrew had little involvement in the overall plot. I just wish he would have done something important along the way. As it is, his scenes are really pointless, as he is also too serious to be fun on his own. Just give him an unrequited crush on somebody or whatever. Another, though very minor, problem of such a colorful cast is that you can hardly flesh them out much. As I said, they are fun, but I want to know more about them too.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI have drawn some parallels to Kill La Kill and that for a simple reason. Not (only) because they are both Trigger shows, but because they work in the same manner. They are what I think I called \u201cbrainless fun\u201d in my KLK review, but that isn\u2019t a very endearing term. What I mean by that is that anime don\u2019t need to be deep or have constant gags to be entertaining, it also works to have a coherent story to tell and do so in a way that just screams \u201cfun\u201d. I repeat that word over and over, but that\u2019s because that is the one big message I get from Little Witch Academia. I am positive that most of you will have a good time watching this show, I sure as hell did.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n9.0/10",

            "content": "***This is a spoiler free review***\r\nWhen I first saw the original OVA episode of Little Witch Academia I almost had my fundamental understanding of the video medium turned upside down. How did Studio Trigger cram such a satisfying story into 40 minutes? How did they make it not seem like a rushed mess? \r\nI wanted to see more of this work and while the second OVA helped with this, it felt lacking. Now however we have a full double cour tv series that features the same lovable cast with interesting magical adventures. \r\nPlot: 7/10\r\nSort of a mixed bag here. The first season was almost entirelya sectioned off bit of short stories (like the first and second OVA). While key events in certain episodes show character development, there really is no overarching plot development. The first season is very much a sort of slice-of-life show with the magical elements. The second season however kicks it into full gear with a plot that stays relevant throughout the remainder of the series. These episodes in the second season are in my opinion where the show really shines. There are some awesome moments in the first season but for the most part since there is no sort of plot progression I view them less satisfying compared to the second season.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nVery, very good in my opinion. They were able to keep the visual style (art) intact from the OVAs which was a crucial thing to accomplish. The characters look great and in Trigger style the clothing looks amazing. Trigger always seems to nail a sort of modern yet world fitting fashion sense. In Kiznaiver I feel like they hit new strides in how good and fitting fashion can fit into an anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality was in my opinion also great. Yes this is a tv series so the amount of expressive animation is limited due to budgeting and time constraints but I feel like Trigger did a great job picking and choosing where to shine. The action shots look pretty amazing and even the more low key shots stand out due to...the Trigger style. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSimply perfect. The OST fits in so well with the magical setting of LWA. People say the series is just Harry Potter but with magic girls; they wouldn't be wrong but it is because of the music that it feels this way. I don't know exactly wait entails a magic feeling audio queue but LWA has it, everywhere. The voice actors are simply amazing. They bring out their characters perfectly. The on-screen animations help too but it's the VA's ability to really express their characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI feel like the character development in the show did wonders for the universe of LWA. There were so many questions left unanswered/up in the air after the OVAs. The tv series really expanded on the main characters while adding a few awesome new ones. The character interactions are the main stars here. Every since one of them feel full of emotion, excitement, and in some cases sorrow. Just everything about the characters is spot on. I just wish it carried through all the episodes instead of in certain early ones and all of the second half. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis was absolutely an amazing ride. The show had exactly what I wanted; more magical school adventures with the main cast that I fell in love with in the OVAs. The tv series took a little while to get fully started but once it did, I was falling in love with the world all over again. If you want magic school Harry Potter but in high school girl form, watch this tv series after watching at least the first LWA OVA episode. You will not regret it. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

            "content": "Growing up as a kid, I still fondly remember the times of watching old-school animated Disney movies. You know, the kinds of movies that featured a magical world that just drew you into the depths of it's fantastical story and by the end, left you with a feeling of utter amazement and confidence. For me, Little Witch Academia (LWA) brings back many of those youthful feelings of nostalgia. \r\n-Overview:\r\nThe story starts out with a young witch, Atsuko Kagari (Akko), who has a dream of becoming a great witch just like her idol, Shiny Chariot (a magical performer), whose performance inspired her to take up witchcraft.To pursue this goal, she enrolls into Luna Nova Academy, an ancient school that is renowned for training competent and amazing witches. Along the way, she meets many friends, rivals, and people who she looks to for guidance. However, her path towards becoming a great witch isn't one without hardships and adversity.\\n\\n\r\n-Story:\\n\\n\r\nThe story of LWA primarily revolves around Akko who, despite having zero talent for magic, strives to become a great witch just like her idol, Shiny Chariot. Due to her lack of magical talent and impulsiveness, she's often the laughing stock of her classmates, and experiences failures on a daily basis. However, despite that, she still tackles each obstacle head-on and never gives up on her dream. The old adage of \"hard work pays off\", is definitely a central theme in this anime. Of course, no man (or witch) is an island. In Akko's case, that's where her friends and mentor come in, to provide support, encourage, and inspire her in times when she's at her lowest. Throughout the story, Akko learns not only to believe in herself (but to believe in the Kamina tha- Sorry), but to also believe and put faith in those around her. After all, the prominent quote in this anime is \"A believing heart is your magic\".\\n\\n\r\nAs a side-note: The first half of the story is pretty much episodic in nature. It's essentially a slice of life series revolving around witches in a magic academy. It's really not until a little over half-way through that the plot really starts to take hold. While I personally enjoyed the early episodes, I've heard of a few who haven't, so I thought I'd mention it to any would-be readers. Although, I'd strongly suggest watching through the first half, since the story only gets better with time. \\n\\n\r\n-Characters:\\n\\n\r\nPretty much all of the main characters in this anime are very well done. Akko is your classic happy go lucky dunce of a girl who you can't help but love, Lotte is your shy and reserved bookworm who cares deeply for her friends, and Sucy who is a mischievous, slightly sadistic,  and smug girl who has an unnatural fondness for mushrooms and deadly poisons. Diana is Akko's rival and polar opposite. She comes from a distinguished family of witches and values tradition and elegance above all else. It's because of this that the two often get into confrontations with one another because of their opposing worldviews and personalities. However, despite being stern, Diana is actually a very compassionate and caring person that shares more in common with Akko than she lets on. Akko's primary mentor and guidance councilor comes in the form of Ursula, who's a teacher at Luna nova. She's a caring and thoughtful woman who tries to guide Akko down the right path and gives her much advice along the way. I think what I enjoyed most about the characters is the synergy that they shared with one another, specifically among Akko, Sucy, Lotte, and Diana. They don't just automatically becomes friends with each other as if it was preordained. It's not even to say that they're alike in any way, but after spending time together, they learn more about each other and come to a mutual understanding which makes their friendship actually seem significant. Also, while the characters may not be the most complex out there, but they each have enough depth to them which makes their characters interesting and unique. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the antagonist of the story, they're not your typical villain. Especially, once you know their motivations and goals, they're actually pretty understandable, which is something that I can appreciate. \\n\\n\r\n-Animation and Music:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is done by studio Trigger, who is widely known for their signature style of animation. Sometimes the animation is completely goofy and cartoonish, while other times it's serious and incredibly detailed and vibrant. It's good when it needs to be good (emotional moments, fight scenes, etc), and OK in less significant scenes. There's a few off models that I noticed here and there, but I can't really fault them for that (in fact, some are quite hilarious).\\n\\n\r\nThe music is frankly fantastic. Bright orchestral scores with violins, catchy and beautiful openings, nothing is necessarily overdone or overpowering, but fits in perfectly with the theme and tone of the series. \\n\\n\r\n-Overall:\\n\\n\r\nI honestly enjoyed every second of watching Little Witch Academia. Unlike many anime, it's an honest series that stays true to it's vision and never compromises it's integrity. It's a wholesome and fun show that you can watch with family, friends, and, well....just about anybody.\\n",

            "content": "Little Witch Academia review\r\nWith a new and captivating concept , with stunning visuals and vivid characters LWA is one of those shows that leave a good impression for its audience after watching it.\r\nWhen we were kids we all have something we wanted to do when we grow up, we all had  dreams and  the determination to work hard for our dreams. \r\nWell this is how our story in LWA starts with our main heroine Akko  who views  a magic show , captivated by it she falls in love with the magic and the one who performs it  Chariot. She thendecides to follow in her footsteps and go to  LWA to achieve her dream . \\n\\n\r\nIn a total new world and full of mysteries and magic Akko  experiences new emotions that she never felt ,meets new people and makes friends and rivals and under the guide of her mentor Ursula she learns more about magic . This experience helps her  to discover more about her own identity and what struggles she must overcome to achieve her dream.\\n\\n\r\nThe most impressive thing that this anime left are the characters raw  emotions  especially from our heroine Akko.  During her  journey to find the seven lost words from her magical staff Chariot , she learns the meaning behind those words experiencing different emotional states. With the help of the beautiful visuals those raw emotions  are well exposed to its audience captivating and creating an emotional atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nThe thematic exploration is very rich for its audience in LWA , themes as dreams, determination, hardworking, emotions, traditionalism vs modern times are questioned and executed with the help of our characters. Having a different range of themes is always good but what matters is how they are explored and brought forward to it\u2019s audience.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in LWA are  really  what makes this show worth watching. Akko the clumsy and straightfoward idiot who never gives up after she fails having a dream that keeps her going on.  She represents the hardworking type who has to start from zero with no talent at all which we all can relate from our real life. Diana who everyone from LWA depends on her knowledge in magic and asks her to solve different problems involving the academy. At first she is mistaken as an elite with a snob attitude but as we get to know more about her circumstances and story we all appreciate her sacrifices and responsibilities she faced since young age. \\n\\n\r\nLotte and Sucy despite their lack of characterization explored , from their interactions with Akko and other members from Lwa we get to know more about them. We find out about Sucy who is mad scientist who likes to experiment different poisons and mushrooms  , Lotte who is a book worm and has the ability to speak with fairies since young age.  A flaw for this anime is the lack of characterization for the minor characters who later will influence the plot and story and Akko\u2019s development.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked in this anime was the fact that they put in debate the theme about traditionalism vs modern times. It was done with the help of a new character introduced Croix who changes the whole believes and appearance in LWA with her new magic  development.  The anime critique the modern society who is too depended on the technology and presented the consequences without it ,  and presented a contrast between magic and science who can coexist together.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals play an important role for the main plot and story in LWA. With the help of them  the emotional state of characters and experiences are conveyed to its audience. \u201cEmotions are magic\u201d probably one of my favorites metaphors from LWA , were the visuals help and portray how the human emotions are conveyed into magic energy .\\n\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia is an anime that motivates and persuades its audience to follow his dreams , advises them to not choose the easy path and run away from struggles  but overcome them, to strive for a place , to open your heart and rely on your friends or dear persons in hardships times  and finally to follow your raw emotions and believe in your own strength.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I just finished watching the final episode and oh my goodness, what a beautiful, amazing journey it was, I am overwhelmed by so many different emotions and I feel like I am about to tear up. I still can't believe this anime is over as it seems like only yesterday the first episode came out and I couldn't wait for more of Akko's adventures and shenanigans. But it's over, and maybe we will get to see our little witches again. At least I hope so.\r\nStory: 10/10.\r\nWhen I was little, I was obsessed with a show called The Worst Witch (now I know it's based offa series of books, but back then the TV show was the only thing I knew of), and Little Witch Academia reminds me of said show as Akko, let's admit it, is the worst witch of the 21st century. Inspired by Shiny Chariot and her magical shows, Atsuko Kagari, also known as Akko for short, came to Luna Nova in hopes of becoming the greatest witch this world has ever seen. But it turns out that the magical society has never approved of Chariot and her stage performances, so our naive protagonist ends up facing several hardships, be it boring classes and her inability to cast even simple spells or the witches' opinion on Shiny Chariot and their disapproval.\\n\r\nWhile the idea is pretty simple (and the idea of schools of witchcraft and wizardry is not new, remember Harry Potter and The Worst Witch, for example), there is a certain charm in this story as it is truly magical and inspiring. Eventually, all details begin to make more and more sense, falling into their places for us to see the whole picture. Little Witch Academia is epic, beautiful and charming in a way that makes you feel like a kid again. Remember those times when you believed in magic and miracles or liked to pretend they existed? That's the kind of show that brings all these warm memories back and I thank it for that.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10.\\n\r\nI love TRIGGER's art style and animation. After seeing Kill la Kill, I kind of expected this show to be epic in terms of angles, action and motion and I was right. I noticed (and maybe I am just imagining things) that in the last episode the art style and the quality of animation became a bit more sloppy, which is why I cannot give the art 10 out of 10, but let's give this show some credit for beautiful character designs, visual effects, scenery and animation, alright?\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10.\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia has a great soundtrack. At times it's epic (just remember its main theme that is associated with Shiny Chariot and great adventures), at times it's beautiful (I still can't get over Professor Woodward's first appearance in the show). The voice actors did a great job as all voices fit characters perfectly. That's the reason why my rating for this aspect is 10 out of 10, the sound in this anime definitely deserves it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10.\\n\r\nLet's start with Akko, as she is the protagonist and one of the most interesting characters in this show. She is the worst witch of Little Witch Academia as she can hardly cast spells and, even when they do work, the result is far from what she or her teachers expect. She is naive, loud and noisy, as well as very stubborn. I did not always approve of her actions as sometimes they lacked common sense or any sort of wisdom. She acts first and then thinks about the consequences. But she never gives up. If she fails, she tries again and again and she is willing to learn because admitting defeat halfway through means giving up on her dream. Can't afford that. Which is why I like Akko. I like her because she is imperfect but, instead, our little witch is realistic. She makes mistakes yet she refuses to stop and that, ladies and gentlemen, is a very valuable lesson to learn, don't you think?\\n\r\nHer friends, Lotte and Sucy, sometimes act as the voice of reason because Akko doesn't have any real knowledge of how the magical world and society work, driven mostly by her dream and Shiny Chariot's show. Even though they do not get as much attention as I believe they should have, they are very charismatic and adorable in their own ways. And you know why? Because they have solid and well-established personalities. Lotte is a quiet, somewhat shy and kind-hearted girl and, in comparison to her sassy friend Sucy, she is more soft-spoken (can you believe that her seiyuu also voiced Rukia? now that's what I call talent). In the meantime, Sucy is cunning, sarcastic and even somewhat sadistic at times. All three girls are different yet their friendship grows stronger with each episode as the show goes on. And by the end of this show, you can't help but feel like you've known them for years, thinking of them as your friends.\\n\r\nAnother witch the show is focused on is Diana Cavendish, a talented and bright student, everyone loves her and thus, you might get the impression that she is a Mary Sue. She's not, though. She is a serious, calm and collected person who takes her responsibilities seriously. It is hard to talk about this character without spoiling the plot to people who are just planning to watch this anime, but, if you ask me, I've always believed that there was so much more to her. Needless to say, I wasn't mistaken. Akko sees her as a rival and at the beginning Diana is portrayed in a somewhat negative light, but you can't help but notice that you can't hate her. Furthermore, sometimes you cannot agree with Akko.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, Diana's teammates are less pleasant individuals and they can be pretty annoying at the beginning. But oh boy, I would like to thank the creators for taking time to develop these minor characters as well, that was truly amazing.\\n\r\nNow, let's talk about Shiny Chariot, currently known as Professor Ursula (it is not a spoiler as it's been confirmed in the original OVA), is one of the key figures of this story. A mysterious witch Akko admires while the rest of the magical society has little to no respect for her, believing that her magical shows were giving people the wrong idea of magic and witches. As Professor Ursula, she guides Akko like an older sister. She plays a very important role in Akko's life and all I can say without revealing too many details is, it's not just about her being a role model Akko wants to be like. Ursula a.k.a. Chariot has been one of my favorite characters ever since I saw the OVA and I was so happy to get to know her and her backstory better.\\n\r\nNo, I am not done yet. Not until I give some credit to Amanda O'Neil, her team, Andrew Hanbridge and his friend Frank. While they are just minor characters, TRIGGER bothered giving them all a chance to grow and contribute to the plot. Sometimes it is hard to say anything about minor characters, they exist, they may be okay, they may be annoying, but in this case, they are all likable and sometimes it's almost impossible not to think of them as the members of the main cast.\\n\r\nOverall, this show has plenty of interesting and likable characters that grow and develop as the story goes on. A cast I have zero complaints about is a rarity and I have to tell you, guys, I already miss these characters, even though the show just ended. It reminds me of how I refused to say good bye to Kill la Kill. Thank you, TRIGGER, once again.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10.\\n\r\nLittle Witch Academia is beautiful. It was funny, it could be sad and it was, without a doubt, epic. 25 episodes were not even remotely enough and I am hoping for a new season (I've heard on the grapevine that the creators want to make a show that'll be focused on Chariot, but rumors are just rumors and that remains to be seen).\\n\\n\r\nI am going to miss Little Witch Academia. After seeing the OVA, I wanted it to get a show of its own. And now this show is over. It was a great adventure. Good bye, little witches, let's meet again someday, I will be waiting.",

            "content": "Little Witch Academia was an amazing intersection between magic and anime. I almost never write reviews, but this certainly warranted one. This reminded me of the reason that I love Harry Potter so much: through the characters and the world that is created it has the power to capture the imagination in a pretty surreal way. The characters were really well-developed, the music is great (especially OP2 - MIND CONDUCTOR by YURiKA) and the story itself was always funny and suspenseful. The art itself might seem a bit childish at first but trust me its perfect for what it is trying to convey. There aremultiple characters in this anime that grow up and realize how naive they were which hits home with me and many others.\\n\\n\r\nI can't remember the last time I was grinning while watching an entire anime. It just has the ability to make you feel all nice and fuzzy inside. If you like magic this is a no brainier. If this is your first anime I think it is a great representation of what anime should be: heartfelt art. Highly recommended!!!",

            "content": "Little Witch Academy came up with an interesting premise - though not a new one - for a new Trigger series. Yoshinari as director is showing his maturation. Although the first episodes passed the impression of an experimentation, from the middle of the first cour of the series we could see sketches of serious development, small changes of tone that would make you see the characters and the story not as something episodic, as sometimes Gave the impression. The development of the main character, Akko was somewhat inaccurate, but managed to consolidate throughout the series. My only complaint with the director would be the beginning,which, as I said, passed the impression of experimentation, and also with the fact that there was no further development of the other characters; Something that the direction was due. Still the plot and the plot gave a good taste to this deficiency of the direction of the series, and knew to work with her.",

            "content": "\"It gets better as it goes in\" is definitely something someone should go into this when starting for the first time.\r\nThe first 12-13 episodes aren't the best, nothing really goes anywhere, I can describe those episodes as maybe more alike Lupin III. So if you don't have a problem with that sort of format, you'll be fine, if not, stick with it, once you get past the roadblock, it makes for some really entertaining watching.\r\nYou don't really need to have seen the OVA and movie to really understand what's going on. The show starts at Akko's induction into Luna Nova and takes off from there.However, I would recommend checking them out at least, if you can, as they're also some really good watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe world, the characters, the whole feel of the show clicked with me instantly. Each characters are varied, the clash between old magic and new modern traditions makes for some interesting scenarios that take place in the show.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, is this worth a watch? Of course. If you enjoyed Trigger's previous works, you'll most likely enjoy this. If you're like me and didn't like Kill La Kill (the only trigger series i'd heard of before starting this), it'll probably take some time before you get into it. I'd recommend the OVA and/or movie so you can get an idea about what the show is about and whether or not it is for you.",

The story came full circle and was crowned with perfect ending. \r\n      As Akko the protagonist may seem at first a bit annoying and some episodes mainly on first half for those who are not that fond of slice to life animes. The first episodes really feel like everyday occurrences in a witch academy and the pacing is a bit slow and things may get a bit repetitive. When episodes go by you realize that theydeveloped characters and relationships through that time and fro the half wayish point \"the plot\" can really kick start. \\n\r\n       There really was reason for all of things we saw and experienced and the ending is the final piece that binds everything neatly together. With Trigger-studios amazing art, especially on action scenes, the anime feels like it is pulling you in. This is a great anime as an entirety and would be a great marathon anime. This gets 9.1/10 and rounded to 9/10. It was really a delight to see the story come together at the end.",

            "content": "\u201cBelieving heart is everyone\u2019s magic\u201d\r\nThe main message of this show is really simple - believing can get you everywhere. If you think \u201chey, that\u2019s so childish and naive\u201d than, yes, you\u2019re right, it is. Even if unrealistic, it\u2019s still beautiful and somewhat motivating. This show doesn\u2019t try to be believable or even \u201cmake sense\u201d all of the time, and it isn\u2019t about that. It\u2019s about that indomitable positivity of the young heart, the one that most of us forgot about, but still have deep within. I definitely felt like a little kid when watching this series, I cherished my favorite characters, kept my fingers crossedwhen they were put to the test and felt down when they experienced hardships. But, one emotion was more significant than others - pure and uncontrollable happiness. I literally jumped on my chair when I watched final battle and couldn\u2019t stop myself from smiling in both agitation and satisfaction. Although emotionally the show had mainly positive impact on me, I can\u2019t say it was perfect or even near it\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story goes around Akko, our main character - a witch as hopeless in magic as good in staying positive despite it. Her actions are usually reckless and because of that she constantly gets into trouble. She may seem quite selfish and ego-centered at first, but as show goes we see through that first impression and are able to see that most of her \u201cmistakes\u201d are caused by her cute and harmless stupidity, not by egoism. \\n\r\nMain plot line is about collecting the \u201cWords\u201d, 7 spells which when collected have a power to break the seal of Grand Triskellion. Every word has its own meaning and represents not only plot progress, but also Akko\u2019s development as a character. The message of each word is quite simple. They are casual teachings, like \u201cbe yourself\u201d or \u201cfriendship is\u2026 nice\u201d which can be found in most tales like this.\\n\r\nWhen we don\u2019t see much innovations in that matter, execution of it is pretty nice. We really feel that acquiring and fully understanding them is associated with hardships and can only be achieved by oneself. \\n\\n\r\nStory had some plot problems. I know it is mostly directed to children, but even though, some things made absolutely 0 sens, like:\\n\r\n- Croix receiving none punishment after what she did\\n\r\n- Noone realizing that Croix is responsible for all this, when her robots fly in front of everyone's eyes all the time\\n\r\n-Ursula Sensei not telling anyone about Croix\u2019s laboratory, or even none teachers visiting it\\n\r\n-Characters completely changing personalities after one event (Croix, Daryl, etc.) \\n\r\n-and probably much more\u2026\\n\\n\r\nI think the last arc is the weakest one in the mean of plot tightness, which weakens the most emotional moments that take place in it. Overall, it is \\n\r\na entertaining story meant to make you more feel than think.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe main cast is well written, their development looks believable and their characters are interesting. We have a wide range of personalities, from Akko - imaginative and extroverted type to Lotte - soft and introverted. I think I can say, that everyone can \u201cpick\u201d something for themselves, no matter if you prefer more spontaneous and adventurous character, or the reserved and hard-working. \\n\r\nCharacters are able to surprise, even when they are present from the very beginning, we still can anticipate some major changes or at least explanations for their behaviour.\\n\r\nWhen front line characters are well developed and interesting, the further plan ones are\u2026 well made too. Really, they personalities aren\u2019t as complex, they can even be as flat as \u201cthe one who eats all the time\u201d, but they still serve a purpose in the story and aren\u2019t there just to fill the void. When you don\u2019t like every one of them, you can at least understand their actions.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is very bright and colorful, like, Really colorful. The lines are strong, but animation can get way out-shape, which results in goofy, lighthearted experience. I particularly liked the face expressions of Akko, which were able to go grotesque in a second and return to normal right away. Hair movement was pretty too, many girl had different hairstyles, so watching them fly all around when they were riding brooms was really satisfying. As to magic\u2026 I wasn\u2019t that impressed, most spells contained some green floating balls, and caused its effects in a poof of smoke...\\n\r\nThe best moment of animation and fight choreography was in the final battle against the missle. The way that Akko uses her shape-changing abilities to dodge all the attacks and counters them... It was awesome!\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nIt was great. It was mainly orchestra produced, so we are able to hear a lot of instruments. The similar motives are present throughout all the series, but many rearrangements made them sound fresh and entertaining. I said that motives repeat, but that doesn\u2019t mean, that there are a few of them, the opposite is true. I never experienced a feeling, that music repeats itself, not when it wasn\u2019t intended. When it was, like when Akko and Diana were fighting and people were cheering them it felt amazing and unique. Openings and endings were really nice, they had that light-hearted vibe and were good expositions of what we can see in the actual show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I consider this show a good entertainer. It won\u2019t force us to deep reflections or to ask ourselves philosophical questions. Even though, it isn\u2019t mindless, and shouldn\u2019t be considered as such. The message it\u2019s trying to deliver is childish and simple, yes, I agree, but that doesn\u2019t debunk it\u2019s validity. The real world isn\u2019t a place as simple and idealistic as the one portrayed in the anime, but that doesn\u2019t mean the believing heart can\u2019t spark some magic in it...\\n",

And also the same story elements being dragged on for literal episodes (WhO iS cHaRiOt GeE wHiZ iDk Is ShE sTiLl AlIvE?!?!?!!).\r\nART:\r\n9/10\r\nReallypretty, fit the story well and was fun to watch! Nothing like\u2026that hasn\u2019t been done before that blew my mind but a very pretty show!\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\n7/10\\n\r\nThe openings and ending were good, I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of it/paid a lot of attention to it, I liked the visuals of them more then the actual sounds LOL\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\n3/10\\n\r\nGimmicks. SO MANY GIMMICK CHARACTERS. There were a few with potential that I expected to learn more about like, say, Suizie and Dottie who we meet in the first episode. We get a couple episodes with them mostly featured but then that\u2019s pretty well it\u2026like I think there\u2019s just a huge portion of the show where they literally just get\u2026forgotten about LOL.\\n\r\nI like Diana and what we got to see and learn about her, she was probably one of (if not the?) best developed character, I remember the most about her.\\n\r\nAkko is a screaming girl with a dream to be the best witch and gets through life with sheer volume and plot devices, she\u2019s a fine typical MC and at least she wasn\u2019t OP like plenty of boring main characters but her trait of being \u201creally bad at magic\u201d was pretty grating at times. Also she literally worships Chariot, whatever floats your witchy boat I guess.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Chariot herself. She seemed pretty cool at first but as we learn more it seems her personality(if she had one) got extremely watered down and just\u2026dull. Like I get it, she\u2019s not a \u2018hero\u2019 or \u2018famous\u2019 anymore but to literally get rid of your personality and not really with any good reason other then \u201cI realized what I did was hOrRiBle AnD I cAn\u2019T fOrGiVe MySeLf so I became boring\u201d. Cool cool. Pretty boring resolution for her \u201carc\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThere were more characters but I don\u2019t feel like talking about them or remember much abut them LOL\u2026the one science/modern witch lady\u2026Croix I believe? She was so gimmicky it made me laugh. What a lady.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, they were all pretty flat and boring once more and more episodes showed the m=not much was going to change, maybe the manga had better development?\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was just fine\u2026fun to turn my brain off a little and watch cute girls try magic with teen drama and lots of yelling with nice animation. Wouldn\u2019t watch again, if I did I would most likely just watch the first and last episodes and just skip like the whole middle LOL\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\n5/10\\n\r\nTo quote my mom:\\n\r\n\u201cThat Akko girl sure does yell a lot of her lines\u201d\\n\\n\r\nShe was and is very right about that.",

            "content": "As a casual viewer, Little Witch Academia\u2019s went from the legendries OVAs that the show is based off of to being a Kill la Kill/Darling in the Franxx in disguised, and while both of them were very good show, they enjoyed a better focus, and ultimately much better writing that LITTLE WITCH ACADEMIA lacked to stand next to them.\r\nThose who loved KILL LA KILL and DARLING IN THE FRANXX will definitely find LITTLE WITCH ACADEMIA similar. The cast contains a mix of unique characters and favorites archetypes with an interesting and developed world. It had a clear formula that worked before in KILL LA KILLand DARLING IN THE FRANXX where the first 13 episodes is a curve up for Akko, the main character, to slowly grows as the casts are introduced and the end goal. The later episodes were used to explore more about each character, and ultimately ends in space. Trigger-y! Importantly, Akko never fell into the archetype of the \u201cfully geared main character who has beat everyone except the final boss\u201d. There\u2019s something humanizing about this, even though we all know that she will succeed. Then there\u2019s also the quality of art and sound. They were of top quality and extremely consistent no matter the episode. It\u2019s the kind of show that you would expect from Trigger, a high-quality anime that\u2019s punchy, colorful, and a go-happy adventure.\\n\r\nWhat the show suffered from is, first, a lack of focus on Magic. As a show about witches, the spells, the magic presented were uninspiring, boring and underused; it was either used as a convenient plot device or simply not used at all! For example, only a handful of the spells were introduced earlier in the show, and one would expect more interesting spell or spell interactions to be performed. Instead, we see the same spell performed over and over again uninterestingly by though around Akko, or even not at all, like when (spoiler-ish) Naomi used her wand to enhance a sword and proceeded to poke her opponent down; why wouldn\u2019t they just have a use simple spell? or how Ursula literally pulled out a light saber from her wand to fight; why? She\u2019s a powerful witch! even Constantine no longer use any magic to build her tools, which was what made her special in the OVA; now she literally pulled out an MP5 (spoiler ends), and those were just to name a few. The daily activities and action sequence, while beautifully animated, had no magic about them, Ursula even did the Naruto run in one of the sequences. With the exception to episode 12 and 13, the entire 25 episodes of the show simply lacked the magic and importantly an imagination that were showed in  the OVAs.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, all of this would\u2019ve been fine if not for the low quality of writing of the show; Those who have watched the OVAs that inspired this show will find that this is most disappointing. While the show may have got more physical actions, it is the convoluted plot that Trigger built to create drama that made it tiresome.  The biggest one is (spoiler) Croix. What was the whole point of Croix in showing magic is believing in your heart? Akko was already a commoner. Of course, it would not have matter, as the plot is carried by its character, if the writing was not so subpar. No longer are there any subtly in the conversations or in the actions of characters to shows their intentions and personalities. In its place are unnecessarily drawn out conversations, or even unnecessary episodes that ultimately achieved nothing or could\u2019ve been done in a shorter time. Take, for example, the original OVA from 2013. From how the girls talked to each other in their room, naturally expositing the world and their friendship, the little curtsy that Diana gave to Akko in the cafeteria, to the demeanor of Ursula while introducing the dungeon, to Diana and Akko interaction after the dragon was released, to how Ursula very briefly showed her identity, to Diana and Akko interaction about Chariot. In 22 minutes Sucy, Akko, Lotte, Diana, and Ursula had more personality and relationships developed between them than the first 13 episodes of the series. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, LITTLE WITCH ACADEMIA wanted to tell a shounen-esque story while its original OVAs an imaginative magical story, and that\u2019s fine. However, its writing is a disappointment and that ultimately puts it below its OVAs and other Trigger show. It\u2019s a shame, because when Trigger change to Akko from being bad with magic to struggling to use magic to the point of virtually having no magical capability at all, ironically, they also took the magic out of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs a personal note, no anime has ever made me leave a review. There are many other problems with this show, but most are subjective and could've been carried with a better writing. I\u2019m sure that there are other reviewers have already laid them out. I do not hate what they have changed about the the show, but just that it could be so much more than just another adventure anime. I suppose that I\u2019m still very much in love with the 2 OVAs and if a season 3 ever comes out I would still watch it in hope to find that magic of the show again.\\n",

            "content": "Some spoilers so bear with me.\r\nLittle Witch Academia at best can be summed up as a fun little show about friendship and adventure.\r\nIt begins with Akko attending at her first day at a magic school to become a witch and her dream is to become like her childhood idol Shiny Chariot so that she can make the world around her happy. She befriends Sucy and Latto as they go on many adventures of magic and wonder. \r\nLater on in the series, a threat emerges that could potentially plunge the world into total chaos. Akko, Sucy, Latto, and the rest of the witches team up tostop the menace and the world is saved from the threat and Akko learns what it truly means to have friends that are always there for you and she shows the world that magic still has a place in a world where magic is a nearly extinct art that has been largely forgotten by the masses.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are really fun and imaginative and each have their own unique personalities that give the characters their own defining traits that shows each character's strong and weak points that give these characters a lot of depth. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is really fluid and lively too. You really don't see a lot of anime that has animation this good. Sadly due to the high cost of producing an anime, a lot of studios have to cut corners in order to not go over the given budget. So they really outdone themselves with the animation of Little Witch Academia that it's almost movie quality animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also great too. It really fits with the tone and the theme of the series and they did a great job with the show's soundtrack because it does set the mood for the charm and setting of the series.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint that I have for this show is the story. The story isn't anything that groundbreaking or revolutionary. The story does start out okay at first, it does get a bit interesting during the middle of the show, and the ending could have been better. I wished they could have been a bit more original with the ending. How can I describe the ending? I won't go too much into detail but if you've seen how the Kid Buu Saga ends in Dragon Ball Z (you know, the ending where Mr. Hercule Satan call on the people of Earth to give Goku the energy he needs for the Spirit Bomb to defeat Kid Buu) then you've seen how Little Witch Academia ends. No really, they pulled a Dragon Ball Z as the ending for Little Witch Academia as part of the big battle that happens at the end of the show. I guess it was suppose to pay homage to Dragon Ball Z (because Little Witch Academia does make references to other works of fiction as well) but I still wished they could have been more original with the ending for this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Little Witch Academia is a fun anime that's filled with magic, wonder, great characters, great animation, and a great soundtrack. The story could have been better but at least they tried their best to make this anime a fun show to watch even if it wasn't anything groundbreaking or revolutionary as far as entertainment is concerned.\\n\\n",

I can't begin to describe the enjoyment I have watching this series.\r\nThe interesting combination of elements from cartoon and anime and the rich amount of design work put into the characters and the world somehow remind me of Avatar: The Last Airbender. Both shows make you live every emotion on the spectrum.\r\nEvery episode brings new and interesting material. I just completely love everything about this show.\r\n-Every character (primary and secondary) are compelling. They are very likeable.\r\n-The show has an episodic format without compromising progression of the main story. Every episode is fresh and there isvery good pacing.\\n\r\n-The dynamic between characters (esp. Akko & Diana)\\n\r\n-The animation's great, for an anime series, and the art direction isn't afraid from diverging from your standard anime.\\n\r\n-The OP and EDs are stunning. I am amazed by the visual effects and animations of the credits, especially.\\n\r\n-There are very good messages conveyed too, that personally resonate very strong with me!\\n\\n\r\nI've watched enough media to discern poor and masterpiece content. From the first ten minutes of Little Witch Academia, I already knew I was in for something I'd love and remember for a very long time.

            "content": "Little Witch Aca!! Overall it was a great show, pretty amazing animation throughout the whole show kinda paced a bit weirdly but  a fun watch! The characters were all simple and there was, generally a nice flow throughout the whole anime. I feel like episodes just focusing on the characters and their relationships did the best job. Its just pretty neat because most of the characters are likable and its fun to get to know more about them. The main plot is mostly pushed into the background for most episodes so we can continue to get to know the characters, which is kind ofwhat leads to all the later problems. Problems being the end,, which i don't think this is a spoiler but warning if it is: Its ending sucked a whole lot of ass. Too much is shoved in at once. A new character was introduced towards kinda abruptly and her interactions with other characters felt so off? She felt forced and her design is the most jarring if not interesting in the show which i'm not necessarily sure is a fault it just felt out of place. There's a lot of loose ideas thrown around that aren't fully addressed or flushed out like how certain machines operate, why certain things matter. *I'm gonna try to be as vague as possible* but for as many times as i had tried to watch it, whats the point of the moon scene. It feels thrown in for dramatic effect, or like a very unexplored idea. It might just be that I 'just don't get it' but when somethings leading up to one big thing, especially in a show that generally doesn't delve too deep into big ideas, the tone shift they tried to pull off was just bad.  I couldn't feel like i was enjoying what i was watching it, bc it didn't make sense. There were some cool concepts too, ideas present in the ova of a magic vs current tech struggle. At first the idea of magic taking a backseat to modern technology seems a little wild as, its fucking magic. But if magic had been around since forever of course its gonna seem outdated compared to phones that basically magic. There's this kinda B plot actually with a clash between witches and the rest of the world bc magic is outdated!! Which was a cool idea but they tried to resolve it too quickly. It felt like if they had a few more episodes and didn't have to follow a strict formulaic layout the ending would have suffered less.  Maybe all of that sounds nit picky or whatever you'd like to call it but it all adds up at the end making it feel very unsatisfying. Overall was still a good time.",

            "content": "This review has a summed up review at the top without any spoilers and a bigger review with spoilers after\r\nNon-spoiler review:\r\nStory: 9; Filled with great foreshadowing and amazing storylines, but with some plot flaws\r\nArt: 10, I don't really know what to say. Trigger always makes amazing animation, but this is incredible.\r\nMusic: 9; I loved the first OP and ED, liked the second ones less. The rest of the music was great. The use of violin was perfect for the magical school vibe\r\nCharacters: 10; I liked every single character in this show. Except for Jasminka, she was alright. They all develop as characters and we learnmore about them. This is probably my favorite cast of characters in an anime. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10; This is probably the show that I have enjoyed the most out of every single show a have seen. A combination of the characters, the story, and the art made it so fun to watch!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10; Amazing show, lacking a tiny bit in its plot\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler review: (beware, this review will probably be constructed horribly)\\n\\n\r\nThis is the second time watching this anime. I had several reasons to rewatch. The first was that I just loved it so much and I knew I had to rewatch it. Second, it was in a way the first anime I had watched (Before I had watched animes cause I wanted to watch animated series, not specifically anime which was my reason the first time. Third, my critical abilities have improved since the first-time watch it. So here we go, my review for LWA\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nThis plot had many things that I loved. I loved the way that they don't keep Ursula real name a secret just so that the reveal can be in the last episodes. If someone knows that she is really chariot and no one around them can't know about it, then they're going to say her real name. Example, when it's the blue moon night and Ursula finds Akko in the cave. The green leaf witch says Chariot instead of Ursula cause there's no reason for her to say her fake name, Ursula. \\n\r\nI also loved the message in the show. I don't really know if I want to call it a message. But the story, in my opinion, I kind of about a wrong way of idolizing someone. Something you can easily see in the show is that Akko loved Chariot and wants to be like her. She was basically perfect to her. But then she hears that she is the reason that she can't use magic, she wasn't perfect. I haven't really seen a show about this. How idolization can go too far. \\n\r\nNext, character presentation. This was actually really well made. First Akko, in the first scene that she is in we see that she is happy, energetic and overall positive. This perfectly shows what personality she has. Next, Sucy. The first she is in she keeps quiet and she pranks Akko as she follows her. Again, this shows perfectly who she is. Next, Lotte. She seems to be awkward and shy, but not to the extreme. The presentations I would have liked to be better was Constanze and Jasminka. They are introduced in the episode where they first learn to fly. But the way that they introduce them was by making Jasminka eat some chips and make Constanze build something. I wasn't really a fan of this way of introduction. But in the next scene we see that Constanze has upgraded her broom with machineries. This would have been a way better way to introduce Constanze.\\n\r\nNext, the foreshadowing. Wow, the first scene had an incredible amount of foreshadowing. You could see Diana, you could see how the magic in the audience escaped everyone and you could see one of those red cube monsters. You can even see in Ursula's face reactions when someone speaks badly of Chariot. \\n\r\nNext, how it makes sense that Akko become friends with Andrew and Diana. Both of they're families are of high stature. They don't really get encouragements from anyone, but when Akko comes she changes that. She is the puzzle piece that both needed in their life. You can even see in the second episode when Akko makes all the butterflies bloom that Diana sees chariot in her.\\n\r\nBut there also many small things I loved about the story. Like how Sucy is basically only in the school to get more mushrooms. The first day of the school again presents the characters very good. How Sucy is only focused on the chemistry class, Lotte is focused on everything and Akko finds everything boring cause Chariot was the person to introduce magic into her life. How Akko becomes quieter about Chariot after hearing how annoying Lottes fandom could be. How you could see a big contrast between Akko's and Lotte's idolization, how one wants to be exactly like their idol and one doesn't. How Akko's and Amanda's friendship starts with their hate for Diana. That there's a reason why Akko is worse at magic than her classmates more than her not being raised as a witch. Episode 8 was just great, had so many creative ideas. The theme of Akko trying to bring back magic like it was in the golden magic ages. How Ursula can give perfect advice for Akko cause she knows what she has to do to get all the words. The end of the \"first season\" was great. How Akko showed the school that you don't need to make something the same way every time to make something amazing. You get why Akko likes Croix, cause Croix wants to change a lot in the school which Akko admires, cause she likes change too. \\n\\n\r\nBut since I gave the story a 9 I had a few problems. Most of them were very small, but here are some bigger ones:\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 10 Andrew and Diana seem to have a very good relationship. But the last time we saw them together it didn't feel that way.\\n\r\nI still don't know what Croix was a teacher for.\\n\r\nHow did Constanze get a mega room under her dorm? Did the school allow that?\\n\r\nThey could have been more subtle of why Croix is trying to make sure Akko doesn't find all the words.\\n\r\nCroix lied to Akko about when the tree would spread the poison, and Akko still trusts her\\n\r\nSeems a little weird how mad everyone got for a soccer match. I mean, riots for several days. I don't think that would ever happen\\n\r\nWhy was it Diana that was with Akko when destroying the missile? Why not Lotte and Sucy? They were your friends from the beginning. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nHonestly, this is probably my favorite animation I have ever seen in an anime (tied with your name). It felt like every episode had a moment where the animation would completely steal the show. Trigger has always had great animation, but this was incredible.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nI loved the first OP and ED. The second OP and ED weren't as good. The use of violin was great in the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis is probably my favorite cast of characters I have seen in an anime, and here's why. \\n\r\nFirst the three main characters. Akko isn't one-sided, she had development and was very likable, making her into a very good character. Then we have Lotte who is a little more one-sided but definitely not too one-sided. I would have liked more development for her, other than that she was really good. Then there was Sucy, wow. I loved her. She is probably the funniest anime characters I have seen. Just her being there and saying something in character would be funny. She was very one-sided and not very developed but I think I liked that about her. Then we have some side-characters that are all great. They're all developed (except Jasminka) and have good personalities. I really liked Andrew and Diana's development throughout the show. And I just want to say how good Chariot was. She was nice to everyone, had a cool backstory but she has made mistakes that people have been affected by. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This was amazingly fun to watch. It was funny, had many emotional moments and the animation makes it good to look at. \\n\\n\r\nOther: \\n\r\nThe voice actor choice was perfect for sucy!\\n\r\nConstanze has a gun. How can a character get better?\\n\r\nOMG THEY DID A YOUR NAME REFRENCE!!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I think this is an amazing show that you should definitely watch",

            "content": "Why You Should Watch Little Witch Academia\r\nI\u2019ve fallen in love with the Netflix series Little Witch Academia.\r\nLWA follows Akko Kagari who, despite having no natural aptitude for magic, enrolls at Luna Nova Witchcraft Academy to follow in the footsteps of her hero, the legendary witch Shiny Chariot. What I absolutely adore about LWA is how it perfectly combines elements of Western and Eastern animation/storytelling. On the Western side, it\u2019s obvious the premise of the show was inspired by Harry Potter. Like Harry, Akko herself has no magic experience before being whisked away to magic school where she meets a blonde Malfoy-esque rival character in Diana,complete with her own Crabbe and Goyle equivalents. There are even little references to Harry Potter sprinkled in: magic is powered by the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone and there\u2019s a broomstick called the Shooting Star. On the Eastern side, many of the characters are rooted in Japanese archetypes including Genki (Akko), Meganekko (Lotte), Kamidere (Diana), and Bokukko (Amanda). However, their characterizations are subtle enough to overcome cultural barriers and fit perfectly into a Western style story. This East meets West style can even be seen in the animation and art which are reminiscent of early Disney, conveying a sense of wonder and energy yet still being rooted in anime aesthetics - imagine mixing The Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentice from Fantasia and giving it an anime coat of paint. Add to that excellent acting in either English or Japanese and this melting pot of cultures can be enjoyed by anyone and is the perfect show to watch with younger siblings. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately if Avatar the Last Airbender is what happens when Western creators look eastward for inspiration, Little Witch Academia is what happens when Eastern creators look westward. Do yourselves a solid and watch this show!\\n\\n\r\nHOW TO WATCH\\n\r\nThere are 2 specials, which essentially act as pilots, and a 25-episode series. If you\u2019re already sold I recommend starting with the specials (Little Witch Academia, followed by the Enchanted Parade), then watching the series. If not, start with the series (which I feel does a better job at selling the series) then go back to the specials.\\n",

There are a lot of references in this series which I enjoyed and after comparing it to the movie(2013), I am glad that they totally changed the script and such.\r\nFinal Fantasy VI(5th) and Mother 3(1st) are one of my top 5 favorite video games of all time and if I am to combine them(plus a good protagonist that doesn't much complain the whole freakin time), this will be the outcome, and I'm not mad at all. Both of these games are masterpieces not only in thegaming industry, but also in my heart, so the story will receive a 10\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound are very good(8). Not that great as to other anime during their time, but it's very good. It somehow follows the theme of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, all of them are lovable, one of them may be like one of those cliche bullies, but there's character development there, so it's a 10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series as much as I enjoyed playing Mother 3(minus the tears because this anime doesn't made me cry), so the enjoyment is OBVIOUSLY a 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'll say that Little Witch Academia is a mediocre-to-masterpiece anime. If I am to watch the movie first, I would totally not find this anime series interesting, but I'm really glad they changed the whole plot.\\n\\n\r\nP.S Disney is not anime.",

            "content": "I'll keep this short.\r\nFor those interesting in watching, I'd recommend it. It has a nostalgic feel and a cliche main character. If you've seen Black Clover, the main character is just like that. Very similar to a typical shonen.\r\nI'll say that the idea of the story is great, but the execution seemed flawed. That's probably because the episodes were limited. A majority of the episodes feel like filler, but that is because there is no true objective at least until we are near the end. But, even then, the main antagonist does not really seem like one either.\r\nOne thing that makes the main character bothunique and annoying is how she gains new powers. To avoid spoiling, I'll just say that she can become stronger by doing every day tasks and getting lucky. Most of her big power ups happen in what feels like filler episodes. Nearly every single important moment feels out of place for me.\\n\\n\r\nDespite some all of these flaws, I couldn't help but smile at the main character's attitude. It felt genuine, which is something most cannot pull off. I would still recommend watching this to anyone, but I would highly recommend it to a younger audience.",

            "content": "Overall - 7:\r\nThis anime was beautiful to look at, and alright to watch. The characters were great, but the plot was boring and relies on the audience accepting what the show does, weather or not it makes a whole lot of sense.\r\nStory - 5:\r\nLike most shows that have magic, you can't possibly hope to have everything make sense. If you want to have a fluid story that isn't just 20 minutes of explaining you can focus on the how of everything, and this show knows that. I don't really like shows with magic and that is why, but there is another issue, at least forme when it comes to this anime, and that is the overall story being too simple. Most of the episodes focus on single things, some of which loosely tie in to the overall story. There's nothing necessarily wrong with this, I just don't like it as much as a well written coherent story where each episode is part of a large story. The ending was good, simple, somewhat predictable, but great nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10:\\n\r\nStudio trigger's art is always amazing, this show is no exception. From the simple scenes of the characters in their room to the amazing action packed fight sequences, the art never fails to be amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 5:\\n\r\nI'm honestly pretty disappointed in the soundtrack, they have literally one good melody and most of the good songs in the soundtrack are rehasings of it. The soundtrack does it's job, but it could have been a lot better.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10:\\n\r\nI'm very impressed with the level of character diversity in this show. Just design wise the characters look quite different from one another, and their personalities are also very unique to who they are. The character interactions take up a good portion of the anime, and that is probably the best part (at least when it's not essentially the same character interaction done again and again because the plot has it be that way.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7:\\n\r\nI had a good time watching this show, but it didn't really have me wanting to watch, just one more episode every time. It was more of a \"I should watch an episode of that now, since I have time\". The show was always great to look at, but episode to episode there wasn't much that made me eager to come back for more.",

            "content": "Little Witch Academia! Damn. For all the anime i started watching without knowing anything prior, this one really takes the top! Since i started re-watching anime, i was kinda lost because i was out of touch with anime for so long. I've only briefly seen few recommendations here and there. So, i decided to try something different, that is to watch new anime series/ adaptations without knowing or hearing anything prior, only going into it with the knowledge of the synopsis. Anime series like Gabriel Dropout was nice, and Demi-chan wa Kataritai was ok, and then... i came across Little Witch Academia. To be reallyhonest, i was not expecting much since i never even knew it existed and the artwork did nothing to increase my hopes for this show. Oh, how wrong i was. It was great! Better than great, it was awesome, and seriously under-rated a 25 episode show. \\n\\n\r\nPlotline 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe plot starts off as many others do, with the main character dreaming to aim for the top of the field, just like their idols... except this character was hopelessly useless... at mostly EVERYTHING, and had horrible luck and an aggressive attitude to boot. Nevertheless, this useless character is what made the story interesting. Since she is not overpowered, she uses her quick wits and passion to solve problems that skilled talent would not. This introduces a kind of witty comedy that made me eager for more! The plot itself doesn't really get under way until well in the middle of the series. But honestly, it didn't really bother me since the pre-slice of life episodes were really fun to watch! The story itself actually isn't that bad either. What started as a quest to find an idol turned out to be something much more and to be fair, the climax was much surprising to me. The great thing about the plot is that it doesn't turn out to be needlessly complicated as many anime does, especially those involving magic. The story is simple, yet engaging, and also adds in twist of wittiness and ingenious methods to make it more interesting, all the while wrapping it perfectly into one ending in one season. To be honest, i hope they didn't have a 2nd season just because of how nicely everything ended.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the more shocking review sections, even for me. When one sees the artwork cover for Little Witch Academia, one doesn't even imagine the graphic is anything to be admired. Yet, for some reason, it all works really well! I was so shocked to find out how well it worked out for the entire theme of the show. Sure, i know that the graphics seem really out of date for something in 2017 but here's the thing! It actually works with the show! In contrast, if the graphics were to be modernised, it would actually RUIN the show and its setting. The jumpy characters, the relaxing atmosphere and the spells are all nicely fitted into the artwork, creating a casual yet nicely framed environment.\\n\\n\r\nMusic 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say here, i like the music. Sure, it's not Re-zero material, but it's quite pleasing to hear. Oh, the one that made all the difference! The ending. Here's an honest fact about me. Usually, when an anime ends, i skip without even listening to the ending theme, maybe only watching it once for the ending credits animation. But, in Little Witch Academia, the credits are special. In every single credit sequence, iconic scenes from the current episodes are always shown. I kinda liked it and always stay back just to relieve the episode for another 1 to 2 min or so. I think it's a nice little gesture for viewers to relax in accompaniment to the music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters were lovable, with decent development, and character traits that were distinguishable even without speaking (literally if you know what i mean ;) ). None of them were annoying and that is the most important point for me as them being annoying would severely ruin this show. Although, there were 3 characters i had to mention that were nothing but the best characters for me in the show. SPOILERS AHEAD:\\n\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\r\nAkko - Main character, jumpy, unlucky, sucks at magic, and has a great \\n\r\n          passion, ingenious wits. I just adore her! Even though she fits right into the misread, mischievous, misconduct and miserable main character category, something about her just makes her all the more different from all of them! Her hardworking self makes me want to cheer, her passion moves me, her wittiness makes me laugh, her angry pouts are so adorable and her transformations are so CUTE! I mean, don't deny it! Her metamorphy faciesse is simply CUTE!\\n\\n\r\nDiana - Cold, Cool, Talented All-round Rich girl. What? Sounds like a snob?\\n\r\n           Good sir, Diana is the BEST! She's not even half an inch snob!! She's helpful, kind, often misunderstood, and hides a nature of hers she didn't want to show others just because she doesn't want to burden them! I never hated her once, from the beginning till the end. Her episode was just tear jerking.\\n\\n\r\nShiny Chariot / Ursula - Man, i could relate to her so much. Her character \\n\r\n                                  backdrop just goes to show that talented people are the often the ones that feel most stressed and troubled behind their smiles. Often burden with wanting to make people happy, she ended up hurting more people than she had intended, and having to retire from her idol career and abandon her dream to watch people smile. She is the true definition of a fallen angel.\\n\\n\r\n*** SPOILERS END HERE\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (Personal Enjoyment) :\\n\\n\r\nEven with no knowledge on the show whatever, this show was really great. It hit me hard with laughter the first episode and with so much feels by the end of the 25 episodes run. I enjoyed it a whole lot, and it made me understand just what people mean by there's a whole lot of under rated anime and not just popular ones like Naruto, One Piece, and Fate series. Honestly, i don't think you will regret watching Little Witch Academia.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Do you ever wonder \"What if Harry Potter were actually good?\" Okay, maybe that's too harsh to Harry Potter. What about \"What if Harry Potter were an anime?\" Um, maybe I'm getting off point here. Anyway, it has magic, so that reminds me of Harry Potter.\r\nDo you know that part at the end of Just Cause 2 where Rico grapples between missiles while they're in the air and he has to diffuse them before they blow up an oil field? Yeah, that's a pretty cool scene, and this show has just as climactic an ending, I won't spoil it here.\r\nBut overall, what makes this showgreat is the comedy. It's refreshingly actually funny. I don't watch that much comedy anime because I don't find it that interesting as a general rule. It tends to lose my interest very quickly. But this one managed to remain interesting. The episodes are mainly self-contained, but towards the end there starts to be more of a continuous plot. Despite this, each episode manages to be interesting, and drives forward the characters' relationships. By the end of the show you grow to know and love a large number of them, even the side characters. Most characters have at least one episode about them.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, of course, is excellent. As to be expected from Trigger. It's not as incredible as Kill La Kill, but it's solid throughout, especially in the character design. Each character is distinctive in a way that matches their personality.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd strongly recommend it. It's no Madoka Magica, but then again, few things are.",

            "content": "\"A believing heart is my magic.\" Little Witch Academia is not just a show about magic, it is a magical show in itself. Most of the show takes on an episodic format where Akko and her friends are cast into a whole range of problems that need solving. The story is masterfully pieced together so that these episodic tales become highly relevant to the overarching plot of the show.\r\nAkko's journey to meet Shiny Chariot is one full of charm. The world of Luna Nova is full of breathtaking environments and the team at Trigger have created a truly magical world. Trigger's unique and playful animationtechniques have been used to their full effect to make the characters and the world they inhibit as vibrant as they can be. The show is full of references to western media and also previous Trigger works.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is fantastic and every track is full of the essence of adventure. The main theme in particular made me reach Kill La Kill levels of excitement. \\n\\n\r\nIt's always refreshing to see a character who has to struggle to become good at something. Akko is hardly witch material, but she endures the mockery of those around her so that she can fulfill her dream of meeting her idol and using magic to make people happy. I think some of that magic may have seeped into reality, because I was certainly happy when watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nTrigger continues to show that it is possible to create a strong female cast of characters, with each one being distinct and memorable. Just like the shows before it LWA does not hold back on its craziness and it makes this a series to remember. All fans can hope for now is that a season 2 happens.",

            "content": "Where to begin? Maybe to where I know this anime first. \r\nThis anime started as a stand-alone movie, if I am not mistaken it had two movies where they are introducing the characters that we will meet later on the series.\r\nAfter the series started, fans that have found this before, will know that it doesn't follow the movies. It started from the start to much my dismay. Anyhow let's get back to rating.\r\nStory (10) - Since I was excited about this series, I know that the anime will not disappoint me, and I was right, although the first episode had me confused, it took mea while to realize the studio decided to start from scratch but it stayed quite the same, only different interpretation. I tried predicting about the reason why the main character couldn't do certain magic, but at the end. It got me by surprise, this anime never fails to amaze you.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10) - Pretty much original, each characters are different from each other and yet they are still easily to be remembered. Aside from the characters, I really like how they do their scenery, the lightning, it gives us more atmospheric feeling and it doesn't bore us out. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8) - Well, the soundtracks make the Shiny Rod amazing, but I don't really remember much of it because I was set focused on the episode, meaning I enjoy the story more than concentrating to the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10) - Well, plenty of character development here, but we have a Mary Sue character (Diana), but later on the series, she has given a background story as well, where it makes you feel bad about what you have thought about her in the beginning. It made sure that the really important characters get backstories. Even minor characters, they have some small background stories that are not really quite relevant to the series yet it was there, to know why they are like that. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10) - There is never an episode where I had to say, \"I will just skip some part of this anime\", I tend to do that, but it never gave me that feeling. I was constantly curious how it will end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Well, certainly an anime that has the Harry Potter vibe on it, but this anime is unique. You don't see a lot of anime that has a school and witches on it that actually make sense.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this review!\\n\r\nHave a nice day everyone!",

            "content": "And I guess we have another winner here coming from Anime Mirai. For those not in the know, Little Witch Academia was originally made as an animated short for an annual Japanese animator's project called Anime Mirai for aspiring young animators to create their own unique works. The short's popularity with fans eventually led to a Kickstarter-funded film project to be brought about in 2015 and later led to this TV anime that aired, the second one made from an Anime Mirai short since the 2015 premiere of Death Parade. Focused on a young girl named Akko aspiring to be a witch in spite oflacking any aptitude in magic, our main heroine enrolls into the Luna Nova Magical Academy to receive witch training, getting caught up in some of the antics of her classmates, and trying to seek out magical words connected to a mysterious magic wand called the Shiny Rod that belonged to Akko's idol, the stage magician Shiny Chariot.\\n\\n\r\nThis TV anime expands a great deal on exploring the world of Little Witch Academia with the large amount of time that the format provides it. Besides Akko, a good number of the witches at Luna Nova get a good deal of focus and development into their characters that help flesh them out. There's enough time for the TV format as such where some new characters are even brought into the series with witches and non-magic folk that include new witch instructor Croix and young aristocrat Andrew Hanbridge. The series even takes the time to explore how magic works within the world of the series, with a major story element in the series being magic becoming increasingly scarce for use by witches and any spiritual familiars that draw upon it to sustain themselves, thus affecting the status of Luna Nova Academy.\\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of Akko and the mentioned magic crisis, these two mentioned situations are consistently entwined with one another throughout much of Little Witch Academia. With Akko gaining possession of the Shiny Rod, she comes to discover that she has to unlock specific words to it in order to tap more into its powers. Without spoiling too much, the discovery of the words to the Shiny Rod are connected to Akko's character development throughout the series where she tries to defy the magical traditions of Luna Nova to show she can gain the power to become a witch through hard work, perseverance, faith in one self, and trusting in others. These story elements take on more prominence in the show's second half when more about the Shiny Rod's purpose and origins are revealed, and what connection it has to Akko's idol, Shiny Chariot (who is revealed quite early on to be much closer to Akko than she would expect).\\n\\n\r\nSetting aside these serious elements, what perhaps makes Little Little Academia one of the year's best titles for me is how unique it sticks out. It avoids going into many of the typical storytelling cliches that many modern anime would lazily get into and offers a Western-inspired look at a world of magic that is rarely focused on within many anime titles. In addition, it strikes a nice balance of comedy and drama to focus on the developments of the witches at Luna Nova and its main plot of Akko's quest to learn more about the Shiny Rod, while also being very accessible to Western audiences with its family-friendly content and optimistic themes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Little Witch Academia made for one of the best viewing experiences for an anime for the year thus far thanks to its unique premise on Western-influenced magic and the developments concerning Akko and the Shiny Rod. Being very accessible to wide audiences with its premise and having a nice balance of comedy, adventure, and drama, the series is a definite recommendation I would make as a fan and one that could also be used as a possible \"gateway drug\" to draw in new or casual fans to the world of anime.",

            "content": "This will be the best show that no one will watch this season. If you are not aware, there is a big commotion with Netflix only just releasing LWA on their streaming platform, and when they did, it was only half the season.\r\nThat aside, this show is simply charming. I have always said that Trigger is the best at selling a feeling. Whatever Trigger wants you to feel, it makes you feel that. If that's what you want from anime, just stop reading and go watch the show however you can. Or you can keep reading, no spoilers ahead.\r\nEverything about the show adds to theenjoyment. The characters that you loved from the OVA and the movie are still here and are more consequential than expected. Its a nice surprise to see a show that starts with the intention to make a well written story and be one cohesive whole. Honestly, just go watch the show, especially if you want a fun warm time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I feel I should be more critical now, because the show is not perfect. In the grading portion, I gave it a seven, not because the show is poorly written, because it, like the rest of LWA's components are simply outstanding, but the plot is about the least original part of the show. There are twists and turns that make you go oh, but for me, I saw it all coming.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the answer to that is that this show isn't about the plot but about the friendships Akko builds with the other character, but I disagree. Sure, the other properties seemed to do the whole \"friendship is magic\" angle, but in the show, we are treated with themes of creating your own self value, and knowing the world and the role you can play in it. The phrase from the show, \"Akko doesn't believe in miracles, but she has always believed in herself\" comes to mind. But back to why I gave this portion a seven, this kind of story necessitated a stronger plot focus and I feel that is a shortcoming of the show. I think most would agree that they didn't watch because they cared about the plot.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the show is fantastic. Its visually intense and you find yourself looking at everything, whether it is the lore steeped vistas they locale or the titles of the books that the characters have in their rooms. There is a clear astronomical amount of detail poured into the show and all of Triggers strengths, visuals, design, action and creating characters you want to succeed.\\n\\n\r\nAny more to say about the show is unnecessary. If you are a Trigger fan, its Kill la Kill wearing robes and practicing magic. If you're not a fan of Trigger's past works, this is still a beautifully crafted show that any reviewer worth his words would recommend. \\n\\n\r\nThere is something here for everyone, and I am sure you can find what you want with this show.",

            "content": "\"A believing heart is [the] magic!\" -- spoiler free, as best as can be\r\nI believe this phrase sums up the show fairly well, ('the' in place of 'your' ofc). \r\nIt's fairly easy to pick apart this show, and find the many apparent flaws in the main four categories provided by MyAnimeList. That is, there are quite a few things lacking in the story and character (development) department, as well as (but notably less) in the art and sound aspects. But looking at this show from any other angle than holistically does it a major disservice. \r\nI'll avoid a simple regurgitation of the plot, but Ido need to add a brief synopsis in order to aid my review- So, there's a girl named Atsuko Kagari (Akko), who stumbles upon a make-shift hogwarts. And, much like my man Harry Potter, she's enveloped by a world of magic completely unfamiliar to her that she must traverse. And with the help of her friends, she will fulfill her destiny and become a great witch, following in the footsteps of her idol Dumbledore-- and that's what I believe is the real catch of the show. \\n\\n\r\nTying back into the quote I highlighted earlier, Akko, aside from the whole contrived destiny thing, is the epitome of the underdog and there is no greater elation I feel than being able to root for the underdog. It is such a relatable feeling to see someone start from nothing, and slowly (painfully slow, at times) become stronger, and I genuinely enjoy watching any show with that archetype-- no matter how cliche it is. It's not just Akko either, all of the characters (well, most) are lacking something, that prevents them from being pretentious extras, that waste screen time, but instead admirable individuals with their own quirky, yet amiable, personalities. This passive fervor, led by the eccentric Akko doesn't make each episode ground-breaking, but heartwarming. An exceptional take on the classic \"the fun is in the journey, not the destination.\"\\n\\n\r\n...Which actually leads to some of my gripes with the show. As much as I would like to say otherwise, I'd be lying to myself (and y'all), if I didn't say there were quite a few problems that I felt arose with the show. I'll try to explain myself well, while relatively spoiler-free.\\n\\n\r\nThe story felt contrived. I would have honestly enjoyed stand-alone episodes, with a supernatural slice-of-life-esque feel, much like the first half of the show. That's not the say that her \"destiny\" didn't make sense, it's just that at times it felt a lot more like her \"fate\" than a \"destiny.\" \\n\\n\r\nTo clarify, I have no problem with her being \"the chosen one,\" but that doesn't mean every problem that arises should be conveniently solved with recently learned magic. Now, to be fair, it was highly unlikely to begin with that Akko would ever drastically fail-- it would have created drastic, dark undertones to an otherwise shiny, sublime, sparkle-drenched universe. And I don't think it would have been as impactful Madoka Magica, anyway. \\n\\n\r\nThis, coupled with what I felt were severely rushed episodes, raises the question of \"Why even create these problems in the first place?\" It really takes away from the aforementioned charm of an underdog story, when the underdog is presented with a problem, and it's solved in the same episode (or early in the next) with some super convenient power because 'plot'. They try to defend it by her \"learning a lesson,\" but no. It just- no.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, some of the characters that I fell in love with in the movie, got little to no screen time in pursuit of this one-sided war of a plot (yes you, Constanze Amalie von Braunschbank Albrechtsberger). Even the two best friends come and go at the drop of a hat. \\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, the art is breathtaking. The style is unique, and whimsical, and really adds to the childlike wonder that I think the writer wanted to create. The OST is outstanding, really, it emphasizes the vibrancy of our heroine's(s') journey, while adding just a hint mystery as if to say, in it's own way, \"Next stop, everywhere!\"  If you haven't yet listened to the different soundtracks, I would highly suggest you do so-- starting with Chariot's Theme. (Just looked it up, most of the OST is copyright on Y----be)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say it's worth a watch. Don't expect anything momentous like the next Neon Genesis, or Madoka Magica, but instead be swept off your feet with an effervescent take on the classic hero's journey.",

I post this review one episode away from the final with the context that I have watched all of the movies. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nHonestly, Little witch academia's weak point is it's story telling; it was not bad by any means, but was in no way gripping either. Near the end it gets better story wise (no spoilers) but the anime is pretty episodic; Akko goes on adventures, develops her skills as a witch, helps others witha running motive-nothing special but definitely more suited as a tv series this way, though admittedly, some episodes stood out more than others. Just don't expect a ground breaking running plot or anything.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nI personally liked the art, it wasn't glittery and detailed like you'd see in most anime but it really made the animation feel alive. The characters were expressive, the movements fluid, and pretty much easy on the eyes to look at. (I may be biased though, I watched videos of how the animation was made)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs were very catchy and fun to listen to. It definitely fits the vibe of the show well: childish, magical and vivid.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nI liked the characters but alot of them didn't stand out to me as much as others. There were a few episodes focused on each character individually, but I just couldn't find it in me to appreciate all of them (maybe I did at one point, but then forgot later). A few characters had their time to shine throughout the show but I felt as if some were a bit weak considering they were meant to be reoccurring characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really liked Little Witch academia and it remained one of the shows I was most invested in this season, despite there being highly competitive series like boku no hero and attack on titan. The show is a nice watch of you don't want too much drama or something too intense to watch in your spare time. Has a nice touch of nostalgia too.",

            "content": "Rash, clumsy and happy-go-lucky \"Akko\" is a normal human girl inspired to become a witch after watching a magical performance by the witch, Chariot. By chance she manages to obtain the Shiny Rod from the forbidden forest, the same rod that Chariot had used before disappearing and she suddenly finds herself capable of some powerful magic. Along the way she befriends the mischievous poison mushroom loving Suzy and timid Lotte. Together, they start the new term at the famous Luna Nova Academy for witches as Akko strives to be like Chariot despite magic growing less appealing to the modern day world by the day.\r\nThe showwhich started of as a crowd-funded short film, feels very much like the action comedy you'd expect from Trigger featuring a silly cast of characters. I guess you could say it's a different kind of \"magical girl\" show. Right from the very first episode you're already laughing away at the antics Akko gets up to that throws her into trouble's way and all the silly comical reactions. You'd probably recognise some familiar styles from the studio too, especially the sparkly stars.\\n\\n\r\nGranted it's not a serious show, I think the only things that stops me from recommending it is the world setting and pacing. Even though it tries to deviate from the common magical fantasy setting with silly ideas such as witches using machinery instead of magic, it's not that exciting to look at.\\n\\n\r\nFor the first half it kind of felt like a slice-of-life show (about witches in training of course) and sometimes it felt like I was watching a Nickelodeon cartoon from my childhood days so not quite as entertaining... The main plot does finally pick up traction by the second half of the show and as cheezy as it maybe, the wrap-up was great but the overall pacing and direction just felt too slow. Kind of like that long climb up a roller coaster except this climb was too long and I almost lost interest. Maybe not one of Trigger's better shows.\\n\\n\r\nOn another note, Diana really looks like Luna Lovegood from Harry Potter, lol. And if you do watch this, do look out for \"Marks & Sponcers\" if you're familiar with British stores. The second ED, \"Invisible Wings\" is also a great theme song.",
