            "content": "Sex, lewd thoughts, and imaginations. Here's an interesting little trivia: Did you know that the average man in our world today think about sex nearly every 56 seconds? Fact or fiction, you decide. Of course, this is all normal. I mean, our minds is filled with all sorts of imaginations and dreams whether it'd be finding the perfect girlfriend or going on your first dream date. In this anime known as the High School DxD, our protagonist Hyudo Iseei goes from a lecherous second-year high school student attending Kuoh Academy to someone he hasn't began to imagine before.\r\nAt first glance, the title High School DxDdoesn't really stand out much. The first two words \u201chigh school\u201d is probably a place most of us made good (or bad memories) in our lives. Of course, Issei hopes to make good memories because the school has recently turned into co-ed from a former girls-only school. And where else would a healthy boy at his puberty stage wants to make most of it? High school of course. But not all is easy as he is known to be creepy at the academy. With few \u201creal\u201d friends, the chances of making his goal of high school memories is becoming slim.\\n\\n\r\nThat of course later changes when the unthinkable happens and he is killed by his very first girlfriend. Talk about bad luck, I can only think of one person off my head right now with the Imagine Breaker with that sort of luck. But is this really bad luck? Because the most beautiful and respected character of the school and series takes attention of him...\\n\\n\r\nFirst, we have the beautiful Rias Gremory. She is someone everyone admires and lusts about. She is the president of the Occult Club. And she is of course, the main heroine as well as one of the reasons some of us are watching this series for the lulz. She takes a curious interest in our protagonist Issei after the incident but what really makes her unique is her definite character. Behind her outer shell is a girl who takes responsibility and does what she does best: helping others. These traits seem to pass onto Issei for despite his creepiness around the academy, he is known to be helpful and hardworking.\\n\\n\r\nThen, we have some of the other characters. The sadistic Akeno who is also admired among the academy. Playful and flirtatious, she plays the role of the one-sama whom a lot of us wants to be \u201ctreated\u201d by her. Then, we have our mascot, the all adorable loli Koneko-chan. Behind that cute loli apperance lies a girl of power and valor who puts her own life at risk to help others. Next, we have Asia-san, the pure girl that reflects the innocence of the series after all the lewd story arcs and peerage. Finally, we have Kiba who serves as the antithesis of Issei, whom he despises to no end. And of course, all these characters of the Occult Club are the bridge to Issei's path of becoming someone who he never thought he'd be.\\n\\n\r\nBy this point, some of you reading this review are probably thinking \u201cgod damn it, not another harem\u201d or \u201cfan-service...what else is new?\u201d And of course, I agree there. Fan-service is nothing new but a device used to attract viewers. So, if you can't take the boobs, ass, and nudity, then feel free to watch another series. If you have a serious issue with the uncensored scenes and fan-service, then just drop the damn series as no one is forcing you to watch. However, if you can take it like a true anime fan, then kudos to you as you will be proud once you complete perhaps the ecchiest (if that's even a word) series of this year 2012.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this series is just meh for me. I didn't take much notice of it as most people are probably paying attention more to the action and fan-service than art when watching this. I don't blame you, I mean who could take their eyes off one second of that million dollar body of Rias Gremory? :) Then, of course, the sound. I do admit that it does mixes in well especially in later episodes where the seriousness conveys the more dramatic visage of the story. It's not as powerful as Yuki Kajiura's soundtracks from Mai-Hime or Tsubusa Chronicles but still all in all, it does fit well once you listen to it carefully.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being labelled as a ecchi and even harem on MAL, this series does have a storyline. Yes, can you believe it? An actual ecchi anime with a decent storyline! As such in series like this, you can expect the master and slave relationship. One catch though. This time, the girl is the master. Some of the viewers watching this may now think about the typical \u201cmaster/slave\u201d fantasies or \u201cking's game\u201d from your heads now. However, behind the scenes of the fan-service and nudity lies a story where a young boy goes from zero to hero. The storyline gets deeper in the light novels but the anime isn't all too shabby. It starts off as a predictable opening, goes to a more emotional setting, and then goes out with a bang. A literal bang thanks to what Issei learns and became throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nSo, you're probably asking yourself now: \u201cshould I watch this?\u201d Honestly, that's an ambigious question. When God gave us brains, we all have different views on everything like anime, manga, life, appearances, etc. However, if you just watched the trailer or first 5 mins of the series and decided to hit that drop button, then I feel really sorry for you. Why? Because this series is more than just about ecchi and fan-service. It has potential. It has emotion. It has drama. It has interest.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have serious problems with watching this anime, then maybe think about your High School memories. I bet Issei's virginity that the memories of your High School years won't be that much better than this series. (well, at least for me)",

            "content": "Surprisingly, despite this being labeled as \"harem,\" this show didn't feel much like harem to me. Really strange. In fact, Sword Art Online felt even more of a harem than this, but ok. Issei only had like one real love interest, and that was Rias. Maybe it's the perspective of socially awkward people who think that if a girl talks to a guy, that means that the girl is in love with the guy that makes them think this is a harem. So I guess harem now means having a bunch of female characters and having one relevant male character in a same show. Oh,and I guess the main character constantly went on about how he likes harem or something. But I'm pretty sure that doesn't qualify a show as harem either.\\n\\n\r\nObviously one of the most important factors in these shows is the main protagonist. Everything centers around them, after all. Harem genre in general, unfortunately, does not have much variety in what main characters they could have. Very rarely you have protagonists like Keima, who is on a class of his own, or Shidou, who's at least likeable despite being incredibly generic just because he's not an annoying piece of shit that causes more problems for himself than everything else in the show. And then you have Issei. This protagonist just happens to be one of the obnoxious protagonists you could have in a show, harem or not. Did you ever watch other shows and saw that silly \"perverted guy\" who always hangs out near the main character and only exists as a brief comic relief? Yeah, that guy is a main protagonist now. Hope you liked those brief comic reliefs, because that's definitely not going to get old after an entire series. \\n\\n\r\nIf that wasn't bad enough, he's also \"that\" guy who happens to have one of the most powerful McGuffins in the series, which makes him suddenly important. Normally this wouldn't be too offensive since it's done by literally every other show, where the protagonist happens to have that special trait that gives him unfair advantage no matter what, but the way this show handles it is just terrible. \\n\\n\r\nYou see, the side characters that Rias has under her are supposed to represent what Issei lacks- Outside of them being awfully shallow as characters and merely existing to pander to specific parts of the audience as overdone archetypical tools that are in nearly any JRPG ever, they are supposed to exist to make Issei feel comparatively inferior. In fact, in the last episode, Issei talks about how he lacks the strength, healing ability, magical ability, or swordfighting skills while fighting the obligatory final boss of the season- Does this all matter? No. He has the most powerful weapon shown in the series so far, so why is this relevant? What was the point of making him seem \"inferior\" to others when all he has to do is do the typical resolve speech and it will make him just instantly more powerful than everyone else? \\n\\n\r\nLet's put that in this context and see if that sounds any less ridiculous:\\n\r\n\"I may not have a bamboo stick, boxing gloves, or a first-aid kit, but I have a rifle that I can shoot you with.\"\\n\\n\r\nNo, it still sounds dumb as shit. I also liked that chess analogy that the show kept bringing it up, though. It's almost like it's just there for the sake of being pretentious. And it is. \\n\\n\r\nAs for Rias, she's just bland as any other character in this show. She even goes on a speech about how she wants to be seen as Rias/herself and not be carried by her family name and nobility- Huh, that sounds awfully familiar. Oh, that's right- That's every Disney princess speech about how they're so perfect that it's bad. Outside of that, she falls in love with Issei because he's the main character and also because her fiancee conveniently happens to be a pretty huge dick like again, every Disney princess plot. While I'm not looking for super originality here, it's pretty bad if you're ripping off the fucking Disney routine.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, it doesn't help considering the second half of the show involves this Disney princess routine being played out for too many episodes while the first half involves this clearly not evil girl suddenly calling Issei out on a date only to show her true evil nature in the same episode. The asinine pacing can be further shown by how Issei goes on later about how he truly cared about this girl he met for less than a day and how he's sad to realize that she was evil all along. Am I supposed to feel sad here? Later, Issei meets this other random girl, who he also met for less than a day, and later on she gets captured by the aforementioned evil girl, and then she experiences a horrible Disney death on a techno-cross. Good thing Rias can resurrect dead people, so that didn't matter in the end. The great part is that there was supposed to be this time limit about saving her before it was too late, but that turned out to be totally irrelevant too. Way to build tension and break it in the same episode. Trivialize an already inconsequential death of a girl that the MC has met for less than a day is truly the best way to invoke emotions.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other elements of the show, the music is pretty generic, but not painful to listen to. The animation is also incredibly average, which is about what you'd expect from a show of this genre. Though if I had to point out a flaw, it would be that the character designs were just really generic. If you can't give your characters any depth, at least make them look interesting. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show is bad. Shallow characters, annoying main character, irrelevant consequences (including how the MC \"sacrificed\" his arm for a power up, which was completely inconsequential), lack of an actual antagonist with an actual motive, and just overall being boring. It's downright offensive. The pacing was all over the place, and including quarter of the show with fillers is probably the most retarded idea one could come up with. \\n\\n\r\nFrankly, for the longest time, I've been wondering why these harem shows were mostly awful. Maybe it's the overwhelming amount of pandering shoved into my face that is causing me to not enjoy these shows very much. Maybe. But more than likely it's just because they're fucking terrible. I tried to watch this all the way through while ignoring all the pandering so that maybe I could appreciate the hidden depth within. Or the lack thereof. \\n\\n\r\nIt didn't turn out well after all. Let's not try that again. And neither should you.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "High School DxD is an anime that has been praised as the best ecchi ever made, and in a way that is accurate. Seriously though, it is an ecchi. For all of you ecchi haters, stay away. Shove down your masochistic tendencies and walk away, this is not an anime you are going to enjoy. \r\nWe all know what we are getting into when we turn this show on, copious amounts of T&A. High School DxD has quickly become synonymous with that phrase. But even then, that was not the sole reason I turned this show on. I generally am the type that needs abit more than titillating imagery to watch something. So when I heard that DxD also had this really cool story to accompany it, I was sold. Allow me to inform you that I can in good conscience say I feel betrayed...\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\n*SIGH* \\n\r\nBefore going into the specifics of the story that follows the characters, let me say that the overall concept of this world is what truly piqued my interest in the show. A three way war between Devils, Angels, and Fallen Angels. An expansive world with history behind it. Varying degrees of mythology from different countries. Sadly, these aspects are quickly overshadowed by the story surrounding the main character. \\n\r\nHigh School setting? Expected. It's in the bloody title. But what I wasn't expecting was a poor story about a servant and his literal power-ups. The story wants to be serious, but fails miserably at it. The so called \"emotional\" moments had me rolling my eyes, and the dialogue left me stunned from how many cliche Shounen lines it had. \\n\r\nI am attempting to avoid spoilers, which is why I am avoiding the specifics that made this story as bad as it was. Just know this, it is a cool concept that loses points due to the execution. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nIt was good and filled to the brim with boobs and panty-shots. I don't know what else I can really say. It was nothing spectacular, but is by no means un-watchable. Standard fare for when it was released. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe OST was pretty solid. The music did a surprisingly good job of adding to the scenes. \\n\r\nThe standout aspect of the sound for me was actually the voice acting. I watched the show dubbed, but I have seen enough of the subbed to know that both are good. But in my opinion, watch the show dubbed. The voices may actually be more fitting in the subbed, personal preference really. But the dub has dialogue that adds to the hilarity of the scenes exponentially. When the MC can \"promise not to drain his pimp-juice\", it's a damn fine dub.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nIssei- An extremely typical pervert. I really, really disliked Issei. He is literally an idiot, and every single one of his thoughts revolves around something lewd. Of course he is also a decent guy with a heart of gold, but hey, that's just par for the course. He is established early on as a good hearted pervert, and he remains a good hearted pervert until the end. He does gain a bit of development, but it really is just a bit. \\n\\n\r\nRias Gremory- Here we have the gorgeous, devil senpai you read about in the description. A surprisingly decent character. She is strong willed, honest, and oddly compassionate. Peculiar for a devil, but this show does break the occasional trope. What I liked about her character was how she took everything for what it was. Fully acknowledging and accepting Issei's perversion, and using it as a motivation. She doesn't care what other people think, and does as she wishes. \\n\\n\r\nAsia- Rarely have I found a more stereotypical \"nice girl\". She is incredibly sweet to everyone, a bit naive and innocent, and completely incapable of defending herself. Did I mention she's a nun that falls for the main character instantly. I didn't dislike Asia, but I found it hard to like her as she hardly felt like a character. She was immediately filed into my brain as a ball of cliches, and I felt nothing for her because of that. \\n\\n\r\nThe notable side characters are Akeno, Kiba, and Koneko. The busty sadist with a kind exterior, the respectful pretty boy, and the expressionless loli with a love for sweets, respectively. I was a big fan of these characters, and really wanted to see more of them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5 \\n\r\nThere are a few things to enjoy about this anime, maybe you enjoy the comedy, the action, or the titillating imagery. For me, the comedy was hit or miss. Some jokes I loved, others I hated. The ones I hated usually pertained to Issei's perversion, it is such an overused concept that I don't even crack a smile. The comedy I loved was mostly in regards to the dialogue, definitely my favorite part. \\n\r\nI really liked the action. Especially in the later episodes, I felt genuinely invested in what was happening. The action was accompanied by serious tones without being emotional tones, and they were pretty well done. \\n\r\nThe massive amounts of fan-service in this show really didn't do much on the enjoyment factor either. It doesn't lose any points, but boobs and panty-shots alone don't do anything. I suppose if you pause during one of Issei's fantasies you could pitch a tent, but it didn't do much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nBy that score alone, you may think it isn't worth watching. A passable story with some decent characters and good dialogue, seems like it isn't worth your time. But for all of you ecchi fans, and for those who can at least tolerate ecchi, this is worth watching. Why? Because it gets better. The first season of High School DxD really isn't that good, but the second season is good, and you can expect it to improve from there. Being knowledgeable about the original source material, many of the flaws in this anime will be fixed. The story will improve, characters will develop, it will become a good fantasy story. \\n\r\nOne aspect of High School DxD that I applaud the creator for is his honesty in regards to fan-service. He makes the fan-service a plot point by truly involving it in the MC's drives (and later abilities). He gives the fan-service a plausible reason for existing considering the amoral nature of the devils. The author embraces fan-service, which is a unique aspect I award credit for. \\n\\n\r\nHigh School DxD is an ecchi that develops into a good story. Anyone who tries to pass this first season off as the best ecchi ever is just lying to you. But it is worth watching just to see what comes later.",

            "content": "High School DxD is based on the light novels written by Ichiei Ishibumi and illustrated by Miyama-Zero. It stands out from the other ecchi harems that I have seen in sense that the first season cannot really be considered a harem but rather Issei going after the female love interest Rias Gremory. Some of the other female characters do show interest such as Asia when Issei becomes more intimate with the other girls. But the real harem aspects of High School DxD show up in the second season. If you are a fan of the ecchi genre you will be pleased to hear that DxDhas plenty of perverted panty shots and uncensored boobs. I went into it not knowing what to expect, and surprisingly it has exceeded the relatively low expectations I had for it. \\n\\n\r\nHigh School DxD falls into the \"it's good for what it is\" category and does not try to be something it is not. This is why it should be viewed as first and foremost a fan service show. With some laugh out loud moments, senseless antics and occasional dramatic tones in the overarching plot. This is what makes it stand out from most other ecchi\u2019s that resort to covering an unintelligible story with lots of fan service. High School DxD has an actual story and distinctive character development. With the fan service aside the show actually does have its merits. I particularly like the art style, decent visuals, and the music score.  \\n\\n\r\nHigh School DxD gives you a lot of variety in the female characters as well as the situations they get undressed. The girls of the Occult Research Club range from Koneko, a very petite and small breasted girl who displays a lack of emotion and seems rather unaffected by everything. To Akeno who is busty and seems to take some enjoyment from Issei\u2019s antics. As well as the voluptuous Rias with Asia more on the petite side. All of the female characters are sexy and attractive in different ways. \\n\\n\r\nHigh School DxD is all about mindless fun with a respectable amount of T&A. Evaluate it as a fan service focused series; it delivers on what it is, an ecchi harem comedy with an angels versus devils versus fallen angles aspect (This can get pretty confusing and doesn't make sense at times). It is a little better than average and one of the top recent series in its genre. Don\u2019t go into watching this with the wrong mentality expecting it to be something it is not. You will be disappointed, watch it for what it is and you may find enough enjoyment to keep watching. I would recommend it to anyone new to ecchi and if this sounds interesting to anyone they should definitely check it out.  \\n\r\nOverall=7          \\n",

            "content": "Being a massive fan of the DxD series, I absolutely loved the anime adaptation. Anyone who has read the light novels would realise just how much emotional depth all the characters go through, especially Issei (the main protagonist) who I can only say had a VERY traumatic first girlfriend experience. High School DxD has a new take to a harem story, the author guaranteed a happy ending for all the girls and the plot is getting results that show it unlike other harem stories which can just end up a pain in the neck as the main protagonist is unable to choose.\r\nFirst of all, youcan immediately see the amazing art of the anime which can live up / match on par to the beautiful character designs that Miyama-Zero created. This of course closely ties into the effects used in the animation which were pretty much spot on to how i imagined them to be, especially in the battle scenes.\\n\\n\r\nYou hear a lot of people complain about this series being \"too ecchi\" and put you off from watching but you'll just be missing out. This series was made with ecchi in mind but not to the degree of other series such as To Love Ru or Sekirei; they're pretty much several times worse in terms of ecchi level. However, I will say that the anime did add more fanservice and nude scenes than the original novel which many may think as a way to get views and sales. I myself am glad they did, not because there's more ecchi scenes to see but because it increases the chances of another season. The reason why im hoping for more of the anime is because the best parts of the story are towards to latter half of the light novel volumes and I would like to see it animated. The extra fanservice was doen in good taste and suited the pace of the story so it can be overlooked.\\n\r\nThis might be seen as hateful to do but the fact is that it wasnt done in a hateful manner; they didnt censor the all the scenes like the Majikoi anime where it pretty much forces you to buy the uncensored DVD / Blu-Ray releases.\\n\\n\r\nFor anyone who thinks that there is little character development, I can now inform you that a second season is going into production and I guarantee that you wont be disappointed with the new characters that are going to appear. Every character has a part of themselves that is kept hidden past but the troubles are overcome through the friendship and relationship amongst the group. \\n\r\n*Small spoiler* For the more battle loving fans, Issei's predetermined external rival will arrive soon\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there were some unnecessary parts included to buff out the anime, namely by including some of the short stories, the anime remained rather faithful towards the original story. In reality, it would have been better if they spent more time on the main plot to include more details and make the short stories into OVAs. \\n\r\nOf course, they didnt miss out some infamous lines where the most memorable one appears in episode 12 of the anime. It would have been preposterous for them to have missed out that one.\\n\\n\r\nI know that this review may have strayed from just talking about this season of this anime and I apologise for that however, I needed to bring in other factors in hope that all you out there give this a shot and persuade you to watch it as the foundation to the greatness that is to follow. Reviewing DxD in such constricted context does not bring it justice. \\n\\n\r\nOn a final note, don't watch this with females unless you know they're alright with an ecchi series...They're only going to get jealous with the beautiful female characters",

Character - 7\\n\\n\r\nUPDATED: The plot of the show has progressed in such a manner that there are now a more clear idea of a general enemy(s) and task(s) that the Gremory Clan must vanquish/complete. The plot in itself has actually surprised me, in a good way, from what I would expect from this sub-genre. overall its done enough to pull itself clear from medicore to above average. - 7~7.5\\n\\n\r\nThe combination of classical and more modern music sets a nice, and appropriate, background theme for the series. The voice actors/actresses, for the most part, seem to fit the roles well. **Although I'm not a huge fan of the OP the ED is rather enjoyable - 8\\n\\n\r\nWhile the art, while nothing spectacular, did manage to get in a few nice transformation sequences, and it appears that they budgeted appropriately for the action sequences, something That I was rather happy and surprised to see after last season Itsuka Tenma.  - 7 (down from 8 due to some lesser quality sequences, although with BDs it could go as high as 9)\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is worth a watch, especially with so little on the table this season. While not fantastic in any one department it does its job well enough that, at least for me, I was entertained throughout. Overall - 7 /10\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE: I'm very on the fence about this score now to me the show has managed to prove that it can seperate itself from the pack, But I don't quite feel it deserves an 8 yet, as such my overall grade is a 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nnext update to come when the series ends, pending anything GLORIOUS or horrendous.",

            "content": "Oppai, man we aaaall love oppai, they're round, good lookin, have a nipple in the middle. Man, but what about big oppai? Maybe oppai every single episode? Welp you got it! And thats Highschool DxD for ya, oppai or in english term, tits,boobs,melons,bozangas,milk-makers, I COULD GO ON ALL DAY. This show is a pretty weird example of fanservice, you got it everywhere! Hell some episodes nearly feel like filler episodes till the end of the episodes that continue the story. I came out of this show with no pants and a wet dick, but for now lets get to the review. Shall we?\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nSo westart off with Issei, a typical pervert who peeks on girls with his pals at high-school. One day he meets this girl and goes out on a date with her, and well Issei gets killed by this bi- I mean girl and she turns out to be a, \"fallen angel\" DUN DUN DUUUUUN! So in Issei's final seconds he thinks about a girl called Rias who he saw earlier ago, and he ends up summoning her cause she's a demon! DUN DUUUUUUUUN. And this is where our adventure begins. This story goes on till episode 6 with filler, fanservice and the plot is kind of messy at times and hell at times I was wondering, \"Am I watching anime, or softcore hentai?\" Theres many oppais and a lot of shit going on, you just get confused. One moment Issei progesses the story by learning something another second he's being a pervert and theres oppais everywhere.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nTheres not much to say about the art, it dosen't look half bad, the colours look nice, the animation is smooth. Overall its ok, not much to say but it fits the show. A little more detail can be put in but its ok, overall.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nFor a show filled with fanservice, the music is really well done! The opening is a very nice and calm tune showing you what to expect in this show. The ending is this great and upbeat tune kind of like you're watching a play and you're about to leave and they put this Up beat song, this is probably what it would be. Songs go from slow and beautiful tones to Epic and Mighty tunes pumping up your heart! The sound quality is overall well done and good as hell.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nThere are 3 main characters that we are focused on. First you got Issei, typical pervert, At times I like Issei at times I hate him, he usually does everything wrong that just makes me wanna kick his ass until he realizes he's an idiot. At times he could actually be pretty humurous and make some ol'jokes. Then you got Rias, she's a pretty good character, she usually does whats best for Issei and sure she only changes a bit in the end of the series but you just can't help but like  her. Then you got Asia, your cliched character who falls in love with the MC, will get jealous if someone trys to do anything romantic with him and the usual cliches. Her backstory is pretty explainable itself but she's too generic. The character developements aren't really strong and feel meh, like they aren't trying.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nWithout the humor, fanservice, filler and oppai this show would be pretty boring, so I give props for that stuff being there, overall this show will hook you from the start and you'll probably watch it till the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7//10\\n\r\nThis show is enjoyable and pretty good overall. I have no problem with fanservice so I was able to watch this at ease. If you have a problem with fanservice or overall hate it. Stay from this show like its poop. If not you'll easily enjoy this show, if you go through this show without fapping once, you're tough enough to be in the weenies club. Cause theres a LOT of fappable content, so make sure you have some lotion ready before watching this.",

At the end of watching you will feel like its a normal anime but not at the same time because of the nudity. \r\nEND you can stop readingnow.... just go watch and rate the review if you find it helpful and please watch at least 5ep before dropping it #justsaying. \\n\\n\r\nOther Notes :\\n\\n\r\nthe main character is quite well thought out and he actually works to prove his worth and make's girls fall for him him that I can say is what a harem anime should be. Guys proving themselves it makes more scenes that way \\n\\n\r\nother then that Sound,art are great too. nude scenes are well shown with good reason (most of the time) \\n\r\nmost are due to fights but not just because they need to add fan services but it does add the realistically to the show\\n\r\nother reason well... you'll just have to watch..\\n\\n\r\nif you are still here you must like to read. \\n\r\nif you like please message me if you find it of help or you can share your thoughts about the review. \\n\\n\r\nthoughts , \\n\r\nI really like this show and it has proven that anime is not just about boobs \\n\r\nwish there where more shows like this imagine one piece or bleach had clothes ripping apart haha \\n\r\njust kidding though but would like to see a long anime with that.. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nBoth film and television have a great number of genres and sub-genres. Some of these sub-genres are quite easy to pull off, like the \"jump scare\" adolescent horror movies that Blumhouse shits out every year! All you have to do is follow the same cookie cutter formula and your low budget schlock film will make back at least 800% of its budget and receive decent reviews! One of the most difficult sub-genres to actually execute well is the \"completely self aware, so bad it's good comedy\". Many studios and directors attempt to tackle this sub-genre with films like \"Sharknado\" or \"Snakes on a Plane\" butalmost ALWAYS the result ends up being boring and predictable instead of actually funny and amusing. Anime studios have also recently entered into this sub-genre with shows like High School of the Dead, but  High school DxD largely succeeds where High school of the Dead fell flat on its face. DxD remembers to NEVER take itself seriously and most importantly to keep its jokes and line delivery actually funny! \\n\\n\r\nPlot:\\n\\n\r\nDo you like boobs? Do you like lots of blood? Do you like not being bothered with such cumbersome inconveniences as character development or a well written plot? This is the show for you! DxD is a story about a pervert that joins a largely female school to try gain his own harem. Instead he remains a virgin and a social pariah until the power of his bullshit \"MacGuffin\" forces him to choose a side in a faction war between Demons, Angels, and Fallen Angels. The Demon faction are different from the fallen angels and were not created by Jehovah unlike the Angels and Fallen Angels. In the beginning of time, several powerful races came into being including Gods (of whom Jehovah is one of many), the demons, and the dragons. Jehovah/Allah unlike his brothers Zeus and Odin decided to try wipe out the Demons and created the Angels as his personal army. However, some of the angels were immoral and slept with human women, so Jehovah/Allah cast them out and they became the Fallen Angels or \"Grigori\". The fallen Angels tried to exterminate the Demons in order to win back Jehovah's favor, but Jehovah decided to declare war on both factions and start a 3 way war. This war devastated the ranks of the 3 armies and killed both Jehovah and the 4 original Demon Kings called \"Satans\". To the present day an uneasy truce has been kept between the surviving members of these factions. The plot in addition to absurd comedy, shameless fanservice, and slapstick serves as a giant FUCK YOU to religion and insults every religion in equal measure. It's almost as if Bill Maher wrote this series...only its too funny for him to have been the author. DxD frequently references other anime and is VERY aware of all the tropes it is using including ripping off DBZ and perpetually name dropping obscure demons, angels, and other kaballah related terms as a middle finger to Evangelion's admittedly insufferable use of this technique.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters from the main male protagonist Issei to the female protagonist Rias are very cardboard archetypes. The series doesn't take itself seriously and never actually tries to develop these characters because the entire point of the series is to be enjoyably idiotic bullshit. This was actually the right move for DxD because it becomes very annoying when a REALLY stupid series actually tries to take itself seriously and demands that the viewer respect its dignity. I'm looking at you Seikon no Qwasar!\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound:\\n\\n\r\nThe art predictably features absurdly large breasts that move in ways that completely fuck the laws of physics. However, unlike Maoyuu Yuusha, which has similar breasts and then suddenly demands that the viewer put on a sophisticated cap and discuss theories of agricultural distribution, DxD KNOWS how stupid its breasts are and revels in it! The English dub is actually excellent and the soundtrack is decent. Overall, surprisingly not bad from a purely technical view.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nHigh School DxD is NOT a good anime by any means. However, it knows exactly how to be that special type of bad that is still for some reason amusing. You will grin like the Cheshire Cat while watching a train wreck in slow motion! I'm not saying I actually recommend this series, but if you want echii bullshit you could do WAY worse! At least this series is WAY better than Food Wars!",

            "content": "If you are no fan of the ecchi genre, please exit this review and spend your time on other reviews. I've been hearing adults say that the arts nowadays are not really emphasised. Well, I beg to differ. Body art is an aspect of art in which many people are spending time in. Animes also have quite a decent amount of genre with the aspect of body art a.k.a ecchi genres. Of course, this anime too. Read the synopsis your own as I'm diving straight through into the review.\r\nStory:\r\n  THIS ISN'T PORN! It's just ecchi. All of my friends were like OMG! YOU WATCHPORN! Come on. It's categorised as ecchi not hentai. You might think I'm lying but this anime honestly has a good plot. Many of my friends were like: Yeah you watch this anime for the \"plot\". Seriously, if you were to watch this anime without labelling it, it actually has an impressive and interesting plot. First Issei gets reborn as a devil. Few episodes dedicated to introduce other characters and for character development purposes. Towards the end of the anime was the most exciting part of this anime. The Rating Game. Really really cool. During that time my heart gets pumping so vigorously that I can feel its sheer impact. Again, it's the plot that made my heart pump so hard, rarely to do with the body art.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n  Nothing much to comment about the art. Quite decently done for a 2012 anime. Really beautiful and impressive art I should say.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n  Not a main aspect of this anime in my opinion. However, I do agree that the Opening song was very catchy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n  A very important aspect of this anime. Issei(MC)- pervertic and oh that's all. He's always thinking about oppai no matter what. Be it when everyone is in danger or when everyone is taking a rest. Anytime and anywhere. Rias-a high-ranking devil. Nothing much to talk about except for the fact that she's really beautiful and powerful. Akeno- hehehe. I challenge you to not wiki her when watching the anime. Quite an interesting and unexpected character. Asia- she should just buzz off. Ugly, annoying, extra and weak. Can practically do nothing much. Kiba- nothing much to comment on. Koneko-I would term her as a silent killer. Watch to find out why I call her that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n  With a fairly decent and interesting plot topped with the aspect of body art, How could one agree that this anime is lousy and boring? Really, trust me. This anime has indeed a very interesting plot especially towards the end where they played The Rating Game. I would say I really enjoyed this anime. Please do not watch this in front of your parents as they might just label this as porn. Alternatively, you could agree that you are pursuing your passion for body art since people nowadays are more likely to be pursuing something that would pay them well. I think you could more or less get away with it.\\n\\n\r\nThank you",

            "content": "Every once in a while an anime comes around that is so well done you have an eyegasm after every episode, simply put a masterpiece......\r\nyeah, this isn't really that anime.\r\nFrom personal observations I've noticed that people who can't stand fanservice shoot down an anime because of fanservice. I find them to be more annoying and painful than bamboo splinters under my fingernails. I dont really understand why they keep watching, if thats the type of anime they hate with a passion, then why? Are they masochists? Are they closet pervs who just don't want to admit it? The fact of the matter is that ifyou're against it this anime isn't for you, no need to keep reading. If you don't like ecchi, dont watch it!\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the actual review.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad\\n\r\n-the main issue with harems is the character development, this be no exception. The main character is the stereotypical average student with a now common \"want to protect\" mindset. I didn't really see much character development, however I, from my view point, did see some (I mentioning feel explaining would spoil) but I can't truly knock it down too much, unlike if it was to be a series with much more time in which i would have been pissed. \\n\r\n-I found the plot to be nothing really special and has a set up that I feel I've seen before.\\n\r\n-The plot did have its holes and unanswered questions by the end, with only a temporary resolution yet its not that big of an issue because they were things that could easily be answered in the second season, unless they explain fuck all in the next season, at which time i will pray the director's crab's get herpies.\\n\r\n-The setting, you guest it, a highschool, i need not go on.\\n\r\n-The animation was really nothing exceptional there is very much a lack of eyegasm in this sense as nothing really pops out at you except boobs and someone's boner if not your own.\\n\r\n-The music didn't leave ear bleeding, but was only slightly above good.\\n\r\n-I will say it. At times, the ecchi does get very excessive however I don't qualify that as an excuse to throw this in the crap pile, its not really that unbearable.\\n\\n\r\nThe good\\n\r\n-to redeem the setting itself, it did have some diversity because even though the title of the anime is high school dxd, i found the situations to have nearly nothing to do with high school. There is the clubhouse but they normally just meet and move elsewhere from there. I just found it to be more of a building/base than an average school. \\n\r\n-The comedy (probably a bit bias here) was the type I find funny, I am very much the type to appreciate a sexual joke, don't give a dam if Im called a perv at least I dont hide it, but there are some other mixed in. \\n\r\n-Idk if accel world  made me realize this but I did notice that the chicks in this anime don't just magically fall in love with him left and right, which I find to be preferable. The ones that do fall for him are ones that have a reason to after some connection between them and it doesnt happen with every fucking girl.\\n\r\n-There were some action scenes that coming into the fight gave me chills and that \"shits about to go down\" feeling we all love.\\n\\n\r\nThe unexplainable\\n\r\nFrom everything gathered it would be guessed that this is just a regular anime with not much to offer as with average animation, sound, plot, ext. However, the fact of the matter is this anime is on my favorites list to this day. Why? its obvious I'm aware of its flaws, then why? truthfully I can't explain it.\\n\r\nLooking at it from a reviewer's perspective this is just an average anime. \\n\r\nYet, looking at it from an average viewer who values enjoyment value above all else, I truly loved it. Idk maybe its just im more indecisive than Romney, but I found it to be enjoyable as fuck. This anime just has that \"guilty pleasure\" feel. Its the kind of weird shit that if people were to come into my room I would switch to porn, because that is just so much easier to explain. So many people I know bash its flaws, yet can't wait for a second season. I went through this shit in a siting and was glad I did.\\n\\n\r\nThe verdict\\n\r\nOverall I give this anime a rating of guilty pleasure that through its flaws is just inexplicably addictive.\\n\r\nI recommend (unless ur allergic to boobs and ass and life)",

            "content": "With such series' like Rosario Vampire and Aki-Sora, the ecchi and harem genre has never been stronger. It is with such series going around that the genre being what it is that makes High School DxD an instant hit for fans of the genre. On the surface, it's an over-the-top, high-paced, fan-serviced spectacle that many fans of this genre love. With its rather cliche plot and possibly even more cliche characters, it'll capture you granted that you don't mind tits and asses.\r\nStorywise, it starts out slow. The build-up is slow and the way the overall premise is established is slightly faster, but still very muchslow. The story goes through two arcs in the first season. Possibly one of the highlights is the insults of the writing. Yes, I definitely think that the insults and the multiple ways of calling a person a douche and even the multiple terms for wanting to have sex with someone. Granted, sometimes the writing interferes with the story, but as I stated, the story itself is a bit cliche, but it catches on and somehow you'll find yourself being drawn to it.\\n\\n\r\nI think one of the most impressive things about this series is the art style. It's with the art that one is drawn to an anime or manga first. We look with our eyes before we read and delve into the universe presented to us in the visual form. The fluid animation brings an added bonus to the art itself. It just might be the best thing about the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe musical score and other such sound effects really brought the series to life. With a brilliant composer such as Ryosuke Nakanishi, it's hard not to just fall deeply in love with the music. I will admit that at times it slightly felt out of place, but that's only in the smallest of ways. \\n\\n\r\nAs stated beforehand, the characters took a while to build and some of them had cliche moments, but there definitely was a good amount of heart put forth into them. As much as the series is fan service, the characters showed surprising development in the twelve episodes. That's not to say that there weren't moments where I had my doubts \u2014 cause there were. There were even some characters that I felt that could have been left out. Hell, there were even some characters that I felt were wasted opportunities. Still, with that being said, I felt the main characters, at least, were handled well.\\n\\n\r\nSo, overall the series is good for those who like harem, ecchi, laugh-out-loud moments, and over-the-top action that makes one question their sanity. It's a good time and the heart is there. My final score is 7/10.",

            "content": "Alright,my review is short as usual but I will conclude my own perception about this anime. If you are the fans of ecchi based or harem based anime,here is the must watch series for you.\r\nStoryline: (8/10)\r\nStoryline is pretty straight forward.As usual the story starts with a single hint and then a flashback of story.But I think its not necessary. I will not touch to the sypnosis here but, from the first ep, you will found out what the story main theme. There is girls battle with magic in a school life environment, some sort of hidden power on the main lead character, and a littlebit of harem blended with uncensored ecchi(some).\\n\\n\r\nArt: (8/10)\\n\r\nAnime art is pretty good for me. If you have watch recents released anime series or last season series, its almost the same. Not much to comment about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:(8/10)\\n\r\nThe main lead is totally weak,brainless and weak( maybe he will be storng after awakened). Its normal for harem/ ecchi based anime, the main character usually weak but in some sort of condition,He will be the hero of the story. Hehe...\\n\r\nI'm not going to touch about the girls since the first ep did not shows a lot about them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThe main enjoyment is mostly on the ecchi and harem theme of the anime. Not the main storyline....nahhh most of you will think (I watch this anime not because the storyline but the anime ecchiness and of course I am harem lover)\\n\r\nFor me, the storyline is pretty good when packed with this kind of elements.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nThis anime concludes most of attractive elements such as ecchi,harem,school life,magic,battle or maybe shounen and nudity. So, I think you should watch this show, dont take it serieously, this anime would be watch for fun and makes me feel relaxes after some serious show.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: This was the first anime I ever watched, so I probably enjoyed it more than the average anime lover :3\r\nThis anime is good, great, fantastic! It's full of hilarious moments, badass action scenes, and an admirable try-hard main character. When I watched High School DxD, the fantasy really stood out for me (although I didn't have any other anime to compare it to at the time). The magic circles, giant dragons, explosions and amazing super powers that made the eyes drool (metaphorically), it was truly a great start to my life as an otaku. \r\nLooking back, the story and character development was pretty weak,but that's besides the point. I didn't watch it for the story and characters. I enjoyed the art, I loved Issei's perverted antics and the priceless looks on his face when anything lewd happened. It made for a hilarious watching and that is why I have rated my enjoyment so high. Considering I had never before seen a show about a perverted boy and giant boobs (and small boobs for that matter), this show felt fresh, daring and exciting and it had me at the edge of my seat gawping and thinking 'DID THAT REALLY JUST HAPPEN???'. \\n\\n\r\nAnother point is the random, and often too plentiful changes in mood that the show went through. Halfway through fights which are supposed to be serious and cool, are interjected by sexual jokes and slapstick comedy. Depending on what you like, it's either a blessing or a reason to not watch the show. Although I would say this show is mainly a comedy so expect silliness galore! \\n\\n\r\nFinally, I must warn you of the amount of fanservice this show contains (For those of you unsure what I mean, there are boobs everywhere, and quite often the inappropriate panty shot. (Those Japanese... *sighs*) If you're not into it, then you will probably find this show difficult to watch. But, if you're an avid anime fan, you're probably used to it so you shouldn't mind. And remember, this show is ecchi - not hentai. There is no sex in this show! \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I loved the show. It is a great laugh and has great fantasy elements! The OP and ED songs are very enjoyable and as a whole, I highly recommend High School DxD to those who like magic and high school boy shows (and aren't too put off by the fanservice). I hope this review helped you a little bit! (\u1551\u15e2\u0942\u14eb\u2217)",

Oh, and I kinda like the way the school uniform for girls was drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fair 6 . Boink! Boink!\\n\\n\r\nI just like the opening theme, that's all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Poor 3. Boink ! Boink!\\n\\n\r\nLet's to each of the protagonist of this anime:\\n\\n\r\nIssei Hoyodo- I don't like the way where he's typecast a a stupid character who doesn't know what he has and what he can do and all he has in his mind is porn, I don't quite understand as to why a fallen angel would go after him if he can be used to fight off demons since he's a sacred gear holder. Frankly everything that happens to this character is too easy so much so that any spunk in his character is lost and replaced with disgust pertaining to his stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nRias Gremory- She's  demon with linage, which should be reserve for vampires, ok so she the big boss of her posse and she's in love with the stupid Issei..... too easy for her role as a demon with class, it's obvious that the author is simply banking on her fanservice and nothing more. \\n\\n\r\nAsia Argento- She's also on the same boat as Rias except she a much sweeter character, again her romance with Issei is too easy and it's her fansrevice that makes up for her character. \\n\\n\r\nHimejima Akeno- she being a half fallen angel half demon don't seem to add up as being one of Rias' posse, in fact she more of a tease in this anime than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nKiba Yuuto- he's more like an extra and nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nToujo Koneko- ok so she's the the team's muscle and more like a flat chested fanservice type.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what we have are a bunch of demons whose capability is a mismatch as to what is expected of the usual demon thing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: Fair 6. Boink! Boink! Boink! Boink!\\n\\n\r\nI could have given this anime a poor rating, but I've thought that since there are a couple of laughs that comes with this anime and a lot of fanservice, I guess that the poor story can be brush aside and just focus on the guys stupidity which is both disgusting and funny and the girls' fanservice, definitely not for guys who expects a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe End. Boink! Boink! (.)(.)\\n",

            "content": "Sex, lewd thoughts, and imaginations. Here's an interesting little trivia: Did you know that the average man in our world today think about sex nearly every 56 seconds? Fact or fiction, you decide. Of course, this is all normal. I mean, our minds is filled with all sorts of imaginations and dreams whether it'd be finding the perfect girlfriend or going on your first dream date. In this anime known as the High School DxD, our protagonist Hyudo Iseei goes from a lecherous second-year high school student attending Kuoh Academy to someone he hasn't began to imagine before.\r\nAt first glance, the title High School DxDdoesn't really stand out much. The first two words \u201chigh school\u201d is probably a place most of us made good (or bad memories) in our lives. Of course, Issei hopes to make good memories because the school has recently turned into co-ed from a former girls-only school. And where else would a healthy boy at his puberty stage wants to make most of it? High school of course. But not all is easy as he is known to be creepy at the academy. With few \u201creal\u201d friends, the chances of making his goal of high school memories is becoming slim.\\n\\n\r\nThat of course later changes when the unthinkable happens and he is killed by his very first girlfriend. Talk about bad luck, I can only think of one person off my head right now with the Imagine Breaker with that sort of luck. But is this really bad luck? Because the most beautiful and respected character of the school and series takes attention of him...\\n\\n\r\nFirst, we have the beautiful Rias Gremory. She is someone everyone admires and lusts about. She is the president of the Occult Club. And she is of course, the main heroine as well as one of the reasons some of us are watching this series for the lulz. She takes a curious interest in our protagonist Issei after the incident but what really makes her unique is her definite character. Behind her outer shell is a girl who takes responsibility and does what she does best: helping others. These traits seem to pass onto Issei for despite his creepiness around the academy, he is known to be helpful and hardworking.\\n\\n\r\nThen, we have some of the other characters. The sadistic Akeno who is also admired among the academy. Playful and flirtatious, she plays the role of the one-sama whom a lot of us wants to be \u201ctreated\u201d by her. Then, we have our mascot, the all adorable loli Koneko-chan. Behind that cute loli apperance lies a girl of power and valor who puts her own life at risk to help others. Next, we have Asia-san, the pure girl that reflects the innocence of the series after all the lewd story arcs and peerage. Finally, we have Kiba who serves as the antithesis of Issei, whom he despises to no end. And of course, all these characters of the Occult Club are the bridge to Issei's path of becoming someone who he never thought he'd be.\\n\\n\r\nBy this point, some of you reading this review are probably thinking \u201cgod damn it, not another harem\u201d or \u201cfan-service...what else is new?\u201d And of course, I agree there. Fan-service is nothing new but a device used to attract viewers. So, if you can't take the boobs, ass, and nudity, then feel free to watch another series. If you have a serious issue with the uncensored scenes and fan-service, then just drop the damn series as no one is forcing you to watch. However, if you can take it like a true anime fan, then kudos to you as you will be proud once you complete perhaps the ecchiest (if that's even a word) series of this year 2012.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this series is just meh for me. I didn't take much notice of it as most people are probably paying attention more to the action and fan-service than art when watching this. I don't blame you, I mean who could take their eyes off one second of that million dollar body of Rias Gremory? :) Then, of course, the sound. I do admit that it does mixes in well especially in later episodes where the seriousness conveys the more dramatic visage of the story. It's not as powerful as Yuki Kajiura's soundtracks from Mai-Hime or Tsubusa Chronicles but still all in all, it does fit well once you listen to it carefully.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being labelled as a ecchi and even harem on MAL, this series does have a storyline. Yes, can you believe it? An actual ecchi anime with a decent storyline! As such in series like this, you can expect the master and slave relationship. One catch though. This time, the girl is the master. Some of the viewers watching this may now think about the typical \u201cmaster/slave\u201d fantasies or \u201cking's game\u201d from your heads now. However, behind the scenes of the fan-service and nudity lies a story where a young boy goes from zero to hero. The storyline gets deeper in the light novels but the anime isn't all too shabby. It starts off as a predictable opening, goes to a more emotional setting, and then goes out with a bang. A literal bang thanks to what Issei learns and became throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nSo, you're probably asking yourself now: \u201cshould I watch this?\u201d Honestly, that's an ambigious question. When God gave us brains, we all have different views on everything like anime, manga, life, appearances, etc. However, if you just watched the trailer or first 5 mins of the series and decided to hit that drop button, then I feel really sorry for you. Why? Because this series is more than just about ecchi and fan-service. It has potential. It has emotion. It has drama. It has interest.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have serious problems with watching this anime, then maybe think about your High School memories. I bet Issei's virginity that the memories of your High School years won't be that much better than this series. (well, at least for me)",

            "content": "Surprisingly, despite this being labeled as \"harem,\" this show didn't feel much like harem to me. Really strange. In fact, Sword Art Online felt even more of a harem than this, but ok. Issei only had like one real love interest, and that was Rias. Maybe it's the perspective of socially awkward people who think that if a girl talks to a guy, that means that the girl is in love with the guy that makes them think this is a harem. So I guess harem now means having a bunch of female characters and having one relevant male character in a same show. Oh,and I guess the main character constantly went on about how he likes harem or something. But I'm pretty sure that doesn't qualify a show as harem either.\\n\\n\r\nObviously one of the most important factors in these shows is the main protagonist. Everything centers around them, after all. Harem genre in general, unfortunately, does not have much variety in what main characters they could have. Very rarely you have protagonists like Keima, who is on a class of his own, or Shidou, who's at least likeable despite being incredibly generic just because he's not an annoying piece of shit that causes more problems for himself than everything else in the show. And then you have Issei. This protagonist just happens to be one of the obnoxious protagonists you could have in a show, harem or not. Did you ever watch other shows and saw that silly \"perverted guy\" who always hangs out near the main character and only exists as a brief comic relief? Yeah, that guy is a main protagonist now. Hope you liked those brief comic reliefs, because that's definitely not going to get old after an entire series. \\n\\n\r\nIf that wasn't bad enough, he's also \"that\" guy who happens to have one of the most powerful McGuffins in the series, which makes him suddenly important. Normally this wouldn't be too offensive since it's done by literally every other show, where the protagonist happens to have that special trait that gives him unfair advantage no matter what, but the way this show handles it is just terrible. \\n\\n\r\nYou see, the side characters that Rias has under her are supposed to represent what Issei lacks- Outside of them being awfully shallow as characters and merely existing to pander to specific parts of the audience as overdone archetypical tools that are in nearly any JRPG ever, they are supposed to exist to make Issei feel comparatively inferior. In fact, in the last episode, Issei talks about how he lacks the strength, healing ability, magical ability, or swordfighting skills while fighting the obligatory final boss of the season- Does this all matter? No. He has the most powerful weapon shown in the series so far, so why is this relevant? What was the point of making him seem \"inferior\" to others when all he has to do is do the typical resolve speech and it will make him just instantly more powerful than everyone else? \\n\\n\r\nLet's put that in this context and see if that sounds any less ridiculous:\\n\r\n\"I may not have a bamboo stick, boxing gloves, or a first-aid kit, but I have a rifle that I can shoot you with.\"\\n\\n\r\nNo, it still sounds dumb as shit. I also liked that chess analogy that the show kept bringing it up, though. It's almost like it's just there for the sake of being pretentious. And it is. \\n\\n\r\nAs for Rias, she's just bland as any other character in this show. She even goes on a speech about how she wants to be seen as Rias/herself and not be carried by her family name and nobility- Huh, that sounds awfully familiar. Oh, that's right- That's every Disney princess speech about how they're so perfect that it's bad. Outside of that, she falls in love with Issei because he's the main character and also because her fiancee conveniently happens to be a pretty huge dick like again, every Disney princess plot. While I'm not looking for super originality here, it's pretty bad if you're ripping off the fucking Disney routine.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, it doesn't help considering the second half of the show involves this Disney princess routine being played out for too many episodes while the first half involves this clearly not evil girl suddenly calling Issei out on a date only to show her true evil nature in the same episode. The asinine pacing can be further shown by how Issei goes on later about how he truly cared about this girl he met for less than a day and how he's sad to realize that she was evil all along. Am I supposed to feel sad here? Later, Issei meets this other random girl, who he also met for less than a day, and later on she gets captured by the aforementioned evil girl, and then she experiences a horrible Disney death on a techno-cross. Good thing Rias can resurrect dead people, so that didn't matter in the end. The great part is that there was supposed to be this time limit about saving her before it was too late, but that turned out to be totally irrelevant too. Way to build tension and break it in the same episode. Trivialize an already inconsequential death of a girl that the MC has met for less than a day is truly the best way to invoke emotions.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other elements of the show, the music is pretty generic, but not painful to listen to. The animation is also incredibly average, which is about what you'd expect from a show of this genre. Though if I had to point out a flaw, it would be that the character designs were just really generic. If you can't give your characters any depth, at least make them look interesting. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show is bad. Shallow characters, annoying main character, irrelevant consequences (including how the MC \"sacrificed\" his arm for a power up, which was completely inconsequential), lack of an actual antagonist with an actual motive, and just overall being boring. It's downright offensive. The pacing was all over the place, and including quarter of the show with fillers is probably the most retarded idea one could come up with. \\n\\n\r\nFrankly, for the longest time, I've been wondering why these harem shows were mostly awful. Maybe it's the overwhelming amount of pandering shoved into my face that is causing me to not enjoy these shows very much. Maybe. But more than likely it's just because they're fucking terrible. I tried to watch this all the way through while ignoring all the pandering so that maybe I could appreciate the hidden depth within. Or the lack thereof. \\n\\n\r\nIt didn't turn out well after all. Let's not try that again. And neither should you.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "High School DxD is an anime that has been praised as the best ecchi ever made, and in a way that is accurate. Seriously though, it is an ecchi. For all of you ecchi haters, stay away. Shove down your masochistic tendencies and walk away, this is not an anime you are going to enjoy. \r\nWe all know what we are getting into when we turn this show on, copious amounts of T&A. High School DxD has quickly become synonymous with that phrase. But even then, that was not the sole reason I turned this show on. I generally am the type that needs abit more than titillating imagery to watch something. So when I heard that DxD also had this really cool story to accompany it, I was sold. Allow me to inform you that I can in good conscience say I feel betrayed...\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\n*SIGH* \\n\r\nBefore going into the specifics of the story that follows the characters, let me say that the overall concept of this world is what truly piqued my interest in the show. A three way war between Devils, Angels, and Fallen Angels. An expansive world with history behind it. Varying degrees of mythology from different countries. Sadly, these aspects are quickly overshadowed by the story surrounding the main character. \\n\r\nHigh School setting? Expected. It's in the bloody title. But what I wasn't expecting was a poor story about a servant and his literal power-ups. The story wants to be serious, but fails miserably at it. The so called \"emotional\" moments had me rolling my eyes, and the dialogue left me stunned from how many cliche Shounen lines it had. \\n\r\nI am attempting to avoid spoilers, which is why I am avoiding the specifics that made this story as bad as it was. Just know this, it is a cool concept that loses points due to the execution. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nIt was good and filled to the brim with boobs and panty-shots. I don't know what else I can really say. It was nothing spectacular, but is by no means un-watchable. Standard fare for when it was released. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe OST was pretty solid. The music did a surprisingly good job of adding to the scenes. \\n\r\nThe standout aspect of the sound for me was actually the voice acting. I watched the show dubbed, but I have seen enough of the subbed to know that both are good. But in my opinion, watch the show dubbed. The voices may actually be more fitting in the subbed, personal preference really. But the dub has dialogue that adds to the hilarity of the scenes exponentially. When the MC can \"promise not to drain his pimp-juice\", it's a damn fine dub.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nIssei- An extremely typical pervert. I really, really disliked Issei. He is literally an idiot, and every single one of his thoughts revolves around something lewd. Of course he is also a decent guy with a heart of gold, but hey, that's just par for the course. He is established early on as a good hearted pervert, and he remains a good hearted pervert until the end. He does gain a bit of development, but it really is just a bit. \\n\\n\r\nRias Gremory- Here we have the gorgeous, devil senpai you read about in the description. A surprisingly decent character. She is strong willed, honest, and oddly compassionate. Peculiar for a devil, but this show does break the occasional trope. What I liked about her character was how she took everything for what it was. Fully acknowledging and accepting Issei's perversion, and using it as a motivation. She doesn't care what other people think, and does as she wishes. \\n\\n\r\nAsia- Rarely have I found a more stereotypical \"nice girl\". She is incredibly sweet to everyone, a bit naive and innocent, and completely incapable of defending herself. Did I mention she's a nun that falls for the main character instantly. I didn't dislike Asia, but I found it hard to like her as she hardly felt like a character. She was immediately filed into my brain as a ball of cliches, and I felt nothing for her because of that. \\n\\n\r\nThe notable side characters are Akeno, Kiba, and Koneko. The busty sadist with a kind exterior, the respectful pretty boy, and the expressionless loli with a love for sweets, respectively. I was a big fan of these characters, and really wanted to see more of them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5 \\n\r\nThere are a few things to enjoy about this anime, maybe you enjoy the comedy, the action, or the titillating imagery. For me, the comedy was hit or miss. Some jokes I loved, others I hated. The ones I hated usually pertained to Issei's perversion, it is such an overused concept that I don't even crack a smile. The comedy I loved was mostly in regards to the dialogue, definitely my favorite part. \\n\r\nI really liked the action. Especially in the later episodes, I felt genuinely invested in what was happening. The action was accompanied by serious tones without being emotional tones, and they were pretty well done. \\n\r\nThe massive amounts of fan-service in this show really didn't do much on the enjoyment factor either. It doesn't lose any points, but boobs and panty-shots alone don't do anything. I suppose if you pause during one of Issei's fantasies you could pitch a tent, but it didn't do much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nBy that score alone, you may think it isn't worth watching. A passable story with some decent characters and good dialogue, seems like it isn't worth your time. But for all of you ecchi fans, and for those who can at least tolerate ecchi, this is worth watching. Why? Because it gets better. The first season of High School DxD really isn't that good, but the second season is good, and you can expect it to improve from there. Being knowledgeable about the original source material, many of the flaws in this anime will be fixed. The story will improve, characters will develop, it will become a good fantasy story. \\n\r\nOne aspect of High School DxD that I applaud the creator for is his honesty in regards to fan-service. He makes the fan-service a plot point by truly involving it in the MC's drives (and later abilities). He gives the fan-service a plausible reason for existing considering the amoral nature of the devils. The author embraces fan-service, which is a unique aspect I award credit for. \\n\\n\r\nHigh School DxD is an ecchi that develops into a good story. Anyone who tries to pass this first season off as the best ecchi ever is just lying to you. But it is worth watching just to see what comes later.",

            "content": "High School DxD is based on the light novels written by Ichiei Ishibumi and illustrated by Miyama-Zero. It stands out from the other ecchi harems that I have seen in sense that the first season cannot really be considered a harem but rather Issei going after the female love interest Rias Gremory. Some of the other female characters do show interest such as Asia when Issei becomes more intimate with the other girls. But the real harem aspects of High School DxD show up in the second season. If you are a fan of the ecchi genre you will be pleased to hear that DxDhas plenty of perverted panty shots and uncensored boobs. I went into it not knowing what to expect, and surprisingly it has exceeded the relatively low expectations I had for it. \\n\\n\r\nHigh School DxD falls into the \"it's good for what it is\" category and does not try to be something it is not. This is why it should be viewed as first and foremost a fan service show. With some laugh out loud moments, senseless antics and occasional dramatic tones in the overarching plot. This is what makes it stand out from most other ecchi\u2019s that resort to covering an unintelligible story with lots of fan service. High School DxD has an actual story and distinctive character development. With the fan service aside the show actually does have its merits. I particularly like the art style, decent visuals, and the music score.  \\n\\n\r\nHigh School DxD gives you a lot of variety in the female characters as well as the situations they get undressed. The girls of the Occult Research Club range from Koneko, a very petite and small breasted girl who displays a lack of emotion and seems rather unaffected by everything. To Akeno who is busty and seems to take some enjoyment from Issei\u2019s antics. As well as the voluptuous Rias with Asia more on the petite side. All of the female characters are sexy and attractive in different ways. \\n\\n\r\nHigh School DxD is all about mindless fun with a respectable amount of T&A. Evaluate it as a fan service focused series; it delivers on what it is, an ecchi harem comedy with an angels versus devils versus fallen angles aspect (This can get pretty confusing and doesn't make sense at times). It is a little better than average and one of the top recent series in its genre. Don\u2019t go into watching this with the wrong mentality expecting it to be something it is not. You will be disappointed, watch it for what it is and you may find enough enjoyment to keep watching. I would recommend it to anyone new to ecchi and if this sounds interesting to anyone they should definitely check it out.  \\n\r\nOverall=7          \\n",

            "content": "Being a massive fan of the DxD series, I absolutely loved the anime adaptation. Anyone who has read the light novels would realise just how much emotional depth all the characters go through, especially Issei (the main protagonist) who I can only say had a VERY traumatic first girlfriend experience. High School DxD has a new take to a harem story, the author guaranteed a happy ending for all the girls and the plot is getting results that show it unlike other harem stories which can just end up a pain in the neck as the main protagonist is unable to choose.\r\nFirst of all, youcan immediately see the amazing art of the anime which can live up / match on par to the beautiful character designs that Miyama-Zero created. This of course closely ties into the effects used in the animation which were pretty much spot on to how i imagined them to be, especially in the battle scenes.\\n\\n\r\nYou hear a lot of people complain about this series being \"too ecchi\" and put you off from watching but you'll just be missing out. This series was made with ecchi in mind but not to the degree of other series such as To Love Ru or Sekirei; they're pretty much several times worse in terms of ecchi level. However, I will say that the anime did add more fanservice and nude scenes than the original novel which many may think as a way to get views and sales. I myself am glad they did, not because there's more ecchi scenes to see but because it increases the chances of another season. The reason why im hoping for more of the anime is because the best parts of the story are towards to latter half of the light novel volumes and I would like to see it animated. The extra fanservice was doen in good taste and suited the pace of the story so it can be overlooked.\\n\r\nThis might be seen as hateful to do but the fact is that it wasnt done in a hateful manner; they didnt censor the all the scenes like the Majikoi anime where it pretty much forces you to buy the uncensored DVD / Blu-Ray releases.\\n\\n\r\nFor anyone who thinks that there is little character development, I can now inform you that a second season is going into production and I guarantee that you wont be disappointed with the new characters that are going to appear. Every character has a part of themselves that is kept hidden past but the troubles are overcome through the friendship and relationship amongst the group. \\n\r\n*Small spoiler* For the more battle loving fans, Issei's predetermined external rival will arrive soon\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there were some unnecessary parts included to buff out the anime, namely by including some of the short stories, the anime remained rather faithful towards the original story. In reality, it would have been better if they spent more time on the main plot to include more details and make the short stories into OVAs. \\n\r\nOf course, they didnt miss out some infamous lines where the most memorable one appears in episode 12 of the anime. It would have been preposterous for them to have missed out that one.\\n\\n\r\nI know that this review may have strayed from just talking about this season of this anime and I apologise for that however, I needed to bring in other factors in hope that all you out there give this a shot and persuade you to watch it as the foundation to the greatness that is to follow. Reviewing DxD in such constricted context does not bring it justice. \\n\\n\r\nOn a final note, don't watch this with females unless you know they're alright with an ecchi series...They're only going to get jealous with the beautiful female characters",

Character - 7\\n\\n\r\nUPDATED: The plot of the show has progressed in such a manner that there are now a more clear idea of a general enemy(s) and task(s) that the Gremory Clan must vanquish/complete. The plot in itself has actually surprised me, in a good way, from what I would expect from this sub-genre. overall its done enough to pull itself clear from medicore to above average. - 7~7.5\\n\\n\r\nThe combination of classical and more modern music sets a nice, and appropriate, background theme for the series. The voice actors/actresses, for the most part, seem to fit the roles well. **Although I'm not a huge fan of the OP the ED is rather enjoyable - 8\\n\\n\r\nWhile the art, while nothing spectacular, did manage to get in a few nice transformation sequences, and it appears that they budgeted appropriately for the action sequences, something That I was rather happy and surprised to see after last season Itsuka Tenma.  - 7 (down from 8 due to some lesser quality sequences, although with BDs it could go as high as 9)\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is worth a watch, especially with so little on the table this season. While not fantastic in any one department it does its job well enough that, at least for me, I was entertained throughout. Overall - 7 /10\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE: I'm very on the fence about this score now to me the show has managed to prove that it can seperate itself from the pack, But I don't quite feel it deserves an 8 yet, as such my overall grade is a 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nnext update to come when the series ends, pending anything GLORIOUS or horrendous.",

            "content": "Oppai, man we aaaall love oppai, they're round, good lookin, have a nipple in the middle. Man, but what about big oppai? Maybe oppai every single episode? Welp you got it! And thats Highschool DxD for ya, oppai or in english term, tits,boobs,melons,bozangas,milk-makers, I COULD GO ON ALL DAY. This show is a pretty weird example of fanservice, you got it everywhere! Hell some episodes nearly feel like filler episodes till the end of the episodes that continue the story. I came out of this show with no pants and a wet dick, but for now lets get to the review. Shall we?\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nSo westart off with Issei, a typical pervert who peeks on girls with his pals at high-school. One day he meets this girl and goes out on a date with her, and well Issei gets killed by this bi- I mean girl and she turns out to be a, \"fallen angel\" DUN DUN DUUUUUN! So in Issei's final seconds he thinks about a girl called Rias who he saw earlier ago, and he ends up summoning her cause she's a demon! DUN DUUUUUUUUN. And this is where our adventure begins. This story goes on till episode 6 with filler, fanservice and the plot is kind of messy at times and hell at times I was wondering, \"Am I watching anime, or softcore hentai?\" Theres many oppais and a lot of shit going on, you just get confused. One moment Issei progesses the story by learning something another second he's being a pervert and theres oppais everywhere.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nTheres not much to say about the art, it dosen't look half bad, the colours look nice, the animation is smooth. Overall its ok, not much to say but it fits the show. A little more detail can be put in but its ok, overall.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nFor a show filled with fanservice, the music is really well done! The opening is a very nice and calm tune showing you what to expect in this show. The ending is this great and upbeat tune kind of like you're watching a play and you're about to leave and they put this Up beat song, this is probably what it would be. Songs go from slow and beautiful tones to Epic and Mighty tunes pumping up your heart! The sound quality is overall well done and good as hell.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nThere are 3 main characters that we are focused on. First you got Issei, typical pervert, At times I like Issei at times I hate him, he usually does everything wrong that just makes me wanna kick his ass until he realizes he's an idiot. At times he could actually be pretty humurous and make some ol'jokes. Then you got Rias, she's a pretty good character, she usually does whats best for Issei and sure she only changes a bit in the end of the series but you just can't help but like  her. Then you got Asia, your cliched character who falls in love with the MC, will get jealous if someone trys to do anything romantic with him and the usual cliches. Her backstory is pretty explainable itself but she's too generic. The character developements aren't really strong and feel meh, like they aren't trying.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nWithout the humor, fanservice, filler and oppai this show would be pretty boring, so I give props for that stuff being there, overall this show will hook you from the start and you'll probably watch it till the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7//10\\n\r\nThis show is enjoyable and pretty good overall. I have no problem with fanservice so I was able to watch this at ease. If you have a problem with fanservice or overall hate it. Stay from this show like its poop. If not you'll easily enjoy this show, if you go through this show without fapping once, you're tough enough to be in the weenies club. Cause theres a LOT of fappable content, so make sure you have some lotion ready before watching this.",

At the end of watching you will feel like its a normal anime but not at the same time because of the nudity. \r\nEND you can stop readingnow.... just go watch and rate the review if you find it helpful and please watch at least 5ep before dropping it #justsaying. \\n\\n\r\nOther Notes :\\n\\n\r\nthe main character is quite well thought out and he actually works to prove his worth and make's girls fall for him him that I can say is what a harem anime should be. Guys proving themselves it makes more scenes that way \\n\\n\r\nother then that Sound,art are great too. nude scenes are well shown with good reason (most of the time) \\n\r\nmost are due to fights but not just because they need to add fan services but it does add the realistically to the show\\n\r\nother reason well... you'll just have to watch..\\n\\n\r\nif you are still here you must like to read. \\n\r\nif you like please message me if you find it of help or you can share your thoughts about the review. \\n\\n\r\nthoughts , \\n\r\nI really like this show and it has proven that anime is not just about boobs \\n\r\nwish there where more shows like this imagine one piece or bleach had clothes ripping apart haha \\n\r\njust kidding though but would like to see a long anime with that.. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nBoth film and television have a great number of genres and sub-genres. Some of these sub-genres are quite easy to pull off, like the \"jump scare\" adolescent horror movies that Blumhouse shits out every year! All you have to do is follow the same cookie cutter formula and your low budget schlock film will make back at least 800% of its budget and receive decent reviews! One of the most difficult sub-genres to actually execute well is the \"completely self aware, so bad it's good comedy\". Many studios and directors attempt to tackle this sub-genre with films like \"Sharknado\" or \"Snakes on a Plane\" butalmost ALWAYS the result ends up being boring and predictable instead of actually funny and amusing. Anime studios have also recently entered into this sub-genre with shows like High School of the Dead, but  High school DxD largely succeeds where High school of the Dead fell flat on its face. DxD remembers to NEVER take itself seriously and most importantly to keep its jokes and line delivery actually funny! \\n\\n\r\nPlot:\\n\\n\r\nDo you like boobs? Do you like lots of blood? Do you like not being bothered with such cumbersome inconveniences as character development or a well written plot? This is the show for you! DxD is a story about a pervert that joins a largely female school to try gain his own harem. Instead he remains a virgin and a social pariah until the power of his bullshit \"MacGuffin\" forces him to choose a side in a faction war between Demons, Angels, and Fallen Angels. The Demon faction are different from the fallen angels and were not created by Jehovah unlike the Angels and Fallen Angels. In the beginning of time, several powerful races came into being including Gods (of whom Jehovah is one of many), the demons, and the dragons. Jehovah/Allah unlike his brothers Zeus and Odin decided to try wipe out the Demons and created the Angels as his personal army. However, some of the angels were immoral and slept with human women, so Jehovah/Allah cast them out and they became the Fallen Angels or \"Grigori\". The fallen Angels tried to exterminate the Demons in order to win back Jehovah's favor, but Jehovah decided to declare war on both factions and start a 3 way war. This war devastated the ranks of the 3 armies and killed both Jehovah and the 4 original Demon Kings called \"Satans\". To the present day an uneasy truce has been kept between the surviving members of these factions. The plot in addition to absurd comedy, shameless fanservice, and slapstick serves as a giant FUCK YOU to religion and insults every religion in equal measure. It's almost as if Bill Maher wrote this series...only its too funny for him to have been the author. DxD frequently references other anime and is VERY aware of all the tropes it is using including ripping off DBZ and perpetually name dropping obscure demons, angels, and other kaballah related terms as a middle finger to Evangelion's admittedly insufferable use of this technique.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters from the main male protagonist Issei to the female protagonist Rias are very cardboard archetypes. The series doesn't take itself seriously and never actually tries to develop these characters because the entire point of the series is to be enjoyably idiotic bullshit. This was actually the right move for DxD because it becomes very annoying when a REALLY stupid series actually tries to take itself seriously and demands that the viewer respect its dignity. I'm looking at you Seikon no Qwasar!\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound:\\n\\n\r\nThe art predictably features absurdly large breasts that move in ways that completely fuck the laws of physics. However, unlike Maoyuu Yuusha, which has similar breasts and then suddenly demands that the viewer put on a sophisticated cap and discuss theories of agricultural distribution, DxD KNOWS how stupid its breasts are and revels in it! The English dub is actually excellent and the soundtrack is decent. Overall, surprisingly not bad from a purely technical view.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nHigh School DxD is NOT a good anime by any means. However, it knows exactly how to be that special type of bad that is still for some reason amusing. You will grin like the Cheshire Cat while watching a train wreck in slow motion! I'm not saying I actually recommend this series, but if you want echii bullshit you could do WAY worse! At least this series is WAY better than Food Wars!",

            "content": "If you are no fan of the ecchi genre, please exit this review and spend your time on other reviews. I've been hearing adults say that the arts nowadays are not really emphasised. Well, I beg to differ. Body art is an aspect of art in which many people are spending time in. Animes also have quite a decent amount of genre with the aspect of body art a.k.a ecchi genres. Of course, this anime too. Read the synopsis your own as I'm diving straight through into the review.\r\nStory:\r\n  THIS ISN'T PORN! It's just ecchi. All of my friends were like OMG! YOU WATCHPORN! Come on. It's categorised as ecchi not hentai. You might think I'm lying but this anime honestly has a good plot. Many of my friends were like: Yeah you watch this anime for the \"plot\". Seriously, if you were to watch this anime without labelling it, it actually has an impressive and interesting plot. First Issei gets reborn as a devil. Few episodes dedicated to introduce other characters and for character development purposes. Towards the end of the anime was the most exciting part of this anime. The Rating Game. Really really cool. During that time my heart gets pumping so vigorously that I can feel its sheer impact. Again, it's the plot that made my heart pump so hard, rarely to do with the body art.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n  Nothing much to comment about the art. Quite decently done for a 2012 anime. Really beautiful and impressive art I should say.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n  Not a main aspect of this anime in my opinion. However, I do agree that the Opening song was very catchy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n  A very important aspect of this anime. Issei(MC)- pervertic and oh that's all. He's always thinking about oppai no matter what. Be it when everyone is in danger or when everyone is taking a rest. Anytime and anywhere. Rias-a high-ranking devil. Nothing much to talk about except for the fact that she's really beautiful and powerful. Akeno- hehehe. I challenge you to not wiki her when watching the anime. Quite an interesting and unexpected character. Asia- she should just buzz off. Ugly, annoying, extra and weak. Can practically do nothing much. Kiba- nothing much to comment on. Koneko-I would term her as a silent killer. Watch to find out why I call her that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n  With a fairly decent and interesting plot topped with the aspect of body art, How could one agree that this anime is lousy and boring? Really, trust me. This anime has indeed a very interesting plot especially towards the end where they played The Rating Game. I would say I really enjoyed this anime. Please do not watch this in front of your parents as they might just label this as porn. Alternatively, you could agree that you are pursuing your passion for body art since people nowadays are more likely to be pursuing something that would pay them well. I think you could more or less get away with it.\\n\\n\r\nThank you",

            "content": "Every once in a while an anime comes around that is so well done you have an eyegasm after every episode, simply put a masterpiece......\r\nyeah, this isn't really that anime.\r\nFrom personal observations I've noticed that people who can't stand fanservice shoot down an anime because of fanservice. I find them to be more annoying and painful than bamboo splinters under my fingernails. I dont really understand why they keep watching, if thats the type of anime they hate with a passion, then why? Are they masochists? Are they closet pervs who just don't want to admit it? The fact of the matter is that ifyou're against it this anime isn't for you, no need to keep reading. If you don't like ecchi, dont watch it!\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the actual review.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad\\n\r\n-the main issue with harems is the character development, this be no exception. The main character is the stereotypical average student with a now common \"want to protect\" mindset. I didn't really see much character development, however I, from my view point, did see some (I mentioning feel explaining would spoil) but I can't truly knock it down too much, unlike if it was to be a series with much more time in which i would have been pissed. \\n\r\n-I found the plot to be nothing really special and has a set up that I feel I've seen before.\\n\r\n-The plot did have its holes and unanswered questions by the end, with only a temporary resolution yet its not that big of an issue because they were things that could easily be answered in the second season, unless they explain fuck all in the next season, at which time i will pray the director's crab's get herpies.\\n\r\n-The setting, you guest it, a highschool, i need not go on.\\n\r\n-The animation was really nothing exceptional there is very much a lack of eyegasm in this sense as nothing really pops out at you except boobs and someone's boner if not your own.\\n\r\n-The music didn't leave ear bleeding, but was only slightly above good.\\n\r\n-I will say it. At times, the ecchi does get very excessive however I don't qualify that as an excuse to throw this in the crap pile, its not really that unbearable.\\n\\n\r\nThe good\\n\r\n-to redeem the setting itself, it did have some diversity because even though the title of the anime is high school dxd, i found the situations to have nearly nothing to do with high school. There is the clubhouse but they normally just meet and move elsewhere from there. I just found it to be more of a building/base than an average school. \\n\r\n-The comedy (probably a bit bias here) was the type I find funny, I am very much the type to appreciate a sexual joke, don't give a dam if Im called a perv at least I dont hide it, but there are some other mixed in. \\n\r\n-Idk if accel world  made me realize this but I did notice that the chicks in this anime don't just magically fall in love with him left and right, which I find to be preferable. The ones that do fall for him are ones that have a reason to after some connection between them and it doesnt happen with every fucking girl.\\n\r\n-There were some action scenes that coming into the fight gave me chills and that \"shits about to go down\" feeling we all love.\\n\\n\r\nThe unexplainable\\n\r\nFrom everything gathered it would be guessed that this is just a regular anime with not much to offer as with average animation, sound, plot, ext. However, the fact of the matter is this anime is on my favorites list to this day. Why? its obvious I'm aware of its flaws, then why? truthfully I can't explain it.\\n\r\nLooking at it from a reviewer's perspective this is just an average anime. \\n\r\nYet, looking at it from an average viewer who values enjoyment value above all else, I truly loved it. Idk maybe its just im more indecisive than Romney, but I found it to be enjoyable as fuck. This anime just has that \"guilty pleasure\" feel. Its the kind of weird shit that if people were to come into my room I would switch to porn, because that is just so much easier to explain. So many people I know bash its flaws, yet can't wait for a second season. I went through this shit in a siting and was glad I did.\\n\\n\r\nThe verdict\\n\r\nOverall I give this anime a rating of guilty pleasure that through its flaws is just inexplicably addictive.\\n\r\nI recommend (unless ur allergic to boobs and ass and life)",

            "content": "With such series' like Rosario Vampire and Aki-Sora, the ecchi and harem genre has never been stronger. It is with such series going around that the genre being what it is that makes High School DxD an instant hit for fans of the genre. On the surface, it's an over-the-top, high-paced, fan-serviced spectacle that many fans of this genre love. With its rather cliche plot and possibly even more cliche characters, it'll capture you granted that you don't mind tits and asses.\r\nStorywise, it starts out slow. The build-up is slow and the way the overall premise is established is slightly faster, but still very muchslow. The story goes through two arcs in the first season. Possibly one of the highlights is the insults of the writing. Yes, I definitely think that the insults and the multiple ways of calling a person a douche and even the multiple terms for wanting to have sex with someone. Granted, sometimes the writing interferes with the story, but as I stated, the story itself is a bit cliche, but it catches on and somehow you'll find yourself being drawn to it.\\n\\n\r\nI think one of the most impressive things about this series is the art style. It's with the art that one is drawn to an anime or manga first. We look with our eyes before we read and delve into the universe presented to us in the visual form. The fluid animation brings an added bonus to the art itself. It just might be the best thing about the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe musical score and other such sound effects really brought the series to life. With a brilliant composer such as Ryosuke Nakanishi, it's hard not to just fall deeply in love with the music. I will admit that at times it slightly felt out of place, but that's only in the smallest of ways. \\n\\n\r\nAs stated beforehand, the characters took a while to build and some of them had cliche moments, but there definitely was a good amount of heart put forth into them. As much as the series is fan service, the characters showed surprising development in the twelve episodes. That's not to say that there weren't moments where I had my doubts \u2014 cause there were. There were even some characters that I felt that could have been left out. Hell, there were even some characters that I felt were wasted opportunities. Still, with that being said, I felt the main characters, at least, were handled well.\\n\\n\r\nSo, overall the series is good for those who like harem, ecchi, laugh-out-loud moments, and over-the-top action that makes one question their sanity. It's a good time and the heart is there. My final score is 7/10.",

            "content": "Alright,my review is short as usual but I will conclude my own perception about this anime. If you are the fans of ecchi based or harem based anime,here is the must watch series for you.\r\nStoryline: (8/10)\r\nStoryline is pretty straight forward.As usual the story starts with a single hint and then a flashback of story.But I think its not necessary. I will not touch to the sypnosis here but, from the first ep, you will found out what the story main theme. There is girls battle with magic in a school life environment, some sort of hidden power on the main lead character, and a littlebit of harem blended with uncensored ecchi(some).\\n\\n\r\nArt: (8/10)\\n\r\nAnime art is pretty good for me. If you have watch recents released anime series or last season series, its almost the same. Not much to comment about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:(8/10)\\n\r\nThe main lead is totally weak,brainless and weak( maybe he will be storng after awakened). Its normal for harem/ ecchi based anime, the main character usually weak but in some sort of condition,He will be the hero of the story. Hehe...\\n\r\nI'm not going to touch about the girls since the first ep did not shows a lot about them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nThe main enjoyment is mostly on the ecchi and harem theme of the anime. Not the main storyline....nahhh most of you will think (I watch this anime not because the storyline but the anime ecchiness and of course I am harem lover)\\n\r\nFor me, the storyline is pretty good when packed with this kind of elements.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nThis anime concludes most of attractive elements such as ecchi,harem,school life,magic,battle or maybe shounen and nudity. So, I think you should watch this show, dont take it serieously, this anime would be watch for fun and makes me feel relaxes after some serious show.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: This was the first anime I ever watched, so I probably enjoyed it more than the average anime lover :3\r\nThis anime is good, great, fantastic! It's full of hilarious moments, badass action scenes, and an admirable try-hard main character. When I watched High School DxD, the fantasy really stood out for me (although I didn't have any other anime to compare it to at the time). The magic circles, giant dragons, explosions and amazing super powers that made the eyes drool (metaphorically), it was truly a great start to my life as an otaku. \r\nLooking back, the story and character development was pretty weak,but that's besides the point. I didn't watch it for the story and characters. I enjoyed the art, I loved Issei's perverted antics and the priceless looks on his face when anything lewd happened. It made for a hilarious watching and that is why I have rated my enjoyment so high. Considering I had never before seen a show about a perverted boy and giant boobs (and small boobs for that matter), this show felt fresh, daring and exciting and it had me at the edge of my seat gawping and thinking 'DID THAT REALLY JUST HAPPEN???'. \\n\\n\r\nAnother point is the random, and often too plentiful changes in mood that the show went through. Halfway through fights which are supposed to be serious and cool, are interjected by sexual jokes and slapstick comedy. Depending on what you like, it's either a blessing or a reason to not watch the show. Although I would say this show is mainly a comedy so expect silliness galore! \\n\\n\r\nFinally, I must warn you of the amount of fanservice this show contains (For those of you unsure what I mean, there are boobs everywhere, and quite often the inappropriate panty shot. (Those Japanese... *sighs*) If you're not into it, then you will probably find this show difficult to watch. But, if you're an avid anime fan, you're probably used to it so you shouldn't mind. And remember, this show is ecchi - not hentai. There is no sex in this show! \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I loved the show. It is a great laugh and has great fantasy elements! The OP and ED songs are very enjoyable and as a whole, I highly recommend High School DxD to those who like magic and high school boy shows (and aren't too put off by the fanservice). I hope this review helped you a little bit! (\u1551\u15e2\u0942\u14eb\u2217)",

Boink! Boink!\r\nThe story is suppose to revolve around a guy name Issei who is a student in a former all girls school turned coed however it is focus chaotically around the plot where it is a the bad vs evil kind of thing.\r\nArt: Good 7. Boink! Boink!\r\nOk, so I need not say why, since this anime is all aboutboobs, panty shots and naked bodies. Oh, and I kinda like the way the school uniform for girls was drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fair 6 . Boink! Boink!\\n\\n\r\nI just like the opening theme, that's all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Poor 3. Boink ! Boink!\\n\\n\r\nLet's to each of the protagonist of this anime:\\n\\n\r\nIssei Hoyodo- I don't like the way where he's typecast a a stupid character who doesn't know what he has and what he can do and all he has in his mind is porn, I don't quite understand as to why a fallen angel would go after him if he can be used to fight off demons since he's a sacred gear holder. Frankly everything that happens to this character is too easy so much so that any spunk in his character is lost and replaced with disgust pertaining to his stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nRias Gremory- She's  demon with linage, which should be reserve for vampires, ok so she the big boss of her posse and she's in love with the stupid Issei..... too easy for her role as a demon with class, it's obvious that the author is simply banking on her fanservice and nothing more. \\n\\n\r\nAsia Argento- She's also on the same boat as Rias except she a much sweeter character, again her romance with Issei is too easy and it's her fansrevice that makes up for her character. \\n\\n\r\nHimejima Akeno- she being a half fallen angel half demon don't seem to add up as being one of Rias' posse, in fact she more of a tease in this anime than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nKiba Yuuto- he's more like an extra and nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nToujo Koneko- ok so she's the the team's muscle and more like a flat chested fanservice type.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what we have are a bunch of demons whose capability is a mismatch as to what is expected of the usual demon thing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: Fair 6. Boink! Boink! Boink! Boink!\\n\\n\r\nI could have given this anime a poor rating, but I've thought that since there are a couple of laughs that comes with this anime and a lot of fanservice, I guess that the poor story can be brush aside and just focus on the guys stupidity which is both disgusting and funny and the girls' fanservice, definitely not for guys who expects a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe End. Boink! Boink! (.)(.)\\n",

            "content": "Highschool DXD is really underrated in my opinion. Although it's often mentioned as \"pure echii\" people fail to see the creativity and the original concept that the anime has taken. Sure, it's easy to just ignore all the good points and say \"this anime is only about oppai\", but I beliebe there is more to that.\r\nWhile the story start in a simple way, it quickly develop a far more serious tone. It begin in a \"ultimate harem\" anime and we can see the great world building and the very unique way that the plot is displayed. While I can understand why people would drop itin early stage, they should try at least get to the last three episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are simply amazing. Whether it's the cool rias, the pervert akeno or the quiet koneko. With issei they all begin as a mere overused archtypes characters but as the show goes on we can see that they are growing as a person, espeacially issei. And if I already talk about Issei, in the first episodes he is misjudged as a hopeless pervert but we can see later on that he really cares about other people and trying to achieve his dream (even if his dream is stupid)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is OK for this show, nothing much about that. The art is great, all the girls are simply beautiful. The soundtrack wasn't so memorable, but the op and ed were great.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think that people don't see the true merit of DXD, only because some boobs hide it from them. I will end this by saying-give oppai a chance.",

            "content": "Perhaps there is no genre that can spark feuds like ecchi; we have two opposing armies, the rabid fans and the harsh critics, baying for each other's blood, their cause of animosity being nothing other than the fact that the former labels a particular series as \"one of, if not the greatest anime ever made\" and the latter has branded it with the slightly less esteemed label of human (maybe animal) excreta. However, the general opinion among (sane) people from both camps (and neutral observers like me) is that the viewer needs a little more than umpteen-per-episode panty shots and boobs that look and bouncelike basketballs, in order for a series to be worth watching. We've waited for ages for the ecchi series that would bring in a breath of fresh air to a genre being suffocated by bad comedy, stereotyped females and essentially wooden males (who serve only three purposes : to receive female attention, to whine and/or to occasionally become really strong or suave depending on whether the series is action or SOL). This wonderful series would have just the right amount of fanservice with adequate character development and REAL depth. That would be--wait for it-- The Ideal Ecchi.*drums in background*\\n\\n\r\nIt seems we still need to wait. 'Cause HSDxD is, to all intents and purposes, created from the same mould of typical ecchi that fans love and critics abuse.\\n\\n\r\nNow mentally you may have already placed me in the 'harsh critic' category, but one fact is true--I did like HSDxD. So without adding to this already huge intro, I'll jump straightaway into the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory:5\\n\r\nAbsolutely generic. A typical high school pervert gets killed by a girl on his date and gets reincarnated by a devil. He discovers that he has (Big surprise) an incredibly powerful weapon in his left arm, and as a devil, becomes determined to create his own harem (Pretty noble, huh?). On the way he also gets attached to everyone around him and powers up whenever they are hurt, etc etc.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nI'm no art connoisseur, but I loved the art. Characters were well drawn and animation was pretty fluid all the way.\\n\\n\r\nSound:7\\n\r\nNothing much to say really, I don't know if it'll stick with you, but it's quit decent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:6\\n\r\nCharacterization is still the Achilles' heel of ecchi, but despite being bogged down by stereotypes, High School DxD does attain some respectability. The backstories of the female characters like Asia and Rias are quite believable, and there are moments where you actually care about the characters, which is a really rare feeling as far as ecchi is concerned.\\n\r\nThere are drawbacks, though, the biggest of which is our perverted-but-loved-by-all MC Issei Hyoudou, who has absolutely no qualities other than recklessness, very crude intelligence (he tries to make it look cool but fails) and an uncanny ability to be useless in all situations except the eleventh hour ones. There are other problems too:there is hardly any effort put in side characters other than making them fanservice elements, and those same stupid predictable situations common to the genre. It's true that the series has just 12 episodes, but maybe it would have been better had the makers used a bit of the abundant fanservice time to give some believability to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8\\n\r\nLet's face it, all of us saw the ecchi tag as we checked in, so there's no use whining about the plentiful shots of uncensored boobs or panties. If you go prepared for tons of fanservice, you might actually enjoy this show. For myself, I actually don't mind a bit of titillation as long as there's a story to back it up; to its credit, High School DxD does a tolerable job of making the ecchi a story element. Yes, it sometimes gets boring, all that oppai, but the story just about covers it up.\\n\\n\r\nSo let me summarize: If you're going in expecting an ecchi with a story covering it, this will do the job. If you are expecting a story with some ecchi covering it, you'll be disappointed. If you're not into fanservice, try not even to think of watching this.\\n\\n\r\nHope this helps!!",

            "content": "Note: This review is aimed at people who generally don't care much for the Harem/Ecchi genre. If you love the genre, this will be one of your favorite shows.\r\nTo give a general idea of my tastes in Anime know this. Harem/Ecchi is NEVER my favorite. In fact, more often than not, it will make me give it a lower score because of how unnecessary it is. With that being said, I STILL give this show an 8 and believe it is worth watching!\r\nIf nudity bothers you just stop reading. This show is not for you. This show has a HUGE amount of Nudity. But thedesign of the Characters make it great.\\n\\n\r\nNow to answer the question. Is this show worth watching or not?\\n\\n\r\nThis show is superb in many aspects but at the same time awful in others. You have the typical cliche start where the main character is a pervert and seeks his own harem. But wait, he isn't just any pervert, he is a SUPER pervert. The depths at which this guy fantasizes about anything and all things perverted, is nothing short of astonishing. The depths of his perversion in and of itself is at such a high level, where it actually becomes funny. The type of funny that makes you face palm and think to yourself, \"is this kid for real?\" \\n\r\nThe cliche opening doesn't stop there! The main character, woe and behold, has a special power! Stuff happens and he ends up as a servant to a Demon.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the biggest highlights of this show:\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\r\nThe setting. The world is basically divided into 3 Angels, Archangels, Demons. These factions constantly having skirmishes. The dynamics between how these 3 factions interact with each other is very interesting. (In the future, the Author would be able to do a TON more with this concept.) \\n\\n\r\nThe battles. In this show, when Demon's take up \"Servants,\" they assign a chess piece to that person. Each piece enhancing certain powers of that individual. Just like in chess, they can only have a certain amount of a specific piece type. The battles themselves are enhances because of this concept.\\n\\n\r\nThe Comedy. Normally, I am not a huge fan of the \"accidentally walk into bathroom and see naked girl\" type of comedy. However, the perversion of this main character makes it absolutely hilarious. But it doesn't stop there. Instead of the typical female reaction of being embarrassed and mad, the women ENCOURAGE it! The constant struggle between these women practically opening their legs for the main character and the main character's humongous perversion and simultaneous cowardliness, is extremely entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\nThe extreme amounts of Nudity. Seriously, if you can't stand Nudity, don't watch this show.\\n\\n\r\nCliche Harem where all the women fall in love with Main Character. (Although at least there is a valid reason unlike many other Harems.)",

The plot summary first got me intrigued and it rarely disappointed me; it'll be easier just to read the summary rather than me re-typing it here.  The magic powers shown are always cool to watch.  They don't feel like a copy and paste from another source.  Each main character has their own ability too so you're off put by duplicate abilities. Some of the beginning episodes could be a little better and don't seem completely necessary, but they were still fun to watch.\r\nI've always been satisfiedby the cast of characters. It never felt like someone was just there for no reason.  They're good at team work.  Even though Issei is a big pervert, he doesn't give up easily and he wants to protect and serve Rias well.  Everyone else seems to share his determination, but it's more surprising that a huge pervert has that quality.  Koneko is my favorite character from the show.  Just like with the story, if you're interested, watch it and find out more character information for yourself; there's no point in giving everything away in the review.  \\n\\n\r\nThe ecchi is amazing too.  I didn't watch it for that aspect, but a lot of is there for those who want it.  It's not accidental stuff like in so many other harems either.  Despite how much ecchi is shown, I feel that there's a huge amount of story plot to match it.  I'd say story and ecchi are about 50/50, but you probably get that feeling until you watch all three seasons like I have.  \\n\\n\r\nAs always, the decision to watch this or pass it up is on you.  If anything I brought up makes you want to watch it, enjoy the ride.  \\n",

One day while he and his friends are talking underneath the window of the Occult Studies Clubhouse, the main heroine, Rias Gremory, opens the window and looks into the surrounding area, and eventually settles her eyes on Issei, who is captivated by her beauty. He then is asked out by a girl, who in the end, after a lovely date, turns into a fallen angel and kills him.

He also finds out that he is a wielder of the one of the first True Longinus: Boosted Gear, which gives the wielder the ability to destroy even a god for 10 seconds.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime continues with how he adapts to his new lifestyle and his ability to better himself with the Boosted Gear, he even vows to become a harem king. The Specials are nothing but fan-service, so unless you want a hard-on or something, I suggest not watching them or even counting them as a part of the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nMy last comment on this anime is that the plot is decent, the art is good but perverse (no complaints really), sound is good. the characters are enjoyable, and enjoyment is very good. My overall grade for this anime is 9/10",

I dont think this is bad at all, a little fanserve (or alot as the case may be) never hurt anybody. There is so much fanservice that you dont even have to wait 3 minutes from the start tosee a tit, or another 2 after that before there is a nude shower scene! \\n\r\nThis show has a great story, it follows a guy with an innate special fighting ability and a devil woman who is saved him from death and is his primary love interest in the series. There is an interesting concept in the rating game that is used in the show-it is using people for chess pieces and duking it out.\\n\r\nThis show also has alot of action, way more than I planned on in fact, the fights actually lasted more than 30 seconds! The fights were actually interesting and relevant to the story, which is almost never the case in a show like this. \\n\r\nIt was also a very sweet story of romance obviously centered around the two people ive mentioned previously, and the way it ends should put a smile on anybody's face. \\n\r\nThe art was fantastic, the characters were very well designed, the scenery was very good, and the fights were as previously mentioned  very well done.\\n\r\nThe characters were alot of fun.\\n\r\n Rias Gremory is a high ranking devil and the rest of the characters I talk about are her slaves, meaning that she saved them from death and now they are her underlings, not like whips and chains slaves. Rias has this one power where she heals any wound simply by sleeping with someone... in the nude... I suddenly want to break a few limbs. Issei is the protagonist of this show, he is a perv with a great power(funny how much these traits seem to intertwine) and he is in love with Rias. Akeno is Rias' right hand as it were, and theres not much to say about her other than that she is a lightning wielding sadist, which is awesome. Asia (not the continent) is an exorcist turned devil who has insane healing abilities, although personally I would rather get Rias' treatment. Kiba is a the very attractive male knight, and Koneko is the shows loli catgirl who also happens to be jacked. It is a very dynamic group of characters and they each bring their own unique attributes to the table.\\n\r\nLike I said before, i'd give this a 10 for sheer enjoyment alone, however every part of this was good enough that I feel that  I felt any lower score wouldnt do it justice.",

            "content": "Within the anime industry, the Ecchii genre has always been the most controversial genre that you can find with anime and for good reasons too. It features stories that contain girls in their most stereotypical fashion, having them wear skimpy clothing, showing off some ridiculous pairs of breasts, panty-shots, bikinis, etc. The Ecchii genre loves to show off a needless amount of fanservice and perverse comedy in order to cast a humungous shadow over the obvious conventions of a show, which are the characters and the plot (obviously I mean \u201cstory\u201d). But what happens when a series within a genre such as this manages toprove itself worthy of being entertaining in its comedy, characters and action while also containing a story and world that is actually somewhat plausible and interesting? Well, you end up getting an anime known as High School DxD, or what I would like to call, the king of the Ecchii genre.\\n\\n\r\n     High School DxD is a 2012 anime based on a series of light novels by Ichiei Ishibumi. The presentation of DxD is pretty much something that is common in all of Ecchii anime. The protagonist of the story, Issei Hyoudou, is an overly-perverted everyday high school student who hangs out with his equally-perverted best friends. The only thing that Issei longs for in the world is a girlfriend for him to date and feel all over. One day, his wish is granted in the form of a young and beautiful girl that proclaims her love for him. As the two begin to date, Issei feels as though he is truly blessed by this girl that he is dating. That is, until one day during a date, the girl kills Issei and reveals herself to be a fallen-angel who was ordered by an organization to spy on and kill Issei, who just so happens to contain the potential and power to kill fallen-angel, while at the same time, a high school girl known as Rias Gremory defeats the girl and saving Issei\u2019s life in the process by bringing him back to life since she turns out to be a powerful demon\u2026\u2026\u2026.like I said, a pretty common presentation within Ecchii shows. Surprisingly, however, the story of this anime is very coherent and has some of the most entertaining moments and characters that I\u2019ve seen in anime.\\n\\n\r\n     The strength of DxD\u2019s story doesn\u2019t come from its presentation, but rather its world and supporting cast of characters. I mean it when I say that DxD has a very intriguing and understandable universe and world-building. The world of DxD is one filled with multiple mythologies and religions, such as Christianity or Norse, all bundled into one big war. Issei just so happens to be thrown smack-dab into the middle of this war thanks to Rias Gremory, who runs a secret organization of demons who also attend to Issei\u2019s school. Everyone, from the sadistic and hilariously mysterious Lightning Queen Akeno to the very calm and charming blonde boy Kiba, is hilarious and unique, thanks to their backstories and powers that they use in various action sequences of the show. Speaking of the action in the show, I must say that it is surprisingly fun to watch and contains moments of badassness and drama. Because of the many religions and mythologies of the show, you get to experience some very epic fights against demons, nightmarish animals, angels, priests, and even some gods. Basically what I\u2019m trying to say is that the world and the characters of DxD are grandeur and incredibly interesting, even for an Echhii anime.\\n\\n\r\n     What is also shocking about DxD are the moments of fanservice. Not only is the fanservice laugh-out-loud hilarious but it is also in relation to the story and character moments. Weird right? DxD\u2019s fanservice is much like the fanservice in other Ecchii anime, with its fair shair of titties and ass and what not. However, the anime also manages to make these perverted moments pretty damn memorable and honest-to-God important to the storyline. I found this to be very impressive within such a stereotypical genre because it is something that you do not typically see in Echii shows. DxD proves itself to be something that is \u201cspecial\u201d or \u201cnew\u201d for this type of genre and gives you hope for more anime that may possibly use this format and thinking when it comes to comedy and story. \\n\\n\r\n     Overall, there\u2019s not too much to say about DxD other than it is both your common and not common Ecchii anime. Sure, it has its fair share of stupid fanservice moments full of perversion and the like, however, it does something that you rarely see in the Ecchii genre, which is conveying a story and world that makes you want to watch more. The mixture of different mythologies, religion and history turns out to be brilliantly epic and dramatic, even when the show has its comedic moments. The protagonist Issei is also entertainingly different from other Ecchii protagonists because of the fact that you actually experience some development and changes that his character goes through over the time of the first season. Because of these surprising changes and moments that differ from an average Echhii comedy, High School DxD is worthy enough of being labeled as \u201cdifferent\u201d and \u201cfresh\u201d to those who both love the Ecchii genre and hate the genre. DxD is definitely worth your time if you have been searching long and hard for an Ecchii anime that isn\u2019t just about the fanservice. \\n",

(I have NO knowledge of the Light Novels)\r\nThings To Know Before Starting This Series:\r\n-This show is funny and is not an anime the needs to take all to seriously. Don't start watching this series looking for a deep meaningful plot, it has a pretty generic and predictable storyline. But nevertheless it is still very enjoyable.\r\n- AS A GIRL, the amount of boobs in this anime sometimes did feel a little ridiculousand got kind of annoying at some points but after a few episodes, I got used to it, Realizing the boobs add to the comedic aspect. For boys, the boobs should not be that big of a problem. \\n\r\n-If your a sensitive person or a person that is easily bothered/offended by crude and or sexual humor I would not recommend this anime to you haha\\n\r\n-All women in this anime aside, The two male characters Issei and Kiba are enjoyable characters as well. The show mainly focusing on Main Protaginist Issei and his perverted yet comedic personality which adds enjoyment to the series for all watchers. Well keeping a keeping a serious vibe at the same time, especially whenever his powers are demonstrated mainly because it makes you eager to see him grow more powerful as a Demon\\n\\n\r\nAll in All I would Recommend this Anime, its One of Those series that gets more enjoyable the more you watch. I praise this anime more or so for its comedy and ability to make me laugh, but yet still having and enjoyable story despite is generic aspects. I look forward to watching the next two seasons.\\n",

            "content": "One of the best ecchi anime's ever devised. Well, at least considering the ecchi part. This one should NOT be viewed with family members nearby in anyway because of its content. (I had to learn that the hard way lol) An incredible amount of tits, boobs, ass, more tits, and pantie shots are shown very frequently in here. So I advise that if you can't enjoy the story because of it's constant nudity and fan-service then by all means avoid it and watch something different. Onto the review:\r\nSTORY: 6\r\nStarts out a bit weak but later grows potential to be amazing. Great thing is it doestake advantage of that potential, but only to be cut off because of the lack of time and episodes. You see the main kid as nothing more than a perverted shit who probably masturbates more than he does studying. Then he's introduced to a fake girlfriend, a big titted president, a shy nun (who is adorable), a pretty boy ( mmm you've got a purtty mouth), a vertically challenged super strengthened midget washboard, a sadistic bitch (she probably fantasizes about how she could go about zapping your genitalia), and an up-class faggot ass douche nozzle elitist as an antagonist. After the introduction of said characters you see what was a horndog now become a man with balls of steel. As boring as this may sound the way the developers executed this was what made it interesting enough to hold your attention for the brief amount of time the show had. Their method? Using an extreme excess of fan-service rather than plot development. With this strategy, your left with burning questions that result in confusion and frustration. What are the motivations of the three factions? You've got the Angels,  Fallen Angels,  and Devils. But why are the fallen angels and devils on such bad terms? Going so far as to killing each other? Don't they both serve Lucifer? What ever happened to \"the enemy of my enemy is my friend\"? Why wasn't the angel faction introduced? No insight was given at all abut them let alone at least introducing a brief scene of them. Why do devils appear good and honorable? Aren't they called devils for a reason? You know slaughtering mean sons of bitches? Mercilessness sadistic cruel entities that via to destroy you? Even tho I found this bothersome I still was able to enjoy the dose of tits, blood, and of course profanity Highschool DXD provides. I find it more appealing that if I don't give you a whole run-down of what to expect you'd be enjoying it a whole lot more than if I did. Otherwise you might just end up dropping it or avoiding it. As bad as this sounds it still proves it is worthy of at least half your time. And as much as there was an excess of tit in here I see the continuation of the incomplete story that can blossom through a second season. (And hopefully answer who, what, when, where, why, and how about the three factions)\\n\\n\r\nART: 10\\n\r\nPersonally I loved the way the characters were drawn. The detail was carefully well done from the blood and guts to the tits and ass.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8\\n\r\nThe music sounded very classy for a ecchi anime. I enjoy classical music so it was a delight to hear it. Surprisingly it also fit the action scenes very well. The voices were very well done as well as the sound effects such as explosions and magic. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 5\\n\r\nI've seen a shitton of character development become wasted in many anime's. *cough* Kanokon *cough* And after evaluating each character carefully, from Asia to Koneko, I can conclude that there was not enough time (or episodes for that matter) to give in a nice full insight of each character. Issei was about the only character that had true development if any. Everyone else seemed more like a bystander or support character to me. Including Rias, which was a huge disappointment. I'll explain why:\\n\\n\r\nAsia Argento: Ah! The timid and honest, perfectly innocent cutesy personality is given to such a beautifully well drawn character. What are her aspects? Just as I described. She's a bit shy, with the Goody Two-Shoes act and God fearing trait. She is affiliated with the fallen angle faction and is later reborn as a low-class devil (Former human)/Bishop recruited by a duke of hell known as Rias Gremory. (Ain't that a surprise?) If you found that surprising than you have very poor foretelling skills. (Saw that a mile away man no way is it a spoiler) With her twilight healing the only thing that DOESN'T make her useless as many other characters I could name from other anime's *looks at Kazumi Yoshida* that was about as much character development you're going to get from her. Now I can give the developers a great way in exploiting her personality. And I'll do just that. Avoiding the typical evolve her power from healing to super healing abilities! TWIST IT. Twist it as if your playing Twister. Make her a TRUE demonic demon who goes from the happy go lucky Asia to the cynical blood thirsty type who'd tear you piece by piece. Let her evolve into that after witnessing a traumatic event. Such as a fellow comrade falling into a life or death situation. (Use Issei for obvious reasons) Only to revert to her \"normal\" self after the situation calms down.\\n\\n\r\nRias Gremory: Here's my problem, the description in MAL explains perfectly of what and who she is. And the character development didn't help any in the 1st (hopefully not last) season. You see what she is here? Absolute no significant change that is worth mentioning in my review. If I were to say the ONLY change in her development it would cause a (minor) spoiler that would leave many who cannot see the obvious miffed. And my review here is aimed to help you decide whether it is worth your time to watch the anime in question. When I say you, I mean ALL of you regardless if you are young, dumb, or full of cum. So those of you who know what her development is, I say hope that the second season gives a shit more of development for her than what we have received in the first. (Last episode completely shows her only development) Those of you that cannot see the obvious, refer to Sora no Otoshimono and compare our main male protagonist here with the one over there. Now notice the change in attitude toward the main male lead of the female protagonists in Sora and compare it with Highschool. What can you draw with these similarities given that both main males are extremely perverted with many \"hot\" chicks surrounding them? What can you predict on how the female leads will react with the male leads now that they have become men with balls of steel? Bingo. ;D\\n\\n\r\nAkeno Himejima: Should be considered as supporting. Little to no insight/background given whatsoever. Description in MAL provides everything you need to know about her. \\n\\n\r\nIssei Hyoudou: \"An 11th grade student. Stupid, lecherous and a pervert. A normal high school student born in a normal family, but is in the possession of the Sacred Gear \"Boosted Gear\" which is listed as one of the ultimate Sacred Gears. He was killed by his then girlfriend who was a fallen-angel; later on was revived as a devil, becoming the servant of Rias Gremory. His new master. Now he aims to become a Harem-king by gaining a peerage, unaware of himself attracting the very girls around him.\" Perfectly given. So how about the way they executed this? Of course the typical cliche way of introducing a near impossible obstacle only to be overcame by a miraculous event such as taking advantage of his Boosted Gear and learning its abilities and advantages. Still very perverted, he gives meaning to \"character development\" in Highschool DXD's first season. He becomes a man that is comparable to Duke Nukem. (Without the shit one-liners thank God) The similarities? Well, none really other than a shitton of hot chicks surrounding him. Actually now that I think about it would you say Duke Nukem is the American version of a Japanese harem? Anyways you will see this kid grow the balls to announce to the world (and antagonist) SPOILER,,\u0279\u0131\u0250s,s \u028c\u0131\u0279\u0183\u0131u\u0131\u0287\u028e \u0131s WIN\u018e\u00a1,, END OF SPOILER. Google upside down text and enter it there if you'd like to see the spoiler. Concerning his aspects, it shouldn't be much of a surprise he'd do such a thing. But nonetheless you can perfectly notice how such a wimpy dog becomes a howling wolf. \\n\\n\r\nYuuto Kiba: Should be considered as supporting. Little to no insight/background given whatsoever. Description in MAL provides everything you need to know about him. \\n\\n\r\nKoneko Toujou: Should be considered as supporting. Little to no insight/background given whatsoever. Description in MAL provides everything you need to know about her. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7\\n\r\nAs much as I wish there was less fan-service and more plot/character development it was still great to see a great amount of blood spewing scenes and dramatic twist of events in the last few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7\\n\r\nIf your looking for a nice alternative to Sora no Otoshimono then Highschool DXD just might fit your expectations. Don't expect much from an ecchi anime that puts the \"ecchi\" in anime such as Highschool DXD, but know that this anime is still open to a second season that could blast you off to God knows where. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Highschool DxD is my first ever anime so it held really high in nostalgic value. It is the reason why I start loving anime so much. Therefore, in order to celebrate its new installment in April, I decided to write a review about favorite ecchi show of all time.\r\nP/s: Keep in my mind, this is my first ever review so I may be bias in this review.\r\nHighschool DxD ususally really popular for its nudity and perverted attitude. The amount of boobies and panty shots in this anime can be considered offended by some people. However, this is one of the strongest point of highschool DxD,with it can create a lot of hilarious and boner moments. If you don\u2019t like constant heavy ecchi elements in your face even while the serious or dramatic moments, then this is not your cup of tea.\\n\r\nHighschool DxD is also one of the heaviest ecchi show that actually has a good plot (at least imo). The key to this is that it doesn\u2019t not take itself too seriously. The plot is not too simple or complicated. It\u2019s not so irrelevant that it just get thrown in for the sack of plot or heavily depend on it to the point of plain silliness or confusing as hell (main offenders being Seikon no qwaser, Maken-ki and Dakara Boku wa, H ga Dekinai). You still feel the idea of progression in the story even though it\u2019s not much. The story only consists of two acts according to two volumes that are adapted. Thus, there is no rushing and you do feel the character development of some of the main casts.\\n\r\nThe character are very lovable and memorable. Considering they are kind of stereotypical at first, TNK does know how to make them stand out in the crown of other ecchi anime character. (TNK can finally stand on their own after the abomination called \u201cSchool day\u201d, thank god).\\n\r\nWe have the main casts as follow:\\n\r\nHyoudou Issei: A typical pervert main protagonist who finally has some characterizations, awesome power and badass moments under his sleeve besides from his perversion.\\n\r\nRias Greymory: Your typical club president with a strong determination and strength under those marvelous curves of hers. (She is the one to awake my red hair fetish btw)\\n\r\nAkeno Himejima: Your typical pervert vice-president with a strange fetish of S and M at the same time. (btw her Japanese voice is perfect and far more superior than the English dub)\\n\r\nKoneko Toujou: Your typical Kuudere loli type of girl. \\n\r\nAsia Argento: Your typical closest girl to main character who has an obvious crush on the main guy. \\n\r\nYuuto Kiba: Your typical 180 opposite guy to the main protagonist.\\n\r\nAll of the characters have their own past and different development throughout the show, with some get to show off, some don\u2019t (At least for now), they all very lovable so character wise should not disappoint you at all.\\n\r\nHighschool DxD\u2019s art is good in my opinion, the girls look awesome, and the scenes look good in general. However, the action scene could use some more of the special effects, but I digress. It looks good overall, and did I mention that they do an omega good job on the boobs\u2019 movement and panty shots. This is one of small amount of ecchi anime can give you a boner while watching the action scene. Yeah, I know, it\u2019s that good.\\n\r\nThe OST is also a great point for this anime, probably the highest portion that Highschool DxD can get in most review. The OST is overall amazing with a lot memorable songs such as Tsumari wa, Oppai desu; Watashi no tame ni, Ikinasai and Utsukushiku, Akai... They are all amazing and really add on to the overall atmosphere of the show rather than merely complement the scence. The OP Trip -innocent of D- is also amazing on its own which make it impossible to skip the OP sequence whether I rewatch the show (and believe me that happens a lot).\\n\r\nIn the end, my personal enjoyment was off the chart by the time I finished it. I make me realize how great Anime is and enslave me to become its fan immediately. It is just a good ecchi anime in general. It does not has the greatest animation like Fate/Zero or an amazing plot like Code-Geass, but until today it is my favorite ecchi anime series of all time. It\u2019s a great piece of entertainment which require us, the viewer to turn our brain off and enjoy the show its greatest potential. I highly recommended this show to any ecchi fan or fan in general who just want a pure entertaining time in the weekend. \\n",

            "content": "Issei is a regular high school student. He attends classes, hangs out with friends, and obsesses over girls. In fact his obsession of more of a sick perversion. What he doesn\u2019t realize is that there is a war brewing. A war between Heaven and Hell and before he knows it, Issei gets caught up in the middle of it. When a near-death experience causes him to end up on the side of the Devils, Issei must now adjust to his new life while at the same time trying to please his busty and beautiful Devil Mistress.\r\n With taglines such as \u201cPunctuated With Boobs\u201d & \u201cFueledby the Fires of Perversion!\u201d, it shouldn\u2019t come to anyone\u2019s surprise that Highschool DxD is a very Mature rated anime. The Anime is full of fan service \u2013 with every female character ending up naked at one point or another throughout the series \u2013 and it has a lot of American Pie style perverse humor with the main character, Issei, talking about \u201cwhacking it\u201d or calling breasts \u201cfun pillows\u201d and the like. However this only serves as the show\u2019s main source of humor. Past the nudity, there is a legitimate storyline that is surprisingly deep and well written.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall storyline is as follows: High school student Issei is attacked by a Fallen Angel and nearly killed. He is rescued by an upper classmate, the beautiful red-headed Rias. It is revealed that Rias is a member of the Gremory family \u2013 a family of Elite, Pure-Blooded Devils. Rias saves Issei\u2019s life by turning him into a Devil like herself. The rest of the Anime revolves around Issei getting used to his new life as a Devil as well as trying to prove himself worthy to Rias.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that really stood out for me with this anime was the characters. I honestly expected many of the characters to fall into the cliches that I\u2019ve seen with other ecchi (sexual) anime but luckily that was not the case. I did not expect Issei to become a genuinely loving, protective, and compassionate individual. Even though there are moments where he is distracted by breasts, he never lets that get in his way as he fights for the safety of those he cares about.\\n\\n\r\nOn the same token, the story isn\u2019t some played out love-drama where several female characters are all fighting for Issei\u2019s affection. There are only two women in the series who are interested in Issei but they do not let their feelings get in the way of their lives. They do not obsess about him nor fight one another for Issei\u2019s affection. It is a nice change of pace from those other anime where we suffer through nine beautiful women who are all falling over one another for one boys attention.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline itself is split into two distinct arcs. The first arc revolves around Issei\u2019s membership into the Devils and the trials he must go through to help those he cares about. The second arc surrounds Rias and her ties with another Devil family. Both of these arcs last between 3-4 episodes. The episodes in between act as both filler and character development \u2013 none of which drag the series down or bore the audience. These episodes help build the characters\u2019 relationships with one another while at the same time providing Issei some time to train and grow as a devil.",

            "content": "When people mention Highschool DxD, it is usually referenced as a harem / ecchi anime... and while it does have those elements, Highschool DxD manages to be more than the sum of it's parts and transforms into something truly special. \r\nIssei Hyoudou is an ordinary teenager who happens to be bad with the ladies. He and his friends spend time watching the girls do P.E. and fantasize about having a girlfriend. As Issei is contemplating his plight of being dateless... suddenly a beautiful girl, Yuuma Amano, asks him on a date! To which he emphatically, if cautiously, accepts. He takes her around the town, takesher to dinner and finally they are alone in the park. Finally Issei is going to get what he always wanted..... or.... not. \\n\\n\r\nThe set up to this show is flawless. I do also have to mention the music. It is so damn epic and fits the scene perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I will admit... this anime does have nudity and boobs. Lots of boobs. BUT... it is usually pretty restrained and doesn't go TOO overboard. It manages to walk a fine line like no anime I have seen before. It actually managed to compliment the story, unlike some anime. If you can't handle a little naked female... then look elsewhere for an anime.\\n\\n\r\nIssei's powers.... These have got to be the most awesome and at the same time HILARIOUS powers I have ever seen of any character ever. His \"DRESS BREAK\" is just incredible... the tactical advantage of this move is immense. The perverted responses are just too much. I was left having to pause because I was laughing so hard.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters... Rias and Akano are my two favorite anime heroines, hands down. It isn't just because they both have the biggest boobs of any other character... but their personalities. That also isn't to say I don't like the other females in the group either. Koneko doesn't add much sexual tension like the first two, but she adds hilarious comic relief through her ridiculous strength and cold and merciless demeanor when Issei does something perverted. Asia is also a truly likable character. Again, not there for sexual tension... just there to be adorable and add some opposite comedy to Koneko. Asia is sweet, innocent and nice. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Highschool DxD is a masterpiece. I realize how this series is seen by the slack jawed mouth breathers who focus on the fact that it has some nudity over anything else and then pronounce themselves as \"better\" because they call anything with nudity as beneath them... but really it changes nothing. This series is awesome and deserves your viewing. \\n\\n\r\n\"BOOST!\"\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: Nothing too complex... but it manages to hit all of its notes with excellent precision. This is the perfect blend of comedy, romance and action elements.\\n\\n\r\nART: The animation is top notch. Really quite amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Love it. Simply love it. The epic and amazing music makes me watch to buy the soundtrack. Seriously. Its that good.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: The best part of the series. Issei is one of my favorite male MCs. The main cast is all fun and likable. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Very high.\\n\\n\r\nREWATCHABILITY: High. I've watched this series a few times and I even bought it on Blu-Ray. Well worth it.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: An incredible anime that is more than the sum of its parts. It manages to be a lot of things and it does them all brilliantly. Virtus Signum gives this a 10/10.",

May I present to u High School DxD\r\nStory-8 \r\nFor a typical harem like this, the story isn't all too interesting. Obviously for first timers, this would seem either fascinating or awkward, depending on your mood for ecchi romance. But how they develop the story is what I like. The beginning is a very unusual event,starting with the death of the main character. But he is reincarnated as a devil and assigned to a chess piece, receiving special abilities. He is now a slave working under a woman, a woman he begins to fall in love with. Through training and events, they develop feelings with each other. However, she had been previously engaged with another demon from a different clan. And she, having no interest in him from the beginning, is forced to succumb to his will after a battle between their clans. And as their engagement party takes place, the main character runs in to save his master and is given the decision to fight against him. Using smart tactics, being able to exploit weaknesses to demons, he defeated the \"who was to be immortal\" antagonist. And so lived a happily ever after.\\n\\n\r\nArt-9\\n\r\nAlthough the anime does not cover a whole lot on demonic abilities and what not, the art is great. They arent the average demons you would expect them to be. The power effects are pretty sweet. Of course, will power is what makes their power surpass their own limits. As for the characters, I've developed a fetish for radiant colors of long hairs on women. They fight in their school clothes, which is a little disappointing, but their demonic powers covers up for it. The only person who changes their clothes during fights is akeno himejime. \\n\\n\r\nSound-8\\n\r\nI havent paid too much attention on sounds and music other than the openings and endings. I find the opening particularly interesting because it sets a mood for action and romance. I'd personally think it's a great DDR or osu song. So definitely try it out\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 9\\n\r\nThis is a big plus for high school dxd. We learn the type of characters they are, and what special abilities are given to them. While the main character may be a pervert, the club respects his talents and develop a huge interest in him. Rias is smart, strong willed, and seductive to issei. Akeno is a sadist who also develops feelings towards issei, but allows rias to be with him since she is her superior and friend. Among the others is a pretty boy with great swordsmanship skills and a quiet, yet ridiculously strong little girl who also likes issei, although she hates him for being a huge pervert. I'm glad they were able to make a romantic comedy with these characters. It helps to lighten up the mood\\n\\n\r\nOverall/enjoyment-8\\n\r\nWhile high school lacks creativity in story and a little overboard with ecchi, it still is a great romantic comedic action anime to watch. The characters are well done, and provide a great contribution to the development of the anime. To be honest, this anime is overrated, and that has to do with the ecchi in this anime. Naked boobs are shown as well as their bodies without revealing in between their legs, but that seems to be enough to attract lots of guys. Please take into consideration that I am not recommending this anime for its slight usage of pornography, but rather for the action and romance involved. This isn't the anime where'd u to \"hey look, boobs\" and start to watch. Sure, it can be entertaining. And I won't lie that I like seeing nude bodies. I just feel that this anime should receive more recognition for its character development and art.",

            "content": "First off, let me say that this is my first review so please keep that in mind and  feel free to contact me about what I should improve and what was done well. \r\nBasically if you don't like demons, angels, supernatural and fighting then this is nothing for you, also this story is ecchi so you are warned.\r\nSomething I would like to mention as well, this review is SPOILER FREE, I am expected to let you know whether you should watch this anime or not, not to spoil anything for you.\r\nAfter having watched this show twice and read some of the light novels, Ithought it would be time to write a review, so lets do this. \\n\\n\r\nStory: For me personally, the story had me interested right from the start, I have a weak spot for angels, devils and all that is associated with them.\\n\r\nI didn't read a review about Highschool DxD as I simply stumbled upon it because of a typo on google but it is probably 1 of the best mistakes I made in my life. \\n\\n\r\nIt has action, it has well made fight scenes and the romance gets interesting as the story progresses. The anime sticks close to the LN and I can say that it stays over 90% true to it, it only covers LN 1 and 2, so if you want to know how the story goes after the anime, read the LN as there are 12 at the moment. \\n\\n\r\nNow, what they did well with the anime was that they explained everything very well and only when the situation asked for it, so no massive amount of information at once that blows your mind into 100 pieces and you have no idea what is happening, another point where this anime scores well with, is that even though it is very ecchi, it isn't done over the top and not like other animes, that they did it at the most random moments, it is mixed well with the story and what surprised me most is that, sometimes they even have their reason to be that ecchi with the main protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nAnother point that I would like to let you know: Highschool DxD uses a lot of Norse, Japanese and Greek Mythologies, it would be useful if you know something about them but if not, don't worry as everything will be explained as the story progresses.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The anime is well made concerning art, the background is accurately made and the character design is nothing unique, but nonetheless well done as their is no weird face design, nor are there characters with physics breaking hairstyles.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Personally I enjoyed the opening theme, in fact I even downloaded it. The ending theme is lets say...interesting, the animation that goes with the themes go well with what kind of atmosphere this anime has and probably simply to joke around as most people would have thought at the beginning of the anime that it would be as ecchi as it could get.\\n\\n\r\nWhere my 9 is based on mostly, is that the BGM is absolutely top notch, fighting scenes have a truly amazing tune that will get you all fired up, and romantic scenes have a well fitting tune as well, believe me when I say that if you would look for a playlist with them, that you won't regret it. It is truly well done and the composer is a genius in my opinion. another point, the BGM isn't repeated over and over again, almost every scene has it's own piece of music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Here is where Highschool DxD scores amazingly well, my opinion might be slightly biased as I read up to LN 5 and the character development is astonishing, the depth that the characters are described is amazing and something that I have never seen before, but don't get me wrong here, the characters in the anime have their fair squire of development already.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's go a bit into more into detail;\\n\\n\r\nIssei Hyoudou: Our perverted main protagonist who gets killed on his 1st date, quite sad actually, not knowing that his master would be Rias(buchou) and will revive him as a devil because he has a 'sacred gear' that could even kill gods. I won't go too much into detail as it would spoil things and that's not what a review should do.\\n\\n\r\nRias Gremory: The sweethearted, beautiful and 1 of 2 the school's 'onee-samas,' 1st in line to become the next head of the Gremory household, kind hearted to her 'slaves' but when someone makes fun of them or during training she changes into an absolute tsundere and will put herself to her limit.\\n\\n\r\nAsia Argento: The kindhearted, blonde nun that will undergo absolute change if you read the LN..absolutely hilarious scenes will happen because of this, believe me. \\n\\n\r\nAkeno Himejima: The other half of the 'onee-samas' and a complete sadist, also called the 'priestess of lightning.' She doesn't undergo any development through the anime though, but she certainly has her comedic part in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nYuuto Kiba: The 'prince of the high school' and seems to enjoy to annoy Ise by being too close to him, because of his good looks he is hated by Ise.\\n\\n\r\nKoneko Toujou: The loli in this anime, is the idol of the school because of her tiny body and cute looks, doesn't talk a lot but when she does say something, it is generally to say something when Ise did something perverted. \\n\\n\r\nThe many supporting characters certainly add to the story and give a comedic breeze to the anime, all in all every character has his own contribution to the story and anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I certainly enjoyed this anime and will watch this anime for a 3rd time for sure. It has a high re-watch value and actually an anime that every single person should have watched, or read the LN. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: No matter what you are into, harem, ecchi, action, supernatural, it has something for you.\\n\\n\r\nSo stop reading and go watch it, and when you are done go read the LN, it will entertain you till the last bit.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading and please, as I stated at the beginning: let me know what I did well and what I should improve.",

            "content": "If you are able to look past all the fan service, the story of this anime is actually pretty damn good! Although calling this fan service is an understatement. Everybody is either full nude or show a nipple like half the time. This anime is full of majestic, in-your-face \"plot\", where one could call it borderline porn. Although lot of times I just couldn't help but laugh over it because it's just so mucu.\r\nEven in the 2nd season, I knew there was going to be countless amount of nude scenes and I expected them, but sometimes they still just caught me off guard and mademe laugh (note to self: also a viable drinking game). Most of the times it went kinda like this: \"Okay, I bet now her clothes will be shredded and all that remains are panties in some embarrassing pose... Goddamn it, not even panties and an even more embarrassing pose, LMAO!\"\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very weak, but the story makes up for everything. This anime made me laugh and it almost managed to make me even cry. There are some really touching moments. This anime probably would have a better reputation without all the boobs.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is a totally pathetic pervert. He becomes demon slave to one of the high-level demons. Turns out he has some god killing weapon sealed in his body. He's wound up in a war between angels, demons, priests and whatnot as he struggles to unlock the potential of his weapon. The jokes they try to make with the pervy main character are... eh, pathetic. There's no other way to say it. BUT it does get a lot better in the 2nd season. The creators learned to this perverseness to make some fun jokes. If you watched this, be sure to watch the 2nd season, it's a lot better in general. \\n\\n\r\nThe narrative however doesn't outright highlight demons as evil. Rather, it shows the faults in angels, priests as well as the demons, which is a nice area to explore.",

            "content": "There\u2019s an art to the ecchi genre. Sexual appeal may not require brains to react to, but it requires skill. Not everyone can be a stripper or a sexy dancer even if you have the right body. A good ecchi show would know symbolism and psychology aren\u2019t part of the genre. It would know that it uses sexuality and energy to tell a fun, ridiculous story. High School DXD knows this, but doesn\u2019t work on it.\r\nThe characters embodies the strengths and the weaknesses. Rias is worth all the hype and posters they made. You need more than big breasts to make a sexy character. Riasis sexy and not just because of her figure (which isn\u2019t easy to design. See also: Divergence Eve). It\u2019s also little touches like the hair, which is deliberately red. Red is both the color that attracts the most attention. Rias isn\u2019t just meant to be pretty but she symbolizes sexuality.\\n\\n\r\nHer posture, behavior and personality also help express this idea. She\u2019s not a caricature nymphoniac who\u2019ll be a sex slave for our main character. Rather, she\u2019s comfortable in her sexuality. She doesn\u2019t mind being seen naked. She\u2019s in a position of authority that gives her a lot of power but she\u2019s not drunk with it. Power is sexy, but being able to control it is harder and sexier.\\n\\n\r\nShe\u2019s a charismatic, powerful presence that holds the series despite the fact everyone around her is barely half as interesting. What\u2019s weird is that all the failures are females. They\u2019re supposed to be just as attractive as Rias, but they\u2019re dull.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to see something in them beyond archetypes. Rias was an embodiment of an idea. Everyone else is a dull archetype. Asia is the complete opposite of Rias, which is something. It\u2019s not used to its advantage. The contrast between the two never appears. We know she\u2019s a nice girl but we only know it. We rarely see it happen. Akeno has no personality whatsoever and Koneco is a quiet loli, which was always a terrible idea and doesn\u2019t improve here.\\n\\n\r\nThe designers do have talent. Later in the series a rival group is introduced, and they all have more imaginative designs than the main characters\u2019. It\u2019s almost as if they had two different designers, and the less creative one punished the other. Things in the rivalry team include spiral twintails, X-shaped twintails, a bikini armor and a masked figure. Even at their worst, there\u2019s more spark to their design. Why do the main characters get the generic long hair of Akeno?\\n\\n\r\nThe male characters are actually more entertaining this time. They\u2019re often mindless perverts or boring good guys in such shows. Issei is a combination of both, but it\u2019s one that works. He has these attributes not because it\u2019s convenient to the story but because they can create a personality out of it. Issei becomes both an overblown moral hero who\u2019s just as selfish and horny as the person he goes against.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s irony there. It flips the story where two people beat up each other because they disagree and somehow their strength proves their idea right. I wish the irony was more developed though. Issei knows he\u2019d like to be that asshole he\u2019s fighting, the guy with the harem. The anime doesn\u2019t take a step back to laugh at this, at least not enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that it\u2019s not enough to just know you\u2019re making an ecchi series. You still need direction, you need to aim somewhere. What prevents the series from becoming really enjoyable is its lack of direction. Is this about how stupid but kind of cute we are in high school when hormones drive us crazy? Or is this about a hero that\u2019s going to push himself over the edge for a girl because he\u2019s hungry for sex?\\n\\n\r\nIf the series would\u2019ve chosen to alternate between the two, it would\u2019ve been fine. Instead, it jumps back and forth between the two. It only gets focused at the end, where it sticks to the epic fight and nothing else. At least it\u2019s victorious there. The fight is well-animated and has a pretty enough scenery to make it exciting. The exaggeration of the characters is also believable enough to make the final conflict feel epic enough.\\n\\n\r\nThe fantasy element is one of the good parts. It\u2019s a cute spin on the Devil/Angel dichotomy that doesn\u2019t pretend to be profound. The idea of devils doing services for people is rife for potential comedy. They play around with it a little and then abandon it. The epic battle was fine, but it was more fun to see Issei trying to do things and being a loser. It\u2019s an opportunity to create odd side-characters who can have their ideas summed up in one episode. There are more seasons and I hope they play around with this more.\\n\\n\r\nNow comes the fatal part, where humiliation is passed off for sexiness. I don\u2019t mind the camera finding its way to changing rooms or how clothes get ripped off during battles in sexy ways. What I don\u2019t understand is, is it necessary to have the characters strip others naked against their will for our enjoyment? It\u2019s not sexy and it\u2019s not humorous.\\n\\n\r\nHigh School DXD knows what it isn\u2019t, but it also doesn\u2019t know what it is. There is heart here. These people really wanted to make an anime that will capture the fun spirit Ecchi can have, but they didn\u2019t know how. Maybe the next seasons have more focus. I hope so. Rias is too much of a fun character and Issei is a rare Harem protagonist who actually contributes to the story. It\u2019s a fun show, but as crazy as it sounds I think we can do more with Ecchi.\\n\\n\r\n2.5 devils out of 5",

            "content": "What do you get when you mix fan service and plot? High School DxD!\r\nHigh School DxD is a twelve episode anime produced by studio TNK released in the winter of 2012. \r\nThe anime revolves around high school student and grade A pervert Issei Hyodo. His goal is to become a harem king and after meeting with the crimson haired beauty Rias Gremory could his dreams come true. \r\nStory: \r\nOur main protagonist Issei is a pervert, an open one at that. He dreams of having an array of beautiful girls showering him with attention. After being asked out by a timid girl he soon learns ofthe existence of devils and angels. Upon finding this out the angel attacks him. He would later be healed and made to join Rias Gremory's group of subordinates. \\n\\n\r\nNow prior to my initial thoughts there actually seems to be some semblance of a story. Being a pawn in this scenario Issei is challenge to gather contracts from humans. (for whatever reason I've yet to establish) Issei then makes the goal of becoming a top rank devil which is very slow going. \\n\\n\r\nThe general plot is somewhat overshadowed by the excessive fan service, however its thrown in mainly for parody reasons. High School DxD is a show that can be serious when it wants to be and it also doesn't stray from its comedic and stereotypical harem anime. This anime is not meant to be taken seriously. I can sum it up with it being a fun show to watch. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nIssei Hyodo is our main protagonist. It's abundantly clear from episode one that he is a pervert. He gets involved with friends on spying on the girls changing room. Despite this fact he has a good heart. He demonstrates this time and time again with all the female characters in the show. His shear will power to become the greatest demon is nothing abnormal from most main protagonists who are against the odds, but who knows. The only development I can see from Issei is that he gains a greater lever of power and maybe he'll pick a fucking girl to date! \\n\\n\r\nRias Gremory is our main female protagonist and is the to be head of the Gremory household. She helps Issei out after his altercation with an angel and contracts him to serve the Gremory household. She is the standard set for Issei to beat in terms of power and in general a model demon. She like the many other females in this series wants his... Love? I suppose that'll do. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters include the shy and blond cutie that is Asia. Asia is a former nun renowned for her healing abilities, she is also my joint favourite female in the series. Akeno is the sexy and sadistic goddess of lightning who has definitely got my vote for the best female character along with Asia. Koneko who is the equivalent of many other Kuudere's and lastly Yuto Kiba who doesn't get much screen time until season two. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nThe art is standard. Nothing balls to walls worthy but its good during the battle scenes. Other TNK works I have watched include School days... How the hell did I forget that? \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe sound is god suits the theme of the show, but I've yet to listen to the OST on its own. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\r\nHigh School DxD is an anime that isn't meant to be taken seriously. Its a bit of fun for male anime fans. If you are tired of shows with excessive fan service then you may want to stay clear. Mainly aimed at male audiences so girls you may wanna check out fruit basket instead. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I give High School DxD a 7 out of 10 \\n\\n\r\nAlternate recommendations are High School of the dead, another show which contains excessive amounts of fan service, but with zombies! and another one of TNK's works which is School days... I'd just stick to the former if I were you guys. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading guys, have a nice day! \\n\\n",

However, the anime knows that it isn't meant to be taken too serious and most of the time I just couldn't believe what was happen in it.  However,it is a real simple story as it is, just with a lot of female nudity.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: The art style of the show is actually decent.  It is set in a high school so everyone has to wear a similar uniform but they all do stand out.  Also it is a bit bright at times even when it is supposed to be about demons and other underworld themes, but that just meant be part of the whole \"not taking itself to serious\" thing.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: The sound is also another element that is done well.  The background theme does tell what the main character, Issei, is feeling at most times.  Also the characters' VO does a great job here; you're able to tell what the characters are portraying at the time they are speaking.  The music and other sound doesn't really stand out that much but that might be because they reuse it for both the serious moments and the comedy bits in this show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10: There are a lot of characters here but the main one is Issei Hyoudou.  This maybe a spoiler but it is revealed in like the first five minutes of the first episode so am just going to say it.  Issei is one of the biggest perverts I have ever seen in any anime.  If there was a top 10 list somewhere, I believe he would be at least be ranked 2 or 3.  However, he does show growth throughout the show in a very good sense and he does have some good qualities to him.  The other characters on the other hand they really stay the same.  By the third episode you would get a pretty good idea about the other characters in the show and they don't even have as much growth as Issei, if any for that matter.  Even the new characters that come in late in the first season you are able to paint a pretty good picture of them even with just a few lines of dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10: As I said this show doesn't take itself too serious throughout the show but that is part of its charm.  It just offers a good mild entertainment value with a simple story premise to follow.  There were even a few moments where I was laughing as to how stupid it was being, again that was part of its charm.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10: If you are able to get past all of the female nudity and the sex reference you may enjoy watching this anime.  It isn't the greatest anime but it most certainly isn't the worst thing put out.",

            "content": "Hi! Robert's Too Late Review coming down! Check the synopsis, minor spoilers possibly, and of note, I'm reviewing the dub version. This review is only of the first season, I will update and revise as I finish the final season of the series. Until then, this is dealing only with Season 1. First of all, yes, DxD has boobs. Fine, fine, DxD has a LOT of boobs. But there's more to be had here. Read on and see if this series warrants a spot on the vaunted wall! \r\nStory: 9\r\nThis anime is quite famous for the ecchi elements, and make no doubt, this show isabsolutely saturated in fanservicey nudity and innuendo. For that matter, it often goes beyond just innuendo and has characters outright proposition each other. While we never stray below the belt (or the panty-line, most commonly in this series) there are still quite a bit of overt, and mostly over-the-top sexuality. The thing about this is, however, we are served a storyline that is absolutely sound outside of all the fanservice. In fact, I believe that if one was to completely extract every last ounce of nudity from this anime, the supernatural plot would still leave this series highly rated. \\n\\n\r\nWe have a story of devils and fallen angels, exorcists and errant nuns, powers and battles. There is an element of coming to terms with one's own inner weaknesses and even strengths as we watch the characters move through this supernatural tale. If you have any interest in mythological stories, tales dealing with otherworldly powers then there's a lot to like here. That is, if you can look past the silly nudity and perverted elements that pervade the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is a great mistreatment of the female characters, which is odd, considering they comprise the majority of the cast. Rias, while the strong female lead, still is rather helpless without Issei, the male lead. Every woman seems to only be able to exist within the confines of their relationship with either Issei or another male character. Rias is presented as Issei's master, and a *very* high ranking devil, but still is almost subservient to his wants and desires. In the end, it's still about Issei rescuing Rias, not powerful Rias saving herself. This part of the story is troubling. Seeing this kind of thing is not uncommon, but is distressing regardless. I would love to have seen all these female characters, of which regarding the main cast are all *far* more powerful than our male lead Issei, acting in an empowered manner, and standing for themselves. By bringing the story constantly back to focus on how Issei is ultimately the deciding factor and the only important player with power, the story is weakened, which is sad because as I sad, we have a great foundation for a story of powerful devils and their activities. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless, the story still stands strong even in the face of this groan inducing downplay of feminine power. And yes, if you are here to see boobs, there are plenty to go around. There is also a strong comedy element attached to the ecchi material. As usual, the pervert's cliched behavior is played off as comedic relief. I will admit at times, it is actually funny. While I just made a long declaration about female positioning in this anime, the truth is that for a good part of it, Issei is a breast-obsessed idiot. Another trope in and of itself, a powerful, usually male, lead character having an inverse relationship between his power levels and his intelligence. One line from the dialog to highlight this: Issei actually says at one point: \"I'm fine with being stupid!\" Yeah. That's....informative. Overall, the story is about his growth, as he comes into his own powers, and in his love for Rias. He does make some movements of growth, but this is still very much a battle and boob fest. \\n\\n\r\nStill, even with the dings, the story of devil fights and awesome battles still very much interests me, and I'm excited to see each new layer of power, and each tidbit of lore related revelations.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nAbsolutely mind blowing, (no pun intended) the art on DxD is just staggeringly cool. And I'm not just referring to the 'jiggly orbs' as Issei might say. The battle powers are intense and cool, character and animation flow are superb. Whereas another anime might give you a solid, yet fairly simple animation of a person executing a power in a direct manner, DxD will have the camera spinning around the character, and especially if they are female (which they almost always are) the view will zoom up and down their bodies, giving the requisite panty shot, but also adding a layer of complexity to the entire animation. For example, a normal show might have 'arm up, arm forward, blast' where this anime will have 'arm up, spinning camera down to thigh level, quick panty shot before spinning all the way back to fingertips quickly then around and dow as the arm comes forward and then blast'. This attention to detail, albeit the ecchi details, gives the art a highly polished look. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nin the dub version, the voices are amazing. I am a big Jamie Marchi fan, and this was my real first exposure to her talents working a lead role. She voices Rias with perfect weight and smoothness. I absolutely, totally LOVE Akeno's original voice actress, and because of her superior work Akeno is one of my favorite all time characters. Asia's voice is borderline annoying at times, but she sounds appropriately innocent which fits her character well. Koneko's voice is really cool and gives her the ability to play off her insults at Issei in a very comedic way, as one of the only girls not down for the whole 'let's be Issei's harem' idea. Even Kiba's voice is fitting for his form and style, so why only and 8 when I give all this praise? Well, I said I would limit this review to Season 1, but I think it's relevant to say, don't get too attached to Issei or Akeno's voices, as they do not make it to the end of the series. That alone is what troubles me about the sound in this anime. Otherwise I'm good, the battles are nice, the background music is well played, and the theme songs are fun. The only other ding really is the Sacred Gear itself and the need to say 'boost!' over and over, anime calling out powers before use is almost a requirement. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nAh, the place this series shines the brightest, and fails the hardest. Interesting dichotomy, huh? I've gotten into this a bit in the story section, but I will reiterate that the females all seem to be about falling over themselves for Issei's attention, and not standing upright on their own. Yet, they are in fact powerful characters, and this isn't completely hidden behind the 'does he love me?' wall. Rias throws down when needed, and early on before the romance subplot weakens her, she's fairly firm at times with Issei. Akeno is ass-kicking wrapped in traditional miko garb, and is very sexually excited by inflicting pain on others. Asia however immediately falls into the rut of needing Issei's approval for everything. This is tempered by the fact he is responsible for bringing her into the devil family to begin with, so it's not completely unwarranted. \\n\\n\r\nThe support cast of Koneko and Kiba are interesting characters as they are not involved in crushing on Issei. Koneko considered Issei a pervert of the highest order (he is) and Kiba is male, and either straight, or Issei is not his type whatsoever. This does lend a little balance, but they do kind of take a back seat to the Issei love fest. Issei is, of course, a bit of an idiot as I've said, but as he gains power, he loses some of his foolish ways. But make no mistake, even by the end of the season he's still flipping out over naked breasts and the idea of sex with any number of the female cast. \\n\\n\r\nBasically we have a male that starts out stereotypical that slowly gains a tiny bit of brainpower coupled with strong females that quickly lose their self reliance as they become attracted to Issei. Therein we have great characters at the same time as ones that fail. While it's fine to have Rias impressed with Issei when he fights for her sake, with honest feeling in his heart for her, its still overdone that she's basically putty in his hands when she's supposed to be the next ruler of the Underworld and he's just a reincarnated human that she herself brought back. I love the characters (especially Akeno) but yet at the same time despair over how they all lose their minds as Issei grows in power. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nDespite the glaring flaws, this anime is still an utter blast to watch. The pacing is well done, and the overall plot is interesting. I love the whole devil angle that's played. I wish they did a little less on the fanservice, and have hopes that we see that element downplayed as the series pushes on in seasons. I would love to show the overall story to people like my niece who is coming to age, but the saturation of breasts and clothes being ripped off makes what otherwise might be something she really enjoyed inappropriate for her. Its hard to discuss this anime with some people because they hear DxD and instantly think 'pervert alert'. No one wants to credit the story, the animation, the awesome battles with the praise they deserve because the main character had to go and make one of his powers the ability to remove all a girls' clothes with a thought. If they swung around less boobs in the show, I think it would likely be even more popular because there are many that don't appreciate the juvenile nature of the ecchi content. I say the other elements far outweigh the embarrassment and droll ecchi elements and deserve a serious watch, serious consideration. \\n\\n\r\nJust know you're going to have to slog through a good deal of drooling, nude girls, and enough adjectives for breasts to fill a dictionary before you go in. Final verdict? Great, if you can get past the breasts (or enjoy them if you wish, who am I to mind?) and finally Akeno herself ranked two pictures on the wall. (because she's super awesome, clearly) Until next time, my friends!",

            "content": "Ecchi. Harem. Fanservice. Highchool DxD falls into these categories of shows that Funimation loves to scoop up so they can sell replacement soft core pornography on Xbox Live for 13 year olds who have their parent\u2019s credit. These T&A focused shows are the bane of most advocates of artistic anime out there since they tend to be the anime punching bag for most conservative straight arrows who like to ridicule anything different by using its most provocative qualities. While most shows of this type try their best to hide their sex filled fantasies with some simple action, convoluted  plot devices, and dry humor; DxDcomes out a step above the rest by being both undeniably drenched in sexiness and a fun and un-embarrassing watch.\\n\\n\r\nIssei is an ordinary high school boy who has only one thing on his mind: sex. Actually it is more that he is really into boobs because he is so juvenile and innocent that I am not sure he would even know what to do with a girl if he got one. After suddenly being asked out on a date by one his classmates, he is one step closer to making his dreams of having a girlfriend come true. That is until she turns out to be a demon, puts a spear through his heart, and leaves him to die; you know the typical first date stuff. His life is soon saved by a beautiful red haired girl from his school who is another demon from a rival faction. An heir to the devil\u2019s thrown actually, and he soon becomes a part of her court of chess pieces (or lesser devils) and now must use his life, as well as a great power only he possesses, to carry out the whims off his new master\u2026 and blah blah blah we get it\u2026 this a fantasy light novel adaptation, the formula hasn\u2019t changed much since Shakugan no Shana.\\n\\n\r\nStory wise DxD does falls into a great number of genre convictions that have been well treed territory by similar fare for the past decade. But what makes this show work is that it raises a step above the rest in both its shonen style action and slice of life humor while not being afraid to take itself less serious. The story is easy to follow while keeping with these genre trappings and even offers an interesting and vaguely original concept in the way it uses its devils vs angels motif. The devils being the good guys (or at least the faction we follow) is a weird divergent from how most of stories handle this rivalry. This is echoed by a chorus of new to the group characters (including a once devout nun of the church) who find out that god doesn\u2019t really care for devils that much; a concept that is established through a running gag of praying to god leading to a horrible headache in return. The show recycles many running gags other shows of the genre have done, but always in innovative and funny ways, even Issei\u2019s typical male mc \u201cBaka! Ecchi!\u201d moments of running into girls in provocative situations are less infuriating and mind numbing than other series. The humor stays consistent and genuinely funny as tasks to fulfil mortal wishes to gain a contract of the person\u2019s soul (another play on the devils motif) turn into hilarious and bizarre misadventures, and a battle with a dreaded tentacle monster is less of a commentary and more a bizarre parody or homage to an old established trope.\\n\\n\r\nThe character archetypes run the gambit from sweet masochist, clumsy moe bait, and bishonen hottie, but also have a few refreshing takes. Mainly Rias Gremory who ventures out of tsundere territory, and her noble aristocrat manner of behaving makes her an actually compelling love interest as her character develops through the series. Some characters achieve more development while the side characters with less screen time back up events just enough to be notable additions and are set up well enough to have interesting arches in the second season. While the show goes great to lengths to treat its primarily strong female cast with respect, it does fall victim to the male power fantasy \u201cgot to save the princess\u201d trope near the end of the first season. It at least does not dive into complete misogyny like other series that have done the same plotline such as Sword Art Online. It is funny that a show that gets off on female nudity handles female characters better than a popular show like SAO that tries to hide its hideous portrayal of gender roles.\\n\\n\r\nAs you may have noticed thus far, Highschool DxD\u2019s nudity brings in a very deserving mature rating and not something I would suggest for viewers who would find this offensive. That being said, as someone who has unfortunately set through a good deal of this fodder, the art and animation of the show has some great um\u2026 angles\u2026 of \u2026 the ladies. Okay let\u2019s not dance around this, if you like fanservice than the camera work and art direction is second to none, sure to leave no one wanting on this side.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to sound design, DxD comes through with an impressing opening and closing performance while the show\u2019s score does its best to capitalize on both the tension and shenanigans found in the series. A worth-while English dub produced by Funimation features a diverse cast of old guard and new talent, that does not disappointed in terms of its script. Jamie Marchi as Rias Gremory lends an elegant performance, would be hard pressed to find a better fit. While Jad Saxton as the petite but strong Koneko Toujou delivers some great and punchy one liners. The English adaptation is not afraid to play around with explicit language, and for a show that already has mature themes in other departments, this is a welcome addition.\\n\\n\r\nThe ecchi genre is by far one of the more popular genres of anime today. The top anime of many streaming services like Netflix tend to have these shows in the top spot, while companies like Funimation and Sentai spend a good deal of marketing on them. While the genre can be over-run with weak and embarrassing shows, Highschool DxD finishes a step above the rest and is must watch for anyone interested.",

            "content": "Highschool DxD is exceptionally well at providing all the perverted nudity that anyone could dream of, but it manages to rise above many other anime found in the ecchi genre by providing a decent story, some interesting characters and  a lot off colour humour.\r\nStory=7\r\nHighschool DxD depicts an action and romance filled conflict between supernatural beings in the present day. The story is actually somewhat interesting. With good pacing and some decent writing, it\u2019s easy to not get board during the few scenes that don\u2019t have any nudity. The dialogue was better than expected, and the writers eagerly express their wit and cleverness to providesome funny yet somewhat truthful dialogue. Obviously, one does not have to look far to find an anime with a more compelling and interesting story, but this is forgivable considering that your probably not going to watch this anime based the merit of its story.\\n\r\nArt=9\\n\r\nThe reason your likely going to watch this anime is for the \u201cart\u201d, an area that Highschool DxD excels in. Overall the animation is great. All of the characters are cute and sexy, and never shy from flaunting their fully naked bodies for your pleasure. The characters and environments are vividly detailed and some of the characters\u2019 demonic powers look pretty cool.\\n\r\nSound=7\\n\r\nThe English dub of the show has mediocre voice acting with a decent soundtrack. The opening and end credits have especially catching songs.\\n\r\nCharacters=6\\n\r\nThe characters are unrealistic when it comes to their bodies and their sexual tendencies, although I\u2019m sure many can relate to the poor ol main character who just wants to get laid and fondle some breasts. The characters aren't necessarily all that bad though, as this is an ecchi and a harem, and it\u2019s almost required that most of the girls instantly and unexplainably fall for the male lead. With this being said, it was nice that the characters were unique, and had different roles to play in action sequences. Additionally, lots of the characters had some very humorous dialogue.\\n\r\nEnjoyment=9\\n\r\nAs far as enjoyment is concerned, I suppose this depends on the person, but for the most part I would describe this show as very enjoyable. Hot girls comprise nearly the entire cast, and the amount of nude shots is almost ridiculous. Complement this with a decent story and characters, as well as some good art and sound and you have yourself a pretty damn good ecchi that is definitely worth checking out. \\n\r\nOverall=7",

Each character has outstanding personality. My personal favourite character is Koneko .She is the loli mascot type white small breasts. Other characters have personalities going from sadist to pervert to a little boy who dresses and looks like a girl. All these different array of characters really kept me interested.\r\nThe opening songs were pretty good but not that good that I would listento the opening scene every time I watched a new episode. The end songs on the other hand just blew my mind. The song mixed with the end scene where all the female characters dancing on stripper poles just got me really pumped up to start a new episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty good I would say but nothing outstanding like Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Bladeworks or Attack on Titan but the use of red in the anime really caught my attention.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack matched perfectly with every scene and never disappointed me. The main story of Issei trying to become the harem king and joining the Gremory house finally obtaining a harem always made me laugh .\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of it all Highschool DxD  was pretty damn good for me and made me love anime more and more and allowed me to see a side of anime that I fell in love with.",

It did take a while for me to really get into it but having all three seasons at a push of a button was a real motivator for me to watch this and really get into it.  \\n\\n\r\nIt is really a one of my best, yet I haven\u2019t watched much, and to think this one is pale in comparison to its successors.

Was this even an anime? It felt more like an episode of Girls Gone Wild with random super powers thrown in. It starts off with a pathetically desperate [virgin] teenage boy fawning over the female anatomy, which immediately hooks the audience with the intensity of comical relief. Predictably, our naive protagonist becomes entangled with some mysterious babes at the school who are involved in enigmatic activities. At this point, you're nodding your head like,\"Okay,I see where this is going\"...., But then the plot regarding his sweet potential love interest turns into some illuminati shit. I'm not exaggerating when I say, it went from 0 to 100 nigga real quick. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is fairly predictable as it progresses, however if you're a fan of any respectable action anime, I suggest if you've started this, drop it here. We've all become somewhat acquainted with the type of leading male role who is laughably incompetent\u2013 but, Issei takes it to a whole other level. In essence, he's a scrawny sidekick with a magic mitten that shoots fireworks, which is supposed to miraculously save him from villainous vixens with a chest large enough to suffocate him. I digress. \\n\\n\r\nGetting to know the female characters provides a sense of attachment, and a charming aura, but that's about it. It's actually pretty hilarious when the creators attempt to formulate an emotional scene, but we all know what you're really staring at. This anime was poorly done in several aspects...\\n\r\n But tits are all the justification I need. 10/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "If you've made it this fair and are now reading my review, then by now you've realized this is an ecchi/harem, and a rather revealing one at that.  I hardly think that's an issue with those of you who are interested in a good harem, and for those who came here expecting a deeply interwoven dramatic plot, it might be best to now consider what you're working with here.  Nevertheless this is by far the most entertained I've been regarding any series in a little while and here's why...(The following review will contain no spoilers)\r\nStory 6/10-  The story isn't the reason whyyou're going to be interested in High-school DxD, plain and simple.  However it certainly hold enough plot to actually make you wonder about certain things other than the obvious and enjoyable fan-service. Early on the main character Hyoudou Issei, a typical perverted highschooler is thrown into a not so typical situation.  The supernatural elements are very prevalent in this story and it's actually pretty interesting for what it is.  Highschool DxD does a good enough job laying a foundation where the characters can grow within, and not making it the most ridiculous thing you've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10-  The art is good overall, nothing really to complain about but it won't amaze you in any profound way.  All of the characters however are all very well designed, they all have some conventional traits from the usual archetypes presented in anime.  That said though, they all have unique quirks and curves or lack thereof(I'm sorry I had to) that make them all very distinguishable from one another.  Aside from the crisp character designs, the different settings they find themselves in are also nicely presented and you aren't stuck within a club-room or classroom like some Harem so often choose to do.  \\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10-  The sounds isn't anything to write home about.  Much like the story, and there really isn't much to say about it other than it has have a good OP and the rare fitting score in the background from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10-  Other than enjoying the series itself, this is by far the best and most important part of the entire anime.  Every single girl in the harem is noticeably different and aren't fawning over left, right and center for the guy.  They all have unique powers and traits as well that interests you, and actually wants to see how strong they are.  All of this is just gravy on top of how well the characters are voiced.  I would normally put this part in the \"sound\" section but the seiyuu add so so much to the characters, it would be better mentioned here.  They're all very fitting voices and provide distinct personality to every one of them.  You just know it's a good harem when the characters are this well developed and presented when many other in the same genre tend to \"cheat\" and skip ahead.  On top of that, the main character Hyoudou Issei is a great male lead.  He's never whining or beating himself up over nothing.  He will sometimes make a crack about how he hasn't done something, but nothing that will make you want to slap him silly.  He also progresses nicely along with the others and quickly proves he has a strong place in the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10-  My favorite part of the review of course.  This is my favorite harem I have ever watched for many of the reasons stated above and then some.  I felt interested and invested in the characters and actually cared enough about the story arcs to be able to watch multiple episodes consecutively.  Usually I find this difficult with a Harem genre since most don't have too much else drawing you in.  This show has plenty of romance and it actually builds nicely rather than have all these beautiful girls just smitten with love right off the bat.  Look at it this way, while he's surrounded by these beautiful women, he's only given an opportunity and still has to work very hard for their affection and love.  Plainly put, I very much enjoyed this anime and will be re-watching it in the future when it leaves my recent memory.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10-  I highly recommend this to anyone remotely interested in the harem/ecchi genre.  The ecchi is very open but somehow does feel rightly placed because that's not all there is to it.  There's a nice developing romance(s) going on, the characters are actually very interesting and easy to root for as well.  For those who are thinking about watching their first Harem/ecchi this would be the one to start with.",

            "content": "High School DxD is an anime in which you either have a deep hatred of it or you love High School DxD for how it compliments the ecchi genre so well...\r\nThis review will cover on why i personally think DxD is or is one of the greatest ecchi harem's ever...\r\nSTORY\r\nHigh School DxD revolves around our main protagonist; Issei Hyoudou who is a pretty generic horny pervert that dreams of having his very own harem one day. He ends up being killed by a fallen angel and falls under Rias Gremory's Occult Research Club. HOWEVER, High School DxD is possibly one of if not the ONLYecchi harem anime to actually use the fanservice to develop the plot and also gives Issei a driving force to defeat enemies. Although the writers were smart enough to make Issei have hardly any pure power or op strengths in the beginning as this allows for character development to take place. Issei and the gang each have their own unique and sometimes even funny personalities which allow more interesting and less generic boring scenes to take place.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nThe art style in High School DxD was unique due to the fact that it had an older sort of style to it. While others see this is 'terrible and looks awful' I'd say that the style really complements the character's designs and attributes. Having more of a new art style would make DxD appear as more of a childish moe styled anime while in fact it's actually quite mature.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe audio quality in DxD was as usual from Madman, very high quality. The fighting sounds were on point and they even had the dub cast spot on with the anime. DxD actually ends up on the good side of dubs. The OST is also very high quality with most of the background music during fights and such fitting perfectly into the feel of DxD\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I would recommend DxD due to the facts that it's overall a very stable anime even though it has some generic scenes filled into it. It's 56th most popular anime on MAL, this might be due to the fanservice or other's recommending it to their peers. The storyline is amazing due to the fact the writers use the fan-service to their advantage in developing the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

But that might not be the case with this anime. Originally a Light Novel series by Ichiei Ishibumi and later adapted as an anime by TNK, Highschool DxD.\r\n~STORY 9/10\r\nHyoudou Issei is a typical teenage boy, thinking about nothing but breasts and \"ecchi stuff\". If you count out his two best friends, he is basically a loner. He has always wanted a girlfriend, and this one day, his wish comes true. Abeautiful young girl meets him on his way home from school, and asks him out. \\n\r\nHe plans this date very well, and on the day it goes accordingly, he thought.. It appears she had plans of her own, when she brutally stabs him in the city park. She then reveals herself to be a vicious fallen angel who planned to kill Issei to get rid of his sacred gear, also know as Gods Artifacts. These are items with powerful abilities that are given to humans when they're born. Issei feels his life slipping away, and his consciousness fades. He then wakes up in his bed at home, alongside the most beautiful student in his school, the crimson haired Rias Gremory. She tells him that he died, but was reincarnated by her as a devil, and she is now his master.\\n\\n\r\n\"My name is Rias Gremory. I am a Devil. And I am your Master. Nice to meet you, Hyoudou Issei-kun. Can I call you Ise?\" (Volume 1, Life 1)\\n\\n\r\nAlright, this anime. I love it. The popular saying \"came for the *plot*, stayed for the plot\" works both ways in this case. I really like the story, and most other ecchi harem stories get blown out of the water. After watching DxD I've seen some other ecchi harem anime, and oh my god. It made me realize that DxD is actually the best ecchi harem I've seen. Most of the characters are interesting and fun. The plot keeps a good pace, and tells a surprising amount of story, considering most people see DxD as 12 episodes of jiggling boobies and sexual innuendos.\\n\\n\r\n~CHARACTERS 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAh yes, the characters. I loved the characters for the most part. I decided to only cover the absolute main characters, since they're the ones you see the most.\\n\\n\r\nRias Gremory - She starts of as a \"normal\" highschool girl, but at the same time, she is the most popular student, and the most beautiful girl in school. She is revealed to be aDevil. A high-class devil in fact, and is currently gathering peerage members/servants. This makes her a [king]. This is explained later in the season. Rias is shown as a very caring and protective person. She treats her group more like family rather then to boss them around. I really liked this aspect, and it shows that a master/leader dosent have to be bossy. She's also got to be one of the characters with the most development, mostly towards Ise, but also the other group members.\\n\\n\r\nHyoudou Issei - The main character, a pretty generic harem MC, or that's atleast what he looks like. Ise was different then most harem MC's in my opinion. Of course, he messes up most of the possible ecchi moments with the girls. He is killed by a fallen angel, and reincarnated by Rias and is now a [Pawn] piece in her peerage. Ise is born with a Boosted Gear, a unique sacred gear with the spirit of a dragon.\\n\\n\r\nOther important characters include the sadistic and seductive Akeno, the violent first-year loli Koneko, Kiba the womanizer, and a whole lot more.\\n\\n\r\n~ART/ANIMATION 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSome people may say the DxD art is pretty bad, and its not my favorite art either, but its not as bad as people want it to be. I think this style fit the show great, and shouldn't really go trough any changes. And when it comes to the animation, I think its very good, and its a pretty huge plus for me. Ofcourse, It probably wont ever match itself with some of the anime made by bigger studios like Kyoto Animation, Bones or Madhouse Studios, I think TNK did a pretty good job to work out some great animation. \\n\\n\r\n~MUSIC/SOUND 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundeffects for DxD are just great. Everything is just so well thought-out and fits so well. And the soundtrack is just fantastic. It varies from the peaceful songs during calm dialog scenes, to powerful and dramatic music for fights and serious events.\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs thematically fit the series very well, and maintains the quality of the series. In the release of the Original Highschool DxD Soundtrack, a GS! Version of STUDY x STUDY was released. It's the same song, but now the characters voice actors does the vocals instead.",

            "content": "High School DxD... This is an interesting anime to say the least, it's very action packed, very supernatural oriented and i'm completely in awe with the creative combat methods, and chess-like hierarchy. I was completely immersed, watching the show, as it has a dark but courageous story line, and yes you are rooting for an underdog who is quite down to earth, and will be as mindblown as you - the viewer as the show explains and reveals more depth to the main plot as you go on.\r\nPersonally, my favorite aspect of the show is the character design, there are a wide range of personalitiesout there that you'll come across that couldn't be better suited to their role. I'm finding it hard to put into words what i find so intense, and exiting about this show without giving too much away...\\n\r\nI think the fighting is creative, intense and the big picture behind the show is far fetched thus i found it very interesting easy to dig into.\\n\\n\r\nOf course i've got to mention that there is a lot of Ecchi, embedded into the way the story is told, and while it's a shame that this gives to non-viewers a dumb, shallow impression of the story, at times (i'm surprised i'm saying this) it is actually of some significance and helps to bring not only a level of intimacy, but also it functions as a large part of the comedy involved.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, i'd say that the show perhaps encompassed too broad a' spectrum of themes (which i could go on forever about), but if you can follow this relatively fast paced, action packed and thoroughly interesting fighting oriented story, without getting too hooked on one specific part of the show, i think you'll love it.\\n",

Kuoh Academy Private Institution filled with what seems to be filled with high class young women with the sole intention of creating a Harem.\r\n Since before their transfer Kuoh Academy was a all female school that went coed a year ago, To the disappointment of Issei the reality isn't what the dream that he foresaw with his buddies.\r\nThe harsh reality?Issei and his buddies are despised by the student body for having over active libidos and extreme desire to go on a date. He is shown to be under the observation of a Red haired beauty asking for his name, She sent a spy to keep a tab on Issei. Pervert at the exterior Issei is pure at heart and on his way home he meets a girl his age from another institution that flat out confessed to him. \\n\\n\r\nIssei goes out with the girl on a date he has methodically prepared with the greatest of anticipation, Imagine his surprise that after the date comes to an end she whispers to his Ear a favor.\\n\\n\r\n\"...Will you die For me?\"\\n\\n\r\nHigh School DxD it's the empire of well done of the Raunchy Genre [Ecchi], It's chemistry with Supernatural element It's nothing short of masterful, As the series manages to pull most of the Fan Service as Erotica and the choice of OST during the scenes are downright on point. This series is literally Erotica meets Comedy and gets along with Supernatural.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the trolls that just write bad out their ass without even knowing what the hell Ecchi is, I have watched all ecchi anime in existence and Let me tell you I've actually seen the bad and this is GOOD. \\n\\n\r\nART: 10/10\\n\r\nThe animation it's brought to us by TNK not exactly a renowned studio that after making this series made the Otaku community noticed them as a force to be reckoned with. \\n\\n\r\nThe art it's refreshing and the coloring it's vivid yet cold enough to bring out the situations to good light portrayed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe intro and ED is amazing, The cast is passionate and pour their hearts to everything they do. The OST are methodically done right.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10 / 10\\n\r\nThe characters are refreshing and unlike other Ecchi there isn't a Tsundere or the other Deres that are so common in anime with the exception of the popular Kudere with a rest of a crew of women yet to have a type of dere assigned to them.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime also brings a Sadist to the crew of hotties and let me tell you her input to the Fan Service it's outright orgasmic. A form of uniqueness that brings Ecchi to a whole new level.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 / 10\\n\r\nI was baffled by the execution, Ecchi animes unlike other genres aren't about the plot. In fact doing a plot review most of the time on Ecchi anime will make the reviewer look like a total NOOB and you wouldn't be taken serious as a reviewer. Since Ecchi genre is Raunchy and it's exist for sheer entertainment and lighten up the mood.\\n\\n\r\nHowever DxD steps up to the plate and pushes the bar to a level not know to the genre to step up their game. It might as well be the evolution of Ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 / 10\\n\r\nIf you love Ecchi, Supernatural and Comedy together and wanna be surprised with some thriller?. This anime is for you, Granted you know the definition of Ecchi and Fan Service and know full well that whining of Fan Service on a Ecchi installation is like Wondering why do gore flick have blood.\\n\\n\r\nI'll leave you the reader with that.",

            "content": "What more can I say, DxD is often thought of as the Jesus of ecchi anime and for good reason, it just does everything better then other ecchi animes.\r\nStory 9/10: Now compared to other more serious anime, DxD's story is nothing special, however in the realm of ecchi it's one of if not the best. I have to give credit to the writers for creating a good story around all the fanservice.\r\nArt 9/10: Ecchi anime has to have good art, after all your coming to lear at sexy anime girls. DxD succeeds in this, every girl is hot and/or cute in this anime. Weather itbe our busty bombshells Rias and Akeno to the adorable loli Koneko. Backgrounds and battle sequences look amazing as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: The OP was decent in my opinion, and the music they use for the feels moments is nice, and the more comedic scenes all fits very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: DxD's characters are icons in the ecchi world, even before I watched it I knew who Rias was. Now something DxD did very right that other harem ecchi don't is Issei. Issei is my favorite harem lead, why, because he is a perv! This is I feel makes him far more relateble than other harem leads and adds more personality to him. Now for the girls, and we have an amazing cast of them. Rias is every red head lovers dream, Akeno is delightfully pervy and just as sexy as Rias, Koneko is the funniest loli ever, and Asia is just precious. So if you want hot girls and a actually good harem lead, DxD delivers!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: Why do we watch ecchi? To see ass and titties! DxD gives us that and in just the right amount, that it doesn't become overwhelming. You'll get your fanservice but you'll also get a good story and good character development, it's a win-win all the way!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: If you want fanservice, humor, a good story, and even developed characters, you will get it all in DxD. Very highly recommend this for anyone wanting to get into ecchi.\\n\\n",

            "content": "(.y.) is all this anime gives.\r\nBut therefor it isn't uninteresting.\r\nStory:\r\nIf you like fan service and I mean fan service of the highest level for each of the 12 episodes? Than this anime is the right one for you. The story is simple and actually the anime has 2 parts. One part is about a fight against fallen angels, and the other is about preventing a marriage.\r\nThe second part is much better than the first part so be sure to watch it till episode 12. But you don't need to worry each episode gives us plenty of funny moments and hardcore action. Ow and yea wesee like boobs flying around in every scene. At some point we get so much fan service that the anime begins to feel like a hentai rather than a anime. But luckily they pick up the story right after these episodes and the story develops itself to a nice plot and a epic last fight were no boobs are shown!!! No boobs? It's funny how the entire anime and all it's fights and moments constantly give us boobs and other fan service. But that the last and final fight is between two guys. \\n\\n\r\nAh well the anime was epic, funny and nice enough to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nOur main character is a really horny kid who dies and becomes a devil. He does nothing else than spot for naked chicks he feels no shame what so ever. And he never grows up. But hey if you want a ecchi anime don't complain about the fan service. And who can really blame the guy I mean he is surrounded by females who are constantly naked and even when he fights most of the girls lose their outfits. I think every man would go insane.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are mostly hot to watch. We see each of them having a special ability compared to chess pieces. Well we have the queen, a hot chick that is incredibly strong witch has a huge chest and enjoys the suffering of people. We have the rook ah little girl witch doesn't speak much and shows hardly any emotion but can break trough any obstacle. We have the bishop a cute girl who can do healing (although her voice sometimes annoyed me she was still a nice addition). The knight witch is a boy who is very fast with his weapon and I have to say the fight between the knights was truly epic I loved how fast they made the fight look simply amazing. And last but not least we have the king, the king is a beautiful woman who is the leader of the clan and who is incredibly powerful. She looks amazing and is most of the time naked. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\\n\r\nBasically the anime comes down to two plots who aren't that special but non the least epic. We see woman get naked or see their clothes torn apart like every episode. Every fight results in fan service so if you don't like that don't watch it. Although the fights are still epic and amazing and the fan service always results to something funny so if you want to laugh this anime is perfect. \\n\r\nAll I can say, hey if you like hot angels hot demons epic fights brilliant tactics and lots of humor ow and let's not forget lots of fan service than this anime is the perfect anime to fit those conditions. Overall I liked the anime very much, it sometimes goes over the line of what is acceptable for my taste but the whole anime was fun to watch. And I can't wait for season two to arrive. Hope you enjoy this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCheers Lucid",

            "content": "Sidenote: As this is my first review, I really just wanna give my general opinion on the anime rather than go into detail as most of you wont be interested to hear about the whole thing.\r\nTo me, Highschool DxD is one of my all time favorite ecchi animes. Mainly because of how diverse the characters are and how interesting the plot is. The art is very good, but the animation (except the action scenes which are breathtaking) are usually not as focused. The story is pretty good but nothing special. Soundtrack-wise, this anime has a decent soundtrack, but gets repetitive most of the time andcan be annoying after awhile. Characters in DxD are amazing and probably are the highest point of the anime in general. But the main reason you really watch Dxd is for a few reasons: tits, boobs, nipples, ass, boobs, and boobs. \\n\\n\r\nMany of the elements of the anime are perfectly executed even if they are slightly \"different\" than any other ecchi's that you have probably seen before. Most of the plot is moved by sex, females, and sexual-orientated plot devices that while are different from many linear plot lines in other ecchi's, DxD does a good job of taking these elements and creating a plot around them.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, this is something that I watch frequently as it is just a fun anime to watch. All the characters are interesting and good to love or hate. By the end, you will be ready to watch the 2nd and 3rd seasons as they are just as good.\\n\\n\r\n(More reviews like this will be posted soon so if you enjoyed, they are on my page)",

Pretty strong to put fanservice where there no need. Even better to do an ending and opening who is fanservice. And, hell, the anime is fanservice itself. That's big.\r\nWhat ? You want something worth watching for ? Well, HDxD can be a very enjoyable material if you use itfor sexual enjoyment, I think. It's nearly uncensored for a good reason.\\n\\n\r\nBut if it's story that you want, go for the light novel or the manga.

The story is unoriginal and super cliche and it was not just interesting at all the show had lots of potential but failed miserably I can tell they only focused on 2 things out of the whole tv show and that's fanservice and the funny ass English dub. Another thing I hate about the show is the large amount of useless fan service. The characters are cliche as hell and bland and the villan is a mediocre douche bag with a harem of sluts, there is 0 character development. Rias Gremory a strong independent woman becomes a damsel in distress after she is forced to marry the douche bag villan, the our MC realizes he loves her and has to get her back so he rushes down there and kicks the villans ass and Rias falls in love with him . I've seen this in anime so many times I wasn't even all that surprised because the whole fight is predictable. The stray devil thing was pretty cool and the devil errand runs were funny but it got old and very boring.  sound is ok the art is pretty good. Right now im gonna list everything DxD has just like any other harem .\\n\r\n1.Loser MC\\n\r\n2.the main love interest has big tits and is extremely popular \\n\r\n3.MC has some kind of special power\\n\r\n4.Cliche speeches about how strong the MC has become \\n\r\n5.DoucheBag villan\\n\r\n6.Boobs and Ass\\n\r\n7.Shitty Plot\\n\r\n8.Useless side characters\\n\r\n9.ok fight scenes\\n\r\n10.harem or soon to be harem\\n\r\nAlmost forgot I know i said the characters sucked but creed is by far the best character in this show besides issei.\\n\\n\r\nNow finishing my review DxD is nothing amazing its extremely overrated and cliche the plot sucks the characters suck (except for creed and issei of course) and the whole show fucking sucks. It took me a while to realize this show was a pile of doo-doo. If you like anime with a boobs,ass and comedy you might like this anime. This show is good fap material and good for a laugh or two but if your looking for a show with a good story don't watch this anime.\\n\r\n I just started the light novels , read the light novels they're wayyyy better.\\n",

This is really unnecessary to me, breaks all the emotional.\\n\\n\r\nSo lets talk about this f* Issei, poor Rias to fall in love to a guy that not even can call her for the first name, cant even see she loves him, if the romance of these two was worked out better, that would be very good for the story, I really appreciate a good couple and it's very sad to see Rias in love with him and he just thinking about harem and other girls' breasts.\\n\r\nI mean is not like Asia, Akeno and the others are bad, but he literally doesn't try nothing with any of them. For me it is very sad to see a possible novel barely exploited, with the excuse of being a Harem, and even with that excuse, the creator still makes the girls fall in love with this protagonist who does not give a shit for there love for him, only the breasts. And im not saying he dont care about them you can clearly see his rage when he thinks Asia is dead (talking about 3 season), but think about that it would it be better that in this moment of fury he was thinking that he lost his girlfriend, or the person he loves?\\n\r\n And it does not have to be in the specific fight in which he thinks that Asia has died, imagine in the last arc of the third season, where Rias loses control of itself, he could go save her and return with new girlfriend, but no, he saves her, finally calls her name, wins a kiss. And forget everything, YES HE FORGOT IT.\\n\\n\r\nIt might have been a great show, but some details really disappointed me.\\n\r\nIf you do not care about anything I mentioned, you're just looking for an anime with breasts jumping all over and does not care about history at all. Go for it.",

(Which most of us watching are)\r\n- Besides the over sexualized girls, I feel like they have some personality.\r\n- I first saw this when I was a freshman in high school so this show pretty much inspired me to have sex with as many girls as possible. (I managed to get 3 xD)\r\nThe negatives:\r\n- Plot is pretty bad at some points\r\n- Our protagonist doesn'tactually have sex with any of them, although it does get pretty close.\\n\r\n- Animation takes a hit later on (lack of funding)",

            "content": "Story 8/10\r\nWhat you\u2019ll hear from many people is that the story/plot from most ecchi anime are not very good or well put together, and focus more on the ecchi aspect. I think that statement is proven wrong by the great storyline that develops through this season. The plot slowly picks up the pace and builds up character development quite well until you're matched with some great action scenes. The well thought out dialogue and setting truly do the plot justice, and might I add, it\u2019s well deserved. Personally, I feel they did a great job on balancing the key aspects like the ecchi, with thestory aspect. I have to admit though, there are some points where you may feel like the story is moving along slowly,  but it'll make up it. It can surely put you in a spot where you are asking for more and wondering what will happen next. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI thought the characters were a nice addition to the anime. Its nice when you have very different and unique characters that maybe you can relate to in some way. There are, ofcourse the cliches when it comes to ecchi anime but that's too be expected. The main protagonist, Issei Hyoudou, your average highschool boy in love with oppai and perverted as ever. Although there is a nice twist on things, instead, his powers work off of his pervertedness and you can see them slowly improve through time. Rias Gremory, another high school student, also known as the most beautiful girl at the school. Has a nice and unique background that can keep you intrigued, not only are her devil powers interesting, but she also has great oppai ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0). Other characters are also unique, like Akeno Himejima, the lighting using sadistic queen. As Well as Koneko for all you Loli\u2019s out there. Also Kiba who is quite interesting once you get to learn more about him and see his unique power and fighting. \\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, The sound is one of the best parts of this anime. The background music always fits the scene well and are pleasing to the ear. Dramatic scenes are definitely enhanced by the strategically placed background music that can be very strong and powerful. Peaceful scenes accompanied with the music can also help to set the atmosphere.The Voice Actors are nice, they are also fitting to each character, no complaints here. I feel if I was to have read the Light Novels first I would have imagined there voices just as they are. Now for my favourite part, The OP and ED! The Opening, Trip - Innocent of D is always great to listen to, although that's most likely because I\u2019m a sucker for electric guitar. The Ending, STUDY X STUDY is also another great addition. Usually I would skip ED\u2019s but I actually really enjoyed this one, it fits well with the anime. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe art from the anime is nice and although it's not compared to other/larger studios it's still very nice. It definitely fits with the atmosphere given to the watcher, and I enjoy the way it looks. the animation during fighting scenes, they were certainly intriguing to me atleast. And that is a pretty important aspect to have when it comes to animation quality.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\n Overall, DxD was a pretty great watch for me considering it was the first anime I watched ( I\u2019ve rewatched since then). The story constantly put me in a spot where I was asking for more. The characters could make me smile and laugh or wonder. The sounds was intriguing and kept me interested. Although there are some mistakes like every anime, I thought this was a great watch in the end.",

Each episode fills completely natural. An amazing story that you will truly understand once you watch the anime like I did.\\n\\n\r\nOh by the way, there are demons and angels in this anime. I'll leave it at that so I don't ruin this anime before you even watch it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nSome of the visuals were beautiful. The attacks have some amazing effects. Landscapes are absolutely gorgeous. Being in an high school setting, it made perfect sense. Character designs were done flawlessly.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe music playing for the opening and ending sound like heaven. I enjoyed them to the fullest. And they know what music to play during certain situations.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nOnce you start watching High School DxD, you will fall in love with the characters. They are so beautifully designed. At first you see a bosom and then it turns into a elegant flower. Just as the characters do in this anime. Dynamic more than most anime out there. You start to love the characters and what they do.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nDuring the whole time of watching the anime, I found pure enjoyment and satisfaction. Reminded me of no other anime, this is the best of its class.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nIf you love an harem story, look no further, you have found yourself one. An hidden gem at that. If you love big boobs, you probably do since you are watching this anime. But if not, you must have come for the plot for sure. It has an amazing and engaging plot that deepens your bond with the anime. The action/fighting, there are some epic fights that leave you crawling for more. This anime has become like an drug and I just can't get enough of it. It is one of my favorite anime. No, it is my number 1# favorite anime!!",

            "content": "Ok, so I don't remember where I stumbled across this anime but boy am I glad I did. Yes it's very heavily ecchi but don't be put off by it. The ecchi serves a purpose, if you know where to look.\r\nStory - 6 \r\nBefore I knew this was adapted from a series of Light Novels I probably would have rated this part higher. Then I read the Light Novels and realized that it was almost like a preview of things to come. However! This doesn't mean this story isn't enjoyable in it's own right. The two main 'arcs' within this anime are nicely paced andcome to satisfying conclusions. Credit for sticking to the source material has to be given here.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound - 8 \\n\r\nI'm not all that fussy when it comes to art and sound but I'll say that I found DxD more enjoyable because of it's more modern animation style. The end song has a tune that came across to me as almost something Mario-esque. The I saw that the end credits had a pole dancing nun in it and I didn't pay any attention after that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6\\n\r\nFor me, and probably for a lot of readers of the novels, this anime ended too early for any real character development. The groundwork has been laid pretty well, again by sticking tightly to the source material, so that is definitely something to look forward to. I tend to tune out Japanese voice acting when I watch shows in subbed format but I couldn't when I watched this. Particularly Yuki Kaji as Issei, Yoko Hikasa as Rias and Shizuka Ito as Akeno. Their performances were exceptional in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nBeing Welsh, a fan of chess and having an interest in the supernatural this anime ticks just about every box I have. You might wonder what all that has to do with it but you'll understand if you watch it. My enjoyment of this anime skyrocketed when I delved deeper into the other media of DxD but I would never have looked at it twice if this anime hadn't piqued my interest the first time I watched.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9 \\n\r\nOverall you have a decent solid story line which provided a good framework to really push on and develop both the characters and the next few story arcs. Visually very appealing with a soundtrack that is well suited and well used, coupled with some great voice performances  and a flair of originality rarely seen in high school harem animes. Oh yes, and ecchi. Lots and lots of ecchi.",

            "content": "Now that the show has ended, here is my take on the series:\r\nFor those that care, it is  a very ecchi Harem series and your standard \"Fighting makes girls lose all their clothes\" anime. I generally like fighting anime and feel an amused indifference to ecchi, but if you really liked any of the following anime, you'll probably really like High School DxD:\r\nIkkitousen, Freezing, Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou, Queen's Blade, or Sekirei\r\nThe plot of the story is basically Demons vs Demons (DxD) in a highschool setting, set in a world where there is a stalemated war between Demons, Angels and Fallen Angels. There area lot of chess references as well, enough in fact that they become integral to the plot as lesser demons (Pieces) are enslaved to their master (King).\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very good and the series has one of the more interesting ending credits you'll ever see. Characters are stereotypical Moe, but in no way are any of them badly done.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, is a decent anime. If you love Nudity and Girls Fighting anime, this is a must watch. If that type of anime offends you, skip it. Otherwise, it is a decent anime that you may not watch over and over, but at least you won't regret seeing it.\\n\\n\r\nNote: Some versions may be heavily censored.\\n",

            "content": "Okay, I'll be honest with you guys: I LOVE High School DxD.  Doesn't mean that I'll let it off when it come to ratings.\r\nIf this is a little too much to read, I recommend just reading my \"Enjoyment\" and \"Overall\" sections.  That basically summarizes the anime without getting into any finer detail.\r\nTo start off, this show is...GREEAATTerr...maybe?  It isn't...oh...why isn't it good?  Jokes aside, this anime suffers a LOT when you think about it.  The story is a \"6\" and I'm being GENEROUS.  As a fan, I know I might be biased, but I'm going to try my bestto be fair (and so, this review was biased).\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6 - Decent (Fair according to MAL)\\n\\n\r\nWell, better than Hagure Yuusha that's for sure.  This actually has a story!  The story is split into two \"arcs\".  One arc taken from one Light Novel volume.  The first 6 episodes are from the 1st Volume, the next 6 episodes are from the 2nd volume.  They aren't great, but they aren't bad either.  It's decent.  Nothing too special.  It'll entertain you for the next 3-4 hours but don't expect anything too extraordinary.  Just lots...and lots...of obscure jokes about female mammary glands.  Don't say I didn't warn you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 - Actually pretty diverse (Good according to MAL)\\n\\n\r\nIts set pieces are diverse, that's for sure.  They're well drawn and painted and fits the theme of the anime well.  They aren't too unique though since some are basically just night time pieces with purple skies.  The animation remains consistent too.  And I mean that in a very literal sense, Rias's PLOT bounces in like...EVERY scene.  Jokes aside, the art and animation are solid here.  There is no drop in quality and all animation is consistent.  Character designs are solid too, nothing special, but they are copying from a Light Novel's illustrations.  However, one thing to point out though: You'll basically always see them in their school uniforms.  Basically.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 - Very fitting (Great according to MAL)\\n\\n\r\nI don't have to say much.  The track fits the show very, very well.  I don't have to say much.  Each piece has a purpose and it just works.  The opening and ending are...actually pretty unique, MUSIC wise.  They aren't the same as other anime openings and endings and that's all I'll say.  The ending is pretty hilarious though.  I kinda got addicted to it when I watched it the first time...you'll see why.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5 - HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...what?  (Mediocre according to MAL)\\n\\n\r\nOkay, first to say this: NOBODY MATTERS BESIDES ISSEI, RIAS AND ASIA.  Everyone remains the EXACT SAME besides those three.  Issei gets the least character development, though you could argue with Asia.  Rias has a bit more character development but nothing too...substantial.  Again, same problem with 99% of anime: STOCK CHARACTERS.\\n\\n\r\nYou have the dandere tsundere, the sadist, the noble knight, the pervert (our MC), the innocent girl that doesn't know common sense (for now...) and the really, really hot girl that everyone looks up to like a sister and secretly wants to bang...more of Issei on that last bit though.  Their characters remain practically the same throughout the story.  Issei's character changes drastically when we're talking about emotion though, somewhat annoying since he overreacts to the smallest things.  I won't get into anyone else because NOBODY CHANGES.  They're all practically flat characters.  Asia is either happy, sad or shocked.  Rias is always calm and collected with one exception.  Kiba is forever the noble knight.  Koneko, the dandere tsundere.  No comment there.  And Akeno, the super sadist, arguably kuudere.  That's it.  They're all flat and surprisingly ISSEI is the ONLY ROUND CHARACTER in this season...SEASON (gets better in later seasons).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 - I see BOOBS I press like (Outstanding according to MAL)\\n\\n\r\nJokes aside, this is very polar.  On one side, people will LOVE the series for what it is.  On the other side, people will not understand anything and will hate the series.  I'll explain it from a fan's point of view (or mine in this case).\\n\\n\r\nUniverse building, character interaction and story.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I know what you're thinking \"Sonic, you said the story was sh*t!\"\\n\\n\r\nNo, I didn't say the story was shit, I just said that it was average.  But an average story with a good universe is still enticing.  The story is SIMPLE.  Not much thought is needed.  It's not complicated at all.  The universe however is very interesting.  It was interesting enough for me to pick up reading the Light Novels.  They do show you a good portion of the universe here and it keeps on getting more and more interesting.  This show doesn't have THREE seasons for no reason (please god, let there be a fourth).\\n\\n\r\nNow, the concept of \"Devils and Angels\" doesn't really sound anything special, but this guy, the author, he just takes it and ROLLS with it.  He builds up a solid universe with in depth explanations and everything.  Heck, he turned his first Light Novel (Slash Dog) into a PREQUEL to DxD.  The concepts and ideas that he uses is very, very interesting.  However, they may seem insignificant because of all the breast jokes and fan service, but after some thought they're actually very solid concepts.  I do have a problem with the fanservice, but I'll get to that after this one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter interaction.  This is probably the only reason I watch ecchi-harem shows and the same reason for a good portion of you guys too.  The interaction is great.  Exactly as what you'd expect and more.  Though it won't save me from the rant that's coming up in the next paragraph.  It's very solid, that's all I'll say.  It holds up.\\n\\n\r\nNow.  My rant.  FAN SERVICE.  They SHOVE it into your face.  There's fan service in virtually every scene.  I'm not kidding.  If it's not panty shots then it's boob bounces/gainax bounce.  If not that, then it's probably a strip scene!  If you're watching the uncensored version, lock your doors and put on some head phones because you're going to hear moaning, see bare breasts and some other form of perverse fan service  in virtually every episode, EXCEPT the last one.  Thank god for that.  This is actually why so many people hate the show.  They LOVE to shove it right down your mouth.  This is practically fan service incarnate.  Now, there's obviously worse out there now, but for its time, High School DxD is the MOST ecchi anime ever created.  And it does NOT give the show any good favors.  Oh, and remember that \"9\" I gave it for sound?  They have BOOB SOUND EFFECTS.\\n\\n\r\nOh god.\\n\\n\r\nNow, if they toned it down some and only kept \"intense\" scenes so the feel of the anime isn't ruined, then it would fix the problem IMMEDIATELY.  But their constant use of fan service in practically every shot really does get...redundant.  Even if I liked it sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 - Recommended for a try (Very Good according to MAL)\\n\\n\r\nThis may not be your show.  Like I said, it's a  polar choice.  You like it or you hate it.  I'm on the \"like\" side, though I obviously have some qualms about it.  Give it a try.  It's your choice.  Like it for the universe, hate it for its fan service.  It doesn't try to be anything it isn't, it plays the ecchi harem comedy genre straight.  If you know what you're getting into and like this kind of stuff, it's definitely your show.",

Shortly after her first date, he was taken to a park, and then he was killed by the girl. Once thought he was going to die, a red-haired girl approached him and save him. After several episodes elapsed known was that the girl who had a date with him is a fallen angel who use it.\r\nActually thereare a lot of it goes but I'll stop first got here. for his characters, especially the main character, Issei indeed have the nature of bad, so do not be surprised if he was much hated by many viewers. but in my opinion it was not too bad considering ecchi anime genre, and also in this anime fan service many displays. if you also read his novel light surely you also know how to pull this story. How can you not be here to see the girls who use magic, monsters, life at school, and of course the fan service that makes you watch it. Well, after seeing an outline of this anime, I do not feel tired, which is interspersed with humor, and of course it makes you want to watch it",

Story on the other hand has been some what slow paced and cliche, but there is a bunch of comedy, comparing to other cliche anime along with the harem theme, Highschool DxD have a place for competition.Why, because due to the winning side of the sexy girls plus Issei the most pervert characterout of the harem theme.

Beside him Gremory, Rias (my fav)the red hair beauty is just sexy, Himejima, Akeno (my Fav) is just a sadist straight up, is so fun to watch her to tease Iseei enough for us to laugh and enough to show her sadist-ness, so no need to say more. I know i am no doing all characters sry, but at least the two idols of the school 'The Two Onee-san' can't choose which one.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 7\\n\r\nDespite this being a cliche anime it has done well to pull it off with the comedy, and another compliment is to the seiyuu I love Akeno's seiyuu it prefect.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 8\\n\r\nAs of now 8 episodes is been fun to watch and more fun will be on its way. If you don't like nudity anime then bad luck for you, but give it a go is been enjoyable.",

            "content": "I watched this after watching Highschool of the Dead. I figured, hey, a little fan service with some character development and some interesting circumstances can go a long way towards making an anime enjoyable.\r\nYah ... and then there's Highschool DXD.\r\nThe sheer epicness of the fanservice was something I definitely was NOT prepared for. It's beat you over the head ridiculous. Every character, and by character I mean pair of boobs and legs, are large and long respectively. The 3 dudes that inhabit this world overpopulated by incredibly hot teenage girls are ... how do I put this ... idiots. And none more so than ourmain character.\\n\\n\r\nHow or why ... sigh. I won't bother. Suffice to say, Issei is a pervert and about as dense as they come. The plot's your typically, hot girl sees potential in worlds biggest loser. Loser has potential to be gamechanger, loser just has to believe in himself and his hot compadre. \\n\\n\r\nOk, to be fair, the show's got some good things going for it. The sequence where Issei gets his first date was very cute and well done, and you couldn't help but feel for him when things went really south. Also, the idea of Angels, Fallen Angels and Demons fighting each other, while not original was done with a twist, namely the incorporation of \"chess\" pieces as soldier types. Rias is a compelling enough character at first, even though this amounts to very little in the end, and her story arc is incredibly generic. Still, there's a funny episode where we see what Ash Ketchum would turn up like if he lost all his friends and lived 10 years in a demon dimension.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is beyond predictable. The harem sketches are barely amusing, and the characters while well drawn, desperately needed to be fleshed out a lot more. Pardon the expression. If the story execution was any good, this show could have been watchable. Hec even the copious amounts of fan service would not have been nearly as insulting. But as things stand, this is definitely one for people only interesting is seeing how many times animated boobs can jiggle after the rest of the body has stopped moving. That's about as interesting as the story gets.\\n\\n\r\nMy conclusion, if you're looking for a bit more out of your ecchi comedies that just panty shots and lame slapstick humor, AVOID THIS ONE!",

            "content": "While I was searching for shows to watch last year, High School DxD came up.  I was excited to watch it since the female lead was Yoko Hikasa, who is one of my favorites.  \r\nFirst of all, the nudity was annoying.  I could handle it because I've watched worse but it was still annoying...on a Strike Witches level if you know what I mean.   \r\nI liked how Kiba was there to balance out the ratio of girls vs boys in the club and how Koneko was there to counter the large busts of Rias, Akeno, and Asia.  Personally Ithink Akeno looked too plain and typical but Rias' bright red hair was pleasing to look at.  Usually demons are designed with horns, tails, and/or wings, but the demon wings in High School DxD are unique since they come from the lower back instead of from the shoulders and the way they curve is beautiful.  \\n\\n\r\nTrip ~Innocent of D~ by Larval Stage Planning and STUDYxSTUDY by StylipS were good songs but I liked STUDYxSTUDY better.  I think the ending has something to do with it.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite part of the show was the ending.  The pole dancing was an excellent touch and the fact that they were barely clothed was a rest on the eyes.  \\n\\n\r\nIn my mind I was saying \"This show is so bad...\"  The same applied to one of my favorite shows: Koe de Oshigoto!  The nudity in that anime was so bad but it was so interesting that the nudity did not matter as much.\\n\r\nHigh School DxD also reminded me of Freezing but while Freezing disturbed me with nudity, gruesome battle scenes, and f***ed up plot events, High School DxD was only slightly annoying in comparison.  There was also love at the end which I enjoy but they didn't go too far which is fine since Issei isn't worthy of Rias at the moment.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall it was an good show to watch if you can handle it.",

            "content": "Before continuing any further into this review,I would like to state that I am a female and that while this anime may be intended for a male audience,females can enjoy it as well if they don't mind ecchi. Ill begin the review now,this anime is actually how I got interested in ecchi. I think this is a great introduction to ecchi,as it has a good plot and the characters aren't bad at all,although this anime might scare people away from ecchi,it definitely isn't doesn't lacking in well done fan service scenes.\r\nStory:I really enjoyed the story,it is much better than that of many other ecchi outthere. The story got me watching at the beginning,and kept me coming back. The fan service was like an added bonus that made this anime that much better. High School DxD is known for being an ecchi anime with a plot other than \"plot\",and it really doesn't leave much to be desired (except for another season,but oh look,we already have that!). I give it a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:I enjoyed the art and liked how the characters and settings looked. Good art is,in my opinion,kind of a necessity for any ecchi anime worth watching. I really liked the fight scenes and \"plot\" scenes in particular,although it wasn't truly outstanding. I give it a 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:There isn't really much to say here,but I liked the voice acting,it really seemed to fit the characters and settings. (I watched the subbed version,so it's with the Japanese voice acting). I give it a 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:Here's where most ecchi anime are really lacking,but not High School DxD. While the characters weren't as great as they could've been,they were still enjoyable. The main character isn't overpowered and not all the girls fall for him,he sometimes needs to be saved. The girls all actually have personalities,which is nice to see in an ecchi anime,that aren't limited to cookie cutter tsundere,yandere,dandere,and all the other dere's. I give it a 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:I really,really,enjoyed this. It was amazing,it kept me coming back for more,and generally just made me glad I had time to watch it. I give this a 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:I enjoyed it a lot,and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for an ecchi with a plot,good characters,a bit of an actual love story,and plenty of \"plot\". I give it a 9/10\\n",

            "content": "I'm going to be very direct with this review.\r\nAs much as I'm not fond of ecchi and harem series, the reason why I watched this anime was basically because many people, when I started watching animes again, recommended me, they said ''ITS GOT DAH BEST PLOT EVAH''... ''Plot'' they said...\r\nThis series is just a trash, as simple as that, and I know very well many people will not agree with me. And do you know why? \r\nI'm very happy you're asking me the reason my dear unknown friend... They want to see boobs. That's it, they do not give one single duck about the plot.I don't even know if I can talk about ''the plot'' of this anime, I don't even think it has one... \\n\r\nThe three seasons are exactly equal: BOOBS, BAD PEOPLE APPEAR, BOOBS, MC DEFEATS 'EM, BOOBS, NEW BAD PEOPLE APPEAR, BOOBS, NEW CHARACTERS (oh, what a coincidence, all the new characters that are introduced, and if they belong to the MC's squad, they have to be girls... ohoho, excluiding a trap one tho...) DID I MENTION BOOBS? OH, WELL, BOOBS FOR YA.\\n\r\nThere's one last thing I wanted to point out, I seriously thought a lot about this, I even discussed about it with some friends of mine...\\n\r\n''What is it?!''\\n\r\nI'm glad you're very curious to know my dear unknown friend.\\n\r\nI called it ''The Mystery of Rias' Nips''\\n\r\nBefore I continue with that, I also have to point out another thing about this anime, which makes it even more stupid. It's the desing of Rias and Akeno, the 'hottest chicks' in the series. They both have this feature.\\n\r\n -They seriously do not look like teenagers, just look at them and compare the body with another anime girl of the same age. They will not be similar in any way. Why? of course, the unrealistic size of the boobs. This is something that I will always hate about anime girls.\\n\r\nAfter pointing that out, we can continue with ''The Mystery of Rias' Nips''\\n\r\nIt's basically, the fact that, when she's wearing the uniform, you can see very well her nips, like if she was not wearing a bra. But there are some scenes where she's being shown up with underwear, but you can see she does wear a bra... and it's like... WAT DAH DUCK DUDE?! DOES SHE WEAR A BRA OR NOT...\u00bf\u00a1\u00a1\u00bf\u00bf\u00a1\\n\\n\r\nThat's all I had to say about this anime. Do I recommend it? Of course not, please, don't watch this anime, expect if, of course, you're like one of those that don't care about the plot and just wanna see some boobs.",

            "content": "This series is surprisingly decent in spite of its entry into the ecchi genre. While having the typical elements of ecchi like our perverted male lead Issei and a good amount of fan service and perverted content rear their head, High School DxD is smart enough not to use it to cover up a flimsy plot as this baby offers a good amount of exploration into its world and devoting focus on a number of characters among Rias and her servants among the Gremory family. Issei mixes around personality traits of a pervert and the hot-blooded main lead found within shounen battle anime. While helusts for and peeps on girls, he doesn't act on his impulses and cares for the well-being of the girls he interacts with among the Gremory residence enough where he puts himself at risk to protect them. These traits are nothing new for an anime with Issei, but the series strikes a balance with these aspects to his personality so neither one gets too overbearing and obnoxious with the worst sides of these common character types.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of Issei, many of the characters in High School DxD within the series follow typical archetypes found within high school and action-type anime. Some of the characters do get some fleshing out with how they've been affected by the supernatural elements within the series such as Rias' family status with devils and Asia's equal acceptance of all types of beings making her face prejudice by those among her church. Otherwise, the majority of the cast are mostly underdeveloped and exist to fulfill the tropes they personify from high school and action-based anime, counting the irredeemable cocky and scumbag antagonists that the series introduces to create conflict in a couple arcs of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe world exploration within the series serves to explore differing elements to the supernatural world of High School DxD. Outside of devils, the series introduces a number of other magical abilities and supernatural creatures that include familiars, magical teleportation, fallen angels and dragons. Elements to being a devil within the series are decently fleshed out such as how servants are created, their weaknesses and the influence of higher families within the devil world are explored.\\n\\n\r\nThe action element to the series dabbles a bit into shounen territory with how it is handled. Many of the abilities used by the characters in the series are nothing new that has been seen in anime such as Issei's Boosted Gear looking like a knockoff of Kazuma's Shell Bullet power from s-CRY-ed and Yuto's use of a ridiculous number of swords for battle being like what Archer and Gilgamesh utilize from Fate/stay night. Also, the typical tropes of said genre such as the male lead getting a power boost in the heat of battle and refusing to give up in spite of overwhelming odds, as well as a battle game style match being utilized in a later episode. In spite of these issues, the fights are decently animated and the animators do well at covering up any shortcuts they may have utilized to get what they needed out of action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, High School DxD is a surprisingly decent offering for the ecchi genre as it mixes supernatural lore and action with its storytelling while offering the typical perverted antics of ecchi. It doesn't break any new ground and I wouldn't recommend this to those who detest the ecchi genre and/or shounen battle titles. But if you don't mind a series that dabbles into both elements without going too far in depicting them, then High School DxD may be for you.",

            "content": "This series has a lot of fan service. And I mean A LOT. It is a harem series that revolves around the life of pervy boy Issei Hyodou who becomes a pawn to the devil Rias Gremory in a literal sense after a sequence of events that alter his life forever. What follows is a story filled with many different characters that all have very different personalities. Many will probably watch it based on the amount of fan service and nudity involved but aside from that, the series does have some touching moments. The story starts out with the first few episodes explaining everything aboutwhat happens in the series to the viewer and it is easy to understand. The characters are very hilarious to watch and Issei in particular is one of the funniest characters I've seen in anime. The most enjoyment I got out of the series was Issei. He starts off as a pervy high school student who is obsessed with girls and while he still maintains that attitude throughout the entire series, he does develop more caring and protective attributes that make him such a more likable character. The action is pretty exciting to watch as Issei starts off the weakest and gets more and more powerful as the series progresses. There are a lot of cases where the ecchi aspects of the series that are placed in just for fan service and nothing more. But all and all the series in highly enjoyable. If you want to watch it for the ecchi, harem theme then you won't be disappointed, though the series does become more than just an ecchi series filled with boobs. The story is great, the characters are hilarious, the action is exciting, and each episode is fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nLikes:\\n\r\n-Issei is hilarious, just him talking and the stuff that he says is some of the funniest things I've heard in anime\\n\r\n-Koneko is also hilarious and completely savage towards Issei and his perversions\\n\r\n-Rias and Issei's emotion towards protecting each other and their friends is pretty powerful, despite how cliched it is\\n\r\n-How badass Issei gets towards the end, its pretty exciting\\n\\n\r\nDislikes:\\n\r\n-The amount of boob you see, at some your just like, \"Really?\"\\n\r\n-The Devil, Fallen Angel, Angel feud is cluttered in the first season and doesn't make a whole lot of sense",

This anime combined seriousness and comedy in the exact same scene which is very hard to do. I am very impressed. Very impressed indeed. The art is very suitable for the anime. The plot is great and when I say plot, I meanBOTH the story plot and the ... uhm... other type...  It has many different options which will later increase as you go along the story. It also includes religion in a very interesting and unique way as well as the afterlife. This anime has inspired me deeply and it hasn't gone away, even after 4 years.",

            "content": "A lot of people tend to categorize High School DxD as the over the top ecchi/ harem anime that simply wasted all of its budget on animating the tits of the female characters, however I think that as anime watchers we should stop stereotyping and remove the facade that we have placed upon animes in the genre and come to accept the true dignity and beauty of anime's such as High School DxD. The human passion of lust and women is translated into Issei as he attempts to reach his life goal of \"becoming the harem king\" and this triggers a series of character developmentas well as a surprisingly good plot for a ecchi anime, with of course abundant boob action that you will see for like 30% of every episode. If nudity or tits just aren't your cup of tea, then i suggest that you stop reading  and drop the series because trust me this anime consists of soft core porn left,right and center.\\n\\n\r\nNow this well be extremely surprising but this anime has QUITE A GOOD STORY-LINE. Yes you are probably thinking wtf am i saying however after watching a tonne of anime's in the same genre i can assure you that that the storyline that High School DxD conjures is far superior  to the likes of Date A Live and Trinity Seven. There is simply a lot more depth within the story as everything happens for a specific purpose and i found the presentation of these events were done extremely well with good pacing and context. In DxD we follow a high school boy and his two horny friends who show their love for boobs and girls just like typical pubescent boys at that age. However ironically Issei's love for girls is what gets him killed on his first date and he is then resurrected by demon princess Rias Gremory, hence exposing Issei to the world of Demons and Angels. From here we see Issei mature as a devil and contribute abundantly to the plot of High School DxD through both his boosted gear and his perverted conceptions which simply balance out a the storyline with intense and emotional battles and events as well a good serving of fan-service that we all love.  However many do also question the originality of such a series  and here is where i can to prove to you that Dxd is second to none. High School DxD is the predecessor of all other harem animes within the 21st century with animes such as Dakara boku wa H ga Dekinai and Shinmai Maou no testament, using the concept of DxD in their series.Plus  the light novels were released way before most other Harem series so you can bank on its originality. Overall i found the storyline to be a solid 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Character Development in High School DxD is also on point as you see Issei mature from being a perverted teenager who got hit hard by puberty, to a hardworking and headstrong character. All the characters are versatile and served some purpose towards the storyline, For starters we have the exquisite President Rias Gremory whose traits are reflected in Issei through the close bond that they share. Moving on we have the sadistic Akeno and the cute loli- neko character of Koneko, both of whom have strong personalities and are simply aesthetic to the series itself. Then we have Asia who brings the aspect of innocence into DxD through her caring and soft personality which contributes so much to the character development of the other members and Issei. Finally we have Kiba who is the other male member of club that is a complete opposite to Issei in both personality and mentality and his character brings about the sense of normality within series. So in the midst of all the big boobs and nosebleeds i saw the characters all fitting perfectly into the plot of DxD as they each serve a different purpose (made through the analogy of chess pieces) and are extremely likeable from the get go. Perfect 10 in my opinion\\n\\n\r\nThe Art department was quite mediocre, yeah the character designs were quite good and \"appealing\" but they were too generic and the animation was quite average as well. However plus points awarded to sound as both the Opening and Ending theme songs are quite catchy even though I'm sure,  some people would consider it JRock trash. The soundtracks used also matched the scenes accordingly, especially at the intermission where they show you two juicy frames of quality fan service accompanied with a nice jingle that would generate raging hard on's. So overall I would give the Art a 7/10 and the sound a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nNow in terms on enjoyment, High School DxD is practically the best ecchi/haremi anime i have seen, almost everything about this anime  kept my attention, from the big jiggling boobs to the intense fight scenes and of course the incessant comedy that Issei is able generate from almost everything he does. Yet despite all these external elements you can still enjoy a good storyline that is easy to follow and comprehend in High School DxD as well as make a connection to all the different characters and understand them as viewers. This was also the 3rd anime i ever watched so it has quite some nostalgic value as well. Easily earns a 10 from me\\n\\n\r\nOverall i am willing to defy the views of all haters who think DxD is a pile of shit in the ecchi department and say that it is one of the best instead, hence the overall score i gave it being a 10. I enjoyed the series alot and have also watched season 2 and 3 which are as equally as good. I recommend this to anyone who can tolerate ecchi, because trust me you are missing out on truly one of the best series in the genre,\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "High School DxD, is somewhat a very controversial series, that you're dared to speak its name out loud in public, but then again, let's ask the fans, are you watching it for the plot, or for your twisted perverted inner self? sometimes, a good story can be disguised by a hard to knock off skin, in this case, the over the top fanservice, but is there a worthy plot to follow under this still? The one thing I'm sure of is that there is a fine line between Ichi Anime, and straight up Hentai, and High School DxD could be one of the rare fewthat lie upright on that line.\\n\\n\r\n- Story (6.0/10):\\n\r\nI really can't milk anything out of this, spaghetti piece of fiction, the plot revolves around conflicts between Demons, Angles, and Fallen angels but with a twist being that 90% of the cast are naked erotic girls, with the majority being underaged which is dangerous on its own.\\n\r\nOur main character is the typical pervert protagonist, whose only care in the world is to build a Harem of his own, and I'd dare every 13 years old teen to not want the same!\\n\r\nOur Protagonist, Issei is on the demons side, blessed with a powerful gear that all the others thrive to possess, but of course it couldn't be in the possession of anybody else rather than a typical never-give-up teen who can't think of anything innocent in a straight time without several perverted thought breaks every 10 seconds.\\n\\n\r\n- Art (8.0/10):\\n\r\nUnlike the hardly engaging plot, the animation is at least decent to amazing, the focus, of course, goes to the erotic female anatomy, and half of the budget is gone into animating those jiggly breast movements that appeared to be strongly defying the law of basic physics every friction of muscle magic, next time they are going to be in accordance of one's blinking, I can see that coming at least.\\n\r\nThe animation is mostly fine, I can go for long without being bored looking at those amazing swordfights, and let's be real here, I'm a normal guy, so the \u201cNATURAL\u201d jiggly reactions on \u201cCERTAIN\u201c body parts are provoking as well.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\\n\r\nProbably the only memorable aspect of this, I could go for long periods of time and still recall this amazing overwhelming soundtrack, and I can already feel the nostalgia of it, I don't know, there is just something  about the smooth violin notes that tingle me, giving me goosebumps every so often, or so that the action displayed on the screen itself.\\n\r\nThe Opening them song was okay, nothing to praise or anything, but it's the OST where the glory is at.\\n\\n\r\n- Character (5.0/10):\\n\r\nSadly, I couldn't find characters that click to me, characters whom I care about, and pray to not get harmed or killed, everybody is a comic relief punching bag especially the protagonist, there are absolutely no noticeable traits to remember rather than the yet erotic body bumps on the female cast. You could literally make a fortune out of somebody pillows here.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.5/10):\\n\r\nDespite its many downfalls, I would be a lier if I said I hated this show, I genuinely had fun watching this, and I'm coming straight up, no, not because of the plot, not because of the characters either, while the OST was phenomenal, excuse my vulgar language, the fanservice was what kept me going, I'm not a creep, and I don't get boners from watching 2D characters, but this one had me rooting for the main character, a simpleton that lost his way to the order of the baldy twins, something about him that's relatable.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall (7.0/10):\\n\r\nI would never recommend watching this with family, only close friends, this is no way family friendly, and honestly, sometimes it's more of another hentai than the Anime it was meant to be, or maybe, it's just not the hentai it was meant to be.\\n\r\nUnless you're in for some fanservice, and lighthearted comedy, do not breach into this expecting a masterpiece or a story to remember.",

            "content": "High School DXD is an ecchi/harem icon. If you are a fan of good storytelling punctuated with fanservice then DXD is for you. Some opinions fault DXD for being non-canonical with the manga or having too little story. The ecchi/harem tag can definitely create this illusion of a lack of storytelling, and sometimes critics are correct. However, DXD does an extremely good job at finding the right combination of content and fanservice making DXD very special. DXD found a way to advance its story in every episode instead of using filler episodes like most ecchis. It's also important to remember that an anime is ananime, and not a manga. Seperate animals should be treated and designed a bit differently. In this way, some deviation from the manga is permissible and understandable as coming too close to the manga could lead the animated version into pitfalls. All in all, DXD is a must watch.\\n\\n",

            "content": "STORY - 5\r\nART - 6\r\nSOUND - 7\r\nCHARACTER - 6\r\nENJOYMENT - 6\r\nHigh School DxD qualifies as one of those anime that could be analogical to an attention-seeker. But kind of in a good and bad way. Eroticism fed through an occult world of demons and angels, that's a formula to garner people seeking to experience some spellbinding hormonal action.\r\nThere's no denying that DxD is an ecchi harem with the implementation of a story. Rather than just drawing interest with fan service, it mingled around with some interesting concepts that had their own generic charms. Frankly speaking, the religious and noble aspects only blanketed what became amediocre plot with a solid foundation but a weak structure. And the fact this show seemed to take its story seriously befell its true potential. No, I really can't turn my brain off or whatever as the show kept on trying to be impactful with its unfolding events. Honestly, the lackluster execution and the contrived reasonings with dull build-ups failed to evoke emotions in some of the more sentimental or badass scenes. It didn't helped that any tension quickly wavered in fights, especially with the bland motives of the antagonists who just spew out clich\u00e9d one-liners in the areas of \"Masaka!\". So really, the meat of the content was too undercooked but at least the surface was pretty crisp. While that progression failed, the characterization managed to succeed in place of it. In the Occult Research Club, the characters there all had their own interesting traits. A perverted boy goes through quite a bit of change through his relationships with other characters. Even when he has a really strong power, the fact he needed to train himself to use it and his willingness to do so left behind a kind-hearted value to his personality. Another great trait was the blending of ecchi with action, with his perversion serving as quite a leading role in breaking barriers. \\n\\n\r\nThe whole art looked pretty average other than for a couple of quirky appeals. There was this lingering fantasy lighting that filled up many of the scenes. Orange and red washouts from candles and magical powers, it's an extra something to be immersed with a churchly feel. Character designs also fitted the fantasy setting although the oversized breast sizes didn't really suit my taste, but that's a subjective thing and I'm sure a lot of ecchi fans liked it for the attention-grabbing nature that they possessed. Other than the fact that the animation was heightened up in action along with ecchi scenes, having empowering jiggling physics or bombardment of powers from the magics, it generally was nothing special with a blocky kind of movement going on. There were a lot of provoking angles that spiced up the fan service aspect that all ecchi must have. In the sound sector, each characters maintained their personality well with their voices, although it may have gotten a bit too melodramatic in the later episodes. A collection of good soundtracks gets the fight going with the dramatic and orchestral undertones to highlight the action. Also, the reverberating vibes of the \"Boost!\" that goes on whenever the perverted boy was using his power was another appealing thing. Might be random but I loved the echoing feel of it as it sent this pulsing shockwaves that goes through my whole body.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end, the potential is there, definitely. It's only the first season but High School DxD has its world set in stone and the history is briefly seen. Now, if only the execution can be improved on, it will become a sexy anime in all of its aspects.",

            "content": "Before I get into this video I just wanna say that a couple month\u2019s ago Mother\u2019s Basement made a fantastic video on YouTube as to why Highschool DxD has such a huge fanbase and is so damn marketable. I highly recommend that you watch his video before reading this review becuase it's a great video but also because I don\u2019t plan on repeating everything he said word for word.  The only times I\u2019ll echo what he said in his video is if it\u2019s directly related to why I love this show, because that\u2019s what this video is going to be about.  With thenew season currently airing, I figured it\u2019d be an ample time to make a video about this wonderful show, and this might be long because there\u2019s lots of reasons why I find this anime appealing.  The most obvious reason is the fanservice, and I\u2019m sure that most people, once reading the title of this video, have already typed that in the comments, however I think it\u2019s incredibly ignorant to suggest that this is the ONLY reason the show is good.  \\n\\n\r\nYes, the fanservice is amazing, it\u2019s arguably my favorite fanservice anime.  Every girl in the entire show are incredibly cute and/or sexy, and considering that they have varying character designs and personalities, the show is able to easily appeal to many different kinds of fetishes.  Similar to Monster Musume, but not exactly the same, because that show appeals to fetishes primarily because it utilizes monster girls.  However, the boobs and the different fetishes in the show, as Mother\u2019s Basement already discussed in his video, is part of the marketing of the show, and while I\u2019d be lying if I said that it isn\u2019t a big reason as to why I enjoy the show, it\u2019s not the entire reason.  While a promise of bobs would get people to watch the show, if the story and characters weren\u2019t good, then people would largely forget about it after it finished airing, which clearly hasn\u2019t happened due to the light novels still being ongoing and the anime adaptation being on it\u2019s fourth season now without any signs of loosing steam, and even spawned a blatant, crappier knockoff which began serialization the same year that the first season of the anime began.  \\n\\n\r\nThe standard Love Hina, Negima, Nisekoi, or Monster Musume harem anime doesn\u2019t really have much of a shelf life past one, or maybe two seasons if it\u2019s really good.  The female characters in Highschool DxD, despite obviously being drawn for the purpose of making guys horny, are likable and interesting, more so than a series like this probably required.  Rias Gremory is my personal favorite, and I think I\u2019ve found that most people feel the same way.  When I first started watching the show I thought she\u2019d be the token Tsundere, but she actually isn\u2019t.  She does have a hard exterior and slowly warms up to the main character over the course of the show, but she isn\u2019t a complete bitch who beats the shit out of him for no reason whatsoever.  And the thing is, unlike in most harem anime, she would have a perfectly good reason for wanting to beat Issei to a pulp because he actually is an extremely perverted character, unlike most harem leads who are generally good guys and just accidentally walk into compromising situations, and the girls beat them up based on misunderstandings.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, Issei does get his ass handed to him by a lot of the girls in the show, but Rias is almost never one of them.  \\n\\n\r\nAkeno Himejima is good if you\u2019re into overly pushy dominatrix's, and both Asia and Koneko are good if you\u2019re into lollies.  Also, Asia fits the nun fetish, which yes, believe it or not, that is a fetish, and Koneko fits the catgirl fetish in some scenes.  Asia\u2019s story is a bit tragic because she was originally a nun for the church who Rias turned into a demon after she died, and Koneko is the token Tsundere who does tend to beat Issei up whenever he\u2019s acting pervy, but isn\u2019t nearly as obnoxious as most Tsunderes.  None of the the girls are incredibly complex, but they are deep and interesting enough to keep viewers invested beyond just the bouncing boobs.  Also, the primary romantic interest in the series is obviously Rias.  And that segues me into the next thing that\u2019s great about the show, the romance.  I actually liken the romance in this show to Chivalry of a Failed Knight, which came out in 2016.  It doesn\u2019t have the most realistic romance ever, but it nevertheless feels genuine, and is incredibly engrossing.  \\n\\n\r\nIn fact all of the drama, despite not technically being absolutely necessary to hook people in, is engaging, and I want to see what the outcome is going to be.  While I never really have the fear that any of the main cast are going to die, and STAY dead, I still find it very enjoyable.  Especially the end of season 3, which finally had Rias and Issei kissing for the first time.  From what I\u2019ve heard that was supposed to happen later in the light novels, and for some reason they fast tracked it in the anime adaptation, but that doesn\u2019t bother me, because it was nice to see.  Another part of the show\u2019s appeal is the fight scenes.  In fact, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to call this a shonen battle show.  The fights bank on well animated, face paced, intense action, with tones of unique superpowers to be used against each other, and characters no only getting physically stronger but also growing as characters as they continue fighting, it\u2019s just like a standard shonen battle anime.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother reason the show is so appealing, at least to me, is how it incorporates real world mythologies into its world building, specifically Norse Mythology, which is my favorite type of mythology.  While there are random devils that aren\u2019t from any mythology, Norse Gods such as Loki and Odin, among others.  The show also represents Lucifer, Beelzebub, Leviathan, and Asmodeus, four infamous demons from the Christian Bible.  This next point is something that Mother\u2019s Basement said in his video, but I feel like echoing it because it\u2019s pertinent as to why I love this show, and that has to do with the type of girls that the show provides.  Harems have become extremely over saturated over the years, and because of that, in order to extend their shelf life as much as possible, writers figured out that they have to create some sort of unique twists with the girls in order to keep people interested.  \\n\\n\r\nSome shows make the girls aliens, such as with the classic Tenchi Muyo and the piece of garbage DearS, others make them monster girls, such as Interviews With Monster Girls, the wonderfully lewd Monster Musume, and, let\u2019s be honest, a shit tone of modern day harems, and others decide to make the girls angels and/or demons, such as with the underrated classic Shuffle, and of course Highschool DxD.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe benefit of making the girls something that isn\u2019t human is that the characters don\u2019t have to abide by human morals, because morality, after all, is nothing more than a man made thing, and opinions about such things could be different to other species.  Not to mention, regarding the demon girls of HIghschool DxD, you would expect demons to have extremely loose, or perhaps even non existent, morals, when it comes to age, status, family, and anything else that you could possibly think of.  While the show makes it clear that these demons, or at the very least Rias, does have a concept of romance, it\u2019s also made very clear that she wants Issei\u2019s dick inside of her, which for many people might make it more acceptable because she\u2019s a demon.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd I think that also makes the loli fanservice with both Asia and Koneko less creepy, although that definitely won\u2019t be the case with everyone.  Miina Tepes from the anime series Dance in the Vampire Bund is also a good example for this, although that one isn\u2019t actually a harem anime.  I think that pretty much sums up every reason that I love Highschool DxD.  It\u2019s an absolutely amazing show, and I\u2019m so glad that season 4 is currently airing.  At the time of this writing I haven\u2019t started watching it yet, but I will very soon.  I think it\u2019s kind of a misunderstood show, due to the fanservice, which is really sad and unfair, because I feel that this is one of the few fanservice anime that has something for just about everyone.",

So as you can tell i love this anime and I hope that they continue with it.\\n",

            "content": "First off, I don't want to start off this review by saying \"Oh my God,this is completely not what I expected at all and is is a fantastic series!!!\" because everyone starts it off like that even though it is the truth...................wow, I screwed that up. I think I'll just move on to my opinions then.\r\nStory:7\r\nAt the start, a high school ecchi is probably the most unbelievable, most overused story ever made with it unsurprisingly focusing around a perverted main character and a bunch of sexy girls around him. So with shows like this, it's important to add plot elements which make the story it'sown, and demons and devils didn't seem to be all that interesting to me. But as the series progressed, I found myself strangely intrigued by plots such as devils going up against fallen angels, and full demons having to marry other full demons to keep the bloodline going as there are so few of them. I can't give it more than a seven though as without the characters and how well they're developed, it would just be a bore.\\n\r\nScore:7\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nUsage of colour is done fantastically. Scenes with very little colour are able to stand out well even though it may be just red and black as it's primary pallet. Characters stand out extremely well in these backgrounds as well even though their colours are pretty much the same as the background. School scenes look vibrant and add some much needed bright colours to the overall dark colour scheme. Animation works well with characters moving brilliantly and fights look great.\\n\r\nScore:8\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes soon came very likeable for me after I got used to them. The orchestral pieces used throughout the series sound great and fit in really well, often making me feel melancholic or made the atmosphere feel sexy. I hate the sound effect the breasts make though when they're bouncing around. They just sound like big milk sacks (and I don't want idiots commenting saying \"well they ARE big milk sacks\" or \"it's used in lots of ecchi's so shut up\", I don't care, it's annoying and it grates). Maybe some of the tunes are a bit too overused though, or that might be me.\\n\r\nScore:8\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThis is what really makes this series shine. The amount of development that is able to go into twelve episodes is great and you have sense of what all the characters are like by the end of it. It's not rushed either though as the characters already have a bit of personality in them (not like Megan Fox or Katie Price). Anyway, all the characters end becoming likeable with Issei wanting to help out Rias, a love triangle with Issei, Rias and Asia forming and Akeno's sadist manner adding depth to all of the main cast. The supporting cast however or more in to fill the gap in characters it seems as they are more annoying than anything else.\\n\r\nScore:9\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAfter starting off with a recycled plot line, this series ends up becoming a extremely lovable series which makes you want another series. Anyone who is a fan of shows like Sora no Otoshimono will enjoy.\\n\r\nScore:9 \\n\\n\r\nOverall:9\\n",

I\u2019ll give the story a 8 it was fun to watch and never gave me a dull moment with no clich\u00e9 harem plot + the main character is a total bad ass\r\nWhen I first watched high school dxd Iwatched it dubbed .

Trust me by episode 4 you'll be thinking \"WHY did I watch this.\"\r\nAnyway the plot and story are kind of cool which is why I rate it a 7, but it's REALLY perverted, like more than Girls Bravo if you've ever seen it. So basically there's a perverted high school boy and he wants to get a girlfriend and he does. She turns out to be a Fallen Angel (bad guy)and kills him. Another Fallen Angel kills him again later. Both times he's miraculously saved by the red-haired girl he saw. So in exchange for being saved he has to be a Devil and serve under Rias, the red-haired girl. U put that because people get angry if there's no summary in the review even though there's a summary right above the reviews spot.\\n\\n\r\nSo it's a 7/10. Have fun watching it if you want to.",

            "content": "So. This was my first harem anime. Very weird. Second ecchi. My friend, Kleo, said this was a \"trashy\" show and I see what she meant; it really is. But that seems to be what ecchi is about; it's tits and ass. Maybe others also have a perverted lead, Issei, who has a dream of being a \"Harem King\". This essentially means that he wants to have a bunch of subordinate women whom he can command. Kind of creepy. But...\r\nIf you can look past all of the sexual stuff, this show is actually pretty cool. The other lead, Rias Gremory, is a gorgeous princess ofthe demon nobility (did I mention that this show is about demons, fallen angels and angels?) who is the best and most interesting character. Issei and Asia are, in my opinion, respectively too perverted to enjoy and too boring. Rias is very honest about her thoughts and actions, and I liked that she accepted things as they were and did not try to change people, even her subordinates. At her core, all Rias wants is to be loved for her personality and not her family name and power. It's hard to not love her for that because she is really fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nThe other friends of the leads, who are also part of Rias's team: Akeno is Rias's second in command, a sadist with a cute and friendly exterior. Kiba is a handsome and popular schoolmate and is the kind of guy that Issei wishes he could be, Koneko is a reserved and loyal girl who looks young. \\n\\n\r\nIf you can look past the obvious fan-service and Issei's constant need to look at naked girls, then you might actually enjoy this show. Indeed, if you want to see both then you will love it because it has plenty of naked and semi-naked girls. While unnecessary, it turns out that this does have relevance to the story in a way that was, frankly, stupidly brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you can't look past how perverted Issei is, and trust me it took me a few episodes, then consider this; when you were in high school, how badly did you want to see naked girls and how badly did you want to have sex? \\n\r\nGranted, it won't be as badly and I hope you won't be as weird about Issei, but thinking about some of the lengths you went to in your youth to get a girl to notice you or to get porn before the internet etc, you will sympathise with him a bit. Very little because he is really desperate. He is actually well known at the school for being a pervert.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, this was the first anime that I felt the need to review. I've reviewed a few games, books and movies before. I hope you decide to watch this because there was more to it than hot girls.",

The MC (main character) begins as a normal human, but when he dies, Rias Gremory revives him, which turns him into a devil. The story is really good, and I'm impressed that it already has three seasons! (High School DxD, High School DxD born, High School DxD New)I will definitely stick around for High School DxD Born! Anyway, back on task. High School DxD is a mix between a harem, comedy, action, and ecchi. According to my equations, Harem+Comedy+Action+Ecchi= HighSchool DxD. High School DxD equals a great anime. I would love to see a anime get on High School DxD's level, because they will get rekt.",

Basically, if Issei is a normal Japanese teenager i am French. So skip forward 10 minutes Issei has been killed by a fallen angel and has been resurrected by a demon called Titus Mammary, sorry, i meant Rias Gremory who is the part of the Infamous Gremory Clan because they took one look at her sizeable breasts and said 'Yepthat's a main character'. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is quite good, it obviously has a good budget behind it and while the assets might be a bit cliche (typical fantasy affair) they are well designed and the fight scenes are well choreographed and some i dare say are exciting\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nWhy is this a thing that can be rated? The people that watch this show don't care about sound unless it's the sound that the characters breasts make as they bounce together, the background music could be Barry Manilows greatest hits and they would still rate it 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI will now try to sum up the characters in as few words as possible because i want to put as much effort into their character design as the author did\\n\\n\r\nIssei: Man who likes boobs very much becomes a demon and is basically the modern day equivalent of Jesus except more perverted and Japanese\\n\\n\r\nRias: Boobs\\n\\n\r\nAkeno: Cow boobs\\n\\n\r\nKuroka: There is more people than that?\\n\\n\r\nKoneko: Josh who is this person?

            "content": "Now before I begin, I just wanna say that that this show is so far in the I would say fuck this shit hell no, i'd rather die than watch a stupid ecchi! but after hearing why so many people like this show, I gave it a try and I was so hooked I marathoned all three seasons in about a week. \r\nStory- Our story begins with pervert Issei, and his two friends. you could basically call them the tit squad cause that's all they really are lol. but Issei is obsessed with titties like its no ones business. but he can't get a chickto save his life. one day a chick asks him out on a dateand everything's smooth right?... Well he dies, he gets assassinated by the hot chick he went on a date with! his life is saved by a devil called Reis Gremmery ( grand master tits!). from there on Issei is Reis's servant as a devil. The story is actually pretty good for being a stupid concept. it reminds me a lot of gurren lagann, in a sense, YOU CAN'T TAKE THIS ANIME SERIOUSLY! BRAIN, OFFFF!!!! This show is supposed to be fun and to enjoy its story, you can't think into it, you gotta just sit back, turn off your brain and just prepare to laugh, see some titties and be amazed at how the ohh's and awhhh's of the show, cause that's how you enjoy this story.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation- the animation for high school DxD is solid but there's nothing super about I can point out about. the boobs look good and I didn't expect anything less because that's what the show is trying to show off. it's not perfect, but it gets the job done.\\n\\n\r\nSound- To be completely honest, I really didn't think much of the show's music at first. but after seeing a youtube review from Holden review's, although he despised the show, which is fine, the show is deff not meant for everybody, pointed out the amazing music to the show, so I checked it out myself and after rewatching the show with the soundtrack in mind, I can safely say that it is FUCKING AWESOME! The sound for this show is so perfect, I almost wanna say that I like the sound as much or more than the show. It sells the scenes, with orchestra, some awesome badass music and some DECENT opening and endings. nothing that special\\, although season three has a cool opening. the endings are always sexual, especially the stripper ending one.\\n\\n\r\nCharecters- I personally enjoyed all of the charecters of High school DxD. Issei is a loveable main character, who never fails to make me laugh my ass off. His passion for being the harem king is amazing. Reis, is mainly just a pair of tits for the first season, but after watching three seasons, I can safely say she's starts developing nicely. Akkano, being Reis's right hand servant/queen (all the servants are ranked as pieces of a chess board) is a pretty good character, probably the most seductive character I have seen in my whole life. Needless to say she is VERY well eveloped by season three so she is a very good character. now those three will be as far as I will go, because if I wanted to talk about everyone in the show I would be hear for god damn ever, but needless to say the show has a wide variety of fun charecters that all get some nice development, could be better for some.\\n\\n\r\nNow as for my enjoyment, this is where the show shows its true potential. This show made me laugh so hard one moment, made me say, HOLY SHIT the next second you'll be seeing a story unfold. Now needless to say this show did have a few problems I couldn't ignore. My biggest problem with this show is that when it tries to be serious it gets too caught up in fanservice to show a serious discussion scene. that annoys me being that the show had some seriously awesome moments that unfortunately gets foreshadowed by all the god damn tits and ass in your face all the time. my only other beef with this show is after season two. everything feels rushed as hell. like slow down man holy crap. but I can say that season in respect does have a really cool plot. Overall, I can honestly say that this show is without a doubt a unique blend of action comedy and harem/ecchi. if you want to have the full enjoyment out this show, you have to understand the show is meant to just be a barrel of fun. Oh, my only other beef is I never understand whats going with the romance between charecters half the time. overall, if your in the mood for a total non sensical fun? then enjoy and look no further. However if you can't turn your brain off and enjoy the show for what it is, then avoid at all cost.\\n\\n\r\nscore: 9/10",

            "content": "Based on the light novels by Ichiei Ishibumi, HighSchool DxD is a 12 episode anime series produced by TNK and released in 2012. The story focuses on Issei Hyoudou, a recently human turned devil and servant to one of the most popular girls in his school, Rias Gremory. It then turns into Issei dealing with the three factions of Christianity and to accomplish his never ending quest: to become the \"Harem King!\"\r\nStory: 7\r\nAs stated, the series is about Issei Hyoudou, an average perverted second year high school student at the former all girl school Kuoh Academy. Then one day, Issei meets a mysterious girl namedYuuma Amano, who confesses to Issei and becomes his first girlfriend. At this point, Issei is riding high. This does not last long, as after their first date together, Yuuma attacks Issei and then leaves him to die. Then, the next day, Issei believes that his death was just a dream and goes onto school as if nothing is wrong. However, Issei soon finds out that nobody remembers who Yuuma is or that she was his girlfriend (her number was even erased from his phone). It is then that later that night, Issei begins to experience strange things happening to himslef. He can see in the dark as if it were day, he can hear people from very far away, and he can jump much farther. Things begin to take a turn for the worse as our young hero is soon attacked by a strange man who has the same black wings that Yuuma possessed and the same method of attack as well. It is at that moment, that Issei is saved by one of the \"Two Great Onne-Samas\" of Kuoh Academy and his senior, Rias Gremory. However, all he sees is his rescue and nothing more before he passes out. Th next day, Issei wakes up to what he thinks is just another dream. However, he soon finds himself in a state of undress (in the nude) and right beside him Rias Gremory in a similar state as him. This surprises Issei and causes him to freak out a bit, causing the girl to wake and act extremely calm, even though she is naked in front of a boy. She then reveals that she is a devil and that Issei is now her new devil servant. End of episode one. \\n\\n\r\nAnd my reaction: ...I'm sorry, what? Honestly that came as a surprise. The whole thing with Yuuma was rather unexpected and while the main character dying and be resurrected is nothing new in an anime, most of those characters knew they were killed, while Issei was kept in the dark about it, only to be told that he is now a devil and servant by a naked girl who is not shying away. Not a bad way to be told you got killed in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSo from there, we go into story that focuses about how Issei is dealing with his new resurrected state, his dealings with the three factions of Christianity (devils, angels, and fallen angels), and his quest to rise up the ranks and become a high-class devil so that he may achieve his dream of becoming the \"Harem King!\". Now my overall opinion on the story is that I do actually like it. The plot of an average kid thrown into a world of the supernatural is not new in the slightest, but HighSchool DxD does it in a way to give it a charm. It also has much more dramatic moments than most would give it credit for. It can switch from a comedic story into a dramatic story and does it very nicely as well. The story is also a lot deeper and more complex than I think most would like to admit as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:7\\n\r\nThe studio that produced and released this series is TNK, better known for the anime adaptation to Ikki Tousen, Kannazuki no Miko, and *shudders* School Days. TNK is really that well known for having great animation or artistic achievements. However, this has to be one of their better looking titles in those terms. The animation for HighSchool DxD is very pleasing to the eye and has rather well done motion, especially in the jiggling of breasts, fight scenes that were energetic, intense, and well done. The art is also very beautiful in my opinion, as there is a mixture of colors that make the show pop out. The character models here have been done with great care. The female cast here are made to look sexy, beautiful, cute, and stick out, and boy do they ever. Each girl is looks differently and each are memorable in their own ways. And while the animation is rather nice and pleasing, it's not top-tier stuff. I also have to mention that the ending is one of the most well animated and eye pleasing endings I have seen.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:8\\n\r\nOne of the reasons I liked this show was because of its soundtrack. I have Ryosuke Nakanishi to thank for that as he made this soundtrack rather memorable. While Ryosuke could have gone a more traditional route and had more harem, ecchi, comedy music to go to this series, he chose a different route. He instead gives the soundtrack a rather more dramatic, movie like, and orchestral feeling to it. And what makes it work and memoralbe is that each piece gives atmosphere to the scene that it is being played with. Two examples I like to bring up are Rias Gremory's theme, a slow and beautiful piece that gives off a rather melancholic feeling to it, and Beautiful Red, an intense and fast paced piece played during critical moments of the show and gives off a rather orchestral feeling when it is played. Overall, the music for HighSchool DxD is very well done and memorable at that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:7\\n\r\nAnother aspect that I liked about this series was its characters. The characters are rather interesting to watch as each one is rather distinctive. And although this is a harem show, right now only two girls are really in love with Issei. Also, they don't fight over Issei as much as other harem anime do. They love him, and get jealous when he is with another girl, but they are not obsessed with him and fight over him at any given moment, but they also just live their lives normally. I really don't see that done a lot in this genre of anime.\\n\\n\r\nFirst let us talk about our main character. As stated, Issei Hyoudou is your average perverted high school student who is resurrected into a devil after he is killed. While he first starts off as a perverted, breast loving teenager...he still is that, but he also develops as the series goes on. You see that besides being perverted, he is kind, compassionate, brave, and a hard working guy. He also provides a lot of comedy for the show as being the butt monkey a lot. He is also willing to go to the extreme to protect his friends and loved ones. Like with Rias, he sacrificed his arm to help save her from a terrible fate and he charged through several exorcists to save Asia. But what I liked about him is that he is much different from a lot of harem main protagonists. The reason is that he actually admits he is perverted and he is not ashamed of this fact. Most other harem MC will follow a similar pattern: they are nice guys which attracts the girls, get nervous when they see a girl naked or anything like that, faints or passes out because of that. Issei does not do that: he will faint once or twice if sees a girl naked, but that is due to him getting a nose bleed. He also admits that he wants a harem, unlike a lot of other MCs. And despite his perversity (which I don't mind), he is rather well done character and a nice guy. He also created one of the greatest anime powers ever: \"Dress Break\".\\n\\n\r\nSecond on our list is the lovely female lead, Rias Gremory. Rias is the heiress to the noble house of Gremory, one of the remaining devil houses in the underworld. While one might expect here to be rather arrogant and stuck up because of her noble background, that isn't the case for her at all. Rias is a kind, compassionate, and caring individual. She loves her servants like they were own family and will not allow anyone to harm them (god save whoever has). And while she fell in love with Issei, it was more of a progressing love. Her feelings towards him were a little brother type of love in the beginning. It soon began to develop as time went on and when Issei told her that he liked her for who she was: not Rias Gremory the heiress, but Rias Gremory his master. Her love continued to grow as he kept fighting for to free her of an arranged marriage which she had no desire to go through with and never gave up even as his body was broken and beaten and finally reached its climax when Issei literally charged in during her engagement party and declared that her virginity was his and then fights her fiancee to free her from the marriage. Rias is the type of female lead that I can really like for her actions, personality, and looks.\\n\\n\r\nThe third big character to talk about is Asia Argento.Asia was originally a nun from the church who was revered for her healing abilities, but was one day cast out and excommunicated when she healed a devil without knowing. When she moves to Japan, she comes across Issei who helps her out. Then, during another encounter, she finds out that Issei is a devil but she tries to dismiss that fact as she knows that Issei is a good person at heart and her first real friend. After a series of events, Asia is resurrected and is brought into Rias's peerage. Asia in general is a sweet, innocent, caring young girl. She is very naive, which is taken advantaged of by her new school friend that she make. Asia is a also very devoted to Issei and loves him deeply, and will become sad if anything were to happen to him. In fact she is so devoted that she helped him when he was creating his \"Dress Break\" move by using it on her (to which she happily agreed to do so). \\n\\n\r\nWith the villains of this show, they're there. The come in, do what they do, and leave. That's not to say they are bad villains, just that they make the arc go along and will be defeated as the arc ends. But I did enjoy them such as Freed, the psycho priest banished from the church because he loved cutting up devils and humans too much; Raynare, Issei's first girlfriend and a rather cold hearted bitch; and Raiser, one of the children from the house of Phoenix who is Rias's fiancee and a rather arrogant ass to boot as well. Like I said, the villains aren't bad, they're there to help the story progress farther. And in all honestly, I like that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8\\n\r\nHighSchool DxD is one of my favorite series to this day. It has comedy, a story line that is deeper and much better than your average harem anime, and great characters. While it does have its faults, such as some character not getting as developed as others or some animation problems, the show is very good and is recommended by me. However, if you are turned off by ecchi things and harems, then this show is not for you. But if you can, just try it out, you may like it.",

            "content": "Grab a box of tissues, pull that old crusty sock out from under the bed, and get ready for an anime that makes me happy I invest in Kleenex stocks. High School DxD is the once in a lifetime anime that reminds us all that girls have boobs and as a guy, I sure do love boobs. In fact, in a market oversaturated with no boobs whatsoever, it\u2019s nice to find an anime that finally caters to what I love without the hassle of having to type in my birthday and gets tons of viruses from all the ads surrounding the video. My only complaintis that the DVD doesn\u2019t come with a package of twelve socks just so I have one for each episode.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I think quality anime, I instantly think TNK. After all, School Days has constantly appeared on my best anime of all-time list  and is usually what I compare all other anime to. Thankfully, High School DxD doesn\u2019t need to be compared to anything else because it\u2019s a completely new type of series resplendent with ideas you won\u2019t find in any other anime. And it has boobies, which are clinically proven to enhance an anime\u2019s rating.\\n\\n\r\nYou may be asking what this nirvana of anime is about. It centers around this perverted guy named Tomoki\u2026er, Issei, sorry. He likes to think about naked girls. I can relate to that because I do that sometimes too. He also has perverted friends who he watches porn with. I can relate to that because Friday Circle Jerks are the best nights of the week. Mostly because of the pizza. The porn\u2019s never that great.\\n\\n\r\nSo anyway, he has some super-duper power that only the most average of people always has and so some sexy fallen angels are after him. And some sexy demon ladies want him too. The demon ladies are much nicer than the fallen angels. In fact, it\u2019s been shown that the Bible doesn\u2019t give Satan enough credit for having nice demons. And the Bible doesn\u2019t even mention how big their titties are. The demon lady, Rias, saves Issei and takes him into her house where he becomes her pawn in some convoluted mess of barely explained but easy to understand stupidity. Now Issei has to learn to be a demon while facing the demons of his obsession with pornography and thinking of girls as nothing more than boobs on two legs.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to do that in a world of perpetual cold though. It seems like those girls need to wear more sweaters. I was at the edge of my seat everytime anyone got a face full of boob, hoping that their eyes weren\u2019t poked out by the diamond-hard nips standing on every girls mounds of glorious jiggliness. On top of that, bras must not be part of the school dress code. This is an understandable move, as the principal must understand how uncomfortable it is to wear a bra. And how comfortable it is to see girls without bras.\\n\\n\r\nEven more of a problem is how badly made the clothes of every female character are. With just a single punch, the girls clothes tear into pieces, exposing things that are not for my virgin eyes. Last time I punched my sister, she didn\u2019t go flying into the air, her clothes raining down around her while I basked in her nudity\u2026\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I\u2019ll get serious now. The plot of High School DxD is not all that compelling. It\u2019s pretty generic stuff. I pretty much saw this as the opposite version of Sora no Otoshimono, where the characters are devils instead of angels, and the tits are much more prevalent. I didn\u2019t mind this though as the plot did move at a decent clip and I guess it wasn\u2019t the worst I\u2019ve seen.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s more character driven than anything, though none of the characters are standouts. Issei is the same tired character we\u2019ve come to find in a lot of this type of anime, the strong-headed pervert who\u2019s useless in every regard except he\u2019s got a lot of heart. Rias is somewhat interesting as the leader of the little group. All the other girls are pretty much generic characters we\u2019ve seen a million times before.\\n\\n\r\nBy now this is a pretty tired tale but there are some redeeming factors to this anime that actually exceeded my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nBoobies.\\n\\n\r\nI was actually recommended this anime by a girl at my local anime convention so I figured it just be another Heaven\u2019s Lost Property. Boy was I surprised when I spent the entirety of the first episode staring at tits, and then spent the subsequent eleven staring at more tits. If you haven\u2019t watched this, then know that this show is extremely explicit. It\u2019s borderline hentai. The camera focuses on tits during conversations, every girl\u2019s got nip going on, every other scene has to have the girls without clothes on for some reason or other. It\u2019s not family friendly at all, unless you have a weird fucking family.\\n\\n\r\nI figured I\u2019d hate the constant tits but I really grew not to care anymore after the first few episodes. Once one of the enemies started shooting laser beams from her nipples, boobs just became part of the package, nothing to even write home about. It\u2019s strange that they\u2019re so commonplace and it\u2019s especially strange that this whole series got an English dub. But the dub actually makes the anime for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors were clearly given a ton of leeway. Considering what they were working with, I can see why the dubbers would do that. In Japanese I feel like this anime wouldn\u2019t even be worth watching. But the dub is so uproariously hilarious at time that I couldn\u2019t stop watching. Issei and his two friends are the best part of the anime. Their banter is hilariously overanimated and ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nDxD has some surprisingly good fight scenes scattered about as well. They all end up falling under some sort of convention in the end, but the quality is pretty good for an anime such as this. And these all culminate with a good, albeit easy to foresee, ending.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s something charming about this anime. And I\u2019m not talking about the goddam tits. Despite the average plot and generally lackluster characters, the comedy and action seem to balance everything well. By all accounts and purposes, this isn\u2019t a good anime\u2026\\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s entertaining as hell.\\n\\n\r\nI was never bored. Some moments had me laughing till I cried. The plot heavy ending was compelling enough to keep me watching. Sure, every third shot was a boob or a thigh or panties, but the comedy helped make this unabashedly shameless. There are some anime that are just boobies and panties  for their own sake and then some comedy thrown in. But High School DxD is so shamelessly filthy and perverted that it\u2019s actually somewhat charming.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not for everyone, but it\u2019s definitely up there with the best ecchi/harem anime on the market.",

            "content": "What do you get when you combine the religious mythology of Paradise Lost with the fanservice of ecchi anime?\r\nHigh School DxD.\r\nWait -- da fuq? How can a masterpiece like Paradise Lost (praise John Milton) be spoken in the same breath as Issei\u2019s Fan Club and Friends? What the hell (pun intended) are you implying? Can an ecchi anime that features nude pics of its main characters midway through each episode even be good?\r\nWell. As flagrant as its shots of boobs, panties, butts, and what have you may be, for an ecchi it is surprisingly good. In fact, if the purpose of ecchi is precisely toappeal to the target audience that would even watch this kind of stuff, then DxD is superb, for the ecchi direction caters exactly to that. We get generous, copious, amounts of NSFW images with that soft, lustrous tint you see surrounding girls\u2019 nipples and defining girls\u2019 lips. Issei blushes profusely and often, the lucky bastard, and even wakes up to several naked girls all vying for his attention. What\u2019s more, the very impetus behind Issei\u2019s powerups that in most shounen would be nakama power is, yes indeed, lust. Not to discount the nakama power that does exist, very strong actually, but the fear of seeing Rias\u2019s boobs halved in size being enough to spur him on? Brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, DxD has plot, and by plot I don\u2019t mean \u201cplot\u201d but actual plot, the series of events providing a vehicle for character change, world exploration, etc. I\u2019m reading Paradise Lost for my Milton class this semester and I\u2019m legitimately getting the same vibes with DxD -- that indescribable feeling of awe in the face of untouchable, higher beings. The conflict of DxD over its three seasons concerns three primary groups, namely the divisions of God\u2019s angels after the war in Heaven into the devils, fallen angels, and loyal angels. In the present day, much much after that war, these big names still exist and when they interact with the human (-ish) main characters\u2026 it\u2019s crazy. Not to mention the notable voice actors chosen for certain roles which only accentuates the coolness. I mean like there\u2019s this one scene where the leaders of each group are sitting at a table, so much power gathered in one place. Hell yeah.\\n\\n\r\nThe aforementioned nakama power arises vis-\u00e0-vis the Occult Research Club. Rias treats her chess pieces as family, and as the story progresses we get solid development and backstory for each one. The tantalizingly unconsummated romance between Issei and Rias always hangs in the background (poor Rias) with Issei continuing to call her President akin to Godai\u2019s calling Kyoko Manager in Maison Ikkoku. As the Club tackles each battle, the members grow closer, and by the third season (BorN) it is genuinely precious to behold. As for Issei\u2019s harem (who to choose?), well, his dream of becoming the Harem King is essentially realized. But more than being an all lovey-dovey harem, DxD highlights the strong bonds between Issei and his fellow club members; their anguish at seeing a nakama in danger and pain is very akin to the anguish we see in the Straw Hats for another of their crew.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of music, if you like sweeping orchestrals and frolicking simple tunes, then you\u2019re bound to enjoy the OST of DxD. Its sonorous qualities match the grand scale of the events, the seriously celestial force of individuals clashing, the power to emanate from an outstretched hand. If only the fights were better animated, but then again we can\u2019t expect anything comparable to ufotable\u2019s work in Unlimited Blade Works.\\n\\n\r\nThe OPs and EDs? The OPs present their corresponding arc events/characters as necessary, and the EDs are as mediocre as can be for an ecchi (as many nude shots as possible). I didn\u2019t really care for the ED music but the OPs I really liked, definitely more serious than what I\u2019d expect from an ecchi (frilly high-pitched female vocals).\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this best on Crunchyroll (good animation). When I tried it on other sites (much worse animation) it was hard to watch. The only thing worse than plenteous oppai is badly visualized plenteous oppai. The fights were, as I noted, just OK, but seeing Issei boost and change his mecha-dragonesque appearance multiple times was pretty slick (plus having the voice of Madao/Hasegawa from Gintama pumping up the MC was quite interesting). Being a fan of fantasy and mythos, seeing the plethora of big names like Azazel and Michael was awesome, and seeing Rias fully bare in the flesh -- and caressing Issei -- and faintly coloring at the thought of Issei -- and caring for her subordinates so dearly -- and her oppai -- and her tenderly rounded derri\u00e8re -- and her vivid scarlet hair -- and I digress. In terms of the bod, Rias Gremory is my #1 girl, matched only by perhaps Senjougahara Hitagi from the Monogatari universe. Issei you lucky, fortunate man.\\n\\n\r\nCould DxD have not been an ecchi? Hmm. Not really. It would change the story drastically because the ecchi and plot are so intricately intertwined. DxD is good ecchi, and I say \u201cgood\u201d in the sense that the fanservice and sensuous elements are made endemic to the plot and MC\u2019s growth rather than being mere add-ons. Take Highschool of the Dead for example, remove the ecchi and you could have 90+% of the story intact; that\u2019s superfluous ecchi. Heck, any show can be made ecchi simply by having the girls dress more scantily and have plenty of clothes being ripped apart, etc. And to taint the arduous fervor of DxD by removing ecchi from its name would be a blasphemy. By the gods and demons and dragons above and below, I need more oppai, more Rias, and hopefully a suitably tender moment between her and Issei to round out the show. I look forward to High School DxD Hero.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 69\\n\r\nReview written for seasons 1-3 (DxD, New, BorN).",

            "content": "So... after a well deserved break from school and responsibilities, this anime has given me a wonderful afternoon with friends.\r\nIs this anime good? No....\r\nDid I have a good time watching this? By all means yes!\r\nHere's why!\r\nStarting off with-\r\n[Story] 2/10 - Good flipping lord.... there is a plot, somewhere, hidden behind all of the sex jokes and breasts that happen every other scene. I strongly believe that there is a story in almost every anime... this one... I really don't know. Sure it has a story, but what is it? All I understood was \"oh we are gonna fight these guys cause why not\".  Evenwhen the anime did try to explain the plot they did it in one scene that seemed to go by really fast, in fact too fast. The story is most prominent when they take it slow and span the explanation of it over a few episodes, giving the viewer that \"Oh so that's whats going on!\" moment. This anime does that once... ONCE! And during the last episode!\\n\\n\r\n[Art] 7/10 - My motto is to give credit where credit is due. The art is good, is it great? No. But its not horrible, which is really nice. While most of the art department went into the characters and not really the backgrounds or scenes that said characters are in, it is still well done. Never making me hate looking at the characters. The only thing that is really bad about the animation/design is the characters hair. Rias' Hair looks horrible... The animation during the ED of the show is also atrocious. That's it!\\n\\n\r\n[Sound] 8/10 - While I did not particularly like the OP of the show it did fit well with it. The ED is great and does seem to fit well with the show as well, I have almost no problem with the songs in this anime. BUT. Some scenes could have used a better song choice, the overall sfx of the show is good, there are some scenes that are a bit iffy but I can give it a pass for now.\\n\\n\r\n[Character] 3/10 - They tried, so hard to create unique and interesting characters but it just doesn't work out. There is one character who is posted as a main character but truly acts as the supporting role in most scenes. What was her name again? Asia? Something like that. The blonde nun. Anyway she is the most flat, uninteresting character I have ever seen. Same goes for Koneko, who also has no character, like ffs when Koneko from Nyan~ Neko Sugar Girls has more of a personality than the one from a real anime there is a problem.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment] 9/10 - It was a late night, me and a few friends had an idea. To watch this anime... and golly it was a great night. This anime is so comically exploitable I cant even describe to you how easy it is! We had a mf blast watching this! The best way I can describe watching this is simple: It's like watching a train wreck, its so bad but you just can't look away!\\n\\n\r\n[Overall] 3/10 - Sound and Art cannot carry a show in my opinion, you need a good balance of everything to even garner a good score. I hate yet love this anime, im a straight man, but seeing so many breasts, and having them show up every other scene got tiring, it was shocking and funny at first. Now its old and used up. So tiring that it makes me want to swing the other way.\\n\r\nDo I recommend this? Nope, especially if you are looking for a plot heavy show. Yes, if you are looking for a trashy anime to watch with tired/drunk friends late at night.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for finishing my review!\\n\r\nIf today is your birthday, Happy Birthday!\\n\r\nHave a wonderful rest of your day, everyone!",

            "content": "So recently I've been told my reviews are biased and unfair, so I'm going to try to write this with the least bias and unfairness I have. Highschool DxD is a special show. It's a show constantly praised for it's ability to, how the fans call it, \"mixing 'plot' and 'plot.'\" Which is basically saying that this show didn't do what every other ecchi show did with shoehorning plot into ecchi, but instead shoehorned ecchi into plot. It's not like this doesn't work, in fact it works very well. The plot is strange at first, but the viewer will quickly get used to it. Myproblem is with the ecchi. It just feels like what I said just before. It's justt shoehorned in ecchi. This show will throw around ecchi like no tomorrow. In one scene, you'll see Rias undressing for the shower, then you'll see someone undressing to seduce Issei, then it's back to Rias coming out of the shower naked. But then there's an intense battle, but the clothing is from Senran Kagura, and it tears off like tissue paper. (I actually really like Senran Kagura for obvious reasons) So the battle is no longer a tense battle with real dangers, but I just see a battle with some tits flying around. Riveting. Some people might argue that if the ecchi is good, then it shouldn't matter. Right? Well, the ecchi is pretty meh. It's not that it's bad, and I'm sure it got better as the show gained more popularity and pumped out higher quality seasons, but that's not the season I'm here to review. The ecchi is average. It doesn't wow me with it's immense detail, it just is ecchi. I'm not saying it's terrible, it just got stale with every scene featuring at least one tit. This part is going to be biased, so you can skip to the next marked part if you don't want to read it. --- It also doesn't help when the girls all look like toothpicks with balloon tits. It doesn't look too appealing at all. I know people like slim girls with large features, but they actually look like toothpicks with balloon tits. --- (back to regular review) The ecchi isn't the most praised part of this show, unlike most other ecchis. This show does something most ecchi shows don't, and it should be applauded. It was able to write a good plot with the ecchi. The plot works. It functions. It does the unthinkable. It makes the plot good in an ecchi tagged show. I actually enjoyed the plot, I thought it was interesting. Even better, it matched good characters with this plot. They didn't go very far with them, and I can't blame them it's first season, but they were good nonetheless. Then the plot is matched with some decently good music, and I can't help but enjoy even if slightly. That's the end of my praise with this show, thought. Although, it had these good things, it wasn't my cup of tea. I have an even better metaphor for it. It's a cake with shitty icing on it, and the cake flavor isn't my favorite. Like, carrot cake with lemon icing. I'm sure some people taste it was chocolate cake with strawberries on top, but I just don't like it. I don't hate this show, I simply don't like it. But even if I don't like it, I'm not the god of anime by a long shot. If you like ecchi, watch this show immediately. And if you have already, make sure to watch the other seasons. This show has plenty of promise, and I'm sure fans of this type of show would eat this up like a delicious cake. I'll end this with a solid 5, low 6. It's good, but I'm positive it'll get only better from here.",

First off, this is a series with soon to be 4 seasons. This is usually not something found in this genre of ecchi, harem, and romance. This first season follows the adventures of Issei and his friends as he learns the ways of demos/devils. Not only is this show packed with some hilarious ecchi fueled moments, but the way the characters are portrayed really bring life and likability to them. While this first season didn\u2019t bring in the back story of every character.It keeps the story good enough to stay on the edge of your seat enthralled by what could happen next. Overall if your looking for a feel good ecchi,harem,romance filled with action, adventures, supernatural beings and a strong story. You need look no further and dive into the world of high school dxd",

With the LN being a simple ecchi fantasy romcom you would expect TNK Studios to actually follow the chain of events and make a good first impression with what was obviously intended as a one-shot thing.\r\nInstead they added a extra genre and basically ripped off Hellsing during the Fallen Angel Arc, with a smarter but more confusing MC and a revenge subplot straight from Brandon Lee's The Crow ( which was a waay better adaption and general movie than this overall). While it might not be noticeable amidthe perversion and lewd moments (of which this thing posses in spades) Issei's constantly changing character is a mystery to watchers of real hardcore anime like Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion and Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.\\n\\n\r\nIs he just a simple pervert with a good brain that he's too lazy to put to full use and a heart of gold behind all that uncouthness and horniness, or is there something more to him that only the writers of the screenplay know of, and constantly refer to even in the \"lewd' moments? Nobody knows, not even the \"ORC\" that he belongs to (which is led by the daughter of one of the most powerful magical families yet. Calling them \"d..ls\" makes no sense at all as they have no real connection to the real things.)\\n\\n\r\nLet's just hope that the other 9 episodes are better.",

            "content": "(Takes a deep breath) Now I'm not one to hate the echhi genre, actually I happen to rather enjoy it. But there is a time and a place for it and it has to have reason. As well as (in my opinion) a good plot, set of likable characters, and some cohesion for the narrative. In my opinion (which is just my 2 cents) this show has none of it. Before I start to tear apart this anime let me give you the mandatory spoiler alert. Let me say that in the first episode the main character dies. And it had ZERO effect, now Idon't know if the creators know this but your supposed to feel bad when you MAIN CHARACTER dies, but alas I was actually happy that he died. Sadly the douche bag pervert main character who has ZERO redeeming traits gets revived by a busty redhead (how is the sister of the current satin (my thoughts on that latter)) and he then \"serves\" her. Aka  tries his damnedest to separate her and her panties. Then we get introduced to the rest of the harem. Aka  anime tropes central. Seriously it's like they copied the damn textbook on anime harem tropes and did nothing new for them. Now we get to some of the worst timed fan-service in all of anime. Not one frame is without something that is exploiting the fan-service label, not one pantte shot unseen not one breast unbounced. And then there's the paper thin plot. *slams head on desk* OHHHHH BOYYYYY THE PLOT! So supposedly  this takes place after the demons are thrown out of heaven and into hell and supposedly the original Satan is killed and is replaced with the head of the house of gremory. (This is by the way is suppose  to take place with the Bible story.) And the redhead is supposed to be married to some dickhead because why the hell not. Some more bullshit happens and with the power of friendship Issie wins a convoluted fight and flys off into the moonlight with Rias (who picked that name?) Final Thoughts: as with most echhi-harem anime don't expect much if you watch this. It's just a bunch of fapping material that doesn't have the decency to be porn, with paper-thin characters to match the plot, crappy music and the only thing that was good was the catchy first ending song. If you don't want to fap or waste your time, give this show a pass. *realizes there's 2 more seasons* GOD DAMN IT!!!!!",

            "content": "Review on English Dub: The High School DxD Franchise is a combination of comedy, harem, ecchi, and romance. DxD is by far one of the highest-rated harem television shows out there, and here is why. Compared to other harem/ecchi shows, High School DxD knows how to deliver a solid plot line as well as execute it. For an ecchi, DxD shows better character development than other popular shows. \r\nStarting on the protagonist, (by far my favorite) Issei Hyoudou has a lot he brings to the table. If you are a fan of crude humor and sexual jokes, you are going to love this. The mainquality that makes him an enjoyable character is his pervertedness. Issei has NO mental filter that keeps him from saying embarrassing things. This is a large part of the comedy in High School DxD. Scott Freeman does an excellent job portraying Issei Hyoudou. DxD got the nomination for the best male and female voice performance, with Scott Freeman playing Issei and Jamie Marchi as Rias Grimory. The show received the BTVA Anime Dub Television/OVA Voice Acting Award in 2015. Along with being a complete pervert, Issei is also reliable. This is his heroic trait that allows him to save the day and appeal to the ladies (despite his unpopularity). \\n\\n\r\nThe story continues to keep the flow with new and exciting elements as well as hilarious comedy. The process of the protagonist going from a loser to a hero is comedic as well as exciting. There are little to no let downs in the story (depending on how you look at it). Even non-ecchi fans can love this show. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is one of the best a harem show can deliver and due to its overwhelming popularity, there is speculation for a 4th season. \\n\\n\r\nEven if you aren't a fan of the ecchi genre, I recommend giving the story and comedy a shot before disregarding it all together.",

So when I was really swamped with collage work, and needed something to unwind to, I decided to give it a try, but never did I expect it to be as great as it turned out to be.\r\nIn thebeginning we are introduced to Issei, who is your average perverted high school boy, on his quest to get ahold of some scrumptious breasts. He one day gets asked out on a date by this gorgeous girl, but when the date ends, she turns into a monster (well actually a fallen angel as we later find out) and kills our poor Issei. Thankfully the horny teenager he is he thinks of a super hot girl, Rias Gremory, he had seen at school, who happens to be a demon, and accidentally summons her to save himself. She saves him, but in exchange for his life he gets turned into a demon and becomes a part of her demon group, that operates in his school under the Occult Research Club.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing about the story is that, while it won't win any awards for originality, it is just executed so well. At no time did I have a bad feeling watching it, as I sometimes have when watching similar anime, as it was never offensively stupid. The point is that while there is a lot of nudity in the show, it is surely not the only thing it has going for it, as the story progresses in such a way that it constantly makes you want to know what is going to happen next, and doesn't just make you crave for more nudity. It manages to be serious at times but overall it just exudes positive energy and makes for a great anime to unwind to, while still offering something a bit more substantial. Quite surprisingly the anime manages to keep a steady pace, and there were no especially weak episodes. The ending was well done and fulfilling, while still being a nice starting point for a second season.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the stronger points of this anime are its characters. Our main character Issei is at first presented just like your average sex-obsessed teenager, but he reveals another side of him, one that is extremely caring and loyal. I have to say I can understand why the girls come to like him, even though the first impressions he makes are generally negative. One thing I can't understand about him is the way he responds to this affection girls show him, as he is always thinking how to get nearer some of the girls, but when he actually gets the chance, he does nothing.\\n\r\nOur female lead is Rias Gremory who is Issei\u2019s master. She comes from a very distinguished demon dynasty and was always looking for someone who would like her for what she was, and not for her family connections. She finds that person in Issei, as he is completely new to the world of demons and is completely loyal to her, because she saved his life. We can see she cares a lot about the rest of the group and constantly tries to make them as satisfied as possible. \\n\r\nLater on we are introduced to another important character in form of Asia, an exiled nun with the power of healing both humans and demons. She is in some serious trouble but Issei helps her get through, and so she joins the group. She shows extreme gratitude towards Issei as he saved her and is also in love with him. I found this relationship between them a bit strange, as Issei sees her as someone he needs to protect, but he is not romantically interested in her (yes, he fantasises about having her, is there a female in the show he fantasise about), while she is completely in love with him. She is also timid enough to do nothing serious about his relationship with Rias, but rather suffers quietly and thinks of herself as a martyr.\\n\r\nWe also have a whole slew of secondary characters, and they are mostly great if a bit unexplored, but hey what can you do in twelve episodes. There are two character I particularly disliked, and they were his two friends, as they are there only to complain about their lack of action. The problem is characters like these are common in the genre, and I have to wonder why. Maybe they are there only to emphasise how lucky the main character is, but I see no reason for the need to emphasise that. The other possibility I could think of is to mock a part of the audience, as they are the kind of people that would watch a show like this, and if that is so, it is funny in a way, but it would be just offensive to the people watching the show as, I still want to believe not many people like those two exist. Well enough of my ranting, as these two are practically the only two characters that I disliked, even though the villains could have been done a bit better, but they still get the job done.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is done exceptionally, everything is smooth, the backgrounds are detailed, and the colours really pop. One thing I have to touch about the animation is the fan-service that really is plentiful. This thing has to have the most nudity I have seen in an anime, but unlike some other anime I have watched, everything is still in good taste (I\u2019m looking at you Yosuga no Sora), but you should still skip this if you dislike fan-service. The sound was nothing special but the opening was still pretty awesome and while the ending was nowhere near as good it wasn't offensive in any way. The voice acting was great, but I still cannot comprehend why are they choosing such character names that the voice actors are unable to pronounce correctly. \\n\\n\r\nI knew High School DxD was supposed to be good, but I could have never believed, that it was going to as good as it was. The point is that in my opinion fan-service in itself is perfectly fine, but if that is all an anime has going for it, it is going to be a pain to watch. As I had said in the intro you might start watching this for the \u201cplot\u201d, but the story is the thing that is going to get you hooked. All in all it deserves to get a score of 9 out of 10, as while it was great, there are still many places where improvement is possible, who knows maybe if some of them are alleviated in the next season it might even get a perfect score. I do recommend this to everyone who can stand a bit of fan-service, it could even be a good starting anime for some.\\n\r\nI really do appreciate feedback, as I want to improve my writing, and seeing people actually read my reviews gives me the push to write new reviews.",

            "content": "What? An extremely ecchi-based series that actually has a decent plot line? Unheard of...\r\nHigh School DxD (I guess Demon x Demon?) is like a cross between the fights of Ikkitousen and the setting in Kore wa Zombie Desuka. An extremely perverted, girlfriend-less dude named Issei suddenly gets a girlfriend and then promptly dies soon afterwards. He is then reborn as a Demon and serves under high-class demon Rias Gremory.\r\nThe first line in the series after the initial intro are along the lines of \"ah.. I wanna squeeze some boobs.\" You pretty much know exactly what you're getting into at that point. However, despite the veryhigh level of ecchi (and surprisingly few god rays), this series actually manages to tell a relatively interesting story; though of course you have to be able to tolerate the amount of ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an above average series for the ecchi-based school-based genre that has decent action and your typical ecchi comedy. Do not watch if you cannot tolerate topless nudity.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nDxD is pretty good looking overall. The series overall has a slightly unsaturated look despite using some pretty strong reds and blue/purples. The series is not as crisp as it could be in some of the action sequences but I didn't notice it too much as the shiny bright attacks/effects obviously distract from the minor details.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter styling is nice as well. You have a good mix of distinguishable primary characters, as well as a lot of plain yet differentiated background characters. I'm somewhat surprised at the level of non-censorship that AT-X gets away, I sure don't remember a high school club where all the girls occasionally go topless...\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't gotten the message yet, this is an extremely perverse series, to a similar degree (though in a different way) as Sora no Otoshimono. There are multiple, highly suggestive scenes. This is not quite balanced out by occasional action, most of which involves Issei getting almost killed (again) before being saved by the other demons. As in Kore wa Zombie Desuka, the main male character has unusual regenerative abilities and the series takes advantage of this to bloody things up.\\n\\n\r\nAssuming you can deal with the blood/boobs, this series is fairly good looking.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP is reminiscent of other girl-based fighting shows and the ED somehow reminds me of Infinite Stratos, both aren't anything remarkable but suitable for the series. The BGM is appropriate, I liked the stringed instrument parts, but is overall forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nThe VA cast is composed of surprisingly many veterans. Almost all the main and relevant supporting cast have very strong voice actors. Asia's VA is comparatively new but does a really good job in bringing out her personality.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nSo Issei apparently possesses a \"Sacred Gear\", some sort of magical weapon that is inside him (think Makens from Maken Ki). These Sacred Gear are important in the three-way war/battle between angels, fallen angels, and demons; and Issei is killed to prevent him from being a threat to any of the groups. Luckily for Issei, he is picked up by a high-class demon named Rias and suddenly is given a second chance at getting his Harem. Unfortunately he starts out as a weak, low-class demon and must train to become stronger.\\n\\n\r\nThe story can be divided into two main arcs that both have a good mix of rising action/climax/falling action. The first deals with Issei's induction as a demon and a fight with fallen angels. The second arc deals with Rias and her fiance demon. In general, both arcs are both interesting despite a fairly predictable progression.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't a perfect work. Certain episodes felt like filler material, and the everyone-gets-sacrificed grand finale is way overused. There are also lots of elements that aren't totally explained (or are over-explained given their relative unimportance) but the series does set it self up for a season two and perhaps elements will be clearer then.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nIf you take a look at the cast tab, you'll quickly deduce that this is a character-spamming series. There are at least two dozen characters that appear, take on a really minor role, and then quickly disappear never to be seen again. In general, I frown upon such a practice, but in this case the series successfully develops the main characters despite the extra baggage.\\n\\n\r\nIssei is your typical hopelessly-ecchi guys who also happens to be nice and has an indomitable willpower (not too different from Zombie Desuka). He happens to then join a family of demons that apparently takes on the \"Occult Club\" role in the school. You have a good mix of character personalities ranging from cute moe/shy to ultra-sadistic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter relations are surprisingly well done considering the ecchi focus of the series. Many of the characters here are dynamic and change noticeably due to interactions with each other. Issei's relationships are probably best summed up as \"it's complicated.\"\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThe value of this series will greatly depend on your tolerance for ecchi. The story and character elements are fairly good for this genre and I found the overall progression enjoyable.",

The story was okay and everything you expect to see happen in the next episodes mostly comes true so it doesn't fail to disappoint. I really want to leave out the super echiiness of this anime but it's just too overwhelming. But I got to admit, it was pretty sexy at times X3.\r\nNOW! Finishing off what I was saying about the plot, it was very simple and straightto the point. There's an average high school student who gets mixed into drama, action, and a whole bunch of echii moments that deal with demons, exorcists, and fallen angels. The characters were good, the scenes were fun to watch, and in the end, a well made anime but not something I would want to watch over again. Still, it is one good season to watch for those who want to take a break from all the serious animes. \\n\\n",

Just, great. \r\nHighschool DxD, a famous ecchi/harem anime really made me gasp and invested me in all the conflicts and humour they threw in my face through all the 12 episodes of the show.\r\nWhat this anime succeeded in doing, but many other ecchi anime failed in doing is delivering actual plot (not that kind of plot you pervs) and emotions. \r\nStory: Outstanding. Main character, Issei, gets killed and turns into a demon, this being a start of his new life as a part of house/clan (I don't really know what to call it) Gremory. There are many demon anime out there, but this onefeels a little special in all the ways it goes deep into the lore and nature of demons, while keeping it's lighthearted and ecchi tone in the process. Great!\\n\\n\r\nArt: Awesome. That's all.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Very good. I loooove both the opening and ending themes and think the singer has a beautiful voice. I prefer the op tho, it's just so awesome and badass.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Issei is awesome. He may seem like a standard perv protagonist (which he is), but through the series it shows that his personality is far more then that. All other characters are in the same way, and special in their own ways, making them all really enjoyable to watch. They can be assholes something tho, and their perviness can be a little over-the-top, but that's just a minor nitpick.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: GREAT! From art, sound to enjoyable and downright adorable characters, this series made something that would seem boring and cliche into a very special and magical anime. I'll definitely read the light novel next!",

            "content": "Despite this being H heavy, it was an enjoyable anime to watch.  Hopefully I'll have as much fun when I write this.  (Spoilers included)\r\nThe comedic elements are different from your normal anime, the characters are a bit cliche but they managed to pull it off.  Fair play to them.  The plot is similar to a manga I'm currently reading(well the idea anyway) but it's simple, yet effective.  The nude scenes are relatively well drawn (I'm not a perv.  I guarantee.)  But what stands out the most to me are the characters' logic.\r\nIssiei's Logic : That B*$tered made senpaicry, I MUST KILL HIM!!!\\n\\n\r\nRias' Logic : To not marry the man of NOT my dreams, I'll sleep with one of my club members. (Yes because ALL good ideas start with sleeping with other people)  With my disadvantaged chess team, I'll take part in a ludicrous rating game against a full set just so I don't have to marry him.  That's IF I win of course. \\n\\n\r\nKoneko's Logic : There are 3 perverts inside a locker, I think I'll punch the locker door to scare them.\\n\\n\r\nAshia's Logic : My only friend is a boy and I REALLY like him, so I'll do nothing to get his attention except wear clothes for him to strip off of me.  Also, I was part of the church but now, I'm a demon, so I'll pray and repent when I do sinful things.  (Despite these, she is the only one that's kind of normal)\\n\\n\r\nKiba's Logic:  There's a hot knight in the opposing team.  I'll fight her because I love my sword.  \\n\\n\r\nAkeno's Logic: Well, she's a sadist so no need to explain.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there are memorable action moments to pointless romantic scenes, this is a pretty good show.  I love the relationships among the club members and how the plots makes so little sense.  It's a good show to watch for mindless (I mean like no need to analyse)comedy, for inspiration how wild one can go in writing a story.  \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing about this show is that it comes with a catch, Heavy H.  I'm not that into it (WOW, a guy that doesn't like H.  Is he even straight? (Yes I am)).  There's so many pointless H scenes with spoiled the greatness of this show.  Is Rias's oversized breast REALLY important in the show?  Is the fact that Ashia is not happy with her normal sized ones relevant?  Do we really need to see that Issei is a pervert and thinks about really lewd girl on girl porn when he sees Akeno stretchs with Ashia?  \\n\\n\r\nThe other thing is the religion involved.  I'm not too content with the whole idea of God vs Bad angels vs Demons.  It's not right.  I'm very sensitive with religion so that made me dislike this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, ignoring the H and the religion, it's a pretty emotional show of a guy, taking care of all his women.  (The occult research club is a pretty interesting name for a club)\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this (Not so well written) review.",

If your a female then I wouldn't recommend watching this beautiful piece of art (unless your in to ecchi stuff) .If your a male wanting to get hard, give this anime a try, if you are disappointed then you are no man, go to the doctor to make sure something isn't unscrewed from your brain cause this piece of art is beautiful, seriously this anime should gointo the world record book for being too god damn amazing",

            "content": "High School DxD is an ecchi anime with an actual intriguing plot. Even though this show has a ton of fan service and nudity it still has a story that will have people invested in this show.\r\nStory- The story is about Issei Hyoudou a perverted 17 year old who is reincarnated as a devil by Rias Gremory who is the president of the Occult Research Club (ORC). Issei finds out later that he has a rare sacred gear called Boosted Gear that can boost power past god and satan. From there they, The ORC, get into battles with the other devil families which are theHouse of Sitri and the House of Phoenix. The second half of this season of High School DxD is about an arranged marriage between Rias and Riser Phoenix that she doesn't want to happen so they have a rating game to decide her fate.\\n\\n\r\nSound- High School DxD has really good voice acting in both the sub and dub. The music on the other hand is between good and really good.\\n\\n\r\nArt- The animation for High School DxD is great for an ecchi anime. Even the action scenes are pretty epic with High School DxD's animation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- All the characters have great personalties. Issei is a pervert, but he is a likable characters because even though he thinks about the girls naked he does act nice to them and shows them respect most of the time. Although his antics can get annoying from time to time. Rias Gremory is the Issei's main love interest and the next heir to the House of Gremory and President of the ORC who is kind to mostly everyone she meets. Akeno who is a gentle girl who just happens to be into S&M. Asia who use to be a nun for the church. Kiba who is a loyal guy that a majority of the girls at Kuoh Academy have a crush on him. Finally there's Koneko who has a cold personality and despises Issei's perverted nature, however considers him a hard worker.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I didn't expect for a show like High School DxD to be this entertaining with an actual story that the \"plot\" isn't what makes this show enjoyable even though there is a ton of fan service. It has really good action scenes, it shows how devils interact with angels and fallen angels, and shows what devils actually do. This is an anime that is definitely worth watching.",

            "content": "I\u2019m doing this review like a person who doesn\u2019t consider himself a big fan of the echi. I think echi can be a plus when is correctly used, but, to be honest, this doesn\u2019t happen much. There are so many animes which develops an excesive fanservice, puting the story and the characters in a secundary place with a poor and barely convincing development, and leaving behind a cuestionable legacy of breasts + erotics and pointless scenes that can get you a boner, but not much more.\r\nI think this isn't the case of High School DXD. Yes, the serie has a lot of echi with nakedgirls and erotic scenes everywere, but this anime actually has a decent (not great, but decent) plot. The characters are actually deep and complex. Even if the first impression shows us another idiotic mc with a strong breasts obsession, we can see other sides of him as the story progresses, and this also applies to the other characters, each one with their own dark past and fears. The romantic development is also a plus, since most echi-harem animes don't make a good job in this topic.\\n\r\nAlso, the serie settles in a well-constructed and politically complex world with an interesting history, rules and factions that makes us get interested in the story and, at least in my case, enjoy it.\\n\r\nBy last, I think the soundtrack is also a plus for the series, since the music really gets to the point and influences the ambient in the right moments.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: If you are looking for a good and entertained shonen-echi anime, you should probably enjoy High School DXD.\\n",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nUsually whenever I watch a Harem it's mostly the same thing, but there are few that I consider gems because they don't just focus on the fanservice and this is definitely one of them.\r\nThe story begins with Issei Hyoudou a regular teenage pervert desperately looking for a girlfriend then suddenly his wish is answered, but it was a trap as the girl he liked was actually a fallen angel and attempted to kill him, however Issei was saved by the Devil known as Ria's Gremory and from this point Issei's life would forever change for the better.\r\nNow surprisingly for a Harem anime itactually has a pretty interesting story as it concentrates on the world of Devils and Angels along with the addition of a third party called Fallen Angels, getting to know each of their societies and history was actually very interesting to learn, during this season it mainly focuses on the Devils and the different houses they have along with the different roles that the members have whose powers are very similar to the pieces on a chess board.\\n\r\nThe first season focuses on two arcs the first is about Issei and Asia's introduction to the Occult Research Club and pretty much what the rules are and the jobs they have to do since they are servants of Ria's, but it also focuses on the Fallen Angels who attacked Issei and wish to use the powers Asia has since they are very rare.\\n\r\nThe second half focuses more on Ria's and her forced marriage to Riser Phoenix, the battle between the two houses shows how well Issei and the others worked together as there is some strategy involved in the fights that do happen in the series, it also shows how determined Issei is to protect Ria's and the other's in the club.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters were great out of all the harem anime's I've seen this definitely has the best mix of characters.\\n\r\nIssei is the male MC and is a really perverted guy, but despite his perverseness he actually does care for his other teammates and is willing to die to protect them no matter what the situation is, he also gains the powers of the Scared Gear known as Boosted Gear which actually has the Red Dragon Emperor known as Ddraig who helps Issei learn the powers of the Boosted Gear.\\n\r\nRia's Gremory is the female MC and the leader of the Occult Research Club, even though she has an amazing figure she definitely shouldn't be underestimated because Ria's is certainly a badass and will use her powers to protect her servants, she is actually a very kind person and always wants to make sure her servants are safe from harm, she is also a good leader too as she always plans out a strategy whenever her team enters a battle with another Devil House.\\n\r\nAsia Argento is actually a nun of the catholic church that Issei befriends until she is captured by the Fallen Angels who wanted her rare ability called Twilight Healing that is until Issei and the others came to help her and after that she joined Ria's House as one of her servants. Asia is a shy, innocent and is fairly inexperienced at socialising which makes such an adorable character and her interactions with Issei and the other club member really helps prove this.\\n\r\nAkeno Himejima is Ria's Queen and is pretty much the most powerful member alongside Ria's, she is a very flamboyant character always teasing Issei (and us the audience) with her figure, but that doesn't mean she can be serious because if you get in her way you probably won't survive.\\n\r\nKoneko Toujou is the loli and Tsundere of the group she is also Ria's Rook and despite being small she has incredible strength as she is able to throw objects easily and has a powerful punch which she uses on Issei a couple of times because of his pervy nature.\\n\r\nYuuto Kiba the other male character of the group is Ria's Knight and is considered the best looking guy in Kuou Academy by the ladies which makes Issei jealous of him until he knows he is working for Ria's, since they are the only male characters they get on very well and Kiba has a strong heart towards the protection of his friends.\\n\r\nNow High School DxD isn't known for having strong villains, but they get the job done. Raynare is the main villain for the first half of the series and is a Fallen Angel, despite her revealing outfit she is actually pretty powerful that is until Issei kicks her ass, Riser is the main villain for the second half of the series and is a very cruel person not caring much for his servants other than sexual desires and his overconfidence of his powers eventually led to his downfall, then finally there is the guy known as Freed Sellzen who is an Exiled Exorcist he's that type of villain you hate and like at the same time because his overzealous personality really made for some funny yet aggravating moments.\\n\\n\r\nNow the artstyle was pretty good as the powers each member of Gremory team has were pretty damn cool especially Issei's Boosted Gear which does change from a metallic glove to a full bodied suit which was epic to look at, the uniforms were actually pretty slick and the characters looked well designed too especially the female characters, the intro and outro were actually surprisingly catchy and just didn't seem like something you would skip.\\n\\n\r\nNow the fanservice is what we all came for and it is pretty consistent, but it doesn't take me out of the show like other Ecchi anime's, all the female characters had well made figures yes even Asia and Koneko and it really did make for some funny comedic moments which included the greatest power of all time which is the dress break power that Issei eventually learns which means he could break girls clothes just by touching them and this is certainly a power all men want.\\n\\n\r\nThe action compared to other Harem anime's wasn't just mindless punching and throwing yourselves at the enemy there was actually some strategy to it like when Ria's house was up against Riser's house, before they started fighting Ria's made sure to send her best people to the right areas and this felt really satisfying that they were coming up with plans and not just blindly running into the fire.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a fantastic show, if you're into Ecchi/Harems then you need to check this one out and it won't disappoint you because trust me I've had quite a taste of Harem anime's and none have surpassed this one.",

I've heard people praise it for it's use of mythology, how the ecchi is smart. Shut the fuck up, this anime is equally as trash as Eromanga-sensei. There is nothing smart about this show. It has a mediocre plot and a shit ton of ecchi to turn off any regular watcher.\r\nAnd I'm enjoying it so much.\r\nHigh School DxD is not something everyone will enjoy. For crying out loud, it contains the Four Apocalypse of Anime (Harem,Ecchi, School, Demons). The SFX are way louder than the voice acting, and it annoys the crap out of me. The art and animation is mediocre for 2012 standards. The characters are crap. The story is actually barely above average.\\n\\n\r\nBUT I'M ENJOYING THE FUCK OUT OF IT. There's something visceral that I can't describe about High School DxD. It's a strange phenomenon even for me, someone who hates ecchi trash, that I can enjoy High School DxD. I realized that you kind of just have to get into the mood of the show to understand it. I can't describe it.\\n\\n\r\nJust watch it and let yourself note how shitty it is.

Its all about a guy and his relationship(s) with a hot demon girl with massive bonghoygobongos, who he has to protect and serve.  The first episode does its best to set itself far away from the rest of the pace from the anime. The first episode felt closer to the sexual/violence vibe I get from Gantz then straight up fan service. I would say that this is one of the best harem anime if not the best haremanime...if only harem anime was good.",

Personally, I believe DxD is a masterpiece in its' earlier seasons,  I have multiple reasons for this, one of which being that I can relate to the protagonist and his emotions towards his comrades, treating them as his own family as he grows fond of them. Due to the lack of spoilers in my review, I will not share any more about this.\r\nAs a 'Harem' Anime, one will expect a lot of Fan-Service, however, this works in the favour of High-School DxD, with the protagonist being a pervert, one will expectthat with power, he will attempt to do perverted things. This is toned down with the varied environments and characters he encounters, putting his safety at risk so he could protect others.\\n\\n\r\nThis goes into the mentality of Issei Hyoudou, where through being shunned by others due to his perverse nature, being able to be friends with a whole cast of people changes him... not so much as to change his perverseness, it changes how he views the people around him, not as simply friends, but something akin to family.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, I will state that I am bias in my review of this Anime, being a humongous fan of High-School DxD for the wrong reason, where most are drawn by it's blatant use of 'Oppai' I thoroughly enjoy the genuine story and the development of the characters and their arcs, making each individual into a better person for many different reasons.",

To resume, itis an anime to watch an relax, nothing to be thought so much and I feel great about liking it.\\n\\n\r\nTo finish I really hope it gets another season, but I just can hope because there is so many animes \"unfinished\" that a season 2 is probably never gonna happen.",

            "content": "Note: This will be a review of the series in its entirety.\r\nOverview:\r\nHonestly, out of all the many anime genres out there, the ecchi/harem genre is easily the most controversial. Oftentimes, the writers will focus solely on pleasing the audience's perverted desires, while neglecting anything even resembling a decent story. With that in mind, it's easy to see why \"High School DxD\" is commonly seen as one of the prime examples to do the genre right. Make no mistake, \"High School DxD\" is as ecchi as they come, but it doesn't use its fanservice as a crutch to hold up sagging plot and characters.\r\nStory & World(8/10):\\n\r\nThe story follows Issei Hyoudou, a perverted 17-year-old student at Kuoh Academy, a former all-girls school that has recently turned co-ed. Obsessed with breasts and dreaming of having a harem, Issei is unexpectedly asked out on a date, and even more unexpectedly killed at the end of it, with the girl revealing herself to be a Fallen Angel. However, Issei is in luck, as he gets rescued by a Devil named Rias Gremory, who later declares herself to be his master. Yeah, turns out Fallen Angels and Devils are two separate beings in this universe, and Issei has been turned into one of the latter to save his life. He then becomes a member of the Occult Research Club, which is a front for Rias's base of operations. Basically, Issei has to do jobs for humans, compete with other Devils in fighting matches and help Rias and her other servants defend themselves from both Fallen Angels and Angels. And Rias states if he does a good job, he may just have some servants of his own one day. Upon hearing this, Issei resolves to fulfill his dream of having his own harem, and to become the \"Harem King\".\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the story great is that the status of things is constantly changing. In the hands of most other writers, Issei would constantly try to woo women to no avail, fail in any attempt at progression towards his goal and after three or four seasons of searching for his killer, he'd be no closer to finding her than when he started. \"High School DxD\", however, is nothing like that. Enemies are dealt with as soon as possible, with only a select few being given a second chance. The girls falling for Issei is also a gradual process, with it generally not happening until he does something to really earn their love. And while Issei starts off as something of a butt-monkey, by the end of the fourth season, you get the impression things are really starting to go right for him, making it hard to believe he was ever unlucky.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, while the story is certainly fantastic by harem anime standards, it's also not without its problems. What the series sorely lacks in is consistency. We start off with Devils, Angels and Fallen Angels, but it isn't long before we're introduced to characters from every mythology you can think of, which can get pretty overwhelming, to say the least. There are times when I honestly forgot just what the story is about. The problem with consistency is also evident in Sacred Gears, ancient artifacts wielded by several characters including Issei. We see that reading a Bible and simply praying to God causes serious pain to Devils, so shouldn't Sacred Gears, which were bestowed upon them by God, hurt them as well? And later on, we have a Devil wielding a holy sword, which were established earlier to be able to annihilate Devils and that simply touching them is highly toxic for them. This contradiction is never even brought up in the series, so we're basically supposed to accept it at face value without any real explanation given. As far as plot holes go, this is pretty damn inexcusable, though maybe I'm reading too much into it. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation (8/10):\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty good, but not what I'd call fantastic. For the most part, it looks great but there are several moments where rough edges become noticeable. Also worth noting is that the fourth season is done by a different studio from the other three, meaning the art style is given a complete overhaul, which may disappoint some people. There are also times when the fanservice can be too much, such as when a character's breast is clearly visible in what's supposed to be a very sad moment, though thankfully this doesn't happen often.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Dialogue (8.5/10):\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is all over the place- in some scenes it's great, but there are other scenes when it can be very ill-fitting. I actually noticed a couple of times when the exact same track was played for two scenes with completely different tones. There's a different opening for each season, but none of them stood in my mind quite as much as the first, which is used brilliantly in the respective season's final showdown. The voice acting is solid, and I would definitely recommend watching the dub, as it really ups the funny, perverted dialogue, which really fits the silly tone of the series, and Jamie Marchi in particular does a fantastic job as Rias. It should be noted, however, that several voice actors are replaced over the latter two seasons, most notably Issei's and Akeno's, which may take a bit of getting used to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.5/10):\\n\r\nWe'll start with the man himself, Issei. He initially comes off as a lecherous asshole, and is seen as such by nearly his entire school. While he is lecherous, by the end of the first episode, it becomes clear he's not an asshole at all. He's not even a jerk with a heart of gold. He's actually a really nice guy who will go out of his way to ensure a girl enjoys a date as much as possible. There's a reason all the main girls end up falling for him, and that's because he's a protective badass who often goes to hell and back (both literally and metaphorically) for them. He's also very respectful of their feelings, and refuses to take advantage of them in a depressed state, even if they're the ones making the move. This chivalrous nature becomes especially apparent when we see other characters who already have what he has, but are complete assholes because of it and treat the women like their property. That said, while Issei's perverted antics are certainly funny, there are times when they can be just plain ridiculous. During one fight, he goes through all sorts of crazy power-ups in an attempt to keep up with his opponent, but the thing that finally gives him the upper hand is fear of his harem's chests getting smaller (it makes sense in context). There's also the fact that he's ALWAYS the one to fight the main villain of an arc, even when it would make more sense for another character to fight them, making him something of a spotlight-stealer in his own series. Nevertheless, as far as harem protagonists go, Issei ranks among one of the very best, and has very much earned the affection of the girls around him.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, my favourite character would have to be the aforementioned Rias. The other characters are technically her servants, but that's very easy to forget since she really doesn't treat them like her servants at all. She gets them to do errands and commands them in battle, but more often than not she acts more like a surrogate mother or older sister figure. Her affectionate nature towards the others, Issei in particular, is really sweet and had no problem winning me over as early as the first few episodes. She also has an extraordinary lack of shame, and has no problem being naked in front of others (when she wants to be at least), to the point that her reaction to someone walking in on her is simply a polite \"Good morning!\" without even trying to cover herself up. For people who dislike the tsundere always being the lead, Rias is most certainly a breath of fresh air. She can be a tad selfish and possessive when it comes to Issei, despite his desire to have a harem, but it should be noted that Devils are explicitly stated to be selfish beings by nature, and not even really kind ones like Rias are immune, so I had no problem looking past this. Besides, despite her usual mature nature, she is still a teenage girl, so I'd say this kind of behaviour would be normal even if she wasn't a Devil.\\n\\n\r\nNext up, we have Akeno, the vice-president of the club and Rias' best friend and first servant. She comes off as a refined lady most of the time, but in combat she becomes a giggling sadist, often smiling as she electrocutes enemies. She's also a big pervert and just as shameless as Rias, though also much more forward and loves teasing Issei. The series also features a prominent male other than Issei, namely Yuuto Kiba, the Prince of the school and a total badass with a sword, who eventually becomes Issei's best friend (essentially, he is to Issei as Akeno is to Rias). There's also Koneko, a small girl with massive strength and a very sharp tongue, who makes me laugh practically every time she opens her mouth, and Asia, a former nun who joins the club shortly after Issei and has a Sacred Gear that allows her to heal anyone, be they humans, Angels or Devils. She doesn't fight, but she is pretty much the one keeping the group together, and it's often shown just where they would be without her.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are quite a few characters I didn't like. In season three, we're introduced to Rossweisse, a Valkyrie, who doesn't have much personality to speak of. She's cheap, more conservative than the other girls and very pessimistic, all of which serve to make her pretty annoying. Also, in season 3, Loki as a villain. Gee, never seen that before. Additionally, Loki is usually portrayed as a complex anti-villain with sympathetic motives, but this version is just a generic doomsday villain who wants to destroy all of reality because.... reasons. This is, without a doubt, the worst version of Loki I've seen. Hell, the \"Son of the Mask\" character is more fleshed-out than this version. The problem is that the extra mythologies often don't feel necessary since they don't add all that much to the story. The devil and angel characters are who really matter, and thankfully, they're usually great.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.5/10):\\n\r\n\"High School DxD\" is a hugely enjoyable series. The action scenes are plentiful and awesome and there were more than a few moments where I just could not stop laughing, in no small part thanks to Koneko. Sure, sometimes the jokes can get a bit repetitive, but that doesn't happen very often, and the constant shift in status keeps the series from ever getting boring. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n\"High School DxD\" is a fantastic twist on the harem genre. It won't win prizes for consistency and doesn't do anything particularly original, and some may be off-put by the perversions or just find the whole thing pretty juvenile. However, if by chance you're looking for an ecchi/harem anime that combines a healthy amount of fanservice with an actually good story, then this is exactly the one you should watch.\\n\\n\r\nScore:\\n\r\n8+8+8.5+7.5+8.5=40.5/50=8.1/10",

Although not all the characters have Doubles D's to be exact this is an anime full of ass, ass, ass, tits, tits, and tits.\r\nThere is nothing special about this show other than it's ability show as much nudity equivalent to the amount of gore that can be found in Gantz or other Seinen manga or shows. But you have to applaud this show for being good at what it was meant to do. Give themajority male audience a cock tease.\\n\\n\r\nFor story well there is kind of a story...and it's actually a pretty enjoyable one. I never thought I would say that I actually enjoyed the story of an Ecchi anime but somehow this story intrigued me. Along with a pretty badass climax I feel as though you can honestly enjoy this show if you can make it through the cock tease we all know that perverts like me originally come to watch the show for. But I was surprised and I feel like underneath all them asses, and titties is another group of asses, and titties but under that is a fairly enjoyable anime.The comedy is also there giving me a few laughs here and there. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are quite likable as well and the villains do a good job in being dickheads. Obviously because this anime is one huge cock tease...wait what? The romance actually kind of goes somewhere? NICE. But in order to get to that point you have to get past the usual predictable ecchi, harem anime norms of getting caught doing something pervy, or about to get it on then getting stopped, etc. But overall the characters do develop and it's fun to see. As for the likability of these characters they are all pretty likable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a simple anime with voluptuous, jiggly, animated tits, and some very nice animated ass, with a surprisingly enjoyable story and characters where if you can just shut your brain off and just watch you will enjoy quiet a bit.",

The characters are also fantastic, they all have their separate well developed personalities and they all have something to love from them. Also, even though it is a harem anime it never over those it with that like SAO and stuff like that. Here even the harem is well developed. So give ita watch if it interests you!",

Everyone should have that mindset while watching this show...well any show of this caliber. I have read some of the reviews stating that this show is horrible...obviously the people who wrote them had high expectations. Not to denounce their statements, this is just my opinion. Anyways, I really enjoyed the anime. You have your typical main male character and he wants a harem..whats not to like? That short sentence can explain thewhole plot.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nOne word...breasts...now on to the next one.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI did enjoy the orchestra scores used, especially in the more intense parts of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nNow this is where I was a little disappointed with the show. Issei was always very honest with himself. He is a huge perv. He even created a technique soley for ripping the clothes off women...at least it was effective. But other than Isse, Rias, and Asiai, the show didn't reveal much about the rest of the cast. They didn't even mention slightest about the other characters except their rank. I wished they would have gone in a little more detail about how they ended up as devils or were they already devils to begin with? \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nYou get out, what you put in...Highschool DxD was enjoyable for what it was, and if you don't like random panty shots and naked women on your screen than this show is not for you. But for me, I enjoy harem animes. Even though the plots are easily readable, I enjoy them for a good laugh. Also, the grand fight scenarios were a nice touch. But my favorite line from the show...wait that would spoiling...its in the second episode I believe...I find it hilarious.",

Most people have at the least heard this anime name before but I just watched it this week. Full of up skirts being blocked out by a pair of winged D's as well as blurred out shower scenes this is the traditional pervy/hilarious anime with some seriously well thought out action sequences. In a world where demons, fallen angels, and angels are involved in a 3 way war that has stayed a stalemate for years, the devils have lost their numbers so in an attempt to raisethem they start making contracts with humans and turning them into demons. This is where our hero comes in, after he is killed by his \"girlfriend\" who turns out to be a fallen angel he is brought back by a demon and told that he has a sacred gear inside of him and he is now a \"pawn\" of the gremory house. This anime was good and I'll be glad when I get to see the next season because it has a lot of potential because the fallen angel and angel aspects somewhat taper off near the end of the first season so there is a lot more room for exploration so stay tuned on this one.",

            "content": "\"High School DxD\" really surprised me. I went in expecting a by-the-numbers ecchi-harem, and got a whole lot more.\r\nFirst off, it should be worth mentioning that the characters in the show are actually very well-written, with real developments and arcs(!). The main character, while rather annoying and pitiful at first, grows and changes throughout the course of the show, and it's really a delight to see. The supporting characters, too, all have their quirks and are immediately very likeable (Rias Gremory being the absolute standout, if you'd even call her a \"supporting lead\"). Having characters that you care about, obviously, makes a show infinitely moreinvesting, and such is the case here.\\n\\n\r\nThe score was very nice, with a nice range of styles and instrumentation, and although not a masterpiece, it brought its own unique flavour to the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself doesn't really try anything new to the table, although certain aspects of the show are somewhat subversive (which I won't delve into here, for fear of spoilers). But the somewhat formulaic narrative is definitely overshadowed by the great characters, which absolutely steal (and save) the show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're curious about High School DxD, I suggest you at least check out the first batch of episodes, because it really did surprise me, and I'm definitely looking forward to seeing it again.",

            "content": "\"Highschool DxD has too much ecchi/nudity.\" That's one of the reasons I took so long to watch this series... But for some reason, I decided to watch To Love-Ru before this. So, basically, there's not a lot of ecchi in Highschool DxD in comparison. Anyway, that aside, I found this series to be really awesome, and here's why.\r\nStory (8): I don't feel like this story is completely original. Maybe I've seen something similar somewhere before, but that doesn't really matter. It's still a great plot regardless. The way the story progresses around the main characters keeps your attention constantly!\r\nArt (8): The art is very good.The drawings are all nice, and the ecchi is well done as well. I think the show shines when the action scenes are in play!\\n\\n\r\nSound (8): Awesome music, awesome sound effects, characters have cool voices as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9): When the main character of an anime considered \"harem\" is actually really freaking awesome, then the show is guaranteed to be successful. Not only is the main character actually cool and perverted, but all the other main characters have their own unique personalities and abilities. This isn't your typical harem anime after all!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8): There were a lot of times I laughed. I even felt moved at some of the emotional scenes. However, with a lot of build-up leading to certain action scenes, the excitement becomes palpable and I can't help but say \"YES!\" when something awesome happens!\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8): Really good series. So glad I've got several more complete seasons ahead of me to watch!\\n",

            "content": "High-School DXD is like the John Cena of the anime world, some hate it and, some love it. Me, I'm in the grey area, I like certain elements of the show and, hate other elements. \r\nIn a world of angels, fallen angels and devils we follow Issei Hyodo a high school student who may be the most perverted anime character I've seen all my life. He is killed and, is reborn as a demon to serve Rias Gremory  as her pawn. Other servants include Akeno (queen), Kiba (knight), Koneko (rook) and Asia (bishop).\r\nStarting off with the artwork of the show it is phenomenal,character and, location designs are smooth as ice. The action sequences of the show are fantastic particularly in the final three episodes and, this is what the show desperately needed more of. Most of the comedy was pretty hilarious and, musical score was pretty decent. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and, ending songs of the show were completely forgettable, I honestly do not remember a single lyric or frame from either of them. \\n\\n\r\nThe first arc of the show is as generic of a set up as you can get, new guy joins this group and, eventually brings in a new member who is kidnapped and, goes against the orders of the master to save them with the help of other members. The set up while mediocre and, generic has some shining moments. These include Issei discovering his powers, the rescue of Asia from the fallen angels and, some hilarious moments of comic relief. The second arc is where shit gets kicked into overdrive and, the show runners must have realized that  fuck! there is more to anime than just fan service. They introduce an absolute arrogant prick of an asshole who is like the perfect douchebag character and, you just want to see him get his ass kicked. \\n\\n\r\nI have a like/dislike relationship with Issei in a way I can relate to him because I was in his shoes at one point just obsessing over girls and, he does have his moments of shear awesomeness but, the fact that he is as perverted as he is and, has no other objective aside from being harem king its not exactly what you want out of a protagonist. The servants of house Gremory are interesting but, lack development of any kind which sucks because they seem to have interesting backstories. Rias who at first seems like strong independent badass that you would follow into was eventually succumbs to damsel in distress syndrome. \\n\\n\r\nThe elephant in the room when it comes to the show is fan service. I have no issues with fan service and, I enjoy it from time to time as it can be pretty hot at times. However this show goes absolutely overbooked with the amount of fan service it eventually got to a point where I didn't want to see a pair of tits on screen ever again. Not to mention while it was hot sometimes it was uncomfortable as, some of the girls were technically underage and that is where I draw the line.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is one of those shows where if you turn your brain off and, look at the show for what it is you'll have a blast. If you want depth or something emotionally compelling you've come to the wrong place. I recommend watching the show if you have got absolutely nothing better to do with you day.",

            "content": "When my friends recommended me Highschool DxD, and I actually got around to watching the first episode, I didn't think I would get any further then that. I despise fan service in anime, and calling this an ecchi anime doesn't do it justice. I gave Highschool of the Dead an overall score of 3, just for perspective.\r\nHowever, with how much the friends that recommended this show to me enjoyed it, I soldiered on, against my better judgement. Let me tell you, I don't regret a second of it. \r\nStory: 4\r\nListen, I said I enjoyed the show, but certain aspects of it are lacking. I blamethe lack of story on this being an ecchi anime. Four years ago you could've confused the director of this show with me. The only reason the score for story isn't lower is because in the world this show created, the legitimate story, such as the three-way war between angels, devils, and arch-angels, actually makes sense, and makes up for the constant nipple in your face.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nSaying this show has fan service doesn't tell the whole story. You could find this series in the softcore section of a hentai website. However, the show's art is very impressive. It has fluid, vivid, and, sometimes, downright stunning animation. The fight scenes alone are awe inspiring. Can't forget to put a titty in whenever possible. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nAgainst my better judgement, I'm giving the sound category an 8. The intro wasn't bad, but after the first two episodes, I just ended up skipping it. The outro got the same treatment. It's disappointing when even Highschool of the Dead had a catchy intro I sat and listened to. The reason the sound category's score is as high as it is is because the dub for this show is downright fantastic. I prefer watching anime dubbed, but will switch over to sub if the dub just doesn't fit the show. I can tell you right now that the dub is amazing. Jamie Marchi's acting for Rias is FANTASTIC. Issei's and Asia's actors also do fantastic work. Now that I think about it, no character in this show had an actor in the dub that didn't fit with them. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 4\\n\\n\r\nIssei is a pervert, plain and simple. For supposedly being a former nun, Asia is incredibly easy. For some reason, Akeno is a sadist. I'm gonna stop myself. Issei's slight evolution as a character and Rias as a person carry the entire show's cast. Plain and simple.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nI told myself, even as late as episode seven or eight, that this was probably going to get an overall rating of four, maybe five (only because of how much I found myself chuckling at the stupid stuff this show pulled in order to show a titty, or get Issei \"laid\") but then I finished the show, and I can tell you, if you're like me, soldier through it. The latter half of the show more than makes up for the former half. Hopefully Issei's character goes more in depth later on, more than just the perverted high school boy.",

And I like to think that I speak for the majority of us when I say that we have all had that one daydream in which we imagine ourselves as the most popular and attractive guy at school that every girl wants to sleep with. This anime is pretty much that daydream made reality.\r\nIn this show, we follow the young high-school boy Issei Hyoudou, who, unlike others who dream of academic success and having a lot of money, has a rather simple goal in life. He wants to beHarem-King. As in he wants to have the largest harem known to man. With this respectable goal in mind, he sets out on his journey to conquer women and build his peerage. And boy, does he succeed.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one simple fact that we as viewers have to keep in mind when watching this show: everyone, and I mean EVERYONE wants a ride at the Issei Express. Black-haired, half-angel, daughter to one of the most dangerous creatures known to man? Completely reformed after the Issei D. Up-and-coming heir to the throne of the underworld, next in line to be crowned Satan herself? Conquered and subdued by Issei, the harem demon.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching enough episodes of this show, you'll hit the point where you wish it actually WAS a hentai rather than an anime, just so you could see Issei fully \"liberate\" all of these girls. The sheer amount of fan-service and sexual tension in this show is simply through the roof.\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to a black hole, Issei's harem just. doesn't. stop. expanding. It will get bigger and bigger the longer you watch, and your d*ck will get harder and harder as it does. Its pretty much like watching hentai without the actual \"act\", a complete c*cktease.\\n\\n\r\nIf you decide to watch this show, I can almost guarantee you that you will pop a boner at least once or twice, so don't watch this show in close proximity to someone you would rather not disappoint. Its the perfect \"disappoint-your-parents starter package\", and I wouldn't want it any other way.\\n\\n\r\nSo godspeed my fellow gentlemen, and good luck explaining to your friends that its not hentai when they inevitably catch you watching it.",

By the time you reach episode 5, there's a good chance you could be in tears. The characters are the strongest point of this series and they become very quick to love,and with their supernatural abilities they become involved in many fast paced battles that with hold your attention. I won't lie, the series is very much saturated with fanservice, but the more you watch the more you realize it's so much more than that. Even if you're the kind of person who is tuning in for the  fanservice, by the time you finish the first season you'll find that's no longer the reason you're watching it. Likewise, if the fanservice turns you off, you'll find that you've pushed it to the back of your mind in favor of the wonderful characters and story the series has going for it.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, don't shelve this series because of the nudity.

The art good no comment about it. The sound has a great part of it to each character. The characters were far interesting than i expected with Rias as a demon although she kinda confused me when she slept with Issei naked and im like uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh huh. The enjoyment mostly like this, ASS, TITTIES,ASS,ASS AND TITTIES -repeatedly- and the action and story is cool too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Although the many parts of fanservice gets into hand i liked this one and given alot of parts into the story and the show little to know that if you like this stuff go watch if u dont dont bother about it or either this review\\n\\n\r\n8/10 Great show :P",

            "content": "Okay, well Highschool DxD is a good show so long as you are not weird-ed out by getting a boner from anime. The show follows a highschool guy who becomes a demon and desperately wants a harem and is a huge hilarious pervert. Let's all be honest, the only reason anyone ever watches this show is for the boobs. And that is totally okay. There is no show out there with more continuous fan service than Highschool DxD. These girls are smoking hot. However, something strange happens when you watch this show (dubbed version). \r\nI started the show to see tits, but after the firstor second episode the most appealing part of the show becomes the dialogue. The shit these character say makes this show absolutely hilarious especially when paired with the ridiculous sexual situations. Imagine all the most stereotypical american highschool sayings, suck it, bro, bazongas, fun bags, an so so many more. The two best characters that show this are Koneko and Issei. They constantly get into situations where Koneko beats the shit out of Issei and calls him a pervert.\\n\r\nAnother surprising aspect of the show is how the story develops (super tiny spoiler). Now, I by no mean am trying to tell you that it has a great plot, far from it. However, By the last half of the season certain plot elements emerge such as large battles all dictated by certain traits of chess. It's actually pretty interesting and if the whole show was oriented around this idea it would actually be a pretty awesome show, with boobs.\\n\r\nI really recommend watching this show especially as a follow up to a serios dramatic show. Its a good cool down show to just kick back and enjoy. And there are tons of boobs, like seriously almost every scene... yeah it's awesome.",

            "content": "I would like to first say that I went into this knowing nothing of the series. I had heard about it from a friend, and decided to give it a try. After the first few sentences I was already interested, but also weary of it as well. It mentions boobs within the first 30 seconds, which usually means the anime is super sleazy. I decided to continue watching. The first episode was interesting, but it hadn't hooked me. I went to the second episode, and by the end I was hooked. Although it had already seen a nipple (Which I'm not saying I don't enjoy,but excess nudity is used in a lot of anime to make up for a shit story line) the story seemed interesting. I continued to watch, and was surprised with the mixture of nudity and a good story. Which, let's just be honest... nudity makes everything better. The story caught me off guard, since I dove into it completely new. I thought it was going to be about a kid who's just constantly horny but can't get a girl.  It ended up being much more than that. I enjoyed the story a lot, so much so that I was inclined to actually watch the second season, which I did. Overall, I enjoyed this anime quite a lot. It's only 12 episodes, so you can finish it in one night! It won't be that much of a waste of time if you don't like it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to add on a little thing I just thought of but couldn't figure out where to put it in this glob of text... the character development, of the main character at least, is amazing. Maybe not to everyone, but his perversion is portrayed so well... and being a teen myself, I can relate a little.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing wrong I had against this anime... When things get serious or sad or any intimidating emotion that would usually make you feel so... just \"mmf!\" there is always a tit hanging out. Just Saying. \\n\r\n8/10",

            "content": "a brief summary, Highschool dxd is about demons with powers and such fitted in with romance and action. There is also a huge spam of boobs nipples and asses.\r\nThe story starts off quite smoothly as shown in the summaries provided by ANN, gets confessed by a girl, then ends up being killed by her at the end of their date.\r\nHe then gets turned into a demon and is told he has a special power called sacred gear. I felt comfortable with the story and the anime being only about the story and not drifting off to be something else or having overly long 3 episodetopics. The story flowed really well for me through the 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt. Nothing to complain about! it was great! The details added in especially shown on their outfits and on Issei's sacred gear. I would say that the ecchi added in could have been cut down some what, it is not necessary to add nipple outprints each scene when ever there is a closeup on a girl. \\n\\n\r\nSound, nothing special. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters were nicely done, however I could imagine Issei's perverseness cut down abit would help to attract more veiwers because eventually got really annoying. The verity of characters are well developed and did not look like each other at all which helped greatly with character distinction. Each character is special to their own traits and is shown also, no one is left out!\\n\r\nIssei being a perver, Asia being a timid priest girl, Rias as a loved leader, Akeno as a sadistic person, Koneko as a girl who boats on strenght and who has no emotion, and so fourth. I felt that the character's individual traits played a big role in addition to making the story more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment..... I am going to have to say fair, maybe a bit lower.\\n\r\nAt times while I was actually enjoying the anime, I would find it anoying because of the overly large breast and nipples showing beneath the clothing, it eventually got anoying. However the ecchi element is an added comedic relief to the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I felt the story was good if not great, If you are a fan of supernatural and romances, you would enjoy this. However if you don't exactly find perverse topics funny then eventually you would get annoyed.",

            "content": "High School DxD looked like your typical harem/action/drama anime like those of previous seasons such as Ladies vs Butlers, R-15, Kampfer and Maken-Ki. Even though HSDXD follows the same agenda, it's significantly better than the harem animes I mentioned.\r\nStory.\r\nSo what's better? Well for one the story line is a lot more coherent and serious. Yes there are some silly moments, but the story line does progress mostly every episode and it does it rather quickly which is kind of a downer since it seemed like there was more to it than it seemed. Though it's not their fault. Harem animes like this one (where theygo full nude) tend to get less opportunities for 13+ episodes and the only one that does come to mind that has gone more than that is Seikon No Quasar which I thought was ok. If you were to compare the story line progression with another anime like R-15 or Maken-Ki, I'd say this anime trumps them both significantly. Still since it's sort of rushed, it does have a few plot holes (though not on the level of Guilty Crown which is full of them). So I give it a 7. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nArt is decent. The action scenes are pretty good. The girls are attractive and it does show blood which is surprising since some harem animes tend to leave that kind of stuff out. I give it a solid 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nNot particularly great. It's your typical jpop stuff, though some of the background music is pretty such as when they show the \"president\" they play a violin melody, adds a nice taste. I give it a 6.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe characters are actually a lot more interesting except that not all of them get an in depth look. The only ones that do are Asia, Issei and Rias, who are pretty much the main leads. Still this a harem anime so character development isn't much of a big deal, but it was a nice addition to the boobs and a** they show on a regular basis. Still the characters are likeable which is a good thing. Though Issei is a pervert, he's not a bad guy as he proved when he saved Asia and Rias. I give them a 7.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime. It wasn't stupid like R-15. It didn't suffer from crappy characters and story like Maken-Ki. It was actually pretty decent which is kind of rare in a harem anime of this type. Yes there are a few plot holes and the end is pretty open ended which leaves hope for consecutive seasons. Overall I give this anime a 7, which is pretty good in my opinion since many harem animes don't usually get this much attention in character and story development. Still if you don't like boobs or nudity or perverted stuff, I wouldn't recommend it. You probably won't like it, but if you don't mind that stuff, you should definitely watch this. It's a lot better than some of the other harem stuff that has come out the previous seasons.",

The story tries to focus on a lot of things and along the way, we're served with a lot of different stuff from dragons to angels to devils to sacred powers to sword fighters to God wars.\r\nToo many panty shots. Girls' clothes MUST tear apart when in fight (no, not true for boys at all). Music is excellent. It's makes fora great comedy. Not too much drama in it. Not too many dialogues.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are pretty okay I would say and when they're not spilling too much friendship stuff and how-I'm-stronger-than-you stuff, it's actually interesting to watch the fight scenes.

Without this outlook I'd give this a 4. Highschool DXD is trying to be an in-your-face fan service/comedy show and it excels at this, in fact I'd say it is one of the best of its kind. The characters are flat but they don't need depth, that's not why you should watch this show, you watch this show tosee oppai on hot depictions of humans.

Starts of with the MC believing hes the weakest link when in actuality he just need practice on unleashing his FULL power. . . and when he does its insane! This anime has great character development. I loved it so much that I finished the 1st 2 seasons within a day! Its super entertaining and no episode is filler. All plot from 1st episode on out! Thats all I have to say about this anime its outstanding! This anime keeps telling me to write a longer review but thisis all there is to this anime. Oh and also male characters goal  is to one day become a harem king",

            "content": "***This is a spoiler free review***\r\nThe opening scene of High School DxD gave me the impression it was going to be another generic no nonsense ecchi school anime. Twelve episodes later however, I find myself a little baffled at how much I enjoyed it.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nWhile this show\u2019s premise is not very ambitious, it isn\u2019t horrible either. The show starts out with our pal Issei dying from a spear wound from a demon b!tch in a park all alone. His last words call out to our \u201cloaded\u201d red headed president Rias who allows Issei to continue on living by becoming a demon. The plot in generalactually had a very nice pace; there wasn\u2019t any section of the anime where I thought it was dragging. We have the beginning events, the laid back period where most of the stuff happens at school, then the main conflict which arises and ends all within twelve episodes. Most shows that follow in the ecchi format are nothing more than eleven filler episodes with the studio scrambling at the end to make some sh!tty ending. High School DxD genuinely was an interesting show to watch. It didn\u2019t go over the top with its premise but it was far from boring. Some might argue the ecchi content might have gotten in the way but generally since our protagonist is a perv anyway, it didn\u2019t distract me\u2026too much.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSo I was lucky enough to get to see this on a BD copy of the movie (courtesy of a friend). The visuals are quite well done; every character model was constantly presented very well, the backgrounds had attention to detail, and fight scenes had great feudality. AND YES for all of you who are just going to watch this for the ecchi stuff do not fret, all the scenes that point out the most awkward camera angles are here for you to enjoy. The BD copy does not hold back at all; where the broadcasted version was heavily censored (at least I was told it was), it's no holds bar here. But like I have stated in my other reviews, I am part of that weird percent of anime viewers that do not watch for the \u201cscenes\u201d; if a show has an interesting plot and very well written characters, I can sit through it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7.2/10\\n\\n\r\nI am very picky about sound since I spend most of my time around music. While the musical score for this anime isn\u2019t genericly bad, it is somewhat average. The music that plays during the fight scenes and around the school sound like any other anime\u2019s soundtrack; there just wasn\u2019t a whole lot of originality here. The voice actors however did a pretty good job; everything was recorded fairly well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAgain while the characters were not \u201cOMG AMAZING\u201d, they also were not a hindrance to the anime. The club\u2019s characters all have an overlying personality that may be somewhat generic but we are exposed to them enough through character development that I started to like all of them by the end of the show. Even though Issei is a pervert crybaby, he genuinely grows throughout the show and becomes pretty badass by the final fight.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.1/10\\n\\n\r\nI was so sure that after the first episode I was going to have another Champione! experience (in other words, a generic boring ecchi anime). But this show really surprised me; even though there was a lot of ecchi content, it worked itself fairly well into the show and since the animation was very good backed with a decent cast, it was overall a good watch. It exceeded my expectations so why not yours?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review! If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!\\n\\n\r\nSincerely,\\n\r\nAwesome Drummer",

            "content": "Great show!\r\nIf there's two harems i really like (and I like my harems) it's Data a Live and High School DxD. One could call it Yin-Yang sorta thing are both of them are polar opposites of eachoter. \r\nIf you want extremely charming, loveable and kindhearted girls that surround the painfully mediocre protagonist in happy/silly spoof on eroge games with some grim moments then Date a Live is where it's at. \r\nConversly if you want a group of nice, but not absolutely genre - breaking and memory defining girls swarming a kickass protagonist that you'll love from the first sight then this show is for you.Not to mention the humor here is also top notch, albeit of a more perverted sort ;)\\n\\n\\n\r\nMeet Hyodo Issei, the proud boobie lover and pervert. A virgin (not so proud there;). And basically an anime bro to most of guys out there in our high school years. Life is brutal for Issei. Albeit he's in a school which majority of students being female and guys being very few and far between, poor soul still doesn't get to see any action (not for lack of trying to peep on girls mind you) as the girls, just like in real life will all swarm the top handsome, top grading and excellent in sports Kiba, completely ignoring existence of normal perv...guys like Issei along with laws of physics (300 girls can't have same guy). \\n\\n\r\nBut we didn't come here to see a mopey loser cry about his life, we came to see a charismatic teenage perv get his harem + his boobies and kick some ass while making you laugh yours off in the running time of this mix of comedy and shounen with some demonic aspects.\\n\\n\r\nLong story short after his first date ending not the way he wanted (brutally killed by fallen angel pretending to be his first gf) he is resurrected by his secret school crush who turns out to be a high ranking devil and learns that as the next morning he finds her in his bed, naked and not very shy about the situation or her body. Rias (his actual firstgirl experience) leads him on a journey to strenghtening as his hidden ability marked him as target for the world of occult and he needs to get on top of his game fast to survive. \\n\\n\r\n...right after complaning to himself (with curse words :>) about having a naked girl in bed and not remembering jack about his first time!\\n\r\nThis is what makes this show awesome. Issei is 100% honest with himself, you get a ton of laughs from his pure, honest perverted reactions and 0% bullshit about his desires and plain honest manly, hormone driven agenda;) He also get his badass moments when we feel his anger and root for him with all our perveted might, that just tops the \"i love this MC chart\".\\n\\n\r\nHere's where girls come in, as unlike a flock of femnazi harpies which some of harem shows are sadly known for (Love Hina for one!) Issei is not treated like a rag, a piece of trash and generally being used and abused on every step by his new demonic family. The girls are very friendly to Issei and while powerful, you never see any of them try to abuse that power on Issei. This is awesome as it builds the strength of bond he has with them and let's him grow as a man, unlike the so many harem protagonists that are castrated by their female crew, for no good reason apparently as they didn't have any balls to begin with!\\n\\n\r\nWhile not so much in season one there is development in girls where over time we learn more about them and the more reluctant ones (church emiisaries + Koneko) will warm up to issei. \\n\\n\r\nAnother strong entry is Issei's \"power\", which turns out is a soul of extremely powerful dragon locked away in a \"sacred gear\" that took form of a gauntlet. Draig (as that's his name) greatly fills the role of badass dragon on Issei's side, sometimes acting as bit of a father figure, that hopelessly tries to cling to any remnants of his dragon dignity as Issei's pervertness makes even dragons admit defeat ;)\\n\\n\r\nBut all that is me running my mouth over something that should be put in two sentences:\\n\\n\r\nA great show that gave me an insanely likeable protagonist and tons of laughs with mandatory boobies! ;) Go watch it, now!\\n\\n",

Pero a mi me encanta, la habr\u00e9 comenzado a ver cuando tenia cerca de 12 o 13 a\u00f1os, en ese entonces, era un chico con la cabeza llena de testosterona y si llegaba a mirar un simple pez\u00f3n, ya la tenia mas dura que una pared. Fue, en ese entonces, que me introduje a \u201cHigh School DxD\u201d, no me acuerdo muy bien cuando ni como comenc\u00e9 a mirarla, pero creo que fuepor un PV o un AMV, donde mostraba im\u00e1genes sobre la novela ligera, me intereso mucho el arte con el que estaba dibujado las caras y cuerpos del protagonista y sus compa\u00f1eras; aunque estos correspond\u00edan a la novela ligera, decid\u00ed ver el anime.\\n\\n\r\nCreo yo que, en ese entonces, nunca me pude haber dado cuenta que estaba entrando a un mundo completamente nuevo, donde disfrutar\u00eda de horas y horas, leyendo, mirando y sonriendo desde el fondo del coraz\u00f3n. \\n\\n\r\nLa Primera Temporada de HSDxD es, sin duda alguna, la puerta hacia la casa en la cual te vas a hospedar, es el comienzo, es subirte a un tren y no saber en que estaci\u00f3n bajar, o por lo menos, eso fue para m\u00ed. Seguramente muchas personas no lo ven as\u00ed y lo ven como un anime mediocre y poco interesante, uno que te saca de la acci\u00f3n o que simplemente es puro fanservice, pero para mi fue m\u00e1s que eso.\\n\\n\r\nEn los primeros cap\u00edtulos vemos como nos presentan a Hyoudou Issei, nuestro protagonista, quien vive su vida siendo un pervertido y espiando a las hermosa chicas de su escuela, esta era su vida normal hasta que desafortunadamente es asesinado por quien era su novia. A partir de este momento, comenzamos a recibir mucha informaci\u00f3n, sobre el mundo, sobre el mismo Issei y tambi\u00e9n sobre quien es su nuevo amo. Ya que Issei reencarna en un demonio.\\n\\n\r\nIssei comienza a relacionarse en su nuevo entorno y comienza a tomar cari\u00f1o de sus compa\u00f1eros y comienza a experimentar nuevas experiencias, valga la redundancia y vemos un crecimiento enorme de quien era en el capitulo 1, y quien se convirti\u00f3 en el capitulo 12. \\n\\n\r\nComo dije antes ya sea por la testosterona en mi cabeza o porque realmente me atra\u00eda la historia, me termine metiendo en el mundo de HSDxD, me converti en un fanboy.\\n\r\nS\u00e9 de primera mano que no a muchos les va a gustar como lo hace a m\u00ed y que el primer vistazo que tienen con High School DxD es brusco por todo su ecchi y fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nMi review sobre su primera temporada es que:\\n\\n\r\n- O es el primer paso para amar la serie.\\n\\n\r\n- O es un paso atr\u00e1s para no volver a verla de nuevo.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMi consejo antes de ver High School DxD es que no esperes nada, anda con la mente en blanco y d\u00e9jate atraer por su m\u00fasica, su mundo y en especial, sus personajes.\\n",

            "content": "Great Googly Moogly \r\nWhat can I say about High School DXD. It is a great anime with a lot of fan service. If you love lewd thoughts, high sexual fantasy and perversion, then this is a series for you. If you don't then don't bother watching this anime, go find something that you enjoy.  \r\nLet us begin with the story, it is  about Issei Hyoudou, your average high school student who could be classed as weak main character but becomes powerful with the sacred gear he was given. He calls himself the 'Harem King' and has a dream of having his own harem,but anyone would if they were studying at an all girls school, as this is every guys dream. But this all changes when he meets a girl and they start dating. But if you want to read a synopsis of this anime read the summary.  \\n\\n\r\nBut anyway it is good to see when they created this series they thought about how many people who watch it would be able to compare themselves to the main character.  \\n\\n\r\nThe art of the anime is excellent, when you watch this anime you can see that the all the animators took their time creating a lot of images that would stick in your mind so that you would not forget them easily. \\n\\n\r\nThe sounds are good, as everything sounds so realistic that if you were to close your eyes you would be able to create a mental picture of all the sounds in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are created very well, as when you watch this anime you are able to get a lot of depth of each of the characters that the main character meets. For all those who have watched the series they know what I mean when I mention Milton. If you have not watched this anime series then you guys have something to look forward to. \\n\\n\r\nYou might think 'Will I enjoy watching this series'. The answer is yes, you will. Like I said at the beginning of the review that it has a lot of fan service, a lot of ecchi and a lot of perversion. And If you are like me and enjoy that kind of thing then you will definitely enjoy this series. It has a lot of comedy from a perverted mind, so you will also have a smile on your face when you watch this series. \\n\\n\r\nAnother good thing is that after watching High School DXD you can be glad to know that there is a second season and that it as good as the first. But I am not going to go into that anime as this isn't a review that series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed this series, so much so that I am watching it for the third time. So I can guarantee that you would watch this series at least twice. \\n\\n\r\nSo to summarize it is a great anime with lots of perversion and ecchi. The main character becomes a bad ass and the girls are cute. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read the review I hope it helps and I hope you enjoyed it.           \\n",

If you are not bothered by Ecchi contents here and there.\r\n2. If you are planning to watch this just for timepass.\r\nThis is a typical harem anime with ecchi in it.\r\n But what makes it stand out is the way in which it is made interesting from the beginning, unlike some anime which would take some time you get you involved totally in it, this one grabs your attention in the 1st episode itself.\r\nAt the time of this writing 11 episodes have been released andam eagerly waiting for the 12th episode release with english subs.\\n\\n\\n\r\nGive it a try, watch first few episodes..

            "content": "Personally, I loved the anime and the light novels which I still need to finish. The anime has a beautiful story hidden beneath all of the cleavage and tits that a lot of people don't see because they focus on how ecchi it is. I personally prefer to watch this show censored because a) its easier to explain to people, and b) the tits sort of draw from the story. \r\nNow, as far as that story goes, it is definitely one of my favorites. It feels to me as if it is a perverted representation of Milton's Paradise Lost which is one of the greatestclassics ever written and one that I believe deserves the name \"classic\". The anime and light novels each also draw upon a great number of other myths and mythologies, which for me was a reason that I fell in love with this show. I greatly love the depictions of mythological characters in this anime and how they fit into the show. The only regretable thing that I don't really like about Highschool DxD is its incredibly powerful anti-religious message. Though I am not a die-hard Christian, this factor makes it impossible for me to recommend this anime to any of my religious friends. It is easy for me to get past and I did not let it factor into my review since I presume most people truly won't care.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are incredibly funny and the show, on the surface, is really lighthearted. However, as you dive deeper, you find this deeply rooted psychological experience manifesting itself within each of the characters within the show. Each character has a tragic past that makes them broken and each of those experiences is what drives their relationships with the other characters. Each character feels unique to me and I love each and every one of them. Even the bad guys are all pretty cool even though they are douches that you quickly learn to hate\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the soundtrack goes, I really like this soundtrack. The opening is one of my favorites and the ending makes me laugh every time I see it. I do like the OSTs as well, though against anime such as Attack on Titan, Campione!, and Guilty Crown, it doesn't stand out that much. As such, it lost one point for me there.\\n\\n\r\nIn light of all that, I'd still say that it is a great anime despite what others have to say and it will always be one of my favorites. I love the art and I love the characters. The story is deep if you actually look for and pay attention to it. Personally, I feel aggravated whenever anyone says that this show is just tits because its just not the case. It is one of the best Harem genre anime that has earned its high spot on my list.",

There is also a bit of gore thrown in as well, though it's only really in the beginning and ending halves of the show.)\r\n(+) The characters are fun, with the most favorable points going to our perverted protagonist Issei, who is probably written much better than others like him. The music is addicting (ESPECIALLY that ending), theart is fairly good, and the story, while cliche in some aspects, had a lot of cool action scenes and is just fun all around. \\n\\n\r\n(-) The only real negative I can find here is that the earlier fanservice is pretty bad (especially in episodes 4 and 5, where it's a little...um...misplaced in a certain section). I will also say that beyond the main cast and the recurring cast, the other characters aren't written well, in that there are only two modes they can be on: over the top villain or regular annoying high schoolers.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I just really enjoyed this show for what it was and had a good time with it. If you can handle boobs and blood, then you should really give this show a try, since it's much more fun than some other entries that have come out in the genre lately.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. That ending is seriously awesome and I don't care what anyone else says about it. XD",

Don't get me wrong the girls in this show are beautiful and definitely a plus but when I am re-watching this show in anticipation of season 4 (coming out in April 2018, So hyped) I am really invested in this story it takesthe front seat .

            "content": "Right. Let's get down to it.\r\nThis. is. Echhi. Pure, hardcore, ecchi, with a garnishing of story to give us something to watch. The point of this anime is not the story at all, so if that is what you are looking for, well, you have come to the wrong place.\r\nThat said, the attention to detail when it comes to the ecchi is pretty amazing. For example, you can hear the breasts softly squishing when released from their consraints (when they are large enough that is).\r\nStory: 2/10\r\nIn terms of story and charterer development, the series is......well there isn't much of either to be honest. Half ofthe plot lines are left unexplained, and very little makes sense if you think about it for more than half a minute. The protagonist doesn't grow up at all, which I find inconceivable. Sure, starting of as a raging teenage pervert is all well and good (all of us were like that one point of time before we grew up), but Issei Hyoudo remains the same inspite of being exposed to naked females at every corner. It becomes irritating after a point of time when he remains exactly like he was in the first episode, without any growth.\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nThe art is not really amazing, nor is it really bad. it just....is. \\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nWhile the soundtracks are mediocre, I am giving this a seven just because of the attention to detail when it comes to the smaller background sounds.\\n\r\nCharachter: 3/10\\n\r\nAll shallow (except for Rias Gremory. She actually has some depth to her, surprisingly), with little to no growth.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nWhat can I say? I like breasts.\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\ntbh. Rias is the saving grace of this series, both because of her body and because of her character. None of the other characters seem to have any real depth to them.",

I think this anime is really overrated doesn't not mean its bad I actually enjoyed it but people that are giving 8-10 review scores thats why its overrated. the highest score this anime should get is a 7/10 but lets start the review. lets start withthe story/plot everybody says high school dxd story/plot is the best in that case its very overrated high school dxd story is ok it gets the job done its not bad but its not good. the story follows a main character named Issei Issei is in highschool and one day he gets killed by a fallen angel and he gets brought back to life by a a girl named Rias Gremory turns out to be a devil and he becomes her devil servant. and thats the story without giving to much away. now the characters for me is the worst part about this anime it is your classic pervert main character and hot girls that want to be with the main character. each character is the stereotype lacking personality and lacking a back story for most of the characters very plain characters. now the Fan Service in this anime is way to over the top so so if you hate fan service DO NOT WATCH this anime. this anime will put it in with ever chance they get. I mean I dont mind fan service but this show even puts it in at the worst times example during a serious scene or during serious fighting moments. the fan service almost mad me hate this anime with its over the top fain service. but with all that said. to High school dxd credit this is one of the few ecci anime I can actual watch. the one saving grace this anime has is the fighting scenes even with the fan service in the fighting scenes I still really enjoyed the fighting scenes. the art and sound are solid no issues here. Overall I really enjoyed this anime series but the problems and Issues and very apparent most notably the fan service.",
