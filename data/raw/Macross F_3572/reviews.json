            "content": "*A Stunning Revival of a 25 Years Old Series.*\r\n\"Simple, easy to comprehend plot. Skillfully developed love triangle. Masterpiece level animation and music.\"\r\nTo those who are new to the Macross franchise, you can find some info on it here. Now first to clarify a thing for those who are confused with the \"Macross Frontier Deculture Edition\". The difference is simply that the Deculture Edition is the \"pilot episode\" of the TV series. Another way of putting it is an OVA version of episode 1 of the TV series which was aired ~3 months later.\r\nTaking place 47 years (story-wise) after the original series, Super Dimension Fortress Macross.We are now in the year 2059 AD. The Space War with the Zentradi was long since over and the new migration fleet, Macross Frontier, is now under attack by a new alien race. The story revolves around a love triangle and how the three cope with each other while dealing with the threats from the aliens.\\n\\n\r\nThe battle animations are absolutely STUNNING. Fluid CG battle animations to very detailed character outlook are very much the highly for the show. One can even tell that the background for most scenery were well thought out and well designed. Oh, and very consistent quality of animation. \\n\\n\r\n\"1st Anime Album in 11 Years to Rank in Japan's Top 3\"\\n\\n\r\n\"Two Macross Frontier Singles in Japan's Weekly Top 10\"\\n\\n\r\n\"All four of the Macross Frontier singles that have been released have debuted at #5 or higher.\"\\n\\n\r\nHow does that sound for starter? The Macross series were largely famous for its music as they all played an integral part in every single Macross title. However, one can say Macross Frontier have taken the anime song industry to a whole new golden era! Both the singer and seiyu responsible for singing the second OP won awards for their fabulous works.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of characters developments happened in the latter half of the series making it a bit boring to watching in the beginning (as far as characters are concerned). However this is balanced by Sheryl Nome's character development which was extremely well done especially toward to the end of the series.We also be Alto and Ranka mature over time (albeit very late in the series).\\n\\n\r\nThe series as a whole was very well made with amazing sound effects and graphic. The love triangle between the 3 protagonists was interesting to watch as well. It was painful to see the show end, but at least it was announced that a movie is underway.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*Update on February 10, 2009*\\n\r\nIf you liked Macross Frontier, you may be happy to know that it was voted by anime fans a week ago as THE anime of 2008. In addtion, May'n (Sheryl's singing VA) also got voted as one of the top anime singer.",

            "content": "Macross Frontier isn\u2019t merely another sci-fi space opera.  Despite incorporating just about every anime clich\u00e9 in the book\u2014from school drama to mecha to moe to the love triangles that are the Macross franchise\u2019s signature\u2014Macross Frontier manages to create something that is simultaneously the maximum fulfillment of its genre\u2019s capacity and also the complete and utter subversion of its viewer\u2019s expectations.  It\u2019s been hailed as the SDF-Macross of the 21st Century, and there\u2019s no doubt about that; even for viewers unfamiliar with the original Macross series, Macross Frontier bridges nearly every gap imaginable to create something that will undoubtedly stand the test of timeas its original predecessor has.\\n\\n\r\nThe directing is superb, though I cannot say with much conviction that it\u2019s entirely noteworthy.  The signature tracking shots of dog-fighters have been given extraordinary retrofits with wonderful CGI integration, and immediately call to any Macross fan\u2019s mind the meticulously drawn epic battles of the original series and its companion film, yet they still manage to remain largely unique.  This lies in the masterful art direction and consistently top-notch quality found throughout the whole series, giving the impression of absolute relevancy yet remaining \u201cMacross\u201d enough to justify just enough nostalgia to appeal to any fan.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is easily one of the series\u2019 highlights (though it shouldn\u2019t be said that it is its best feature, considering how utterly well-done the series as a whole is).  Yoko Kanno provides the perfect musical accompaniment to the lovely vocals of Megumi Nakajima and May Nakabayashi.  The climax of the whole show provides one of the most interesting medley collages of music I\u2019ve ever encountered, and pretty much reestablishes (or at least adds credence to) Yoko Kanno\u2019s position as one of the greatest soundtrack composers of all time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s the narrative.  This is a show that takes everything the last decade\u2019s anime had to offer, rolls it up into a single coherent narrative, and manages to not only pull off a great story, but actually USE these tropes, clich\u00e9s, and techniques as something more than they\u2019re usually intended.  Its surface-level plot is utterly brilliant in its simplicity, as it allows the deeper aspects of its meta-themes to shine through\u2014particularly its rather odd-yet-genius juxtaposition of moe, school drama, and slice-of-life with mecha, space opera, sci-fi, and action of apocalyptic scope.  While this may not be entirely new to the genre\u2014nor even to the Macross franchise, seeing as how SDF-Macross did something along these lines on its own\u2014it should be noted that Macross Frontier raises the bar with its ability to pull these ideas (and more) into a cohesive narrative structure.\\n\\n\r\nIts seemingly simplistic plot allows for character development in leaps and bounds, to the point that just about every character in the series is fleshed out enough to be a well-rounded and three-dimensional device.  Despite this, Macross Frontier remains a heavily plot-driven show, as much of the conflict created between the characters\u2014masterfully handled as it is\u2014remains largely unresolved through interactions and relies on plot-driven consequences in order to keep the whole narrative flowing.  At times this peeks through as a detriment, but for the most part the show manages to balance itself out.  To its credit, it never fully lapses into ungrounded melodrama and angst in order to illustrate character interaction, and seems to be acutely aware of the fine line between well-executed drama and baseless moaning.  In compensation for its shortcomings with overall character drive, the plot takes advantage of allegory and an abundant use of vague foreshadowing to create an ever-shifting storyline that never really has a chance to congeal into a set routine.  \\n\\n\r\nThis is a series that will have you grinning madly with anticipation, overwhelmed with the intensity of the action, and feeling the impact of rejection, doubt, and loss.  It\u2019s a fantastic introduction to the Macross franchise, and it\u2019s the perfect successor to the Macross name.  Recommended to any fan of anime.",

            "content": "Macross Frontier, the latest installment to the 25-year-old mecha franchise, is so promising in every aspect early on that once the flaws become more apparent and begin to hinder to the series, it still remains watchable. But despite the rough patches the series hits, it is ultimately a very worthwhile watch.\r\nOne of Frontier's most endearing aspects is that it carries the Macross mythos while never alienating new audiences. Bringing with it all the cliches and plot devices that relegate the Macross universe, Frontier tells an solid stand-alone story that still connects well with the previous series before it. Frontier also succeeds in carrying as manytwists as red herrings. This is bound to keep the audience on their feet and doubting any obvious plot twist. Viewers may be disappointed later on though, when some plot twists turn out just like they predicted.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Frontier is one of those red herrings. From the start, the characters are fresh, lively and interesting, but it's all a lie because about a quarter of the way through, they all turn into relegated one-dimensional personas and some, like the sad case of main character Alto, stay that way the entire series. Frontier also suffers character-wise from a large starting cast. Many members of the cast will often be unseen for several episodes because so much time is rightfully demanded of Ranka and Sheryl. Because of this, the series does not properly develop anyone's character, outside an episode dedicated to a single character.\\n\\n\r\nComparing Frontier to it's primary ancestor is a dramatic change in animation. Frontier makes full use of CG for concert scenes and battle scenes, and does so without giving the series a tacky feel. Everything looks fluid and detailed, but the series has a penchant for being too detailed in which so much goes on in a single frame that it's hard to follow, though its arguable if that's a flaw or not given the psychedelic feel of the concert scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThough Yoko Kanno's OST is not one of her better works, the sound spotlight falls heavily on newcomers Megumi Nakajima and May'n, who lend their singing talents to Ranka and Sheryl respectively, giving us a jukebox's worth of catchy tunes each with their own distinctive style. From the viral Deculture jingle to the solemn &quot;Diamond Crevasse&quot; to the surrealistic bubblegum pop of &quot;What 'Bout My Star&quot;, there's more than enough here to keep your ears happy the whole series length.\\n\\n\r\nMacross Frontier was a series whose characters irritated the bejeezus out of me, but with a solid story, beautiful animation, and steller music, I could tolerate them enough to end this series with a smile on my face. If you're unfamiliar with the lengthly Macross franchise, this latest installment to the mythos has enough great elements to sell you on checking out the rest for sure. I know it has for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Macross Frontier an 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "Being the most anticipated anime of the spring season 08, I am NOT a bit surprised that MF turned out to be the most disappointing one. Except the incredible CG-implemented starwar-like battle scenes, there is nothing else to it, absolutely nothing. Even the music is average. The plot and the characterization are terrible too...Wait a minute, what am I talking about? There is no plot and characterization in this show. I can summarize the plot of the first eight episodes I watched into one sentence: two girls whoring around one guy plus some random battles against aliens. I'm sorry if I offended the fans butthat's how it seems to me.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is the horrible characterization. None of the characters serve any purposes nor add anything to the show. Alto is OK but he doesn't have any strong points that can make the audiences remember him. He is just a very normal very boring very bland character. The other ones are even worse. I don't know what the writers were thinking when they created Sheryl. She was first introduced as a bi...a very mean lady (ep1). Then the writer suddently decided to drop this side of her and switched her into someone who looks out for Ranka. In recent episodes she changed her personality again and apparently became jealous of Ranka for no reasons(ep6). There is not even transitions between these changes. What a messed-up character development this is. Lastly Ranka, well, I think she is only there to attract fanboys. I absolute don't see any personality in her.\\n\\n\r\nI'm starting to get a little disappointed about these new animes. None of them is even close to the ones like Eureka Seven or Ayakashi. As a matter of fact, this Macross Frontier makes Gundam Seed look like a masterpiece, and I think Seed only deserves a 7/10 at most. And may I remind you that MF is the most anticipated series of the season? I think you get my point.",

            "content": "--- Warning: Contains spoilers ---\r\nMost series can be summed up in a few words, and regardless of their implications, some descriptions may throw you for a loop. When you hear the words triangles, music, missiles, more music and even more missiles, what is it that you think of? Most well-versed anime viewers should be thinking of the Macross franchise, as this can effectively sum up a great portion of what it's all about, ranging from the original series to the latest installment entitled Frontier.\r\nMacross Frontier happens to be a fairly ordinary anime that in its simplicity, loses  direction as it progresses, only to attemptto get back on track after wasting lots of time. When you break it down, at least half of the episodes are fillers, and a majority of the rest are short arcs that don't really connect  and flow together to form a solid plot like any good series would. Since this is not an episodic series,  this format begins to hurt itself in the long run, as only little bits of crucial information about the grand scheme of things are revealed throughout the series.  This makes the progression of the main plot very slow and unnecessarily dragged out. It's not until the final third of the series that it decides to focus on what can be considered the main plot. Up until this point, the plot was nothing more than a simple \"Defend the human race from unknown aliens\", which is already weak in and of itself as it's really just a poor excuse for some mecha action, but it decided to take a sharp 180 and go down the oh so wonderful conspiracy route. \\n\\n\r\nWith this development that couldn't help but be expected many episodes  prior, everything starts to become a giant mess. This was hinted to a few times throughout the beginning of the series, usually only for a very short time period in select episodes displaying things like undercover discussions or trades, so it's not like it came on unforeseen by the audience. If anything, it happened far too late, as the motives behind Grace and Leon who were originally working together are hardly delved into, and they simply play the bad-guy role because the series needed a better antagonist than random aliens. Both individuals having very grandiose goals of wanting to rule the universe, you can't help but wonder how they actually planned on executing this in the first place. It is only explained after Grace O'Connor, the great evil mastermind behind everything, had her plans proceed to completion without any hitch at all. Now, having full control over the Vajra, it's pretty safe to say she holds much more power than anyone else currently, yet, of course, is defeated by the power of... music (Catchy j-pop music at that). A lot of build up was wasted in favor of going this predictable route, and it is basically the equivalent of beating the bad guy through the power of friendship. At the very least, they tried to give some basis for this being possible with information from earlier episodes explaining the power of music within the Macross universe. \\n\\n\r\nSeeing as this all happened in the span of a few episodes, it's safe to say that pacing became a huge issue, and solidified the fact that most of the other episodes were nothing more than \"filler\" and short arcs. They could have used this time to begin to develop the plot, but that wasn't the case. They may as well have cut out these episodes in favor of getting straight to the point, rather than extending the series unnecessarily. With the remaining episodes  not being devoted to plot advancement, some character development should  be expected in them, however, it's nowhere near as much as there should have been for how much time was devoted to this aspect. A majority of the remaining episodes used most of their time focused on the love triangle between the three main characters, but the events and developments that took place were usually undermined due to the indecisive and undeveloped protagonist of the series, Alto Saotome. He is also better known by some of the characters as Princess Alto, and for good reason. \\n\\n\r\nAnd while it may not all necessarily be because of him, he is directly involved in many of the simple plot conveniences used to keep the love triangle from moving forward. Whether it be going out to fight against the Vajra during a crucial time when he was supposed to be with Ranka, or Ranka seeing him with Sheryl and then wallowing in her own sadness about it afterwards.  However, with Alto being the resident princess of the series, it's not a far stretch to say he certainly can act like one at times. Ranging from his daddy issues leading to him running away from home to become a pilot, or how he likes to ignore any real problems that he faces, there's almost nothing about him that doesn't scream \"Princess\". He even has gorgeous flowing locks of hair to accentuate this. In fact, I have no doubt that some would start to question his manhood, as he practically ignores any advances from both Sheryl and Ranka, which goes back to him being largely at fault for the triangle never progressing. Any time it seems like he's made up his mind about who he wants to be with, the next episode has some bad news for you, as he basically does the equivalent of saying \"Just kidding!\", and begins to show what can be considered interest in the opposite girl. As for the whole \"Princess\" nickname and his daddy issues, they are touched on briefly, but it comes off as nothing more than the writers quickly throwing together some semblance of a back story so that they could pass him off as more than your average self-insert main character. \\n\\n\r\nHaving Alto bounce back and forth between who it seemed he was interested in clearly shows which characters are supposed to be the selling point of the series, and of course, I can only be talking about Ranka and Sheryl. Long winded fan boy name calling and debates aside for now, they both have their ups and downs as characters.\\n\\n\r\nRanka, who is easily the character who receives the most focus in the series, happens to be the one who receives the least development for all the time she spent on screen (Go figure). She manages to slowly get over her timid nature when it comes to singing, but only because of the encouragement Alto gives her throughout the series. Although this was good however, even with her having the most interaction with other characters and general screen time, she never developed a reason for singing past doing it for Alto's affection. Due to the fact that the time spent on her was poorly utilized, her development was hindered in the long run. This is made especially apparent when you see that a few of the side characters have more motivation for their actions than she does. For the sheer amount of focus the series gave her character, seeing them do nothing with it past the first few episodes was disappointing to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nSheryl, on the other hand, plays a much more interesting role in the series. Many pass her off as \"Bitchy\", \"Overly arrogant\" and many other demeaning terms from the moment she appears on screen, but she manages to easily become the best character in the cast. With her status established right from the beginning, it's not unfitting for her to act much like she runs the place. Providing a stark contrast from Ranka, Sheryl is confident and domineering to an extent, yet still caring of others, shown by her attitude towards Ranka and Alto. She eventually softens up a bit, mostly due to her feelings for Alto since he doesn't worship her like everyone else in the colonies. The struggle she goes through while falling from the top as Ranka took over is far more believable than anything Ranka or Alto went through. Having to cope with her fall from stardom, as well as her impending death due to a disease, she accepts these facts and still tries to move forward, doing the only thing she can do: sing. This made her far more endearing to the audience by the end of the series, as this shows her confidence wasn't simply based on her status as the Galactic Fairy, but her strength of will that was built up through living her old lifestyle of complete poverty. While she did remain mostly static, what she went through didn't feel contrived, much like the case was with Ranka. \\n\\n\r\nBut of course, like many other series, one of the biggest problems Macross Frontier presents is the ending. Again, I find myself questioning Alto's sexuality, as the ending provides zero closure for what is considered the main focus of the series: the love triangle between the three main characters. This is Macross, the plot is only there to help move the romance forward, and that's one thing Frontier severely failed at. Not only was Alto himself preventing it from taking a big step forward with his indecisiveness and constant character changes, the sheer amount of conveniences that kept the character's relationships from developing sure didn't help either. Like I mentioned, the filler episodes would mostly focus on the love triangle, but focusing on it is not the same as actually having it progress. Regardless of how much it actually progressed by the end, a conclusion is needed, and that's something the series never provided. While it was very heavily suggested that Sheryl \"won\" before the finale, the final moments of the series throw the entirety of the few episodes Alto was together with Sheryl right out the window, and has Ranka enter the competition once more. \\n\\n\r\nAs we all know, Alto has a major fascination for the sky, more so than for the two girls who fawned over him for the entire series. So what does he do? He doesn't clearly choose either girl, but instead chooses the mother fucking sky. Whether it was intentionally done this way so that the Sheryl and Ranka factions wouldn't destroy the world due to a simultaneous outburst of angry fan boys crying over the fact that their waifu \"lost\", or because they wanted to leave it up for interpretation, it doesn't change the fact that giving no closure severely impacts the series in a bad way. And when one of the main selling points of the Macross franchise is left untouched, it leaves nothing more than disappointment in the eyes of fans and newcomers alike. While making no decision on which girl the main character wants to be with may be a common occurrence in most harem series, it should not be the case when there is only a love triangle at hand. When ample time is given to devote to two characters and their interactions with the main character, going down this route is nothing more than a bad decision as it should be nearly impossible to get fans to feel satisfied with this kind of ending. It was a shame to see them use this kind of cheap exit strategy after putting forth the effort to develop the relationships in the series.  \\n\\n\r\nAfter all of this, there's nothing left but disappointment in the series. There may have been good j-pop, great action scenes, as well as throwbacks to previous entries in the franchise ranging from songs, to name drops and simple phrases, but that only adds to the enjoyment factor. And as most intelligent people will know, even that isn't enough to save a series which continually makes mistakes along the way. At the end of the day, Macross Frontier had a lot of potential, but unfortunately it was ruined by Alto who could not manage to keep the series flying smoothly.",

There's even a love triangle involved, which also insinuates itself very well to the action.Otherwise, there is nothing much different from the standard humans vs. aliens in a fight for survival kind of story that it really is.\\n\\n\r\nVariable Fighters are sexy, so sexy its criminal.  Yes they are the focal point of the show and yes, it deserves this praise.  Character design, on the other hand, could use a little less glowy hair.  In fact, Sheryl Nome looks like a woman who puts out, very very often because of it.  They must have forgotten that they left the dial at 11.  The setting and background are passable as well, no real blemishes and varied palettes make this one a winner.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I'm not a fan of pop music, but well it goes great with the anime, being centred around pop superstars anyway.  Yes, I will also admit to having acquired the Original Sound track, by Yoko Kanno et al., who is one of my favourite composers.  As I'm listening to it as I type this review, it does a fine job of standing alone and the chance remains high that I'll be leaving this on in the background as I do other things.  The sound effects on the other hand, aren't that spectacular, doing a good job, but that's about it.  Voice acting is well done, I can't say its bad.  The tones really bring out the nuances in a character, which I applaud.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, they are all well thought out.  A point made during the show even calls into question Alto's motivation for fighting and its in that exploration that makes Alto such a good character.  He really grows into his own and for once in a blue moon, does not have an emo moment as most child soldiers are want to do.  Not to be outdone, supporting characters are even fleshed out well, Mikhail to name one.  Cherish them, for you never know when they're going to be taken away from you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment?  Well, let's just say I thought this was like watching a better Top Gun, IN SPACE.  Awesome. This kind of makes me regret not having gotten in to Macross earlier.  WellI think I'll go acquire Super Dimension Fortress Macross now.  One last thing, Variable Fighters are not mecha, if you want to dispute that claim, please use my comments box.",

            "content": "As a guy who grew up on the original SDF Macross some 18 or so years ago, it isn't really a surprise that I would end up watching this show.  I was wondering when we would get a next Macross series. \r\nStory:\r\nA little disappointing that the story is moving at a snail's pace but it seems to be taking a much needed boost, after episode 9 threw a whole boatload of information at us.  Seems like Macross Galaxy (related to General Galaxy?) could be Frontier's Weyland-Yutani...?  Who knows, but it's starting to be a whole lot more interesting.  \r\nArt:\r\nMuch like SDFMacross, this series has some of the best and worst animation I have seen in a long time.  The backgrounds are amazing, the attention to detail is great, and the CG is generally extremely well done.  A real shame that the character animation at times can be really poor.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWhat I like about Macross is that the character development is much more subtle.  People have commented that Sheryl's behavior makes little sense.  Pay attention, it does make sense.  On the flipside, we haven't seen much from Alto which is a damn shame because he's the main lead.  Anyhow, it's nice that the show addresses Alto's feminine appearance.\\n\\n\r\nSide characters could use some work though.  Still, we're not even half way so I'm not worried yet.  \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIt's no Macross Plus, but it's generally been impressive.  The songs are catchy (she's the bloody Galactic Fairy...of course it's going to be *trashy* bubblegum pop) and some are nice in their own right such as Aimo and Diamond Crevasse.  The battle music was better in the other Macross shows, but it's hardly something to complain about when it's still pretty solid.     \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIt has been a long time since I've enjoyed the action so much.  The reuse of some animation is obvious, but generally it's nothing to worry too much about until we see the same VF-171 or tan-coloured VF-25 get blown up again and again.  Everything is fast, crisp, and well choreographed.  Helps too that the CG is pretty damn impressive.  \\n\\n\r\nToo long, didn't read?  Macross Frontier is not 'deep'.  Macross Frontier is not philosophical.  Macross Frontier is good old fun with a spark of quality to it.  I wouldn't have my Macross any other way.",

            "content": "Story: \r\nI tried to like the story but it opted for cheesy melodrama, bad action sequences and a love triangle that I did not care about. It tries to go for gut wrenching emotions but falls short because it does not bother to establish a conflict we truly care about, nor does it establish characters that I really cared about much at all.\r\nArt: \r\nThe art ranges from absolutely awful, to pretty good, sometimes varying wildly between episodes. One thing that I absolutely hated was the CGI dogfight scenes, the action and the choreography were well done, but the computer generated graphics felt clunky and outof place, and could have been replaced with hand drawn frames with more fluidity. \\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n The music and sound effects in this anime are absolutely wonderful. I am a major fan of Kanno Yoko's work, and the music here is her working masterfully. I loved both Sheryl's Techno arena hits and Ranka's ballads also the classical mood music is wonderful and it evokes the traditional feel of the Macross franchise.  \\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nTruthfully I can't stand most of the major characters, Sheryl is the only one that I like and that I feel plays out realistically.  Alto is a major jerk to everyone, and it's a wonder to me that he even has two love interests, thinking on how he treats them. Ranka is whiny and timid, except when she sings, we can see this play out throughout the the series, her character never changes from that mold. Sheryl at least is the only one that acts in a believable and likable way. She is confident and arrogant in a way you would expect a star of her caliber to be, yet she is not unkind and shows streaks of humor that I find to be very likable.\\n\r\nEnjoyment / Overall:\\n\r\nI enjoy Macross  Frontier mostly for its characters and the wonderful music. I keep hoping for interesting dramatic developments or good action scenes but I come away disappointed every episode. So it earns a mild recommendation on my part. \\n",

            "content": "Allow me to say: epic final battle was epic, spoilers abound, etc\r\nStory: Definitely interesting. In broad, it seems quite cliche (Aliens attack space colony, humans fight back), but if looked closer and given more detail, it's actually quite an intersting, but not totally original story. So far, it had focused a lot on developing the characters while throwing out the occasional dogfight and twist (Episode 13 = major twist), but it is laid out so it fits together well, and it's very interesting. Unfortunately, it suffers pretty bad pacing, which is very noticable towards the end, where they crammed tons of information and sudden revelations,resulting in information overload. I thought they could've lengthened it by a few more episodes to properly fit the whole story in, but wouldn't want the ruin the 25 theme (25th anniversary, 25 episodes, final episode aired September 25th, VF-25, etc). There are also many references to previous Macross titles, such as some Macross 7 songs and titles, Deculture, Macross Zero and the movie, pineapple salad, so it will appeal to the fans of the whole franchise.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I have to say, the CGI in Macross F is the best I've ever seen in an anime. Dogfights between the Macross Frontier Galaxy fleet and the Vajra are absolutely stunning, with flowing visuals and beautifully rendered variable fighters and Vajra. They certaintly didn't skimp on this area of animation, and it must have cost shitloads to make. Some people do complain that it feels &quot;out of place&quot; and prefer hand-drawn scenes. I myself think that this addition and mix of CGI and traditional drawn scenes is very innovative, and feels natural (Unlike GONZO LOL quality CGI) The CGI alone is enough to warrant a 10. However, the character art and animation are not so pleasing. Out of scenes using CGI, I would say that the animation is mediocre, and looks out of place compared to the near flawless CGI scenes. The characters are sometimes badly animated, and aren't drawn well. Ultimately, the mediocre character animations bring down the overall quality of the art to an 8.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I do know that Macross is renowned for its music, and Macross F does not disappoint in this area. The quality of the music is consistently high throughout the series, and it actually gets even better towards the end. The music is probably the best as it can get nowadays. They've managed to weave quite an amount of music into the anime without it sounding out of place or inappropriate, resulting in some kickass scenes, notably episode 7, where a massive dogfight took place with Sheryl singing Infinity at the same time. Aimo is also a very nice song, but was overused in the 2nd half. The best scene where the music truly shines the brightest is the final fight, where Sheryl and Ranka duke it out in a duet that lasted more than 8 minutes, and coupled with the epic final battle which was taking place at the same time. tl;dr: Music is nothing less than awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe VAs are also very good, especially Ranka's because she actually sings some of the songs, and she is a newcomer into the VA industry. Fantastic stuff.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Macross F has a wide plethora of characters, and the main characters are shown in the plot without overwhelming the numerous side characters. The characters are all very interesting, whether they be main characters or side, and so far there is lots of character development and interesting background information pertaining certain characters. The events portraying side characters are just as, if not more exciting than the main characters' event, and it's quite pleasing, as most animes and mangas focus too much on the central, main characters whilst leaving the side characters out. However, I disliked Alto, because he was extremely indecisive about his relationship with the two girls (Love Triangle), and it didn't feel right about how he was handling the situation. Hell, the side characters are actually more likeable and interesting than the main characters, like Bobby, he was just plain greatness as a GAR pilot for the Macross Quarter, and hilarious when not battling. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Macross F is a damn interesting anime, and it almost never fails to grab the interest of the viewers, especially during space fights, which don't occur often, but when they do, it is a huge dose of awesomeness. The music too is very enjoyable to listen to, and live performances with Sheryl in them are simply an excellent blend of above average character animation and fanservice. Fanservice is not uncommon in Macross F, and it is often used more for humour's sake than just showing body parts to the viewers. Which reminds me, the humour in Macross F is sometimes spontaneous, but when it is, it is generally very enjoyable. The music, and the mecha porn is what makes the series so fun to watch and springs forth the &quot;WHERE ARE MY MACROSS F SUBS FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUU-&quot; sort of attitude. The love triangle will probably frustrate you to no end, however, as it's not much fun watching Alto acting like a massive idiot when it comes to the two girls.\\n\\n\r\nMacross Frontier was a great anime, with great music, great artwork, and an interesting storyline, unfortunately marred by somewhat bad main characters interaction and bad pacing. It wasn't quite epic win as I earlier predicted, but the final battle was more than enough to redeem it. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a great watch for both fans of the previous Macross series and newcomers, and it will definitely catch your attention. I say go for it, if you haven't watched it yet.",

With a great story, the best sounds track i have ever heard, fantastic animation quality, great character design that i will never forget, I almost feel bad for those who have not gotten to enjoy the show yet. I need to comment on the music. If you're a macross fan you know that the show revolves around music and the power of song, and these tunes are rockin. With the second OP \"Lion\" or Sheryl Nomes Diamond Crevasse, The music keeps the flow of theshow going. \\n\\n\r\nThe Battles, fought in the depths of space are full of action and beautiful animation, they all have an electric flow, and are generally in sync with the Music, making all fights extremely engaging, both for your ears and your eyes.\\n\\n\r\nMacross frontier is so intense that the first episode, to me, felt more like a finale than a first episode. When macross quarter punched a certain opposing enemy IN THE FACE I had a shiver of win creep down my spine. \\n\\n\r\nOne point i would like to make. I dont like exagerating. I dont like lying. When I tell you now that macross frontier has the very best finale I have ever seen, I mean it. I have never seen a more satisfying end. Closure, new songs and mixes, a bit of a twist and the best space battle EVER.\\n\\n\r\nThough, I cant say ALL positives so i will say this. with the three main characters, alto, sheryl, and ranka, I feel that rankas character fell apart. It was at first a close love triangle, then as their story's progressed, they changed, but it seemed as though the writers were not sure what to do with ranka lee's  character at one point, and it kind of trailed off.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this show was GREAT, and even if you havnt seen another macross series, you can fully enjoy this one. I give this show a perfect 10, I was totally blown away. thank you for reading my review",

In every series i watched, i found the cast to be more or less really good, some characters i disliked strongly but not enough to trash the whole show; macross F manages to have the WORST cast out of every macross. Sheryl and Ranka are the saving grace of it, and Brera is also a good character, everyone else was either a blatant carbon copy of a past character (Cathy is obviously inspired by Misa and soon) or straight up unlikable. Alto is the worst macross protagonist ive met, his looks and background are so good but his personality? not so much. It\u2019s obvious from the very beginning of the series that he prefers Sheryl, and yet he keeps on being uncertain and misleading Ranka, who ends up with a broken heart each time. The treatment of female characters in this show is absolutely terrible, from Ranka and Sheryl who are used for the worst love triangle i\u2019ve ever seen, to girls like Cathy, Nanase, Klan, who did absolutely nothing except being used for fanservice and add to the amount of couples this show has. Klan was especially bad, the whole mess of having a different body when being micronized was absolutely disgusting, every other micronized zentradi is normal and then you have this girl who has either huge boobs or a childlike body depending on her size. Disgusting. Her romance with Michael was terrible as well, Michael always treated her like garbage and now before dying he confesses? Give me a break.\\n\r\nThe enemies weren\u2019t good either, Grace was the pinnacle of unlikable, the other guy was so irrelevant i dont even remember his name; all he did in this show is have sex with Cathy in one of the first episodes and thats about it.\\n\r\nLong story short: this show is shit. The music is fantastic but you can listen to it without watching this crappy anime.",

            "content": "I like campiness sometimes.  Macross and Robotech were campy but enjoyable.  Sure I never liked most of the main cast but there were elements that made me enjoy the series, both when I was a kid and later when I grew older.  \r\nProblem is, I haven't seen a Macross that's captured the same spirit as the originals except from possibly Macross Plus.  I never could understand this, it's not a difficult formula but it's never executed the same.\r\nLet's start with the premise: it's a love triangle story (coincidentally, the 1st opening theme is called \"Triangular\") where you the three main charactersare unlikable because of their glaring faults: Alto is a stubborn sissy that accidentally became a pilot from the circus (sound familiar?), Sheryl is a pompous star that can't express her true feelings but her pride just ruins her character, and Ranka who had the most potential was never fully explored throughout and thus you can't decide if you want to like her, much less care for her.\\n\\n\r\nI guess you could compare that to Hikaru/Minmei/Misa (Rick/Minmay/Lisa for the Robotech junkies) and Isamu/Guld/Myung thing too, yet you can actually feel bad for each character.  Macross F doesn't really let you do that, for 22 episodes (at least), the story flounders around everyday life while dabbling with the overlying plot.  Nothing really advances with any of the characters except some secrets that *eventually* get uncovered.  Problem is, sometimes those potentially plot-twisting secrets pop up, but then disappear for episodes until you kind of forget about it.  It's fine once or twice in a series, but when you pile layers upon layers of secrets to the point you don't even know what's most important, then you've lost the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThe Macross factor: the music.  I don't believe everything Yoko Kanno is necessarily gold and while I enjoy this soundtrack, it's not the best thing I've heard of in my life.  There's only about 3 songs I enjoy listening too, the rest...meh.  Nothing is really memorable that really sticks unfortunately, maybe it's because they introduce 28934239 tracks by both singers and constantly bombard you either with the same song over and over, or recurring songs layered with another new song.  It gets irritating.  You don't need a huge berth of new mediocre vocal tracks, stick with a couple solid songs and let it be that.\\n\\n\r\nThis series could have easily been knocked down to 13 episodes, took out a few characters and/or combined a few elements.  It's relatively predictable, feels like a lot of filler, characters aren't really all that likable, and the music is OK.  The series does go out with a great bang (the final song is incredible), but getting there was painful.  I wouldn't put it on par with Macross Plus, but definitely not the worst I've seen.",

            "content": "This is my first review, so hopefully I don't say anything to out of place. I've heard a lot about Macross from a lot of my classmates and I decided that I wanted to take a shot at it. I will say that I was not disappointed at all. \r\nStory 8/10\r\nThe story of Macross Frontier features colonies of people that are scattered around the galaxy in mega-sized domes similar to earth. The story overall wasn't completely original. Hostile Aliens threatening to exterminate the human race. Mecha units that are reminiscent to StarScream of the Transformer series. The thing that caught my eye was how musicplayed a huge factor in the series. Macross has always had a history of having music have a large impact and in this case, music was an integral part. At times, there were moments when the series would sometimes get a little corny, but it was tolerable with some great action scenes that came with it. In my opinion, Macross has never made Jets look so cool. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThe Art in Frontier is pretty good to stay the least. The visuals were excellent, and since I was able to find a website that had pretty good quality in it, I was able to enjoy it much more. There were a decent amount of scenes that had the characters emotions shown quite vividly. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nMacross has always been known for its music, and in this case it wasn't any different. The music was pretty catchy, especially the songs that were sung by Nakajima Megumi. I even downloaded one of the soundtracks. One of my favorite songs from her now is Seikan Hikou. The opening and ending songs were pretty catchy too which led me to enjoy the series even more. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nThis is probably the only drop off point for me. The main character Alto is a pretty generic character that has been featured in a whole lot of series. He may have a few bravado moments, but he its the fact that he is completely oblivious to the feelings of the female characters that frustrates me. The next main character Sheryl Nome/Norm is one of the two heroines and she is a little bit more decent. She hides her true feelings with strength and seeing flashbacks of her past shows some reasons why. Though as I have stated above, I am still unsure how she can fall for a character such as Alto. The final main character Ranza Mei is the only reason why Im rating the character portion a 7. She is adorable to say the least, and her personality fits her character a lot. Since she is deemed adorable, she is one of the most likeable characters in the series. Though she may fall off as the damsel in distress at times, she does have some moments where she shows that she even has her own moments of a \"fighting spirit\". \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nEven though the main cast may not have been perfect. I absolutely loved the fighting scenes. I even found it even more interesting how the much music was a large part of it which made me enjoy it anymore. Though Macross has been doing this for awhile, it has always been quite ambitious for them to have songs a part of an intense fighting scene. Some of the music that was a part of the fighting scenes were quite catchy as well which made the dog fights that much more enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nI was inclined to first give this a 8, but this is a series that I would definitely love to watch again. My only regret would be that I have not watched a whole lot of Macross and this is the first series that I have watched. I will probably watch the rest of the Macross Series in order to understand the universe much more. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "Where to start....So it's been essentially 4 years since the last Macross installment and a 12 year time skip since the prequel of this series: Macross Dynamite 7.\r\nStory: After the Deculture Special during Christmas in 2007, I was rather impressed with the series alone with just that one episode, especially with the introduction of another member of the Nome family.  However, it was almost obvious from not only the deculture episode, but the first few episodes of this series that it was going to turn into a love triangle series...a big no-no since it began to carry too much of the weight of theplot and we really didn't get much of a thorough development of the plot.  Results were almost like magic for the most part, especially with Sheryl's case in episode 25 when she is  magically cured from the V-Type Infection and no other explanation followed of how Ranka helped her.  To some extent, it almost came to the point of Gundam Seed Destiny, but I'm glad it didn't cross the line.  Had the series not wasted on a few episodes of love triangle, they could have gone far more in depth with the cases of the Vajra, Sheryl's past, and Ranka's past.  Character development was weak for this show, and had they used those episodes to emphasize on these, it would have aided in both the score of the story and character.  This is almost a failure in comparison with Macross Zero, but when compared to the prequel: Macross 7 and Dynamite 7, this is an epic piece of work.  \\n\r\nOnly two other factors are keeping this score up: 1) the announcement of a movie and 2) the tying together of most if not all the previous Macross series.  The upcoming movie gives hope to the series from just ending as if it were a waste of time by focusing on the love triangle.  Perhaps we will get something as tragic as the first Macross series or even Macross Zero with the movie?  Macross being notorious for sad moments of important and likeable characters (ie Lynn Minmay, Sara Nome, etc...) may bring this series around and thus raises confidence that this series is not out of steam yet despite the relatively decent ending to the TV series.  For the second factor, Macross fans will remember various bits and parts as well as the famous Lynn Minmay and Mao Nome who are showed and hinted at throughout many times during the series.  Macross Zero and the first Macross series were heavily emphasized in this series and that really helped put everything in place for Macross fans.  New viewers to the series may seem a bit confused as to some of the references and terminology, but the series does not completely alienate them as some explanation is provided making these viewers feel a bit more at ease.  8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: There's really nothing much to say here.  Although tv rips were bad and made animation look like it was deteriorating as episodes went by, especially episode 25, after checking this show out on DVD/Blu-ray, animation was nearly flawless.  You could almost see every bit of frame work involved in perfect the fight and concert scenes.  It was absolutely beautiful to watch and the best part is that there's no strain on the eyes when watching :D  Drawings were also a bit off at times, but that I'm sure will be fixed as more DVDs and Blu-Rays are released.  10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Does this really need to be commented on for this series?  When you bring Yoko Kanno into the picture, you might as well just give a 10/10 immediately.  She is the only anime music composer to have made top 3 in Oricon charts AFTER 1 WEEK of sales, and continues to remain as so with the addition of both Macross Frontier OSTs and soon a third OST this coming December.  Her first work to do so was End of Evangelion and ever since then, no other series or artists have done the same for an anime production.  In addition, the recruiting of May'n and Megumi Nakajima to sing as Sheryl Nome and Ranka Lee made it all the more better.  This is something to really look forward to if the movie in the making contains even more of Kanno, Nakajima, and May'n's masterpieces. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  As stated earlier, character development as overall relatively weak.  We got some insights on Sheryl's, Alto's, and Ranka's past, but it still feels lacking.  All we got were bits of flashbacks with no real detail.  The viewer is essentially being told to accept these things as if they did occur.  With nothing bridging the time skip as well as the many references to previous Macross series, it really does not bring out the actual identity of these characters.  One big example is  Brera...If he was blown to bits by the Vajra, how did he survive even revived as a cyborg?  Another is Mikhail/Michael; they made a huge deal out of his death in episode 20, and yet we didn't learn much about him except his deceased sister, which again we are suppose to take in as a fact with no further explanation.  The series just doesn't do very well bringing out what viewers want to know about the characters.  If anything, this series could have gone at least 30 episodes to really develop the characters and the love triangle rather than have wasted our time in 1997-98 with the 1 year, 49 episodes trash of Macross 7.  Those additional episodes could have been well spent here.  Length for this series would have been better if were around the length of the first Macross series: 36 episodes, which really brought out the meaning of Macross and its characters. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: All in all, this was a great watch.  I looked forward to this series every time it had aired.  The first couple episodes weren't great, but episode 7 onwards really hit the spot.  Episodes 7, 15, 20-25 really nailed the series for me and more of those kind of episodes were needed in this series.  Ranka was always enjoyable to watch and Sheryl always trying to act tough as well as her deeply emotional side was also great.  Alto was really just a wimp except the last two episodes where he really stood out a bit.  Ozma was badass and that really made numerous scenes even more enjoyable.  The characters themselves made the series enjoyable regardless of lack of development and the announcement of a movie after the final episode made it even more exciting. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Considering how I gave Code Geass R2 a 9/10, I would have to give this series a 10/10.  Why?  Because it was better than Geass R2.  Macross Frontier had been overshadowed by Geass R2 for more than half the air time, and what does Geass R2 do?  It gives us a crappy result...again Sunrise fails at sequels.  Geass R2 was the most anticipated series in Spring 2008 by most anime audiences and left Macross Frontier literally to rot.  By Summer 2008, both series seem to begin to get their acts together.  They were literally on par with each other, and from there, the curves go separate paths where Macross gets better and better with each episode while Geass R2 began to go down the drain.  R2, ended okay but only after 5-10 episodes of pain, a completely supernatural and unbelievable/uneasy plot, and train-wreck anticipations.  Macross Frontier on the other hand was relatively consistent to the end, holding a steady plot for the most part and giving at least a non-rushed ending, an awesome duet medley, and better yet the opportunity for further explanations for the series, or even a sequel!  Geass R2 on the other hand is now left in the dust with the cliffhanger ending of wondering whether or not  Lelouch is dead or not and something fans will never know.  Therefore, Macross Frontier deserves better than for not only its underdog status, but also its lack of attention.  10/10",

            "content": "(Warning: contains spoilers)\r\nMacross F (or Frontier) is extremely impressive, because I never thought an anime about idols singing teaming up with giant robots in space to save the world together could be THIS dull. It also puzzles me how people sing this so much praise, claiming it's the best Macross installment. Let me just make it clear that this is the first Macross I have watched; and yet, it was so bad it almost killed any desire I had of checking out the rest of the franchise.\r\nI'll try my best to keep it short, but let me break down what I think are some ofthe most critical points that made F a bad anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts following Alto Saotome, a pilot trainee, as he crosses paths with Sheryl Nome, a famous idol, and Ranka Lee, a regular girl who dreams of becoming one, as bug-like aliens known as the Vajra invade the Frontier. Alto is then scouted into the Military, getting caught up between his battle duty and his relationship with Sheryl and Ranka, who increasingly get more and more involved with the intergalactic battles as well. Sounds interesting, right? Well, keep yourself seated. From then on, things start to get complicated; characters are introduced left and right. Political conflict, cyborgs, biological diseases, tragic backstories and copious amounts of romance are thrown into the mix. Everything quickly becomes extremely convoluted: they are unable to properly develop and explain everything they want to show us. Thus, Macross F suffers with HUGE issues in pacing and tone, especially pacing - there were some occasions where I kept asking myself if I missed out on something, because things happened so quickly I couldn't keep up.\\n\\n\r\nWhen your main plot (and 60 subplots branching from it) is going this fast, of course it will crash. Things happened extremely suddenly, and with no foreshadowing whatesoever; we're just supposed to take at face value that Grace is the main antagonist, in a sudden reveal that makes it hard to take it seriously when nothing in the episodes leading up to this hinted on it. You're just supposed to accept that Mikhail's sister is dead, and that Sheryl was found rummaging through garbage and parentless (a huge plot inconsistency), and that Luca has a crush on Nanase. The reveal of the motive for Grace and the Vajra is so stupid I couldn't contain my laughter. And with all that, the big, emotional moments such as character deaths and tearful goodbyes are extremely hard to care about. Why should I when you squashed your reasons into a single one minute long scene instead of developing the characters properly throughout the show? And there is also the big bad of the entire thing: the love triangle, and the other smaller romances. A love triangle between Alto, Sheryl and Ranka was EXTREMELY unnecessary. I cannot stress enough how unnecessary it was, and how much it empoverished the show. There's no need to measure words: it was garbage. Alto treated both girls really badly (I'll expand on this later) and the girls would often commit acts of love for him, and feel motivated to do things for him, when they don't give them a single reason. Not to mention that, in the end, after all that kissing and crying and touching, Alto doesn't even end up with either one. If you're going to write in a shitty love triangle into your setting about giant robots, at least compromise and give it a proper resolution instead of this cowardly, open ending bullshit. There's also a lot of dumb ass things that made no sense I could point out (like Ranka becoming famous overnight on the same beat as Sheryl falls out of stardom to the point people wouldn't recognize her on the street), but if I were to list them all I'd be here all week - there were just too many. To finalize, the battle scenes, which should be the highest point of F, put me to sleep. They are messy, full of the characters spouting bullshit technical terms and plot exposition that often made little sense, and I found myself completely uninterested in anything going on, even visually.\\n\\n\r\nBut well, as if all of this wasn't enough, the characters were even worse. Yes, I am sorry to say, they were so poorly written it was horrifying. Starting with Alto, our protagonist: I don't know what went so wrong here. Maybe they were aiming to make him a tsundere or just broody, but what they came out with was an asshole. Don't be fooled by descriptions saying Alto is \"a normal high schooler\" or \"just a little broody\". Alto is unlikeable from the get-go: he's always disproportionately angry at any and everything for absolutely no reason. He is always yelling at his own friends. And he is always treating the two girls who are in love with him like hot garbage -  ESPECIALLY Ranka. It was painful and infuriating to see him make disgusted faces at Ranka and ignore her texts and calls, acting like she was a hassle but still leading her on while she was clearly in love with him. He was also overly aggressive with Sheryl, going as far as screaming at her about her lack of professionalism because she got sick while the girl is bedridden, so ill that she can't get up or move. Then he had random moments of tenderness where he acted nice to them, even though minutes prior he was being the biggest prick in the world, only to return to his default asshole state later. That's because his personality is about as consistent as a pile of diarrhea. He undergoes no real character development, which, well, guess it's fair since his entire character is so intolerable and inconsistent to begin with that I don't see any salvation. He had an interesting background as a Kabuki actor, but they barely explored it - and when they did, it was in the dumbest ways you can imagine, namely jokes about him being a \"princess\" and his brother trying to convince him to quit battling and going back to acting AS THE PLANET WAS ON THE VERGE OF BEING DESTROYED. Oh yeah, they also tried to explain the fact that he acts like a wolf with rabies with him having a dead mom. When this is the main character of your story, you're already starting off on the wrong footing.\\n\\n\r\nThe other two main characters are Sheryl and Ranka, who, like beaming hope at the end of a tunnel, are surprisingly both likeable and reasonably consistent. Ranka gets more relevance and a bigger role in the story; she is a bright, cheerful and kind young girl with a love of singing and a dream of becoming an idol, who later uses her voice to help fighting off the Vajra. Her lighthearted optimism sometimes almost made me forgot how annoying everything else was. But unfortunately, Ranka gets treated horribly by her own narrative; between her family trauma, Alto being an absolute bitch, both the heroes and the villains using her for her magic voice, and even brainwashing, she doesn't seem to catch a break. Most of her motivation centers around Alto as well, which is absolute bonkers when she has two older brothers and friends who both care for and encourage her more than Alto ever did in his entire sorry life; ultimately, Ranka also gets very little development, only becoming very slightly less childish by the end. Sheryl, on the other hand, is headstrong, confident and a little arrogant, if anything - not without reason - with a friendlier side to her. She's extremely fun to watch and she owns the show whenever she's on the screen. But, once again, unfortunately, her character development is poorly handled. Instead of teaching her how to be more humble and caring of others, the narrative punishes her for her confidence with a terminal illness. The idea is that she is at her best when she's depressed and dying, rather than thriving on her career and aware of her own talent and presence. And again, the love triangle butts in to make things worse, where Sheryl acts oddly ooc when she's around Alto. Sheryl and Ranka's friendship has so much lost potential, too. The very few scenes they have together are very sweet, but they all end with Alto showing up to ruin everything. Sometimes they were weirdly, vaguely hostile to each other, because I guess they absolutely have to since they like the same guy. Go figure.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast... I don't even know if I should expand on them and make this review even longer than it already is. Let me just say they are bad, cookie cutter archetypes, and that I wish writers knew that they don't HAVE to pair up every single character with each other in forced, nonsense, dogshit romances. Every time Mikhail and Klan were onscreen with their bullshit I felt like barfing. Desk Man, Sugita Man, whatever is his name because I quite frankly don't remember or care, was the most boring villain I've ever seen and so ugly he hurt my eyes. Brera and Ozma were alright, as they at least they were consistent and nice to Ranka unlike everyone else in this show. In short, all you need to know is that none of them are particularly remarkable. Or interesting. Or well written. Or even good looking (Mikhail is really ugly, sorry to note. Who designed this?). What is with mecha anime with school settings and adding dozens of uninteresting, underdeveloped stereotyped characters and expecting us to care about them all? I've sat through this with Valvrave and Code Geass and it's disappointing to see the pattern repeated in Frontier.\\n\\n\r\nAt least I can say ONE nice thing about all this, which is: the music is certainly amazing. I'm listening to Diamond Cravasse while I write this review, and Sheryl's vocals are like velvet - whereas Ranka's silky voice works perfectly on their duets, so props for that. I really wish the music was more important than the strange science and spaceships in the plot itself, but it's more of a decoration/thematic background. As for its visuals, maybe they were impressive back in 2008, but it just didn't age too well. The art looks pretty off and there's a bunch of animation blunders. And like I mentioned before, save for a select few, the character designs were offensive to the eye; Klan literally looks like she walked out of porn (what was with her wide eyed blushing every other minute), Cathy and her friends look really boring, Luca has nothing of note besides looking 10 years old and Mikhail is just God's mistake.\\n\\n\r\nSummarizing all of it, Macross F maybe even had potential. A lot of its ideas were interesting and could have been amazing if properly developed and expanded on. But instead they went on the bland romance, misplaced fanservice and trainwreck route. That's a crying shame. I'll just move on to Macross Plus now and try to forget I ever watched this.",

Jaw-droping CG?\r\nIf you answered yes to 2 or more of the above then you'll find Macross Frontier and anime worth your time and heck it might even end up being on your top favorite animes.\r\n[story]:\r\nTo start the story itself does a pretty good job to start by explaining everything that has happened to mankind in this version of reality, so I much give this anime props for not being one that simply throws its viewers into a sea of information and drama for us to sort out ourselves.\r\nTo put it simply the story revolves around a galaxy-known singer named\"Sheryl Nome\" who has come to be also known as the \"Galactic Fairy\", a pilot named \"Alto Saotome\" who left his prestigious family of actors and he's also known as \"Princess\" due to his long hair and the fact that he played such an excellent role as a princess in a past play, and finally there is the rising star \"Ranka Lee\" who through the help and encouragement from Sheryl and Alto is able to reach goals she once thought impossible for her.\\n\\n\r\nThis group of three then coincidentally meet up on a space colony known as \"The Frontier\" and soon become friends, obviously. Through this friendship the story continues to progress as a new threat to mankind appears in the form of the \"Vajra.\" The \"Vajra\" are insect-mech like creatures that appeared out of the blue and have the potential to bring man to the brink of extinction once again, but will our three heroes  be able to do anything before mankind becomes another distant memory in the vast universe?\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Art:]\\n\r\nI'm pretty sure that if you already watched this anime then I don't need to cover this part of the review since if anyone who watched this show would know that the CG animated battles scenes are easily one the biggest highlights of the show, with the other being the soundtrack but I'll go into more detail about the Soundtrack later in the review. \\n\\n\r\nI must also bring up that not only was the CG animation fluid and brilliantly done but the mechanical and overall art designs of the anime were excellent, so you get 2 thumbs up from me Design Staff d(0w0)b\\n\r\nI mean seriously when I was watching this I felt like Macross Frontier was causing me Eye Orgasms, which may explain why I couldn't take my eyes off the screen XP \\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I had with the animation was the repeated use of specific scenes in the space battles with the Vajra. Closer to the end of the series I noticed an increase use of past scenes such as when one specific Vajra would spin and launch its missiles, please excuse my vague description. \\n\r\nHopefully I'm not the only one that noticed this, but other than that the animation was basically flawless ;D\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]:\\n\r\nThis anime isn't also known as a Space Opera for nothing. It has got epic battle scenes and emotional music to accompany it, so who wouldn't love this soundtrack. In fact, I recommend that you go and find the soundtrack and listen to a few of your favorite songs because some of them are just that good.\\n\r\nI'd also like to give a big around of applause for Megumi Nakajima and May Nakabayashi for their exquisite vocal performances as  Ranka Lee and Sheryl Nome.\\n\r\nLet us not forget about the one that brought them all together and produced these masterful works of music for our ears, Masafumi Mima.\\n\\n\r\nThe only con that I could possibly find in the Sound department of this anime would be the tad bit overuse of certain songs such as \"Aimo.\" I understand that the song \"Aimo\" plays an important role in overall story but I quite confident that I'm not the only one who thinks it was being used a bit too much. Hey don't get me wrong I seriously love the song \"Aimo\" heck it's one of my favorite musical pieces in this whole anime what I'm just trying to say is that some of the soundtrack would be been better enjoyed if they weren't sung so often throughout the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Character]:\\n\r\nThis is one of those animes that thanks to it having a longer run-time (more episodes), it was able to establish a close bond between the audience and the characters. Which is usually the main fault in nearly any anime I've watch these days.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part this anime will allow you to grow closer to the characters but maybe not as much as other animes or make you as depressed... *cough* \"Clannad\" *cough*\\n\\n\r\nOverall you'll be able to come to understand Sheryl Nome as someone who is not arrogant diva but someone who has, through her own will, climbed the ladder to the top. We'll also learn of the latent potential and strength of Ranka Lee and her powerful voice. Finally we will bear witness to our main male protagonist, Alto Saotome, grow from naive boy who seeks only his dream to fly through an endless sky to someone who learns what he needs to protect and fight for, but most importantly that though reaching one's dreams brings satisfaction, reaching one's dreams with the ones you love is that much sweeter.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]:\\n\r\nThrough and through I enjoyed this anime greatly, but maybe not to the point of it making it to my list of favorites unfortunately. However, I will say that this anime does deserve the spot for my favorite anime OST since who wouldn't find a song or 2 they like in an anime that has like what 49 songs in its soundtrack? xD\\n\\n\r\nOh and don't get me started with the eye-gasmic CG animation and designs!! I mean WOW I haven't seen that level of visual beauty since I saw something like \"Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children\" or maybe even the \"Mona Lisa?\" xD\\n\\n\r\nI just loved everything about this anime and though it wasn't perfect it had just so much going for it that I could actually ignore the faults it had.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I will definitely recommend this anime for anyone who answered yes to most of the questions I posted at the beginning of this review. \\n\r\nOr even to those who just want to watch something fun and action packed since Macross Frontier definitely fits that bill.",

            "content": "OK so heres my first review, i'd like to set straight that Frontier is the only Macross series ive watched so i have nothing to compare it with.\r\nStory - I loved the story here, just when you think you've sussed where its going it twists some more.  Also not too much time was focused on backstory but enough for me to understand the setting without watching the previous Macrosses.\r\nArt - The artwork and animation was incredible, i was actually recomended this anime on the basis of the artwork and I have to agree with the guy, HD is well worth it here. For anyonewho loves the style of Shinkai Makoto this is definately for you.\\n\\n\r\nSound - The soundtrack is a tricky one for me.  The J-pop undoubtedly deserves a 10/10 if only for the fact that they've completely changed my attitude towards J-pop.  However the instrumental themes are lacking somewhat and seem to have heavily influenced in places by \"Pirates of the Carribean\", as in there were moments when it becomes undiscernable.  Fortunately these are minimal in the series but if youre looking to download the soundtrack be sure to search out the \"Nyan Tama Vocal Collection\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Each character in this is beautifully fleshed out, not just the main characters but the supporting ones aswell. But also the relationships between characters are so well thought out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - this anime successfully joins action, mecha, romance and comedy.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout and really gives you chance to empathise with the characters. Whats not to love?\\n\\n\r\nI really would recommend this to everyone and anyone so if your plan to watch list isnt to clogged up you should definately throw this on there!",

            "content": "I'm not really into mecha oriented type animes. But this one, as it's predecesors, has love-drama and some others elements that are taken to such a high level of importance and just become essential in the development and coclusion of the anime itself. I think that this is what makes it different from almost any other mecha-type animes.  \r\nThe story starts up strong, full of mysteries and incognits but as it develops it downfalls a bit and concludes poorly at the end. The theme is the same as the other Macross series in the saga, In a galaxy far away in the future. Butthis time the Macross Convoy faces a new enemy: the Vajra, bug like robots that are surrounded by secrecy and darkness. The good thing about the story is the love-triangle development, I really enjoyed the moments that Ranka-Sheryl and Alto spent together but, again, the way they end it up is really mediocre, so it starts really promising but it ends with no as it's started. Also the story has MANY musical events, scenes that are full of live performances or battles combined with music, being the two female lead characters musicians. So expect a lot of interruptions during the story, but don't worry the music is so good that you won't be bothered at all by this. Expect as well numerous references to older Macross animes in some episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and design are just beautiful. The characters look colourful and really movie-style. The space battles look amazing, the action sequences and fights are really entertaining to watch. The world inside the Macross Convoy is just amazing: some parts of it look like San Francisco and others like China, so we've got a lot of variety here, really pleasant to watch. Other stuff to note are the gadgets like the cellphones that are crucial for the love-romance part of the story.Also I found the design of this cellphones quite amusing and funny as well as innovative, they go on par with the rest of the theme perfectly. The design of the females characters blew me away. Ranka looks amazing with her green hair and pretty red eyes and Sheryl just looks so hot with her unique color of hair and the sexy and revealing different oufits she wears during her live performances, definitely eyedrops for the eyes. The only thing I found to be out of place about the artistic part of this anime is the exagerated similarities between the Valkyries (mechas). I mean, one has a sniper riffle and other doesn't and then one is gray colored and the other one blue and... that's it! I really feel that the producers could have done a better job (having the mecha battles a important role in this anime) in putting sort of a spark to each mecha, something that REALLY made one different from another. Other than this, the animation feels taken off a next generation show; the animation quality suggest that Macross Frontier is a movie of some sort, a very high budget movie.\\n\\n\r\nGod the sound. What can I say here? The opening and ending singles are still on the top in Japan charts I think so? Well everything is just perfect about the sound being this a music-conflict resolution anime. The songs in this anime are all just performed for the sake of it and are genius, both in quality and lyrics. There is actually a song from a older Macross \"Watashi no Kare wa Pilot\" that is interpreted in this newer Macross. But putting aside this song the other ones are all new and made exclusively for the series. The sound is definitely the most outstanding aspect of this anime, the music is everywhere, in the love scenes, in the battles sequences, or even in the streets overview! Normally it would be annoying but the music is just that good that it does make up for it. Also the BMG's are adequate for each ocassion and make one feel a stronger impact depending the situation the story is going through.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very well done in looks and personality. Love Ranka's personality and love Sheryl's Looks XD! The development is another matter that needs pointing out. The main male character Saotome Alto just progresses well as the story advances and goes from a simple high schooler to a SMS-Skull Squadron Pilot. The other characters like Ranka and Sheryl have a good development as well: Sheryl goes downfall, being a famous artist at the begining and finishing being opacated by Ranka who goes from singing for fun and in the streets to finally became a famous pop idol and the savior of the Galaxy. But characters like Michael and Lucca just appear out of nowhere and are from the begining members of the SMS, just like that. I found this a bit weird. They are taken into account half way trough and almost when the story reaches it's climax which proves they are vital, at last.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I truly enjoyed this anime from the begining 'till episode 24. The episode 25 wasn't as satisfying and concluding as I expected but it definitely thrilled me enough at the end. I really recommend this anime if you are looking for something really impressive to listen or to watch and you don't care how, to such a extend, a good story can be spoiled at the end, then this should be your first choice because, even if are are not a mecha fan, this anime will be one for you to remember and rewatch on several occassions.",

There, you got ahint of what is about the anime.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about the caracters, Alto is the kind guy you will found in most of the anime, a basic. Sheryl is the girl who will never admit how she feel, and is kinda annoying in the start of the anime, but Ranka is the one outstanding, working hard to get what she want, and make you smile trough her cutness.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation of Macross Frontier are really amazing, even if I didn't watch it in the best quality.\\n\\n\r\nNow the best part, the musics...\\n\r\nHow should I put it, I simply love May'n and Megumi's both voices, you often hear them sing, especially when Alto is fighting, and somehow, it really fits good in the fights.\\n\r\nThe more you advance in the episodes, the more the singing is good, wich makes the finals episode really wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nWell, in the all, it's an anime I really recommend, the story is a classic one who always works, the visual art is impressive, and if you like May'n and Megumi's voices, your ears will burst of pleasure. \\n",

            "content": "~My second review~\r\nHello, everyone! Today I am going to throw out the review on Macross Frontier!\r\nThis anime from the get-go brings much nostalgia from (Original) Macross, Macross Zero and Macross 7.\r\nIf you question the validity of this review you are welcome to do so. I have NOT watched the Macross (original series) but I have watched the movie. I HAVE watched all of the Robotech series and the Macross (Do you remember love Movie)\r\nSo on that context, let me start my review.\r\nAs I stated earlier, there are many points that I found from both the Macross movie and Macross 7. I personally enjoy all ofMacross becuase it centers around culture and music. \\n\\n\r\nThe story from the beginning is powerful and runs along with the memories and traditions of what makes Macross great.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is definately first rate along with the much flashes and absoultely wonderful aircraft flight/fight scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound. Oh my. Just like my previous review on Hikaru No Go, the music in this anime just drew me in instantly when I heard it. Again, this is another anime that just speaks volumes of \"right music at the right time.\" The entire soundtrack absolutely flows. (Not to mention how traditonal it is having music from previous Macross series.) Of course w/ Yoko Kanno at the helm of the soundtrack, it is absolutely grand.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is on one hand interesting and on the other hand inspiring. In these 25 episodes of Macross Frontier they definately try to fart out as much to get you feeling personally with each of these characters and want to hold onto their struggles. And in additon ask why things are going the way they are.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It was a great series if you like seeing things blow up, and want to reminisce about Macross. It's quality is top notch  and it is definitely an anime that I think is worth watching more than once.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nWith great plot, story, character development and an overall wonderful feeling behind it, this anime is for you. If you dislike aircraft, a little bit of drama, and a anime that has a wonderful sense of purpose this anime is most likely not for you.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this review, this was really hard to write w/out spoiling anything.",

            "content": "*A Stunning Revival of a 25 Years Old Series.*\r\n\"Simple, easy to comprehend plot. Skillfully developed love triangle. Masterpiece level animation and music.\"\r\nTo those who are new to the Macross franchise, you can find some info on it here. Now first to clarify a thing for those who are confused with the \"Macross Frontier Deculture Edition\". The difference is simply that the Deculture Edition is the \"pilot episode\" of the TV series. Another way of putting it is an OVA version of episode 1 of the TV series which was aired ~3 months later.\r\nTaking place 47 years (story-wise) after the original series, Super Dimension Fortress Macross.We are now in the year 2059 AD. The Space War with the Zentradi was long since over and the new migration fleet, Macross Frontier, is now under attack by a new alien race. The story revolves around a love triangle and how the three cope with each other while dealing with the threats from the aliens.\\n\\n\r\nThe battle animations are absolutely STUNNING. Fluid CG battle animations to very detailed character outlook are very much the highly for the show. One can even tell that the background for most scenery were well thought out and well designed. Oh, and very consistent quality of animation. \\n\\n\r\n\"1st Anime Album in 11 Years to Rank in Japan's Top 3\"\\n\\n\r\n\"Two Macross Frontier Singles in Japan's Weekly Top 10\"\\n\\n\r\n\"All four of the Macross Frontier singles that have been released have debuted at #5 or higher.\"\\n\\n\r\nHow does that sound for starter? The Macross series were largely famous for its music as they all played an integral part in every single Macross title. However, one can say Macross Frontier have taken the anime song industry to a whole new golden era! Both the singer and seiyu responsible for singing the second OP won awards for their fabulous works.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of characters developments happened in the latter half of the series making it a bit boring to watching in the beginning (as far as characters are concerned). However this is balanced by Sheryl Nome's character development which was extremely well done especially toward to the end of the series.We also be Alto and Ranka mature over time (albeit very late in the series).\\n\\n\r\nThe series as a whole was very well made with amazing sound effects and graphic. The love triangle between the 3 protagonists was interesting to watch as well. It was painful to see the show end, but at least it was announced that a movie is underway.\\n\\n\\n\r\n*Update on February 10, 2009*\\n\r\nIf you liked Macross Frontier, you may be happy to know that it was voted by anime fans a week ago as THE anime of 2008. In addtion, May'n (Sheryl's singing VA) also got voted as one of the top anime singer.",

            "content": "Macross Frontier isn\u2019t merely another sci-fi space opera.  Despite incorporating just about every anime clich\u00e9 in the book\u2014from school drama to mecha to moe to the love triangles that are the Macross franchise\u2019s signature\u2014Macross Frontier manages to create something that is simultaneously the maximum fulfillment of its genre\u2019s capacity and also the complete and utter subversion of its viewer\u2019s expectations.  It\u2019s been hailed as the SDF-Macross of the 21st Century, and there\u2019s no doubt about that; even for viewers unfamiliar with the original Macross series, Macross Frontier bridges nearly every gap imaginable to create something that will undoubtedly stand the test of timeas its original predecessor has.\\n\\n\r\nThe directing is superb, though I cannot say with much conviction that it\u2019s entirely noteworthy.  The signature tracking shots of dog-fighters have been given extraordinary retrofits with wonderful CGI integration, and immediately call to any Macross fan\u2019s mind the meticulously drawn epic battles of the original series and its companion film, yet they still manage to remain largely unique.  This lies in the masterful art direction and consistently top-notch quality found throughout the whole series, giving the impression of absolute relevancy yet remaining \u201cMacross\u201d enough to justify just enough nostalgia to appeal to any fan.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is easily one of the series\u2019 highlights (though it shouldn\u2019t be said that it is its best feature, considering how utterly well-done the series as a whole is).  Yoko Kanno provides the perfect musical accompaniment to the lovely vocals of Megumi Nakajima and May Nakabayashi.  The climax of the whole show provides one of the most interesting medley collages of music I\u2019ve ever encountered, and pretty much reestablishes (or at least adds credence to) Yoko Kanno\u2019s position as one of the greatest soundtrack composers of all time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s the narrative.  This is a show that takes everything the last decade\u2019s anime had to offer, rolls it up into a single coherent narrative, and manages to not only pull off a great story, but actually USE these tropes, clich\u00e9s, and techniques as something more than they\u2019re usually intended.  Its surface-level plot is utterly brilliant in its simplicity, as it allows the deeper aspects of its meta-themes to shine through\u2014particularly its rather odd-yet-genius juxtaposition of moe, school drama, and slice-of-life with mecha, space opera, sci-fi, and action of apocalyptic scope.  While this may not be entirely new to the genre\u2014nor even to the Macross franchise, seeing as how SDF-Macross did something along these lines on its own\u2014it should be noted that Macross Frontier raises the bar with its ability to pull these ideas (and more) into a cohesive narrative structure.\\n\\n\r\nIts seemingly simplistic plot allows for character development in leaps and bounds, to the point that just about every character in the series is fleshed out enough to be a well-rounded and three-dimensional device.  Despite this, Macross Frontier remains a heavily plot-driven show, as much of the conflict created between the characters\u2014masterfully handled as it is\u2014remains largely unresolved through interactions and relies on plot-driven consequences in order to keep the whole narrative flowing.  At times this peeks through as a detriment, but for the most part the show manages to balance itself out.  To its credit, it never fully lapses into ungrounded melodrama and angst in order to illustrate character interaction, and seems to be acutely aware of the fine line between well-executed drama and baseless moaning.  In compensation for its shortcomings with overall character drive, the plot takes advantage of allegory and an abundant use of vague foreshadowing to create an ever-shifting storyline that never really has a chance to congeal into a set routine.  \\n\\n\r\nThis is a series that will have you grinning madly with anticipation, overwhelmed with the intensity of the action, and feeling the impact of rejection, doubt, and loss.  It\u2019s a fantastic introduction to the Macross franchise, and it\u2019s the perfect successor to the Macross name.  Recommended to any fan of anime.",

            "content": "Macross Frontier, the latest installment to the 25-year-old mecha franchise, is so promising in every aspect early on that once the flaws become more apparent and begin to hinder to the series, it still remains watchable. But despite the rough patches the series hits, it is ultimately a very worthwhile watch.\r\nOne of Frontier's most endearing aspects is that it carries the Macross mythos while never alienating new audiences. Bringing with it all the cliches and plot devices that relegate the Macross universe, Frontier tells an solid stand-alone story that still connects well with the previous series before it. Frontier also succeeds in carrying as manytwists as red herrings. This is bound to keep the audience on their feet and doubting any obvious plot twist. Viewers may be disappointed later on though, when some plot twists turn out just like they predicted.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Frontier is one of those red herrings. From the start, the characters are fresh, lively and interesting, but it's all a lie because about a quarter of the way through, they all turn into relegated one-dimensional personas and some, like the sad case of main character Alto, stay that way the entire series. Frontier also suffers character-wise from a large starting cast. Many members of the cast will often be unseen for several episodes because so much time is rightfully demanded of Ranka and Sheryl. Because of this, the series does not properly develop anyone's character, outside an episode dedicated to a single character.\\n\\n\r\nComparing Frontier to it's primary ancestor is a dramatic change in animation. Frontier makes full use of CG for concert scenes and battle scenes, and does so without giving the series a tacky feel. Everything looks fluid and detailed, but the series has a penchant for being too detailed in which so much goes on in a single frame that it's hard to follow, though its arguable if that's a flaw or not given the psychedelic feel of the concert scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThough Yoko Kanno's OST is not one of her better works, the sound spotlight falls heavily on newcomers Megumi Nakajima and May'n, who lend their singing talents to Ranka and Sheryl respectively, giving us a jukebox's worth of catchy tunes each with their own distinctive style. From the viral Deculture jingle to the solemn &quot;Diamond Crevasse&quot; to the surrealistic bubblegum pop of &quot;What 'Bout My Star&quot;, there's more than enough here to keep your ears happy the whole series length.\\n\\n\r\nMacross Frontier was a series whose characters irritated the bejeezus out of me, but with a solid story, beautiful animation, and steller music, I could tolerate them enough to end this series with a smile on my face. If you're unfamiliar with the lengthly Macross franchise, this latest installment to the mythos has enough great elements to sell you on checking out the rest for sure. I know it has for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Macross Frontier an 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "Being the most anticipated anime of the spring season 08, I am NOT a bit surprised that MF turned out to be the most disappointing one. Except the incredible CG-implemented starwar-like battle scenes, there is nothing else to it, absolutely nothing. Even the music is average. The plot and the characterization are terrible too...Wait a minute, what am I talking about? There is no plot and characterization in this show. I can summarize the plot of the first eight episodes I watched into one sentence: two girls whoring around one guy plus some random battles against aliens. I'm sorry if I offended the fans butthat's how it seems to me.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is the horrible characterization. None of the characters serve any purposes nor add anything to the show. Alto is OK but he doesn't have any strong points that can make the audiences remember him. He is just a very normal very boring very bland character. The other ones are even worse. I don't know what the writers were thinking when they created Sheryl. She was first introduced as a bi...a very mean lady (ep1). Then the writer suddently decided to drop this side of her and switched her into someone who looks out for Ranka. In recent episodes she changed her personality again and apparently became jealous of Ranka for no reasons(ep6). There is not even transitions between these changes. What a messed-up character development this is. Lastly Ranka, well, I think she is only there to attract fanboys. I absolute don't see any personality in her.\\n\\n\r\nI'm starting to get a little disappointed about these new animes. None of them is even close to the ones like Eureka Seven or Ayakashi. As a matter of fact, this Macross Frontier makes Gundam Seed look like a masterpiece, and I think Seed only deserves a 7/10 at most. And may I remind you that MF is the most anticipated series of the season? I think you get my point.",

            "content": "--- Warning: Contains spoilers ---\r\nMost series can be summed up in a few words, and regardless of their implications, some descriptions may throw you for a loop. When you hear the words triangles, music, missiles, more music and even more missiles, what is it that you think of? Most well-versed anime viewers should be thinking of the Macross franchise, as this can effectively sum up a great portion of what it's all about, ranging from the original series to the latest installment entitled Frontier.\r\nMacross Frontier happens to be a fairly ordinary anime that in its simplicity, loses  direction as it progresses, only to attemptto get back on track after wasting lots of time. When you break it down, at least half of the episodes are fillers, and a majority of the rest are short arcs that don't really connect  and flow together to form a solid plot like any good series would. Since this is not an episodic series,  this format begins to hurt itself in the long run, as only little bits of crucial information about the grand scheme of things are revealed throughout the series.  This makes the progression of the main plot very slow and unnecessarily dragged out. It's not until the final third of the series that it decides to focus on what can be considered the main plot. Up until this point, the plot was nothing more than a simple \"Defend the human race from unknown aliens\", which is already weak in and of itself as it's really just a poor excuse for some mecha action, but it decided to take a sharp 180 and go down the oh so wonderful conspiracy route. \\n\\n\r\nWith this development that couldn't help but be expected many episodes  prior, everything starts to become a giant mess. This was hinted to a few times throughout the beginning of the series, usually only for a very short time period in select episodes displaying things like undercover discussions or trades, so it's not like it came on unforeseen by the audience. If anything, it happened far too late, as the motives behind Grace and Leon who were originally working together are hardly delved into, and they simply play the bad-guy role because the series needed a better antagonist than random aliens. Both individuals having very grandiose goals of wanting to rule the universe, you can't help but wonder how they actually planned on executing this in the first place. It is only explained after Grace O'Connor, the great evil mastermind behind everything, had her plans proceed to completion without any hitch at all. Now, having full control over the Vajra, it's pretty safe to say she holds much more power than anyone else currently, yet, of course, is defeated by the power of... music (Catchy j-pop music at that). A lot of build up was wasted in favor of going this predictable route, and it is basically the equivalent of beating the bad guy through the power of friendship. At the very least, they tried to give some basis for this being possible with information from earlier episodes explaining the power of music within the Macross universe. \\n\\n\r\nSeeing as this all happened in the span of a few episodes, it's safe to say that pacing became a huge issue, and solidified the fact that most of the other episodes were nothing more than \"filler\" and short arcs. They could have used this time to begin to develop the plot, but that wasn't the case. They may as well have cut out these episodes in favor of getting straight to the point, rather than extending the series unnecessarily. With the remaining episodes  not being devoted to plot advancement, some character development should  be expected in them, however, it's nowhere near as much as there should have been for how much time was devoted to this aspect. A majority of the remaining episodes used most of their time focused on the love triangle between the three main characters, but the events and developments that took place were usually undermined due to the indecisive and undeveloped protagonist of the series, Alto Saotome. He is also better known by some of the characters as Princess Alto, and for good reason. \\n\\n\r\nAnd while it may not all necessarily be because of him, he is directly involved in many of the simple plot conveniences used to keep the love triangle from moving forward. Whether it be going out to fight against the Vajra during a crucial time when he was supposed to be with Ranka, or Ranka seeing him with Sheryl and then wallowing in her own sadness about it afterwards.  However, with Alto being the resident princess of the series, it's not a far stretch to say he certainly can act like one at times. Ranging from his daddy issues leading to him running away from home to become a pilot, or how he likes to ignore any real problems that he faces, there's almost nothing about him that doesn't scream \"Princess\". He even has gorgeous flowing locks of hair to accentuate this. In fact, I have no doubt that some would start to question his manhood, as he practically ignores any advances from both Sheryl and Ranka, which goes back to him being largely at fault for the triangle never progressing. Any time it seems like he's made up his mind about who he wants to be with, the next episode has some bad news for you, as he basically does the equivalent of saying \"Just kidding!\", and begins to show what can be considered interest in the opposite girl. As for the whole \"Princess\" nickname and his daddy issues, they are touched on briefly, but it comes off as nothing more than the writers quickly throwing together some semblance of a back story so that they could pass him off as more than your average self-insert main character. \\n\\n\r\nHaving Alto bounce back and forth between who it seemed he was interested in clearly shows which characters are supposed to be the selling point of the series, and of course, I can only be talking about Ranka and Sheryl. Long winded fan boy name calling and debates aside for now, they both have their ups and downs as characters.\\n\\n\r\nRanka, who is easily the character who receives the most focus in the series, happens to be the one who receives the least development for all the time she spent on screen (Go figure). She manages to slowly get over her timid nature when it comes to singing, but only because of the encouragement Alto gives her throughout the series. Although this was good however, even with her having the most interaction with other characters and general screen time, she never developed a reason for singing past doing it for Alto's affection. Due to the fact that the time spent on her was poorly utilized, her development was hindered in the long run. This is made especially apparent when you see that a few of the side characters have more motivation for their actions than she does. For the sheer amount of focus the series gave her character, seeing them do nothing with it past the first few episodes was disappointing to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nSheryl, on the other hand, plays a much more interesting role in the series. Many pass her off as \"Bitchy\", \"Overly arrogant\" and many other demeaning terms from the moment she appears on screen, but she manages to easily become the best character in the cast. With her status established right from the beginning, it's not unfitting for her to act much like she runs the place. Providing a stark contrast from Ranka, Sheryl is confident and domineering to an extent, yet still caring of others, shown by her attitude towards Ranka and Alto. She eventually softens up a bit, mostly due to her feelings for Alto since he doesn't worship her like everyone else in the colonies. The struggle she goes through while falling from the top as Ranka took over is far more believable than anything Ranka or Alto went through. Having to cope with her fall from stardom, as well as her impending death due to a disease, she accepts these facts and still tries to move forward, doing the only thing she can do: sing. This made her far more endearing to the audience by the end of the series, as this shows her confidence wasn't simply based on her status as the Galactic Fairy, but her strength of will that was built up through living her old lifestyle of complete poverty. While she did remain mostly static, what she went through didn't feel contrived, much like the case was with Ranka. \\n\\n\r\nBut of course, like many other series, one of the biggest problems Macross Frontier presents is the ending. Again, I find myself questioning Alto's sexuality, as the ending provides zero closure for what is considered the main focus of the series: the love triangle between the three main characters. This is Macross, the plot is only there to help move the romance forward, and that's one thing Frontier severely failed at. Not only was Alto himself preventing it from taking a big step forward with his indecisiveness and constant character changes, the sheer amount of conveniences that kept the character's relationships from developing sure didn't help either. Like I mentioned, the filler episodes would mostly focus on the love triangle, but focusing on it is not the same as actually having it progress. Regardless of how much it actually progressed by the end, a conclusion is needed, and that's something the series never provided. While it was very heavily suggested that Sheryl \"won\" before the finale, the final moments of the series throw the entirety of the few episodes Alto was together with Sheryl right out the window, and has Ranka enter the competition once more. \\n\\n\r\nAs we all know, Alto has a major fascination for the sky, more so than for the two girls who fawned over him for the entire series. So what does he do? He doesn't clearly choose either girl, but instead chooses the mother fucking sky. Whether it was intentionally done this way so that the Sheryl and Ranka factions wouldn't destroy the world due to a simultaneous outburst of angry fan boys crying over the fact that their waifu \"lost\", or because they wanted to leave it up for interpretation, it doesn't change the fact that giving no closure severely impacts the series in a bad way. And when one of the main selling points of the Macross franchise is left untouched, it leaves nothing more than disappointment in the eyes of fans and newcomers alike. While making no decision on which girl the main character wants to be with may be a common occurrence in most harem series, it should not be the case when there is only a love triangle at hand. When ample time is given to devote to two characters and their interactions with the main character, going down this route is nothing more than a bad decision as it should be nearly impossible to get fans to feel satisfied with this kind of ending. It was a shame to see them use this kind of cheap exit strategy after putting forth the effort to develop the relationships in the series.  \\n\\n\r\nAfter all of this, there's nothing left but disappointment in the series. There may have been good j-pop, great action scenes, as well as throwbacks to previous entries in the franchise ranging from songs, to name drops and simple phrases, but that only adds to the enjoyment factor. And as most intelligent people will know, even that isn't enough to save a series which continually makes mistakes along the way. At the end of the day, Macross Frontier had a lot of potential, but unfortunately it was ruined by Alto who could not manage to keep the series flying smoothly.",

            "content": "This review is from the point of view of someone who does not like mecha anime and has never watched the Macross series from the beginning because when people mention Macross, they mention mecha.  This fear was unfounded as I sat down to watch the first episode.  Variable Fighters aren't mecha. I will say it again, Variable Fighters are not mecha.  With my bias firmly established, let's go into my review.\r\nThe story itself is well executed with small revelations trickling in, tying together a bigger mystery.  There's even a love triangle involved, which also insinuates itself very well to the action.Otherwise, there is nothing much different from the standard humans vs. aliens in a fight for survival kind of story that it really is.\\n\\n\r\nVariable Fighters are sexy, so sexy its criminal.  Yes they are the focal point of the show and yes, it deserves this praise.  Character design, on the other hand, could use a little less glowy hair.  In fact, Sheryl Nome looks like a woman who puts out, very very often because of it.  They must have forgotten that they left the dial at 11.  The setting and background are passable as well, no real blemishes and varied palettes make this one a winner.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I'm not a fan of pop music, but well it goes great with the anime, being centred around pop superstars anyway.  Yes, I will also admit to having acquired the Original Sound track, by Yoko Kanno et al., who is one of my favourite composers.  As I'm listening to it as I type this review, it does a fine job of standing alone and the chance remains high that I'll be leaving this on in the background as I do other things.  The sound effects on the other hand, aren't that spectacular, doing a good job, but that's about it.  Voice acting is well done, I can't say its bad.  The tones really bring out the nuances in a character, which I applaud.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, they are all well thought out.  A point made during the show even calls into question Alto's motivation for fighting and its in that exploration that makes Alto such a good character.  He really grows into his own and for once in a blue moon, does not have an emo moment as most child soldiers are want to do.  Not to be outdone, supporting characters are even fleshed out well, Mikhail to name one.  Cherish them, for you never know when they're going to be taken away from you.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment?  Well, let's just say I thought this was like watching a better Top Gun, IN SPACE.  Awesome. This kind of makes me regret not having gotten in to Macross earlier.  WellI think I'll go acquire Super Dimension Fortress Macross now.  One last thing, Variable Fighters are not mecha, if you want to dispute that claim, please use my comments box.",

            "content": "As a guy who grew up on the original SDF Macross some 18 or so years ago, it isn't really a surprise that I would end up watching this show.  I was wondering when we would get a next Macross series. \r\nStory:\r\nA little disappointing that the story is moving at a snail's pace but it seems to be taking a much needed boost, after episode 9 threw a whole boatload of information at us.  Seems like Macross Galaxy (related to General Galaxy?) could be Frontier's Weyland-Yutani...?  Who knows, but it's starting to be a whole lot more interesting.  \r\nArt:\r\nMuch like SDFMacross, this series has some of the best and worst animation I have seen in a long time.  The backgrounds are amazing, the attention to detail is great, and the CG is generally extremely well done.  A real shame that the character animation at times can be really poor.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWhat I like about Macross is that the character development is much more subtle.  People have commented that Sheryl's behavior makes little sense.  Pay attention, it does make sense.  On the flipside, we haven't seen much from Alto which is a damn shame because he's the main lead.  Anyhow, it's nice that the show addresses Alto's feminine appearance.\\n\\n\r\nSide characters could use some work though.  Still, we're not even half way so I'm not worried yet.  \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIt's no Macross Plus, but it's generally been impressive.  The songs are catchy (she's the bloody Galactic Fairy...of course it's going to be *trashy* bubblegum pop) and some are nice in their own right such as Aimo and Diamond Crevasse.  The battle music was better in the other Macross shows, but it's hardly something to complain about when it's still pretty solid.     \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIt has been a long time since I've enjoyed the action so much.  The reuse of some animation is obvious, but generally it's nothing to worry too much about until we see the same VF-171 or tan-coloured VF-25 get blown up again and again.  Everything is fast, crisp, and well choreographed.  Helps too that the CG is pretty damn impressive.  \\n\\n\r\nToo long, didn't read?  Macross Frontier is not 'deep'.  Macross Frontier is not philosophical.  Macross Frontier is good old fun with a spark of quality to it.  I wouldn't have my Macross any other way.",

            "content": "Story: \r\nI tried to like the story but it opted for cheesy melodrama, bad action sequences and a love triangle that I did not care about. It tries to go for gut wrenching emotions but falls short because it does not bother to establish a conflict we truly care about, nor does it establish characters that I really cared about much at all.\r\nArt: \r\nThe art ranges from absolutely awful, to pretty good, sometimes varying wildly between episodes. One thing that I absolutely hated was the CGI dogfight scenes, the action and the choreography were well done, but the computer generated graphics felt clunky and outof place, and could have been replaced with hand drawn frames with more fluidity. \\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n The music and sound effects in this anime are absolutely wonderful. I am a major fan of Kanno Yoko's work, and the music here is her working masterfully. I loved both Sheryl's Techno arena hits and Ranka's ballads also the classical mood music is wonderful and it evokes the traditional feel of the Macross franchise.  \\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nTruthfully I can't stand most of the major characters, Sheryl is the only one that I like and that I feel plays out realistically.  Alto is a major jerk to everyone, and it's a wonder to me that he even has two love interests, thinking on how he treats them. Ranka is whiny and timid, except when she sings, we can see this play out throughout the the series, her character never changes from that mold. Sheryl at least is the only one that acts in a believable and likable way. She is confident and arrogant in a way you would expect a star of her caliber to be, yet she is not unkind and shows streaks of humor that I find to be very likable.\\n\r\nEnjoyment / Overall:\\n\r\nI enjoy Macross  Frontier mostly for its characters and the wonderful music. I keep hoping for interesting dramatic developments or good action scenes but I come away disappointed every episode. So it earns a mild recommendation on my part. \\n",

            "content": "Allow me to say: epic final battle was epic, spoilers abound, etc\r\nStory: Definitely interesting. In broad, it seems quite cliche (Aliens attack space colony, humans fight back), but if looked closer and given more detail, it's actually quite an intersting, but not totally original story. So far, it had focused a lot on developing the characters while throwing out the occasional dogfight and twist (Episode 13 = major twist), but it is laid out so it fits together well, and it's very interesting. Unfortunately, it suffers pretty bad pacing, which is very noticable towards the end, where they crammed tons of information and sudden revelations,resulting in information overload. I thought they could've lengthened it by a few more episodes to properly fit the whole story in, but wouldn't want the ruin the 25 theme (25th anniversary, 25 episodes, final episode aired September 25th, VF-25, etc). There are also many references to previous Macross titles, such as some Macross 7 songs and titles, Deculture, Macross Zero and the movie, pineapple salad, so it will appeal to the fans of the whole franchise.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I have to say, the CGI in Macross F is the best I've ever seen in an anime. Dogfights between the Macross Frontier Galaxy fleet and the Vajra are absolutely stunning, with flowing visuals and beautifully rendered variable fighters and Vajra. They certaintly didn't skimp on this area of animation, and it must have cost shitloads to make. Some people do complain that it feels &quot;out of place&quot; and prefer hand-drawn scenes. I myself think that this addition and mix of CGI and traditional drawn scenes is very innovative, and feels natural (Unlike GONZO LOL quality CGI) The CGI alone is enough to warrant a 10. However, the character art and animation are not so pleasing. Out of scenes using CGI, I would say that the animation is mediocre, and looks out of place compared to the near flawless CGI scenes. The characters are sometimes badly animated, and aren't drawn well. Ultimately, the mediocre character animations bring down the overall quality of the art to an 8.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I do know that Macross is renowned for its music, and Macross F does not disappoint in this area. The quality of the music is consistently high throughout the series, and it actually gets even better towards the end. The music is probably the best as it can get nowadays. They've managed to weave quite an amount of music into the anime without it sounding out of place or inappropriate, resulting in some kickass scenes, notably episode 7, where a massive dogfight took place with Sheryl singing Infinity at the same time. Aimo is also a very nice song, but was overused in the 2nd half. The best scene where the music truly shines the brightest is the final fight, where Sheryl and Ranka duke it out in a duet that lasted more than 8 minutes, and coupled with the epic final battle which was taking place at the same time. tl;dr: Music is nothing less than awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe VAs are also very good, especially Ranka's because she actually sings some of the songs, and she is a newcomer into the VA industry. Fantastic stuff.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Macross F has a wide plethora of characters, and the main characters are shown in the plot without overwhelming the numerous side characters. The characters are all very interesting, whether they be main characters or side, and so far there is lots of character development and interesting background information pertaining certain characters. The events portraying side characters are just as, if not more exciting than the main characters' event, and it's quite pleasing, as most animes and mangas focus too much on the central, main characters whilst leaving the side characters out. However, I disliked Alto, because he was extremely indecisive about his relationship with the two girls (Love Triangle), and it didn't feel right about how he was handling the situation. Hell, the side characters are actually more likeable and interesting than the main characters, like Bobby, he was just plain greatness as a GAR pilot for the Macross Quarter, and hilarious when not battling. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Macross F is a damn interesting anime, and it almost never fails to grab the interest of the viewers, especially during space fights, which don't occur often, but when they do, it is a huge dose of awesomeness. The music too is very enjoyable to listen to, and live performances with Sheryl in them are simply an excellent blend of above average character animation and fanservice. Fanservice is not uncommon in Macross F, and it is often used more for humour's sake than just showing body parts to the viewers. Which reminds me, the humour in Macross F is sometimes spontaneous, but when it is, it is generally very enjoyable. The music, and the mecha porn is what makes the series so fun to watch and springs forth the &quot;WHERE ARE MY MACROSS F SUBS FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUU-&quot; sort of attitude. The love triangle will probably frustrate you to no end, however, as it's not much fun watching Alto acting like a massive idiot when it comes to the two girls.\\n\\n\r\nMacross Frontier was a great anime, with great music, great artwork, and an interesting storyline, unfortunately marred by somewhat bad main characters interaction and bad pacing. It wasn't quite epic win as I earlier predicted, but the final battle was more than enough to redeem it. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a great watch for both fans of the previous Macross series and newcomers, and it will definitely catch your attention. I say go for it, if you haven't watched it yet.",

            "content": "Watched this show 3 times now, and I have to say, it just may be my favorite anime to date. With a great story, the best sounds track i have ever heard, fantastic animation quality, great character design that i will never forget, I almost feel bad for those who have not gotten to enjoy the show yet. I need to comment on the music. If you're a macross fan you know that the show revolves around music and the power of song, and these tunes are rockin. With the second OP \"Lion\" or Sheryl Nomes Diamond Crevasse, The music keeps the flow of theshow going. \\n\\n\r\nThe Battles, fought in the depths of space are full of action and beautiful animation, they all have an electric flow, and are generally in sync with the Music, making all fights extremely engaging, both for your ears and your eyes.\\n\\n\r\nMacross frontier is so intense that the first episode, to me, felt more like a finale than a first episode. When macross quarter punched a certain opposing enemy IN THE FACE I had a shiver of win creep down my spine. \\n\\n\r\nOne point i would like to make. I dont like exagerating. I dont like lying. When I tell you now that macross frontier has the very best finale I have ever seen, I mean it. I have never seen a more satisfying end. Closure, new songs and mixes, a bit of a twist and the best space battle EVER.\\n\\n\r\nThough, I cant say ALL positives so i will say this. with the three main characters, alto, sheryl, and ranka, I feel that rankas character fell apart. It was at first a close love triangle, then as their story's progressed, they changed, but it seemed as though the writers were not sure what to do with ranka lee's  character at one point, and it kind of trailed off.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this show was GREAT, and even if you havnt seen another macross series, you can fully enjoy this one. I give this show a perfect 10, I was totally blown away. thank you for reading my review",

            "content": "I\u2019ve been watching every macross these past weeks, and this one is definitely the worst entry of the franchise. The music is amazing, the rest not so much. In every series i watched, i found the cast to be more or less really good, some characters i disliked strongly but not enough to trash the whole show; macross F manages to have the WORST cast out of every macross. Sheryl and Ranka are the saving grace of it, and Brera is also a good character, everyone else was either a blatant carbon copy of a past character (Cathy is obviously inspired by Misa and soon) or straight up unlikable. Alto is the worst macross protagonist ive met, his looks and background are so good but his personality? not so much. It\u2019s obvious from the very beginning of the series that he prefers Sheryl, and yet he keeps on being uncertain and misleading Ranka, who ends up with a broken heart each time. The treatment of female characters in this show is absolutely terrible, from Ranka and Sheryl who are used for the worst love triangle i\u2019ve ever seen, to girls like Cathy, Nanase, Klan, who did absolutely nothing except being used for fanservice and add to the amount of couples this show has. Klan was especially bad, the whole mess of having a different body when being micronized was absolutely disgusting, every other micronized zentradi is normal and then you have this girl who has either huge boobs or a childlike body depending on her size. Disgusting. Her romance with Michael was terrible as well, Michael always treated her like garbage and now before dying he confesses? Give me a break.\\n\r\nThe enemies weren\u2019t good either, Grace was the pinnacle of unlikable, the other guy was so irrelevant i dont even remember his name; all he did in this show is have sex with Cathy in one of the first episodes and thats about it.\\n\r\nLong story short: this show is shit. The music is fantastic but you can listen to it without watching this crappy anime.",

            "content": "I like campiness sometimes.  Macross and Robotech were campy but enjoyable.  Sure I never liked most of the main cast but there were elements that made me enjoy the series, both when I was a kid and later when I grew older.  \r\nProblem is, I haven't seen a Macross that's captured the same spirit as the originals except from possibly Macross Plus.  I never could understand this, it's not a difficult formula but it's never executed the same.\r\nLet's start with the premise: it's a love triangle story (coincidentally, the 1st opening theme is called \"Triangular\") where you the three main charactersare unlikable because of their glaring faults: Alto is a stubborn sissy that accidentally became a pilot from the circus (sound familiar?), Sheryl is a pompous star that can't express her true feelings but her pride just ruins her character, and Ranka who had the most potential was never fully explored throughout and thus you can't decide if you want to like her, much less care for her.\\n\\n\r\nI guess you could compare that to Hikaru/Minmei/Misa (Rick/Minmay/Lisa for the Robotech junkies) and Isamu/Guld/Myung thing too, yet you can actually feel bad for each character.  Macross F doesn't really let you do that, for 22 episodes (at least), the story flounders around everyday life while dabbling with the overlying plot.  Nothing really advances with any of the characters except some secrets that *eventually* get uncovered.  Problem is, sometimes those potentially plot-twisting secrets pop up, but then disappear for episodes until you kind of forget about it.  It's fine once or twice in a series, but when you pile layers upon layers of secrets to the point you don't even know what's most important, then you've lost the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThe Macross factor: the music.  I don't believe everything Yoko Kanno is necessarily gold and while I enjoy this soundtrack, it's not the best thing I've heard of in my life.  There's only about 3 songs I enjoy listening too, the rest...meh.  Nothing is really memorable that really sticks unfortunately, maybe it's because they introduce 28934239 tracks by both singers and constantly bombard you either with the same song over and over, or recurring songs layered with another new song.  It gets irritating.  You don't need a huge berth of new mediocre vocal tracks, stick with a couple solid songs and let it be that.\\n\\n\r\nThis series could have easily been knocked down to 13 episodes, took out a few characters and/or combined a few elements.  It's relatively predictable, feels like a lot of filler, characters aren't really all that likable, and the music is OK.  The series does go out with a great bang (the final song is incredible), but getting there was painful.  I wouldn't put it on par with Macross Plus, but definitely not the worst I've seen.",

            "content": "This is my first review, so hopefully I don't say anything to out of place. I've heard a lot about Macross from a lot of my classmates and I decided that I wanted to take a shot at it. I will say that I was not disappointed at all. \r\nStory 8/10\r\nThe story of Macross Frontier features colonies of people that are scattered around the galaxy in mega-sized domes similar to earth. The story overall wasn't completely original. Hostile Aliens threatening to exterminate the human race. Mecha units that are reminiscent to StarScream of the Transformer series. The thing that caught my eye was how musicplayed a huge factor in the series. Macross has always had a history of having music have a large impact and in this case, music was an integral part. At times, there were moments when the series would sometimes get a little corny, but it was tolerable with some great action scenes that came with it. In my opinion, Macross has never made Jets look so cool. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThe Art in Frontier is pretty good to stay the least. The visuals were excellent, and since I was able to find a website that had pretty good quality in it, I was able to enjoy it much more. There were a decent amount of scenes that had the characters emotions shown quite vividly. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nMacross has always been known for its music, and in this case it wasn't any different. The music was pretty catchy, especially the songs that were sung by Nakajima Megumi. I even downloaded one of the soundtracks. One of my favorite songs from her now is Seikan Hikou. The opening and ending songs were pretty catchy too which led me to enjoy the series even more. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nThis is probably the only drop off point for me. The main character Alto is a pretty generic character that has been featured in a whole lot of series. He may have a few bravado moments, but he its the fact that he is completely oblivious to the feelings of the female characters that frustrates me. The next main character Sheryl Nome/Norm is one of the two heroines and she is a little bit more decent. She hides her true feelings with strength and seeing flashbacks of her past shows some reasons why. Though as I have stated above, I am still unsure how she can fall for a character such as Alto. The final main character Ranza Mei is the only reason why Im rating the character portion a 7. She is adorable to say the least, and her personality fits her character a lot. Since she is deemed adorable, she is one of the most likeable characters in the series. Though she may fall off as the damsel in distress at times, she does have some moments where she shows that she even has her own moments of a \"fighting spirit\". \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nEven though the main cast may not have been perfect. I absolutely loved the fighting scenes. I even found it even more interesting how the much music was a large part of it which made me enjoy it anymore. Though Macross has been doing this for awhile, it has always been quite ambitious for them to have songs a part of an intense fighting scene. Some of the music that was a part of the fighting scenes were quite catchy as well which made the dog fights that much more enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nI was inclined to first give this a 8, but this is a series that I would definitely love to watch again. My only regret would be that I have not watched a whole lot of Macross and this is the first series that I have watched. I will probably watch the rest of the Macross Series in order to understand the universe much more. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!",

            "content": "Where to start....So it's been essentially 4 years since the last Macross installment and a 12 year time skip since the prequel of this series: Macross Dynamite 7.\r\nStory: After the Deculture Special during Christmas in 2007, I was rather impressed with the series alone with just that one episode, especially with the introduction of another member of the Nome family.  However, it was almost obvious from not only the deculture episode, but the first few episodes of this series that it was going to turn into a love triangle series...a big no-no since it began to carry too much of the weight of theplot and we really didn't get much of a thorough development of the plot.  Results were almost like magic for the most part, especially with Sheryl's case in episode 25 when she is  magically cured from the V-Type Infection and no other explanation followed of how Ranka helped her.  To some extent, it almost came to the point of Gundam Seed Destiny, but I'm glad it didn't cross the line.  Had the series not wasted on a few episodes of love triangle, they could have gone far more in depth with the cases of the Vajra, Sheryl's past, and Ranka's past.  Character development was weak for this show, and had they used those episodes to emphasize on these, it would have aided in both the score of the story and character.  This is almost a failure in comparison with Macross Zero, but when compared to the prequel: Macross 7 and Dynamite 7, this is an epic piece of work.  \\n\r\nOnly two other factors are keeping this score up: 1) the announcement of a movie and 2) the tying together of most if not all the previous Macross series.  The upcoming movie gives hope to the series from just ending as if it were a waste of time by focusing on the love triangle.  Perhaps we will get something as tragic as the first Macross series or even Macross Zero with the movie?  Macross being notorious for sad moments of important and likeable characters (ie Lynn Minmay, Sara Nome, etc...) may bring this series around and thus raises confidence that this series is not out of steam yet despite the relatively decent ending to the TV series.  For the second factor, Macross fans will remember various bits and parts as well as the famous Lynn Minmay and Mao Nome who are showed and hinted at throughout many times during the series.  Macross Zero and the first Macross series were heavily emphasized in this series and that really helped put everything in place for Macross fans.  New viewers to the series may seem a bit confused as to some of the references and terminology, but the series does not completely alienate them as some explanation is provided making these viewers feel a bit more at ease.  8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: There's really nothing much to say here.  Although tv rips were bad and made animation look like it was deteriorating as episodes went by, especially episode 25, after checking this show out on DVD/Blu-ray, animation was nearly flawless.  You could almost see every bit of frame work involved in perfect the fight and concert scenes.  It was absolutely beautiful to watch and the best part is that there's no strain on the eyes when watching :D  Drawings were also a bit off at times, but that I'm sure will be fixed as more DVDs and Blu-Rays are released.  10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Does this really need to be commented on for this series?  When you bring Yoko Kanno into the picture, you might as well just give a 10/10 immediately.  She is the only anime music composer to have made top 3 in Oricon charts AFTER 1 WEEK of sales, and continues to remain as so with the addition of both Macross Frontier OSTs and soon a third OST this coming December.  Her first work to do so was End of Evangelion and ever since then, no other series or artists have done the same for an anime production.  In addition, the recruiting of May'n and Megumi Nakajima to sing as Sheryl Nome and Ranka Lee made it all the more better.  This is something to really look forward to if the movie in the making contains even more of Kanno, Nakajima, and May'n's masterpieces. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  As stated earlier, character development as overall relatively weak.  We got some insights on Sheryl's, Alto's, and Ranka's past, but it still feels lacking.  All we got were bits of flashbacks with no real detail.  The viewer is essentially being told to accept these things as if they did occur.  With nothing bridging the time skip as well as the many references to previous Macross series, it really does not bring out the actual identity of these characters.  One big example is  Brera...If he was blown to bits by the Vajra, how did he survive even revived as a cyborg?  Another is Mikhail/Michael; they made a huge deal out of his death in episode 20, and yet we didn't learn much about him except his deceased sister, which again we are suppose to take in as a fact with no further explanation.  The series just doesn't do very well bringing out what viewers want to know about the characters.  If anything, this series could have gone at least 30 episodes to really develop the characters and the love triangle rather than have wasted our time in 1997-98 with the 1 year, 49 episodes trash of Macross 7.  Those additional episodes could have been well spent here.  Length for this series would have been better if were around the length of the first Macross series: 36 episodes, which really brought out the meaning of Macross and its characters. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: All in all, this was a great watch.  I looked forward to this series every time it had aired.  The first couple episodes weren't great, but episode 7 onwards really hit the spot.  Episodes 7, 15, 20-25 really nailed the series for me and more of those kind of episodes were needed in this series.  Ranka was always enjoyable to watch and Sheryl always trying to act tough as well as her deeply emotional side was also great.  Alto was really just a wimp except the last two episodes where he really stood out a bit.  Ozma was badass and that really made numerous scenes even more enjoyable.  The characters themselves made the series enjoyable regardless of lack of development and the announcement of a movie after the final episode made it even more exciting. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Considering how I gave Code Geass R2 a 9/10, I would have to give this series a 10/10.  Why?  Because it was better than Geass R2.  Macross Frontier had been overshadowed by Geass R2 for more than half the air time, and what does Geass R2 do?  It gives us a crappy result...again Sunrise fails at sequels.  Geass R2 was the most anticipated series in Spring 2008 by most anime audiences and left Macross Frontier literally to rot.  By Summer 2008, both series seem to begin to get their acts together.  They were literally on par with each other, and from there, the curves go separate paths where Macross gets better and better with each episode while Geass R2 began to go down the drain.  R2, ended okay but only after 5-10 episodes of pain, a completely supernatural and unbelievable/uneasy plot, and train-wreck anticipations.  Macross Frontier on the other hand was relatively consistent to the end, holding a steady plot for the most part and giving at least a non-rushed ending, an awesome duet medley, and better yet the opportunity for further explanations for the series, or even a sequel!  Geass R2 on the other hand is now left in the dust with the cliffhanger ending of wondering whether or not  Lelouch is dead or not and something fans will never know.  Therefore, Macross Frontier deserves better than for not only its underdog status, but also its lack of attention.  10/10",

            "content": "(Warning: contains spoilers)\r\nMacross F (or Frontier) is extremely impressive, because I never thought an anime about idols singing teaming up with giant robots in space to save the world together could be THIS dull. It also puzzles me how people sing this so much praise, claiming it's the best Macross installment. Let me just make it clear that this is the first Macross I have watched; and yet, it was so bad it almost killed any desire I had of checking out the rest of the franchise.\r\nI'll try my best to keep it short, but let me break down what I think are some ofthe most critical points that made F a bad anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts following Alto Saotome, a pilot trainee, as he crosses paths with Sheryl Nome, a famous idol, and Ranka Lee, a regular girl who dreams of becoming one, as bug-like aliens known as the Vajra invade the Frontier. Alto is then scouted into the Military, getting caught up between his battle duty and his relationship with Sheryl and Ranka, who increasingly get more and more involved with the intergalactic battles as well. Sounds interesting, right? Well, keep yourself seated. From then on, things start to get complicated; characters are introduced left and right. Political conflict, cyborgs, biological diseases, tragic backstories and copious amounts of romance are thrown into the mix. Everything quickly becomes extremely convoluted: they are unable to properly develop and explain everything they want to show us. Thus, Macross F suffers with HUGE issues in pacing and tone, especially pacing - there were some occasions where I kept asking myself if I missed out on something, because things happened so quickly I couldn't keep up.\\n\\n\r\nWhen your main plot (and 60 subplots branching from it) is going this fast, of course it will crash. Things happened extremely suddenly, and with no foreshadowing whatesoever; we're just supposed to take at face value that Grace is the main antagonist, in a sudden reveal that makes it hard to take it seriously when nothing in the episodes leading up to this hinted on it. You're just supposed to accept that Mikhail's sister is dead, and that Sheryl was found rummaging through garbage and parentless (a huge plot inconsistency), and that Luca has a crush on Nanase. The reveal of the motive for Grace and the Vajra is so stupid I couldn't contain my laughter. And with all that, the big, emotional moments such as character deaths and tearful goodbyes are extremely hard to care about. Why should I when you squashed your reasons into a single one minute long scene instead of developing the characters properly throughout the show? And there is also the big bad of the entire thing: the love triangle, and the other smaller romances. A love triangle between Alto, Sheryl and Ranka was EXTREMELY unnecessary. I cannot stress enough how unnecessary it was, and how much it empoverished the show. There's no need to measure words: it was garbage. Alto treated both girls really badly (I'll expand on this later) and the girls would often commit acts of love for him, and feel motivated to do things for him, when they don't give them a single reason. Not to mention that, in the end, after all that kissing and crying and touching, Alto doesn't even end up with either one. If you're going to write in a shitty love triangle into your setting about giant robots, at least compromise and give it a proper resolution instead of this cowardly, open ending bullshit. There's also a lot of dumb ass things that made no sense I could point out (like Ranka becoming famous overnight on the same beat as Sheryl falls out of stardom to the point people wouldn't recognize her on the street), but if I were to list them all I'd be here all week - there were just too many. To finalize, the battle scenes, which should be the highest point of F, put me to sleep. They are messy, full of the characters spouting bullshit technical terms and plot exposition that often made little sense, and I found myself completely uninterested in anything going on, even visually.\\n\\n\r\nBut well, as if all of this wasn't enough, the characters were even worse. Yes, I am sorry to say, they were so poorly written it was horrifying. Starting with Alto, our protagonist: I don't know what went so wrong here. Maybe they were aiming to make him a tsundere or just broody, but what they came out with was an asshole. Don't be fooled by descriptions saying Alto is \"a normal high schooler\" or \"just a little broody\". Alto is unlikeable from the get-go: he's always disproportionately angry at any and everything for absolutely no reason. He is always yelling at his own friends. And he is always treating the two girls who are in love with him like hot garbage -  ESPECIALLY Ranka. It was painful and infuriating to see him make disgusted faces at Ranka and ignore her texts and calls, acting like she was a hassle but still leading her on while she was clearly in love with him. He was also overly aggressive with Sheryl, going as far as screaming at her about her lack of professionalism because she got sick while the girl is bedridden, so ill that she can't get up or move. Then he had random moments of tenderness where he acted nice to them, even though minutes prior he was being the biggest prick in the world, only to return to his default asshole state later. That's because his personality is about as consistent as a pile of diarrhea. He undergoes no real character development, which, well, guess it's fair since his entire character is so intolerable and inconsistent to begin with that I don't see any salvation. He had an interesting background as a Kabuki actor, but they barely explored it - and when they did, it was in the dumbest ways you can imagine, namely jokes about him being a \"princess\" and his brother trying to convince him to quit battling and going back to acting AS THE PLANET WAS ON THE VERGE OF BEING DESTROYED. Oh yeah, they also tried to explain the fact that he acts like a wolf with rabies with him having a dead mom. When this is the main character of your story, you're already starting off on the wrong footing.\\n\\n\r\nThe other two main characters are Sheryl and Ranka, who, like beaming hope at the end of a tunnel, are surprisingly both likeable and reasonably consistent. Ranka gets more relevance and a bigger role in the story; she is a bright, cheerful and kind young girl with a love of singing and a dream of becoming an idol, who later uses her voice to help fighting off the Vajra. Her lighthearted optimism sometimes almost made me forgot how annoying everything else was. But unfortunately, Ranka gets treated horribly by her own narrative; between her family trauma, Alto being an absolute bitch, both the heroes and the villains using her for her magic voice, and even brainwashing, she doesn't seem to catch a break. Most of her motivation centers around Alto as well, which is absolute bonkers when she has two older brothers and friends who both care for and encourage her more than Alto ever did in his entire sorry life; ultimately, Ranka also gets very little development, only becoming very slightly less childish by the end. Sheryl, on the other hand, is headstrong, confident and a little arrogant, if anything - not without reason - with a friendlier side to her. She's extremely fun to watch and she owns the show whenever she's on the screen. But, once again, unfortunately, her character development is poorly handled. Instead of teaching her how to be more humble and caring of others, the narrative punishes her for her confidence with a terminal illness. The idea is that she is at her best when she's depressed and dying, rather than thriving on her career and aware of her own talent and presence. And again, the love triangle butts in to make things worse, where Sheryl acts oddly ooc when she's around Alto. Sheryl and Ranka's friendship has so much lost potential, too. The very few scenes they have together are very sweet, but they all end with Alto showing up to ruin everything. Sometimes they were weirdly, vaguely hostile to each other, because I guess they absolutely have to since they like the same guy. Go figure.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast... I don't even know if I should expand on them and make this review even longer than it already is. Let me just say they are bad, cookie cutter archetypes, and that I wish writers knew that they don't HAVE to pair up every single character with each other in forced, nonsense, dogshit romances. Every time Mikhail and Klan were onscreen with their bullshit I felt like barfing. Desk Man, Sugita Man, whatever is his name because I quite frankly don't remember or care, was the most boring villain I've ever seen and so ugly he hurt my eyes. Brera and Ozma were alright, as they at least they were consistent and nice to Ranka unlike everyone else in this show. In short, all you need to know is that none of them are particularly remarkable. Or interesting. Or well written. Or even good looking (Mikhail is really ugly, sorry to note. Who designed this?). What is with mecha anime with school settings and adding dozens of uninteresting, underdeveloped stereotyped characters and expecting us to care about them all? I've sat through this with Valvrave and Code Geass and it's disappointing to see the pattern repeated in Frontier.\\n\\n\r\nAt least I can say ONE nice thing about all this, which is: the music is certainly amazing. I'm listening to Diamond Cravasse while I write this review, and Sheryl's vocals are like velvet - whereas Ranka's silky voice works perfectly on their duets, so props for that. I really wish the music was more important than the strange science and spaceships in the plot itself, but it's more of a decoration/thematic background. As for its visuals, maybe they were impressive back in 2008, but it just didn't age too well. The art looks pretty off and there's a bunch of animation blunders. And like I mentioned before, save for a select few, the character designs were offensive to the eye; Klan literally looks like she walked out of porn (what was with her wide eyed blushing every other minute), Cathy and her friends look really boring, Luca has nothing of note besides looking 10 years old and Mikhail is just God's mistake.\\n\\n\r\nSummarizing all of it, Macross F maybe even had potential. A lot of its ideas were interesting and could have been amazing if properly developed and expanded on. But instead they went on the bland romance, misplaced fanservice and trainwreck route. That's a crying shame. I'll just move on to Macross Plus now and try to forget I ever watched this.",

Jaw-droping CG?\r\nIf you answered yes to 2 or more of the above then you'll find Macross Frontier and anime worth your time and heck it might even end up being on your top favorite animes.\r\n[story]:\r\nTo start the story itself does a pretty good job to start by explaining everything that has happened to mankind in this version of reality, so I much give this anime props for not being one that simply throws its viewers into a sea of information and drama for us to sort out ourselves.\r\nTo put it simply the story revolves around a galaxy-known singer named\"Sheryl Nome\" who has come to be also known as the \"Galactic Fairy\", a pilot named \"Alto Saotome\" who left his prestigious family of actors and he's also known as \"Princess\" due to his long hair and the fact that he played such an excellent role as a princess in a past play, and finally there is the rising star \"Ranka Lee\" who through the help and encouragement from Sheryl and Alto is able to reach goals she once thought impossible for her.\\n\\n\r\nThis group of three then coincidentally meet up on a space colony known as \"The Frontier\" and soon become friends, obviously. Through this friendship the story continues to progress as a new threat to mankind appears in the form of the \"Vajra.\" The \"Vajra\" are insect-mech like creatures that appeared out of the blue and have the potential to bring man to the brink of extinction once again, but will our three heroes  be able to do anything before mankind becomes another distant memory in the vast universe?\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Art:]\\n\r\nI'm pretty sure that if you already watched this anime then I don't need to cover this part of the review since if anyone who watched this show would know that the CG animated battles scenes are easily one the biggest highlights of the show, with the other being the soundtrack but I'll go into more detail about the Soundtrack later in the review. \\n\\n\r\nI must also bring up that not only was the CG animation fluid and brilliantly done but the mechanical and overall art designs of the anime were excellent, so you get 2 thumbs up from me Design Staff d(0w0)b\\n\r\nI mean seriously when I was watching this I felt like Macross Frontier was causing me Eye Orgasms, which may explain why I couldn't take my eyes off the screen XP \\n\\n\r\nThe only problem I had with the animation was the repeated use of specific scenes in the space battles with the Vajra. Closer to the end of the series I noticed an increase use of past scenes such as when one specific Vajra would spin and launch its missiles, please excuse my vague description. \\n\r\nHopefully I'm not the only one that noticed this, but other than that the animation was basically flawless ;D\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]:\\n\r\nThis anime isn't also known as a Space Opera for nothing. It has got epic battle scenes and emotional music to accompany it, so who wouldn't love this soundtrack. In fact, I recommend that you go and find the soundtrack and listen to a few of your favorite songs because some of them are just that good.\\n\r\nI'd also like to give a big around of applause for Megumi Nakajima and May Nakabayashi for their exquisite vocal performances as  Ranka Lee and Sheryl Nome.\\n\r\nLet us not forget about the one that brought them all together and produced these masterful works of music for our ears, Masafumi Mima.\\n\\n\r\nThe only con that I could possibly find in the Sound department of this anime would be the tad bit overuse of certain songs such as \"Aimo.\" I understand that the song \"Aimo\" plays an important role in overall story but I quite confident that I'm not the only one who thinks it was being used a bit too much. Hey don't get me wrong I seriously love the song \"Aimo\" heck it's one of my favorite musical pieces in this whole anime what I'm just trying to say is that some of the soundtrack would be been better enjoyed if they weren't sung so often throughout the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Character]:\\n\r\nThis is one of those animes that thanks to it having a longer run-time (more episodes), it was able to establish a close bond between the audience and the characters. Which is usually the main fault in nearly any anime I've watch these days.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part this anime will allow you to grow closer to the characters but maybe not as much as other animes or make you as depressed... *cough* \"Clannad\" *cough*\\n\\n\r\nOverall you'll be able to come to understand Sheryl Nome as someone who is not arrogant diva but someone who has, through her own will, climbed the ladder to the top. We'll also learn of the latent potential and strength of Ranka Lee and her powerful voice. Finally we will bear witness to our main male protagonist, Alto Saotome, grow from naive boy who seeks only his dream to fly through an endless sky to someone who learns what he needs to protect and fight for, but most importantly that though reaching one's dreams brings satisfaction, reaching one's dreams with the ones you love is that much sweeter.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]:\\n\r\nThrough and through I enjoyed this anime greatly, but maybe not to the point of it making it to my list of favorites unfortunately. However, I will say that this anime does deserve the spot for my favorite anime OST since who wouldn't find a song or 2 they like in an anime that has like what 49 songs in its soundtrack? xD\\n\\n\r\nOh and don't get me started with the eye-gasmic CG animation and designs!! I mean WOW I haven't seen that level of visual beauty since I saw something like \"Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children\" or maybe even the \"Mona Lisa?\" xD\\n\\n\r\nI just loved everything about this anime and though it wasn't perfect it had just so much going for it that I could actually ignore the faults it had.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I will definitely recommend this anime for anyone who answered yes to most of the questions I posted at the beginning of this review. \\n\r\nOr even to those who just want to watch something fun and action packed since Macross Frontier definitely fits that bill.",

Also not too much time was focused on backstory but enough for me to understand the setting without watching the previous Macrosses.\r\nArt - The artwork and animation was incredible, i was actually recomended this anime on the basis of the artwork and I have to agree with the guy, HD is well worth it here. For anyonewho loves the style of Shinkai Makoto this is definately for you.\\n\\n\r\nSound - The soundtrack is a tricky one for me.  The J-pop undoubtedly deserves a 10/10 if only for the fact that they've completely changed my attitude towards J-pop.  However the instrumental themes are lacking somewhat and seem to have heavily influenced in places by \"Pirates of the Carribean\", as in there were moments when it becomes undiscernable.  Fortunately these are minimal in the series but if youre looking to download the soundtrack be sure to search out the \"Nyan Tama Vocal Collection\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Each character in this is beautifully fleshed out, not just the main characters but the supporting ones aswell. But also the relationships between characters are so well thought out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - this anime successfully joins action, mecha, romance and comedy.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout and really gives you chance to empathise with the characters. Whats not to love?\\n\\n\r\nI really would recommend this to everyone and anyone so if your plan to watch list isnt to clogged up you should definately throw this on there!",

            "content": "I'm not really into mecha oriented type animes. But this one, as it's predecesors, has love-drama and some others elements that are taken to such a high level of importance and just become essential in the development and coclusion of the anime itself. I think that this is what makes it different from almost any other mecha-type animes.  \r\nThe story starts up strong, full of mysteries and incognits but as it develops it downfalls a bit and concludes poorly at the end. The theme is the same as the other Macross series in the saga, In a galaxy far away in the future. Butthis time the Macross Convoy faces a new enemy: the Vajra, bug like robots that are surrounded by secrecy and darkness. The good thing about the story is the love-triangle development, I really enjoyed the moments that Ranka-Sheryl and Alto spent together but, again, the way they end it up is really mediocre, so it starts really promising but it ends with no as it's started. Also the story has MANY musical events, scenes that are full of live performances or battles combined with music, being the two female lead characters musicians. So expect a lot of interruptions during the story, but don't worry the music is so good that you won't be bothered at all by this. Expect as well numerous references to older Macross animes in some episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and design are just beautiful. The characters look colourful and really movie-style. The space battles look amazing, the action sequences and fights are really entertaining to watch. The world inside the Macross Convoy is just amazing: some parts of it look like San Francisco and others like China, so we've got a lot of variety here, really pleasant to watch. Other stuff to note are the gadgets like the cellphones that are crucial for the love-romance part of the story.Also I found the design of this cellphones quite amusing and funny as well as innovative, they go on par with the rest of the theme perfectly. The design of the females characters blew me away. Ranka looks amazing with her green hair and pretty red eyes and Sheryl just looks so hot with her unique color of hair and the sexy and revealing different oufits she wears during her live performances, definitely eyedrops for the eyes. The only thing I found to be out of place about the artistic part of this anime is the exagerated similarities between the Valkyries (mechas). I mean, one has a sniper riffle and other doesn't and then one is gray colored and the other one blue and... that's it! I really feel that the producers could have done a better job (having the mecha battles a important role in this anime) in putting sort of a spark to each mecha, something that REALLY made one different from another. Other than this, the animation feels taken off a next generation show; the animation quality suggest that Macross Frontier is a movie of some sort, a very high budget movie.\\n\\n\r\nGod the sound. What can I say here? The opening and ending singles are still on the top in Japan charts I think so? Well everything is just perfect about the sound being this a music-conflict resolution anime. The songs in this anime are all just performed for the sake of it and are genius, both in quality and lyrics. There is actually a song from a older Macross \"Watashi no Kare wa Pilot\" that is interpreted in this newer Macross. But putting aside this song the other ones are all new and made exclusively for the series. The sound is definitely the most outstanding aspect of this anime, the music is everywhere, in the love scenes, in the battles sequences, or even in the streets overview! Normally it would be annoying but the music is just that good that it does make up for it. Also the BMG's are adequate for each ocassion and make one feel a stronger impact depending the situation the story is going through.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very well done in looks and personality. Love Ranka's personality and love Sheryl's Looks XD! The development is another matter that needs pointing out. The main male character Saotome Alto just progresses well as the story advances and goes from a simple high schooler to a SMS-Skull Squadron Pilot. The other characters like Ranka and Sheryl have a good development as well: Sheryl goes downfall, being a famous artist at the begining and finishing being opacated by Ranka who goes from singing for fun and in the streets to finally became a famous pop idol and the savior of the Galaxy. But characters like Michael and Lucca just appear out of nowhere and are from the begining members of the SMS, just like that. I found this a bit weird. They are taken into account half way trough and almost when the story reaches it's climax which proves they are vital, at last.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I truly enjoyed this anime from the begining 'till episode 24. The episode 25 wasn't as satisfying and concluding as I expected but it definitely thrilled me enough at the end. I really recommend this anime if you are looking for something really impressive to listen or to watch and you don't care how, to such a extend, a good story can be spoiled at the end, then this should be your first choice because, even if are are not a mecha fan, this anime will be one for you to remember and rewatch on several occassions.",

There, you got ahint of what is about the anime.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about the caracters, Alto is the kind guy you will found in most of the anime, a basic. Sheryl is the girl who will never admit how she feel, and is kinda annoying in the start of the anime, but Ranka is the one outstanding, working hard to get what she want, and make you smile trough her cutness.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation of Macross Frontier are really amazing, even if I didn't watch it in the best quality.\\n\\n\r\nNow the best part, the musics...\\n\r\nHow should I put it, I simply love May'n and Megumi's both voices, you often hear them sing, especially when Alto is fighting, and somehow, it really fits good in the fights.\\n\r\nThe more you advance in the episodes, the more the singing is good, wich makes the finals episode really wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nWell, in the all, it's an anime I really recommend, the story is a classic one who always works, the visual art is impressive, and if you like May'n and Megumi's voices, your ears will burst of pleasure. \\n",

            "content": "~My second review~\r\nHello, everyone! Today I am going to throw out the review on Macross Frontier!\r\nThis anime from the get-go brings much nostalgia from (Original) Macross, Macross Zero and Macross 7.\r\nIf you question the validity of this review you are welcome to do so. I have NOT watched the Macross (original series) but I have watched the movie. I HAVE watched all of the Robotech series and the Macross (Do you remember love Movie)\r\nSo on that context, let me start my review.\r\nAs I stated earlier, there are many points that I found from both the Macross movie and Macross 7. I personally enjoy all ofMacross becuase it centers around culture and music. \\n\\n\r\nThe story from the beginning is powerful and runs along with the memories and traditions of what makes Macross great.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is definately first rate along with the much flashes and absoultely wonderful aircraft flight/fight scenes. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound. Oh my. Just like my previous review on Hikaru No Go, the music in this anime just drew me in instantly when I heard it. Again, this is another anime that just speaks volumes of \"right music at the right time.\" The entire soundtrack absolutely flows. (Not to mention how traditonal it is having music from previous Macross series.) Of course w/ Yoko Kanno at the helm of the soundtrack, it is absolutely grand.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is on one hand interesting and on the other hand inspiring. In these 25 episodes of Macross Frontier they definately try to fart out as much to get you feeling personally with each of these characters and want to hold onto their struggles. And in additon ask why things are going the way they are.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It was a great series if you like seeing things blow up, and want to reminisce about Macross. It's quality is top notch  and it is definitely an anime that I think is worth watching more than once.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nWith great plot, story, character development and an overall wonderful feeling behind it, this anime is for you. If you dislike aircraft, a little bit of drama, and a anime that has a wonderful sense of purpose this anime is most likely not for you.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this review, this was really hard to write w/out spoiling anything.",

            "content": "Having just finished the Macross Frontier, I have to say that this one falls way short of its predecessors. Hiroyuki Yoshino (who is also responsible for the abominations that are Code Gaess and Guilty Crown) seems to think that throwing together everything from his previous shows and whatever\u2019s popular in other successful shows will make a great show. As one blogger rightly commented, \u201cIt\u2019s not the number of ingredients that make a delicious dish\u201d.\r\nNow before I get into the meat of what didn\u2019t work here; I want to give credit where credit is due. The music by Yoko Kanno, as always, was top notch. Althoughthe pop music was a bit Engrishy, that\u2019s common to all J-Pop and they can\u2019t really be faulted there.  I loved the overall designs of Macross Frontier with its whole San Francisco vibe. The fleet shot was also interesting as it made it look like a group of turtles or insects as well as giving the impression of the large-scale of these ships.  I enjoyed all the concert scenes and thought the use of holography in some of Sheryl\u2019s early concerts was pretty inventive and shows a progression in technology from the Sharon Apple concerts in Macross Plus.  But despite this base design, the series went horribly askew when Yoshino took the reins of series composition.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, although well-designed, were poorly developed. I couldn\u2019t consider any of these characters endearing or lovable, and in a year\u2019s time I will have probably forgotten all about them. They were shallow puppets that were used as tools to achieve the creator\u2019s ends, without ever taking on a life of their own.  While Ozama and Catherine\u2019s relationship seems realistic and mature, but the vast majority of relationships were the typical high school romance crap. But they go above-and-beyond the call of duty here; not only are these relationships implausible, but they come out of nowhere and are resolved so poorly.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast, though well-designed, has obvious analogs in Super Dimension Fortress Macross or later incarnations in the series.  The Captain resembles Global. You have the standard chatty girls on the bridge. The enemy, like Gepellnich (in Macross 7) is shrouded in mystery and you don\u2019t get a good look at his/her face 'til the final few episodes. Ranka\u2019s aesthetic is largely influenced by the design for Mao Nome from Macross Zero. Ozama Lee\u2019s role takes on a lot of characteristics of Roy Focker from SDF Macross and Catherine Glass is a clone of Lt. Hayasse.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the villains are utterly worthless.  Their plans are at times transparently obvious and at other times so vague that you could never be expected to understand what they\u2019re talking about. The Vajira themselves, unlike the Zentradi or the Protodevilins of the previous series, are not sentient and react like worker bees to some queen. Even though these hive-mind creatures don\u2019t really think for themselves (except for the pet), they seem to react to Ranka\u2019s songs.  Sounds stupid huh?  Well, their explanation is equally stupid.  I wont spoil it.\\n\\n\r\nPlot\\n\\n\r\nThe plot was scattered and lazy. Political intrigue was full of plot holes and unrealistic to both the way other Macross ships are governed and the way governments function in reality (though this seems to be a consistent problem with Hiroyuki Yoshino). As stated before, they went out of their way to have lots of screen-time with villains saying a lot while remaining so vague that you could never decipher what they were saying.\\n\\n\r\nIn every previous incarnation, Macross ships have had a civilian leader (a mayor or president) and a military leader. In Frontier, part of the military is contracted out to SMS, some sort of private security firm; there doesn\u2019t seem to be any reason for this arrangement. Most of the series only shows SMS getting involved in the conflicts, but toward the end, they start showing another full-sized military force operating out of the Frontier. Yoshino, having no political savvy whatsoever, portrays the President having absolute authority over the military; this goes against all precedent and seems to undermine the notion of separation of power clearly portrayed in Macross 7 and in the original SDF Macross. Though one might mistake the Captain of SMS as the equivalent of Max Genius, he is clearly not a military captain and in fact no one seems to fit this role. The military leaders outside SMS are a bunch of sniveling sycophants who do nothing but react to what\u2019s going on outside the ship (almost as if Yoshino was trying to tell the audience how to react).\\n\\n\r\nThe foreshadowing flashbacks were poorly used and basically showed the same things over and over, trying to make the same obvious point. These flashbacks continue throughout through the end of the series, even though the message is already clear by Episode 10.  The ending was particularly incoherent, and it really answered none of the questions. Relationships are abruptly resolved, if resolved at all, many other threads were just left dangling.\\n\\n\r\nConclusions\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the plot was a sloppy mess.  It wasn\u2019t fun to watch and wasn\u2019t engaging either emotionally or intellectually. There was never really a moment where I didn\u2019t know where this was heading \u2013 no surprises. I don\u2019t feel that this series did anything to expand the Macross universe or the underlying mysteries of the franchise; and despite lots of cameos we really learn nothing of the fate of characters from previous series (with a couple exceptions).\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part though, is while letting this man work on Macross series was possibly a good financial decision, it has ruined what was otherwise an original and authentic saga. Yoshino didn\u2019t seem to care about what came before, except that there was material there to exploit. He merely saw fans of the franchise as potential viewers, then he roped in pop music fans, mecha fans, high school anime fans, and a dozen other tropes in order to maximize his viewership. The man has no integrity as an artist and no respect for a classic property that\u2019s been going since 1982. It had been ten years since Macross 7, so I hope in 2017 (or hopefully sooner) when they get around to making another series, that the original creators don\u2019t let this jackass anywhere near it.",

            "content": "*SPOILERS FOR MACROSS FRONTIER. YOKO KANNO DID THE MUSIC*\r\nIf you asked someone if they`ve seen a Macross show, chances are, they`d say no. If the say yes, then ask them what their favorite one is. Some might say Macross Plus, others may say the original Macross from 1982 (my personal favorite). However, it`s undeniable that the most popular Macross series is Macross Frontier. I`ve already covered the alternate timeline movies that came out after this, so why not look back at the show that spawned them. So, did this soar into the skies, or come crashing down like an idol career? Let`s find out, shallwe?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt`s been over 40 years since the SDF-1 was destroyed, and in those 40+ years, humanity has set up space colonies as they expand their reach to the stars above. Now, after an enemy alien race known as the Vajra start attacking, causing our main lead/ex performer, Alto Saotome, to get on a Veritech to kick some alien ass while saving a girl he just met, Ranka Lee. Together, along with the famous songstress, Sheryl Nome, they end performing their daily lives waiting for the next attack, so that Alto, and the rest of Frontier`s military (which Alto signed up for) to combat the alien threat. Over the course of the series, many characters are revealed with their own evil agenda, like Leon`s coup d'\u00e9tat, or Grace O`Connor`s  plan to use Sheryl, and eventually, rising star, Ranka, to lure the Vajra in order to control them, thus proving her scientific theory to be correct. It gets crazy in the latter half of the series, let me tell `ya, but not as crazy as Gurren Lagann.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAlto, starts off a bit of a Tsundere-ish jerkass to Ranka (all he`s missing is \"BAKA\"), but through learning of his stressful past, and watching him develop during his time spent with Sheryl Nome, and the Frontier military, we see him become a great individual. Sheryl Nome starts out as a very egotistical jackass of a woman, before not only cozying up to Alto and their new friend Ranka (whom Sheryl inspires to become a songstress in the first place), but finding out that her gruesome past comes to bite her as she`s been inflicted with a terminal Vajra V-Type disease as a result of an illegal experiment/surgery Grace put her through.  Ranka is very upbeat most of the time, even despite her apocalyptic past involving the death and destruction of her family and home, only really breaking towards the end when she discovers not only the damage done to her new home, not only that the enigmatic badass and overprotective cyborg is her long lost brother, but also the fact tat she is the missing queen of the Vajras, and the accidental cause of her home`s annihilation...\\n\\n\r\nSOMEONE GIVE THESE PEOPLE A HUG!!!!\\n\\n\r\nOther characters like Michael, the Zentradi with a problem involving the efficiency of shrinking her body to proper proportions when shrinking aka Klan Klein, and a few other military members with their own comparisons and parallels to some of the characters of the original Macross (who are al great, but extremely numerous) are also great. Even if one of them in particular faces a rather tragic death. Leon, is a total snake, and so is Grace, but despite how brutal and messed up they are, they make for entertaining backstabbers. \\n\\n\r\nART: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nLet`s get the bad out of the way. In the early portions of the show, there are a few moments where the animation quality dips, and no where is this more apparent in the chase scene in episode 10, where it looks like utter ass. And this was done by Studio Satelight. For most of the rest of the normal scenes, they look fine for `08 standards. Then, the concert and fight scenes. The CG mechs look incredible, and the action scenes look beautiful and epic, and get increasingly awesome over the course of the show. The concert scenes are full of flashing stage lights, great digital visuals and costumes, and awesome lighting. If it weren`t for the occasional dips in animation quality in the first half of the show, this section would likely be a 10.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you know about Macross, then you`d know that it`s known for three things. Mech fights, syncretic blending of cultures, and of course, music. Particularly, music that`s supposed to help put the conflict to an end, and give our heroes to keep fighting when their back`s against the wall. Gabriella Robin aka Yoko freakin' Kanno had a hand in the soundtrack, which explains why this OST is so amazing. May `N (voice of Sheryl) and who ever voices Ranka Lee both do some stellar vocals, and both the concert scenes, and the OPs and EDs reflect that. OP 1 is rather great, and sets up the tone for a lot of the first half. OP 2 (for episode 17 exclusively) is rather nice, even if it`s just a rehash of one of the recurring songs of the series. OP 3, is amazing. Done by both singers, the glittering sound effects, futuristic sounding instruments, the guitar, and the vocals, all blend together to create this amazing OP, and the visuals only compound this praise further. ED 1 is also great, and a good emotional piece, and the other endings, unfortunately don`t compare. However, some songs like Aimo, and a few others, along with some of the orchestral pieces, particularly that guitar bit at the preview of each new episode, are all great as well.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nMost of this series surprised me a how good it was (except for episode 8. 8 sucks) considering how bitter episode 1 made me feel. It was an epic blast from beginning to end, and if you can put up with CG and lyrical music in the middle of your battles, you`ll find tis as enjoyable as I did, or at least I hope. I also really enjoyed all the little nods to previous Macross shows like the original and Macross Zero (a prequel to the original), as well as the concert performances. It may not have made me feel as great watching it as most other installments, but it was still very fun regardless.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10   RAW SCORE: 79/100\\n\\n\r\nDespite a few narrative holes, and the mediocre beginning episode, and episode 8, I love this show, and I find it to be a must see for all Macross fans. It certainly doesn't beat or the original, or some of the other older installments lf the franchise, but it was a damn good ride regardless with a decent love triangle, lovely songs, and surpringly great aerial dogfight action. With that said, I bid you adieu.",

Traveling the Galaxy, Mecha fighters, Love Triangle, Unconventional weapons (Singing) and outstanding soundtrack.\r\nStory: Really great story but I knocked off a point because I feel they stuffed too many events into the last episode.  They should have done it over 2 episodes or made the 25th episode longer (like the De-culture extended 1st episode). I wish they also resolved the Love Triangle at bit better.\r\nArt: Fantastic CG effects and battle scenes with great shots all over.  Very little or no shots were \"repeated\" scenes.1 point off though because some character shots looked super deformed or poorly drawn. Different artists or rushing deadlines?\\n\\n\r\nSound: THE standard by which Anime soundtracks must be judged.  Few animes can compare to the complexity, originality, and just damn good listening of Macross.  And it all started with the legendary soundtracks of the Original Macross series.  Megumi Nakajima (Ranka's voice &amp; singing talent) is fantastic, coming out fresh and sweet like the character should be.  May'n (Sheryl's singing voice) also stuck me as a perfect match to Sheryl's personality as a hardcore performing and established diva.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Not entirely deep but overall good.  Nobody seemed like a useless unnecessary character.  I found Ranka's character to have the most life and biggest struggle.  Alto's personal struggles with his family seemed irrelevant.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Macross F will satisfy hardcore Macross fans and mainstream viewers alike.  It has enough drama &amp; action for casual viewers to enjoy but 50% is a lot of Nostalgia from SDF Macross, Macross 7, &amp; Macross Zero.  If this was a standalone series I probably would still have given it an 9 Overall.  But since I'm a fan of the series it gets that extra point for my personal satisfaction:)\\n\\n\r\nMaybe we will see new footage and closure when the compiled &quot;movie&quot; version is released.",

It's a whole new genre, combining intense mecha battles with intense singing.. \r\nThe first Macross series was more about relationships.. However, in Frontier, it has changed all that. The Valkyrie art is superb, the plot and setting is realistic, the music and songs, oh the songs are just too good to be true!!! The characters are amazingly interesting, cute and loveable too.. \r\nIn just 25 episodes, Macross Frontier has brought a whole new genre up front. It's a genre never before explored, not in Gundam, not in Evangelion, not even in FMP. \r\nIt makesit clear to us the strong relationship between culture, war, evolution and technology. \\n\\n\r\nOnly one word to describe this series overall : Deculture!!!\\n\\n",

Otherwise 8/10.\r\nFew people may read this review as it's almost literally at the bottom of the heap of reviews written for this series. But I have to get my opinion out there. this anime is way too overhyped. \r\nIt does a lot of good things. It's strong points include the overall story, the character development, the (very) atmospheric music, the artwork and the design of the world. In fact, up until episode 20 or so I really thought I had come across a masterpiece worthy of a 10/10 rating. I even considered going and downgrading someof my other anime because this one raised the bar for me.\\n\\n\r\n--  SPOILERS BEGIN  -- Warning: Rant mode = ON\\n\\n\r\nAnd then the anime brought out all its negatives. The series conclusion is stale, generic and a cliche of mecha anime that really has no place in a project of this ambition, that is otherwise quite unique and well-thought out. The ending is lazy writing at best; uninspired insipid plagiarism at its worst. The villain was well-thought out and her defeat is due to several deus-ex machinae that really frustrated me. I marathoned this anime and expected a good conclusion because the beginning was good and the story progression was stellar. For the anime to let me down at the 20 episode mark was horribly disheartening. \\n\\n\r\nI was even a bit impressed by how the MC had managed to choose between the two girls who vie for his attention. Right at the end I'm given a cliched harem rom-com situation that I never expected. Why? Just why? \\n\\n\r\nThe music which usually fit the mood of each episode really deteriorated towards the ending as well. All in all, the ending threw off the anime from a masterpiece to a cringe-fest. \\n\\n\r\n--End of SPOILERS --\\n\\n\r\nThis was a good anime and is worth watching but the ending is aggravatingly mediocre.",

I've seen all the Macross series from the original to Macross II, Macross Plus and Macross 7.  So I had pretty high expectations going in.    On some parts my expectations were met, but on others they weren't.\r\nThe story was very good.  Taking place after the war with the Zentradi who they now coexist with.  The plot started off really good with the appearance of a mysterious race called the Vajra.  Sadly though the story/plot slowly goes down hillfrom there.  The problem could be there weren't really interesting characters, but I'll get that in a moment.  The climax story was a total mess and didn't make any sense. The Vajra turned out to be almost pointless to the story.  The ending was just a plan let down.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the worst part of the series.  You or at least for me won't care for almost any of the characters.  Alto was decent, but he came off as boring, he just had no back story or charisma.  Ranka for some reason just got on my nerves.  She wasn't much of a lead character.  There were only a few I liked.  Sheryl who was great character with a real story shouldn't have wasted her time on Alto.  Also Michael who seemed to be the only real man in this anime.  He had a  great ending which I loved.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation by Satelight was brilliant.  One of the best things about the anime.  The way the animated everything from the characters to the battles were great.\\n\\n\r\nThe music as usual for a Robotech/Macross series was amazing.  I even downloaded the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nSadly this series just didn't live up to my expectations.  Was it still a good series.. yes just not on the level of Robotech, Macross, Macross Plus or Macross II.",

            "content": "At this point, a true Macross series had not come out since the mid-90s. This time, fairly new Studio Satellite without much prior success got the task for Macross Frontier. This is where the series truly takes a turn away from the mechs and makes the full transition to idols. A bonus was the role of director was shared between the experienced Yasuhito Kikuchi and the famous Transformers designer Shoji Kawamori. Where the Macross franchise was successful in the past, it was quickly established that Frontier is no Plus and certainly no Super Dimensional and more towards Macross 7 with more emphasis on female idolsinstead of a band.\\n\\n\r\nOnly 50 years have passed since the alien invasion of the first Macross, but from the show, the viewer could guess centuries. Macross Frontier takes place primarily on an immigration fleet ship traveling through space in search of a new frontier. Life is normal for our two main characters. Alto Saotomi is the typical male anime blank slate with a teenage angst personality while the other is Ranka Lee whom is a petit quarter alien ambitious future idol. All is well until the super pop idol known as Sheryl Nome visits their ship and all of a sudden a dangerous alien lifeform known as the Vajra attack. Naturally, Ranka becomes an idol to fight through singing and Alto becomes a fighter pilot, so all the Macross elements are in place, plus a love triangle that totally is not frustrating or confusing at all (sarcasm).\\n\\n\r\nDoes this series have much to do with the focus on aliens like other Macross shows? Instead, the show wants to focus on the development of our three characters and coming to terms with their own identities, pasts, and future. This can make for excellent storytelling, but Frontier just does not have the writing and dynamics to make it character driving and ends up focusing too much on being plot driven instead. Frontier is its own standalone series and separates itself enough where watching other Macross shows are not needed.\\n\\n\r\nEach of our three main characters have their own quirks. Alto is extremely selfish and is the complete opposite to both Ranka and Sheryl. For some reason, both the girls fall for him. Alto does compliment the otherwise predictable personalities of the two girls though. The romance and plot are extremely slow paced and never seems to go anywhere until the Vajra makes them. It can get quite irritating. The show also makes all the effort it can to have a little 2008 touch like most anime of the time: a little bishounen, school life, some shoujo undertones, and more. \\n\\n\r\nMusic does not falter in any way. An extremely strong unique soundtrack matches the action and drama occurring. Kanno Yoko and Nakajima Megumi\u2019s debut happening for the show just adds to the level of where the show could have been. Animation and art is all over the place though. It can be stellar at times, while be incredibly terrible from non-moving backgrounds to off-set character models. Not to mention the CGI which is certainly a bit off-putting during action scenes. Sure, the second half of the show picks up and gets super \u201cout there\u201d and makes extreme leaps for plot progression. Worst of all though is the blatant disregard for character development and climax moments the series lead up to. This is where Macross Frontier drops a heavy ball (plot magic).\\n\\n\r\nIs Macross Frontier worth watching? Compared to past Macross shows, the jury would have to say no. Is Macross Frontier fine? Yeah, the show is ok and definitely has something in the show other than the name Macross: action, romance, fan service, plot; there is something. When the best character is considered a third wheel while the other two don\u2019t really do much for an engaging story, Macross Frontier might be worth skipping unfortunately.",

            "content": "25 years after the original Macross (OK, probably more like 20), Shoji Kawamori says \"Huh, we haven't done Macross in a while. Let's make it a spectacle.'\r\nI tried to slog through the original Macross, and it felt like trying to slog through Gundam or Zeta Gundam. They're good shows, the mechs are outstanding for their time, etc., but if you want to get an idea of the story, watch the movie adaptations. Do You Remember Love is a work of art, and it's one of the few Macross works you can legally obtain in North America (assuming it's not sold out) thanks to legal shenanigansby Harmony Gold.\\n\\n\r\nMacross Plus took that a step further and introduced a glimpse of the musical mastermind known as Yoko Kanno. From electronic synth to a roaring orchestral march, the only downside to the well-choreographed and animated tour de force is the fact that it only had 4 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nMacross 7, I managed to finish, and Basara is certifiably insane. This one tried to take Macross in the rock band direction with mixed results. Dynamite 7 continued the story, and I got to hear Angel Voice, which was awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThen the prequel, Macross Zero, introduced us to the emo hero (we'll get to him). but be honest, you wanted to watch this for Roy Fokker. They tried to introduce a mythos to the series that never got touched on since, and Pacific islanders singing in French... Uh, sure. Why not.\\n\\n\r\nThe VF-25 looks sort of like a cross between a YF-19 and a Sukhoi Su-27, with the swing wings of a VF-1. In other words, she's a sexy aircraft. You can have my alloy model when you pry it from my cold dead hands.\\n\\n\r\nRemember the dogfight scene in the Macross Plus finale? One scene in the first episode is like that, but with moar pew pew lasers. It seems Kawamori saw the Star Wars prequels and decided that space battles must have tons of special effects. Now, battles like these are stunning to watch, and with Yoko Kanno's \"The Target\", who needs characters and dialogue? Yeah, couple of problems: There's only so much lasers the audience can grasp at any one time. A lot of the combat in both the Star Wars prequels and Macross F is sensory overload. Second problem: Kanno borrowed a bit too liberally from John Williams; the trumpet riffs sound like what I like to call the \"Rebel Alliance fanfare\". In the recap scenes in early episodes, the soundtrack is beautiful, but sounds like Andrew Lloyd Webber. At least she didn't copy the melodies wholesale, but I think her musical style was better expressed in Escaflowne, Turn-A Gundam, and Macross Plus. We get a taste in \"Test Flight Delight\". That said, Kanno outdid herself with this soundtrack, which is her best work since Aquarion; naturally, she also wrote every song in the show, because you gotta have tons of songs.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of \"who needs characters and dialogue\", here's the rub with the show. The characters are at best all right. I watched the entire series for one reason, and that's Ranka Lee (Kira!). Alto Saotome came off as a rehash of Macross Zero's male lead, and Sheryl Nome was all right but not my cup of tea. Ranka was fun to watch, her songs were fantastic (her commercials were hilarious), and her character's journey had me at the edge of my seat. Alto, well, sometimes I just wanted to punch him; thankfully Ozma took care of that for me.\\n\\n\r\nOne weakness of the Macross series is, either the hero begins as a savant combat pilot, or begins as a complete noob but by episode 16 or so he's stunningly competent and you're left wondering why. I'd like to see the progression from A to Z here (maybe it was shown with Hikaru in the first series), but perhaps that requires a level of storytelling that Satelight lacks.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of storytelling, after the initial concert and combat, our characters go to... school. After bringing the action to a screeching halt there, the story seems to head off in random directions. At times they go to a film shoot at the beach because hey, we gotta promote Macross Zero, at times they're delivering a concert to some Zentradi because Kira!! The story only moves in some coherent direction during the final arc of the show, like Aquarion before it. In fact this is the formula Satelight appears to settle on for its flagship shows, with varying degrees of meh. Maybe hire an actual writer, fellas?\\n\\n\r\nTo recap: Good visuals and action, sexy new VF, sublime soundtrack and songs. Bad news: if you don't like Ranka or Sheryl and you want to punch Alto, stick to the action scenes.",

            "content": "This won't be a masterpiece of a review, but this was definitely a masterpiece of an anime.  \r\nStory:  This is a continuation of the themes from previous Macross's.  As before, the story revolves around a space struggle for the future of the human race against an alien \"aggressor,\" but as usual, there is a deeper plot occuring than anyone originally understands.  Like previous Macross installations, this anime also revolves largely around music.  The story is deep and complex, but still easily understandable.  The anime does not run out of plot at any point in time, and does not gobat-#$&* insane in the last quarter of the anime to make up for having no story left like many others, especially in the sci-fi genre.  \\n\\n\r\nArt:  The visuals were stunning on a level I don't recall ever seeing in an anime before.  They were both beautiful and incredibly high quality.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  This being Macross, the story in a large part revolves around singing as a means for peace.  As you might expect in such a situation, the music is incredible and is used throughout the anime, both as background material and as the primary focus of some scenes.  Macross is as much a musical as a sci-fi series...and its great!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  Without spoiling things too much, the characters are perfect.  They act as they should, with the evil characters being manipulative and conniving, adroitly attempting to bring their ends to fruition without the usual stupid and illogical failings that you find in many other animes.  The protagonists fight for their principles, and Macross does a great job of making you feel what they feel, from the relationships between them to the sorrow when one is lost.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  Macross will grab you at the start, keep you up all night watching, then leave you feeling great after it's over.  It's simple...Macross kicks ass.",

            "content": "To this day, I have not written any reviews so far, but I do not regret writing one for Macross Frontier, which was so far the most memorable series that I've watched.\r\nI am not a fan of sci-fic anime, and I could describe it as a genre that I avoid the most. However, Macross Frontier most certainly distinguishes itself from all other.\r\nThe story was very well written and I felt the series has alot more meaning to it than what it appears to be. It seems to convey a deep message about the real world, and I think that these sort of shows are themost meaningful to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was quite impressive. However, at times it feels that the colors were a bit over done. But overall I was satisfied by the effort that was put in in terms of art.\\n\\n\r\nSound effects were nicely done. I just hook up my surround sound speakers and it feels like I am in the middle of a space war. But it is still excellent without the speakers. The music in my perspective was absolutely flawless and all of the songs fits the show quite well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design was quite excellent. I have become immensly attracted to Ranka Lee right after her first appearance in the series. Character developemnt of all other characters were also nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, I totally enjoyed myself while watching this series. I find myself craving for more after each and every episode and it was quite sad for me to see it all end.\\n\\n\r\nI've rarely given any show, let alone sci-fic show much praise in the past. But Macross Frontier definitely deserve my praise. Overall a 10/10 from me for this series.",

            "content": "I'm very new to the Macross World, but I thought I'd give it a go. Kawamori's strangely loose canonical lineage seemed like it would be a fun area to watch unfold in canon and fanon. \r\nSound: It's Macross. Music is going to be there and it's going to be important. I really enjoyed the soundtrack. The vocals and songs (pretty much all dealing with romantic metaphors and analogies) are really well placed, well sung, and beautifully crafted. To me, nothing ever seemed overly repetitive despite using the same material often. The in and out music during mecha battles was fun and really enhanced the scenes.\r\nArt:It was a pretty wonderfully done anime series. There were occasionally oddly shaped hands and feet and clumsy panning out work, but the visuals I was in it for (the planet environments and the space battles) were gorgeous and amazing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Most people know that the anime involves a Love Triangle before going into it. It was well done. Both heroines were likeable (maybe even more than the hero) and any shipping factions that are and were slinging mud at one another sadly miss out on a chance to see interesting characters. The 'side characters' are awesome. Omza Lee, Michael, Klan Klang, pretty much any SMS character stole the spotlight as many do in anime series. The motives, the backgrounds, some of it wasn't on par with the other positives of the series, but nothing was so bad. Fanservice, of course.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Macross Mecha meets Ender's Game extraterrestrials. If you like either, the 'shounen' part of the series will appeal to you. Again, the love triangle is handled well. Looking (but not having watched) the first Macross, it seems to follow some of the archetypes and vibes that specific Macross held. Since it's a continuity of the Macross world, knowledge of past series will make this one very enjoyable with all the nods given to Macross history. The story had its ups and downs for me. To keep rounded interest, many story lines have in and out sequencing-we'll get something with Ranka's life, pause it, go to Sheryl's, pause it, go to a battle, etc. It kept everything flowing well, but also highlighted which storylines I cared little for (there were around 3 or 4 minor ones). Some very poignant and hard-hitting lines, a few close calls where you think they did, but 'yes!' they didn't-it definitely makes for an enjoyable anime experience. I also cried once and thought quite a few parts were full of total badassery. \\n\\n\r\n-That covers the anime generally, this part is more of a specific experience analysis; deals with shipping...you've been warned-\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is the sort of funny part. My first encounter with Macross Frontier came from an avid fan who happened to obsessively love AltoxRanka and at one point declared that ship to be canonically proven as true. Not ever having touched the story myself I thought it a pretty interesting thing to see what happens to a person as their ship goes from fanon to confirmed. I came into Macross expecting Alto and Ranka to have a confirmed ending relationship. I fell for Ranka and Shirley. Both are awesome (so are many of the other females in the series). And whatever you ship more power to you. Obviously I didn't get the ending I expected, but I definitely got an awesome experience. Watching my expectations axis tilt was something I've really never felt before. I wasn't actively for or against either pairing in the canon, but the romance was done elegantly. And not just with the main triangle. Well, there were a few bumps but I have sort of low expectations for romance in shounen that I happen to enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nDefinitely worth watching, especially for the music and mecha explosion porn.",

            "content": "Story: Passing over the ending, this was a cute story without being too silly or irrelevant feeling. The backdrop of space travel and war, kept the character drama from getting over the top, so it was enjoyable rather than too trite, though it was not spectacularly original. It was interesting to see music wedded to science fiction in this way. I was not pleased with the ending, though I will not spoil it. Endings tend to color my view of a story quite a lot, but, I tried not to let it interfere too much since I was eager to watch this story unfold.\r\nArt: Theart was pretty good. I don't have anything specific to say about it really, but, its not like it wasn't enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Music was a large part of this show which was very nice, though as the two of the main characters are pop stars if you hate pop it might be harder to enjoy the sound of this show. I absolutely love &quot;Aimo&quot; and enjoyed the different singers and their tunes changing things up.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters were not extraordinarily developed, but sufficiently so to understand them (with the exception of Grace). I did not enjoy the main characters as much as the supporting characters, though, Sheryl did grow on me slightly toward the end. There was fair amount of Ranka hatred on veoh, which, I can't say I really understood, but, I do think she has the potential to annoy people who dislike naive, innocent, sensitive and defenseless characters. But that put them off her, not the show. Just as Sheryl's initial appearance put me off her, not the show. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed this show enough to be impatient for the next episode, though not as much as I was for the next code geass. I was very interested to see this show unfold on the both the personal level (yay love triangles) and the larger level (good old fate of the human race).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Its hard to make an overall comment because that includes the ending, which I found dreadfully unsatisfying. Still, I do not regret watching the show and enjoyed it along the way. But, if you are looking for mecha battles and sci-fi with music and some good old fashioned teenage drama, this show certainly delivers.",

And then I wanted to keep watching the secuels and, after Macross Plus ( this one is pretty good), I watched this.\r\nI'm trying so hard to describe with words how much disappointed I am with the work they done over here.\r\nThis anime was made in 2007 - 2008. We are talking about 10 years after the other Macross show (Macross 7), and there is a very high jump in animation improvement, but, it seems that, that much that they improved in animation, they lost it in imagination.\r\nIn Macross Frontier we can see the sameapproach, with the same 2 Heroines, secondary characters that don't contribute so much to the history.\\n\r\nWe can see in, all the serie along, how the it trys to \"Looks like Macross SDF\". Apporting that fanservice that even gonnes wrong all time.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, other thing that pissed me off are the songs. \\n\\n\r\nIn Macross, the voice, the sing of the heroine is one of the most important factors, and the way of transmit feelings to the viewer, BUT! There are so many ways to do it.\\n\\n\r\nHere, the song didn't transmit the feeling that you were looking for if you come from Macross SDF. Here, the songs are just OST, putted there to make the viewer like them forced with an Idol half naked. You can't In any moment that the singer its feeling the song, even you cant feel it, its so sad.\\n\\n\r\nThe Episode Distribution:\\n\\n\r\nThere was also an other point of the show that annoyed me so much is, how \"heavy\" were the episodes, It's like the episode tries so hard to tell so many things, so many story lines, and made it so hard to swallow, ( and, in the end you realize that all was pointless.)\\n\\n\r\nI won't recomend this anime show to noboddy that enjoyed Macross SDF, just for not destroy their illusions like mines. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Both of the lead girls get their own pieces, sing duets and perform each other's songs on multiple occassions, and the songs are used to spectacular effectas BGMs in the middle of important scenes (particularly Diamond Crevasse).\\n\\n\r\nMacross is, despite the mecha combat, a relationship drama at heart, so it's fortunate that this is reasonably well developed. The characters grow and change in logical ways and there's a lot of attention paid to both their strengths and their flaws. Not just the central love triangle, though - all the supporting characters get their chance to shine.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not a lot of resolution in the overarcing plot - it's fairly predictable and some of the background was not resolved in the end, but overall it doesn't make that much of an impact on enjoyment of the show, particularly with the sheer amount of awesome packed into the final episode. If you're a fan of the Macross franchise, there are any number of little references and easter eggs to find.\\n\\n\r\nMacross Frontier is a very pretty package with actual substance, and while it's a little slow at times, is overall a very enjoyable performance and addition to the series.",

            "content": "Macross frontier is probably the most over-rated anime of all time.  There are plenty of animes miles better then frontier.  If you haven't watched much anime then macross frontier will seem awesome.  But if you've been watching anime since the 80's it's a huge step down.  I found Heroic age and Gundam seed much more interesting then any of the bland stuff you'll find in frontier.\r\nThe problem with frontier is that it drags its plot out for too many episodes, there's just not enough interesting in the show to carry the hopelessly senseless story.\r\nIf there is one thing frontier suffers fromit's being generic and trying to imitate (poorly) what made the original macross series so popular.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is Japans obsession with shoe-horning songs of j-pop stars into space opera.  In frontier it just doesn't fit well at all with how they implemented it.  The problem is that they do more then just have a singing pop star in the show but use the pop stars voice as a plot device to defeat the bad guys.  I'm sorry to say it but this is just amateur level storytelling here.  The whole plot is simple and comes off completely campy towards the end of the series making you feel like you wasted your time.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is that the characters are just not believable.  For instance the main character and his love interest is written poorly and exists on a level of uninteresting blandness that I haven't seen in a long time.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother problem is the characters have no depth and so you can't really identify with them at all, so you never feel in any way immersed or connected to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with macross frontier is that it is corporate soul-less remake with no genuine heart and soul.  The originals had way more soul then frontier can ever hope to have.",

            "content": "&ldquo;Macross Frontier&rdquo; is a mecha sci-fi series meant to celebrate 25 years of &ldquo;Macross&rdquo; anime and bring all the different &ldquo;Macross&rdquo; series together.\r\nAs such all of the typical Macross elements are present, veritech fighters (transforming from airplane to robot form and back), giant spaceships and space battles, young men dreaming of soaring the skies, the many faces of being a popular songstress, from being discovered to becoming the people's idol and even saviour.\r\nAs a celebratory series that aims to bring all the previous series together &ldquo;Macross Frontier&rdquo; is rife with references to the other series, with explicit plot references, obvious links or Easter eggs. Whileviewers who have seen the other &ldquo;Macross&rdquo; series will be able to enjoy all these references and possibly gain a better understanding, anyone without prior knowledge about the other &ldquo;Macross&rdquo; series will be able to follow and enjoy &ldquo;Macross Frontier&rdquo;. The key plot elements necessary to follow the series and its premise are sufficiently explained so no one is lost as to what is happening. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in &ldquo;Macross Frontier&rdquo; were quite good, most were sufficiently three dimensional and not merely generic characters. Next to the man characters Alto, Ranka and Sheryl who were all complex enough, a good ensemble of their supporting cast were fleshed out well enough to become quite interesting as well, especially Michael, Klan and Luca. Other characters like Nanase, Brera and Ozma were alas more typical characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs the first opening song's title &ldquo;Triangular&rdquo; suggests, &ldquo;Macross Frontier&rdquo; features a love triangle between the main characters Alto, Ranka and Sheryl. It is done quite well and brought on screen during the entire series' run. While there are hints of a lot of possible drama and suffering that comes with such a situation, the final episode leaves things more open on a positive note. While it's a nice ending, the chance to conclude with some really gripping dramatic storytelling is missed, and seeing the painful elements of their love triangle are often brought forth throughout the series, this is a shame. Nonetheless, the final episode definitely has its charm and hits the mark.\\n\\n\r\nHaving two songstresses with Sheryl -the established and widely popular artist- and Ranka -the new upcoming refreshingly innocent starlet- leads to a unique dynamic that allows for many poignant scenes and plot possibilities which the series makes good use of. Add to that each has their own distinct personality and troublesome past they must discover and overcome, they prove to be entertaining characters.\\n\r\nAlto may seem to be a more common male lead, he's often hot headed and seems to fail making any progress in his relationships with Sheryl or Ranka, but the manner in which his motivations and goals are ultimately portrayed make him less generic after all. As for him not making a definite choice between Sheryl or Ranka, while it's implied he may have deeper feelings for both, his goal was always to live his own life so he foregoes any decision even if that has others accuse him of just acting and trying to please everyone. Aiming to not hurt either since he holds them both dear, both Sheryl and Ranka are important people to him who motivated him and helped him get to his goal. So paradoxically Alto ends up holding both Sheryl and Ranka close to him, while at the same time keeping them at a distance.\\n\\n\\n\r\n&ldquo;Macross Frontier&rdquo; squeezes enough other (sub)plots in, from the battle of survival against the Vajra, the relationship between humans and Zentraedi, the different evolutions people must make, experiencing and overcoming loss, political intrigue,... most are handled well, be they small or spanning multiple episodes.\\n\r\nTowards the end of the latter half of the series, the pace picks up and the atmosphere slightly darkens, themes such as survival, genocide, the pain of loving and losing are brought in a manner that's quite surprising and gives the series a more serious tone up until the final episodes. Especially when one of the more important characters dies, the sense of loss this means to the other characters and how it affects them is brought forth. This was however necessary as in the episodes before, the Macross inhabitants have already suffered serious losses and damage to their habitat ships but as none of the main cast were directly affected, it would feel distant to most viewers. Having a significant character disappear has a definite impact to illustrate the grave situation the cast find themselves in.\\n\\n\r\nThe final action packed episode brings nearly everything to a satisfactory conclusion. Seeing the celebratory character of &ldquo;Macross Frontier&rdquo; and the message of wanting to live on that permeates throughout the series, the end is very fitting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation in &ldquo;Macross Frontier&rdquo; alas suffered from being quite inconsistent, there could be a visible difference in animation quality between episodes or even between scenes. This was quite apparent due to the fact many scenes or full episodes have truly sublime animation, with gorgeously animated fast-paced action scenes and incredibly detailed characters with great shading and colouring. So when the animation level drops it often stuck out like a sore thumb. I doubt it would ruin the viewing experience for anyone, though most people will pick up on it and notice it.\\n\r\nRegardless of the animation quality drops here and there, &ldquo;Macross Frontier&rdquo; boasts some of the most intricate, flashy and lusciously animated mecha and space combat action scenes seen these recent years, for fans of that genre certainly not to miss.\\n\\n\\n\r\n&ldquo;Macross&rdquo; has always had music as a theme or plot device, accordingly the music in &ldquo;Macross Frontier&rdquo; is quite frankly fantastic, Yoko Kanno produces an awesome soundtrack filled with different styles, a real musical centipede with tracks that perfectly accentuate the events on screen. The opening, closing and insert songs are all good tunes and nearly all other known songs from previous &ldquo;Macross&rdquo; series are sung throughout the series. From the original opening songs &ldquo;Triangular&rdquo;, &ldquo;Lion&rdquo; , catchy pop/rock tunes full of energy to &ldquo;Diamond Crevasse&rdquo;, &ldquo;What 'bout my star&rdquo; and even the classic &quot;Ai Oboete Imasu ka&ldquo; and &quot;Watashi no Kare ha Pilot&rdquo; from earlier &ldquo;Macross&rdquo; series, all excellent music that adds to the series atmosphere and enjoyment.\\n\r\nFor those interested in soundtracks, the &ldquo;Macross Frontier&rdquo; original soundtrack is definitely worth it and quite pleasant to listen to by itself as well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAny &ldquo;Macross&rdquo; fan should check out this series but if you like mecha, action or space adventure, then you will surely enjoy &ldquo;Macross frontier&rdquo;, it's no doubt one of the best series of the spring/summer 2008 season.",

            "content": "Fun and very entertaining mecha series with a brilliant soundtrack.\r\nPLOT: Same premise of most Macross series \u2013 J-Pop saves the universe! However its so much more than that, as Macross Frontier has lots of nicely written dialogue and well thought out plot progressions. Sure its got a heap of clich\u00e9s, a rather standard love triangle and I could spot many of the plot twists coming a mile off thanks to my familiarity with this kind of series; but despite its faults Macross Frontier never failed to be interesting and entertaining. I loved the characters \u2013 they did start off fairly generic, but there was lotsof character development and they are all very memorable. It\u2019s the kind of show that just wants to entertain you and I was definitely entertained.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: Its obvious that Macross F had a huge budget \u2013 there is not a single scene that isn\u2019t animated beautifully. Tons of work went into this series; the animation is fluid, the character designs distinctive and well thought out, and the background detailing breathtaking. The action set pieces are something else \u2013 massive Valkyrie battles with ridiculous amounts of beam spamming just leapt out of the screen and demanded your attention. Yay for explosions! Use of CGI was extensive, but this is a rare example of how the use of CGI enhances the animation to perfection \u2013 its an extremely pretty anime.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC: Thankfully for a series based on J-Pop the soundtrack is nothing short of brilliant. I\u2019ve both OSTs downloaded and they feature quite highly on my playlists \u2013 although I generally prefer Sheryl\u2019s songs to Ranka\u2019s. The songs are used to great effect in the show, enhancing fight scenes and adding a musical quality to some of the more s'life orientated scenes. The background score is also fantastic. The ever-changing OPs & EDs are great and I don\u2019t think I ever skipped over the OP & ED for any of the 25 episodes!\\n\\n\r\nVOICE ACTING: One of the 1st things I actually noticed was the stellar cast this show has! So many well-known seiyuu in one show was just the icing for the Inner Fangirl; I mean you\u2019ve got Tomoya, Kamina, Watanuki, Tieria, Miyuki, Kagura and Belldandy all in one show!!\\n\\n\r\nIn case you haven\u2019t noticed by now I loved this show \u2013 granted I\u2019m quite biased as I really like this genre, but Macross Frontier really is a great example and I\u2019d quite happily rewatch it!",

            "content": "Story & Characters:\r\nUnfortunately for me, this is a classic anime lacking the substance to meet the style. I really tried to like the three main characters (Sheryl, Alto and Ranka) but I found none of them engaging. I struggled to care for their plight and whilst the plot honors the previous Macross series, there is an over reliance on knowing the history. If you have never seen Macross before, I highly recommend watching the others before taking on this series. In the end, it was the supporting characters that I found interesting (Mikhail, Clan Clang, Ozma etc) and I kind of wish there was moredevelopment for them. However, this would go against the love-triangle formula that centers on the three main protagonists. Of the three, Sheryl is the only one with any layers to her personality. I found I just wanted to shake some sense into Alto and Ranka as any attempt at depth was instead replaced by grumpiness/chip-on-his-shoulder (Alto) or reliant-on-song (Ranka). For the majority the plot unfolds at a snail's pace and the double-dealing and political power plays are lost amongst the concert songs and stagnating dialogue. The somewhat faceless alien enemy \"Vajra\" are explored as almost a side-plot and did not evolve on any real scale compared to previous alien encounters in other Macross series (e.g. the Zentradi). Unfortunately for me, no amount of animated brilliance can cover up a plot that fails to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis is where most of my score lies. The animation is second to none and the battle scenes are off the \"eye-candy\" charts. It's an incredible face-lift from the original Macross series (not that I didn't enjoy the original series) and should please all fans in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music is the core of this series. Fans looking for all-out sci-fi action should NOT watch this series. Music is the central theme of Macross and it is clearly obvious that the makers of Macross Frontier invested a lot of time and energy into developing the songs and concert scenes. However, for me there was almost too much focus placed on song. The songs also do not particularly appeal to my tastes but those who follow the Oricon charts avidly should enjoy the music. The sound effects are top notch and easily match the awe-inspiring action sequences, which are unfortunately far and few between. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment / Overall:\\n\r\nI would recommend this only for die-hard Macross fans, those who have seen the previous incarnations of this anime or those into J-pop music. For those who have never seen any Macross series before, I imagine they'll be impressed by the animation but will not be able to connect to the story or characters.",

It suffers from a number of problems:\r\n- The enemy is a major letdown. For much of the series aliens just randomly appear, make mayhem, get taken out, then rinse and repeat. There's no plan, no overall objective, we never learnt their origin, only a half-baked reason to attack (that we learnt only in the final part) and no build up oftension. Unlike the original where the enemy had their own culture, objectives, and are actually beings that viewers can sympathise with, The enemy of Macross F are there to showoff the CGIs of space dogfight. Even then they fail due to the large amount of replayed footage and pitiful number of designs (I counted about 5, with 2 type that's used for 80% of the scenes). \\n\\n\r\n- The characters are developed poorly or too late. Alto as the main is somewhat interesting at the start but stalled due to lack of growth. Unlike Hikari the prototype Macross protagonist who as the series progressed became a larger than life figure burdened by the weight of destiny, Alto remains a teenager in a variable fighter.\\n\\n\r\nRanka when singing is powerful.

I feel she would be better off not as the love interest of Alto, as she's simply not girlfriend material. \\n\\n\r\nSheryl is the 'meatiest' - (pun unintendedl) out of the 3 leads, who I came to cheer and symphasis with, through most of her struggles are somewhat detached from the main plot, robbing a sense of legitimacy. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting casts are the typical sterotypes (or staples?) of the Macross world.\\n\\n\r\n- Macross Heritage:\\n\r\nWhilst paying homage to the Macross series is important, basing entire eposides on such pilgrims sometimes weakens the core premise of the current series. Somewhere in the middle, the story lost its way when episodes after episode becomes a homage to a previous series, with a sprinkle of plot development as an extra. What should've been garnish became the main, so to speak. Too often, episodes walk a fine line between tasteful homage and pandering, when it needn't be this forced. A good thing then that the direction is generally skilled, able to weave sometimes jarring elements into the show with few seams. Die hard Macross fans will be pleased.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\r\nOverall, Macross Frontier is a comprehensive reboot of the Macross franchise, the full season format allows something OVAs (Macross Zero, I'm looking at you) cannot achieve. Die hard Macross fans may enjoy the countless references and homages paid to the franchise, otherwise it is still enjoyable in its own right though the quality of story telling vary.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So here is my review of Macross Frontier , and I hope you all enjoy it and find it useful to you if you ever decide to watch this anime c :\r\nSo the story line.\r\nIt was a really good story line actually , and I'm pretty sure all lot of people have been going around saying now that ' OHAY WE'RE GONNA GET ATTACKED BY ALIENS IN 2012 INSTEAD OF BEING EXPLODED ' because of that whole ' end of the world ' crap. But , in the anime having earth attacked by aliens is probably an original thing when it comes to that sci-fistuff that a lot of people enjoy. But what I love about this anime they shove mechs and the alien stuff together and you see many battle scenes and of course , humans going through space. The story has a good thing with it though and it has a lot of things you wont expect yet will expect since some of the stuff gets kind of obvious in a way. Now with the whole story is also kind of original since humans are trying to find a place to live at instead of being up in space for all the time. But it also gives a reason for the story to go on , especially since they are trying to get away from these creatures Vajra. Which are also mech creatures who bring out guns too randomly and start killing everybody. NOW THAT WAS A TWIST. And then with the end of the story , thank the lord , it wasn't something stupid or just irritating. It was a perfectly normal happy ending and I liked it that way too , but they also kind of left it open in the end with the two main girls talking about the challenge that they will not back down from singing or love , meaning that , they are both continuing going to try and get Alto's love. So for story , I give it a 10 / 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt , it was alright.\\n\r\nJust sometimes with the flashes and such and explosions , it got a bit to crazy. Yea yea , I know it's a mech anime there needs to be explosions , well I'm not really a mech anime person so I guess thats why I'm kinda all ' meh ' on it. But also some things just looked . . . a bit off and odd but there wasn't too much of that and plus , they really needed to work on Sheryl. I have no idea about anyone else , but she looked like a lady with a man's face. I'm not even joking. To me they should have fixed that up , sure there was some parts where she did look like a female but she mainly looked like a male female thing. So it gets a 9 / 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound , sound is always perfect my goodness.\\n\r\nThe voice actors were picked out perfectly for all the characters , they did a brilliant job with it. And they did good sound effects too , really sound should always get a 10 / 10. Unless if there is horrible voice actors that make you wanna rip out your hair , then sure , give it a low score.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. 8 / 10.\\n\r\nOne reason. I hate Sheryl and Alto.\\n\r\nI really could care less what all those little fangirls and fanboys can say out there but I personally , do not like them at all. I hate them. Sheryl is just some stupid chick and Alto is some stupid boy out there with their hormones going crazy. While poor Ranka is being neglected a lot and I thought this was suppose to be a ' love triangle ' . Yea WHERE IS THAT LOVE TRIANGLE ? Because to me , it just seems just pure Alto x Sheryl to me. Then I also hate how they started to treat Ranka too , really it just irked me. Ranka met Alto first and they became buddies and then Alto just suddenly threw all his attention to Sheryl once she came in. Which is why I'm pretty sure theres a lot of Brera x Ranka fans out there. They all went to THAT pairing instead of Alto since Alto is such an idiot. But personally I have to say I was excited when Brera came in. Really he looked pretty kick ass , and awesome so I got pretty excited when he came in. Though with the twist of his background , that was kind of seen coming with his relation toward Ranka , which I will not say and you guys will have to go watch it to figure out yourself to see what it is. But really , I kinda got really angry when they killed off a awesome character and then another person too. Really , what was the point of killing them ? Well except for the one dude that got killed by Leon , that was understandable. BUT THE OTHER GUY ?\\n\r\nNGH.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment , 9 / 10.\\n\r\nMainly 9 / 10 because of Sheryl and Alto since I hate them with a firey passion. But I didn't let them get in the way of my enjoyment with the anime. But then again I'm also not a mech anime fan person so that effected it also. But then again it was really a mech anime to me , just space ships. I was really expecting some more gundams in there but there really wasn't , just plain space ships , flying around.\\n\\n\r\nOver all , 8 / 10.\\n\r\nPersonally I think they need to work on Alto and Sheryl more , and make them less annoying. They really bring down the whole fun of the anime because they are just both so stupid. And , I think these are just one of those not really ' mech ' animes just a sci-fi anime. One , because theres all these different alien creatures in there , they are looking for a new planet to live on , and they are fighting aliens all the bloody time. Sure it is a bit of a mech anime but not really. Seriously though , I think this would be a good anime for those people who don't really love mech animes , this would be a perfect one for you guys.\\n\\n\r\nWell theres my review , and I hope it was useful and enjoyable for you c :",

            "content": "I've started watching Macross Frontier on Saturday. I've finished it on the same day. I haven't done that in a while. Here are the reasons\r\n1. Story\r\nThe story develops gradually, and in a way that simply does not allow you to feel uninterested. In itself it is not profound or very original (esp. having in mind the first series), but it is still interesting enough to make you want to watch 'just one more episode'. I love the way the story combines the relationships between the characters and the war being fought for the salvation of the human race, stranded in deep space. \r\n2. Animation/fight scenes\r\nThere'sa lot of CGI in this series. Normally I detest CGI, but the one in Macross Frontier is superb and its use in the fight scenes is really great. Characters are nicely drawn, nothing out of the ordinary,I would just mention Sheryl Nome as the best animated character in the anime.\\n\r\n3. Sound\\n\r\nThere's a lot of singing in Macross Frontier, so if you don't like that kind of anime, or if you are irritated by the constant singing, you won't like it. However, if you don't mind, you will fiind some beautiful songs, and some great animation in the performing department, which is most often combined with fight scenes. If you believe in the power of music, you're gonna love Macross Frontier.\\n\r\n4. Characters\\n\r\nCharacters in Macross are good. But what I absolutelly loved is the way their relationships develop along with the story. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it is an anime worth watching. It has great love stories, great songs, fight scenes and an interesting story.",

            "content": "This has only been my second exposure to an anime in the Macross franchise since seeing Do You Remember Love last year which I wouldn't call the best intro to Macross for me since the movie format makes plot and character developments too compressed for a grand plot such as this. So my viewing of Macross Frontier is more as an introduction to the mecha franchise than as a seasoned fan. While the show isn't perfect, I do have to admit it did entertain me for the surprising plot developments and quirky mix of pop idol music and mecha battles.\r\nBefore I get into my thoughtsof music, plot and characters, I'll first have to praise the show's best feature for it: the visuals. Macross Frontier made enough use of CG-animation in rendering the civilian ships and mechas which look slick on the eyes, blend in almost seamlessly with the hand-drawn character designs and the battles with said mecha move at a very fluid pace. There were rarely any occasions I found of sloppy visuals during the show's run. I'd easily consider the show to be one of the best-looking anime titles to recently come out of Japan.\\n\\n\r\nAs for plot developments, the show mixes focus between the love triangle involving Alto, Ranka, and Sheryl plus the conflict with the Vajra. Both storylines carry along enough twists in their developments as character storylines slowly unravel, a big conspiracy involving major figures in the pop music and political worlds, the influence of music on the Vajra and developments of the side characters. You do get enough sense of the past developments faced by the major characters (the love triangle trio) and the buildup to dealing with the Vajra and conspirators does make sense as you put together the pieces of foreshadowing hinted at throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nThen, there's also the whole mecha/ pop idol music mix with this series. The premise as a whole was a bit hard for me to take seriously at first since I found it a bit over-the-top for idols being that much of an influence in a space opera as I have been more used to more serious space operas like the Stars franchise and Toward the Terra. But over time, I had fun with the whole mix considering I eventually realized the show was just having fun with this mix and it did do well at easing the mood following the show's more serious moments. Speaking of pop idols, the seiyuu for Ranka and Sheryl also sing their own songs which are quite catchy with one of Ranka's songs being a major element to Macross Frontier's plot, though it can get a bit stale listening to the same songs from both girls over time as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some issues that I do have with the show that keep it from being perfect for me, mainly in the fact that the show leaves a number of plot elements dangling. The show doesn't bother to resolve many of its potential romantic developments, especially the love triangle the show was building up enough with Ranka, Alto and Sheryl. Some other vital plot threads like Sheryl's past and Alto coming to terms with his family issues were left unaddressed as well. Plus while her manipulations were clever, Grace's motives against the Macross fleet were a bit on the shallow side as I've seen plans of world domination for no real reason done enough times in fictions besides anime.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the issues I found with Macross Frontier's plotting, I did find the show to be a decent and more proper introduction to the Macross franchise than Do You Remember Love. With high-quality mecha fight scenes, the fun mix of mecha and pop idol music, and the twists in plot developments with the Vajra and conspiracy, it did make for a good watch.",

            "content": "This series is one of the very few shows that I have watched again and again just for the sheer enjoyment of it.\r\nIt's set in the Macross universe somewhere between Macross 7 and Macross Plus.  The premise is that humans have just recently survived their first contact with alien life forms and to avoid detailing the events of the original Macross saga, we'll just say that humanity was brought to the edge of extinction.  To ensure the survival of the species, humans have left earth in giant self-sustaining city convoy ships with the goal of colonizing other planets.  However, there is anotherspecies that is threatening the existence of the human race.  Frontier is one of the massive convoy fleets and the setting for this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe alien species that humanity now faces is very much like Blizzard's Zerg and they plague Frontier and other convoys.  The show revolves around several characters as they struggle to survive and find their paths.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the 25th anniversary series of the Macross saga and Macross Frontier is essentially a 'tip of the hat' to all of the other Macross shows and movies.  That being said, the story is an excellent stand-alone salute.  The viewer need have no prior knowledge of the original series, but it does add an extra level of enjoyment.  It's a mecha anime in the same way that an old western is a horse movie.  Unlike some other mecha shows, the Valkyrie and other machines are presented as nothing more than flashy tools that are used to overcome some trial rather than being part of the cast.  The story is a simple one and doesn't bog the viewer down with complex terms, sub-plots and sub-sub-plots, or massive loads of tech jargon that nobody cares about.  For this reason, it's very easy to pick up and fall in love with.  It also helps that the first three episodes are absolutely incredible and will have you glued to the screen.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters follow a similar pattern to the original Macross saga.  The protagonist is the stereotypical hot-head pilot who doesn't know what to do with himself, the older mentor, the bossy lieutenant, the grizzled veteran captain, the bridge-bunnies, and the protagonists two love interests (it wouldn't be Macross without a love triangle - it's even celebrated as the opening theme song, Triangular).  The show has a huge cast and is remarkably able to pull it off, letting you get to know each one and their motivations through the course of the show without doing massive shonen-style info dumps.  \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is fantastic and carries through from the intense combat scenes to the more simple, daily life shots.  The animation is very fluid through most of the show and the use of CG animation for the mecha is well done and rarely offends the eyes.  There are a couple of action scenes where the level of detail and animation drops, almost as if those scenes were forgotten and added in after the fact.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound... this is where the Macross series always shines and Frontier is no exception.  May'n and Nakajima Megumi perform most of the vocals (as well as voicing Sheryl Nome and Ranka Lee) and the rest is made up orchestral score and other instrumentals.  This is one of very few series for which I purchased the soundtracks.  Macross saga has always been heavily grounded in music and it shows through in Frontier.\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't already figured it out, I very much enjoyed this show and I highly recommend it.  I would almost recommend this show as a primer to the rest of the Macross series as there are so many little bits and pieces of all of the Macross titles that preceded it sprinkled in.",

            "content": "Story 7: Humans vs bugs. Macross Frontier is a straight-forward yet very enjoyable sci-fi mecha tale of a wandering human space colony that encounters a race of deadly enemy space bugs. There is some intrigue but the conflict is mainly centered around action. The plot hits a lot of familiar notes but generally manages to avoid annoying cliches. Chances are this anime will remind you of something you've already watched before but in a good way. For me it was very satisfying-i.e. A solid Action/Romance with a coherent plot.\r\nArt 9: The art had a very professional and polished feel to it. Many of the landscapeslook almost like watercolor paintings. I also noticed that the scenery and environments are drawn extremely brightly; it was just something that stood out to me. I found this style to contrast well with the darkness in the space battles. Maybe you'll see what I mean. I found the special effects in the CG space battles to be slick and visually stunning.Let me just say that they really, really love showing barrages of zig-zagging cluster rockets.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 11: Music is a the heart and soul of this anime. There's a new song/performance almost every episode and many of the fight scenes are juxtaposed with cutaways to a Sheryl/Ranka singing/dancing. If you have a problem with that then I recommend you not watch this anime as music and fighting are incredibly intertwined in this anime. I thought these songs were extremely catchy and captivating and gave Macross Frontier it's style. The \"Aimo Aimo\" theme is honestly one of the most hauntingly beautiful songs I've ever heard (Even if they play it 10 times per episode toward the end). If you are going to skip this anime at least youtube that song, it's awesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9: I thought the core characters were memorable and unique. I felt like Alto, Sheryl and Ranka really shined and their characters were built up very memorably and believably. I also liked the direction they took with Alto's past as an kabuki actor/actress lol. It was something I don't think I've seen before in a male lead and gave an otherwise headstrong protagonist a bit of an effeminate soft spot. The romance aspect of this anime is interesting. In certain anime you can smell the \"destined couple\" a mile away--you know exactly who the [insert name] x  [insert name] is. In this anime you don't. It's almost a little frustrating because unlike Shakugan no Shana where you want Yoshida, the extra wheel, to just die, in Macross Frontier both female rivals are quite likeable and interesting. If you're a fan of anime love triangles then this is an example of one done right.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall 7: Macross Frontier is like ordering Apple Pie at an expensive restaurant. It won't be a new sensation but you know it will be satisfying and good.\\n\\n\r\nViolence/Gore: not a lot. A few blood splatters here and there, nothing twisted. There was a lot of space ships getting blown to pieces though.\\n\r\nLove/Romance: Love triangle. The romance side is important in the story but it's mainly about choosing the right girl.\\n\r\nSex/Nudity: Haha. They find some pretty wacky scenarios to insert an \"nipple-less, nude-body silhouette.\"",

Not much to say, sort of cliched beginning, but they pull it off quite nicely.\r\nArt [6]:\r\nThe animation is great, the backgrounds are great, but I really can't give a higher score because the characters look sloppier than I'm used to and I don't like how almost every single female has an incredibly masculine face.\r\nSound [8]:\r\nSound is sound, the effects are good and fit the scene/mood.\r\nCharacter [8]:\r\nInteresting to watch, the characters develop over the story and you learn more about their pasts. None of them are boring.\r\nEnjoyment [9]:\r\nI would give this a 10, but the art really detracted frommy enjoyment as I had to ignore how badly the characters looked.\\n\\n\r\nOverall [8]:\\n\r\nEverything is decent except for the character art, which really brings down the overall score, but it has a good feel while watching it. As long as you don't care what the female characters look like.",

It has really nice colouring, esp. sheryl's hair, and lighting and a pretty good overall story.\r\nThe romantic aspect was a bit annoying for me though. 1 guy is liked by two girls for the whole 25 eps with no resolution. and the amount of times I heard \"it's all thanks to you alto-kun\" hurt.\r\ntouching, musically awesome and amazing sci fi ideas though :)\r\nIt has two older prequels if people would rather start from the begining but I haven't seen them yet.",

The whole anime has action, suspense and loads of music that will give a person chills all over them. The story follows a simple but amazing plot that has pieces of a lot of different anime and manga. No matter what type of anime you like you just have to give this a try and watch the first 2 episodes because you will get hooked by the music and fighting.",

            "content": "This is a series where I did not feel the story/plot would have carried the show, but the character development certainly did.\r\nThe story itself is mediocre-fair. Half way in, if someone asked me what the plot was, I would not have been able to give a coherent, comprehensive, and accurate answer. Today, if someone asked me, I'd be able to only give a vague 1 sentence answer.\r\nSo why the hell did I keep on watching?\r\nThe characters! You have Alto, Sheryl, and Ranka - a student who loves the skies but was born to a kabuki family, an established galactic idol, and a flegling singer whowants to become like Sheryl. The first is stuck in a complex where people call him \"Princess\", as if he's not masculine enough. He's also trying to become something his family opposes. The second is a confident, independent character seemingly overflowing with success in the entertainment industry. The third..is your typical shoujo girly girl, more or less. This is how they start out. \\n\\n\r\nAs I watched the show, every episode focuses on these three characters in a way that shows the audience how they grow and change in reaction to the circumstances around them. It made them feel real, like people you could care about. They had realistic and in depth character issues that made me want to keep watching them to see how they resolved it.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork wise, this show delivered well, especially for its time being produced in 2008 or so. It's artwork still surpasses even some modern anime.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack for this series is excellent. It has some of the most emotional pieces (melody and lyrics wise) that I have seen in anime. It also has some catchy pieces that I can listen to even now in 2017. May'n did a wonderful job performing the vocals for Sheryl. Ranka's songs are a bit typical of the anisong genre but Aimo is still a very nice tune. It was also nice to hear Maaya Sakamoto in OP1.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a very enjoyable experience. The characters are what carried the show and they are very well balanced too in that they helped one another grow.",
