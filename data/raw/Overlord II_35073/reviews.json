            "content": "I have never understood why Overlord receives so much praise. \r\nIt is practically Sword Art Online but with older characters, giving it the illusion of maturity. Overlord is not mature, it\u2019s not remotely well written, it's visuals don't even look good. The character designs look cool and all but that isn\u2019t enough to carry a boatload of mediocrity. Both this season and the first were at best disposable entertainment, like any other isekai light novel adaptation. What's the appeal of it? Is it that Momonga is a ridiculously overpowered self-insert protagonist and his legion of ladies all want him?\r\nMomonga IS Kirito. An overpowered character doesn\u2019tbecome good just by not being a teenage boy. Skeleton or kid, there is no difference. Skeletons are cool and all, I like them as much as the next guy, but he's not a very interesting character beyond his intimidating design. His character is entirely devoid of substance, only existing to continue the story. Even his character art fails at conveying the intimidation of his design. The designs made for the light novel look really good, but this adaptation\u2019s art lacks detail. During conversations, his skeleton face remains unanimated; his voice is undeniably booming, but there\u2019s no impact. \\n\\n\r\nMomonga being a villain changes almost nothing. Everyone still loves him anyway, and he acts like the generic \u2018nice guy\u2019 harem protagonist. He\u2019s constantly speaking in his nice guy voice in his head to remind us, he\u2019s not actually a real villain, he\u2019s doing the best he can to be nice. It\u2019s lovely how nice of a guy he is really\u2013wait, stop right there... If the villain protagonist isn\u2019t actually a villain, then this show is literally just the same as anything else\u2026 Like the meak voice hiding behind the intimidating demonic skeleton exterior, Overlord is masquerading as something far better and more original than it actually is. The philosophy of: \u201cHow can I self-insert if my main character isn\u2019t a good guy?\u201d breaks any potential this show had to become something original.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s funny how Overlord shamelessly admits that its female characters are coded to love Momonga, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less bad of writing. A story\u2019s world should ebb and flow without the audience needing to be there. Here it feels like a pandering fest; the characters bend over backward to praise Mr. Skeletor, he wins nearly every fight, and there is no substance beyond \u201cmoderately self-aware SAO\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThis new season of Overlord isn\u2019t all harem bullshit, it tries a few new things\u2026 and fails at all of them. For some reason, whenever the story follows any character other than Momonga it becomes insufferably boring. We got classic stories to be loved for ages like the tribe of lizard idiots who inevitably get taken over by Momonga, the thrilling backstory for Momonga\u2019s butler (aka Plank of Wood), some random knight guy, and a princess with a dark secret! Remember how Overlord\u2019s first season had somewhat slow pacing at times? This is 10 times worse! Entire episodes are dedicated to characters that we don\u2019t have a reason to care about. We're forced to watch them fighting in their own battles, with their own drama, and all of it barely connected to the characters introduced in the first season. In the end, the stories come together, but does the moderately entertaining end justify the tiresome means? Not at all. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s rare for anime to put me to sleep, but Overlord\u2019s first three (lizard focused) episodes truly tested my fortitude. The only plausible reason for the story breaking off from Ainz to follow the lizard people is to keep his harem junk from becoming too repetitive. The thing is though, Overlord will be repetitive no matter what crap they shove down our throats during the filler episodes. Isekai anime are so oversaturated that simply making more of the same isn\u2019t enough these days. I\u2019ve seen so many of these isekai power fantasies\u2014perhaps Overlord was more original when the light novel first began publication, but today it\u2019s trite, overdone, a waste of time. \\n\\n\r\nAt least the few episodes Momonga gets are slightly more entertaining than the filler ones. He and the people who surround him have eye-catching character designs, wacky personalities, and enjoyably overdone voice acting. There\u2019s almost no substance to any of them, but at least they\u2019re fun to watch in small doses. The thing is, this new season is barely about the actually exciting characters. The only one in Momonga\u2019s legion who gets a backstory is his butler (the blandest of them all). He has an actually intimidating personality, but none of the charisma necessary to hold up entire episodes on his own. There was a small amount of development seen for a few members of the huge cast, but it\u2019s for the boring ones that no one is watching the show for. An occasional twist in a character's personality following a surprising betrayal may offer some fleeting intrigue, but you will quickly realize that is all those twists exist for. To momentarily add a fresh coat of paint to a cast of rotting cardboard cutouts.\\n\\n\r\nMomga\u2019s episodes were at least better than the ones about random boring side characters, especially during the last three episodes of this season. We see all-out violence using nonsensical magic to create exciting gorefests and lots of angry expressions. It\u2019s still never what I\u2019d call good, but it\u2019s passable entertainment. Momonga\u2019s storylines do tend to get repetitive quickly; an issue arises among his legion or in the world, he is literally the most powerful being in the universe and kills shit, then gives us a comment on it in his \u2018nice guy\u2019 voice, rinse and repeat. The only reprieve from the mind-numbing formula is the final few episodes, full of gory action, plot twists, and even betrayals that actually had me surprised. Although I struggled to care about the turns the plot took or the characters who took radical changes, it provided a fresh perspective on the tired story even if for a moment. Sadly, the action-packed moments weren\u2019t much better than what we\u2019ve seen before from Overlord; plagued with issues caused by a rushed production. \\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes are lackluster at best. Madhouse is airing three anime just this season alone, so it would be unreasonable to expect flawless quality, but this is just flat out the same mediocre visuals as the first season. Action scenes rely on zoom in on still shots, unanimated motion tweens, and jarring CGI. Environments are dreadfully ugly to look at; dull colors, low res repeated textures, a lack of detail and defining traits. It all feels so lifeless, bland, boring. It\u2019s the kind of show I would have forgotten entirely if I wasn\u2019t reviewing it. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is equally mediocre, totally forgettable. The bog-standard sort of booming orchestral music they\u2019re going for simply fades into the background. I didn\u2019t particularly care for the opening song, just a generic rock song lacking of individuality. The ending track \u201cHydra\u201d was wonderfully wispy with haunting vocals. If the rest of the show carried even half of the emotional weight the ed does then we\u2019d have a much better show on our hands. It was the best part of the show, the only reason why I was hesitant to drop it all season. \\n\\n\r\nAnything separating Overlord from the hordes of low effort isekai adaptations we see every season is only superficial; neither the audiovisual or writing are above average. The main character being a \u2018villain\u2019 is just a cheap facade, the setting is lifeless, and even the cool designs are diminished by lackluster visuals. \\n\r\nOverlord is overrated. It\u2019s just more of the same boring isekai drivel.",

            "content": "Before I start off, I highly advise to not listen to the reviews that complain about something as if they\u2019re expecting lots of action and/or overloaded focus on the MC. Trust me, those are not very helpful if you\u2019re one that actually likes other equally important aspects of a series that focus more on the settings, story, and even development of supporting characters.\r\nThere are mixed reactions of how the first Overlord season went: some were raving about how OPed Ainz is, as well as his servants/guardians, and watching him display such power all season...while others felt like it was the elephant in the room. Sonow, we jump into a second season that might offend \"Ainz devotees and fanatics\" because of how much more it dedicates itself to other characters. However, I don't particularly find any problems with it at all; while the first season is better in terms of visual appeal, the second season is better in terms of overall character development and story. In short, people shouldn't really overreact so negatively about how this series goes.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: I really like the fact that the series switches up from the previous season and focuses on the actual \"heroes\" within Ainz's universe. Be mindful....Ainz, while being the main protagonist, is also technically THE main villain, which would make sense considering his appearance as a Lich. The pacing of the story is also very good for an adaptation, imo, and it really lets us look into the lives of the characters who are trying to oppose Ainz, which include the likes of the Lizard Men tribes. The setups of each important event or plot point are also done very well, and are not bumrushed like in most other series of the same genre. Now before one complains that the arcs seem out of place with no siegeway in-between and just focuses on the characters important to that arc and feel all over the place....this is actually still a method of world-building, much like how Log Horizon did in both seasons, though not as substantially as this series.\\n\\n\r\nART: While not exactly breathtaking or eye-popping, the animation style was as consistent as it was last season. Even the 3D animation wasn't really bad at all...it was actually very clean, even though the movements can get kinda choppy. The downside is that I wish they could've improved a little bit more on the overall style instead of staying the same.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: When it comes to the tense moments, the soundtracks do their job VERY well. Additionally, the light-hearted moments are accompanied by equally light-hearted bg music as well. Not much else to say there. Overall, the sound gets an efficient grade.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: This has been partially touched upon in the STORY section. The focus on other major characters, such as the Lizard Men, are really key to giving more structure to the overall story of Overlord. Despite what many people think, the series still gives an adequate amount of attention to Ainz and co...in particular, I benefited from learning interesting characteristics not previously touched on; for example, despite his intimidating looks, Coctyus is still a good person at heart for suggesting to spare the valiant members of Ainz's targets...I felt that important plot points like this give the already prevalent characters from the first season even more background and \"colorfulness\". In terms of my personal favorite character in this season, it would have to be Sebas, as his personality as well as capabilities are something I actually find as sort of an exaggerated but entertaining aspiration of a character. As for Ainz....he is just being Ainz as always...OPed, and very thoughtful in terms of military strategics and planning, and hilariously getting creeped out by the advances of the overly devoted Albedo (one of the most prevalent and lovable characters of this series).\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: For me, Overlord is always hype, whether I physically display my jokes out loud or keep it to myself while intently watching each episode. The 2nd season brought to me new perspectives that were already mentioned earlier. Additionally, for a guy like me who loves series where the main antagonist can be OR is the main villain, Overlord is like a \"godsent\" for me, and while it doesn't have the intense furious battles from stuff like the Fate series, the clashes are nonetheless quite the spectacles.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Don't listen to people complaining about this season; they're most likely very impatient and may or may not quit on the show too early when it would still be in early story development. Also, many people have said they hated the Lizard Arc from the book series, and thus by default, hate this season as well.\\n\r\nI advise one to watch it because I feel it's a refreshing break from a previous season where all we saw was just Ainz and his co, and not much anyone else. If you like more development with support characters, then it's all the more reason to watch it.\\n\r\nIn short, it's a good season that doesn't deserve so much early criticism.",

            "content": "The greatest allure and strength of the Overlord narrative has always been Ainz\u2019s delicate dance between the ordinary dime-a-dozen salary man of Earth and his Overlord status in this other world. His utterly devoted fanatical underlings treat him like that of a god who can do no wrong. He can\u2019t afford to make mistakes because his servants cannot imagine him making one. To make one is to not be a god. And he intends to keep that image because anything else might disrupt the equilibrium of Nazarick and, more importantly, jeopardize his safety and base of operations. In the strange world he finds himself in,the most powerful known beings who can threaten his safety are those under him. On and on, his everyman impulses struggles with what he thinks a supreme ruler should act. He must pretend to be prescient when he knows next to nothing and carefully delegate his subordinates in a way that gets his wishes done without revealing that he knows less than them on how to carry it out.\\n\\n\r\nHe\u2019s a man trapped in a situation that already slipped out of his control, propelled by his ever-faithful minions\u2019 tendency misconstrue his words as gospel, his musings as genius, and his luck as omniscience, as well as their fear that he would leave them as his guildmates already have. He\u2019s all they have left of the great beings they worship, and by jove they will raze the world to the ground in his name if that\u2019s what it takes to keep him by their side.\\n\\n\r\nEverything else about Overlord is just barely decent. The problem with the anime series is that it fails so hard to translate and convey the strongest core selling point of Overlord.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Overlord S2 is trying to sell now is the idea of a world bigger than its protagonist and that one fails too on two fronts: the core idea itself and the execution of that idea.\\n\\n\r\nOverlord, due to the nature of the LN, is a series that adds and adds, but rarely expands. You might wonder how can adding more and more detracts from a narrative. It does when you keep adding without expanding on what is already established. Overlord has multiple plot points and threads hanging in the air, the energy and time establishing them being wasted away. We\u2019re not going to tackle the source materials here though because it is a review of the anime adaptation so let\u2019s keep it to the anime adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nSuffice is it to say that the way Overlord is setup forces a quandary on the series. The first season does not easily expand into this second season and the first arc of this season does not expand into the second arc. You could say that they are merely individual build-ups sections \u2013 badly done build-ups at that, not because there is no immediate pay-off but because they feel like (and probably are) build-up to different things. It\u2019s risking the fact that you may not get invested in the flow of the story because there is really no smooth flow of the story yet. Again, this isn\u2019t a fault of the adaptation and it can very easily be rectified by solid execution. It starts off with a little bit of disadvantage but just really needs to present itself right and everything will fall into place.\\n\\n\r\nDoes it?\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 is an adaptation of Volumes 4, 5, and 6 of the light novel. Volumes 5 and 6 are two continuous stories, a mega-arc if you will. Volume 4, however, connects to Volume 5 with only the barest, thinnest of threads. These are two very different arcs with vastly different locales, (massive) set of characters, and conflicts that need to be established all under 13 episodes. That\u2019s simply not enough time for two different stories (with at least two different storylines running in parallel.) in two different types of settings. That is insane.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters could have been the saving grace in the transition but here\u2019s the thing: Overlord S2 sidelines the Season 1 characters with significant screentime to side character status. That\u2019s not a bad thing. Heck, done well it could have been a good thing. The problem is that the new season starts with a new set of characters you don\u2019t really care about and then the show botched its attempt at making you care about them and then uses them for only five episodes before they are then discarded to introduce yet another fresh batch of characters. The problem here isn\u2019t even in you losing track of who they all are. The problem here is if you even care at all who they are. It\u2019s a large mess that frankly is easier to follow than to care about.\\n\\n\r\nMadhouse forgot one simple Ron Swanson principle: never half-ass two things; whole-ass one thing. You can feel the oozing, overpowering, rank mediocrity as the studio rushes through the Lizardman Arc to get to the next arc. Rather than skip the first arc to focus on the next or give the first arc justice, they decide to do the first arc but do it in such a way that they get to the next arc faster, a decision that they didn\u2019t even do justice come the next arc. This decision gives us a lot of hastened info dumps, uninspired character designs, insipid backdrops, and budget fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nWhat few genuinely strong moments it could have had, it squanders for lack of pacing. A painful example of this is Zaryusu's rather interesting and compelling argument (on why they should fight) that lost every sense of impact possible due to the fact that it was said immediately with nary a proper establishment of the Lizardmen economy and culture or Zaryusu's place in all that. It was pulled out of the hat and we're supposed to just accept it because it was said so without planting the seeds of ideas first in the viewers (sadly this isn\u2019t an isolated case or adaptation specific failure even). It didn't even need to go to great lengths for its setting. It just needs to establish the setting enough to ground the arc's main character in it. It failed. It simply did not have the luxury of time for the size of the story it attempted to tell.\\n\\n\r\nImagine if it developed that. Imagine a tribal setting, a rarity in anime, with Lizardmen instead of humans as the main characters, which is even rarer. Imagine how much it could have had expanded on what little the LN established. Imagine the different tribal colors and patterns depending on the locale of a specific tribe: say solid, blocky lines for the mountainous, flowing curves for the lake-bound. Paint a picture in your mind\u2019s eyes, a cacophony of colors and patterns anime never tackled before. Imagine the new-ness, the fresh-ness of it all. Can you see it? It\u2019s only a simple scenario of how they could have gone with the series if they focused on one arc and did it justice. \\n\\n\r\nTo be frank, Overlord S2 is boring. Not because it\u2019s too slow but because it\u2019s too fast. The entire season feels like it\u2019s just a pure un-distilled fan-service for the LN readers. It\u2019s a chance for them to see their favourite scenes and characters animated and acted out. If you\u2019re an anime-only watcher, expect not to care about anything because this show is the equivalent of you in a tour through a safari/wildlife preserve and your tour vehicle is moving at 100km/h. There\u2019s something out there, you just can\u2019t savour it.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the second season seemed like it was made just to keep the Overlord flame going. The studio realized they have a popular IP and they need to keep what little hype was left from the first season two+ years ago so that they can revisit the idea of another season down the road if they need to. And it shows. This is as cheap, as rushed, and as unimaginative as they can make it. Frankly you should ask yourself this: if Madhouse couldn\u2019t be arsed enough to care, why should you?",

I highly suggest you watch thefirst season, or you wouldn't be able to enjoy the full experience season two will be giving you. (and you won't understand a thing... so yeah !)\\n\\n\r\nI don't really understand some beef people are giving the anime arc. Like sure the first four episodes so far has been about an  arc that isn't really focused on the MC in the light novel. But there's obviously a reason for this The reason for these episodes is literally an introduction of the plot and is super hyped later.  Trust me. The suspense in the light novel, if portrayed in this anime, will be no joke. It will be one word: amazing. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is really nice and is better than your average anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning OST fits well with the theme of the anime. The ending... not so much but it's still pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are really well developed in this season. Even characters that are supposed to be side stories, the anime provides us the chance to understand these characters and their actions, attaching the audience to these characters and their emotions.\\n\\n\r\nI'm really enjoying this anime. You will too. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the only thing that this anime is not perfect in other eyes is because the first episodes are about an irrelevant arc in the light novel. But trust me, as soon as this arc gets rolling the anime will become super fun to watch. Like Naruto(if you watched it), there were many parts that were \"boring\". But those boring scenes help hype up the whole season and were the main reason that the anime could grow in development. \\n\\n\r\nI HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU WATCH THIS ANIME. \\n\\n",

The meme of \u201cMadhouse not making sequels\u201d got flushed down the toilet when Overlord II became a reality. As someone who has read part of the novel and seen the first season, I\u2019m sad to say that Overlord II didn\u2019t manage to step up the plate. What could have been a chance for the series to improve itself and set new bar instead is met with a step back. If you\u2019re expecting the second season to be a glorious showstopper, then I\u2019m afraid I gotbad news.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll say right off the bat that Overlord II pretty much screams \u201cwatch the first season!\u201d In fact, I suggest checking out some of the more prominent episodes from the first season is necessary if you want to get a better experience. This show isn\u2019t here to feed you with exposition anymore. The first season has done that already and viewers should expect a developing storyline with established characters. Or that seems to be the case at first. However, the first few episodes not only reintroduces previous characters but also introduces new ones. An important race known as the \u201cLizardmen\u201d get their spotlight as we are introduced to their society. We learn about their culture, characteristics, military, economy, and motivations. To me, the Lizardmen possesses many human traits and emotions that aren\u2019t too different compared to our own. Characters such as Zenburu Gugu, Green Claw Tribe Chieftain Shasryru and his brother Zaryusu displays their fierce personalities that makes them example of being capable leaders. Then, there are characters like the priestess Crusch Lulu who represents a more fragile and feminine side of the Lizardmen tribes. The point of the show seems to be trying to get viewers into accepting them and worth investing into. However, it didn\u2019t do an adequate job as a good amount of these Lizardmen characters aren\u2019t well developed. It\u2019s a series that attempts characterization at non-human characters but ends up not accomplishing the job. It also doesn\u2019t help that the story is incredibly predictable for their inevitable fates when facing off against powerful enemies.\\n\\n\r\nThis only consist the first half of the show that adapts volume 4 from the light novel series. These first six episodes tries to get fans back into the mood but honestly, I felt like expectations were betrayed. As a curious person, I was hoping the remaining episodes would improve but oh boy, I was wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThe remainder half of the show (roughly 7 episodes) covers the plot from the novel based on the \u201cThe Men in the Kingdom\u201d (volumes 5-6). My initial expectations weren\u2019t high as the first of these episodes had odd pacing and didn\u2019t get me interested in characters except for Sebas. The other problem is that he is already a somewhat established character so it easy for viewers to accept him. Characters such as Climb, Brain, Tsuare, and Renner are much harder to accept. It falls into the pit of weak characterization again as they are hardly well developed outside of their personalities. We don\u2019t learn much about their past and their motivations for fighting is hardly interesting. Renner is also a character that\u2019s easy to point fingers at once viewers discover her true personality. The one character that does stand out a bit is Sebas during this arc as he shows a more valiant side of him after understanding Tsuare. Does that make him a breakout star? Not really. While Sebas is definitely a motivating factor to keep up with the arc, he is limited to a generic philosophy of helping a damsel in distress. I also find his role with Solution to be rather blend. The way Solutions suspects Sebas of being a betrayer to Ainz can easily make the audience dislike her. Still, I think the weakest part of this arc involves the antagonists, the Eight Fingers. Their key members are incredibly ill-written with dull motivations and stereotypical personalities. None of them are worthy enough to remember and I honestly wish they didn\u2019t even exist. They didn\u2019t manage to bring out the best out of anyone and in fact, I think they even puts a shame in the limited battle scenes. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve talked a lot about the minor and supporting characters of the show. What about the main characters? Sadly, there\u2019s hardly any development for them. For the case of the floor guardians and battle maids, we only get to see a few of them showcase their abilities. If you\u2019re a fan of Cocytus, Demiurge, Aura, or Entoma, then it might be a soft treat. Don\u2019t expect much from them as their roles are limited. It feels like this second season tries to do too much to give them any sort of meaningful place honestly. Oh and how can I forget the infamous Ainz/Mmonga. It may sound strange for me to mention him this late in the review. Save the best for last right? Actually, Ainz is far from the best character in this series and I would actually label him as one of the worst. As the guild master of Ainz Ooal Gown, he feels a lot more like a background character this season. There\u2019s virtually no development for Ainz and it\u2019s a big slap to anyone who wants to understand more about him. We see him sit in the back like a God monitoring his servants and issuing orders. It\u2019s incredibly stale to see Ainz in such a role. The first season at least established his personality in a way that was thrilling enough but this sequel dropped the ball. Sadly, his biggest fangirl Albedo isn\u2019t any better this season besides glorifying her own fetishes. \\n\\n\r\nMadhouse returns and while I can\u2019t say I\u2019m impressed by the overall quality, it does make a nice attempt at designing the Lizardmen. They look faithful to the light novels and expresses human characteristics that I occasionally find enticing to watch. Violence is also exploited to bring out the dark fantasy elements of its story. However, there are two main drawbacks that I find unappealing for this season. First, it\u2019s the action scenes as some of them are very limited and lazily animated. Second, it\u2019s the world setting. It feels like once you\u2019ve seen it once, you\u2019ve seen them all. Hardly original and uninspiring. \\n\\n\r\nThe first season\u2019s OP song was quite a thrill to the ears. This season took a step back and I find it skippable at times. Similarly, most of the human characters\u2019 dialogues consists of weak words choices that I can\u2019t really find worth quoting. On a more positive note, I did like the way the season used its battle OST. While some of those fights did feel short, the soundtrack did make up for a bit of the impact to highlight their intensity. Some of the emotional segments of the sequel (in particular Sebas and Tsuare) also felt real with the melancholic usage of the music.\\n\\n\r\nAh, Overlord II. It\u2019s a sequel that shouldn\u2019t have been resurrected if this is what the creative team had planned. Adapting those light novels into a 1-cour show felt like a risky plan and they didn\u2019t manage to capitalize. It\u2019s a series that\u2019s exciting to watch as a linear continuity but if you\u2019re interested in a well-developed story and characters, then look elsewhere. Too bad really. The show boasts a talented cast that kicked off with some wild entertainment before spiraling into disappointment with no looking back.",

            "content": "Overlord 2, written by Kugane Maruyama, Illustrated by So-bin.\r\nMy Review About Overlord Season 2 (Winter 2018) (Sorry for my bad english :( )\r\nIt contains some spoiler, Read with your own risk ^_^ .\r\n- Story 8/10 - :\r\nOverlord Season 2, comes with 13 Episode, Animated by Studio Madhouse.\r\nFirst Episode you can say it as Introduction about Overlord Season 2, Flashback about what is happening in Previous season, and preparation for the next Arc.\r\nOverlord Season 2, contain a \"World Building Arc\", where the side characters spawn more than the Main Characters and explain what happening with this Side Characters and their Story (it's kinda like every humanhave own Story of their life). If you still don't Understand about it, I recomended you to play RPG-Game first before watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning (Episode 2) we will redirect to Lizardman Arc. Lizardman Arc is one of the \"World Building Arc\" which is the last goal of Ainz Ooal Gown(or you can say The writter) to make a Country where all of Demi-humans can live together with Happiness (Including Dwarf, Lizardman, Elf and others).\\n\\n\r\nBack to the Story, this Lizardman Arc, show about how Lizardman live together, suffering about food, sacrifice others Lizardman using a War in order to reduce an overpopulated Lizardman. Everything you see in this 4 Episode mainly about Lizardman's Tribe. (Episode 2-5)\\n\r\nZaryusu Shasa is the Main Protagonist for this Arc, it ll explained well how he re-united all of the Lizardman's Tribe after the last war, found his Lover Crush Lulu, preparing a war agains Nazarick, Killing Iguva (Ainz Undead), and later killed by Cocytus and got revived.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story is good, its explained well from Viewpoint of Lizardman, nothing rushed in this Arc, it was same as Light Novel Story, I really love episode 3 where Zaryusu vs Iguva , and episode 4 where Ainz move like a Supreme being in front of Lizardmans. its kinda unique and interesting for me.\\n\\n\r\nMove to next story about Man In Kingdom 1 & 2 Arc(Episode 6-13), about this Arc im agree with some people that it rushed since they already wasting few episode focusing on Lizardman. but im not really worried about it, basically the main plot are still there and still explained carefully so the audience will not confused about it. this Arc will explore more about the characters on Re-Estize Kingdom (Climb,Renner,Blue Rose etc), and continuation of 'Sebas Story' (If you watch season 1 Sebas was sent by Ainz to Re-Estize Kingdom as a bait to find people who brainwashed Shalltear). \\n\r\nAbout this arch i really love Last 3 Episode, especially when Entoma vs Blue Rose and Ainz vs Jaldabaoth. its make me want to watch more of this anime. (and luckly they announced the Season 3).\\n\\n\r\nFor me the Story of Overlord season 2 is Very Good with this all of World Building.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Art : 8/10 -\\n\r\nAnimated by studio Madhouse, the Art is Great, the Colour, the Brightness the Graphic and the Blur Effect, Texture, and the some Side-effect mixed well, even in some scene the character face was changed a bit but it still acceptable since it doesnt change that much.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Sound : 7,5/10 -\\n\r\nI Love the Opening and the ending Song, the sound effect, and the Bg Music also well-played\\n\\n\r\n- Character : 8/10 -\\n\r\nThe World Building Arch explained well how the character grown up and their specific characteristics. it explore well how Zaryusu come as a Brave Warrior, how he has a feeling with Crush Lulu, you can even see their Sex scene !!, Crush lulu that always support him until the end.\\n\r\nthe 'Yandere' Princess Renner, Loyal Dog Climb, how the relation about Master-Servant was build among them. Sebas that have \"Touch-me settings\" inside him, Tsuareninya feeling througt Sebas, and also how Evileye fallen in love with Momon, Entoma's character was shown in this Season 2 as well, Sadistict Mare ,Brain Unglaus that face up his fear again Shalltear and a lot of it. it was Very Good and explained well in this Season.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment : 9/10 -\\n\r\nGreat !, im already Enjoyed this show since first Season, what makes me enjoy this show?. \\n\\n\r\n*This is a Dark show with a lot of Blood, Gore, where cut human's head is acceptable, its fit well for me. its also contains a Funny scenes, especially when Ainz-sama talking in his mind about what he need to do, or when the emotion taken away because he is Undead. its fun and refreshing.\\n\\n\r\n*The Master-Servant relationship between Ainz and his Guardians is also interesting, the Loyalty of the Guardian is so awesome, you can only find this relationship only when you watching Overlord (The Master-Servant relationship without any betrayal from both side). where they can accept each other, Hating anyone outside but Loves everyone inside 'Great Tomb of Nazarick', Believe that you can't betraying someone who gives you a life, the Truth about Loyalty, sometime it feels Heartwarming (If you watch last episode of Overlord Season 1).\\n\\n\r\n*There is less lovey-dovey scenes where the MC is surrounded with a lot of Girls who loving him, the only people loving Ainz is only Albedo !!!, yes Albedo !!, what about shalltear??? She is loving Ainz because of her fetish about Undead !!, so dont calculate her !!! :P , Evileye? ah She love Darkness \"Momon\" not our Supreme Lord Ainz-sama...(eventhough they are same xD)\\n\\n\\n\r\n*Non-idealistict show, its not the show where the MC trying to save everyone he met (especially girl), even its impossible, its also not the show where someone can gain Over Power when they are pressed..., this show teach you how to become more Realistic, what you can save and what you need to sacrifice in order to save someone, the difference between the Strong and the weak,Profit and loss, it also teach you even you are OP(Overpowered) you still need a plan boyo!\\n\\n\r\nThats the point why i enjoy this show, its a Great show for me.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall : 8,5/10 - \\n\r\nOverlord Season 2, a sequel of Overlord Season 1, was a good show, there is a lot point if you watching it carefully,If you think Overlord is Anime with full Action Genre then you completely wrong. it also have political scene and Drama like Anime \"Maou No Yuusha\" but with more soft scenes that make people understand what's going on, this anime will not fit for someone who searching a lot of fight and battle scenes. and this series need a continuation to connect all of the side and main event, thats why i recommended you to watch it properly. \\n\r\nBasically Overlord are different with some anime like SAO and Log Horizon. Overlord, Ainz and his NPC was Transported from Game World (YGGDRASIL game) to Another World (Isekai) called New World(NW), he cannot using the Game feature anymore right after transported to New World, he cannot logged out because of this, while SAO and Log Horizon still remain in their Game World(Trapped in Game World) and still able to using the Features of the game itself. Thats why they are searching the way to logged out from the Game. Some people are misunderstanding about this matter.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall for this show is 8,5 and it is Great, worth and enjoyable to watch.\\n",

            "content": "Review written at episode 4.  I have not read the light novel.  Will update nearer the end of the season.\r\ntl;dr: So far, worthless.\r\nWhether it be because the manga went through a slump, or whether Madhouse simply didn't try with this arc, the end result is terrible.  The character designs are uninspiring, the plot is boring, and the character interactions felt as though they'd been lifted from a template.  Compared to the first season, which I loved every moment of, this is abysmal.\r\nIs there anything that Madhouse did right?\r\nYes.  The moments where it paid attention to Shalltear's inner turmoil about whathappened at the end of last season, and the thought cocyutus put into his answers when interrogated by Ains were well done.  They may have been a tad obvious (shallow), but still appropriate and well executed.  However, these moments don't even account for a whole episode's worth of screen time.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, with the exception of the lizardmen, the characters are well-designed (and drawn) and the soundtrack is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSo what could Madhouse have done better?\\n\\n\r\n- If they really had no choice but to include all of this, they could have reformatted it into flashbacks.  The biggest problem with this garbage is that it's four episodes of continuous garbage.  If it were broken down into chunks, as could be done with a flashback, then it would be more tolerable.  As it is, it's just going to turn people away before it gets good.\\n\\n\r\n- Preferrably, though, don't include this rubbish in the first place.  There is a rather large amount of \"character development\" that serves no benefit to the story.  If said character development was done well, then this wouldn't be a problem, but it's heavy-handedness and outright sillyness simply makes the characters seem superficial.  Had Madhouse decided to distribute this arc through flashbacks, this would be the perfect excuse to remove all the lazy character development.  By starting off with \"these two are in a relationship\" then later clarifying on the important points of \"how it happened\", the majority of the uninteresting content could be cut, giving more time for the development of the interesting characters.\\n\\n\r\n* let me be clear, I am not a particular fan of flashbacks, I just support their appropriate use to remove periods of boredom or inactivity.\\n\\n\r\n- Alternatively, they could have simply put more effort into the first four episodes.  While some are hardcore fans of remaining true to the source, if the source contains a clearly sub-par section, minor, targeted revisions can be beneficial.  If this was merely a matter of madhouse not caring about these episodes and simply rushing them, then they've dug their own grave.\\n",

            "content": "Overlord is a Japanese light novel series that was written by Kugane Maruyama and illustrated by so-bin. It began serialization online in 2010, before being acquired by Enterbrain. Twelve volumes have been published since July 30, 2012. A manga adaptation by Satoshi Oushio, with art by Hugin Miyama, began serialization in Kadokawa Shoten's manga magazine Comp Ace from November 26, 2014. A 13-episode anime television series adaptation by Madhouse aired between July 7 and September 29, 2015. The second season ran from January 9 to April 3, 2018. A third season is planned for July 2018.\r\nOverlord is back. Now with 100% more lizard porn, agroup of adamantine class adventurers, a band of highly-class bloodthirsty thieves controlling many people, and a yandere princess. For those who already know what Overlord is about, I must say that the new season has not changed at all. It again takes the series some episodes to start the whole thing: you will be shown, let us say, a filler that is not that entertaining to watch. More than that, it is so bad that it might make you want to drop the second season. Fear not, if you do hate the filler, just skip it. All the fun starts afterward.\\n\\n\r\nOverlord did become much better because of its story-line and characters. Ainz Ooal Gown yet again continues his quest on becoming top class adamantine adventurer to collect enough information for Nazarick. Many things are still unexplained, but the second season also answers many questions that have not been answered in the first season. Character wise, many new characters have been introduced starting from the Nazarck servants and ending with many anti-heroes that have their interesting backgrounds for you to find out about. But this is, of course, not the best part about characters. What you will surely appreciate is the fact that many Nazarick\u2019s servants receive a ton of development. Indeed, I am not going to go into details, but I will say only one thing--you will love it. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Overlord is still one of the most epic series about MMORPG games. The second season offers you a more detailed look at Nazarick\u2019s servants and the enemies Ainz will have to face. I would highly recommend you start watching the anime right from the 6th episode; otherwise your opinion on Overlord might change because of it.",

(Long story short our boy Ainz just keeps on looking more and more OP)\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9 \\n\\n\r\nNot much to say other than pretty beautiful, nice little mix of sword/mage fighting and all looked really sleek and cool\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe music pretty much the same as season 1\\n\r\nEverything fits the mood, but other than the song started during the credits of the penultimate episode none of them left an imprint on my mind, so nothing special\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10 \\n\\n\r\nNow I love all this ridiculous character building they have done on just random individuals or groups around the world\\n\\n\r\nThey have a little warriors spirit saga with Cocytus and an odd little maid master gangs conundrum with Sebas, both polar opposite sort of feel but both really endeared me to these characters (specially Sebas)\\n\\n\r\nA lot of focus was also put on the humans Ainz had met and their companions, and they added a nice extra level of nerves to the show, as for a change you were routing for someone who wasn't all powerful, and actually might lose\\n\\n\r\nAlso I do have to do a little shout out, I wont name any names to prevent spoilers but I love that there seems to be the making of a Yuno Gasai 2.0 in the overlord world now (I'm a sucker for a Yandere)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\\n\r\nI love this show, and yes it's got a slight dark undertone to the anime but I think it's important when watching it not to take it too seriously\\n\r\nI don't believe this anime was made with the intention to be incredibly gritty and dark with a highly intelligent story\\n\r\nNo, but it is exciting, sometimes shocking, and I am always on the edge of my seat just waiting for that next ridiculous thing to happen\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think they done a good job, although the story could be seen as a little slow i feel like the extra scenes had their purpose and helped to build the world\\n\r\nI really hope, now that they have laid the groundwork they can press on and make season 3 something special\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ok, so most of the reviews here are based on only 4 episode out of the 11 episodes available, so that is why a lot of people are giving such bad reviews, which i think is not fair for this Awesome Anime.\r\nStory: Just as the first Overlord, the story is all about Momon-san, our protaginist, trying to conquer the new universe and trying to find Ydragsil players, if any, on the new universe. As you watch this Anime you would be asking: Why cant he wiped out everyone and that's it? since our protagonist and their crew are like the strongest beings in there? Howeverif you watched carefully our Protagonist, even though is an undead is still a human being and as a Rational thinking person He is REALLY CAREFUL about doing something, Plus of the threat of someone having mind control which makes him more cautelous about acting reckless, Thus the slow progression of the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style is vey common yet Awesome the world feels lively and characters are well designed. I dont like the 3d-like effect they made with some fighting and specially in battle with skull soldiers, but that is just my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Everything is amazing here the Opening, Ending, the soundtracks they use in the story blends really well making it more exciting,sad,funny, depending on the situation. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I love some characters in here, However since there is so much characters some are left out and some takes all the screen times, Albedo takes really small screen time which you may forget about her, the first half of the anime you will only see Lizards man which is compresible why people did not like Overlord 2 since they are not our protaganist and still taking so much screen time. Still it was a nice Arc in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I CAN NOT STOP WATCHING THIS! there is something about Overlord that keeps you hooked. Just watching our strong protagonist force killing those bastard feels so satisfying. Just watching how omnipotent are they compared to the humans that feels so proudly, watching them giving justice to those bad guys is so enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Just give a little bit of patience and you will love it, The first 6 episodes are not really appealing because is about Lizard man which are ugly being and not to mention the IMPREGNATE ME part which was disgusting hahah. BUT after that it is so Fun to watch this, there is a lot of action, a lot of justice and understandable action from our protagonist, the music enhace the overall experience, Just wait until you see EP. 11 the masterpiece of the season, felt like a episodes written from Games of Thrones. So do not let some reviews fool you, you are missing out one of the best Anime this year!",

I love the storytelling and yes, not everything is about the mighty lord. I have nothing else to say about this anime, it's just good. Without spoiling anything, the second season actually focuses on side characters, to show their individual storylines. Though the mighty lord may have little influence on these characters, the show shows their personal experiences and what everyone is thinking about. This game is not just a game, it's really strategic and evenmighty lord cannot predict anything.",

The whole story can be divided into two parts (little bit of SAO feeling there), the lizardmen part and the princess part. They are not really related, I don't think they even mention the lizards after they are done with them. Or maybe they don't want to talk about them because of the thing they had to witness in the tent?\r\nThe characters are awesome and there is nothing else to say about them. I was basically fangirling (yes, that is aword) over Sebas and his style. The way he dealt with the bad guys was pure awesomeness.\\n\r\nThe story was well written but a little bit short.\\n\r\nI am really hyped about the next season.",

            "content": "Start slow and boring, but gradually getting more interesting towards the end. As a fans of 1st season of overlord, that's my impression after watching this. \r\nWithout spoil anything, overlord II consists of 2 arcs (just like the prequel). and I will tell you that first arc are slow and not so good, either story or action-wise. But it's building and contributing something to the plot, and one of them I've seen it already at 2nd arc. And maybe there are more to come in the next season (I really hope there will be 3rd season). But still, it would be better if they shortenthe 1st arc in just maybe 2-3 episodes, instead of 5. And I will tell you why next.\\n\\n\r\nNext let's talk about more interesting stuffs, the next arc offers a lot of good and promising developments. The story is quite interesting, and there are a lot of funny new characters too. Some are related to events in the 1st season, too bad the dangerous enemies (or should we called nation or organization) that gave Ains quite trouble before not properly updated here. but they still appear few times, that's pretty good too though it only increasing my curiosity. Aside from that, the 2nd arc provide more insight to Ains subordinates, like sebaz, cocytus, demiurge and that's nice to see. \\n\\n\r\nI would like to give more score if not for the short of episodes. There are a lot of things that I think it should be explained better and/or need longer introduction. The new characters sometimes just appeared randomly in the middle of events, and later we found that they're actually important characters. Some events switch randomly too because too much happening in the same time frame. That's even worse if you expects Ains get more screen times like I do, because he rarely appear throughout entire episodes, well.. he appeared a lot in the end though. What I want to say is, there should be more episodes, maybe they should make overlord 2 into 24-25 episodes. If not, they should just shorten the 1st arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe verdict is, overlord 2 still good to go, it's not better than the prequel though. Well, just endure the first few episodes if you just starting and bored. Overall overlord is good series, including season 1 this series can easily become my top isekai, game like, fantasy story. The concepts evil undead as protagonists is quite unique if I should say. Though Log Horizon still ranked above this, but I think it's plain rude to compare this to simple and brainless kid show like SAO. Please refrain to watch this if you just expect a lot of mindless actions and sappy love story. And I strongly recommend Overlord for those who like great fantasy anime inspired by game and have deep and interesting story and memorable characters.",

            "content": "There are some minor spoilers within from Overlord (season 1 and 2). It's nigh impossible to talk about it without giving away spoilers...\r\nBe warned please...\r\nAnother review of another anime but this time about Overlord - one of my favourite series of 2015. With was my sixth anime since my return to anime world I really enjoy it. \r\nIt was what I wanted. A series that connected to me since I read a lot of Warhammer & 40K. I wanted to watch some anime that focus on an evil character and this was it. \r\nI love it so much that I even bought the Light Noveland I was really surprised that the first season comprised of the first and second light novels and they made it so good.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season focus on Lord Ainz Ooal Gown or Momon who was trapped inside a game BUT DON'T WORRY - this is not SAO. This is more adult, more dark more epic if you like.\\n\\n\r\nAfter finish the first season I quickly try other animes out there (focus on this premise of trapped within a video game or even Isekai but this one is probably my favourite (closely followed by Konosuba)).\\n\\n\r\nWhen I learn that a second season was coming I was excited and true to be told is not as good as the first season. Why, you ask. Well, the first season focus a lot on our main character and the tower they live giving some background on the NPC that live and serve the tower of Nazarick (This in the first 6 episodes).  The next 6 episodes focus a lot on Momon with the help of Narberal as he explores the nearby city and trying to understand how things work (and how different they are from the game).\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile in the second season, the first six episodes follows a LOT of lizardman (some random guys who live nearby the tower) and what the plans are for them. Here we have a lot of interaction on Cocytus (Guardian of 5th floor) and somewhat in Demiurge (Guardian of 7th floor). The second part of the series focus again on Sebas (a buttler of Nazarick) and other non-related characters of Nazarick like Climb (nice name); evileye (last three episodes), Lakyus, Lord Stronoff, Gagaran, Tia, Brain\\n\\n\r\nMy main question is this... WHERE IS ALBEDO???? :) Yeah... there is almost no Albedo. Combining she has what? 5 lines throughout the season?\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the anime we learn that there is power people (well, to Nazarick standards they are like helpless ants) that rule E-Rantel and Momon wants to be a hero and so he with the help of Demiurge and the other Nazarick captains and Pleiades make that happen with some ruse that made some of the most awesome battles I've seen in anime.\\n\\n\r\nI know some people dislike the trope (I do as well) of over-powerful characters like in SAO or Smartphone or Death March BUT here it works because even if he is over-powerful it's not the even the focus on the anime (I mean battles and such). This anime focus a lot on politics and it's what I call High Fantasy (or Epic) like Game of Thrones (minus the sex). It's all about the characters (all of them) and not only Momon. True be told in the second season he appears only in the last two or three episodes. Even Sebas or Demiurge are ovepowerful but the way the artists and writer wrote made them interesting, even if before the battle you already know he or she is going to win. That's why this anime works. The writing skill of the creator. That's why SAO sucks. Because the writer makes all about the main character and made it all too easy - the other characters exist only to give more focus on our main. In Overlord that doesn't happen at all. \\n\\n\r\nThat ending left me wanting for more...WHAT A FIGHT between Momonga & Demiurge (they are still master and peer but - a ruse) Who the heck is that Princess Renner... She looks kawaii and scary as shit!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you want a dark epic anime, this is it. If you want an evil main character this is it. There are some hints in his monologue in the last episode that hints to that (well throughout the series he always did what we would considered evil BUT in this context it's acceptable... only by watching you would understand...) There is blood and fighting that last 10m per episode. There is comedy as well. Every NPC (Nazarick captains and Pleiades) are different. I really enjoy this show and I hope it doesn't take two years two have a third season.\\n\\n\r\nSo, why 8 instead of 9 or 10? Well first of all - NO ALBEDO! eheh and  because some episodes, even if they gave a bit of wide information about the world, it was very sparse and the story really didn't jump forward that much. I think the first 6 episodes were sub-par and in moments I thought this was another anime because the main characters are the lizards. I know the purpose was to give us more info on other races/places but they over do it. The last 6 episodes with Sebas and Demiurge were way better and I would have given a 10 without any question asked... so 6 and 10 divided it's equal 8 eheh",

            "content": "After Overlord's first season, full of badass characters and shows of power by Ainz, second season had a pretty rough start. Focus shifted from Nazarick to side characters, with Ainz and co. taking a back seat. Without a doubt, such change will disappoint people who watched this anime because of OP main cast.\r\nStill, it doesn't mean second season itself is bad. It's just different. Story moves from introducing Nazarick faction (first season) to outside world. Now we see lives of humans (and lizards) of Yggdrasil and Nazarick's actions from their perspective. And it rather is nice thing to see, especially when they actually show theirpower.\\n\r\nI'll agree with many opinions that first arc was weak. It was far too long for what happened during it. And while 2nd arc is much more reasonable, the last few episodes more than make up for everything bad in previous 2/3 of anime.\\n\\n\r\nNew characters introduced in 2nd season are an interesting bunch. Yeah, lizards are forgettable, I won't talk about them. But whole Blue Rose, especially Evileye and Lakyus, Unglaus and of course Renner, are really good characters that don't make you just wait for Ainz's appearance.\\n\r\nThis season also brought considerable development for Nazarick NPC's and shown their loyalty to Ainz.\\n\\n\r\nI've never watched this anime for its art or music, but I have to admit those were good. If you skip openings then don't. This one is solid.\\n\r\nWhile fight scenes aren't that special, they are pretty enjoyable. Animation is good and moves make sense. I'd even say there were some above average fights in this season.\\n\\n\r\nGenerally speaking, if you liked first season, you won't regret watching second one. You might not like it at first, or even be disappointed after finishing, but it's still a good anime. Don't get discouraged by slow start.",

            "content": "Overlord II is indeed a show full of lizards -at least for the first half of the season, which I have seen so far; and I have to admit, I became to some extent aroused when I saw the lizard reproduction activities (this season really has such a scene).\r\nOverlord never was an anime that really used well and often the theme of \"the man trapped inside a virtual reality game.\" No, it feels more like an anime of an overpowered man who knows all about the world - because he comes from outside it - and wields power over everything as long as he isthe only one with knowledge of the world and all its legendary items and such. \\n\r\nThe second season is a continuation of his quest to reassure himself that he is the only most powerful being in the world. He wondered in season 1 whether there was another like himself in the new reality, and to counteract against such possibilities, he conquers land and takes up missions to make himself rest assured. This season seems to show just a small portion of his overall longer quest than what one season can afford to show - that's the impression I get; a person who read the light novels might know better.\\n\r\nBut rest assured, it is actually quite interesting to see the lizards cower in fear (sort of) before the almighty Ainz Ooal Gown. To see the lizards be so overpowered by just one of Momonga's servants is very satsifying and entertaining.\\n\r\nI didn't like the art. The depiction of a particular icy sword was horrible and childish, and the drawing quality was low tier.\\n\r\nThe OSTs and OPs and performance of the voice actresses are part of the Sound category. Nothing too remarkable or horrible in there. EDs and OPs sound fine. OST I don't remember. VAs do their job.\\n",

            "content": "While I enjoyed this season of Overlord, I did not like it as much as I did season 1.  While the beginning story of the Lizardmen was the usual quality that comes from Overlord, especially the final battle, it was the transition into the Eight Finger's storyline that brought this season down a few notches.  \r\nThe primary problem is that too much attention was focused on Climb and Tuare, who were easily the most vanilla characters in the entire anime.  A young earnest boy who wants to be stronger and an innocent girl traumatized by the brutality of her world.  Theseare overdone tropes in anime, so it was a bit disappointing that so much of this season focused on them, when literally every other character on the show is more interesting.  The thing that saved the middle portion of the season was just how cool Sebastian is as a character.  \\n\\n\r\nThe battle in the capital was also entertaining, but, its not the kind of thing that should end a season because there was no true sense of danger there considering the circumstances surrounding the clash.  \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, there was much to enjoy about this season of Overlord.  As usual, the villains of Nazarick are entertaining to watch, the action was good, and there were some surprising moments and a few swerves.  But, still, I hope season 3 will be more like season 1 than season 2. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

            "content": "About a year ago, the anime community and myself were both surprised and glad that Overlord was getting a second season. This was shocking because Madhouse, the studio behind the first season, has a track record for creating one and done seasons that leave us wanting more, encouraging us to seek out and read the original material. Now with this sequel and another season of One Punch Man yet to come, it looks like Madhouse are starting to break their own tradition and create additional seasons. The question is though, was it worth it? It has been two and a half years since the firstseason started airing and now with the second season having ended its run, was it worth the wait? \\n\\n\r\nWell I'm about to tell you. Sit back, relax and check what what you are sitting on isn't Kinky, as I present to you the anime review for Overlord II. Lets begin. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place pretty much right where we left off from season 1 (like it never left us) with Momonga (or Ains Ooal Gown) having gathered information of the areas around him, plans to establish and expand Nazerick in this world that he is still stuck in. From there the story has two arcs that are each set in different locations. The first arc focuses on the tribal lives of native Lizardmen and how Ains wants to subjugate then to do his bidding. Whereas the second arc takes place in the royal capital and focuses more on an underground syndicate known as the Eight Fingers. These two arcs are used to establish what is sort of the purpose of the second season, world building. We are already established with Ainz and we know who he is and what his goals are so why not expand the world outside Nazerick to focus on areas that are going to be affected by his presence. As such the arcs are used to establish characters in those areas of the world and expand on some of Ains' followers. \\n\\n\r\nNow this is a good thing because we didn't know much of the world in the first season so having a second season expanding the world does alleviate some of the criticism that the first season had. But the second season establishes factions and characters that we don't get to see beyond the the first opening minutes of the first episode. So it isn't perfect. Likewise in order to keep you up to date with that particular area of the world, there is a lot of dialogue that explains current events and events that have happened before Ains' arrival. I'm not gonna lie, some of these dialogues going back and forth between these characters can be longer than they should be; making it boring to listen to after a few minutes and can make you tune out. But thankfully, there are some moments that do intrigue you and help you get to know this world and its inhabitants better. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSince we are pretty much established with Momonga, I will not be entirely focusing on him. Instead, I will be focusing on the characters that this season establishes. \\n\\n\r\nSo I said that this season focused more on Ains' followers. Well the followers that were focused on were Cocytus and Sebas in the first and second arc respectively. So lets start with Cocytus. Cocytus is a warrior, an honourable warrrior at that who has respect for other warriors who he deems worthy of earning his respect. He is also a bit of a single minded character who doesn't see the big picture and relying on characters like Demiurge for advice. Honestly, his character isn't that unique outside of proud warrior with an unshaken loyalty to Ains. Despite him being the focus of the all of Ains' servants in the first arc, his character isn't all that interesting. It is like he is built up to be this deadly warrior that the Lizardmen have no hope to beat. Speaking of the Lizardmen, it is surprising how much development they get. We see how they live and their traditions, all in the eyes of one Lizardmen, Zaryrusu Shasha. Zaryrusu is an outcast, opting to travel rather than to stay with the tribe. But when Ains starts knocking on the Lizardmen's door, he opts to unite the Lizardmen together to fight back. It's from there that we see the lives of the Lizardmen and how they live. In all honestly, seeing these events from the Lizardmen's perspective made me care for them more than I should have. Even though I knew their eventual fate, it was still entertaining to see what happens because I grew to like these characters, even with the romance angle between two Lizardmen being super awkard. \\n\\n\r\nNow Sebas is defiantly the more interesting character of the two mainly due to the people he encounters who also play quite a big role in the second arc. Simply put, Sebas is a gentleman. A character who has morals and is the most caring out of all of Ains servants, despite his actions make the people around him suspicious of treachery, even though he has shown unquestionable loyalty. We see this through him taking care of a girl who was casted aside and we see how much of a gentleman he can be. Of course he then runs into the Eight Fingers and just shows how much of a badass Sebas is. This causes him to encounter some of the characters the we get plenty of screen time for, mainly Climb. Climb is a character like Sebas, who has an unshakeable loyalty and has selfless morals. He may be not that great with a sword, but he has unquestionable determination and lack of fear because of his duty to bodyguard the Princess of the royal capital, Princess Renner. This is a double edge sword however. While his loyalty and determination makes him a character that is liked and respected by people around him, it also makes him blind to the Princess' intentions as her personality gets more......interesting as the show goes on, with an interesting smile to boot (gives me shivers just thinking about it). \\n\\n\r\nIt is nice to see characters outside of Nazerick getting personalities rather than being blank characters with names for Ains and co. to slaughter. It makes the world  seem more vibrant and seeing it from their perspective helps to establish characters that will eventually cross paths with Ains. That doesn't mean Ains is dropped from the picture as we see him trying to keep his Overlord persona by expanding and conquering his kingdom while also maintaining the loyalty of his followers. It is clear he cares for them because they remind him of his former guild members and doesn't want to doubt their loyalty although he will do what needs to be done to maintain his image. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nNow back in 2015, Overlord, while still having good animation, didn't really live up to Madhouse's standards. This was mainly due to the fact that Madhouse had a tight schedule with their releases so cuts had to be made in some places. I bring this up because it really doesn't feel like the animation has changed much. While there is notable up in animation in the fight scenes, it really doesn't feel like much has changed. This could be because Madhouse split the budget between Overlord II and the other Madhouse anime that aired in the winter season, Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card-hen. But like I said earlier, Overlord season 1 still had good animation and still applies here. It still animates well and there is still detail in the world but I feel disappointed that not much has changed. \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDo you like orchestral music? You should, because you will be hearing a bunch of it. The music from Overlord season 1 has pretty much carried over to season 2 which is actually rather nice. If it ain't broke don't fix it. Whether Ains' theme is playing in the background whenever he does something awesome or when something bad happens to \"Ains and co.\"'s opponents and the music is like \"oh s***, you're f*****.\" There is one new track that stands out to me and it is a sombre, quiet piece played when Princess Renner goes into one of her interesting personality moments. It sets an atmosphere really well and amplifies that aspect of Renner.  \\n\\n\r\nThe opening \"Go Cry Go\" by OxT is interesting to me mainly because I didn't get into it until I listened into it more. It's one of those openings that grows on you and you like it over time. Altough I don't know why this anime opening is obsessed with tilting heads. Like every character has to tilt their head in this opening. But if I have to choose to listen between this opening and the Season 1 opening \"Clattanoia.\" I probably choose Clattanoia. Go Cry Go didn't really impress me with its visuals as it is just a lot of the same imagery but with different characters. Clattanoia looked and sounded more fun which was appropriate for the kind of anime that we were watching. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending didn't impress me although I like the subtle changes of imagery as the show went on. \\n\\n\r\nMy feelings towards the dub are about the same as I felt about Seasons 1's dub. Besides Chris Guerrero's performance as Momonga (which was brilliant by the way), the performances for the dub characters were rather meh. Probably because the performance of Ains was that good due to him sounding like an evil Overlord with a voice that makes him imposing and is always planning something like a villain would. Although I did enjoy the performance of Bryan Massey as Cocytus since he gives Cocytus a more vocal range than his sub counterpart. But if I had the choice, i would probably listen to this anime in sub. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nSo I will bring up this question earlier, \"Was it worth the wait?\" Well considering that we had to wait almost two and a half years for a sequel we didn't think we would be getting. I would say sort of yes. While this sequel expands the world and its inhabitants, it isn't all clean cut and there are problems. There is also the disappointment of only slight improvement in animation quality, but I still enjoyed it and that what it really comes down to. I expected an enjoyable sequel and I got an enjoyable sequel. \\n\\n\r\nIt ain't finished though. There is still plenty of ground to cover in the overarching plot as areas of the world are still yet to be expanded upon. Thankfully, we are getting a new season this summer which is good news. It feels like the plot is getting really interesting and needs a continuation. So I will be looking forward to that but for now, I will enjoy what I got. \\n\\n\r\nMy Personal Enjoyment: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall score:  7.8/10   Recommendation: Watch it",

            "content": "I have never understood why Overlord receives so much praise. \r\nIt is practically Sword Art Online but with older characters, giving it the illusion of maturity. Overlord is not mature, it\u2019s not remotely well written, it's visuals don't even look good. The character designs look cool and all but that isn\u2019t enough to carry a boatload of mediocrity. Both this season and the first were at best disposable entertainment, like any other isekai light novel adaptation. What's the appeal of it? Is it that Momonga is a ridiculously overpowered self-insert protagonist and his legion of ladies all want him?\r\nMomonga IS Kirito. An overpowered character doesn\u2019tbecome good just by not being a teenage boy. Skeleton or kid, there is no difference. Skeletons are cool and all, I like them as much as the next guy, but he's not a very interesting character beyond his intimidating design. His character is entirely devoid of substance, only existing to continue the story. Even his character art fails at conveying the intimidation of his design. The designs made for the light novel look really good, but this adaptation\u2019s art lacks detail. During conversations, his skeleton face remains unanimated; his voice is undeniably booming, but there\u2019s no impact. \\n\\n\r\nMomonga being a villain changes almost nothing. Everyone still loves him anyway, and he acts like the generic \u2018nice guy\u2019 harem protagonist. He\u2019s constantly speaking in his nice guy voice in his head to remind us, he\u2019s not actually a real villain, he\u2019s doing the best he can to be nice. It\u2019s lovely how nice of a guy he is really\u2013wait, stop right there... If the villain protagonist isn\u2019t actually a villain, then this show is literally just the same as anything else\u2026 Like the meak voice hiding behind the intimidating demonic skeleton exterior, Overlord is masquerading as something far better and more original than it actually is. The philosophy of: \u201cHow can I self-insert if my main character isn\u2019t a good guy?\u201d breaks any potential this show had to become something original.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s funny how Overlord shamelessly admits that its female characters are coded to love Momonga, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less bad of writing. A story\u2019s world should ebb and flow without the audience needing to be there. Here it feels like a pandering fest; the characters bend over backward to praise Mr. Skeletor, he wins nearly every fight, and there is no substance beyond \u201cmoderately self-aware SAO\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThis new season of Overlord isn\u2019t all harem bullshit, it tries a few new things\u2026 and fails at all of them. For some reason, whenever the story follows any character other than Momonga it becomes insufferably boring. We got classic stories to be loved for ages like the tribe of lizard idiots who inevitably get taken over by Momonga, the thrilling backstory for Momonga\u2019s butler (aka Plank of Wood), some random knight guy, and a princess with a dark secret! Remember how Overlord\u2019s first season had somewhat slow pacing at times? This is 10 times worse! Entire episodes are dedicated to characters that we don\u2019t have a reason to care about. We're forced to watch them fighting in their own battles, with their own drama, and all of it barely connected to the characters introduced in the first season. In the end, the stories come together, but does the moderately entertaining end justify the tiresome means? Not at all. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s rare for anime to put me to sleep, but Overlord\u2019s first three (lizard focused) episodes truly tested my fortitude. The only plausible reason for the story breaking off from Ainz to follow the lizard people is to keep his harem junk from becoming too repetitive. The thing is though, Overlord will be repetitive no matter what crap they shove down our throats during the filler episodes. Isekai anime are so oversaturated that simply making more of the same isn\u2019t enough these days. I\u2019ve seen so many of these isekai power fantasies\u2014perhaps Overlord was more original when the light novel first began publication, but today it\u2019s trite, overdone, a waste of time. \\n\\n\r\nAt least the few episodes Momonga gets are slightly more entertaining than the filler ones. He and the people who surround him have eye-catching character designs, wacky personalities, and enjoyably overdone voice acting. There\u2019s almost no substance to any of them, but at least they\u2019re fun to watch in small doses. The thing is, this new season is barely about the actually exciting characters. The only one in Momonga\u2019s legion who gets a backstory is his butler (the blandest of them all). He has an actually intimidating personality, but none of the charisma necessary to hold up entire episodes on his own. There was a small amount of development seen for a few members of the huge cast, but it\u2019s for the boring ones that no one is watching the show for. An occasional twist in a character's personality following a surprising betrayal may offer some fleeting intrigue, but you will quickly realize that is all those twists exist for. To momentarily add a fresh coat of paint to a cast of rotting cardboard cutouts.\\n\\n\r\nMomga\u2019s episodes were at least better than the ones about random boring side characters, especially during the last three episodes of this season. We see all-out violence using nonsensical magic to create exciting gorefests and lots of angry expressions. It\u2019s still never what I\u2019d call good, but it\u2019s passable entertainment. Momonga\u2019s storylines do tend to get repetitive quickly; an issue arises among his legion or in the world, he is literally the most powerful being in the universe and kills shit, then gives us a comment on it in his \u2018nice guy\u2019 voice, rinse and repeat. The only reprieve from the mind-numbing formula is the final few episodes, full of gory action, plot twists, and even betrayals that actually had me surprised. Although I struggled to care about the turns the plot took or the characters who took radical changes, it provided a fresh perspective on the tired story even if for a moment. Sadly, the action-packed moments weren\u2019t much better than what we\u2019ve seen before from Overlord; plagued with issues caused by a rushed production. \\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes are lackluster at best. Madhouse is airing three anime just this season alone, so it would be unreasonable to expect flawless quality, but this is just flat out the same mediocre visuals as the first season. Action scenes rely on zoom in on still shots, unanimated motion tweens, and jarring CGI. Environments are dreadfully ugly to look at; dull colors, low res repeated textures, a lack of detail and defining traits. It all feels so lifeless, bland, boring. It\u2019s the kind of show I would have forgotten entirely if I wasn\u2019t reviewing it. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is equally mediocre, totally forgettable. The bog-standard sort of booming orchestral music they\u2019re going for simply fades into the background. I didn\u2019t particularly care for the opening song, just a generic rock song lacking of individuality. The ending track \u201cHydra\u201d was wonderfully wispy with haunting vocals. If the rest of the show carried even half of the emotional weight the ed does then we\u2019d have a much better show on our hands. It was the best part of the show, the only reason why I was hesitant to drop it all season. \\n\\n\r\nAnything separating Overlord from the hordes of low effort isekai adaptations we see every season is only superficial; neither the audiovisual or writing are above average. The main character being a \u2018villain\u2019 is just a cheap facade, the setting is lifeless, and even the cool designs are diminished by lackluster visuals. \\n\r\nOverlord is overrated. It\u2019s just more of the same boring isekai drivel.",

            "content": "Before I start off, I highly advise to not listen to the reviews that complain about something as if they\u2019re expecting lots of action and/or overloaded focus on the MC. Trust me, those are not very helpful if you\u2019re one that actually likes other equally important aspects of a series that focus more on the settings, story, and even development of supporting characters.\r\nThere are mixed reactions of how the first Overlord season went: some were raving about how OPed Ainz is, as well as his servants/guardians, and watching him display such power all season...while others felt like it was the elephant in the room. Sonow, we jump into a second season that might offend \"Ainz devotees and fanatics\" because of how much more it dedicates itself to other characters. However, I don't particularly find any problems with it at all; while the first season is better in terms of visual appeal, the second season is better in terms of overall character development and story. In short, people shouldn't really overreact so negatively about how this series goes.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: I really like the fact that the series switches up from the previous season and focuses on the actual \"heroes\" within Ainz's universe. Be mindful....Ainz, while being the main protagonist, is also technically THE main villain, which would make sense considering his appearance as a Lich. The pacing of the story is also very good for an adaptation, imo, and it really lets us look into the lives of the characters who are trying to oppose Ainz, which include the likes of the Lizard Men tribes. The setups of each important event or plot point are also done very well, and are not bumrushed like in most other series of the same genre. Now before one complains that the arcs seem out of place with no siegeway in-between and just focuses on the characters important to that arc and feel all over the place....this is actually still a method of world-building, much like how Log Horizon did in both seasons, though not as substantially as this series.\\n\\n\r\nART: While not exactly breathtaking or eye-popping, the animation style was as consistent as it was last season. Even the 3D animation wasn't really bad at all...it was actually very clean, even though the movements can get kinda choppy. The downside is that I wish they could've improved a little bit more on the overall style instead of staying the same.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: When it comes to the tense moments, the soundtracks do their job VERY well. Additionally, the light-hearted moments are accompanied by equally light-hearted bg music as well. Not much else to say there. Overall, the sound gets an efficient grade.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: This has been partially touched upon in the STORY section. The focus on other major characters, such as the Lizard Men, are really key to giving more structure to the overall story of Overlord. Despite what many people think, the series still gives an adequate amount of attention to Ainz and co...in particular, I benefited from learning interesting characteristics not previously touched on; for example, despite his intimidating looks, Coctyus is still a good person at heart for suggesting to spare the valiant members of Ainz's targets...I felt that important plot points like this give the already prevalent characters from the first season even more background and \"colorfulness\". In terms of my personal favorite character in this season, it would have to be Sebas, as his personality as well as capabilities are something I actually find as sort of an exaggerated but entertaining aspiration of a character. As for Ainz....he is just being Ainz as always...OPed, and very thoughtful in terms of military strategics and planning, and hilariously getting creeped out by the advances of the overly devoted Albedo (one of the most prevalent and lovable characters of this series).\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: For me, Overlord is always hype, whether I physically display my jokes out loud or keep it to myself while intently watching each episode. The 2nd season brought to me new perspectives that were already mentioned earlier. Additionally, for a guy like me who loves series where the main antagonist can be OR is the main villain, Overlord is like a \"godsent\" for me, and while it doesn't have the intense furious battles from stuff like the Fate series, the clashes are nonetheless quite the spectacles.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Don't listen to people complaining about this season; they're most likely very impatient and may or may not quit on the show too early when it would still be in early story development. Also, many people have said they hated the Lizard Arc from the book series, and thus by default, hate this season as well.\\n\r\nI advise one to watch it because I feel it's a refreshing break from a previous season where all we saw was just Ainz and his co, and not much anyone else. If you like more development with support characters, then it's all the more reason to watch it.\\n\r\nIn short, it's a good season that doesn't deserve so much early criticism.",

            "content": "The greatest allure and strength of the Overlord narrative has always been Ainz\u2019s delicate dance between the ordinary dime-a-dozen salary man of Earth and his Overlord status in this other world. His utterly devoted fanatical underlings treat him like that of a god who can do no wrong. He can\u2019t afford to make mistakes because his servants cannot imagine him making one. To make one is to not be a god. And he intends to keep that image because anything else might disrupt the equilibrium of Nazarick and, more importantly, jeopardize his safety and base of operations. In the strange world he finds himself in,the most powerful known beings who can threaten his safety are those under him. On and on, his everyman impulses struggles with what he thinks a supreme ruler should act. He must pretend to be prescient when he knows next to nothing and carefully delegate his subordinates in a way that gets his wishes done without revealing that he knows less than them on how to carry it out.\\n\\n\r\nHe\u2019s a man trapped in a situation that already slipped out of his control, propelled by his ever-faithful minions\u2019 tendency misconstrue his words as gospel, his musings as genius, and his luck as omniscience, as well as their fear that he would leave them as his guildmates already have. He\u2019s all they have left of the great beings they worship, and by jove they will raze the world to the ground in his name if that\u2019s what it takes to keep him by their side.\\n\\n\r\nEverything else about Overlord is just barely decent. The problem with the anime series is that it fails so hard to translate and convey the strongest core selling point of Overlord.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Overlord S2 is trying to sell now is the idea of a world bigger than its protagonist and that one fails too on two fronts: the core idea itself and the execution of that idea.\\n\\n\r\nOverlord, due to the nature of the LN, is a series that adds and adds, but rarely expands. You might wonder how can adding more and more detracts from a narrative. It does when you keep adding without expanding on what is already established. Overlord has multiple plot points and threads hanging in the air, the energy and time establishing them being wasted away. We\u2019re not going to tackle the source materials here though because it is a review of the anime adaptation so let\u2019s keep it to the anime adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nSuffice is it to say that the way Overlord is setup forces a quandary on the series. The first season does not easily expand into this second season and the first arc of this season does not expand into the second arc. You could say that they are merely individual build-ups sections \u2013 badly done build-ups at that, not because there is no immediate pay-off but because they feel like (and probably are) build-up to different things. It\u2019s risking the fact that you may not get invested in the flow of the story because there is really no smooth flow of the story yet. Again, this isn\u2019t a fault of the adaptation and it can very easily be rectified by solid execution. It starts off with a little bit of disadvantage but just really needs to present itself right and everything will fall into place.\\n\\n\r\nDoes it?\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 is an adaptation of Volumes 4, 5, and 6 of the light novel. Volumes 5 and 6 are two continuous stories, a mega-arc if you will. Volume 4, however, connects to Volume 5 with only the barest, thinnest of threads. These are two very different arcs with vastly different locales, (massive) set of characters, and conflicts that need to be established all under 13 episodes. That\u2019s simply not enough time for two different stories (with at least two different storylines running in parallel.) in two different types of settings. That is insane.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters could have been the saving grace in the transition but here\u2019s the thing: Overlord S2 sidelines the Season 1 characters with significant screentime to side character status. That\u2019s not a bad thing. Heck, done well it could have been a good thing. The problem is that the new season starts with a new set of characters you don\u2019t really care about and then the show botched its attempt at making you care about them and then uses them for only five episodes before they are then discarded to introduce yet another fresh batch of characters. The problem here isn\u2019t even in you losing track of who they all are. The problem here is if you even care at all who they are. It\u2019s a large mess that frankly is easier to follow than to care about.\\n\\n\r\nMadhouse forgot one simple Ron Swanson principle: never half-ass two things; whole-ass one thing. You can feel the oozing, overpowering, rank mediocrity as the studio rushes through the Lizardman Arc to get to the next arc. Rather than skip the first arc to focus on the next or give the first arc justice, they decide to do the first arc but do it in such a way that they get to the next arc faster, a decision that they didn\u2019t even do justice come the next arc. This decision gives us a lot of hastened info dumps, uninspired character designs, insipid backdrops, and budget fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nWhat few genuinely strong moments it could have had, it squanders for lack of pacing. A painful example of this is Zaryusu's rather interesting and compelling argument (on why they should fight) that lost every sense of impact possible due to the fact that it was said immediately with nary a proper establishment of the Lizardmen economy and culture or Zaryusu's place in all that. It was pulled out of the hat and we're supposed to just accept it because it was said so without planting the seeds of ideas first in the viewers (sadly this isn\u2019t an isolated case or adaptation specific failure even). It didn't even need to go to great lengths for its setting. It just needs to establish the setting enough to ground the arc's main character in it. It failed. It simply did not have the luxury of time for the size of the story it attempted to tell.\\n\\n\r\nImagine if it developed that. Imagine a tribal setting, a rarity in anime, with Lizardmen instead of humans as the main characters, which is even rarer. Imagine how much it could have had expanded on what little the LN established. Imagine the different tribal colors and patterns depending on the locale of a specific tribe: say solid, blocky lines for the mountainous, flowing curves for the lake-bound. Paint a picture in your mind\u2019s eyes, a cacophony of colors and patterns anime never tackled before. Imagine the new-ness, the fresh-ness of it all. Can you see it? It\u2019s only a simple scenario of how they could have gone with the series if they focused on one arc and did it justice. \\n\\n\r\nTo be frank, Overlord S2 is boring. Not because it\u2019s too slow but because it\u2019s too fast. The entire season feels like it\u2019s just a pure un-distilled fan-service for the LN readers. It\u2019s a chance for them to see their favourite scenes and characters animated and acted out. If you\u2019re an anime-only watcher, expect not to care about anything because this show is the equivalent of you in a tour through a safari/wildlife preserve and your tour vehicle is moving at 100km/h. There\u2019s something out there, you just can\u2019t savour it.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the second season seemed like it was made just to keep the Overlord flame going. The studio realized they have a popular IP and they need to keep what little hype was left from the first season two+ years ago so that they can revisit the idea of another season down the road if they need to. And it shows. This is as cheap, as rushed, and as unimaginative as they can make it. Frankly you should ask yourself this: if Madhouse couldn\u2019t be arsed enough to care, why should you?",

I highly suggest you watch thefirst season, or you wouldn't be able to enjoy the full experience season two will be giving you. (and you won't understand a thing... so yeah !)\\n\\n\r\nI don't really understand some beef people are giving the anime arc. Like sure the first four episodes so far has been about an  arc that isn't really focused on the MC in the light novel. But there's obviously a reason for this The reason for these episodes is literally an introduction of the plot and is super hyped later.  Trust me. The suspense in the light novel, if portrayed in this anime, will be no joke. It will be one word: amazing. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is really nice and is better than your average anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning OST fits well with the theme of the anime. The ending... not so much but it's still pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are really well developed in this season. Even characters that are supposed to be side stories, the anime provides us the chance to understand these characters and their actions, attaching the audience to these characters and their emotions.\\n\\n\r\nI'm really enjoying this anime. You will too. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the only thing that this anime is not perfect in other eyes is because the first episodes are about an irrelevant arc in the light novel. But trust me, as soon as this arc gets rolling the anime will become super fun to watch. Like Naruto(if you watched it), there were many parts that were \"boring\". But those boring scenes help hype up the whole season and were the main reason that the anime could grow in development. \\n\\n\r\nI HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU WATCH THIS ANIME. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Sequels based on light novels aren\u2019t too common but for a series like Overlord, it felt like it was inevitable. The meme of \u201cMadhouse not making sequels\u201d got flushed down the toilet when Overlord II became a reality. As someone who has read part of the novel and seen the first season, I\u2019m sad to say that Overlord II didn\u2019t manage to step up the plate. What could have been a chance for the series to improve itself and set new bar instead is met with a step back. If you\u2019re expecting the second season to be a glorious showstopper, then I\u2019m afraid I gotbad news.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll say right off the bat that Overlord II pretty much screams \u201cwatch the first season!\u201d In fact, I suggest checking out some of the more prominent episodes from the first season is necessary if you want to get a better experience. This show isn\u2019t here to feed you with exposition anymore. The first season has done that already and viewers should expect a developing storyline with established characters. Or that seems to be the case at first. However, the first few episodes not only reintroduces previous characters but also introduces new ones. An important race known as the \u201cLizardmen\u201d get their spotlight as we are introduced to their society. We learn about their culture, characteristics, military, economy, and motivations. To me, the Lizardmen possesses many human traits and emotions that aren\u2019t too different compared to our own. Characters such as Zenburu Gugu, Green Claw Tribe Chieftain Shasryru and his brother Zaryusu displays their fierce personalities that makes them example of being capable leaders. Then, there are characters like the priestess Crusch Lulu who represents a more fragile and feminine side of the Lizardmen tribes. The point of the show seems to be trying to get viewers into accepting them and worth investing into. However, it didn\u2019t do an adequate job as a good amount of these Lizardmen characters aren\u2019t well developed. It\u2019s a series that attempts characterization at non-human characters but ends up not accomplishing the job. It also doesn\u2019t help that the story is incredibly predictable for their inevitable fates when facing off against powerful enemies.\\n\\n\r\nThis only consist the first half of the show that adapts volume 4 from the light novel series. These first six episodes tries to get fans back into the mood but honestly, I felt like expectations were betrayed. As a curious person, I was hoping the remaining episodes would improve but oh boy, I was wrong.\\n\\n\r\nThe remainder half of the show (roughly 7 episodes) covers the plot from the novel based on the \u201cThe Men in the Kingdom\u201d (volumes 5-6). My initial expectations weren\u2019t high as the first of these episodes had odd pacing and didn\u2019t get me interested in characters except for Sebas. The other problem is that he is already a somewhat established character so it easy for viewers to accept him. Characters such as Climb, Brain, Tsuare, and Renner are much harder to accept. It falls into the pit of weak characterization again as they are hardly well developed outside of their personalities. We don\u2019t learn much about their past and their motivations for fighting is hardly interesting. Renner is also a character that\u2019s easy to point fingers at once viewers discover her true personality. The one character that does stand out a bit is Sebas during this arc as he shows a more valiant side of him after understanding Tsuare. Does that make him a breakout star? Not really. While Sebas is definitely a motivating factor to keep up with the arc, he is limited to a generic philosophy of helping a damsel in distress. I also find his role with Solution to be rather blend. The way Solutions suspects Sebas of being a betrayer to Ainz can easily make the audience dislike her. Still, I think the weakest part of this arc involves the antagonists, the Eight Fingers. Their key members are incredibly ill-written with dull motivations and stereotypical personalities. None of them are worthy enough to remember and I honestly wish they didn\u2019t even exist. They didn\u2019t manage to bring out the best out of anyone and in fact, I think they even puts a shame in the limited battle scenes. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve talked a lot about the minor and supporting characters of the show. What about the main characters? Sadly, there\u2019s hardly any development for them. For the case of the floor guardians and battle maids, we only get to see a few of them showcase their abilities. If you\u2019re a fan of Cocytus, Demiurge, Aura, or Entoma, then it might be a soft treat. Don\u2019t expect much from them as their roles are limited. It feels like this second season tries to do too much to give them any sort of meaningful place honestly. Oh and how can I forget the infamous Ainz/Mmonga. It may sound strange for me to mention him this late in the review. Save the best for last right? Actually, Ainz is far from the best character in this series and I would actually label him as one of the worst. As the guild master of Ainz Ooal Gown, he feels a lot more like a background character this season. There\u2019s virtually no development for Ainz and it\u2019s a big slap to anyone who wants to understand more about him. We see him sit in the back like a God monitoring his servants and issuing orders. It\u2019s incredibly stale to see Ainz in such a role. The first season at least established his personality in a way that was thrilling enough but this sequel dropped the ball. Sadly, his biggest fangirl Albedo isn\u2019t any better this season besides glorifying her own fetishes. \\n\\n\r\nMadhouse returns and while I can\u2019t say I\u2019m impressed by the overall quality, it does make a nice attempt at designing the Lizardmen. They look faithful to the light novels and expresses human characteristics that I occasionally find enticing to watch. Violence is also exploited to bring out the dark fantasy elements of its story. However, there are two main drawbacks that I find unappealing for this season. First, it\u2019s the action scenes as some of them are very limited and lazily animated. Second, it\u2019s the world setting. It feels like once you\u2019ve seen it once, you\u2019ve seen them all. Hardly original and uninspiring. \\n\\n\r\nThe first season\u2019s OP song was quite a thrill to the ears. This season took a step back and I find it skippable at times. Similarly, most of the human characters\u2019 dialogues consists of weak words choices that I can\u2019t really find worth quoting. On a more positive note, I did like the way the season used its battle OST. While some of those fights did feel short, the soundtrack did make up for a bit of the impact to highlight their intensity. Some of the emotional segments of the sequel (in particular Sebas and Tsuare) also felt real with the melancholic usage of the music.\\n\\n\r\nAh, Overlord II. It\u2019s a sequel that shouldn\u2019t have been resurrected if this is what the creative team had planned. Adapting those light novels into a 1-cour show felt like a risky plan and they didn\u2019t manage to capitalize. It\u2019s a series that\u2019s exciting to watch as a linear continuity but if you\u2019re interested in a well-developed story and characters, then look elsewhere. Too bad really. The show boasts a talented cast that kicked off with some wild entertainment before spiraling into disappointment with no looking back.",

            "content": "Overlord 2, written by Kugane Maruyama, Illustrated by So-bin.\r\nMy Review About Overlord Season 2 (Winter 2018) (Sorry for my bad english :( )\r\nIt contains some spoiler, Read with your own risk ^_^ .\r\n- Story 8/10 - :\r\nOverlord Season 2, comes with 13 Episode, Animated by Studio Madhouse.\r\nFirst Episode you can say it as Introduction about Overlord Season 2, Flashback about what is happening in Previous season, and preparation for the next Arc.\r\nOverlord Season 2, contain a \"World Building Arc\", where the side characters spawn more than the Main Characters and explain what happening with this Side Characters and their Story (it's kinda like every humanhave own Story of their life). If you still don't Understand about it, I recomended you to play RPG-Game first before watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nAt the beginning (Episode 2) we will redirect to Lizardman Arc. Lizardman Arc is one of the \"World Building Arc\" which is the last goal of Ainz Ooal Gown(or you can say The writter) to make a Country where all of Demi-humans can live together with Happiness (Including Dwarf, Lizardman, Elf and others).\\n\\n\r\nBack to the Story, this Lizardman Arc, show about how Lizardman live together, suffering about food, sacrifice others Lizardman using a War in order to reduce an overpopulated Lizardman. Everything you see in this 4 Episode mainly about Lizardman's Tribe. (Episode 2-5)\\n\r\nZaryusu Shasa is the Main Protagonist for this Arc, it ll explained well how he re-united all of the Lizardman's Tribe after the last war, found his Lover Crush Lulu, preparing a war agains Nazarick, Killing Iguva (Ainz Undead), and later killed by Cocytus and got revived.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story is good, its explained well from Viewpoint of Lizardman, nothing rushed in this Arc, it was same as Light Novel Story, I really love episode 3 where Zaryusu vs Iguva , and episode 4 where Ainz move like a Supreme being in front of Lizardmans. its kinda unique and interesting for me.\\n\\n\r\nMove to next story about Man In Kingdom 1 & 2 Arc(Episode 6-13), about this Arc im agree with some people that it rushed since they already wasting few episode focusing on Lizardman. but im not really worried about it, basically the main plot are still there and still explained carefully so the audience will not confused about it. this Arc will explore more about the characters on Re-Estize Kingdom (Climb,Renner,Blue Rose etc), and continuation of 'Sebas Story' (If you watch season 1 Sebas was sent by Ainz to Re-Estize Kingdom as a bait to find people who brainwashed Shalltear). \\n\r\nAbout this arch i really love Last 3 Episode, especially when Entoma vs Blue Rose and Ainz vs Jaldabaoth. its make me want to watch more of this anime. (and luckly they announced the Season 3).\\n\\n\r\nFor me the Story of Overlord season 2 is Very Good with this all of World Building.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Art : 8/10 -\\n\r\nAnimated by studio Madhouse, the Art is Great, the Colour, the Brightness the Graphic and the Blur Effect, Texture, and the some Side-effect mixed well, even in some scene the character face was changed a bit but it still acceptable since it doesnt change that much.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Sound : 7,5/10 -\\n\r\nI Love the Opening and the ending Song, the sound effect, and the Bg Music also well-played\\n\\n\r\n- Character : 8/10 -\\n\r\nThe World Building Arch explained well how the character grown up and their specific characteristics. it explore well how Zaryusu come as a Brave Warrior, how he has a feeling with Crush Lulu, you can even see their Sex scene !!, Crush lulu that always support him until the end.\\n\r\nthe 'Yandere' Princess Renner, Loyal Dog Climb, how the relation about Master-Servant was build among them. Sebas that have \"Touch-me settings\" inside him, Tsuareninya feeling througt Sebas, and also how Evileye fallen in love with Momon, Entoma's character was shown in this Season 2 as well, Sadistict Mare ,Brain Unglaus that face up his fear again Shalltear and a lot of it. it was Very Good and explained well in this Season.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment : 9/10 -\\n\r\nGreat !, im already Enjoyed this show since first Season, what makes me enjoy this show?. \\n\\n\r\n*This is a Dark show with a lot of Blood, Gore, where cut human's head is acceptable, its fit well for me. its also contains a Funny scenes, especially when Ainz-sama talking in his mind about what he need to do, or when the emotion taken away because he is Undead. its fun and refreshing.\\n\\n\r\n*The Master-Servant relationship between Ainz and his Guardians is also interesting, the Loyalty of the Guardian is so awesome, you can only find this relationship only when you watching Overlord (The Master-Servant relationship without any betrayal from both side). where they can accept each other, Hating anyone outside but Loves everyone inside 'Great Tomb of Nazarick', Believe that you can't betraying someone who gives you a life, the Truth about Loyalty, sometime it feels Heartwarming (If you watch last episode of Overlord Season 1).\\n\\n\r\n*There is less lovey-dovey scenes where the MC is surrounded with a lot of Girls who loving him, the only people loving Ainz is only Albedo !!!, yes Albedo !!, what about shalltear??? She is loving Ainz because of her fetish about Undead !!, so dont calculate her !!! :P , Evileye? ah She love Darkness \"Momon\" not our Supreme Lord Ainz-sama...(eventhough they are same xD)\\n\\n\\n\r\n*Non-idealistict show, its not the show where the MC trying to save everyone he met (especially girl), even its impossible, its also not the show where someone can gain Over Power when they are pressed..., this show teach you how to become more Realistic, what you can save and what you need to sacrifice in order to save someone, the difference between the Strong and the weak,Profit and loss, it also teach you even you are OP(Overpowered) you still need a plan boyo!\\n\\n\r\nThats the point why i enjoy this show, its a Great show for me.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall : 8,5/10 - \\n\r\nOverlord Season 2, a sequel of Overlord Season 1, was a good show, there is a lot point if you watching it carefully,If you think Overlord is Anime with full Action Genre then you completely wrong. it also have political scene and Drama like Anime \"Maou No Yuusha\" but with more soft scenes that make people understand what's going on, this anime will not fit for someone who searching a lot of fight and battle scenes. and this series need a continuation to connect all of the side and main event, thats why i recommended you to watch it properly. \\n\r\nBasically Overlord are different with some anime like SAO and Log Horizon. Overlord, Ainz and his NPC was Transported from Game World (YGGDRASIL game) to Another World (Isekai) called New World(NW), he cannot using the Game feature anymore right after transported to New World, he cannot logged out because of this, while SAO and Log Horizon still remain in their Game World(Trapped in Game World) and still able to using the Features of the game itself. Thats why they are searching the way to logged out from the Game. Some people are misunderstanding about this matter.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall for this show is 8,5 and it is Great, worth and enjoyable to watch.\\n",

            "content": "Review written at episode 4.  I have not read the light novel.  Will update nearer the end of the season.\r\ntl;dr: So far, worthless.\r\nWhether it be because the manga went through a slump, or whether Madhouse simply didn't try with this arc, the end result is terrible.  The character designs are uninspiring, the plot is boring, and the character interactions felt as though they'd been lifted from a template.  Compared to the first season, which I loved every moment of, this is abysmal.\r\nIs there anything that Madhouse did right?\r\nYes.  The moments where it paid attention to Shalltear's inner turmoil about whathappened at the end of last season, and the thought cocyutus put into his answers when interrogated by Ains were well done.  They may have been a tad obvious (shallow), but still appropriate and well executed.  However, these moments don't even account for a whole episode's worth of screen time.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, with the exception of the lizardmen, the characters are well-designed (and drawn) and the soundtrack is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSo what could Madhouse have done better?\\n\\n\r\n- If they really had no choice but to include all of this, they could have reformatted it into flashbacks.  The biggest problem with this garbage is that it's four episodes of continuous garbage.  If it were broken down into chunks, as could be done with a flashback, then it would be more tolerable.  As it is, it's just going to turn people away before it gets good.\\n\\n\r\n- Preferrably, though, don't include this rubbish in the first place.  There is a rather large amount of \"character development\" that serves no benefit to the story.  If said character development was done well, then this wouldn't be a problem, but it's heavy-handedness and outright sillyness simply makes the characters seem superficial.  Had Madhouse decided to distribute this arc through flashbacks, this would be the perfect excuse to remove all the lazy character development.  By starting off with \"these two are in a relationship\" then later clarifying on the important points of \"how it happened\", the majority of the uninteresting content could be cut, giving more time for the development of the interesting characters.\\n\\n\r\n* let me be clear, I am not a particular fan of flashbacks, I just support their appropriate use to remove periods of boredom or inactivity.\\n\\n\r\n- Alternatively, they could have simply put more effort into the first four episodes.  While some are hardcore fans of remaining true to the source, if the source contains a clearly sub-par section, minor, targeted revisions can be beneficial.  If this was merely a matter of madhouse not caring about these episodes and simply rushing them, then they've dug their own grave.\\n",

As example now- Iam overpowered I am king here no one can kill me muhahahaha yea IRL I am weak but in this game GOD!=Overlord season 1\\n\\n\r\nOverlord season 2\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10- the story has improved, the factions are displayed and what they do\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10- nothing changed\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10- the atmosphere is simply perfect\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10- the characters of each faction are told a bit\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10- not that feelings like in season 1 but still great\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10- great show, I hope there will be more series in the third season.\\n",

            "content": "Overlord is a Japanese light novel series that was written by Kugane Maruyama and illustrated by so-bin. It began serialization online in 2010, before being acquired by Enterbrain. Twelve volumes have been published since July 30, 2012. A manga adaptation by Satoshi Oushio, with art by Hugin Miyama, began serialization in Kadokawa Shoten's manga magazine Comp Ace from November 26, 2014. A 13-episode anime television series adaptation by Madhouse aired between July 7 and September 29, 2015. The second season ran from January 9 to April 3, 2018. A third season is planned for July 2018.\r\nOverlord is back. Now with 100% more lizard porn, agroup of adamantine class adventurers, a band of highly-class bloodthirsty thieves controlling many people, and a yandere princess. For those who already know what Overlord is about, I must say that the new season has not changed at all. It again takes the series some episodes to start the whole thing: you will be shown, let us say, a filler that is not that entertaining to watch. More than that, it is so bad that it might make you want to drop the second season. Fear not, if you do hate the filler, just skip it. All the fun starts afterward.\\n\\n\r\nOverlord did become much better because of its story-line and characters. Ainz Ooal Gown yet again continues his quest on becoming top class adamantine adventurer to collect enough information for Nazarick. Many things are still unexplained, but the second season also answers many questions that have not been answered in the first season. Character wise, many new characters have been introduced starting from the Nazarck servants and ending with many anti-heroes that have their interesting backgrounds for you to find out about. But this is, of course, not the best part about characters. What you will surely appreciate is the fact that many Nazarick\u2019s servants receive a ton of development. Indeed, I am not going to go into details, but I will say only one thing--you will love it. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Overlord is still one of the most epic series about MMORPG games. The second season offers you a more detailed look at Nazarick\u2019s servants and the enemies Ainz will have to face. I would highly recommend you start watching the anime right from the 6th episode; otherwise your opinion on Overlord might change because of it.",

(Long story short our boy Ainz just keeps on looking more and more OP)\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9 \\n\\n\r\nNot much to say other than pretty beautiful, nice little mix of sword/mage fighting and all looked really sleek and cool\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\\n\r\nThe music pretty much the same as season 1\\n\r\nEverything fits the mood, but other than the song started during the credits of the penultimate episode none of them left an imprint on my mind, so nothing special\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10 \\n\\n\r\nNow I love all this ridiculous character building they have done on just random individuals or groups around the world\\n\\n\r\nThey have a little warriors spirit saga with Cocytus and an odd little maid master gangs conundrum with Sebas, both polar opposite sort of feel but both really endeared me to these characters (specially Sebas)\\n\\n\r\nA lot of focus was also put on the humans Ainz had met and their companions, and they added a nice extra level of nerves to the show, as for a change you were routing for someone who wasn't all powerful, and actually might lose\\n\\n\r\nAlso I do have to do a little shout out, I wont name any names to prevent spoilers but I love that there seems to be the making of a Yuno Gasai 2.0 in the overlord world now (I'm a sucker for a Yandere)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\\n\r\nI love this show, and yes it's got a slight dark undertone to the anime but I think it's important when watching it not to take it too seriously\\n\r\nI don't believe this anime was made with the intention to be incredibly gritty and dark with a highly intelligent story\\n\r\nNo, but it is exciting, sometimes shocking, and I am always on the edge of my seat just waiting for that next ridiculous thing to happen\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think they done a good job, although the story could be seen as a little slow i feel like the extra scenes had their purpose and helped to build the world\\n\r\nI really hope, now that they have laid the groundwork they can press on and make season 3 something special\\n\\n\\n\\n",

As you watch this Anime you would be asking: Why cant he wiped out everyone and that's it? since our protagonist and their crew are like the strongest beings in there? Howeverif you watched carefully our Protagonist, even though is an undead is still a human being and as a Rational thinking person He is REALLY CAREFUL about doing something, Plus of the threat of someone having mind control which makes him more cautelous about acting reckless, Thus the slow progression of the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style is vey common yet Awesome the world feels lively and characters are well designed. I dont like the 3d-like effect they made with some fighting and specially in battle with skull soldiers, but that is just my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Everything is amazing here the Opening, Ending, the soundtracks they use in the story blends really well making it more exciting,sad,funny, depending on the situation. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I love some characters in here, However since there is so much characters some are left out and some takes all the screen times, Albedo takes really small screen time which you may forget about her, the first half of the anime you will only see Lizards man which is compresible why people did not like Overlord 2 since they are not our protaganist and still taking so much screen time. Still it was a nice Arc in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I CAN NOT STOP WATCHING THIS! there is something about Overlord that keeps you hooked. Just watching our strong protagonist force killing those bastard feels so satisfying. Just watching how omnipotent are they compared to the humans that feels so proudly, watching them giving justice to those bad guys is so enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Just give a little bit of patience and you will love it, The first 6 episodes are not really appealing because is about Lizard man which are ugly being and not to mention the IMPREGNATE ME part which was disgusting hahah. BUT after that it is so Fun to watch this, there is a lot of action, a lot of justice and understandable action from our protagonist, the music enhace the overall experience, Just wait until you see EP. 11 the masterpiece of the season, felt like a episodes written from Games of Thrones. So do not let some reviews fool you, you are missing out one of the best Anime this year!",

I love the storytelling and yes, not everything is about the mighty lord. I have nothing else to say about this anime, it's just good. Without spoiling anything, the second season actually focuses on side characters, to show their individual storylines. Though the mighty lord may have little influence on these characters, the show shows their personal experiences and what everyone is thinking about. This game is not just a game, it's really strategic and evenmighty lord cannot predict anything.",

The whole story can be divided into two parts (little bit of SAO feeling there), the lizardmen part and the princess part. They are not really related, I don't think they even mention the lizards after they are done with them. Or maybe they don't want to talk about them because of the thing they had to witness in the tent?\r\nThe characters are awesome and there is nothing else to say about them. I was basically fangirling (yes, that is aword) over Sebas and his style. The way he dealt with the bad guys was pure awesomeness.\\n\r\nThe story was well written but a little bit short.\\n\r\nI am really hyped about the next season.",

            "content": "Start slow and boring, but gradually getting more interesting towards the end. As a fans of 1st season of overlord, that's my impression after watching this. \r\nWithout spoil anything, overlord II consists of 2 arcs (just like the prequel). and I will tell you that first arc are slow and not so good, either story or action-wise. But it's building and contributing something to the plot, and one of them I've seen it already at 2nd arc. And maybe there are more to come in the next season (I really hope there will be 3rd season). But still, it would be better if they shortenthe 1st arc in just maybe 2-3 episodes, instead of 5. And I will tell you why next.\\n\\n\r\nNext let's talk about more interesting stuffs, the next arc offers a lot of good and promising developments. The story is quite interesting, and there are a lot of funny new characters too. Some are related to events in the 1st season, too bad the dangerous enemies (or should we called nation or organization) that gave Ains quite trouble before not properly updated here. but they still appear few times, that's pretty good too though it only increasing my curiosity. Aside from that, the 2nd arc provide more insight to Ains subordinates, like sebaz, cocytus, demiurge and that's nice to see. \\n\\n\r\nI would like to give more score if not for the short of episodes. There are a lot of things that I think it should be explained better and/or need longer introduction. The new characters sometimes just appeared randomly in the middle of events, and later we found that they're actually important characters. Some events switch randomly too because too much happening in the same time frame. That's even worse if you expects Ains get more screen times like I do, because he rarely appear throughout entire episodes, well.. he appeared a lot in the end though. What I want to say is, there should be more episodes, maybe they should make overlord 2 into 24-25 episodes. If not, they should just shorten the 1st arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe verdict is, overlord 2 still good to go, it's not better than the prequel though. Well, just endure the first few episodes if you just starting and bored. Overall overlord is good series, including season 1 this series can easily become my top isekai, game like, fantasy story. The concepts evil undead as protagonists is quite unique if I should say. Though Log Horizon still ranked above this, but I think it's plain rude to compare this to simple and brainless kid show like SAO. Please refrain to watch this if you just expect a lot of mindless actions and sappy love story. And I strongly recommend Overlord for those who like great fantasy anime inspired by game and have deep and interesting story and memorable characters.",

            "content": "There are some minor spoilers within from Overlord (season 1 and 2). It's nigh impossible to talk about it without giving away spoilers...\r\nBe warned please...\r\nAnother review of another anime but this time about Overlord - one of my favourite series of 2015. With was my sixth anime since my return to anime world I really enjoy it. \r\nIt was what I wanted. A series that connected to me since I read a lot of Warhammer & 40K. I wanted to watch some anime that focus on an evil character and this was it. \r\nI love it so much that I even bought the Light Noveland I was really surprised that the first season comprised of the first and second light novels and they made it so good.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season focus on Lord Ainz Ooal Gown or Momon who was trapped inside a game BUT DON'T WORRY - this is not SAO. This is more adult, more dark more epic if you like.\\n\\n\r\nAfter finish the first season I quickly try other animes out there (focus on this premise of trapped within a video game or even Isekai but this one is probably my favourite (closely followed by Konosuba)).\\n\\n\r\nWhen I learn that a second season was coming I was excited and true to be told is not as good as the first season. Why, you ask. Well, the first season focus a lot on our main character and the tower they live giving some background on the NPC that live and serve the tower of Nazarick (This in the first 6 episodes).  The next 6 episodes focus a lot on Momon with the help of Narberal as he explores the nearby city and trying to understand how things work (and how different they are from the game).\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile in the second season, the first six episodes follows a LOT of lizardman (some random guys who live nearby the tower) and what the plans are for them. Here we have a lot of interaction on Cocytus (Guardian of 5th floor) and somewhat in Demiurge (Guardian of 7th floor). The second part of the series focus again on Sebas (a buttler of Nazarick) and other non-related characters of Nazarick like Climb (nice name); evileye (last three episodes), Lakyus, Lord Stronoff, Gagaran, Tia, Brain\\n\\n\r\nMy main question is this... WHERE IS ALBEDO???? :) Yeah... there is almost no Albedo. Combining she has what? 5 lines throughout the season?\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the anime we learn that there is power people (well, to Nazarick standards they are like helpless ants) that rule E-Rantel and Momon wants to be a hero and so he with the help of Demiurge and the other Nazarick captains and Pleiades make that happen with some ruse that made some of the most awesome battles I've seen in anime.\\n\\n\r\nI know some people dislike the trope (I do as well) of over-powerful characters like in SAO or Smartphone or Death March BUT here it works because even if he is over-powerful it's not the even the focus on the anime (I mean battles and such). This anime focus a lot on politics and it's what I call High Fantasy (or Epic) like Game of Thrones (minus the sex). It's all about the characters (all of them) and not only Momon. True be told in the second season he appears only in the last two or three episodes. Even Sebas or Demiurge are ovepowerful but the way the artists and writer wrote made them interesting, even if before the battle you already know he or she is going to win. That's why this anime works. The writing skill of the creator. That's why SAO sucks. Because the writer makes all about the main character and made it all too easy - the other characters exist only to give more focus on our main. In Overlord that doesn't happen at all. \\n\\n\r\nThat ending left me wanting for more...WHAT A FIGHT between Momonga & Demiurge (they are still master and peer but - a ruse) Who the heck is that Princess Renner... She looks kawaii and scary as shit!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you want a dark epic anime, this is it. If you want an evil main character this is it. There are some hints in his monologue in the last episode that hints to that (well throughout the series he always did what we would considered evil BUT in this context it's acceptable... only by watching you would understand...) There is blood and fighting that last 10m per episode. There is comedy as well. Every NPC (Nazarick captains and Pleiades) are different. I really enjoy this show and I hope it doesn't take two years two have a third season.\\n\\n\r\nSo, why 8 instead of 9 or 10? Well first of all - NO ALBEDO! eheh and  because some episodes, even if they gave a bit of wide information about the world, it was very sparse and the story really didn't jump forward that much. I think the first 6 episodes were sub-par and in moments I thought this was another anime because the main characters are the lizards. I know the purpose was to give us more info on other races/places but they over do it. The last 6 episodes with Sebas and Demiurge were way better and I would have given a 10 without any question asked... so 6 and 10 divided it's equal 8 eheh",

            "content": "After Overlord's first season, full of badass characters and shows of power by Ainz, second season had a pretty rough start. Focus shifted from Nazarick to side characters, with Ainz and co. taking a back seat. Without a doubt, such change will disappoint people who watched this anime because of OP main cast.\r\nStill, it doesn't mean second season itself is bad. It's just different. Story moves from introducing Nazarick faction (first season) to outside world. Now we see lives of humans (and lizards) of Yggdrasil and Nazarick's actions from their perspective. And it rather is nice thing to see, especially when they actually show theirpower.\\n\r\nI'll agree with many opinions that first arc was weak. It was far too long for what happened during it. And while 2nd arc is much more reasonable, the last few episodes more than make up for everything bad in previous 2/3 of anime.\\n\\n\r\nNew characters introduced in 2nd season are an interesting bunch. Yeah, lizards are forgettable, I won't talk about them. But whole Blue Rose, especially Evileye and Lakyus, Unglaus and of course Renner, are really good characters that don't make you just wait for Ainz's appearance.\\n\r\nThis season also brought considerable development for Nazarick NPC's and shown their loyalty to Ainz.\\n\\n\r\nI've never watched this anime for its art or music, but I have to admit those were good. If you skip openings then don't. This one is solid.\\n\r\nWhile fight scenes aren't that special, they are pretty enjoyable. Animation is good and moves make sense. I'd even say there were some above average fights in this season.\\n\\n\r\nGenerally speaking, if you liked first season, you won't regret watching second one. You might not like it at first, or even be disappointed after finishing, but it's still a good anime. Don't get discouraged by slow start.",

He wondered in season 1 whether there was another like himself in the new reality, and to counteract against such possibilities, he conquers land and takes up missions to make himself rest assured. This season seems to show just a small portion of his overall longer quest than what one season can afford to show - that's the impression I get; a person who read the light novels might know better.\\n\r\nBut rest assured, it is actually quite interesting to see the lizards cower in fear (sort of) before the almighty Ainz Ooal Gown. To see the lizards be so overpowered by just one of Momonga's servants is very satsifying and entertaining.\\n\r\nI didn't like the art. The depiction of a particular icy sword was horrible and childish, and the drawing quality was low tier.\\n\r\nThe OSTs and OPs and performance of the voice actresses are part of the Sound category. Nothing too remarkable or horrible in there. EDs and OPs sound fine. OST I don't remember. VAs do their job.\\n",

While the beginning story of the Lizardmen was the usual quality that comes from Overlord, especially the final battle, it was the transition into the Eight Finger's storyline that brought this season down a few notches.  \r\nThe primary problem is that too much attention was focused on Climb and Tuare, who were easily the most vanilla characters in the entire anime.  A young earnest boy who wants to be stronger and an innocent girl traumatized by the brutality of her world.  Theseare overdone tropes in anime, so it was a bit disappointing that so much of this season focused on them, when literally every other character on the show is more interesting.  The thing that saved the middle portion of the season was just how cool Sebastian is as a character.  \\n\\n\r\nThe battle in the capital was also entertaining, but, its not the kind of thing that should end a season because there was no true sense of danger there considering the circumstances surrounding the clash.  \\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, there was much to enjoy about this season of Overlord.  As usual, the villains of Nazarick are entertaining to watch, the action was good, and there were some surprising moments and a few swerves.

            "content": "About a year ago, the anime community and myself were both surprised and glad that Overlord was getting a second season. This was shocking because Madhouse, the studio behind the first season, has a track record for creating one and done seasons that leave us wanting more, encouraging us to seek out and read the original material. Now with this sequel and another season of One Punch Man yet to come, it looks like Madhouse are starting to break their own tradition and create additional seasons. The question is though, was it worth it? It has been two and a half years since the firstseason started airing and now with the second season having ended its run, was it worth the wait? \\n\\n\r\nWell I'm about to tell you. Sit back, relax and check what what you are sitting on isn't Kinky, as I present to you the anime review for Overlord II. Lets begin. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story takes place pretty much right where we left off from season 1 (like it never left us) with Momonga (or Ains Ooal Gown) having gathered information of the areas around him, plans to establish and expand Nazerick in this world that he is still stuck in. From there the story has two arcs that are each set in different locations. The first arc focuses on the tribal lives of native Lizardmen and how Ains wants to subjugate then to do his bidding. Whereas the second arc takes place in the royal capital and focuses more on an underground syndicate known as the Eight Fingers. These two arcs are used to establish what is sort of the purpose of the second season, world building. We are already established with Ainz and we know who he is and what his goals are so why not expand the world outside Nazerick to focus on areas that are going to be affected by his presence. As such the arcs are used to establish characters in those areas of the world and expand on some of Ains' followers. \\n\\n\r\nNow this is a good thing because we didn't know much of the world in the first season so having a second season expanding the world does alleviate some of the criticism that the first season had. But the second season establishes factions and characters that we don't get to see beyond the the first opening minutes of the first episode. So it isn't perfect. Likewise in order to keep you up to date with that particular area of the world, there is a lot of dialogue that explains current events and events that have happened before Ains' arrival. I'm not gonna lie, some of these dialogues going back and forth between these characters can be longer than they should be; making it boring to listen to after a few minutes and can make you tune out. But thankfully, there are some moments that do intrigue you and help you get to know this world and its inhabitants better. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSince we are pretty much established with Momonga, I will not be entirely focusing on him. Instead, I will be focusing on the characters that this season establishes. \\n\\n\r\nSo I said that this season focused more on Ains' followers. Well the followers that were focused on were Cocytus and Sebas in the first and second arc respectively. So lets start with Cocytus. Cocytus is a warrior, an honourable warrrior at that who has respect for other warriors who he deems worthy of earning his respect. He is also a bit of a single minded character who doesn't see the big picture and relying on characters like Demiurge for advice. Honestly, his character isn't that unique outside of proud warrior with an unshaken loyalty to Ains. Despite him being the focus of the all of Ains' servants in the first arc, his character isn't all that interesting. It is like he is built up to be this deadly warrior that the Lizardmen have no hope to beat. Speaking of the Lizardmen, it is surprising how much development they get. We see how they live and their traditions, all in the eyes of one Lizardmen, Zaryrusu Shasha. Zaryrusu is an outcast, opting to travel rather than to stay with the tribe. But when Ains starts knocking on the Lizardmen's door, he opts to unite the Lizardmen together to fight back. It's from there that we see the lives of the Lizardmen and how they live. In all honestly, seeing these events from the Lizardmen's perspective made me care for them more than I should have. Even though I knew their eventual fate, it was still entertaining to see what happens because I grew to like these characters, even with the romance angle between two Lizardmen being super awkard. \\n\\n\r\nNow Sebas is defiantly the more interesting character of the two mainly due to the people he encounters who also play quite a big role in the second arc. Simply put, Sebas is a gentleman. A character who has morals and is the most caring out of all of Ains servants, despite his actions make the people around him suspicious of treachery, even though he has shown unquestionable loyalty. We see this through him taking care of a girl who was casted aside and we see how much of a gentleman he can be. Of course he then runs into the Eight Fingers and just shows how much of a badass Sebas is. This causes him to encounter some of the characters the we get plenty of screen time for, mainly Climb. Climb is a character like Sebas, who has an unshakeable loyalty and has selfless morals. He may be not that great with a sword, but he has unquestionable determination and lack of fear because of his duty to bodyguard the Princess of the royal capital, Princess Renner. This is a double edge sword however. While his loyalty and determination makes him a character that is liked and respected by people around him, it also makes him blind to the Princess' intentions as her personality gets more......interesting as the show goes on, with an interesting smile to boot (gives me shivers just thinking about it). \\n\\n\r\nIt is nice to see characters outside of Nazerick getting personalities rather than being blank characters with names for Ains and co. to slaughter. It makes the world  seem more vibrant and seeing it from their perspective helps to establish characters that will eventually cross paths with Ains. That doesn't mean Ains is dropped from the picture as we see him trying to keep his Overlord persona by expanding and conquering his kingdom while also maintaining the loyalty of his followers. It is clear he cares for them because they remind him of his former guild members and doesn't want to doubt their loyalty although he will do what needs to be done to maintain his image. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nNow back in 2015, Overlord, while still having good animation, didn't really live up to Madhouse's standards. This was mainly due to the fact that Madhouse had a tight schedule with their releases so cuts had to be made in some places. I bring this up because it really doesn't feel like the animation has changed much. While there is notable up in animation in the fight scenes, it really doesn't feel like much has changed. This could be because Madhouse split the budget between Overlord II and the other Madhouse anime that aired in the winter season, Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card-hen. But like I said earlier, Overlord season 1 still had good animation and still applies here. It still animates well and there is still detail in the world but I feel disappointed that not much has changed. \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDo you like orchestral music? You should, because you will be hearing a bunch of it. The music from Overlord season 1 has pretty much carried over to season 2 which is actually rather nice. If it ain't broke don't fix it. Whether Ains' theme is playing in the background whenever he does something awesome or when something bad happens to \"Ains and co.\"'s opponents and the music is like \"oh s***, you're f*****.\" There is one new track that stands out to me and it is a sombre, quiet piece played when Princess Renner goes into one of her interesting personality moments. It sets an atmosphere really well and amplifies that aspect of Renner.  \\n\\n\r\nThe opening \"Go Cry Go\" by OxT is interesting to me mainly because I didn't get into it until I listened into it more. It's one of those openings that grows on you and you like it over time. Altough I don't know why this anime opening is obsessed with tilting heads. Like every character has to tilt their head in this opening. But if I have to choose to listen between this opening and the Season 1 opening \"Clattanoia.\" I probably choose Clattanoia. Go Cry Go didn't really impress me with its visuals as it is just a lot of the same imagery but with different characters. Clattanoia looked and sounded more fun which was appropriate for the kind of anime that we were watching. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending didn't impress me although I like the subtle changes of imagery as the show went on. \\n\\n\r\nMy feelings towards the dub are about the same as I felt about Seasons 1's dub. Besides Chris Guerrero's performance as Momonga (which was brilliant by the way), the performances for the dub characters were rather meh. Probably because the performance of Ains was that good due to him sounding like an evil Overlord with a voice that makes him imposing and is always planning something like a villain would. Although I did enjoy the performance of Bryan Massey as Cocytus since he gives Cocytus a more vocal range than his sub counterpart. But if I had the choice, i would probably listen to this anime in sub. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nSo I will bring up this question earlier, \"Was it worth the wait?\" Well considering that we had to wait almost two and a half years for a sequel we didn't think we would be getting. I would say sort of yes. While this sequel expands the world and its inhabitants, it isn't all clean cut and there are problems. There is also the disappointment of only slight improvement in animation quality, but I still enjoyed it and that what it really comes down to. I expected an enjoyable sequel and I got an enjoyable sequel. \\n\\n\r\nIt ain't finished though. There is still plenty of ground to cover in the overarching plot as areas of the world are still yet to be expanded upon. Thankfully, we are getting a new season this summer which is good news. It feels like the plot is getting really interesting and needs a continuation. So I will be looking forward to that but for now, I will enjoy what I got. \\n\\n\r\nMy Personal Enjoyment: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall score:  7.8/10   Recommendation: Watch it",

If you said that all of them are unneeded character then its a big mistakes. Later all of this arch will be connected each other(if you read the LN or if they make it into another season), and ofc there is no harem or something like that in this second season. \r\n  Maybe Overlord is the only Isekai with a Anti-Hero/villain protagonist. and if you are a gamer you will know thefeeling when the Main Character is the kind of Last Boss from the game itself.\\n\r\n Comparing Overlord with SAO or LogHorizon just because they have same genre \"Trapped in Game World\" is ridiculous, same genre doesnt means have a same plot, Momonga was trapped alone in a New World together with his NPC (Master - Servant relationship). he was trapped as a lv 100 player, thats why he become OP \\n\r\nAbout the writing skill?? oh come on Overlord Light novel won a Kono Light Novel ga Sugoi in 2017, Overlord Light Novel was the best selling light novel series of 2015. so no need to doubt it. the Anime BD sales was success with 12.000 copy for only 1 volume on 2015. what i can say is, let the result speak.\\n\r\nAlso did you guys noticed that almost all popular anime got bad hatred review on the top, while overrated anime got a lot of good reviews? xD, yup popular show have hatred reviews means they are popular enought to get attention from those guys, how can? as you can see they make a bad and loooong review, they can wrote the details itself from the anime, isnt it make a sense they are caring about the show? they even watching it until last episode, ehhhh, if the show is bad i ll not watching it until the end and will dropped it as soon as possible....... xDDD\\n\r\nIf it's your first time reading reviews on MAL , here i will give you an advice :\\n\\n\r\n-Overrated Anime : a lot of good review with good score like 8,9,10, and all of them are in top reviews, you will see a less people giving score under 5,\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Popular Anime : there is a top review with a score like 1,2,3,4, and with bad and looooonnnnngggg review just to get the attention \\n\\n\\n\r\nThank you :)\\n",

            "content": "That OP song is wonderful though.\r\nStory: Overlord\u2019s story is, in my opinion, one of the better isekai genre stories of recent years. It manages to not fall into too many unbearable clich\u00e9s and the few that it does have are played off well enough to feel enjoyable, and at times as if a fresh take was applied to the same old idea. Overlord II is no different, as we see the return of our villains in the long-anticipated sequel. The story of Overlord II manages to improve on its predecessor by speeding up the pacing, and taking a step back from the main character, Ainz.Instead choosing to focus on the Guardians and civilian(ish) characters and telling their stories. It manages to cover a similar amount of source material as the first season, but much more seems to be happening and we are even gifted with some character development from the Guardians of Nazarick. With the method that this series has decided to take in this season, Ainz is now appearing to be the powerful and all-seeing overlord to the audience as well, not just the characters. The story arcs centralise around a Guardian\u2019s exploits, and none of them overstay their welcomes. Unfortunately, at times there were some unneeded or, built-up and then irrelevant plot points, so I will reduce the score to an 8/10 for story (more of a 7.5, rounded to an 8).\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: Overlord II has cool character designs that are almost always well-drawn, the animation is usually quite fluid and the use of CGI in some scenes, especially the battle scenes works very well. There are a couple instances of unfortunate CGI throughout the show, as well as some animation issues with background characters, but as a whole it is well done and smooth. Unfortunately, I do not have the best eye for animation and art (nor the best ear for sound), so anything I say should be taken as someone with no experience in either field, and only a general statement of the overall quality. I am giving Overlord II an 8/10 for art/animation (Raw: 8.4).\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound for this anime was definitely good. The voice acting never felt too forced or unfortunate otherwise, and the sound direction was very well done. The music, whilst not being wholly unique, was well orchestrated (pun not intended) and always help accentuate the moments that they were a part of, enriching the experience as a whole. The OP song was really good (this is more of a side note) and the animation used in it (bit off topic) matched up very well and was done almost perfectly, in my opinion an improvement over OP 1 (they graduated from standing in a void, to walking with a background) (I am now ready for the riots of the OP 1 fans). Overall, I\u2019m giving this category a raw 8.5, and personally rounding up to a 9, but objectively will round it down to an 8, as my personal preferences of music shouldn\u2019t bump up the score.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This category has also seen a marginal improvement from the earlier season, as the audience is now shown the goings-on of characters other than the big man himself, Ainz. As previously stated, this allows for more character development and explores the motivations and personalities of the previously 2D Guardians. They are now fleshed out, and unlike the first season, the antagonists have now also had some of their own development, as they now appear to be actual human beings (except for, like, the Lizardmen). As always the character designs were as cool as ever, and some of the new additions were believable and understandable. There were a couple let downs here and there with my expectations for characters, and it was disappointing that the series did not innovate with them as much as I had wanted to, but overall, I\u2019m giving Overlord II an 8/10 for its characters (more of a 7.5, rounded to an 8).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is the part where my personal preferences CAN bump up the score. Using an amalgamation of all of my past points throughout this review, I would give this a solid 9/10 for enjoyment. This series was the one that I looked forward to the most each week from its season, and I never felt the need to skip the OP (meaning the OP was good and the show wasn\u2019t unbearable). Personally, I am an Overlord fan and thus, this specific point may have a bit of bias, but I would like to believe that the rest of the review does not. The animation was appealing, the Albedo\u2026 fan service\u2026 was dialled back a bit from the previous season, I got to see more of the other Guardians (and unfortunately more of Demiurge, I honestly have no real reason to hate him, he just rubs me the wrong way) that I really enjoyed. Personally I think S3 should feature more of Best Girl Delta, but I know that is merely a pipe-dream. All in all, I really did enjoy this, and now that I\u2019m done trying to annoy as many people as possible with me \u2018personal preferences\u2019, I\u2019ll move on with the review.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overlord II is getting a raw 8.1 from me, landing it on a solid 8/10 overall score. Taking into account all of its flaws, and all of its achievements, I believe this is a fair score. The last season would be pushing the 8 I gave it ( more of a high 7), but this 8 was earned. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the first season (of course), and anyone who would like to witness one of the better recent isekais. Yes, it does have flaws and clich\u00e9s, but they are handled well (and y\u2019know, the characters do have some personality to them, even if Ainz can occasionally get a bit 2D) and I\u2019m really looking forward to the upcoming season 3. That\u2019s my final word on the topic, I hope I was helpful.\\n",

            "content": "I'm very glad that Mad House decided to make a sequel to the first Overlord Season with this Season 2. I'm pleased with how it all went, from the first episodes to the end.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nThis season chooses to focus more on the side characters rather than on the main character, Momonga. There's obviously going to be some doubts regarding these turn of events, but don't worry. This is actually a good thing, we get to see character development in new characters, as well as from a few characters that we were introduced to in the first season but never really got around to actually seeingthem much.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the main story surrounding this sequel does feel a bit wonky in its progression. There's one arc that doesn't get much attention, therefore making it not as good as the other arcs explored throughout the anime, and the beginning to the mid-end feels clunky overall. It's not until the last four episodes or so that I actually begin really enjoying this anime. That isn't to say that it wasn't entertaining before that, I was just a bit disappointed with the execution of the storytelling. Still good enough in this department.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters are still as entertaining in this season just as much as they were in the first. Even without Momonga not being present most of the time, we still have a bit of character development from Sebas, Cocytus, and a few other characters that weren't delved deep into in the first season, and it makes up for this absence exceedingly so. The new characters introduced in this sequel also helped in bringing up the suspense and hype that the Overlord anime franchise has been able to do so well, and that also really strengthens my liking towards this growing anime series. Not to mention, Momonga gets a new member into his harem. Haha... yeah. Eight out of ten.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation is just about the same here when compared to its predecessor, although there has been a vast improvement in the combat and action scenes, mainly the CGI getting better which provides more smooth fighting sequences. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nOh boy, did I love this anime's soundtrack. While the Opening and the Ending don't really provide much relation to the actual anime itself, it still manages to bring out the awesomeness and hype that you'll get from watching it. And it so rightfully deserves that. Both songs are very entertaining in their own right, and both OxT and Myth&Roid have made me proud. I mean, I'm listening to the two songs right now as I'm writing this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nThis anime really relies on hype to make us watch more, and coupled with the action and humor, there's no doubt that I really enjoyed Overlord 2 so much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nThis did not disappoint. I really loved watching each episode and the ending was really, really good, albeit kind of rushed. Despite some pacing issues, I enjoyed what this sequel had to offer. I'm looking forward to a third season without a doubt. With all my heart, I recommend this very much. If you want some badass characters, funny humor, and a very entertaining watch overall, then this is not for you. Just kidding. Watch it.",

In fact, I\u2019m actually writing this review at work right now. It wasn\u2019t always this way, though. I was actually a little concerned after watching the first couple of episodes back in January.\r\nOverlord II is primarily a world-building season. That's great if you like seeing minor characters get significant screen time. Not so much if you're a fan of one of the previously establish characters that becomes less relevant because of it. While hesitant at first, I\u2019m now convinced this was the rightapproach to take. The story is written in such a way that by the season finale I found myself actually caring about many of the \u201cextras\u201d despite their overall weakness relative to the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nAside from a few ugly bits of CGI, the quality of animation is on par with what we've come to expect from Madhouse. If you liked the first season, there\u2019s no reason you shouldn\u2019t at least give Overlord II a try. I mean, Madhouse did.",

            "content": "No fear, no spoilers are here.\r\nWhen I heard that a second season for Overlord was coming to town I was nothing short of overjoyed, because I did not really think that I would get another chance of seeing Ainz Ooal Gown in action unless I wanted to resort to the manga. In addition to the fact that Madhouse, at the time that Overlord was produced, wasn\u2019t exactly known for creating follow up seasons for some of their titles. Hence, my optimism regarding another season of Overlord popping up was rather low, and that\u2019s putting it mildly. Though, at the time, I reveled in the factthat I was proven wrong and the anime was given a chance to continue. The thought of seeing Ainz and the bunch on screen put a huge smile on my face, that is until the show actually began.\\n\\n\r\nLet me ask you this, what drew you to the show? What made you like Overlord to begin with? On the surface it is just another Isekai. A show about some random otaku who gets sucked into a role-playing game and is thrust directly into battle as some overpowered character. So, what made it so attractive? Sure, the world was interesting because it was filled with mystery and exploring what secrets are hidden within this new environment, along with understanding the economic and political systems that govern this land are all great prospects on their own. However, I loved the show because the main character (AINZ OOAL GOWN), along with his lovable bunch, were so unique and enjoyable. They were the prime reason that made this anime stand out from other Isekai for me. Ainz's monologues made him seem relatable, human, funny, and above all normal. I loved the fact that he was ambitious and was portrayed as an antihero, but at the same time maintained a sense of morality, plus he didn\u2019t let things get to his head too quickly. You can see him testing what he can and cannot do or what can and cannot get away with, and you can visibly notice the conflict that is occurring inside him, having to continuously keep up this undead supreme ruler persona in front of his servants, which obviously differs from what his true personality is like. Moreover, his character seems far different from that of normal Isekai protagonists; he never goes about creating a harem and never prioritizes his love affairs (though this might have to do with the fact he is an undead, though I am not quite sure). Add to that a group of wacky, funny, and compulsive set of servants, whom were all interesting in their own right, and you get a show that was capable of being entertaining, engaging, and comical all at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nNow mind you, most of these elements continue to exist throughout this second season, though at very scarce amounts. The screen time for all these characters gets cut down substantially, to the point that I began wondering if Ainz, Albedo, and the other guardians like Demiurge and Shalltear were actually still the main characters. What ticked me off the most was that, whenever you would think that the show had finally shifted its focus onto one of the original cast, it would almost instantly switch its attention to somewhere or someone else. This occurred whenever Ainz or one of the original cast members entered combat with another person; the footage would be abruptly interrupted and would be diverted somewhere else only to return when the fight was almost done. The only exception to this was Sebas who actually had more time dedicated to him than almost all other guardians combined, hell maybe even more than Ainz himself. Now he isn\u2019t a bad character of course and I felt that through him we got a glimpse of the potential that all guardians have to develop and evolve into unique and interesting characters that would make the show even more engaging in the future. In addition to the fact that we got to experience how the values of the original creator of each guardian continue to persist within them and help shape them into who they are. They no longer feel the same as the servants displayed in season 1 who follow their master without second thought or are devoid of any features asides from the ones that their creators had transcribed to them. It felt at times as though I am watching a show about the development of artificially intelligent beings and how they may perhaps eventually break free of their makers whom they had previously revered or worshiped as gods. However, to be frank, for me, Sebas is probably the least interesting character out of all of guardians, which diluted the excitement for me, and the characters that were around him were devoid of any significance and were simply plain or perhaps even awful. This second season was so oversaturated with side characters who I didn\u2019t care for, that I thought I was watching Fate/Aporcypha; and to make matters worse you are never given a chance to actually get invested in them anyways, since both arcs felt half-baked. For example, the show never goes back to revisit the characters who were introduced in the lizard arc, which diminishes the significance of their existence. \\n\\n\r\nHence, the major issues with this sequel occurred because far too many characters were introduced for the sake of expanding the show beyond Nazarick, causing the anime to transition at a very quick rate. Introducing new characters and expanding upon the secrets of Yggdrasil was something that was going to occur eventually and was something I was excited for, but the way it was executed felt rushed and left a lot to be desired. I simply did not see enough of the outside world or leant enough about the people with in it to truly care. The show for me shined whenever the focus shifted from the lackluster political game that was shown, to the original cast. I personally could never get enough of Ainz, Albedo, Shalltear, Cocytus, and the twins Aura and Mare.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the animations remains, for the most part, unchanged from the first season and has perhaps slightly improved, though CGI elements were introduced to the show; something which is perhaps becoming the new norm. The OST of the show was fine overall, with the best piece of music in the show being the ending, which I never skipped. Though, the opening of the first season was far superior to this.\\n\\n\r\nI truely hope that season 3 capitalizes on the potential that this show has to offer, because, despite being disappointed, my affinity and enthusiasm for this show has yet to vanish.\\n",

            "content": "STORY: 1\r\nI'd like to begin by asking the following: What story? What exactly is this show about? Season 1 of Overlord couldn't really make up its mind either, but at least it was an enjoyable time enough for me to not mind. In fact, I marathoned all of Season 1 faster than I have ever watched an anime before in my life. Season 2 of Overlord got lost in a rabbithole.\r\nAfter Momonga becomes a part of his MMORPG, but is simultaneously transported to a different setting (starting to get a little convoluted, but it's workable), he decides to do... Well, it's not really clear. Heeventually decides to spread the name of his guild across the lands with the hope that someone else from his MMORPG is there also, which is a rather weak goal for an entire series to hinge on. BUT! Earlier he considers taking over the world as an evil overlord since he and his crew of NPCs have all the powers they acquired in the game while the people of the world they find themselves in are comparably weak. It would be the same as waking up in DragonAge Origins as your max-level character from World of WarCraft.\\n\\n\r\nThe problems start right out the gate because Momonga doesn't want to start a conflict he can't win, so is very slow and deliberate, scouting the world to see what powers he might be up against and if other players like himself are there. This grinds the pacing down to less than a crawl. The fact that Momonga can't be sure if he's 100% invincible in this world is an artificial barrier that prevents the story from pumping along at a nice even pace. More importantly though, while much is cut out from the original light novels, I believe much more should have been cut. For example, most events (in both seasons) take several episodes to complete when they could be done in just one, (mostly by removing extraneous dialogue that accomplishes nothing), making that event more impactful and freeing up time for more character development and story progression. It would bother those who have read the light novels since they would know just how much was excluded, but it would be necessary for the sake of making the adaptation into an anime even slightly functional. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing problems carry on in Season 2 but are far worse. We never really know what the story is about because we don't see Momonga or his crew enough to stay saddled onto the overarching story. We divert to new characters as they rally to defend their homes from an invasion by Momonga's forces. That may sound interesting, but it's not. Seeing the conflict from the lizards' perspective (they're lizardmen, by the way) could be good, but it's jarring to focus on them so completely when this isn't their story to tell. This is Momonga's story of how he slowly learns more about the setting and, we assume despite him never really confirming it's actually his ambition, take over the world. This season doesn't allow us to follow along with that premise because we get bogged down in the immediate plot and endless and awkwardly written info dumps about history that really doesn't matter going forward, and could be safely left out, freeing up time for more interesting and relevant world building.\\n\\n\r\nAs we continue in Season 2, we shift focus to another series of new characters that aren't all that interesting as they go about their generic lives. They all have goals and pasts to tell, but none of it is relevant to the story of Momonga (presumably) taking over the world.\\n\\n\r\nJust as an aside, I must mention the indecisiveness of the character of Momonga. He never really decides to be a villain protagonist. Even until the end of Season 2 he is only acting in small ways to gain resources and information and otherwise just react to events rather than causing them. He doesn't clearly act towards a greater goal, and many times appears to go out of his way to not be a villain. It's hard to describe, but it's like the writer couldn't make up his mind what kind of character he wanted Momonga to be. Does he want to be an evil overlord? Does he want to be a compassionate ruler who all the people love? We really need to stick to one or the other so we can have a unified point to the story.\\n\\n\r\nI could ramble at length about the utter atrocity Overlord Season 2 is in the story and plot department, but I'll leave it here for now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: 8\\n\\n\r\nI've seen talk of the art quality going down and up and being overall bad through the middle of Season 2, but I didn't notice it. It looks quite nice to me, but doesn't have the flair for a higher score.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 5\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is there. The music works, but it's very generic. Some of the pieces are overdramatic and it makes me roll my eyes. Sometimes less is more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 1\\n\\n\r\nWhat characters? We rarely see the protagonist, Momonga. The scenes with his crew of other main characters (that we didn't really get established in Season 1 but we loved all the same just because we appreciated them being there and the promise of new and interesting interactions when they got to make their debut in the story) are similarly shafted in favour of bland, generic characters that, in some cases, are simply frustrating to watch. Characters like Stronof or Climb (what a name...) are the embodiment of NPC. No one has ever wanted to know the entire life story of an NPC. A little background is nice, little humanizing moments are great, but giving so much focus on characters that can't drive the story forward (think Yamcha) and are boring anyway, is an awful decision for the writer and doubly bad for the team who adapted the source material. It's a season of anime that you weren't sure you were even going to make, and without any certainty that there would be a Season 3. You can cut these characters or at least give them less screentime without having to worry about needing them later. Just look at the lizardmen for example. We got all that development for them, but does it pay off with them doing something later in the season? Nope.\\n\\n\r\nIt's been said side-characters are what's interesting and important about Overlord. This is absolutely mind-baffling. Side-characters are great! Do you remember Jeremiah Gottwald from Code Geass? I DO! But he was also interesting from his first appearance, which is something Overlord can't do with its side-characters to save its life. The show is trying to reassure us with each episode that these characters will be important later, which I doubt, but regardless, they're worthless now. And even if they do become important later, they're still only side-characters and should never overshadow the main cast when it's not their time to steal the scene completely, otherwise what's the point of having a main cast or protagonist at all?\\n\\n\r\nI'm not saying the main characters have to be in every scene, but if they are quite literally absent from the show, not even being in some way related to the events that are being portrayed onscreen, then you're doing it wrong. They aren't really main characters if that's the case. If the show is about the setting and showing it off, then don't have main characters. Make it an anthology series.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 1\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is a sin. Most the characters aside from the main cast (which you can largely rename Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Anime) are cringe. The dialogue is trite and redundant and forced. Every episode is a 'build-up' episode but without there ever being an equal payoff. Characters are dumb sometimes which strains our ability to stay invested. For example, Sebastian and Solution are going to leave their recon assignment but first they have to go on an errand - \"Better leave the human girl who's completely defenseless and also wanted by the mob completely alone for a long period of time so she can get kidnapped, otherwise the rest of the season's plot wouldn't happen!\" It's contrived.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the action! Oh, the action... One isn't automatically an action junkie for demanding SOMETHING happen that we can all be invested in at constant intervals. All we get is extended dialogue scenes between two or more characters who we don't really care about on a subject that we don't really care about because it doesn't relate to the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nWhen we do get fight scenes they're abysmal. The characters just shout names of attacks and stuff happens, usually after a transmutation circle appears. Then they stop to talk. Then someone else comes and they all stop to talk. Then the new guy fights the other guy calling out names of attacks, usually accompanied by transmutation circles, then they stop to talk again, then the fight's over. It's not the definition of heart-pounding, I'm telling you now.\\n\\n\r\nOne reason I keep seeing why there's so much dialogue and time spent without the main characters is because the show is trying to do world building. While I'll agree that's what it's trying and succeeding to do, it's doing it wrong. Completely disengaging from the overarching story is bad. Completely disengaging from the overarching story for characters we don't know or care about or are actively annoyed by just to have a meaningless conversation or practice swordfight is very bad.\\n\\n\r\nEven if the world building wasn't shoved in your face like a child showing off how much spaghetti they got on their hands, it would still be bad because the world itself isn't interesting. For all intents and purposes, the world that Overlord takes place in is a reskinned Middle Earth or generic D&D setting, just like a lot of fantasy stories, whether high fantasy, dark fantasy, or whathaveyou. As a result, we don't need to spend an exceptional amount of time exploring the world because looking at a map is enough for us to begin guessing the state of the world and who exists in it. Simply looking at the side-characters is enough for us to more or less understand what they're like going forward. And if that isn't enough, a few lines of dialogue makes it clear.\\n\\n\r\nCompare this to Swort Art Online. How that show does world building is by having the protagonist go on many unrelated adventures to various, interesting locations, meeting new friends and enemies along the way. We see the world, we hear the world, Kirito interacts with the world. We get enough of the world to feel like we know it without being inundating with information, while also implying that there's much more to the world than what we've seen. This is not the only way of doing world building, but it's vastly more effective than whatever Overlord is doing. I imagine it's trying to go for the Lord of the Rings approach, but you never read in the books or saw in the movies that one time when Jim and Pillock were standing on the walls of Minas Tirith before the armies of Minas Morgul showed up, talking about their pasts or explaining the hierarchy of their government to each other. To sum this up, what I'm saying is Sword Art Online does better world building than Overlord. To say that Sword Art Online does anything better than anything else is not a compliment.\\n\\n\r\nJust as a side-note, I don't know if it's just Japan or what, because I've seen this in other anime too: Nobody ever mentions the fact that a kingdom is a kingdom in real life unless it's because they're being formal. If a guy was a messenger in Medieval France and was going to travel across the border to Aragon, he wouldn't say that he's going to the Aragon Kingdom. He'd just say he's going to Aragon. The Re-Estize Kingdom, the Slane Theocracy, the token evil empire that I've already forgotten its name (Bahamut? Or is that Final Fantasy?) really should not have their form of government mentioned aside from when it's revealed what kind of government it is. Imagine if we went around saying that we took a vacation in the France Presidency, or the United States Representative Republic. It's just silly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 2\\n\\n\r\nThis season of Overlord misses the mark in every single major way, undermining what was good and making the whole thing an absolute slog to get through. To top this review off, I'll paraphrase something I once read on the subject of the main cast and action: I would rather watch Ainz (Momonga) sit at his desk and do his taxes for an entire episode than see characters we don't care about fighting in an epic battle. Because I don't care about those characters or that battle.",

            "content": "Why did they even bother? Perhaps that single question summarizes the second season of Overlord the best. Because, and I say this with the best intentions, this is one of the least interesting 2nd seasons of anything I've had displeasure of watching. I enjoyed the first season of Overlord quite a bit despite its numerous flaws, and large portion of that enjoyment came directly from the main cast. Expecting more of them, I dwell into the second season only to find out that the main cast has turned into background characters that do nothing. \r\nFirst portion of the season - which is an arc, Isuppose, about lizardmen or whatever - is tantamount to watching paint dry on the wall. Lizard characters are uninspired, drab, boring, and their circumstances are less than interesting. I couldn't be bothered to care, so I couldn't wait for it to be over with. It took way too long as it was, yet they still couldn't properly build up even a single character or a single plot thread. \\n\\n\r\nDespite that, however, my greatest gripe with the story is that it's confusing as hell. And I don't mean that it's confusing just for viewers, it's self-confusing, if that makes any sense. It has no direction to speak of. Transitioning from parallel storylines is atrocious. New characters are just thrown at the viewers non-stop without taking even a second to build up the already present characters properly. New plot threads are introduced without ever having resolved the already lingering one. The major plot point of the first season (who was it that controlled the vampire) is thrown into the background, and is mentioned once or twice when the creator decides to show us the main cast. Not only is it all over the place, but even what we get is just... boring. I don't care about the fucking bottom-feeder lizards. I don't care about do-goody princess trying to fix the Kingdom or something. I don't care about the shady organization pumping kids full of drugs and selling slaves. Why don't I care? Because I was given about 30 seconds to process that information and was expected to just go with it and care. \\n\\n\r\nStory is a disaster. I'm sure that, at least in LN, all these seemingly loose plot threads eventually tangle up and it all makes sense, but it's hard to care and truck through to get to that point. If, IF, these side-stories we're given were interesting, then perhaps I would give a dime about what's going on - but they're not. They're rushed, and we're given nothing except info dump after info dump. Characters are expositing to the point of insanity, and I can't be bothered to care anymore. \\n\\n\r\nNext up - art. Oh. Sweet. Jesus. Christ. I know that art wasn't a strong suite of the first season, but this is atrocious. First 7 episodes feel like they gathered a baker's dozen intern scrubs and told them 'do whatever you want, nobody cares'. 'Fights' - it hurts me to even call them that - last about 10 seconds, and they couldn't even bothered to properly animate even that. Stills. Stills everywhere. Uninspiring designs. Every bit of charm that the first season had when it comes to designs is lost. Then we have lizard sex. It can't be unseen! Well, I hope she got pregnant anyway. I'm a good guy. \\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I've given characters such a high score is because of the main cast. While seeing them on screen feels like finding a cute, naked girl in your bedroom who swears to be your servant until the end of days, they're still relatively interesting. Besides them, nothing. Void. Absolute fuckery of nothingness. Lizards? Nope. I can't remember a single name of 10 or so lizards that were named. The only name I actually do remember is that guy Climb. Because his name is Climb. Fucking Climb. \\n\\n\r\nBecause of the sheer quantity of the characters, quality is nowhere to be found. Personally, I haven't read a light novel, so I don't know how it is handled there. But, however it is handled, this isn't the way to go about it. Not an episode goes by without being introduced to yet another character. Oh, because Clementine's character from the first season was so interesting, we also got a look at her(his?) long-lost twin-sister. Yaaaaay....... \\n\\n\r\nI'll finish the season for the sake of finishing it, but unless quality suddenly rises by umpth degree, this won't be going past 5. Final conclusion? Colossal disappointment.",

            "content": "It is a bad sign if a show titled \u201cOverlord\u201c has no such character in it. Instead, the viewer is bored with secondary characters, who may or may not be relevant in the future. This low budget production has nothing going for it, even the one feature that defined Overlord among the oversaturated \u201cIsekai\u201d genre is lost in the second season. As far as I can tell part of the problem lies within the source material itself.\r\nVERDICT: 3 \u2013 Bad. \r\nSTORY: Like a skeleton \u2013 no meat and no soul. \r\nOpening gives a 1:1 ratio of Overlord\u2019s presence in his own show; focus is onsecondary characters from the world and Tomb of Nazarick. Due to almost entirely new cast a lot of screen time has to be spent on dry expositions and introductions, leaving dynamic storytelling or world building behind. Early episodes are a necessary info dump, just like political talk in fast forward mode between the princess and some nobles in ep 10, because the viewer knows nothing about society and ongoing political intrigues at this point. \\n\r\nThe lizard arc is a pointless uphill battle without any tension, due to immense power gap of the combatants. The capital arc is a convoluted mess with the quality of a B plot. At the end the viewer learns about scheming ongoing behind the scenes, and those events sound more exciting than the actual plot. If you intend to do a shift in perspective, fill it with purpose; doing it just for giggles won\u2019t improve the experience.\\n\r\nIt seems like this adaption is missing some inner monologues that define characters and their actions; at least in manga, while meeting Lulu, Ainz has an important thought process analyzing the situation and using his experience from the real world. Instead, we got an awkward and utterly pointless lizard snu snu scene.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Like maggots \u2013 bland, dispensable and there are too many of them.\\n\r\nOverlord already had a big cast and the second season expands it even further. Lizards in general behave like reskinned humans with a strong mating urge and your typical Alpha Lizard hero on the front: kind, brave and strong. Everyone else is a redshirt.\\n\r\nCapital arc utilizes many characters, and even after 10 minutes of thinking, I cannot write positive words about them, they are just so bland and one-dimensional. Brain, the bandit from the first season, is the only remotely interesting character, because after his encounter with Shalltear he develops a different worldview.\\n\r\nDid I mention there is no Overlord?\\n\\n\r\nARTWORK & ANIMATION: Like a zombie \u2013 slow, unimpressive and decaying over time.\\n\r\nWhile the first episode had some quality artwork, the show declined afterwards, reaching its low point in ep 8 missing any animation and plagued with off model characters as well as bland, colorless backgrounds. Ep 11 & 13 surprised with noteworthy action scenes, however, cannot redeem a whole season of mediocrity. \\n\r\nFurthermore, the none-existent budget can be seen in horrible CGI lizards and skeletons in the first arc. Wisely, Madhouse spent money on a much better show airing at the same time - Sora yori mo Tooi Basho. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Like a ghost \u2013 is there, but you do not notice its presence. \\n\r\nOP is forgettable, so is all of the background music. Voice actors also do a mediocre job, no one stands out positively, like Clementine did in the first season. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a competent \u201ctrapped in a video game world\u201d anime with a clear goal, superb world building, diplomacy, smart use of game mechanics and successful focus on NPCs, try Log Horizon.\\n",

            "content": "Just a little over two and a half years ago I talked about the series Overlord. It had some interesting ideas but was kind of mediocre. The second series came out early this year. Now, one thing I was very clear on when I reviewed te first was that it had potential. Rather like Made in Abyss, which I just reviewed. But, like that series, it wasn't there. So, let's see what we get in the second series to improve on things, if anything.\u00a0\r\nStory:\r\nWe open with our guard captain from the prior series, Gazef, discussing the great and powerful magic caster who saved him. No,it's not Trixie. We also see various other characters discussing their take on the current situation, just to remind everyone what's happening. Our series starts properly with a bunch of lizard people living their everyday lives. That's when they're greeted by what looks like a Legion Persona telling them they're all going to die. The Green Scale tribe acts quickly, sending an envoy to meet with the other tribes and unite them to deal with the threat.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nIt turns out the threat is Cocytus, commanding an army of low level undead, but forbidden from fighting himself. After that tale wraps up we move to Sebas who finds a\u00a0 battered, abused woman on the street. He decides to rescue her and unintentionally brings the wrath of a major criminal syndicate against him, possibly drawing attention to Nazarick.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with what I don't like about this series. First off, the lizard man bit ends rather abruptly and leaves a pretty major question unanswered. Now, I'm sure they're going to bring it back up in series III but it would have taken a couple minutes to give us some closure on that front and there's not really a reason to make it wait for another series. The second issue I have is one I'm a bit mixed on. There are points where ladies being attracted to Ainz borders on harem shit and it gets really cringey. However, his discomfort with that does lead to some of the funnier comic relief moments so I can't just outright hate it as an element.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nOne of my issues with the first series was that the Nazarick crew, Ainz in particular, are over-powered and it hurts any chance of tension. In this series, they address that by building the tension around other characters that they spend some time building up who are just normal people. The tension surrounding the Nazarick crew is more built around what they'll do to these other characters and whether or not they'll be revealed to the world. And that's a legitimately clever fix to that problem. So, full credit on that one.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe series is still good about introducing intriguing plot lines that they can go into more detail for later. They also resolve enough within the series to make it feel like it has a satisfying conclusion while also leaving plenty of room for more developments. Which would still be true if they'd taken a minute or two at the end to answer the question about the lizard men and I think that's a big part of the reason that particular oversight bugs me because the lizard man bit doesn't feel like it has an entirely satisfying conclusion whereas the other arc does.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nGradually, Overlord is doing more to develop its main cast. Sebas, Cocytus & Demiurge in particular. I actually rather like the way they tie the two of them to their creators and I like that Sebas was created by a dude who went by the moniker \"Touch Me.\" That's a great screen name. Overall, the series focuses\u00a0 more on developing the characters they're actually building tension around than the Nazarick crew though. Which is a real necessity given that we're supposed to be concerned about their fates. And if the series keeps giving different members of Nazarick the spotlight in different arcs all the major ones will be nicely fleshed out in series V.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI really like the character designs in this. There are a few additions in this series that I can appreciate in particular. The first is that the female lizard people don't have large bosoms in spite of all logic. And so many works just toss pronounced boobs on their lizard women just because people like boobs even though it makes no sense given how reptiles work. Most depictions of the Yuan-ti, the Cardassians, the Yinchorri, the Falleen. and many many others have gotten that wrong. So, well done on that front, Overlord. They also have Entoma, an insect woman who just looks really cool and she has a great power set. And I know she was in the first series briefly, but I don't recall seeing her true form in that one.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe acting is quite good in this one. Since there are characters who get a bit more development, there's more of an opportunity for their actors to shine. So, Chiba Shigeru, Katou Masayuki, Miyake Kenta, Osaka Ryota, Touchi Hiroki & Amamiya Sora get\u00a0 the chance to really do their business. And they all do it well. I didn't really like the theme tune much, but I did like the music in general.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\r\nThere really isn't any.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\r\nThis is a franchise that gets compared to Sword Art Online quite a bit because they both deal with people in a game world, although in this one he's glad to be there and this franchise also isn't bollocks so they're quite a bit different. And this instalment just further distances the two because it's legitimately good. It's\u00a0 not just a mundane series with potential that's only superior to SAO by virtue of not being rubbish, it addresses a lot of the issues that held the first series back and provides an entertaining viewing experience. It still has some issues but they're a lot more minor. Ultimately, I give it a solid 7/10. I actually look forward to reviewing the third series when it finishes airing and I can get round to it.\u00a0\\n",

Season 1 is what I would consider a show carried by its premise; it's execution was mediocre at best but it's base concept appealed to people and I can understand that. But *this*...\r\nAs much as I hate to be that guy, I really don't think all the people raving on about it with high reviews know what they are talking about, or haven't actually watched enough anime to know good from bad. The plot is a broken mess, with gaping  holes from last season completely ignored while several new side storiesare piled on top. The writing is awful, with bland dialogue and exposition dumps as far as the eye can see. And, perhaps its greatest sin, is that the majority of the season is devoted to an entirely new cast of characters that can only be described as the most generic and forgettable lineup I think I've ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of building on what the previous season established, Overlord inexplicably decided on quantity over quality and just screamed \"MORE!\" while it dumped everything it could on top of what little it had; more stories, more exposition, more characters, quality be damned. Overlord II is the epitome of superficial; if you were to simply remove the overlord branding this show would be drowning and forgotten in the sea of mediocrity as it deserves.",

            "content": "First, I think it's fairly important to note that both Overlord's second season is really more a continuation of season 1.  Much like with the Fate/Stay series.  This is made more apparent with the fact that Season 3 is set to aire with 26 episodes, rather than the 13 for both prior seasons.\r\nThe main reason I found this was because season 1 focused more on Albedo, Shalltear and Naberal, season 2 focuses on a completely different set of characters, being Cocytus, Demiurge and Sebas, along with some of the more minor characters from the background.  Even Ainz himself barely makes a showfor the majority of it.\\n\\n\r\nSo with that, on to the actual review:\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nWithout giving the actual plot points away...  The story for the first arc was a little on the dull side imo and as a standalone, I would rate it around a 5.  But the second one had a lot more going on and (sorry to say it...) Demiurge is a much more interesting character than Cocytus.  I would rate the second half at around a 9, so a combined score of 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI have loved the art style for the show since the first season, this is much the same.  The artwork is crisp and clear, the character designs are fantastic for the most part and the settings are handled very well.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe voice acting is very well done.  Nothing 'quite' so spine chilling as Clementine's rather infamous scene from season 1, but it cannot be faulted in any way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAinz, Sebas and Demiurge are all very interesting characters with some good development throughout the season.  Cocytus starts off ok, but then pretty much just drops off the radar, so it could have been handled better.\\n\\n\r\nOnly complaint is the lack of any characters you grew to like from the first season.  Almost no air time at all for Albedo or Shalltear.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nOverall, it's a very enjoyable show and can't be faulted there.  The storylines are worth a watch, the art is nice to see, the VA is above par and if you are a fan of either video game or high-fantasy genres, it's pretty much right up your alley!\\n\\n\r\nMore than all of the above, being only 26 episodes in its entirety so far, it's well worth a watch for the fact that it can be done in a couple of days alone.  Highly recommend!",

            "content": "It is a common belief that a sequel season can never match the thrill and lure of its predecessor, but Overlord 2 proves that statement wrong on many levels. \r\nThe story commences where the last season ended: the fate of Shaltear. By picking matters up where they were previously left, this season immediately demands your attention and interest in a most rewardable way. Throughout this season's story, we are introduced to a plethora of new, controversial characters - some unlikeable, some likeable. However, it seems as if these characters were drawn this way - as if the writers wanted us to feel like this forone way or another. For example, the lizard clans were strange and suspicious to watch since it is logical to want to see more adventure within Ains Ooal Gown. And while the story seemed to drag on and persist in conjuring up unknown characters, it ultimately becomes clear that they are intended to intertwine in the most satisfying way with the protagonists that we hold so dearly. \\n\\n\r\nTo lead this further, I cannot begin to comment on the adoration I bear for some of the characters. And thus, I feel a need to emphasize how carefully the creators have crafted Lord Ains since certain scenes - which entail internal monologues from the Undead king himself - in an attempt to highlight his transition from a human-like state to an immoral and power-hungry ruler. But it is this thin line between morality and immorality the writers create through some of the characters that hold us in place and keeps us wanting more and more Overlord. It is this craving we bear for them and their adventures that permits us to indulge in watching multiple episodes in one sitting. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, this season is not without its faults. As many fans will agree, there is a particular scene with two lizards that felt unnecessary and stupid, to say the least. And because a single scene cannot be held accountable for all the faults of a season, it is important to mention the lack of lore and backstory for some of the characters - who are they? where are they from? - that threw us into their individual stories and expected us to watch with acquiescing. This left me feeling slightly unsatisfied and desiring more...substance when it came to particular characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you are a fan of the 1st season then you will undoubtedly enjoy the follow-up (if you pay no attention to certain silly scenes and move onfrom them). I would recommend it for viewing if you have the time and committment for it. \\n",

And this Second Season the story getting more serious. But the Story it's feel like too fast not because the episode too short but the feel of story is feel to fast, well i didn't say it's a bad thing though. (8/10)\r\nArt : Same,there is no significant difference about this. (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nSound : Same again like the first season, just change the Opening and Ending song wich is  it's nice to hear. (7.5/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : Now the character, there is more a lot of character in the first season didn't tell us and now in this Second Season you will know it. And with interesting story.

            "content": "(My english is not very good, haven't read the light novels, I only typed what's on my mind and what i remember + spoilers) There are 2 types of cancer in the world of Overlord. First the fanboys of the light novel who thinks that this piece of shit is a masterpiece and second are the sao haters who compare every isekai to sao. These fags who compare Ainz to Kirito are just absurd. Ainz is someone who's already OP because he is OP. He put his blood, sweat, tears and probably money and with the help from his guild members to become OP. MeanwhileKirito summons an excalibur up his ass. How? Da hell should I know? This anime has harem to but it's not SAO level kind of harem. Now onto the review... I have never skipped any episode in season 1 because season 1 is so good, here I have skipped the crocodile recruitment program and I have seen fanboys who defended this arc saying you have no idea how deep and complex and political... man shut the hell up! You know instead of recruiting the lizards why not recruit another undead faction from this world? Wouldn't that be cool? Another undead leader proclaiming he's the lord of the undead from this world. It took inspiration from that 6 fingers vs sebas scene where the 1 finger proclaimed that he's the lord of the dead but what we get is Lizard sex and feeling sorry for these lizards being slaves. There is this episode and it's a cool episode where Ainz make a throne made of undead soldiers and right there he showcase his power to these Lizards and they already want to pledge to him and what did Ainz do? He rejected it so that we could go to more unnecessary battle between beetlejuice and icelizard. I thought they're just gonna beat the Lizards up but no they fucking killed them and bring them back to life and they pledge allegiance. I was like waaaaa? After everything that has happened they didn't even use these Lizards on the next arc. The screen writer was like fuck this lizards! Chekovs gun my friend! Chekovs GUN! The next arc wasn't terrible but the characters oh God! Climb and Tea Parties!? Climb, Princesses and Tea Parties? Sebas arc is good and the last 2 episodes are great. I want more of that last 2 episodes, it's the overlord that I watched in S1 where there's this sense of blood pumping adrenaline for being overpowered. That's overlord to me! Not these Lizards, not climb, not princesses, and definitely not tea parties!",

            "content": "This season was very fluctuating in terms of enjoyment. At first, It felt entirely as an OVA and not a second season. It's as if they had a big lump of OVAs so they decided to make a new season out of it. However, the last two episodes raised the bar a little bit and make the expectations for the third season quite high so with that I think it passes.\r\nStory\r\nAs I said, it was like an OVA. The first half of the season was about Ains taking over the Lizard villages which, for me at least, was quite prolonged. It didn't seem to servemuch purpose to the story in overall, but we'll see how that turns out in the third season. The second Arc focuses on Sebas against an underworld organization called the Six Arms. Again, rather than focusing on the overall progression of the story, it focused more on the gap of level between Nazarick's residents and the rest of the villains and heroes in the world. The reason I found this season to have some value to it are the last two episodes which finally add some progress to the story we left in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really hard not to describe the first 11 episodes as pointless as it stands right now. Maybe if you've read they'd have some value to them, but as it stands right now with no third season yet, they don't seem to serve any purpose.\\n\r\nThe first season was all about exploring the world and knowing the people who dwell it and potential dangerous enemies whom may pose a threat against Nazarick which is to be expected since that world differs greatly from the one Ains is used to. Here in the second season, instead of seeing something interesting that might add some thrill to the series, we're shown \\n\r\nAins playing the cool Overlord guy.\\n\r\nFoes who are basically one shot kills that there was no point in even naming them.\\n\r\nExtremely uninteresting combat. Even between characters who're close to each other in level, they just spend 15 minutes having a little intimidating chat and 5 shouting the names of their spells; giving the actual combat a few seconds of time.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this changes in the last two episodes which I'm not going to describe since that'd be like spoiling the entire season's worth. However, you can expect the story to pick up where it left from there.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nDidn't improve much over the first season which was indeed good in its art style. If anything, it held up to the last season's standard in art style which makes it somewhat nostalgic and original. The art is a major focus of this series and this season is a proof of that since Ains wouldn't have been able to showcase his abilities and dark aura without good art.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe first season had one of my favorite OSTs which makes it difficult to compare it to the generic OST of this season. It pales greatly in comparison to the first season that it's not even a competition. Yet, it wasn't bad in general if you don't hold that high of expectations out of it.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment\\n\r\nIn short, if you're longing for Ains' demagoguery then you won't be disappointed with this season as long as you don't mind the story being put to delay until the last two episodes. One thing I personally liked in this season is the use of more bloody deaths in comparison to the first season and I hope they do add even more in the future.\\n\r\nAs of the time this review has been written, the third season for Overlord has already been announced for July 2018. Though, this does emphasize my theory that this whole season was a bunch of OVAs they decided to show us to quench the thirst for a sequel. I can't deny I'm quite excited to see what the third season has to offer.",

            "content": "Just hear me out for those that hate reading reviews with differing opinions from me, and of those that truly enjoy this series, but mainly the novel. I actually find it to be quite hilarious that the top reviewer, aka RebelPanda, wrote one of the most ridiculous thing ever written, and probably one of the most invalid, fallacious, illogical, and even the dumbest arguments that I\u2019d seen in the long time, manages to get so many supporters despite how stupid his arguments are lmao. \r\nAnd all of that came from someone whose sense of taste in anime is so disparate from those who actually watchisekai animes, and other fucked up shit dealing with human morality, and philosophy dealing with dark subject matter: human depravity, rape, slaves, corruption, nobility, ideals etc. I\u2019m pretty sure he had only actually watched a few of these sort of series, since most of his favorite animes are more consisted of Yuri, and girly animes (like that one called Princess Tutu on his top 10), but with the only exception to \u201cMonster\u201d (a pretty good horror anime), and Higurashi. \\n\\n\r\nAnd everybody also knows that it\u2019s not virtually possible to turn the light novel\u2019s character designs, or art, into animation given the amount of work and the differences in the overall art that was meant to be drawn as a still image, rather than a moving piece of art; and he bitched about that\u2026 lmao.  He also said that, \u201cMomonga is Kirito\u201d, than later lead a bunch of premises that has nothing to do with that. I could say, Y is X. Then proceeds to say some other shit that doesn\u2019t support why Y is X, then all of the sudden segue to something else entirely while not talking about the first conclusive premise. He also uses examples that has less than 5 points that made sense, while leaving aside all of the 50+ differences that the MC has in comparison to Kirito. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, here\u2019s the thing. How is this anime anything like SAO, or the MC being anything similar to Kirito? His only line to support that was the MC is op, and that he\u2019s a harem protagonist ; although he gives no fuck about romance as his skeleton form kept his overall emotions in check, and literally everything about the anime\u2019s setting; the MC\u2019s personality; the MC controlling his army; the MC being an undead; the MC living in a world where he coexists with characters that he and many of his guild members had created; the MC being the leader of the guild but is not considered to be the strongest amongst all of the members; the MC being a spell master; the MC almost died by Shalltear; the MC being fine with killing a bunch of people indiscriminately (kids, male, and females) in ep 13, although with mercy just so he could keep his sanity while not breaking his character as an Undead King in front of his generals, basically, the MC kills both the innocents and the enemies, unlike Kirito; the MC borrowing the power of his comrades to help aid to defeat someone, unlike that Kirito dude who can solo everybody; the MC looking up to one of his savior, Touch Me, who is considered to be the strongest player in YGGDRASIL (the game\u2019s name) unlike Kirito; and I could go on and on here, so had he not seen the anime? \\n\\n\\n\r\nSo why was his review taken seriously when there was no insight as to why the anime was trash when all he did there was summarized the plot, and made a pretentious lines mimicking sophistry, pretending to make his overall points sound reasonable by using the unreasonable, then later call them bad and acted as if all of that made sense. Anybody could do that shit. I could summarized the plot of Made In Abyss, then call that anime a piece of garbage by finding one of the most dumbest anime to compare it to, with barely any connections to the anime but only like one or two, then all of the sudden you get likes for it. Are all people of this generation that naive and oblivious? \\n\\n\r\nAnd the common pattern that most of these illogical reviewers carry along with them is usually accompanied by the most unreasonable need to downgrade their artistic sense, musical sense, and appreciation for the externalities that had been incorporated into the anime (music, voice acting, art, and cinematography) for a special case just so they could make their overall \u201clow-rating\u201d of that anime looked seemly reasonable. Or rather, the more radical the review is, the more people would be interested in their reviews. \\n\\n\r\nPutting that aside, the anime has one of the worst exposition to starts off a second season to any series that I had seen. It felt like the creator was implying that we should read the light novel if we wanted to know how we hop from the last thing that we saw in season 1 to season 2. Like the fuck man? I watch animu because I dont have that much time to read a light novel lmao. Plus, the introductions to many of the new characters/groups seem to just appear out of nowhere, while lacking in great details and explanations in brevity, and without any decent transition to segue from one scene to their first appearances. And tbh, they all just died off really quickly. I mean, if they have some world item or something, or some sort of an enigma to them, it would\u2019ve made this eight finger, or whatever it was called, alot more interesting. Additionally, this season really do lack alot of challenges for Momonga. That\u2019s actually one of the many things that im kinda disappointed. The lizard Arc was a little bit boring imo, I mean, sure, it\u2019s their way to remind us that Momonga, the man seeking to take over the world, isn\u2019t all that nice. Generally, anyone with that sort of goal are never nice to begin with. The idea there looks nice, but it could\u2019ve done it in a more interesting way, with settings, characters, some third party involvement, etc. And not with the trite archetype. Even though im naming all of these cons that one of the top comment dude didn\u2019t even tackle upon, the animation, and art was actually pretty good, objectively speaking. I'm actually a bit surprised by the animation quality tbh lol, especially during the fight scene. The ost wasn\u2019t all that impressive for sure, and the voice acting is pretty good in and of itself, it\u2019s just that there aren\u2019t many unique characters with a weird manner of talking that would showcase some of the voice actors\u2019 talent in the anime. I mean take that one crazy girl who got hug to death by Momonga for instance. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this season appear to just be another introductory exposition to a much greater story in the future, coming in season 3. They maybe lack the budget to completely cover other groups who may served as the main antagonist, or at least an adversary that kinda rivals Momonga himself that exists in the story, but they sorta doing this in this episode. Although, they only did introduce like a couple of groups, but not the one that was introduced in season 1, and they\u2019re the more interesting ones too sadly, so it was sorta disappointing. But that being said, seeing sebas being a gentleman and being affected by his creator\u2019s ideal of justice, seeing the maids in action, seeing Evileye, some capable of at least fight and actually beats one of Momonga\u2019s maids, Momonga causing character growth to his own generals to think on their own as well and not just by obeying him like a puppet all the time (which incidentally led demiur to act on his own in ep 12 and 13, that benefitted Momonga greatly). All of which is pretty entertaining and fun to watch. \\n",

            "content": "Lately around MAL community , it's been a trend to give low ratings to every popular anime and absolutely ignoring what exactly is it that the show is trying to convey or present . It's just much easier to write a bad review about a particular show and criticize it to easily get people's appreciation . Hating popular things have always been fun .\r\nIf developers make an ecchi genre , we can't really look at it from a philosophical stand point or expect an amazing story line, world building , powerful character driven stories or amazing character development . \r\nA moe or ecchi anime isonly made for fans of that genre so we should remember that at every single point before passing on the hammer of our judgement in such matters .\\n\\n\r\nBack to the question at hand of Overlord 2, If i had read the reviews on MAL and not watched this show , i would have missed out on a good fun experience . Not an enlightening experience but a \"fun\" experience. Ask yourself this before your going to watch this show :\\n\r\nAre you looking for a show that is very philosophical or dramatic or historically accurate or slice of life  or plain deep in context ?? If your looking for something which has amazing story lines , amazing characters , variety , uniqueness , thrill etc . \\n\r\nYour  not going to find all of this in this show and much more . \\n\r\nThis show is not mature , it's not even trying to be mature or different . \\n\\n\r\nBut what Overlord 2 truly is  is just a cliched , Isekai , Overpowered protagonist, adventure  and Fun show . This show is what I would call an Escapism show . It's a perfect show to escape from the worries and stress of life to watch a funny and mostly entertaining show .\\n\r\nIf you love Momonga being a badass , love how weak everyone else is , if you basically don't care much about the story but just wish to see how Momonga takes over the world , your going to like this show . Not saying there is absolutely no story here , there is some but its not that prominent . Also the world building in this show is actually not that bad . The power struggle feels kind of lackluster . Most of guardians  and their own motivations , their bits of story feels fun . \\n\\n\r\nAlthough this anime tries to be different from Other Isekai and in some ways it is quite a lot different . Momonga as an example isn't really much of a Hero and he truly is trying to take over the world . \\n\\n\r\nAs some people compared this show to SAO , I would  say there is a lot of difference , Kirito  always tries to be a good guy but Momonga is debatable , He isn't exactly a good guy or a hero trying to save everything . Also SAO laid a ton of emphasis on Kirito while here , we hardly see Momonga in the show . The lizard arc was mostly Lizards and their politics and struggle . \\n\r\nIt's quite interesting watching this show giving emphasis to these side NPC characters over the main characters of the show as it was mainly during the first arc . \\n\r\nKirito is also a loner while Momonga was the head of the guild , Momonga is smarter , much smarter than Kirito . He has his own little kingdom . \\n\r\nIt's like watching huge OP people crushing ants although Momonga seems to lack any real reason to take over the world . \\n\r\nThis show basically focuses more  on side characters than main ones , very different from SAO or Re Zero . \\n\\n\r\nBelieve me, I've read over 50 different Isekai already , Overlord does set itself apart from the rest  in many ways but I really wish for more genuine fantasy than this Isekai Genre being forced down our throats . \\n\r\nI also found this show to genuinely more funny than plenty of other Isekais who try to be .\\n\\n\r\nOk , Onto others things , The animations is alright , It's give it a pass , it's not incredibly amazing like Fate/stay (Unlimited budget works) but it's quite nice . \\n\r\nI liked the opening  for the first season better but the ending is not bad here . \\n\r\nThe soundtrack , i hardly remember any real OST from the soundtrack so i am not the best person to judge this . \\n\r\nThe characters are decent and quite cliche , they are mostly your average anime tropes , some of them are getting a little character development like cocytus and Sebas Tian . Rest most of them either don't get enough screen time or are one dimensional . \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude , I enjoyed this anime despite it's flaws as when I watch Overlord , I am not expecting to watch Monster/Mushishi/Code Geass/natsume yuuchinjou etc . \\n\r\nJust looking for a nice fun anime for timepass  and that's exactly what this show offers . It's  better than many Isekai shows but some of the old shows  about being summoned to other world will give this this show a run for it's many . \\n\\n\r\nRatings : \\n\r\nStory : 6\\n\r\nArt : 7\\n\r\nSound : 7\\n\r\nCharacters : 5\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 8\\n\r\nOverall : .6.5  ( I'll give it a 6 for now , will see what to give after i finish the anime ) \\n\\n\r\nBut remember , don't worry about the reviews , If you liked season 1 , you will 100% like season 2 \\n",

This would be fine if it was season 1 but its not and season 1 did a much better job at it too. This creates a really slow paced show where the protagonist Ain doesn't seem to have any real role. This feels more like a filler season from your standard year long shonen anime. This is a huge detraction from the ending of season 1. Ending of season 1 had a really good plot twist and left the viewer with a lot questions. I am up to S2ep9, at this point there seems that there the show has no desire to answer any of the questions at the end of season 1.",

This anime centers on an intelligent protagonist/antagonist which holds together each character in the first season. This season, after you pass the annoying lizard episodes that no-one cares about, is far better than the first, because we finally see a chemistry between characters that othermediocre anime don't have. Couple that with an interesting premise and a widening world which this season gives us a look at (beginning with Shaltear's incident). \\n",

            "content": "Honestly, this is more of a 'in-between' part of the seasons and plot itself rather than the main story. Why? Because it focuses more on the supporting characters from before, who serve under Ainz's supremacy. I don't know why it is getting such low scores tho.\r\nFirstly, I actually enjoyed watching this. This second \"season\" of Overlord, is rather interesting. Getting to know Supreme One's subordinates and seeing the adventures of the 'unseen' people and beings is quite interesting. There isn't much to say, but watching it was hooking just waiting for the next episode when it was airing, and since it finished airing, I wouldrecommend you watching this just to kind-of find out the details and understand more about Sebas and the others, including some abilities of the NPCs themselves. I'm pretty sure this second season isn't really important towards the season 3, but you will most likely have gaps in knowledge if you skip this.\\n\\n\r\nArt is good as always, I really loved how this season was focused on fighting rather than political issues or didn't provide much fear of a new enemy coming up or such. It was more focused around humans and the interaction with them, especially on Sebas part. It felt as if all of the members from the Tomb of Nazarick were doing their job and trying to gather the information, and instead of it being clipped out as it always is while everything is focused on Ainz, we actually see all of the behind-the-scenes action! It's really amazing to be honest! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter, actually, was a whole different thing for me. Despite Sebas and the others being just beings that were created by the players and were put into boundaries to behave and act as the Supreme Beings wanted, it feels as they've grown in mind themselves, especially after what Ainz ordered them to change in their behavior.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this isn't your typical plot-focused season, but more of a introduction before the main story which is going to take place, most likely, in the s3, thus I recommend you watching this JUST for the SATISFACTION during the fights, and how interesting it is to see Ainz find out what's going on, how others behave and what they face. It is thrilling to see the next thing coming up and in fact, this is the first time I've actually weren't able to think or predict of what is going to happen next! Can't wait for the next season!",

            "content": "The funny thing about Overlord season 1 is that it didn't really do anything special or notably unique in its story, art or character design. It just worked out what other people wanted and executed to such a polished degree that it stood out among a sea of bog-standard shows. Kind of like the best of the mehs.\r\nNow, in season 2, we dare to extend beyond the bog-standard and instead brave into what COULD be considered world development by some but is what I would rather refer to as \"being a shitty tourist\" in a world that's showing off about as much of the actualworld as launch day Elder Scrolls Online did (which isn't that much at all). While it's rare for me to throw in such a criticism in my \"first impressions\" paragraph I must highlight that this is an issue that has its roots in every plot of dirt. Yes, unfortunately for us, this anime has 'one of THOSE' overarching issues that just keep on going until the very end like some kind of cheap joke... except it's not a joke... it's more of an engine failure... for cartoons.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory -\\n\\n\r\nThe story for this one can be cut up into two arcs, both of which do the 'game of thrones' thing where everything your watching simply seems like preparation for something greater. The one difference in structure between this anime and the single most popular western television program in creation is that GoT doesn't make itself seem like a prequel until about two seasons later, everything you see at the time feels like a current affair and you're glued to the screen like melted horse feet. Overlord 2, just for clarities sake, makes the mistake of not doing this. It feels like everything I'm watching is just in preparation for something greater. It doesn't help that any mention of the nemesis from season 1 and the characters from the first arc of season 2, simply aren't mentioned later on. Which I could understand for the mysterious buggers from season one but certainly not for the lizards, which just completely disappear, despite contradicting indications. Will we ever get a follow up to the Lizards? or the Attackers ? or the Slane Theocracy? Maybe... But not here and probably not next season, or the one after that if this pattern is to be followed accurately.\\n\\n\r\nDid I mention Lizards? Yeah... What the f*ck happened there guys? We spent an entire arc with a bunch of uninteresting lake dwellers with some of the most poorly executed and awkward sexual tension in history while our ACTUAL main characters are building an army and doing exactly what I came here to see... bad guy stuff. I don't give a sh*t about some random snake-outcast who's playing Blues Brothers with his whole \"let's get the clan back together\" crap, which by the way, we simply know will not work because, well, duh.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc revolves around a massive new cast of characters whose sole purpose is to be ignorant until they finally meet one of Ains' minions. That's it. While it's fun to see happen for the sheer \"look on his face\" reaction you can expect from basically everyone, it does get a bit tiring after a while, especially when its basically the only thing the climax of the arc has going for it.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I don't want to seem like I'm bashing the second arc too hard. It was certainly more interesting than the first arc despite the fact it was basically all staged and expected from the get-go. A few things also came out of nowhere which were certainly welcome to me and at some point I did kinda forget how overpowered some characters were and I actually became invested in the fights.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound -\\n\\n\r\nI've gone on for a good while so I'll summarise this section with the standard \"It was fun, colourful and good\" comments that I usually put in because I'm lazy.\\n\\n\r\nIn all seriousness though, I enjoyed the soundtrack about as much as the first season, which I enjoyed a lot. The art is colourful and varied, however, there were fewer opportunities for the artists to show off the big sprawling grasslands that you'd typically expect from a fantasy based world. In that sense, I suppose the one time the Lizard arc takes the cake is in the number of amazing set pieces that you can feast your eyes on. At the end of the day though, it's not enough to redeem the arc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter -\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the characters in this anime are relatively typical of any normal anime. The difference between this season and last season is the immediately recognisable lack of both Ains and Mononga, the most important, interesting and entertaining character(s) in the show. He is THE main character and he's absent for 85% of the time, why? WHY?\\n\\n\r\nAs I've mentioned before, the Lizards were the main characters in the first arc, and as you know, I f*cking hate that. Enough said.\\n\\n\r\nIn the second arc, however, there are some interesting characters who have some interesting interactions with the guardians which I can't really mention because it could be considered worthy spoiler territory. Just know that I didn't really mind spending a good percentage of screen time with these characters, contrary to the f*cking lizards (I really hate them)\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Conclusion - \\n\\n\r\nThis is a solid follow-on to season 1 however it doesn't really do more than make me anticipate season 3. Should you start watching it? or regret watching it? (if you already have). SIMPLE. Yes to the first, No to the second. This is in no way a deal breaker for the Overlord franchise, it's just not a big boost that'll send it to the top of the charts. But... at the end of the day, did we really expect that?",

Thats probably why the writers chose to do this, this is why the characters are doing that *yada yada yada yammer yammer yammer* 9/10\"\r\nTLDR: Basically this season mainly centers around building up the world Ainz has found himself in, and the plans hehas made rather than him making them. It also expands on some things that were touched upon in the previous season, and simultaneously acts as a springboard for future seasons to come.\\n\\n\r\nI only have one major gripe about it, and that is: This would have been much better as a 24 episode season than a 13 episode season. I rarely beg for a season to be over 14 episodes, but this one could have really used it. However, with the next season supposedly coming out sometime in July, the wait for the next season isnt too bad. \\n\\n\r\nMy one minor gripe: This series needs some sort of calendar on it. While watching it the second time, i had the sneaking suspicion that multiple scenes were playing out at the same time, but at different locations.

            "content": "Overlord II for some reason doesn't quite have the spice that it carried so well for it's first season. It ends up feeling very oh another Isekai game anime instead of Overlord. \r\nPart of this reason might be because that the most successful approach from the first season was a very tight knit, and focused storyline around Momonga. And then he was established as a character who had really defining moments we could chuckle to. Season 2 tries to expand perspectives based on many characters but we end up with the Lizardmen, Sebastian, and the various Kingdom people. \r\nTo an extent it is a reallygreat attempt at expanding the world building but it's done so haphazardly that when it's forced to come together all in the end you don't really, truly understand the big picture or any of these characters and their motivations. Nothing clicks as an a-ha for the watcher and the narratives are forced together. And overall, devoid of emotion. \\n\\n\r\nAs great as Madhouse is with their animation quality, they too have fallen to using appalling CGI... However they still keep a good amount of well done high tension scenes that sadly don't go anywhere story wise. Sound was also quite unmemorable, even the OP and ED. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, as the story kind of falls through on cohesively pulling the anime together, the potential for some genuine character developments is hard to present. We actually did get an expanded cast of many interesting personalities, but as far as knowing enough about them, probably only light novel readers will know. Also the fact that the first and last snippets of Overlord II featured some really amazing character designs that have no connotation for anything contributes nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThe takeaway is that it ends up being another pretty, easy to digest and throwaway project. One that you can still enjoy as a generic action pack adventure story that continues to dominate the anime trends.\\n",

Overlord is the best Evil MC Isekai their is out there. It actually focuses on the whole world and builds many characters from outside Nazarick.\r\nIts great that it doesn't always follow the MC. The new world has shown how weak and fragile it has become yet it has taken down many strong players in the past that were revered as gods.\r\nEven the lizardman arc which is heavily criticized is extremely important. A whole species is fighting for survival against Nazaricks weakestarmy that just RANDOMLY generates around the Tomb. Ainz wanted to develop Cocytus as a commander. Adamantite warriors are known as living legends of the human world but they become fodderized by middle tier characters in Nazarick.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 3 is starting a little slow but to the light novel readers know whats coming. Listen to the dialogue and ask yourself why is this important to show you. The reason is it will build up a lot of action scenes later. The world props the overlord up even higher then 100% MC pov like most Isekai.\\n\\n\r\nI am happy to elaborate into more detail about Overlord but I don't want to spoil everything. Theirs a lot more occuring then you think like Demiurge farming Humans for skin to make scrolls.",

            "content": "I will attempt to keep this review as short and to the point as MyAnimeList allows.  \r\nSeason 2 (especially the first half of the season) was considerably less enjoyable than the original season of Overlord.  One of the major issues with this season was terrible sense of pacing.  Each half of the season feels like it should have been expanded into their own seasons (though, given how unenjoyable the first half was... maybe it could have just been excluded).  The creators crammed too much into this season and did not properly develop ANY of it.  This left all the charactersthat didn't exist in the first season to be very forgettable (which is bad since there is VERY little focus on the previously established characters... which are the protagonists of the story... or are they antagonists?  I dunno).  \\n\\n\r\nIn summary, if you haven't watched this anime yet, you can easily skip the first 5 episodes of the season (and may be happier if you do) and not miss out on any important information.  And be prepared for they creators putting the pacing at ludicrous speed and leaving it there the full season.  This is still an enjoyable anime (or half of it is), just don't expect anything ground-breaking.\\n",

            "content": "So, I thought a good way to organize my thoughts is to say what season 2 did better than season 1 coupled with where it was lacking in comparison.\r\nWhat went better: The fights and tensions are a lot more \"real\" than the first season. We know that most of the main guild are nigh invincible with the exception of World Class Items. Yet, the series focuses on the manipulation and battles of less powerful empires and races for the gain of the guild. This allows us to become invested in these new characters and gives a real \"Game of Thrones\" vibe to anyone outside ofthe guild. Past this, the character development of the guild when shown is going even farther. While loyalties are not crushed, you get to see how these once NPC backstory characters are now trying to \"advance\" and \"improve.\" It touches on ideas of them living up to expectations, still trying to become better either as people or as weapons. Finally, this show was able to match up to the \"smash kill\" of Clementine the previous season with some of the work Sebas was doing in his bid for side quests. Overall, it was a good season of Overlord that did well introducing a new and extensive cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhere it needs some work: Many have been claiming you can't write \"there wasn't enough action\" because it's not that kind of series. I completely agree, but I think those who say it are actually missing something more prevalent in Season 1. In this Season we see more of the subcommander planning and machinations of Ains rather than Ains himself. I understand why they took this route, however, Ains' character is so compelling that it leaves plenty of scenes wanting when he's not in them. The previous season we had more of his alter ego, Momon, to enjoy on screen. However, this season we only see him in the final few episodes essentially. The main issue was that less of his screentime meant less of the interactions I enjoyed in the first season. He bounces off his subordinates so well that even the times we saw them in this first season they stole the show for me. Unfortunately this drug the season down from \"very good\" to \"good\" for me, yet I don't think they made these decisions without merit. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly with the announcement for Overlord III this summer, I believe (yet without a shred of proof) that Overlord II was probably a two tour season of 24-26 episodes that was split in half. It seems like much of this season is buildup for a payoff we haven't seen yet. I also think this is where people are getting the \"disjointed\" feeling for the season; it's most likely loose plot point threads that haven't quite been tied back in. Regardless of what I think of this season on its own, I am excited for the continuation of Mr. Bones adventures. This summer will hopefully bring more of him and his gang to the forefront to shake up the world and establish his empire.",

Maybe they read the manga, maybe they connected the dots themselves by some mystical work of wonders. I could not do it (well, I have some hypothesis of course but... it's just a shot in the dark). And that is why, despite the pleasing aesthetics and the AMAZING premises, I find this show utterly dreadful.\r\nTo me, a person who never read the whole manga, this show is just a series of scenes showingthe same characters in different situations without any meaning to it. I spent 90% of the time wondering \"Why are they doing that???\". Nothing is ever explained or even hinted at. While the show has PLENTY of dialogues, I mean, a lot! All of them either are praises for our Lord the Great One, or a series of pathetic exchanges of pleasantries. In the end, I stared at the screen thinking \"So what?\": everything they \"build\" across all the episodes is never used.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character does not have a clue about anything and all other characters are mono-dimensional and boring. Some even incoherent with themselves, failing to even be mono thematic. Some are barely introduced and then killed or dismisses without much ceremony. Especially in the first arc... which I assume should have been sort of heart-felt by fan? Well, it gave nothing to me. Lord Ainz also gives explicitly contradicting orders to his subordinate for this fight. I cannot tell in detail without spoilering what happens so I won't, but you will understand when you see it.\\n\\n\r\nBattles are more hinted than actually fought. They dismiss opponents with a couple of quick blows and that's it. I'd rather have had less battles with a deeper strategy than a plethora of insignificant skirmishes that are mostly outrageously one-sided.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the only one single show that - among all anime I watched in the past years - most blatantly failed in telling its own story.",

Originally, this was more an observation rather than an outright bad thing. But as I progressed through the episodes, it became more and more apparent how lacking the show was in substance. Every scene and every episode always feels like it's missing something, which they ironically are. \r\nAs mentioned inmy TL;DR: It gets your attention, but doesn't do anything meaningful once it does.\\n\\n\r\nThe show generally looks nice, save some atrocious CG monsters. Though drawn well, most of the human characters are poorly designed and look very bland, especially in comparison to the non-humans within the Tomb of Nazarick.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n== Story: 8 ==\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Overlord is basically seeing how the Tomb of Nazarick interacts with the inhabitants of this world in various ways, plus overpowered butt-kicking. Overlord II continues in this fashion.\\n\\n\r\nThe core of Overlord's story is fantastic by itself, and though the anime doesn't tell it in a very satisfactory way, it's evident that there is a strong source material serving as the show's foundation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n== Characters: 5.5 ==\\n\\n\r\nOverlord does a strangely good job at getting us invested in the various people in the world. I've been genuinely scared for them when they inevitably come face to face against Ainz or his subordinates.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately like many other things in the anime, not enough quality time is spent to properly cement these characters in the show, or our mind. You occasionally get some highlight moments with some people, but those are far and few in between.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n== Enjoyment: 6 ==\\n\\n\r\nI greatly enjoyed S1 and the start of S2. But as I became more conscious of the show's shortcomings, that feeling deteriorated into exasperation. At the very least, the anime is good at pulling me into its world, and that was something that stayed for the whole season. I just wish it gave me something worthwhile for that investment.",

            "content": "I don't know how to really feel about this. While watching this i noticed a massive dive in quality.\r\nThis is now my 3rd rewrite that i'v done of this. I wasn't happy with how i described my first review. Then i also felt that my 2nd review wasn't up to par with what i wanted. \r\nThis is now my 6th review of the winter season shows. I don't think that this is even in the top 5 of the shows for this season. Maybe around in 6 place.\r\nThe first story arc of this season could easily be mistaken for a completely different show altogether. I'mnot even kidding but i for a second thought i had clicked on the wrong show at some point and had been watching something Completely different then Overlord for the past 3 or 4 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nI came out of that Story arc feeling like it was completely pointless. It seemed more like someone with a fetish for lizards somehow got their fanfiction put into this. Nothing of interest happens and finally when the big battle is about to happen. It's over in less then a couple minutes. Very boring and Anticlimactic for me.\\n\\n\r\nWe do have a story arc that i like a lot. The arc involves one of my favorite characters \" Sebas \" and him taking care of a former slave girl tossed out into the streets to die. I am a sucker for these arcs with these girls slowly being brought into a respectable life after dealing with bad stuff. \\n\\n\r\nI do wish that we just got a spin off series where it was about Sebas out in the country away from lots of civilization and he finds a  little girl at a young age left to die on the side of the road. He then ends up taking her in and raising her. Hell, It doesn't even need to to be in the universe of Overlord. Just someone with the personality and power of Sebas.\\n\\n\r\nI do feel that the story arc was hampered by the show adding in two characters. \"Climb\" & \" Brains Uglus \" I find both of them to be worthless additions to the story and i despise \"Climb\". \\n\\n\r\n\"Climb\" is just an awful character. He's more like what you expect to see out of those 3rd rate shows where the males are transported to another world. He is not fun on screen and the amount that the show tries to shove him down are throat. I don't care about him. I more care about the slave that Sebas cared but the show doesn't seem to care. He also has a dumb name.\\n\\n\r\n\"Brains Uglus\" i think he is alright. But he isn't anything special. He's kind of bland . My honest opinion is that he feels like the creator realized last minute that they needed an additional character so he went and looked at the past season and found some random character that was more like a throwaway character. \\n\\n\r\nThe other biggest issue i have is the plot line of the Royal Family. We had this character that seemed interesting and nice. She was the only person that wasn't a fighter and actually seemed interesting. Then the show decided she needed to be a bland antagonist ? I don't even know if she is meant to be a future villain or if she is just a fucked up good guy. She's turned into a cliche villain. The rest of the family isn't any better. Worst thing of it all is that the Princess ( The chick i'v been talking about ) Is overly obsessed with fucking \"Climb\" of all characters.\\n\\n\r\nSomething the show also seems to have forgotten is that Ainz ( The MC ) Used to be a Human. The show seems to have lost interest with the MC learning why he was suddenly brought into another world as his game character. I feel this is a fairly big plot hole in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nThis show also has a weird obsession with blondes this season. If you don't count any of the villains. Then i think just about every new character is Blonde for whatever reason. \\n\\n\r\nWe get the introduction of a adventure group of characters. At first i don't like them. Especially the big weird old lady that is always wanting to sleep with people. But besides her, I started liking this group of people. The Leader,The Twins and the the Evileye character are pretty entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nThe Leader looks nice and has a good character design. She has little in the way of talking though so it's hard to get to know her personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe Twins are nice looking and they are just one of the more badass characters of the group.\\n\\n\r\nThe EvilEye is my favorite. I do wish the show didn't have her hyped up to be such a powerful person but in the end she's just weak. I like how she's i guess hasn't had her heart beat in centuries but when Ainz saves her she get's all giddy even though she is meant to be the serious and the straight man. \\n\\n\r\nI kind of feel these characters are wasted in this. I would love a show that wasn't part of the Overlord universe and was this group of people doing their own thing. \\n\\n\r\nI'v also noticed that the girls in this tend to be better then the guys, The Maids are all awesome and i love them. All of them have special characters. I loved that we got the Bug lady to actually fought. I wish we got more of the Maids fighting.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite guys are \\n\\n\r\nSebas: Awesome powerful badass old looking dude. That has one of the better personalities. Easily better then Ainz\\n\\n\r\nDemiurge : I think he's badass. Honestly he has a certain feel around him that Ainz, A character that is meant to be menacing is lacking. I wish he was more rebellious. Like he doesn't want to work for Ainz but does it out of a sense of pride. Honestly him and Sebas better characters then Ainz or even any other character.\\n\\n\r\nFinally. The art seems to have taken a dip. Still good but i notice a ton more issues then last season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a drop from what we got last season. I still don't get what's so exciting about htis show and why it has so much praise.\\n\\n\r\n This story i'v noticed has a ton of good idea's that seem wasted on this one show.",

While there were many Laughs tied to Sebas and Unglas, the show once again fell flat in the fact that we didn't learn much in terms of the world or progress that far along the primary story.\r\nThe shows strengths includes the characters and the humor with its weakness being its choice of episode allotment and plotline. \r\nThe first arc was interesting, but felt dullas it disappeared just as quickly as it came, and many new introduced characters only got a glimpse in the spotlight. well Demiurge and Sebas finally showed some color, the remaining cast was forgotten for side characters of the kingdom. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I grant Overlord S2 a 7. It was enjoyable with moments of humor, some fun action, and some wild characters but doesn't compete with many other action adventure shows plot wise. I think its a fun watch, but this likely won't be your next favorite.",

            "content": "I can see the light novel being worthwhile, but the adaptation lacks in many aspects, namely pacing, action, script, character interaction... Jesus, they can't even do fanservice properly, more than half of Albedo's screentime consists of her static images in the ED. Pretty much the same goes for Ainz and the OP.\r\nI should be talking about the story now, but... I don't know, it's a clusterfuck.\r\nWe basically have 2 halves, first one is about a questionably motivated genocide carried out by the main cast, mostly from the POV of the victims and focused on Cocytus. Not the most enjoyable narrative, but executed quite well. Ihave no idea how is the outcome relevant to the story in long-term, but I will give it the benefit of the doubt, at least there was an outcome... on the other hand...\\n\r\nThe second half is about... about what, exactly? Royal intrigues? Underground crime? A simple boy unknowingly haunted by a yandere genius? Ainz doing his undercover stuff? Sebas getting game by being a badass? Demiurge being a fuckboi in all of that? Evileye being cute?...\\n\r\nWell, whatever it is, the pacing of the second half is all over the place. It's dragged-out, then suddenly rushed, then dragged-out even more and then again rushed to the finish. What's even worse, nothing from what I've mentioned comes to any kind of conclusion. Ainz gains some prestige, Sebas gets the kitten. Wow. That's literally it.\\n\\n\r\nNot sure what I'm thinking about the general consensus that Madhouse releases tend to be polished and beautiful... I guess the animation is okay-ish, but nothing worthy of special praise.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is totally plain, I didn't ever notice music playing during the scenes. Nothing amazing in the VA department, either, they are all being overly melodramatic as always. OP is meh, ED is quite memorable on the other hand.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are the redeeming quality of this series. Almost every single character introduced and developed in both halves of this season is to some degree likeable and/or interesting. Except for Climb (the aforementioned simple boy), that guy's only ability is to steal screentime from relevant NPCs. Considering that the show's success is heavily reliant on fanservice, the lack of Albedo and Shalltear sucks major balls, even though they are substituted by various cutiepies in their absence. Shame that we don't see much character development, too.\\n\\n\r\nEven though this anime is average at best as a whole, I wasn't bored at all while watching it, didn't skip a scene. That's some alien shit. I guess the fanservice was done properly afterall.\\n\r\nHowever, I feel like they went for \"low effort, high profit\" kind of production, that's why I'm giving it a below average score. The source material does deserve better.\\n\\n\r\nStory 3/10\\n\r\nArt 5/10\\n\r\nSound 2/10\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nFinal 4/10",

            "content": "Well. Bad news. They had a good thing going, but they blew it and flushed it down the toilet. As a result we have a very flawed anime - with VERY well done moments, overshadowed by VERY badly done moments.\r\nNow, good news first. The anime has multiple arcs, and the FIRST one is amazingly well done. I was sitting at the edge of my seat, and I was surprised by it. The arc is 8/10 material, easily, and if ONLY the rest of the anime was as good as this arc....\r\nUnfortunatley, past the first arc (which goes for 5 or 6 episodes), the qulity goesto hell, and they start prolonging. Episode after episode characters do as little as possible, are animated as little as possible, and every episode ends with a cliffhanger. Heck, they even start fighting as if it was a shounen anime - with speeches and all. The \"faulty arc\", unfortunately takes bigger portion of the anime, and its quality is so low compared to beginning so I've been wondering if the studio blew too much money at one of those huge battle scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe  good and noticeable thing about the anime is that it excels in a few moments where it displays ainz's companions as what they are - meaning monsters and demons. There are few scenes, where they managed to portray them in truly chilling way, where you couldn't help but feel respect the power of those creatures and their inhuman behavior. But. There aren't a lot of those scenes - the number is tiny, and they appear very rarely, with total combined time of all those scenes under 10 minutes at best. IT is really unfortunate. \\n\\n\r\nDetails.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, the story for the first arc is 8/10, but the rest of the anime brings the score down due to being prolonged, relying on cliffhangers, etc.\\n\\n\r\nThey did the right thing by dropping the \"game-like world\" aspect and concentrating on the world itself, also the show feels significantly darker on occasions, now.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nIT is okay. I think it is a slight improvement compared to the first season of the Overlord, but it is not very high. The notable thing is taht they have MASSIVE battle scenes on a few occasions, but those scenes utilize CG, and it is quite obvious that it is CG.\\n\\n\r\nIn the second arc, they seem to be cutting animation cost, because there are battles that happen off-screen. Meaning yo uwait several episode till the central figure of the arc gets to show what they're capable of and.... you don't see the scene. Instead of showing an awesome fight, the anime shows something else.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10:\\n\r\nOpening scene is catchy, and menacing tune that plays in a few of the \"monster scenes\" is quite chilling.Music is good, but it doesn't take the spotlight.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10:\\n\\n\r\nWell... same deal as before. There are incredibly (7/10 material) believable, well written /side/ characters in the first arc, which are so well done, that you can't help but feel sympathetic to them. However, once the arc is over, those characters are gone, and they're replaced by some sort of awkward automations with confusing motivations. Most of the characters in the second part aren't convincing at all, with exceptions of a very few. Heck, it is bad to the point where one of the most convincing characters (Nabe) has something like 5 lines total in the whole anime.\\n\\n\r\nSigh.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10:\\n\\n\r\nI loved the first arc, but endless cliffhangers and poor pacing of the second arc seriously ticked me off, and killed the fun for me.  So for the most part I wasn't enjoying it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe good parts of the anime are episodes 1-6 and second half of the episode 11. If you skip the rest you'll lose very little, next to nothing.\\n\\n\r\nI can recommend watching the first arc, but I should warn you that if you expect the same quality for the rest of the anime, you'll be incredibly disappointing. Further arcs fail to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nSo, proceed with caution, at your own risk.",

            "content": "Ok, so this is my first review, so I'll just go over all the points and such.\r\nThe story is a mess for me. There are way to many separate stories going on at once for me to stay interested in all of them. In the first few episodes we see the main story of the main character from the first overlord, a story involving an old lady and a dragon, a story with a general, a story of the kingdom's princess and royal guard, a story of lizard men, and a story of the MC's butler in town, which is just too much for meto be interested. There might actually be more and I forgot. I'm sure these stories are meant to meet as one giant story at the end of the show, but with only 13 episodes, I feel it'll just be rushed. I'd say there are only 2 or 3 pairs of stories that have met and become one story so far, and it's already half way through the season! It's not that any one story is bad, but we don't have enough time in 13, 22 minute episodes to be invested in all of them, which is why I give the story a 4.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is nothing special as far as I can tell. Nothing to write home about, but I can't say it's awful. Get another generic isekai show and paste one of the characters into a frame of Overlord and I bet they'd fit right in. This one's a 6.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, is also nothing special. The voice acting seems very typical to me for anime, which means girls are very high pitched and I forget how all of the characters sound after 5 minutes. 6.\\n\\n\r\nJust like story, there are too many characters. We already know of all the floor guardians that MC has, but now add on 4 times as many characters and you have Overlord II. The guardians were already enough for me, if not too much, so this is ridiculous. Do they want us to remember every single character they introduce? Like I said in story, we can't be invested in all of them, especially in 13 episodes, so this one's also a 4.\\n\\n\r\nI don't particularly enjoy the show, but I do enjoy finding problems with shows, which is why I've watched 6 episodes of it. The only big problems of this anime that can keep someone from enjoying it are that there are too many stories to be focused on, and it being so generic. We've been brought into another world far too many times and the genre should be dying by now. The spin for Overlord was that the MC was brought into another world, from another world within a video game, but that was the intro of the series in the first season. Now it's just a fantasy anime  with too many characters and an MC who is knows about Japan. This is a 5.\\n\\n\r\nSo, that's it. Another generic Isekai anime, except it has 5 stories. In total, it gets a 5.\\n\\n\r\nUpdate-Episode 7-Spoilers: \\n\r\nEpisode 7 was unbelievably stale for me. We see this sword fight between general guy and determined knight for no reason other than to fight. We've barely seen this knight, so the anime goes and says that this would be the perfect time to dump this exposition on you, hurray. Then, he goes back indoors and sees the obvious villain, who talks smack about the princess, whom knight probably loves, doing all these great things for the kingdom, but he doesn't say why it's a bad thing for him. Yeah, the princess is helping the poor, but why are you against that? It might be medieval-ish times, but that makes little sense. Ok, now that's over, and we see knight, princess, and other princess like person along with another guard like person talk for 5 minutes about something be barely know about, because that's the definition of entertaining. \\n\r\nNow, we are brought to the mansion with Old butler, Maid, and Slave. Men come in saying that taking slaves from their owner is illegal, so Maid says to MC that Old butler is a traitor. What? Why? \\n\r\nNow we are more than half way through the season and still, we haven't seen more of the dragon and old women story, or the wimpy master swordsman story. Plus, what ever happened to MC's plan to spread his name to find more players trapped in that world? Instead of focusing in on this unresolved issue, the anime has given us 5 more issues to worry about. Who's that asshole who hates the poor? What was the princess talking about? Who is the dragon? what will master swordsman do now? What will Butler do now about the slave? What will the lizard men do, now that they're under Nazarick rule? Why was it important to know that knight was an orphan? Why does everyone who isn't a \"good guy\" immediately start acting like an unnecessary villain?\\n",

The anime spends multiple _episodes_ building up stories around characters that are then confronted by Ains and subsequently discarded, without going back to them.\r\nThis is very, very, annoying. When the show spends 30 seconds to introduce characters only for them to be slain instantly. It's not a good way to build up suspense.\r\nThe pacing is also atrocious at times, spending the majority of an episode just talking and explaining unnecessary details.\r\nThe art is alright, not a fan of the CGI, sound is meh, characters are unique and fun butfeel lacking.\\n\\n\r\nBut, I did enjoy it. The power fantasy is quite fun, seeing how Ains has to balance his power, image, and prepare for external threats. If you liked Overlord 1, you may spend some time watching this just to get some more lore, but I do suggest perhaps speeding up playing speed during the entire-episode-talks. Very boring stuff.",

            "content": "Overall, I think this was a decent season but I was a bit disappointed. If you really enjoyed the first season give this a try but know that it is pretty slow. \r\nThe reason I liked the the series so much is because of Momonga/Ainz Ooal Gown/Momon. He is a well written character and his motives are understandable. His actions make sense based on his motives. He doesn't do good things because they are good and he doesn't do bad things because they are bad. Their is reason and thought behind his actions which is the strength of the character. The Show's Art and Musicdoes a great job of showcasing how powerful he is and how weak his opponents are. \\n\\n\r\nHe is still very much the same in the second season, the problem is that he seems like a side character for 8 episodes. During the first and second arc of the show if I asked you who the main character was, if you didn't watch the first season, you wouldn't know it was Ainz. The best part of the show is a side act for more than half the season. The main characters of first two arcs are one-dimensional boring characters. I understand that shows with extremely powerful characters need supporting characters to show how strong the main character is. This doesn't mean they have to be boring. In One Punch Man this character is Genos but in OPM the plot still revolves around Saitama. They would have done better if they shortened the first and second arc and focused on Ainz. The final arc felt a bit rushed with sides stories tied up in 30 second clips played next to the credits. They could have expanded these but instead it felt like they didn't want to invest the resources in making a full length season and just tried to compress everything into the final episodes. I hope they get more funding next season because the first season was great and the final episodes showed they are still capable.",

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\n\u2726Story\r\nTo sum it up this season is about building relationship, world and presence of overlord and his adventurer persona. For the most part I think it was fairly well made and quite interesting, but at the same time I felt like lot of things were simply made to make you dislike members of \"Great Tomb of Nazarick\" and the leader himself. As this reason really shows a lot of his quite immoral acts for fairly prudent and villainous reasons in the long run. As well this seasondid show quite few extremely grim moments of which some characters were in. Nevertheless I couldn't particularly enjoy this season as much as the whole setup of the story felt quite uncomfortable. As whole, it's good, but for my personal taste it felt too selfish and \"evil\" for me to able enjoy the story of this season. \\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art & Sound\\n\r\nAnimation and art was good as always. Great magic presentation and overall character designs were quite nice.\\n\\n\r\nAs for sound, I found some OST quite amazing. Whilst other music I didn't particularly notice or care about.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\r\nA lot more characters were introduced. Sadface to Tuare. Anyhow, fairly interesting characters. Mainly the servants that were introduced. Then we also have some fairly \"very good\" characters and few of those that wear a catface. Meaning that characters that are seemingly \"good\", but in fact they are one hell of a twisted minds. Long story short, did enjoy for the most part all of the characters for the role they take part of.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nLong story short. I found this season more uncomfortable and in a way it somewhat made me lower the score. I usually like dark and twisted things, but this one somehow didn't get the praise from me. I just hope overlord will over the time became more of a \"good savior\" than \"evil ruler\". As whole I find this franchise unique and interesting, but I felt this season generally being a bit weaker plus I did enjoy it a little tad bit less than the first season.\\n",

All the characters return and there are some great arcs for characters who previously did not get enough screen time. Unfortunately, I feel that Madhouse seriously dropped the ball on this one. I know that the studio has undergone a lot of turnover in previous years but this was the first show from them where I really noticed it. The art, timing, animation and sound design just felt sloppy compared to the first season. If you were clamoring to see a return of Overlord I would haveto recommend the light novels which I recently finished. They go a whole lot further in the story and really flesh out the characters a lot more.",

            "content": "Let's start at the beginning.\r\nOverlord S1 was a decent success of a show in my opinion. The stage was set with systems for how the world and specifically the main character Momonga and his magic works, many diverse and interesting characters and an unknown world, with the \"goal\" being quite vague apart from safeguarding and expanding the base, nazarick.\r\nThe ending few episodes of S1 hints at what will continue in s2, but what greets us is...\r\nNow let's start with Season 2.\r\nWe have all that knowledge and expectations of what kind of story to expect from the first season, but we are instead greeted into thetale of the lizardmen.\\n\r\nIt's like a complete separate story not heavily tied to the world of Overlord, where the main character isn't even directly involved. The characters are dull and the end can be seen from a mile away. The objective with the arc is pretty unclear to the entirety of the story, but it can be summarized as the incentive being experimentation from the MC.\\n\r\nFor some reason the artstyle of the lizards, especially the colors and sharp lines are horrible and look pretty cheap, which is a major part of why I disliked the first part of this season.\\n\r\nThe second part of the season is what I would like to call \"the real start\" of the second season, due to how it lines up nicely with the ending of season 1.\\n\r\nI only have one major gripe with this part, and that is the character \"Climb\".\\n\r\nClimb is a character who really doesn't fit in - This specific type of character is a mix between a \"pathetic MC\" and a \"tryhard guy of the class\" kind of character, in the sense that he always loses, always tries the hardest but will never be good. Normally this type of character is the MC himself, and is seen in comedy shows. It really does not fit in here, and the story could have done well without him. Another notable feature about Climb is his voice, especially the tone of his voice - it's unbelievably annoying.\\n\r\nApart from this, the second part of the season delivers to a degree what you would expect from having watched season 1, apart from the fact that the main character is still mostly absent. \\n\\n\r\nAnother major flaw present throughout the season is how stale the dialogue is. There is no fluidity in speech and characters basically take chess-like turns in speaking. The villain introduction in the end of ep 9 is something that low-quality shounen anime/manga does. It's really awkward to have the \"big villain\" (who will be present for a mazimum of 4 episodes) do the introduction of all the villain characters and on top of that call them out one by one and name their full titles in a monologue only for the sake of introducing them.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know where exactly to put this at -  The first half is irrelevant, a pointless character with a lot of focus in the second half and the MC is MIA for 9 full episodes save for a few quick glances.\\n\r\nFrom what i've written so far this would seem like a bad show to watch, which is not entirely true. Overlord II is just a bit out of place in terms of the story, and does not live up to the first season. Overall I rate this as a 6, with some minor potential for growth as we are still in mid-arc. \\n",

The art is basically the same as S1, and is well animated.  However, there are parts which are pretty obvious, low to middle quality CGI. \r\nCharacters are a little more interesting than in S1, but fail to fully flesh themselves out.  Lizardman arc ends too quickly, and there's not really a reasonfor the demon arc.  The arc could have been condensed into two episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nIt's a power fantasy that fails to create meaningful power.  If S3 takes the many, many loose threads from S2 then that will be a hit, but S2 on its own fails to deliver.",
