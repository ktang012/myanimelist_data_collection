            "content": "*Minor spoilers ahead*\r\nThere are a lot of things that can be said about Sword Art Online, and most of those things are not pleasant. I will not mince words: I am no fan of the series. The first season was filled with so many issues, both significant and minor, that even watching a single episode was an incredible test of patience. There were some neat ideas hidden in between the mountains of nonsense, and while I can understand why the show was so enjoyable to so many people, in my case, it was like an aneurysm waiting to happen. \r\nThere is often a dichotomy ofopinions towards the show. There are the fans who adore the characters and setting and staunchly defend their right to enjoy whatever they please, and then there are the critics who despise everything the series stands for, often going to the extreme of attacking the fanbase and treating the series like it is an abomination forged in the fiery pits of hell. And that is precisely why, regardless of which side you stood on, Sword Art Online was likely not the kind of series that could be given a shrug and promptly forgotten. \\n\\n\r\n\"Was\". The same cannot be said for the second season of Sword Art Online. Whereas the first season was either the song of angels or the cacophony of demons, the second season is the essence of mediocrity. It delivers even more of the virtual reality-MMORPG setting and Kirito's usual 'time to save the day and wink at my bitches' attitude, but that's really all it is: 'more'. It's not offensively bad like the first season was (though it does come close at times), nor does it deliver anything to keep the fans particularly excited. It is a sequel that exists to be a sequel. It exists because the author created a successful franchise and thus he needed to keep the fans appeased by throwing more Kirito and Asuna their way. The story could and should have ended after the first arc, but profits seem to speak more than artistic expression. So it goes. \\n\\n\r\nTo have a discussion about Sword Art Online is to discuss its flaws. There is almost an endless supply of issues to complain about, and while I will not be able to mention all of them (lest this review reach novella length), I also do not believe that enjoyment alone is enough reason to praise an anime. So you will have to forgive me for nitpicking the show to death. The little things do add up after a while. Death by a thousand cuts, they say. \\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online's lacklustre second offering begins with the initially promising (and quickly disappointing) Gun Gale Online, or GGO arc. After the events of the first season, Kirito is tasked with investigating the murder of several people within GGO, because... well, apparently a teenager is more capable than the police or a federal agent who has actually been trained in investigation. He is also forced by his contractor to play in the game as a female avatar, because reasons. If that is supposed to be a method to help conceal his identity, it certainly does not have any effect when he continues to refer to himself as \"Kirito\". Most likely, the author simply put this in so that the fans might be able to write yuri doujins and fulfil their secret desire to be the little girl. That's cool either way, but it doesn't do much to establish the series as something that can be taken even remotely seriously. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of his female avatar, Kirito is seemingly the only guy in the entire game who plays as the opposite sex. You would think that pretty normal (it's common enough that people often have to question the real-world gender of female avatars), but every single guy in the game believes without a shred of doubt that Kirito is actually a girl. And so they hit on him and fawn over him. Sinon even goes into a full-blown rage when she finds out about Kirito's actual gender, stating how she feels betrayed and how Kirito was a liar for not telling her in the first place. Like... okay? I guess the author felt it necessary to turn Kirito into a heroine himself because there somehow wasn't enough fanservice already, what with all the frequent shots that stare directly at Sinon's butt. \\n\\n\r\nKirito being Kirito, he immediately makes a name for himself by winning a near-impossible minigame with little to no effort. And while, sure, it isn't too strange that someone would immediately get the feel for an MMORPG, it is certainly a problem when his playstyle is utterly contrary to the nature of the game. GGO is not a game about melee combat; it is about guns, grenades and positioning. If a player decides to pull a knife twenty feet away from someone with a machine gun, they will be absolutely and utterly destroyed. Or at least that would be common sense, if sense actually applied to Kirito. He decides to use a lightsaber (yes, seriously) in a first-person shooter and then proceeds to dodge or cut every single bullet that ever crosses his path, and in one case, even sends a bullet flying into a building which then causes the entire thing to collapse (apparently he deflected a tank shell). Perhaps Kirito is some sort of god, seeing as he can think and react thousands of times faster than any other human being. The show explains it away with some 'high agility stats' nonsense, failing to realise that Kirito predicting the path of dozens of bullets two feet in front of him requires superhuman thought just as it requires superhuman speed. It seems Kirito is so powerful that petty concepts such as sense do not apply to him. Praise be to our God, Kirito. May he forever bless us.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, the addition of Sinon creates a bit of a distraction from the Kirito bollocks, but her being a female character, she still inevitably becomes a part of Kirito's harem. And he manages to swoon her by spouting some of the most embarrassingly clich\u00e9 lines I've perhaps ever seen in an anime. Let me quote one of his brilliant lines: \"No one dies alone. When that person dies, the part of them that lives within someone else dies too. You already live within me!\" And yes, this is actually something he says within the show. Now excuse me while I go and vomit. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also one particularly obnoxious scene in the second episode where Sinon, falling from the top of a skyscraper, somehow dodges all but one of the hundreds of bullets hurling at her from the gattling gun below. All of them land just a few feet below her, which one would assume is because the shooter is trying to match his aim with her falling speed, except if he wasn't completely lacking in brain cells, he would realise that all he needs to do is stop moving his aim for a fraction of a second and Sinon would be annihilated. No such thing happens, and Sinon sends a sniper bullet through his head as she approaches the ground (because that is how sniper rifles work), spouts a cheesy catchphrase (\"The end!\") and lands with one of those clich\u00e9 shots where where her back faces her dying enemy. I'm not sure if this was scene was supposed to be 'cool' or something, because the only emotions it conveyed to me were frustration and embarrassment-- embarrassment over the fact that I just finished watching something that even 10-year-olds would think dumb.  \\n\\n\r\nSinon's trauma is somewhat interesting, for it at least creates a character in the show who is actually flawed as a person. But the manner in which this trauma is developed is far from great. She's portrayed as being emotionally strong, even more so than Asuna or Our God Kirito, and then as soon as she sees the same pistol that was used in the incident from her trauma, she immediately turns into a suicidal mess, saying how she doesn't care about dying while actively making an attempt to survive. Whatever. The trauma is not there to develop Sinon's character in any meaningful way or to carry any message about the struggles of post-traumatic stress disorder, but simply exists to establish her as a tragic heroine so that the audience can pity her and empathise with Kirito's desire to protect her. How exciting.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also tries to create a trauma for Kirito too, although it only ever comes across as a lame, cloying attempt to make him a darker character. He is apparently haunted by his SAO days where he was forced, in self-defense, to kill two player characters who were murderers themselves. He is so damaged by the incident that in one scene, a nurse actually hugs and comforts him, but his supposed trauma is never explored in any depth and is forgotten about as quickly as it is mentioned. The fact that he can laugh, smile and engage in PvP only moments later is a testament to the fact that it never really mattered in the first place. It also shows that the author has no idea what kind of character he even wants Kirito to be: is he a dark anti-hero or a light-hearted goof who just happens to be good at MMORPGs? The show has no idea. It throws Kirito from personality to personality, to the point where you have no idea who the hell he even is any more. \\n\\n\r\nThe story surrounding the antagonist of GGO (cheesily named \"Death Gun\") deserves a small amount of praise for its willingness to change the show's formula a little bit by creating a meaningful connection between the virtual world and the real world. The way in which Death Gun carries out his crimes is actually quite neat, but the identity of the killer is perhaps less so. The killer immediately transforms into a raging lunatic the second their identity is revealed, committing their crimes for reasons as dumb as \"I hate my parents\". Is it so difficult to write an antagonist that actually has personality and a legitimate (though disagreeable) reason for their actions? It's not as though every person who ever commits a bad deed is a psychopath. Normal people do bad things, too. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the suspense of Death Gun's murder spree is created through dumb contrivances, though. The characters cannot log out in the middle of the tournament, meaning it is impossible to avoid being killed by Death Gun unless they defeat him in the game themselves. I am pretty sure it would be against every sort of law imaginable, especially after the SAO incident, for players to not be able to leave the game whenever they please. What if there's something urgent going on in the real world and they can't get to it because the tournament is taking longer than expected? What if their bloody house is on fire? This restriction is utterly asinine and would never actually exist, but I suppose there wouldn't be much story if it didn't. Sword Art Online is less interested in creating a believable world and more in twisting and changing everything about it to fit with the author's whims. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of GGO is over before it ever really starts. It's a shame, because the setting actually carried a surprising amount of potential. The post-apocalyptic, mercenary-led and cyberpunk wasteland of GGO is far more exciting than the tired 'fairies and elves and swords' fantasy of SAO and ALO. Once the fight with Death Gun is wrapped up, Kirito and his harem simply move on to the next game without much care. \\n\\n\r\nExcept the 'next game' is just ALO all over again. The second arc of the story is a forgettable haze of nothing. All that happens during these three episodes is that Kirito obtains the most powerful sword in the game, because he wasn't already powerful enough, or something? There's also more utter stupidity like Kirito and his party being pulled into a questline that can actually delete the entire game's data. I am absolutely sure the developers would program something that allows years of hard work and their entire source of revenue to be brought to nothing. Right. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the next game is more ALO, too, although the story does attempt to take a different turn in the third (and final) arc by temporarily passing the protagonist baton to Asuna. But even a lack of Kirito seemingly cannot do much to improve the series. Even with the incredible amount of detail given to Asuna's character-- her troubled relationship with her mother who wants her to lead a normal life, her feelings about the future and her struggle to save a newfound friend-- somehow, after all those episodes and all those awful things she had to deal with, Asuna was still the exact same person she was during her first appearance. She does nothing but fill the shoes of what many would consider the 'perfect girlfriend'. She is lacking in flaws and devoid of personality. She's just a pretty face who goes through some bad things. I suppose the aim shouldn't even have been to develop her character, but to give her a character in the first place. If you throw a rock into a tornado, it will still remain a rock once it reaches the ground. \\n\\n\r\nAmong the dozens of other things in the third arc to find issue with, there is one particular scene that comes to mind. As Asuna and her new friends are fighting to reach the boss room before another group of people, Kirito somehow, conveniently, shows up as a part of their reinforcements. He decides to betray them all for Asuna and her friends' sake, and holds off the twenty or so people completely on his own. The initial half of the enemy party decides to use healers, and one of Asuna's allies then complains that they're \"not being fair\", as if using healing magic in an MMORPG is somehow a new concept. They manage to win despite being vastly outnumbered, and as Asuna and her party enter the boss room, Kirito, surrounded by flames, makes a peace sign while holding off the horde of enemy players. Somehow I think this scene might feel more appropriate in a teenager's fanfiction. \\n\\n\r\nIt should also be mentioned how cringe-worthy any scene with Yui is, such as when Kirito writes a program so that she can 'see' through the cafe's camera and then hang out with them in reality. Please. She's an annoying NPC, not the daughter of a bloody teenager. If she were to be erased from the entire story I doubt anyone would complain. \\n\\n\r\nAnd why are Kirito and Asuna so incapable of showing physical affection? They've been dating for three years now and even made virtual babies with each other in SAO, but in the real world they do not dare kiss or engage in sexual activities. It makes their relationship feel very weak, superficial-- almost like the author is afraid of fully committing them to one another because it would make Kirito unable to have his harem. The show eliminates any sense of a realistic romantic relationship by attempting to appease both harem and Asuna fans, except in reality, it has quite the opposite effect. Those who want to see the relationship between Kirito and Asuna developed will only find themselves disappointed, and those who want more of the harem will find themselves even more disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with Kirito's harem is that all its members are there only as eye candy. Even Kirito's bouncy sister is pushed to the side and made irrelevant, despite her receiving so much screentime in the previous season that it seemed things were about to develop into a love triangle. Nope. All that was for nothing. She and the others all still follow Kirito along, finding themselves jealous whenever he and Asuna share a tender moment, and really, what is the point in them even being there at this point? To remind us they exist so that they can used in ero-doujins? Great. \\n\\n\r\nFurthering this issue is the show's reluctance to write in male characters that are not raging lunatics or utterly irrelevant. Kirito is the only male in the entire story who ever matters. None of the girls have any interest in Klein or any of the other males; they just fight over Kirito despite the fact that he is already (supposedly) in a relationship. It's not that there needed to be another male character with his own love interests, given that Sword Art Online is absolutely terrible at writing romance, but the least the show could do is give Klein and the others a bit more attention. Klein exists only as some random dude that tags along with Kirito, and it's a shame, because he's a hell of a lot more interesting than Kirito ever was. \\n\\n\r\nThe last few episodes carry a fair share of emotional weight, but it's quite difficult to care much about what's going on when the entire arc moves at lightning speed. Asuna and Yuuki act like they're best friends after only knowing each other for about two days, and it's not much longer until Asuna starts rushing to her side in the real-world and crying for her sake. Sure, it's pretty hard not to feel sorry for Yuuki given how crappy her situation is, but the audience is just thrown into the drama without being given any time to think about what's going on. I'm not the kind of person who believes there is something inherently wrong with shock value, but I mean, for god's sake, the least you could do is give me some reason to be invested in the characters first. It's just melodrama without purpose. \\n\\n\r\nThe actual fight scenes are also thoroughly disappointing. There are no longer any situations where the characters' lives feel at stake. It's a video game and Kirito is incapable of defeat. Most of these are barely longer than two minutes, anyway, so if you were looking forward to massive boss battles and crazy nonsense from the first season like Kirito's dual-wielding skill, there is none of that here. The show instead spends most of its budget on Sinon's ass. \\n\\n\r\nDoes Sword Art Online look nice? Sure. And it sounds nice, too. But no matter how pretty the scenery and how intense the main battle theme is, it cannot make the unexciting exciting. Unless the music is married with an appropriate scene, it will achieve nothing if not being awkward, and often the scenes in Sword Art Online feel awkward. All Sword Art Online does is look and sound nice-- in this case, the wrapping paper is more exciting than the contents. \\n\\n\r\nThe show has some issues. \\n\\n\r\nI still feel there's so much I've missed and so much more that needs to be said about the series. I've tried my best to assort all my angry groans and rolled eyes into something that actually resembles a proper piece of writing, so if it feels like a massive wall of whining, I apologise. There was a lot to whine about.\\n\\n\r\nAnd no, I don't believe that my standards being \"too high\" is a valid rebuttal. Standards are not something that anyone should ever apologise for. It does not matter if a show strives to be some intellectual commentary or if it's content just being simple-ass entertainment (and Sword Art Online definitely falls on the \"simple-ass entertainment\" side of the spectrum). If a show is dumb enough that you can enjoy it only by turning your brain off, then it is not something that is worth your time. There is plenty of entertainment out there that can be enjoyed while the brain cells are in use. Some of them are even aimed at children (see: Aikatsu, Cardcaptor Sakura or My Neighbour Totoro), so I don't see much reason to force yourself to enjoy mediocrity when quality is easily available. \\n\\n\r\nBut if you enjoy Sword Art Online, that's OK too. You're free to watch and enjoy whatever the hell you damn well please, and the people who say you are a lesser person for enjoying mindless entertainment are just as mindless themselves. Sword Art Online definitely has a great deal of appeal among younger folk and MMORPG fans, but please, if you enjoyed the series in any capacity, do yourself a favour and do not conflate your personal enjoyment with critical quality. Fun does not necessarily mean good. It often does-- how can we appreciate something we hate watching, after all?-- but in this case, the enjoyability of Sword Art Online has nothing to do with its merit as a story. Because it doesn't have any.\\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online is a mess and it needs some shovelling.",

            "content": "Before I start this review, let's all take this moment to bow our heads and close our eyes as we pray to the great and almighty Jesus-kun.\r\nOh Jesus-kun, let your humble servants be like thee oh Lord. Let us become OP, plot armored, self insert chick magnets so that we can build our own harem. Bless the harem oh Lord, that it be deemed worthy of your hax abilities, AMEN!\r\nStory: 2/10\r\n     You know how you can tell if a story is retarded? When the only way it can continue is if your main character makes an extremely illogical decision, that anyonewith common sense would normally refuse. \"Escaped a game where you almost died and suffered psychological scars as a result? Well why not jump into another one :D !\" ...The show has yet to get pass episode 1 and has already proven that a room full of monkeys could write a better script. But I won't completely kick SAO II in the balls, as they didn't repeat the crazy timeskips like before. \\n\r\n     You know what you don't do with a 24 episode run? try to squeeze in 3 disjointed arcs into one. You thought the move from Sword Art to Alfheim in season 1 felt left field?  Well the transition from Gun Gale to Alfheim takes the cake.\\n\r\nThe mini mission arc in the middle isn't even worth mentioning, since the whole purpose was to simply make Jesus-kun more hax than he already was by giving him the legendary sword Excalibur (sorry Saber).\\n\r\nThen there's the final arc.. Which was a melodramatic story  for the sake of getting the fans to cry a river.  \"Video games help make AIDS suck less\".. now try saying that out loud without facepalming yourself into a coma.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAs much as the SAO franchise make me grit my teeth,  it should go without saying that they have great production value. This was no exception as they made a visual spectacle that is pleasing to the eyes. The vibrant color of the game world will keep even a person with ADD attentive. The cinematics are also top notch, as the fighting sequence will have you creaming your pants. \\n\r\nHowever I can't say the same for the character designs. If you take a still shot you'll realize every character shares the same face, which is beyond lazy... But hey, I guess God really did make everyone in his own image.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nTo add to the visuals, we're also given a score to match the mood. Each scene is matched with a musical theme that works in unison. The OP & ED are even good stand alone listens. The voice actors were also fine, but no stand outs come to mind. They did what was needed to carry the show, and that to the least deserves credit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters from Jesus-kun's harem don't even receive any roles other than being the sideline cheer squad for our MC. Even Klein, who started out promising in season 1, is degraded to comedic relief. The main antagonist from GGO, Darth Vade-... I mean Death Gun was, believe it or not, a good idea for this series. Through him they tried to give Jesus-kun an internal conflict via post traumatic stress disorder. They also tried this with Jesus-kun's new harem addition Shino.. Now notice how I said \"TRIED\" as nothing really changed after the following arc was over. Kirito remained the plot convenient God and Shino simply fell in line as another conquered piece of ass by our savior.  The last character worth mentioning was Yuuki, who only survived the Harem God's clutches by succumbing to AIDs. Introduced in episode 19, we're only given 5 episodes to give a fuck... This is a text book example of forced drama, making Yuuki's existence to be nothing more than a token sympathy character, rather than an actual person. The only good thing to come out of this cast was Asuna, who finally got more screen time. Despite her \"development\" being brought on by forced drama it was better than having Jesus-kun bask in the limelight. Which in turn made SAO II slightly more tolerable than the season 1 trainwreck. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite its 5 page MLA format filled with problems, I enjoyed SAO II for what it was. They tried to develop a few of its characters. They tried to improve the shit story of season 1. And they tried to shine light on someone other than Jesus-kun. Although they failed in spectacular fashion, it was still fun watching it do so. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nSAO II excels in the audiovisual department but once again repeated its past mistake of having borderline retarded characters and story. For those seeking to give SAO redemption with this continuation don't hold your breath as it still remains in cesspool quality territory. However If you're a fan of this series and have yet to watch it then by all means give it a go, as it does improve some flaws that were apparent with season 1.",

            "content": "Mod edit: Review my contain spoilers.\r\n-------------------\r\n*Sigh... What am I doing with my life? Seriously: What do I have to gain by bashing this show? I\u2019m certainly not the first one to rip this anime and its inane hype train a new one and I definitely won\u2019t be the last. Therefore, forcing myself to sit through yet another collection of incompetent pacing, plot points that make no sense what so ever, and an unbearable self-insertion protagonist doesn\u2019t really seem to be worthwhile, does it? And yet here we are. Goddamn it\u2026 Ladies and gentleman: It\u2019s fucking back\r\nSynopsis: After restoring VRMMORPGs to their previous glory by beingthe total badass he is, Kazuto Kirigaya is approached by a detective who wants his help investigating the \u201cDeath Gun\u201d incident. This incident is a recent event in which a mysterious user who goes by the SUPER original name of \u201cDeath Gun\u201d somehow managed to kill another user in real life by merely shooting him in the VRMMORPG \u201cGun Gale Online\u201d. Kirito agrees, enters the game, is instantly amazing at it (shockingly), meets a sniper girl named Sinon, and enters a big tournament with the hopes of facing off against the mysterious \u201cDeath Gun\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nNow, that plot summary probably makes the reader raise a few questions, such as: \u201cWhy is the police department recruiting a random highschooler with a documented history of VRMMORPG-caused psychological trauma?\u201d, \u201cWhy does Kirito, the man who almost lost his life and witnessed others lose their lives in a video game, doubt so harshly the possibility of death through amusphere?\u201d, or \u201cWhy God? Why is there a second season of SAO?\u201d Well, unsurprisingly, none of those questions will be answered. However, that shaky premise is only the modest start to a slew of other problems that this show truly suffers from, and most of them are even worse than the first season.\\n\\n\r\nArguably the biggest flaw of the show is that the pacing is PAINFULLY slow. I\u2019m not exaggerating; each episode covers about two sentences worth of plot. For a show that\u2019s supposed to be centered around action, it is astoundingly boring this time around. It wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable for the first four episodes to be condensed into one; then we would be talking. Unfortunately, the show never addresses this issue and smacks us across the face with filler as it drags itself out for as long as possible. It's unwatchable at times.\\n\\n\r\nAnother major issue is the fact that the plot no longer has any suspense and provides no reason for the viewer to care about what is happening. In SAO\u2019s first arc, we at least had a reason to care about what was happening inside the video game because it was life or death; the stakes were high and lives were on the line. In THIS season, however, the only driving force for us to care about the virtual world no longer exists outside of spurts of laughably forced melodrama. As evidenced by episode 2, the show tries to be theatrical/dramatic in order to convince the audience that what is happening in the game is REALLY important when it so obviously is not. I kid you not; there is a scene in this episode where a full-grown man almost has a mental breakdown because his PH (player hunter) clan was losing a fight. \u2026DUDE. IT\u2019S A FUCKING GAME. We are forced to listen to Sinon (more on her later) give us a ridiculous, obnoxious speech about how logging out and giving up on the battle is \u201cdishonorable\u201d, AS SHE IS KILLING AND LOOTING INNOCENT PLAYERS. Yeah, real sense of \u201chonor\u201d you got there. This might have worked in the first season when the stakes were legitimately high, but when the setting of your story changes drastically, you must adjust the content accordingly! I mean, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m surprised that this show doesn\u2019t make any fucking sense what so ever, but I still have to point it out. Overall, this is just an unbearably stupid plot, as per usual. Impossible to take seriously.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters\u2026 well... what can I say that hasn\u2019t already been said about Kirito? He is made only to pander to male-power fantasies. He is amazing at everything he does, he gets all the girls, and he has no flaws what so ever, etc. Basically, you wish you were Kirito. He is made for the purposes of self-insertion, and while people who know anything about storytelling recognize that this is a SHIT way to write characters, Kirito has been instrumental to the show\u2019s popularity. I HATE that this is the kind of character that becomes popular nowadays, but that\u2019s part of the reason I am writing this review; if enough people don\u2019t complain, it will continue to happen. Don't even get me started on the laughable ways that they try to get the audience to sympathize with him. The only other major characters this season are Sinon and Asuna. Let's start with Sinon, who is another completely worthless, helpless female for Kirito to add to his harem. The show tries to characterize her by describing her devout fear of guns, and I mean DEVOUT. This girl is apparently so scared of guns that she vomits all over herself just by glancing at a FAKE gun (\u2018cause that\u2019s totally believable\u2026). Now, you may be asking yourself, \u201cHow can someone who is so irrationally scared of guns be a top player in a super-realistic VRMMORPG that is obviously multiple steps above the intensity of holding a toy gun in your hands?\u201d Well reader, shut up. This is SAO. Never question it again. \u2026In all seriousness though, her entire backstory is just completely laughable because it doesn\u2019t make any sense at all. One of the worst portrayals of PTSD I\u2019ve ever seen in media. Any personality traits she may have been given eventually fade away into the same old harem-girl bullshit at the first sight of Kirito. Valiant effort, A-1, at least you are trying harder, but this character still sucks. As for Asuna, you already know the drill. A misogynistic object for Kirito to impress and presumably bang. She has an arc dedicated all to herself this season, and it's the cheesiest thing I've ever seen in my entire life. It's like SAO learned to write dialogue entirely through trashy romance novels. Very, very cringey. I won't say anything to spoil the villain of the first arc, but oh my god, if you are in need of a laugh, this show's midseason finale is a must watch. I was literally crying from laughter. That's how stupid SAO's villains are. Maybe worse than season one's.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion\u2026 It\u2019s fucking SAO. If you liked the first season and were able to somehow overlook its ludicrous amount of flaws, then you will probably like season two as well. If you actually have standards, recognized how incredibly overrated the first season was, and hated it, you will also hate this season. To be fair though, the show is still well animated and the music is still great. I\u2019m also willing to admit that SAO has a certain charm to it that shines through despite its major problems, which is probably the reason it has gotten so popular. Do I recommend this anime? No, not unless you are a young teenaged male, but it\u2019s not the worst I\u2019ve seen.",

            "content": "It came, almost like if it has been created for one purpose: polarize the public opinion, and yet the same scenario from back then take place, to be or not to be.... mediocre? I guess the answer was already given in that first season, I'll just throw it here, if we're watching this sequel we already know what to expect, there won't be a glorious comeback, we're watching the wrong franchise otherwise, SAO II is the same old SAO after all.. and for those who understand this basic concept, it might be entertaining somehow, I won't hide that fact, just make sure to leave thecommon sense and critic spirit in the next room before you close the door, that it's.\\n\\n\r\nSAO II inherited everything from it's predecessor, specially the bad traits that characterized the first season, traits that were a lot more in highlights this time since we had already experienced them, we live for the second time those faults that made infamous the first season, we could almost say it's practically a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Such traits are numerous, we could generalize and call the amount of the bad traits: The SAO Formula, a pattern of events presented since Aincrad, proposed again in Fairy Dance, and finally in this last installment, Phantom Bullet. Being able to determinate such pattern is not something difficult, we could summarize and say: \"Kirito came, Kirito saw, Kirito conquered\", but since this is a review let's analyze a bit better this concept.\\n\\n\r\nPhantom Bullet takes place a year and half later the SAO incident, Kirito, now living the normal high school life, is approached again by Seijiro Kikuoka, some guy from the Government, who informs him that a series of mysterious murders were happening, where?, obviously inside another Virtual Game. After the previous fantasy themed arcs, this time we have a characterized cyberpunk environment, a huge breath of fresh air, which provides in the only campus SAO distinguish itself, whiteout failing miserably, the Setting (I'll talk about this later). Gun Gale Online, the virtual reality game where a mysterious avatar called Death Gun seems to have the power to \"kill\" the players inside the game. After a remarkable phrase by our protagonist: \"There's no way that someone can be killed inside a game!\", almost like if his memories from the SAO incident were erased, he decides to find the culprit by entering this new world, Kirito goes to investigate!.\\n\\n\r\nThis is when The SAO Formula emerge completely, in correspondence like the previous arcs, Kirito is assisted by a new female character, in a new game, in a game where you could die in the real world, with an overly pathetic character as villain (Yup, a complete new environment!), but leaving aside those utterly obvious facts, the thing I disliked the most was the absence of simple Logic. If in the first season were remarkable deus ex machinas and bad developed scenes, in SAO II we have the complete absence of logic reasoning. \\n\\n\r\n(Now I'll write some phrases with the interrogation point just to emphasize better my point of view)\\n\\n\r\nLeaving Kirito completely alone during the investigation phase?, Laughing Coffin members that should have been arrested for murder after the SAO incident?, a guarantee security for those, possible, Death Gun's targets by placing some cops inside their house?... no? what about tracing somehow the IP?... for god's sake we're already in a future where Virtual Reality exist and the police can't really trace a player inside a game? and their only savior is a 17 years old kid?, c'mon!.\\n\\n\r\nThis season is characterized by Stupidity itself, there are no words able to justify the overly idiotic events occurred, because if there were for the previous season, this time there aren't. And we have yet to talk about how ended Phantom Bullet, the cherry in this cake!, the climax... but that would be spoiler so I won't, I'll just say instead: \"ASADA-SAN, ASADA-SAN, ASADA-SAN!!!\", you'll understand later and when you reach that part, drop a laugh in my honor.\\n\\n\r\nIn a similar mode as the previous arcs, the plot focuses only on Kirito and the new girl (The SAO Formula in action again!), ASSada Shino, while leaving aside the others characters that were once important in the previous arcs, reducing their screen time to only a few scenes. That means we don't get any Asuna or Suguha, already side characters, or how I like to say: \"They became part of Kirito's party\", and once they join it, the characters loses their personality completely becoming a side character, part of Kirito's harem. Unlike the previous season, the characters psyche is analyzed a bit more deeply and the result is... pretty lame. Actions scenes are replaced with boring dialogues between Kirito and Sinon sharing their experiences with Death and how they dealt with them. Actually I like this kind of approach in the characters but with Kirito?... God no, it doesn't feel right in SAO, it doesn't fit the anime. Cool actions scenes with great soundtrack fits more the show, but that wasn't delivered, in part. The only thing that won't miss in this sequel, in every scene, is Sinon's compact ass, we got a picture of it in every possible angle.\\n\\n\r\nIn this second installment Phantom Bullet isn't the only material adapted from the Light Novel, there's also some arcs we could consider as fillers but they aren't, they're present in the Light Novel. Only from SAO we could expect actual canon material to have that unique air that fillers have, anyway these two arcs are Caliber and Mother's Rosario. While the attempt of Excaliber is to light the mood before the heavy drama oriented Mother's Rosario, the result we get it's the exposure of The SAO Formula, yes again. Caliber focuses in Kirito's party, Sinon, already part of his harem, with the special participation of the other girls, Asuna & Company, aid Kirito to complete an ALO Quest. Meanwhile Mother's Rosario focuses on Asuna and her meet with a mysterious girl named Yuuki, drama development is guaranteed.\\n\\n\r\nLike previously commented, SAO II inherited everything from the previous season, also those things worth to be praised, the Animation, the Setting and Soundtracks. Extremely fluid animation followed through the actions scenes meanwhile -not the best Yuki Kajiura recycled work- harmonized the environment. The Setting is something I really liked from the SAO franchise, it's detailed and somehow it drags you inside, Fantasy and Fairy tale like from the previous arcs and now GGO's cyberpunk, it's notable the effort done to create this, I tip my hat. OPs & EDs singles managed to be catchy but a lot less compared to the previous season, anyway \"Courage\" by Haruka Tomatsu is worth an illegal download at least.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I wouldn't consider it a total waste of time, this show is watchable, I won't say it's a pile of crap or rage about it, I mean, if you're watching SAO II you already know how this was going to be, so I'll just express my expected disappointment with a big \"Meehhh\" and end this review right here.",

            "content": "Another flagship of the Anime Industry has ended again today. While some people would be delighted by Sao II ending, most are left wanting more and eagerly anticipating the next Sword Art Online. While the series itself is not perfect, I wouldn't say it's garbage as some would say it. I am going to cover the three arcs as separate rather than as a whole so it would highlight their strengths and weaknesses better, then combine it to an overall score.\r\nStory, Phantom Bullet(8/10): The first arc is the meat of SAO II. It has the most episodes spanning 14  of the overall 24. Here,Kirito ends up in a VR called Gun Gale Online where he is tasked to investigate the deaths of VR players in the real world by them supposedly dying in the Virtual world. The story was crafted excellently, while it did have a slow start at first, the ending was satisfying. There are however inconsistencies to how the story picks up the pace. For instance, the story already jumped to Bullet of Bullets in the very first few episodes, then it jumps to Kirito defeating other players easily, then a duel with Sinon, then after defeating Death Gun. It feels rushed even though the story presented itself well. It doesn't give itself enough time to catch up with itself, it sends Kirito to battle and ends with KIrito beating his enemies. The story though is packed with the Impossibilities like the first SAO. This Time, characters are haunted by their past , and it's up to Kirito to guide them out of it. While that may seem irrelevant to the story, it adds a little emotional impact to the overall arc.\\n\\n\r\nStory, Calibur(7/10): The second arc of SAO II. Here we find Kirito and his Harem + Klein back in Alfheim. They all do a quest to retrieve Excalibur from an Ice Kingdom and ultimately save Alfheim altogether. While it was a good watch, I felt the story was the weakest out of all the arcs. It didn't offer anything new, and it didn't bring out anything we haven't necessarily seen before in the SAO franchise. It's basically an arc dedicated for Kirito to get an upgrade. It is still refreshing to see the old team back together including Sinon to clear out dungeons and let them show off their skills after seeing Kirito slaughtering every bit of competition he has out there.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory, Mother's Rosario(9/10): The third arc, this is where I don't want to go into detail about because it's an arc where you should see for yourself. I personally think this is the best arc out  of SAO II. It doesn't focus on action as much as the previous arcs, it focuses a lot on characters and their hardships in the real world. While some may get turned off by that, it really is a good arc to see further character development in some characters. \\n\\n\r\nStory, Overall (8/10): From the first to the last arcs, the story was great. While a side arc did manage to outshine the main arc for me, it still was a great story to marvel at.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(9/10): SAO II brings to you a new cast with very enjoyable characters. Kirito, Asuna, and the old gang are still there. With the exception of Kirito, and Asuna on the third arc. Most of them were hardly touched. Kirito still drives the main story further with help from new characters. The first up is Sinon. Sinon later became my favorite heroine at the the end of the the first arc. Maybe i just have a thing for girls with a heavy anti-material rifle for a weapon. You get to see into her past and her reason to play a game like Gun Gale. She seeks strength and finds that within Kirito. The next up is Yuuki and the gang on the third arc. This is where the emotional aspect of the show is centered. Konno Yuuki is labeled as Zekken, or Absolute Sword. She is they say the strongest player in Alfheim. While she's strong in the Virtual world in the real world she faces countless problems. It's the same with the rest of the Sleeping Knights. They face numerous problems in real life, and they dive into the Virtual world to escape those problems. You see the relationship grow between Asuna and the Sleeping Knights as the story progresses. You see what the characters have to face in the real world, and their methods to escape that harsh reality. \\n\\n\r\nArt(9/10): Just like in the original SAO, SAO II brings with it fantastic looking worlds and characters. Gun Gale is just amazing to look at. it's a deserted area with tons of destroyed building and broken down vehicles. Also sand, sand everywhere. It's the perfect setting for a game like Gun Gale where bullets are flying everywhere and the world looks like its going crumbling down. Alfheim is also present with beautifully crafted atmosphere. In the Calibur arc, you see what lies underneath the world tree, it was once a prosperous land, but now it's covered in ice and snow. The new bosses and characters are also made fairly well. The back ground characters do look a lot similar, but that's understandable since drawing thousands of unique faces would be a waste of time. However the main and supporting cast all have their personal touch to their avatars which makes the look admirable. #CaitSithSinon\\n\\n\r\nSound(8/10): The sound overall was good. I don't really have much complaints for the sound even though I gave it an 8. Both Openings were amazing and characters themselves weren't annoying to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9/10): I had a lot of fun watching Sword Art Online II. It gives me more to think about when I decide to let my mind wonder. Just the thought of how close a different world can be so close to us just makes me want to watch more and more. I really do hope they come out with an SAO III, it would be to sad to see an anime as great as this with more tales to tell us stop right here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(8/10): It's an enjoyable show to watch that most people often ridicule too hard because of it's growing popularity. It's a fun series with a lot of great ideas to offer. It's not perfect having some flaws, but it's not as bad as people turn it out to be. I recommend giving the series a go and decide for yourself. Do not let anyone's opinion hinder you from enjoying this show and determine for yourself if it is worthy of your time.\\n",

            "content": "Another season, another helping of extreme controversy, a countless number of attacks on the fan base, even more flame wars, and perhaps the largest amount of unfair criticisms and double standards ever seen in an anime.\r\nIn my review of the first season, I stated that \"Sword Art Online was the most over hated anime of recent decade.\" Considering what I've seen in this season and the newest criticisms against it(despite it correcting most of the weaknesses of season 1), I still stand by what I said back then.\r\nSo what do I think of it? This season has solidified my opinion that I've had about theseries since Season 1.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like Season 1, the story of SAO II is split up into separate arcs, each with a different tone and genre. These arcs are Phantom Bullet(Gun Gale Online), Calibur, and Mother's Rosario. Two of the arcs continue the trend of showing how virtual reality affects reality, while the one in between is just a simple quest.\\n\\n\r\nKeep in mind there may be spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nPhantom Bullet(Gun Gale Online) - The story focuses on perhaps the most controversial protagonist in all of anime: Kazuto Kirigaya, and a new character for this season: Shino Asada. It's about a year after the ALO incident and, yet again, another incident occurs that involves the virtual world that seems to affect the real world. This occurs in the new VRMMO of Gun Gale Online, an MMO created from The World Seed mentioned in Season 1. A player named Death Gun(who's attire looks like a cross between a mummy and the Grim Reaper) was reported in shooting players in-game, only to have them die shortly after in real life. However, unlike the Nerve Gear, which could fry a person's brain, these cases have involved another vital organ: the heart. Because of the Amusphere's improved security mentioned in Season 1, it appears that these deaths would be impossible to cause through virtual reality. Seijirou Kikuoka, a member of the Ministry of Internal Affairs that first appeared in SAO: Extra Edition, contacts Kazuto and offers him a job to investigate, knowing just how much experience he has in the full-dive environment.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall genre of this arc is murder mystery.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this was a bit of a trade-off arc. On one hand, Kirito gets more depth as a character, Sinon(Shino Asada) develops as a character by the end of the arc, and the story can be pretty engaging with the logistics behind the GGO incident. On the other hand, the action is much more limited, some characters are STILL sidelined for the most part, and the episode before the ending of the arc comes off as all kinds of disturbing. I've always loved SAO more for the story and characters, but a few of the final episodes of this arc left me with mixed feelings.\\n\\n\r\nThis being said, it was engaging the whole way through, had much better character development, and was a HUGE step up from ALfheim. 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCalibur - I'll keep it short for this arc: it focuses on the group of Kirito, Asuna, Klein, Lisbeth, Silica, Leafa, and Sinon on a quest to J\u00f6tunheimr.\\n\\n\r\nThe genre for these episodes are mainly action.\\n\\n\r\nThis arc wasn't nearly long enough to get me emotionally invested. It was nice seeing the other SAO survivors(Klein, Silica, Lisbeth) get the spotlight for fighting, but, overall, the dungeon's setting was too bleak, and the story wasn't nearly as suspenseful as other arcs. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nMother's Rosario - This arc nearly matches up to the brilliance of Aincrad in half the episodes. Asuna's character development was the main focus of this arc and just like Sinon in Gun Gale, another character is introduced in this arc: Yuuki Konno, a swords-woman that has earned the title of \"Absolute Sword\" for being the strongest player in ALfheim.\\n\\n\r\nThis arcs' genre is mainly drama. It can be pretty heartwarming with Yuuki and Asuna's interactions, but in the end it's unbearably tragic.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like most of Aincrad, I was in tears for this arc and the friendship formed between Yuuki and Asuna was beautiful. I won't spoil the ending, but it's very tragic and you'll most likely cry if you have even a shred of empathy. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: If there's one thing every viewer of Sword Art Online can agree on, it's that it has great animation, and an amazing soundtrack. This series continues the trend, so I won't go any further. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This season did a better job in the Character Development department. Overall, the characters were very three-dimensional, and have their own problems that they have to face, such as Sinon with her PTSD fear of guns, Kirito with his inner demons that revisit him from SAO, and Yuuki with her terminal illness.\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds of the new characters are introduced well, and some of the characters from the first season get more depth.\\n\\n\r\nThis being said, quite a few of the characters are still sidelined.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned that I'd have to wait for Mother's Rosario for Asuna's character development, and this arc made up for the limited amount from Season 1 flawlessly. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I mentioned that this season solidified my opinion on the series, and that opinion is that this is my all-time favorite anime. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMother's Rosario helped me realize that Sword Art Online really lives up to the 'Art' part of the name. Not only with the many interpretations that every viewer has had(both \"masterpiece\" positive and \"train wreck\" negative), but also from how it's able to connect with the fans on a very personal level and become more of an experience rather than a simple show.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nNegative Points: Episode 13 was beyond disturbing. I won't spoil it, but it was very uncomfortable.\\n\\n\r\nAction wasn't nearly as exciting as the past season.\\n\\n\r\nUnnecessary fan service that breaks tension in episode 11.\\n\\n\r\nExcluding aspects or story points from the light novels that would have improved the overall quality of the GGO arc.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're watching the English dub of Season 2, there are two contradictory lines of dialogue. One relating to a game mechanic in ALO (beast taming) during Calibur, one relating to an event in Mother's Rosario (the floor the Sleeping Knights and the SAO survivor team clear shown in the final episode, as it's supposed to be Floor 28, but they say Floor 23). These minor plot holes are only present in the English dub. The English subbed version doesn't have this fault.\\n\\n\r\nBonus Points: Still continues the trend of presenting nearly all of the information needed for understanding the plot. This as well makes the story limited in ACTUAL Plot Holes.\\n\\n\r\nGreater focus on character development helped me to connect with the characters much more than Season 1.\\n\\n\r\nFocuses more on how VR affects reality.\\n\\n\r\nAsuna going back to being a bad-ass, and getting far more development.\\n\\n\r\nAs long as you don't interpret anything the wrong way, there really isn't any other girl character that \"falls head over heels\" for Kirito, or has a crush on him. Overall, it's just a nice friendship between him and Sinon with a little bit of cute flirting solely for the purpose of trolling.\\n\\n\r\nMother's Rosario having the biggest tear-jerking moment of all tear-jerking moments in this series. (T_T)\\n\\n\r\nCorrecting a lot of the weaknesses from Season 1.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nOverall Score: 10/10 Does a great job at improving an already amazing anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can afford to give it another chance, I'd highly recommend seeing this season.\\n\\n\r\nIf you still hold hatred for this series, and don't have the capacity for being optimistic, or giving it a chance for redemption, then there's nothing I can do.",

            "content": "I started SAO II because hearing so many people saying it would adapt arcs that are vastly superior to the previous ones made me really curious about how far this franchise could go, and I bet wasn't the only one.  As I bet that I'm not the only one who was left absolutely, utterly disappointed (but not surprised) upon seeing all of the same old bullshit that made the first season so terrible repeating itself.\r\nThis review may contain spoilers from now on.\r\nSword Art Online II adapts two arcs from the novels: GGO and Mother's Rosario. Oh no, wait, it's three arcs: there's also theCalibur arc - hard to remember it even existed considering it lasted for about three episodes and had no relevance to anything at all. But again, is there even a point to anything in this show other than showcasing how amazing & powerful Kirito is and adding new girls to his harem? I guess not. SAO remains what it is in its core: a self-insert show with childish writing scattered everywhere.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about each arc individually. The first one, GGO, is the least weak of the bunch (not that this means anything when all of them are bad). It features Sinon, a new member of Kirito's harem - I mean, heroine, as well as a new setting. The fact that they cast aside an entirely underveloped cast of characters to introduce a new girl should already be stinky - but as if that's not enough, GGO is very sloppily written. They use the most ridiculous excuse to connect the current events to events that happened back in the first arc (I mean sure, the laughing coffin members murdered people 'n stuff, but it makes all sense that they're still out in the loose and not in jail!), as well as a MASSIVE amount of stupidity such as \"People are getting murdered inside of a game again? Well geez, I guess our only solution is sending in this 17 year old all alone to investigate this!\" The logic in this arc is piss-poor, and as anyone can guess, everything is resolved by Kirito finding out all by himself how the villain was working and who he was, with little to no base at all. I mean of course, Kirito is so awesome he figured everything out by himself! It made all the attempts made in the very same arc of giving him flaws and depth a complete joke. This arc's main antagonist is also a pathetic piece of turd with terrible characterization - you know something's wrong when a villain's entire backstory, motives and goals are explained by the protagonists while they're chatting and having coffee.\\n\\n\r\nCalibur may as well be summed up in a single phrase: What was the point? It features the \"main cast\", if they can even be called that, clearing a quest in ALO. And yeah. That's all. It feels like really, REALLY bad filler, and I have nothing else to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the last arc, Mother's Rosario: it's an arc where Asuna is the protagonist, along with Yuuki, another newly introduced character. To put it shortly, this arc will do ANYTHING to make you cry. It's as if the writer was noticing that he didn't look \"mature\" enough with the whole in-game murder thing and thought to himself \"I need to add some more drama to this\". So cue Yuuki's storyline - no, cue Yuuki's entire character, who was designed to make you cry with the whole \"My whole family is dead and I have a terminal disease\" thing. Predictably, they deal with this in a very insensitive way - it's not organic, it's not presented naturally, it's 100% designed to make you pity her. Yuuki is more defined by the fact that she's terminally ill than by her bland personality, which makes the second time in SAO II where the writer uses an illness as an accessory to earn easy tears and seem mature (the first time being with Sinon's PTSD). But as you can guess, the way it's presented and dealt with isn't mature at all, it's borderline insulting. Mother's Rosario is also supposed to be an arc where Asuna gets developed as her own character, but considering that her biggest conflict was convincing her mother that she was ready to drop everything else in her life to be with Kirito, it only furthered her role as the lead waifu of his harem.\\n\\n\r\nIf I talk about the characters it will take me another 10 paragraphs, so let me try to keep it short. Kirito is still the same thing as in the first season: Amazing, cool, incredible, smart Kirito, who finds out the truth behind serial murders by himself, cures Sinon's trauma by himself and is apparently also a mechanics genius who can make video game characters see the real world. They try to give him depth in GGO by showing that he's truly traumatized by the events of Aincrad, but it backfires horribly when right after it's shown that he's a \"strong person who keeps moving foward regardless\", a.k.a. he can get over it quite easily if the plot calls for it. They also tried to give Kirito a goal in him striving to unite the virtual and real world as one, but it backfired again as it's clear that nobody gave it enough thought to realize how stupid, dangerous and almost villainous this sounds. His smug-ish attitude towards Sinon also remains unchanged from the previous arcs, so don't worry, he's still an annoying prick on top of being a terrible self-insert character.\\n\\n\r\nSinon had everything to be a good character, as she's the first heroine in this show with a palpable personality, but they sacrifice it to make her the tsundere that was missing in Kirito's harem. They use her being understandably wary of him as an excuse to make her act tsun-tsun. There's also her backstory, which could have been good if the writer had even a slight idea of how panick attacks and PTSD actually work instead of getting them triggered whenever's convenient to the plot. Her character development revolves 100% around Kirito. Sinon's role in the show is defined by the moment she says \"Someone, please save me\" in episode 3: she wasn't there to be a character who learns to save herself and grows in the first place, she was there to be saved by Kirito and later fall in love with him. She was there to be nothing more than another disposable harem member disguised as \"strong female character\". In the end, Sinon is no better than Asuna.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Asuna, she succeeded on having the most bullshit \"character development\" I've ever seen. Introducing her family out of nowhere and sparkling conflict with her strict mother wouldn't have been that unacceptable, really, if at least she had something to fight for herself, but it doesn't count if said conflict is her mother not wanting to let her ruin her life getting married young (to Kirito, of course). Asuna's entire character arc isn't about her growing as a person, it's about strengthening her resolve to get married to Kirito - as IF she needed that, considering that her entire character is defined by her love and devotion for Kirito in the first place. Mother's Rosario did nothing for Asuna as a character as much as it did for her as a \"waifu\". She will probably be even more loved by otaku now that she fits the \"perfect wife\" stereotype better than ever, but it sure as hell doesn't make her well written. She, Kirito and their sappy romance remain as flat and unsavory as ever.\\n\\n\r\nI could write about the other characters if there even was something noteworthy to say about them. Suguha was dropped into limbo after ALO and has no relevance in the second season, but that's to be expected - if you're a female character in SAO, you only have two jobs: Falling in love/getting rescued by Kirito in a certain arc and providing fanservice. After that, it's as if you never even existed in first place. The only thing I can say about Suguha, Rika and Silica (and Sinon after GGO) is that the way they get angry at Kirito for getting attention from Asuna is extremely immature, annoying and unfunny considering that they are, you know, engaged. But again all the comedic moments in SAO sound like they were written by a horny 13 year old boy, so I guess it's nothing new after all.\\n\\n\r\nI don't have a lot to say about the animation except that in some scenes it looks pretty good and carefully done and in others it's literally slideshow bullshit (look at the first Calibur episode, for God's sake). Overall, it doesn't look bad. The sound is ok, too. None of it is bad, but also not good enough to even remotely come close of saving anything in this show, so I won't even bother talking about it any further.\\n\\n\r\nWell, now you can downvote me to your heart's content.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online is a series that needs no introduction. To be quite frank, the first season spawned a lot of controversy with the adaptation. As a show taking place in an online realm, the series had a lot of potential but never really capitalized on them when it came down with the story and characters. Luckily, season 2 does freshen up a bit with some brand new storylines and characters. In particular, one of the first story arcs involves Kirito stepping forward into a new realm known as GGO. \r\nTo trace back a bit, the series is based off a light novel of thesame name written by Reki Kawahara. As a 2 cour series, this sequel focuses on three different arcs that are adapted from the light novel starting with GGO (stands for Gun Gale Online although the actual arc is titled Phantom Bullet). While the name seems unorthodox (guns in a show with a title called SWORD art online?), the arc actually deepens its mechanics in ways that are more profound than the original. The first few episodes highlight this by exposition and explaining thanks to a young girl Kirito meets in-game named Sinon. Regardless of how GGO functions, Kirito\u2019s main goal isn\u2019t to actually win but to find out a mysterious killer who seems to know him. Meanwhile, we learn more about Sinon and her fear of guns that leads her to make a goal of herself: to get over that fear. While the motivations of both characters are farfetched, there\u2019s a definite connection between the two as the game progresses.\\n\\n\r\nNow, introducing a brand new major character can be a hassle. Luckily though, Sinon isn\u2019t a weakling and she has the resolve to accomplish her goals. We also get flashbacks with concrete background information on her so nothing is left out to make viewers wonder her motivation. But the problem still remains with Kirito and his self-centered goals. While it doesn\u2019t necessarily ruin the arc, his goal of trying to hunt down a cyber-killer is nothing less than generic and similar to ALO (remember him trying to find a villain who tried to ruin his life and Asuna\u2019s?). Somehow though, the arc does manage to connect Kirito and Sinon despite some clingy and over-dramatic dialogues. A few episodes also stretches a bit to highlight how close they become in-game, despite them being enemies at one point. The ending of the arc is nonetheless predictable with Kirito playing a hero like the usual poster boy. The good news is that the GGO arc has great concept with its competitive angle. Competitors, weapons, and setting is visually adapted with elegance and astonishing features. Even the cyber-killer looks convincing enough to be called a menace with some cool gadgets to show off. And Kirito still remains very OP for someone new to the GGO world. When it comes to the action front though, GGO is where the game can be proud of itself. However, the antagonists from the arc is downright stereotypical, generic, and has a delusional purpose when the audience finds out the truth of their goals. Did I also mention predictable? SAO is a lot of things and the show never seems to escape that word.\\n\\n\r\nAs the series covers three different arcs, there\u2019s an intermission of sorts. Perhaps I\u2019m saying this wrong but the episodes taking place between GGO and Mother\u2019s Rosario (the other major arc to be adapted this season) feels like so. In this so called Calibur arc, the series returns to its generic setting of sword fighting in their online virtual realm. Kirito also gets a new sword to show off while his female companions seems to try to get their senpai to notice them. The arc is fairly standard and predictable that uses tricks from the old books. However, I do give praise to the choreography and action presented. Every character gets some kind of highlight with their skills. It\u2019s important to realize this since it also allows the viewers to see how far their skills developed since the first season. One other important element to notice in this arc is teamwork as the arc doesn\u2019t just give Kirito all the screen time. Even Klein, a character that some people might have forgotten from SAO, returns and gives the audience something to remember about. To me though, this seems like a preparation to what\u2019s to come soon; a way for the characters to stretch out their muscles and be like \u201cWe\u2019re ready to take on anything now\u201d.  Still, it lacked much depth or appeal with the story development.\\n\\n\r\nThe final arc of the season titled \u2018Mother Rosario\u2019 take up the remainder of the season. This arc has more of a slice of life and action-centric flick mixed in together. While it starts off slow, the arc gets to its point quickly once the mechanics and backgrounds are fleshed out. Asuna, a character that seemed almost completely pathetic during ALO, finally gets a chance to redeem herself in this arc. Rather than have her knight in shining armor (Kirito) do all the dirty work, she takes it upon herself to deal with a new conflict. Most importantly is how we see Asuna and her family is like, in particular with her mother. It shows a different side of her lifestyle beyond just spending time with her boyfriend. There\u2019s also a case of ideology that can be seen as controversial depending on whose side you agree with. But for what it\u2019s worth, the arc bounces between real life issues and in-game motivations; a direction that definitely outshines its first half. Not to mention, the action scenes are fairly well done with decent OST and coordination when it comes down to the actual dueling. The arc expands beyond just dueling though as we learn more about the new character (Yuuki) involved and what the audience may be carving for. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to visuals, it\u2019s fairly standard to see that SAO has touches of fantasy to it whether it would be the settings, characters, monsters, or whatever else you would typically see from an RPG game. Similar to season 1, A-1 Pictures adapts this based on the light novel designs. While fan service toned down a bit, there\u2019s also some zany gimmicks used such as gender bender and the animal characteristics. In spite of this, the GGO setting is one I found to be the most evolved on the visual front. Taking a closer look, the landscapes is desolate but rich with details for a perfect setting for battle. Not only that but characters are designed like they actually have the edge to fight as if their life is on the line; unlike the previous season where some character had cardboard box designs. Action and production values also strengthened with more stylized movements. However, most of the returning main characters still remains generic to their character designs with little change. They are unmemorable on physical standards although I do give some praise to Sinon\u2019s character.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is perhaps the weakest detail of the sequel. Nothing is really changed to the OST besides some minor adjustment while character voice mannerisms remains generally the same. While the first OP song is catchy, the remainder are mediocre that almost all sound the same. Most of the voice castings are also very standard with cheesy dialogues and overused words often to highlight some sense of emotional value; although real life conversation between some characters are worthwhile in particular with Asuna and her mother. I have some mixed feelings with Sinon\u2019s voice with that tomboy tone of hers. While she definitely has a sense of independence with that tone, it also seems bratty at times and feels cranky. Other times though, she can be appreciable when we see her as a person.\\n\\n\r\nAs a sequel, SAO II is definitely an improvement of the first season. It gave returning characters more development and screen-time on their own while also debuting new characters with their purpose. The first arc (GGO) highlights the mechanics of the game at a much better way than the first season while also has a meaningful purpose for Sinon. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t escape the usual \u201chero save the day\u2019 shenanigan or one dimensional villains with their mojo. But for what\u2019s worth, SAO\u2019s technical aspects shines more than what is expected when it comes to action. The Calibur and GGO arc are a testament of this while Mother Rosario also gets its moments with consistent choreography such as the dueling scenes. As the show did evolve, this sequel does have potential but don't expect a huge blockbuster.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up:\\n\\n\r\nThe story (GGO/Phantom Bullet: 6/10), (Calibur: 4/10), (Mother Rosario: 8/10 ) \u2013 each of them offers something new to the tables; some still suffers from generics and weakly developed tropes.\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10) \u2013 rather than Kirito become the host of his own show, we get development of Asuna and Yuuki, focus on Sinon, and also teamwork during the Calibur arc with each character getting some sort of spotlight\\n\r\nArtwork (8/10) \u2013 much better than season 1\\n\r\nSoundtrack (5/10) \u2013 repetitive and edgy along with second rated voice mannerisms\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10) \u2013 a fun adventure with different feelings of each arc\\n",

            "content": "It was Fall of 2012, and it almost seemed as though the world was in a bleak dark place of temper tantrums and violent outbursts. These were formed due to the nature of one simple questions: Is/Was Sword Art Online really that good or bad? Both sides had convincing arguments to their reasons for disliking or liking the show. But, ultimately, it has now become a staple of how every year, there is that one over-hyped show that defines anime of that year. Now it\u2019s 2014 and we finally have its sequel under the cheers and groans that look forward to or dread it.\r\nNow theone question remains amidst to its conclusion: Is Sword Art Online II better than Sword Art Online? The answer being: yes\u2026 kind of?\\n\\n\r\nMake no mistake I was, and am, of the camp that did not see the general appeal to Sword Art Online. With its sometimes flashy action sequences and brilliant score became a general mess of incoherent pacing, god awful 2nd half, and atrocious character development. Going forward with Sword Art Online II, all but one of these negatives that I had with its prequel are officially gone: character development. Of course, this is due to the fact that the prequel introduced these characters, albeit a short while, so now with the sequel, we are able to get to know these supporting characters a fair bit more than at first glance. This in turn makes them a little bit more relatable and likable in that scenario.\\n\\n\r\nNow there are characters that are new to the series that make their debut in this sequel. Sinon being the most notable and hyped character, it is poignant to see how she holds up as a character all her own. From her standout arc, Gun Gale Online, there are some positives to her that I can see clearly but other times I see plenty of negatives that keep her from being great. To put it more into perspective, Sinon has a likable presence and personality that is easily relatable, but her character arcs involving her psychological trauma is, suffice to say, hokey. Her unwillingness to shoot a gun, and yet is able to shoot at most enemies in the game with no hesitation whatsoever comes across as a bit counter-intuitive.\\n\\n\r\nThis hokey logic can be applied to the story at large. Although I will say that the story is, by far, the one thing that they didn\u2019t make even worse from the prequel. the hiccups there are in leaps of logic, and trust me there are some, most of them don\u2019t come near close to how badly they were beforehand. There is, of course, the unfortunate illness to the series where the 2nd half of Sword Art Online just becomes weaker as it goes along. Whereas in the previous season it was messy storytelling throughout the 2nd half, here its just flat out dull and meandering. All it is just an uneventful, sappy melodrama involving Asuna and one other character whose backstory I won\u2019t spoil. And really, the less Asuna in any season, the better.\\n\\n\r\nEven with the problematic story elements aside, there are certainly a few moments in Sword Art Online 2 that seem almost laughable in its attempt to be serious. One instance being one of the antagonists going on a full-on psychopathic meltdown on our hero Sinon that goes on for almost five minutes. I almost felt as though the voice actor couldn\u2019t do the script justice and tried his best to make it dire, but failed to do so. What went on was this overacting scene that felt way longer than it needed to be; at the same time it did give me one of the hilarious moments in anime this year.\\n\\n\r\nNow we have what many come for Sword Art Online for: the butts. Er, I mean, the animation and sound! Seriously though, unanimously, everyone can make the case that this series has really good production values. It does have some nice slick backgrounds with really nice lighting to make the world feel vibrant and alive. With this, we have the fighting scenes to go with it, which I seem to be of the minority that the fight scenes in Sword Art Online are pretty mediocre at best. Compared to other shounen shows that do their actions scenes well, here in Sword Art Online 2, most of the fight scenes are pretty tame. Hell, the first one had way more in terms of quality action and even then it didn\u2019t hold a candle to other better fighting shows out there. This entails from how the characters\u2019 actions seem very disjointed and their movements feel rough around the edges at certain points. Nevertheless, when it\u2019s not going for fast paced action, the art and animation is quite stunning for the eyes to see and gander at.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be far-pressed to express some sort of relief that the sequel brought us something that\u2019s not unwatchable, even if it still wasn\u2019t a great final product in the long run. For what it\u2019s worth, I could see myself watching this again; at least, insomuch how I would prefer it over the prequel, if I had a choice. It still can\u2019t be given a passing grade from the story\u2019s pacing and writing problems that lower its quality amongst other shows that deserve it more. As if that wasn\u2019t enough for over-hyped shows to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: C-\\n",

One day, Seijiro Kikuoka from the \"VR division\" asks Kirito to investigate about a rumour that was spreaded in a game called Gun Gale Online, where, if you get shot by a mysterious avatar with a black gun, you will die irl, Kirito is reluctant at first, but gets curious about it and ends up accepting the job. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9.\\n\\n\r\nAs usual, SAO's visual are AMAZING, not much to say here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is really fitting, from the OP to the ED, you can get an idea of the characters, their struggles and their wishes. The OST, as usual, amazing, one of Kajiura's best jobs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, we have our so-loved and so-hated MC, Kirito, getting some development and action here and there, no need to say much about him. \\n\\n\r\nThen, we have Sinon/Shino, the female lead in this arc (no, Asuna doesn't appear much) one of the best snipers in GGO nicknamed \"Icy Sniper\" because of her calm personality during battles. She wants to win the Bullet of Bullets, GGO tournament. As a character, she is really well done, she has a backstory, development and courage.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason my enjoyment is low compared to the rest is, the butt shots, this seriously ruined some scenes in this arc, Sinon's ass was focused A LOT in 14 episodes, even during serious scenes, made the anime kinda annoying.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.6, compared to the 9 i gave this in LN, all thanks to ass shots, A-1, you're the real MVP.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: This is really good, the pace is the opposite to SAO1, it's slow and takes its time to develop but be prepared to see Sinon's ass A LOT, music and animation are awesome as usual, if you like Psychology, VR and Games, you should try this, if you are expecting a lot of action, you should go somewhere else.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nCaliber Arc (eps. 15 - 17)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6.\\n\\n\r\nThis mini-arc is a Side Story, shows the entire group doing a quest to get the Legendary Sword Excalibur, it also explains the Cardinal System, really needed for possible SAO3.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9.\\n\\n\r\nNew OP by Haruka Tomatsu and ED by LiSA, loved both of them, really good as usual, the OST really fitting for the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8. \\n\\n\r\nAs usual, amazing. The battles are nice, the magic effects are done wonderfully.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7.\\n\\n\r\nIt's the whole group, there is not really a need to explain all of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nWell, it's a side story, it had fun, action, some little romance here and there, nothing so impressive, but good nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 compared to the 7.3 in the LN, well, some scenes were changed, but still solid.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Not impressive, but its fine for a laugh or killing time, sound is awesome, explains Cardinal System for better understanding of next arcs.\\n\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nMother's Rosario Arc (eps. 18 - 24)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, we get to the best arc this season, Mother's Rosario. In ALO, there's a rumour about a player nicknamed as \"Absolute Sword\" who has been doing a lot of duels in some island. With 69 wins at row, this player catches Asuna's attention, specially after hearing that Kirito lost against him. Who is this player? Why is he doing so much duels? Prepare for the feels.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10.\\n\\n\r\nAmazing, nuff said.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10.\\n\\n\r\nTHIS soundtrack, same OP by Haruka Tomatsu but new sequence, new ED by LiSA called Shirushi, both songs are amazing, specially the ED with all the feels, OST is great also.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, we have Asuna, our so-loved and so-hated female MC. In this arc, we see some development for her, we can also see how is her relationship with her family, which will lead to a trip full of feels.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have, Zekken, probably, one of the BEST SAO characters, even in the LN, strong, fast, this player holds a big secret which is going to send you to feeladelphia. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10.\\n\\n\r\nI loved everything about this arc, was adapted really well, the scenes, soundtracks and everything portrayed its meaning perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: An arc full of feels, a new player with 69 wins at row, one of those against Kirito, this player will have some serious effect not only in the story, but Asuna as well, it's really worth watching.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nOverall for SAO2: 8.6, rounded up to 9. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are a SAO fan, you could like this, even if youre a hater, the story is really well written, most of the failures are from animation itself. But don't expect so much action, its slow paced, but its really worth a shot.",

            "content": "It is time to review a story that never should have taken place. By any measure of realism and sensible writing, the show would have ended after their escape from SAO, the technology would have been banned in the wake of the public outrage, and there would be no need for further walls of snarky reviews at MAL.\r\nBut there was more money to be made, and what are realism and sensible writing compared to that? So here we are then.\r\nWhen reviewing season 1, I implied that the second arc was a cashcow, and I feel the same applies here. It is a thinly veiled attemptto stretch out the SAO franchise for quick cash, a calculated money-grabbing venture. A part of what makes it that way is that these new arcs don't contribute much to the overall narrative. It's just adventuring for the sake of adventuring. It doesn't help that each arc is fairly self-contained, with a jarring transition from one arc to another. Now, I'm not against multiple plotlines but here's an idea: try developing them simultaneously, side by side. It would also improve the show from a world-building perspective, creating a stronger illusion of an actual world instead of this clip show of the protagonist's adventures. \\n\\n\r\nThis season is divided into no fewer than three arcs, so I'll have to go through them one by one.\\n\\n\r\nGun Gale Online arc: 3\\n\\n\r\nThis is the longest of the three arcs, taking up 14 of 24 episodes, so it stands to reason that the most effort should have gone into this. Predictably enough, this is not the case and it drops the ball right at the starting line. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise is that players of a virtual reality MMO, Gun Gale Online, are dying in real life after being shot by a magic gun called the Death Gun. This gun is wielded by the creatively named character, Death Gun, who is subtly dressed in robes and a steel mask so that nobody could figure out he's the bad guy. How are the authorities going to investigate this? Track Death Gun's IP address? No, of course not. That would be stupid. Obviously the only way to solve this problem is to call Kirito. \\n\\n\r\nFor the record, there is an in-universe reason why they can't track Death Gun down: the people running the game are apparently refusing to hand over his player info. Furthermore, they are in the United States, and obviously the American authorities won't ask them or simply place them under surveillance because... shut up. Seriously, if you're going to use that as an excuse, at least place them into a third-world country or something. After the SAO and ALO incidents, I can't believe for a second that there'd be such a lack of government oversight. If all else failed, they could simply threaten to launch a negative media campaign over the deaths to force the GGO staff to hand over the data or go bankrupt.\\n\\n\r\nThis is something I mentioned in my SAO review, but I cannot emphasize it enough. After the SAO disaster and the consequential mass hysteria, it would have only been realistic to ban the technology. It doesn't matter if the new hardware is safer. People just wouldn't trust it. After all, the old death trap passed safety inspections with flying colors too. (I'm being generous here and assuming they actually have safety inspections in the SAO-verse. I could be wrong.) Add to that the ALO incident where government safeguards failed again, and this lack of regulation and oversight becomes all the more ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\n*cough*\\n\r\nAnyway, Kirito is asked to put his life on the line in an MMO again. You'd think he would refuse after spending two years trapped in a life-and-death struggle, but we wouldn't have a new story otherwise, so after brief hesitation he jumps right in. He logs into GGO without any kind of prior experience of the game or any weapons or a pool of funding. He also converted his old account, so he is going with his famous standard username. These government-funded covert operations sure are overrated. \\n\\n\r\nSo why did they ask Kirito who has no experience in this game, especially given how it's played by professionals for cash prizes? The reason is simply that he can be trusted because of his earlier involvement. ...Okay, I might buy that if Kirito was just going to play casually, but instead he joins the tournament where all the top players gather. Realistically he'd be eliminated right away, but this is Kirito we're talking about, so he's immediately better at it than the people who make their living out of it. This is because he has the good sense to bring a sword into a gun fight, and by sword I mean lightsaber, complete with Star Wars sound effects. It's only fitting that he has godlike reflexes and can deflect bullets with his sword, up to slicing them in half in midair. In a word, he is a Jedi. \\n\\n\r\nI mentioned gun fights because GGO resembles a first-person shooter. The strange part is that you can see bullet lines to predict enemy shots, with the exception of a sniper's first shot, which is an odd design choice to say the least, or rather it ruins the whole thing. But Kirito has figured out it can be faster to just look where the gun is pointing or follow their eyes. Why nobody else has realized this simple fact is beyond me, but that's apparently how it is. It is this insight, along with his overpowered reflexes, that allows him to easily beat an allegedly impossible minigame no one else could. \\n\\n\r\nHe also encounters a female sniper called Sinon who suffers from PTSD and is morbidly afraid of guns in real life. Which is naturally why she's playing a gun-themed MMO as a form of therapy and is completely fine with guns within the game. Probably not the first line of therapy I'd recommend. She is also frequently used for fanservice, which shouldn't really surprise anyone. \\n\\n\r\nIf that wasn't bad enough, Kirito is pretending to be a girl to gain Sinon's trust and apparently to troll random male players. This gives an opportunity for additional fanservice in case Sinon isn't enough. I wonder if he even takes his girlfriend and adopted daughter seriously if he's fine flirting with not only women but also men. I'm also going to be generous here and assume nobody can use an avatar of the opposite gender in these MMOs because otherwise people assuming that he is female in real life is just ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nThe lack of continuity becomes apparent when a raid against player-killers in SAO (by which I mean the original Aincrad arc) is retconned into the story instead of presenting it during season one. Kirito also suddenly gets PTSD over the events of SAO, despite never having problems before. Thankfully he can trivially overcome these problems, and his heroic bravery also inspires Sinon. Yes, even Kirito's flaws are portrayed as strengths.\\n\\n\r\nEventually Kirito figures out the culprit's MO by some guesswork and proceeds with a plan to obtain his name that shouldn't really work. But it does. I also think it might have been a good idea to contact the authorities beforehand and send surveillance teams and security to the relevant locations, but we've seen how well-prepared this covert operation has been, so maybe it wouldn't have made a difference. GGO also displays its high safety standards with the lack of manual logout during tournaments, which sounds damn ominous after the SAO massacre. \\n\\n\r\nThis is followed by infodumping the villain's backstory at the last minute. Without going into spoilers, the ultimate reveals are not worth it. Death Gun's identity is extremely anticlimactic, his method of killing is very situational, and his motivation can barely be called one. There is also the obligatory attempted rape scene to establish that the villain is in fact evil. You can't trust the audience to figure that one out on their own.\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing. In his spare time Kirito is developing revolutionary virtual reality applications. Sounds like a bit of a stretch for him alone compared to, say, a massive research team, but this is Kirito after all.\\n\\n\r\nExcaliber arc: 3\\n\\n\r\nKirito and co. must take on a new quest to save the world of Alheim Online from a dreadful menace: their save files getting erased!\\n\\n\r\nSo, yeah, they are questing in ALO for three episodes, and if they lose, nobody will die, but game data will be erased. How is this a problem, you ask? Well... there are no backups. It uses a core program derived from SAO whose functionality isn't fully known. Of course the staff is also unavailable because they are all on holiday. \\n\\n\r\nSo let me get this straight. This is an MMO where\\n\r\n- the game may arbitrarily decide to have its map implode,\\n\r\n- there are no real backups of the game world,\\n\r\n- the staff hasn't bothered to check the system thoroughly enough to realize this possibility, or simply doesn't care, and\\n\r\n- the GMs aren't always on call, even though this game uses the same software as the infamous SAO.\\n\\n\r\nI can picture it now.\\n\r\n\"Hey, something strange is going on. I'm trapped inside the game and can't log out.\"\\n\r\n\"It is currently outside support hours. Please send your query during regular support hours.\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd, yes, I know that they don't understand how it works because they didn't build it from a scratch. But here's the thing: if you don't understand how it works, don't use it! Especially if it's software from an infamous death trap known to be full of surprises. I mentioned earlier that the technology would have probably been banned, but if it isn't even fully understood, I'd say banning it might have been a good idea.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual questing is pretty much just beating up some bosses and other enemies in a dungeon and short interaction with NPCs. Actually, there are some newly introduced AI characters (I suppose the threat is legit to them), but they don't get much screentime, so it's hard to develop any connection. I don't dislike the idea of having people do normal MMOing, but it would work better if the show was about that from the start. If you have death games, murder investigations and so on, a few random episodes of normal MMOing won't fit in. It is little more than a filler arc. And while you're at it, flesh out the game mechanics more. Watching a Let's Play usually works better if you understand more firmly what's going on. \\n\\n\r\nMother's Rosario arc: 5\\n\\n\r\nThe last seven episodes decide to go with \"the feels\" tactics and appeal to emotion. It's actually a familiar idea from the first season: the show introduces some new characters and, guess what, pretty soon some tragic things happen to them. Unfortunately, I found it hard to become emotionally invested in people who have only been introduced a moment earlier, especially if it's obvious they only exist for this purpose. You see, the tragedy is an incredibly unlikely stroke of bad luck, almost implausible, which makes it look very plot-convenient. The show tries to make them more meaningful by presenting deep friendship between the old and new characters in a short timeframe. It succeeds halfway, but it's still bordering on implausibly fast. At least the situation provides an application for virtual MMO technology, but it could have been handled in a way that looks less convenient.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and the main character for this arc is Asuna, which is a refreshing change from Kirito, I suppose. She is a bit less overpowered too, if only a bit, not that fighting is really the focus here. Still, we do get to see a moment where Kirito single-handedly overpowers several dozen players, but at least it's only once.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also another subplot in which Asuna and her mother talk about their relationship and her future career. And by future career I mean marriage prospects, for which Kirito is unsuitable simply because he isn't loaded with enough cash. In case anyone hasn't figured out by this description, or by season one's Alfheim arc for that matter, Asuna has absolutely terrible parents who care about her daughter's status and bank account more than her free will and emotional well-being. I don't get how Asuna can even be on speaking terms with them after the events of season one, but apparently this is the case, if only barely. Still, the interaction is believable enough and manages to produce some much needed character growth, making it one of the better parts of the season.\\n\\n\r\nStory overall: 4\\n\r\nIt may not be as off-the-rails as season one, and there aren't any ridiculous timeskips, but instead we get a fragmented season with little connection between the arcs. And the arcs themselves have their own problems.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\\n\r\nKirito: The man himself, as overpowered as ever. As far as his personality goes, it's hard to detect any notable growth. The PTSD aspect was easily overcome and it seemed artificial considering that he had never had these problems before. But the real problem is the same as before: he never has anything interesting to say. I mean, really: it's just dull heroic lines or generic exposition. No wit, no eloquence, no charisma. Kirito is an all-out action hero, but that's all he is. He is no strategist, and he isn't much use for conversation either. \\n\\n\r\nAsuna: Finally gets out of Kirito's shadow and gets some development that makes her more of an actual human being. We learn more about her family, the problems in her personal life, and so on. By the way, there isn't any real development in her relationship with Kirito, but how could there be given how it's portrayed as nigh perfect from the start?\\n\\n\r\nAsuna's mother: Not the kind of mother I'd like to have, but I can see people like this existing. She does get fleshed out a bit though.\\n\\n\r\nSinon: The PTSD aspect is handled so unrealistically it's hard to take it seriously, and its resolution is almost arbitrary. After the first arc she becomes irrelevant, much like most of the side characters in this show.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Gun: Could have been handled better, to say the least, and by that I mean both his virtual and real-world self. For starters, how about giving him some better motivation? They say that the villain makes the plot, but here there is almost neither.\\n\\n\r\nYuuki: She receives barely enough screentime. It's far more than most of the side characters, but that isn't saying much. Her backstory and role in the plot feel too convenient.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the old cast: Barely exist. They get to appear a few times, but they don't really do much. If there is anything worth mentioning, it's that Klein not getting a girlfriend has become a running gag.\\n\\n\r\nTechnically there are a few that I didn't mention, such as Sinon's friend who only exists to be inferior to Kirito in Sinon's eyes, and the government official guy who just stands there unable to get anything done while Kirito saves the day. But that is already being generous. You would think that a show about MMOs would do some world-building by introducing a greater number of characters and portraying their relationships, but nope. Only a few other characters are meaningful to the plot. Kirito himself hogs much of the screentime, though it isn't nearly as ridiculous as in season one.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals: 8\\n\r\nAgain, this must be where they spent the cash. The visuals look great. GGO in particular has very nice backgrounds, ranging from massive steampunk cities to postapocalyptic ruins and wastelands. ALO may feel like a repetition of season one, but the execution is good nonetheless. The fanservice is probably less impressive, but what else is new? The second and third openings have pretty great visual design and the last ending likewise.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nGets the job done pretty well. The voice acting, opening and ending songs, and the soundtrack are all good enough.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nThe slower pacing somewhat hurts the possible \"so bad it's good\" effect compared to last season. If we're talking about legit enjoyment, Mother's Rosario takes the lead by far.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nKirito continues his epic struggle to trivially beat everyone in his path, even if it doesn't take all season this time. It made some money though, so who am I to judge?",

            "content": "When Sword Art Online II appears, a beam of light peep out in my mind and hope that the sequel able to cover all its mistakes.\r\nBut again, my hope was shattered into a dust\r\nBased off the light novel written by Reki Kawahara, Sword Art Online II is a sequel of Sword Art Online. The series started after the Alfheim Online's Arc, in a new game called Gun Gale Online, where a string of deaths begins occurring in the game. Our main character, Kirigaya Kazuto is assigned to enter Gun Gale Online to investigate the cause of the deaths. \r\nThe story is divided into 3 arcs:Gun Gale Online (or Phantom Bullet), Calibur, and Mother's Rosario.\\n\\n\r\nThe story adapts the same conflict of the previous series (the point of murdered inside a game), but in a different way. The story offers us a great action and fierce battle scene. At the Gun Gale Online arc, the story has a decent orientation and still manage to bring the main idea of the story itself. But after the GGO arc, I found out that Sword Art Online once again failed to live up to my expectation. After the GGO arc, there is a dull arc (Calibur Arc) where the fillers leak out from all directions. Into the last arc, Mother's Rosario is an arc that transforms this into a drama series in a bad way. They force up a few episodes into tears while forgetting the main story itself, and causes a heavy damage to the ending itself. Again, SAO is failed to revive itself.\\n\\n\r\nLet's forget the story section and move to the animation section. The animation is done by A-1 Picture, they bring a wonderful and attractive animation which became the main reason to watch this anime. And became the diamond itself within the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound section, the seiyuu did fairly well when bringing such character to the screen. The 1st opening theme \"Ignite\" sung by Eir Aoi really describe the GGO arc very well, the other soundtracks are decent.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, Sword Art Online II does the same poor development on the character section. Our new female lead, Sinon is the only character that having an interesting and meaningful development. While our male lead, Kirigaya Kazuto is far behind our new female lead, same as our old female lead, Yuuki Asuna. The Kirito's harem and his friend are same too. Other characters besides Sinon are not having a single development at all. Also, the main antagonist of the GGO arc had a relatively weak motive. \\n\\n\r\nI found Sword Art Online II shine brightly in my enjoyment at the Gun Gale Online arc. After that, SAO doesn't have anything in its storage, just a dull and fair entertainment in our glance. It is fairly recommended to the big fans of the SAO series. Overall, I think SAO once again fell into the darkness.....\\n\\n",

            "content": "-- Overview --\r\nThe SAO franchise, and particularly SAO II, is a very controversial series. It is disliked by a lot of people, and the complaints are quite damning. For these people the story seems disjointed, the characters make decisions that don\u2019t make sense, and the pacing is all over the place. Those that make such complaints are happy to describe how they think they would act if they ever found themselves in a similar situation. These people generally have something in common. They have either never played any MMOs, or played them very casually. In this I am sorry because they will likely never understandthe depth that this anime has to offer beyond a few nice pictures and pretty songs. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime, and the entire series, is a love story for and to the MMO players, made by MMO players. That means many, if not most, of the intricacies of the story and characters, and indeed even much of the message fails to come through if you do not have fairly extensive hardcore experience in MMOs. This is unfortunate, because the depth of this anime is on par with some of the greatest stories I have seen in this medium. To make matters more difficult, the story requires a very good understanding of the plot and themes of the first SAO to completely appreciate. It is simply not be well suited for casual watching; little details of vital importance flash for short seconds, often in completely unexpected scenes. Characters do things that are easy to misinterpret unless you can understand out what\u2019s going on in their heads. The relation between the various events are rarely spelled out, leaving you to fill in some of the blanks yourself. All of these are things that make sense if you remember the source material is a book. The anime is very true to the book, and thus it should be watched with the same amount of attention and tolerance that you would put into reading a good novel. \\n\\n\r\nIf you can accept the level of engagement required, SAO II is an absolutely wonderful experience. It paints an accurate picture of what those of the mid-2010s thought life would be like in 2025. It covers some of the most important questions that you could ask. It tells a story that knows that it's better to show, rather than tell. Best of all, it does so in a package of impeccable artistic quality; sporting both gorgeous art, and very atmospheric music. This is quite critical for the story. Due to the absence of a novel\u2019s narrator, the series has a penchant of dropping into the point of view of the various characters. This is often the only gateway the viewers have into the mind of the characters. It also helps justify a good bit of fan service; such is the mind of a teenage boy.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem that I could really complain about were the occasional inconsistencies across scenes; spelling mistakes, characters in strange positions, and minor bits of continuity strangeness that you might notice on the second or third watch-through.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a series that meant to mature and bloom as you understand it better, and in doing what it set out to do it is an absolute masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\n[Spoilers to follow]\\n\\n\r\n-- Story --\\n\\n\r\nAny discussion of SAO II must inevitable be prefaced with a discussion of SAO. This is a plot heavy sequel of a plot heavy anime, and it's simply not possible to understand the various character study arcs without some understanding of the message SAO was trying to deliver. At the core of SAO was the question of \"What is Reality?\" Eventually it arrived at the answer that your reality was what you made it, within balance and reason. In the process it followed the daily lives of a few perfectly normal people as they went through a dangerous world they could never have been prepared for. It let you see into the lives of two kids that suddenly had to fight for their lives, and mature long before they should have had to. Most of all, it did so in a perfectly believable way that any MMO player can easily relate to. \\n\\n\r\nSAO set the stage for SAO II by introducing the characters and the experiences that brought them together, and then gave way to SAO II to truly study what this meant for each of them. SAO asks, attempts to resolve the question of \"What is reality?\" Then SAO II picks up this theme by asking the only question that hopes to achieve the same scope and scale. This anime is a thematic study of the question \u201cWhat does it mean to live and to die?\\n\\n\r\nEverything in SAO II is questioning the meaning of life and death, particularly when it comes to this world that the characters have accepted as being equal to their own reality. Everything from the first arc, which blurs the line between death in the real world, and the virtual, to the last which offers a bittersweet glance at what it means to live life to the fullest. Even the middle arc offers an interesting perspective on how alive the world the characters inhabit really is, and how deep the attachment to this world runs in each of them. Weaving throughout all these themes, the series manages to include a heartfelt romance, a good look at various cultural idiosyncrasies of Japan, entertaining fight scenes, and a variety of worlds each totally different from the other.\\n\\n\r\n-- Characters --\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were probably the strongest point of the series, assuming that one took the time to really empathize with them. \\n\\n\r\nKirito is a normal teenage boy, with normal teenage interests. He\u2019s fascinated with VR technology, and has dreams of realizing his own ideas developed over years in this sort of game. Behind this mask you have a boy who was forced to become a soldier, and bear the burden of thousands. He\u2019s a person that wants to live his life in peace, but is willing to help those in need. He shows a deep attachment to the world that became his home; the world where he met his love. He acts like a person forged on the battlefield; when under pressure he takes charge, and when he is safer he understand the need to rest and plan. He actually shows traces of PTSD, with clear hints that he\u2019s spent quite a while dealing with these matters, either alone or with professional help. He\u2019s also a bit of a pervert, but what would anyone expect. The book makes it quite clear that he an Asuna share a rather intimate relationship. \\n\\n\r\nAlong with Kirito the first season introduces Sinon, who is a bit of a \"foil\" that the story uses to help compare and contrast with Kirito. Like him she had killed someone, but unlike him she never had the experience to deal with the result. Instead she built herself a nearly schizophrenic persona of a quiet sniper running with the rough and tumble gunmen of the world of GGO. As the first arc progresses we get to see as she slowly manages to put her trauma behind her, and recaptures the more friendly and outgoing persona that you might expect of a girl that age. She does fall off in importance once the first arc is over, being relegated to an minor role for the rest of the series. This makes sense when you consider that the Sinon is Kirito\u2019s friend, while the second major arc focuses on Asuna.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings us Asuna, arguably one of the most interesting characters in the series. While we are only treated to hints of her problems during the first half of the series, the second half does an amazing job of telling her story. Here we learn that Asuna is facing some serious challenges of her own. Despite her normally happy appearance we get to see that Asuna is troubled by her position in society. As the daughter of influential people she is faced with certain expectations that run counter to what she wants from her life. However, her upbringing, and the cultural gulf between her and her mother makes solving those problems quite difficult. Despite all of that she manages to put on a strong face for all of her friends, even when she finds out that the first female friend to truly understand her is a young girl in the terminal stages of AIDS. In this she acts as a pillar of stability for those around her, protecting her family above all else.\\n\\n\r\nYuuki is a mirror into Asuna\u2019s character in the same way that Sinon was a mirror of Kirito in the first Arc. Like Asuna, Yuuki strives to protect her friends in the face of insurmountable circumstances. She too puts on a mask of the happy, cheerful girl, even when her reality is a broken body constantly on the verge of death. She works hard, and does her best so that the technology which let her live the last of her days in happiness can help others. With her strength of will she even helps Asuna find the strengths to confront her mother, passes on a legacy that will live on in the VR world, and receives a true champion\u2019s farewell. \\n\\n\r\nThen, we have the \"harem.\" Despite what some chose to see, this is actually a fairly normal a group of friends who have formed a bond akin to family with this alternate world. These are people that lived, bled, killed, and faced sorrow with the main characters. Some of them have traces of an old crush on Kirito, though that is rarely played out beyond exasperated sighs as they watch Kirito and Asuna cuddle in the distance. Nevertheless, all of the members of this group are well fleshed out characters with interesting personalities and unexpected depth. For the most part these characters add a softer, often more comedic edge to the interaction. That\u2019s not too say that they lack serious moments, but unfortunately they simply cannot get the serious treatment that the main characters enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I cannot let the review go without bringing up Yui. The character that gets the most complaints for not being human enough, and for her role as a silly diversion. Ironically, Yui is the one that best exhibits what she was meant to; she is an AI, and behaves herself in a consistent fashion with the rules of the universe that we are introduced to. There are even hints to a deeply technical side of her that is very close to Kirito, and helps him in his day to day life. Unfortunately we rarely see her outside a tentative support role, though I believe there is a lot of potential there had the show dared to explore it further.\\n\\n\r\n-- Art & Sound --\\n\\n\r\nThere is little to say here. The both the artistic and audio direction were top notch. The studios selected were clearly picked for their ability to deliver a complete package, and I believe they managed to catch the mood and the theme of the series perfectly. The music was quite amazing and thematic, connecting well with the ideas of the show. It\u2019s truly difficult to match the melancholy feeling that the last ending theme evoked when you realize that the song was something shared by Asuna and Yuuki, as the last notes fade out over Yuuki\u2019s memorial. \\n\\n\r\nI will take some issues with the character animations, particularly during dialog. While the backgrounds are always utterly amazing, the characters are often too still, and too simple to really do justice to the backdrop. It\u2019s something that\u2019s fairly easy to forgive given the consistent style, and exciting battle scenes, but it still stands out at times. \\n\\n\r\n-- Enjoyment --\\n\\n\r\nIf you are willing to invest some time into this show, and truly dive into the world then it offers an experience few series can match. If you can relate to the experience of farming rare items for weeks on end, of gathering materials for a rare recipe, of spending weeks and months on a new boss, and of meeting friends that will last a lifetime through the screen of the game, this series will speak to you like no other. If you are willing to treat this series with the care and attention given to a book, then you will find an involving and captivating plot. If you can look beneath the surface you will find a deep world full of wonderful characters. Unfortunately if you are just looking for a normal anime experience to fill out your list then you might not even see a glimpse of any of the things I speak of. \\n\\n\r\n-- Overall \u2013\\n\\n\r\nThis series completes the package that is SAO. Even if we never see SAO III, I will hold it in my heart as one of the greats. \\n\\n\r\nI would be a fool to claim that this is a show for everyone. Clearly it will not appeal to every person that picks it up. However, I do not believe that this is a shortcoming of any sort. I simply do not see how it could have delivered such an experienced to a wider audience, at least in anime form. Maybe more people might understand it if read from the book, but that\u2019s not really here or there in an anime review. In short, when seen by the target audience, this show offers an experience that matches and even exceeds some of the very best masterpieces of the past decade. For that I give it 10/10, and to those that understand why I raise my glass. May we meet again, and share the stories of the worlds that we have seen.\\n",

            "content": "Mod Edit: this review may contain spoilers.\r\nSword Art Online... You know, I hear alot of fanboys say that the second season is much better than the first, but I say they're dead wrong. When I started watching this season, I told myself that I'm not taking anyone's word for it and will let the show speak for itself. If you ask me, Sword Art Online should've ended after, y'know, Sword Art Online. Even if Aincrad was a terrible arc, it would've ended with at least some dignity. But nope, Fairy Dance just had to drive whatever dignity it had into the ground.\r\nThe second season ofSword Art Online is split into three arcs: The first arc is Phantom Bullet (Episodes 1 through 14). One year after the SAO incident, there have been killings of players in real life in a game called Gun Gale Online by someone by the name of \"Death Gun\". Since it's been proven that it's no longer possible to kill someone through the game technology, Kazuto is brought in to log into GGO, and enter the Battle of Bullets tournament to get to the bottom of Death Gun.\\n\\n\r\nHow in the world did anyone say this arc was better than the first two arcs? If anything it's just as bad.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, no matter what anyone tries to say, Kirito is not smart, complex, or badass character. He's a Gary Stu, a wish-fulfillment blank slate meant for basement-dwelling loser teenage males to insert themselves onto and a walking example of the writer's complete and utter laziness. His GGO avatar looking female is absolutely stupid and completely pointless. I mean, I can understand the G.I.R.L. thing because I've done it once before, even though it's stated that it's more of an effeminate looking male appearance. But here's the thing: The show plays it up as if he is a female. I don't need to hear Kirito do a dumb girly voice. And even the process on HOW he gets that avatar is stupid. First of all, no MMO would ever give a player predetermined avatars. Secondly, out of all of them, Kirito just so happens to get one of the rarest ones.\\n\\n\r\nAnd let's talk about how he's the only one out of how many players to use a lightsaber. (Yeah, I'm calling it a lightsaber because that's exactly what it is. It even makes the same sounds effects.) And yet the show passes that off as \"if it can be bought, it can be used.\" But the deal is no one in GGO ever thought to use it. It's basically there waiting for Kirito alone to use it. In fact, the fact that no one but Kirito can, because he's Kirito, proves the writing is too lazy to make him learn anything. Yeah, fans say he's not a Gary Stu. Everything I've seen out of this show makes me think otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nNow Shino Asada/Sinon, the female lead of the Phantom Bullet arc. Her story is that, at the tender age of 11, she was traumatized by shooting a bank robber out of self-defense, and as a result, gained a phobia of guns and anything shaped like one, such as a gun hand gesture. So she plays GGO as a form of exposure therapy to help her fight her fear of guns.\\n\\n\r\nSo what happens to Sinon's character? Take a wild guess. Here's a hint: It's starts with \"K\" and ends with \"irito.\"\\n\\n\r\nGod, I can't stand her. I hate her as much as I do Asuna, and that's a big low considering Asuna's one of the show's worst characters. She started out as a decent character with a decent backstory, but then she turned into an useless crybaby whose only purpose is to shove her pancake butt to the audience. If you're gonna do that, A-1, at least give her a nice one. And it made me discover what's wrong with females in this show, and why they're only meant to inevitably become part of Kirito's harem. This is an rundown on how female characters are \"written\" here: \"Here's a potentially good character. I'll spend an episode or two showing you why you should like her. Now that she has your interest, watch as I completely toss out everything you liked about her and make her dependent on Kirito-kun while I laugh at your face, you goddamn idiot.\" It happened to Asuna, it happened to Suguha, and it happened to Sinon. Did you expect anything less? Like I said before, there is no point in liking any female character in this show, let alone Sinon, if they're just gonna get their character trampled on by Kirito.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yeah, I do understand how her idea of exposure therapy works. \"I've been traumatized by gun violence and by playing Online First-Person Shooters, where I'm surrounded by guns will help me cope with it in real life.\" Here's the problem with that: First, even if I can buy the exposure therapy idea, you don't relive into the very thing that caused the trauma. Second, the exposure therapy idea ultimately goes nowhere. Kirito does everything for her and she accomplishes nothing on her own. Likewise, they pretty much retconned Kirito's PTSD from SAO just so he can out-PTSD her to make her weak and useless. Her character becomes so dependent on Kirito that it's sickening. You'd think that Sinon, having experienced the same kinds of things Kirito had, would be the one to help Kirito cope and eventually they help each other cope with their respective fears. But since this is SAO, Sinon's only real worth is her pancake butt. Whatever dialogue she has with Kirito become awkward and pointless when she's essentially riding his D.\\n\\n\r\nAnd after all is said and done, Both Kirito and Sinon's PTSD magically disappears Heck, their PTSD turns on and off whenever the plot needs it to. If the writers actually knew a thing or two about how PTSD works, then they would've known that no matter how much therapy is taken, PTSD is stuck with you for the rest of your life and all it takes is the trigger to bring it back. I'll go into more detail about how this show and its writing has no respect for this stuff later in the review, but what Sinon really has here is a much different form of PTSD: Plot-Triggered Stupidity Disorder.\\n\\n\r\nNow the villain, Death Gun, or as I like to call him \"edgy Darth Vader knockoff\", and yes, he basically is. The dude is a walking Lucasfilms lawsuit waiting to happen. I mean, nothing's original, but SAO is so unoriginal that I feel it rips everything off. The guy does not feel threatening at all. He's basically evil for the sake of evil and his attempt at villainy falls flat.\\n\\n\r\nWe learn that Death Gun is made of at least three persons: Shouichi Shinkawa/Red-Eyed XaXa, his younger brother Kyouji/Spegiel, and his partner Atsushi Kanemoto/Johnny Black. XaXa is logged into GGO as Death Gun, while Kyouji or Johnny Black breaks into a victim's home and injects a lethal drug, while at the same time watching a livestream to perfectly time it so that it looks like Death Gun killed a person in-game. Kirito figures ALL of this out without any prior knowledge. He doesn't take random guesses; he is 100% on the mark. He can't log out during the GGO tournament (because the developers forgot how much of a safety hazard not being able to log out), and he's not in contact with anyone in the real world outside, so his figuring this out comes off as complete convenience.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to make matters worse, Kyouji being one part of Death Gun was made so blatantly obvious in the third episode that I was more concerned on what dumb motivation he had for killing. And even worse, we have him attempt to rape Shino. Yeah, because murder-suicide is already bad enough, we gotta pull the rape card. Because it worked SO well the last time. And even if Shino was able to fight off Kyouji for awhile, in the end, once again, it's Kazuto that bails her out. It's a problem when this show constatly uses attempted rape as cheap shock. It's also a problem when people actually and seriously attempt to defend such idiotic, offensive, and effortless excuse of writing, which, if you ask me, only makes them just as bad since they allow this garbage to get away with murder. If this had only happened in Fairy Dance, then I would've thought nothing of it outside that particular moment. But nope! Now that SAO has trivialized sexual assault on two consecutive occasions, I have every reason to assume that any subsequent villains will eventually attempt to rape a girl at some point in their time, because we gotta follow the \"all bad guys are rapists\" cliche so that big, strong hero Kirito can save the girl. Like I said before, ff you can't write attempted rape without any real meaning or purpose other than \"all bad guys are rapists\", then don't do it.\\n\\n\r\nWanna know why SAO does these things and gets away with it? Because you allow it to. Yes, you do.\\n\\n\r\nThis entire arc runs on the characters being dumb as a brick and plot convenience. And there are two grating examples: First, we learn that Death Gun is an SAO survivor, just like Kirito, only he was a Player-Killer. However, despite knowing where he came from, Kirito doesn't know who because when Death Gun was about to tell him his name, Kirito basically ignored him because he never thought he would see him again. Nothing works even on a basic level, because it feels like not a single piece of thought or logic was put into it.\\n\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, I tried to give this arc a fair chance, despite the fans saying it's the best one (and I never listen to the fans anyway, because I found this arc utter trash), but every single time it convinces me why I should never give Sword Art Online any chances at all. Because when you let your guard down for even one second, it drops to the bottom of the barrel. Honestly, this arc is only better than the last arc because it had none of that incest crap. Other than that, it's the same ol' trash I've come to expect from one of the biggest piles of garbage to plague anime in recent years.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc, titled Calibur, takes up Episodes 15 through 17. It follows Kirito and his harem and Klein going on a sidequest in ALO to find the Holy Sword Excalibur.\\n\\n\r\nWhat was even the point of this arc? No, seriously, what? Nothing. There was no point to it. It was basically the equivalent to filler. It's not like anything in the Calibur arc matters in the long run. Heck, nothing after Episode 14 matters honestly. It's like the writers just ran out of ideas and instead just show Kirito being awesome so the viewer can throw your money at the screen.\"It takes an idiot to do cool things. That's why it's cool.\" Honestly, that's Kirito in a nutshell: An idiot who does cool things, and you love it because Kirito is supposed to be you. That's you doing the cool things, and that's you being an idiot. Like I said before, blank slates like Kirito are not good characters. They're meant to be a medium of wish fulfillment and power fantasties, so that you can project yourself onto him, and his personality is what you make for him.\\n\\n\r\nThe only things really worth complaining about in this arc is Sinon, because like Asuna, her extstence is a complete sin to the entire series as a whole, and is only there because catgirl and contribute next to nothing. Also, Kirito's personality shifts between arcs, in which he goes from a shell-shocked warrior to a complete asshole. Even if you can say there's nothing at stake here, him being a jerk to his friends for no reason is really stupid. But it's okay because he's the main character, so no one will bat an eye about him yanking Sinon's tail or kicking Klein in the face.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I'd much rather take boring filler over the two arcs before that... and the next one.\\n\\n\r\nThe third and final arc of Season 2, titled Mother's Rosario, takes up Episodes 18 through 24, and while most fans say it's probably one of the best arcs, I disagree. I think it's up there with Fairy Dance as the worst of SAO as a whole, mainly because it promises a probability of SAO actually being somewhat decent only to do a complete 180 and show how low it will go to manipulate the viewer while at the same time laughing at the face for anyone who fell for its trickery. Mother's Rosario is SAO's biggest slap to the audience's faces. Remember when I said I should never give Sword Art Online any chances at all, because when you let your guard down for even one second, it drops to the bottom of the barrel? Well, this arc is the reason why I'm going to hold to that statement for the remainder of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIn this arc, Asuna takes center stage. Kirito has a small presence but enough to offer up some plot convenience in the arc, which is a good thing because Heaven forbid we keep making him the one and only star of the show, stealing everybody else's spotlight. She is recruited by Yuuki Konno/Zekken into her guild, the Sleeping Knights. Their goal is to defeat a Floor Boss with only seven players before they have to disband.\\n\\n\r\nLet me just say this: A character whose only goal in life is being Kirito-kun's waifu (which she said in the beginning of the season) is not even a character, let alone a strong one. And guess what? Asuna's character doesn't change beyond being Kirito-kun's waifu. Maybe she might have changed, but in the end, she reverts back to the way she started. Her story is basically dealing with her mother who wants to set Asuna's future. Which is understandable, because children at Asuna's age at this point (18, I believe) are nearing adulthood and have to start planning for their future. On one side, she's right about setting Asuna on the right path, because spending time online with friends won't get you anywhere in life. But on the other side, she's wrong for forcing it all onto Asuna without her say in the matter, which included, if you recall, marrying her off to a middle-aged businessman who kept her comatose and sexually assaulted her.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem here is that Asuna doesn't confront these problems head-on. She runs away from them. Whenever her mother calls her out on her spending time online with friends and Kirito, Asuna's first instinct is to walk away and attempt to escape from her harsh reality by running into Kirito's arms. Because she feels at home online with Kirito rather than with her own family in real life. I don't mind escapism so long as it's doesn't try to avoid and/or ignore the characters' issues in reality, which is what SAO does. Secondly, her running away the issue proves how childish and weak Asuna is. The show uses video games skills in place of character strengths, but in reality, these so-called strengths are artificial at most. Eventually, Asuna does decide to own up to her mother (albeit not on her own accord) and manages to reach a middle ground with her mother, but it mainly results in Asuna's mother being portrayed in the 100% wrong, and Asuna herself learns nothing. She still is Kirito-kun's waifu, a character whose ambitions and accomplishments are not her own.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Yuuki Konno: She may very well be considered the closest thing SAO will get to an actually likable female character. I know I say that there is nothing likable about any single female character, but compared to Asuna, Suguha, Sinon, and every other one, being a likable female character in SAO is an extremely low standard, and Yuuki took very little effort to surpass it. She is essentially the opposite of every female in SAO: She doesn't fall in love with Kirito, she doesn't become dependant on him at all, she doesn't end up in his harem, and she actually defeats Kirito in a PvP battle, which is a big achievement since Kirito only loses a fight due to some technicality. One might think that Yuuki's too good of a character for a pile of garbage like SAO.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, I thought the Mother's Rosario arc was surprisingly not half bad. I mean the past few arcs were utterly terrible, and because of the irreparable damage it has done to itself, I couldn't be optimistic that this arc will change my overall opinion of it. Again, the same issues that have been seen in most arcs are still present: The biggest one is Kirito himself. The guy is so Gary Stu that all the flashy sword swings and deflecting magic and what have you, everything he does is all show just to make him look awesome, but it makes me lose interest quickly. It's other biggest problem is its ability to handle emotional drama. Sure, Zekken and the Sleeping Kights are a fresh change of pace from Gary Stu and his harem of waifus, but there's some sense of turmoil from not only the fact that the team has to disband, but from something personal from Zekken herself. The problem is I cannot get invested in these characters alot because they never make their issues known to anyone, and the show is trying (and failing) to make me do so. I actually began to believe that Mother's Rosario is the arc that Sword Art Online should've been, which made me feel that all the previous arcs' past stupidity weren't worth reaching this point...\\n\\n\r\nOr so I thought before a certain point near the end.\\n\\n\r\nAs it turns out, Yuuki is terminally ill, and not just with any fictional illness. She has Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. AIDS. Not HIV, but full-blown AIDS. In 2011, her mom gave birth to Yuuki and her twin sister via C-section, which caused her to lose a severe amount of blood. The doctors then gave her HIV-infected blood that no one in the hospital knew it was infected until after the transfusion. Eventually, the virus spread across her family and they all died from it, and she's the next to go.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, FUCK YOU! Fuck you, Sword Art Online. There isn't a violin small enough for how sappy and goddamn stupid this is. This is the reason why I will always hate this garbage with every fiber of my being for as long as I live. Because it somehow manages to show itself it can be decent every so often only to jump back to the bottom of the barrel and make me look like a fool for getting my hopes up for nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that Yuuki has AIDS isn't the problem here. It's how she (and her family) got the AIDS, how it's handled here, and how it's only used as a substitute for character development. It's done in the most unrealistic way possible and makes you wonder if either the writers made the hospital staff incompetent on purpose so that this can happen, or they didn't even bother to do the research. I'm no medical expert, but I know enough that hospitals do check blood for any signs of infections before giving it to people. The technology to detect infections in blood exist, even in 2011. Heck, if the blood is infected, it wouldn't even be in the hospital. I'm not gonna ask myself why the Konno family didn't sue the pants off this hospital for medical malpractice because I'd be doing the writer's job. And let's be honest, anyone with a shred of common sense can do a better job at writing SAO than whatever you call this piss-poor excuse of writing. Heck, Captain Planet handled AIDS better, even though that was ridiculously overblown on a comical scale. AIDS is a disease that is usually contracted and spread through bodily fluids. It would be understandable for her dad to get it from her mom, but what about her older twin sister, born mere moments BEFORE Yuuki? How did she get the virus? There's no way. Not one single aspect about this story works, not even on a logical standpoint. There's no excuse for this. No amount of medical research can handwave or excuse, let alone justify what is irresponsible handling of a real-life terminal illness for the sake of artificial feels. This whole \"we didn't know the blood was infected until later\" story is a middle finger to medical science and to the audience's intelligence, and I'm just gonna give it one right back.\\n\\n\r\nThe Mother's Rosario arc is not some \"heartbreaking, beautiful, powerfully human tale\". It's nothing but a cheap sob story done in the most underhanded, manipulative, unrealistic, and overblown way imaginable. I like Yuuki, I really do; but I'm not going to say her character was developed that much, because she wasn't. Yeah, she's isn't as one-dimensional as all the other characters, but I felt more saddened that she had to be subject to how full of shit this show is, reduced into a vessel for ill-gotten sympathy. You have to let the audience feel the emotion for themselves. Forcing them to by giving a character Super AIDS is basically making your audience look like dumbasses. The one time I thought SAO might have a decent character and she's ruined by the worst possible idiotic melodrama because the writer still has his head too far up his own asshole. Why did I expect anything less? Considering that Kawahara once said that he's incapable of writing female characters that don't fall for Kirito (yeah, he did say that), I can't help but wonder if he decided to screw over Yuuki this way as punishment for not being like every other female character in SAO. Why even do this? Was it because Yuuki didn't become a part of Kirito's harem so Kawahara decided to off her with Super AIDS? I bet it was! Ultimately, the Mother's Rosario arc reflects SAO as a whole: A piece of garbage that takes a big steamy dump on whatever it pleases. Out of all the stupid moments SAO has done between its two seasons, this is the ultimate final nail in a coffin full of final nails. I'm not made of stone, but when shows try to manipulate the viewer into feeling sad, it's basically asking me to hate it.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a recurring problem with SAO as a whole, arguably its biggest one and the one that has brought the entire season down. The writers has an insistence on handlng heavy subjects such as sexual assault, post-traumatic stress, terminal illnesses, and what have you, and every time they try, it only shows how immature the writing is as they end up being used as a plot device and done in a completely unrealistic way. If anything, the way such issues are portrayed here could be construed as disrespectful to those who has experienced it themselves. When it comes to things like this, either do it in a respectful manner or don't do it at all; there is no middle ground about it. These kinds of things have absolutely no business being here if it's not going to be handled in the right manner.\\n\\n\r\nContrary to what some may say, Season 2 of Sword Art Online is in no way any better than the first season.  Actually, it's WORSE than the previous season. At least the first season started out good before descending into garbage. This season was hot garbage on a plate from start to finish. At this point, even the most minuscule shred of sympathy I had for SAO and its toxic fanbase is as good as dead. It's nothing but a dumpster fire that can ONLY get worse. Something that has learned from none of its mistakes, which should've made evident when it trivialized sexual asault for the second time in a row. needs to be thrown into the garbage, where it belongs.\\n\\n\r\nOnce a pile of garbage, always a pile of garbage.",

            "content": "Ok. So there's a lot of reviews for this out there so mine's going to be a little different. Bear with me guys. Bear. With. Me.\r\nOne. Two. Three Four Five\r\nEverybody grab a gun and c'mon lets ride...\r\nYep. That Mambo N.5 appropriation pretty much sums up the first arc of SAO II. The only problem is the people driving seem to even more geographically challenged than me, and as the anime's seemingly directionless take becomes apparent you'll find yourself yelling 'For fuck sake use a GPS'. Yep. This anime has trouble navigating itself.\r\nBut smash on the beaks and hop on out. Lets step back, shall we,and look at the bigger picture. Coming as a sequel to the original SAO I'd pull the words 'hype' and 'expectations' from my metaphorical hat. Whilst both were there the hype seemed to remain for far longer than my expectations - which were quickly smashed into the ground. Ouch!\\n\\n\r\nThe sequel seemed to serve to accentuate the flaws of the original and downplay any strengths it had. Plot inconsistencies rose to new heights as what was seemingly at stake trudged lower than ever. Fanservice made an appearance at awkward moments and some of the motives behind peoples actions made as much sense as a giraffe eating a dinosaur. What? You say. What indeed.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, it's not all bad! Open those eyes and ears! The animation and sound were done well, and whilst I wasn't fond of characterisation and development early it did get a little better towards the end. SAO II is also a little special in that it has a unique charm to it, where you know it's bad but somewhat enjoy it anyway. That being said I did find myself getting bored at moments and looking at the ceiling (oh how plain white ceilings entertain me).\\n\\n\r\nWe don't want to be here forever, so lets sum up! This anime is a polariser. It has a lot of flaws and a couple of strengths. You might like it, you might not. The problems that exist in this anime are very in your face (similar to a non-scary ghost popping out in a haunted house). You can't miss it. The question is, how much does it bother you? \\n\\n\r\nIt broke my 10 pairs of rose-tinted glasses in the first few episodes. How many pairs do you have?",

            "content": "\u2018Right here, I can\u2019t tell you what I\u2019m thinking and what I feel. I want you to see my world!\u2019\r\nSAO was a one trick pony. Its death game premise burdened the already heavy task of climbing Castle Aincrad\u2019s 100 floors. But the illusion of the unconquerable castle would often break, as the anime proper would skip floors at the story\u2019s convenience. Halfway through, the show lost the sense of scale it needed to cover for what the characters lacked. In many ways, we saw their world, but not their feelings. SAO was a lukewarm experience.\r\nWhich makes me proud to say SAO II is actually quitegood.\\n\\n\r\nA year after the SAO incident, Kirito is assigned to investigate a series of real life deaths linked to the videogame Gun Gale Online, or GGO. By playing GGO, Kirito hopes to directly contact the prime suspect, Death Gun, and discover the truth behind these deaths. Let it be said now that, much like SAO, SAO II is more of an alternate world fantasy than a reflection of videogames. There are inconsistencies in the game mechanics abound that would make videogame purists cringe. Then again, if you\u2019ve seen the first season, there\u2019s nothing here you haven\u2019t seen before.\\n\\n\r\nExcept for the things we haven\u2019t seen before. It\u2019s a lot, and it\u2019s mostly for the better. The pacing is now steady and believable, instead of skipping multiple events at a time or spending a lot of time on one event. In turn, Death Gun\u2019s dominating presence in the GGO storyline is unmitigated, while the Mother\u2019s Rosario story arc is steeped in nostalgia. Unfortunately, the three episode mini saga of Excalibur is little more than SAO II\u2019s last love letter to its harem fans without care for telling a good story. But the crack left by the Sword in the Stone is barely a dent to its characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s a good thing too, because what SAO II lacks in scale more than makes up for in its characters. Kirito especially has improved a lot. Gone are the days where his only real challenges were ones where strength alone wasn\u2019t enough. Now he\u2019s both \u2018mentally\u2019 examined and physically tested, especially during GGO. He is a much more rounded character for it, but unfortunately this character arc doesn\u2019t go the extra mile. The source of his inner anguish also feels like a rewrite of SAO.\\n\\n\r\nCo starring with Kirito in GGO is Sinon. Her quiet casualness in real life masks a silent strength in the game, but there\u2019s no moment where her real self and game self clash to make her feel like a different character. It\u2019s two identities created by a single incident in her past, with the events of GGO bleeding them together and forcing her to confront her fears. It is a slow burning, punishing journey that thankfully does not fully solve her problems even at the end. The story recognizes how weakness needs to be overcome one small step at a time, and the time with Sinon is time well spent.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Sinon\u2019s development isn\u2019t the only thing SAO II likes to show off. To be sure, the fight scenes and music are still as slick as they ever were (I freaking love Tomatsu Haruka\u2019s \u2018Courage\u2019), while the GGO setting is lively and distinct despite the brown and grey everywhere. From the shrub forest encroaching the river to the mesh of an abandoned metropolis and old west town, SAO II is the envy of first person shooter games everywhere. It\u2019s just too bad the visuals also show off Sinon\u2019s backside a bit too much. Which is odd, because the last story arc, Mother\u2019s Rosario, doesn\u2019t have anything like this.\\n\\n\r\nWell, whatever.\\n\\n\r\nIf the Alfheim story is what took away Asuna\u2019s integrity from the Aincrad arc, Mother\u2019s Rosario puts this woman back in form with a vengeance. She\u2019s faced with the reality of what two years lost means in real life, while forging the friendship of a lifetime with someone in the game world. Asuna doesn\u2019t develop in this story in the traditional sense, but she doesn\u2019t need to. She\u2019s smart enough to know why some people are acting the way they do with her, while her congeniality was always a part of her. What Asuna needed were characters to bounce off of, and the Mother\u2019s Rosario provides just that.\\n\\n\r\nIn particular are the two characters this story introduces. One is estranged to Asuna to play the role of antagonist but never a villain. She is frighteningly believable in what she says, and could definitely hit close to home for a lot of viewers. The other character is one half of the most believable relationship in the entire series. The development between them is silly, sweet, smooth, and not once does the feeling between Asuna and this new character ever feel romantic. Their relationship flawlessly glides across the tightrope called \u2018intimately platonic\u2019 that\u2019s so easy to fall off from.\\n\\n\r\nTalk about refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of all the surface improvements from SAO, SAO II is thematically unified without being heavy handed. From Sinon\u2019s reason for playing GGO, to Death Gun\u2019s motive for terrorizing others, to another\u2019s gung-ho liveliness in the game, SAO II is more about the power of online identity than an alternate world fantasy adventure. For better or worse, people change who they are or show their true colors online. And SAO II builds this naturally to the point where the show never loses its narrative breath.\\n\\n\r\nThe mark of a good story is it won\u2019t build itself around a theme, but that the theme builds itself around the story. For SAO II to understand this despite having blundered so much in its first season on top of its own improvements, honestly makes me wonder: is this seriously the same series that left me so conflicted? THIS is SAO?\\n\\n\r\nAnd then I looked again.\\n\\n\r\nThis is SAO II.",

            "content": "Like most of the community, I was watching Sword Art Online whilst it was airing about four or five years ago, and I remember how everyone collectively became more and more disappointed with the show as it was airing. Not only was the show's pacing completely out of control with constant time skips amongst many other glaring issues during the first half, the show practically imploded in on itself during the horrendous second arc, which only left nothing but a bad taste in my mouth. At the time, I hated the show, and still do to a certain extent now, but my main thought wasthat, at the very least, Sword Art Online couldn't get any worse... right? Unfortunately, I was proven wrong since the second season of Sword Art Online proved to be even worse, becoming one of the worst anime I have ever had the displeasure of consuming in my entire life. While there are perhaps one or two elements of the show that is worthy of praise, the negatives far outweigh the positives and this review will be tackling all three arcs in order while practically spoiling every event in the show, so take that as a warning if you're planning to watch this anime at some point. With all of that out of the way, let's jump into the Phantom Bullet arc!\\n\\n\r\nPHANTOM BULLET ARC (1/10):\\n\\n\r\nThis arc is one of the worst story arcs I have ever seen. What could have been an interesting look into the mental state and psyche of Kirito, just becomes an aimless mess with no sense of direction, followed by glaring pacing issues and awful characters as well as a terrible villain. This arc does so much wrong that's insanely annoying to watch and I constantly wanted to consume cyanide during my viewing to taste the sweet, sweet relief of death. The second season of SAO takes place a year after the events of the first season and opens up with Kirito and Asuna on a date, happily reminiscing about their time in Sword Art Online. Y'know... that place where thousands of people met their horrible demise? Perhaps they view the entire experience as some sort of romantic honeymoon or something. Anyway, whilst on this date, Kirito is asked by some government dude if he could speak to him about some strange incidences involving the massively popular game known as \"Gun Gale Online\". Government-kun tells Kirito-sama that in this game, a player has been able to successively kill other plays in the game, resulting in their real-life deaths. The viewer learns of this player, called \"Death Gun\" from the opening scene of the show. Not only is the character design a lesser version of Darth Vader, but the name \"Death Gun\" just seems silly and stupid. A gun's primary use is that of a weapon; to kill people and bring about death. So, I guess the gun is double the death then...? I guess it does make sense in the context of the show since this \"double death gun\" does result in the avatar and the real-life death of the person controlling said avatar, but the name does seem a little silly for someone trying to be so intimidating and feels more like a cheap knock off, of the Death Note than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Government-kun asks Kirito-sama if he will work with him by going inside Gun Gale Online to try and put a stop to Death Gun, and, after some reluctance at first, Kirito agrees and the rest of the arc sees Kirito attempting to find out Death Gun's true identity. Now, this sounds fine on paper, but the execution for this arc is terrible. First of all, let's discuss Kirito's character and the HUGE waste in potential this anime throws out the window in regards to his PTSD. At some point in the show, while Kirito is about to enter a tournament in the game (I'll get to the specifics of this in a bit) we learn that Death Gun was a part of a group called \"Laughing Coffin\" in Sword Art Online; a group that Kirito and Asuna fought and was forced to kill some of their members. This triggers Kirito's PTSD and this is easily one of the most interesting things that have ever happened to his character since he actually exhibits symptoms of actually being a real, genuine person for once; it helps his character feel more grounded and relatable than simply being a generic self-insert. Kirito's psychological stress and hang-ups in regards to actually killing someone and having this link into the main villain was a smart idea and could have allowed for so much development and understanding of his character and just really how much damage SAO had done to his mental well being. This COULD have been the case if the show expanded on it at all. Kirito's physiological hang-ups barely last for even one episode, which means that his character hardly develops as a person and, instead, is completely absolved of his stress and worries after only a five-minute talk with some nurse at a hospital! They throw out the only interesting thing that has ever happened to this character in only one episode! After this, Kirito just devolves back into the boring, self-insert that he is and his character ceases to ever be interesting ever again. The fact that the show throws out its only redeeming quality is just a flick in the nuts to the audience and, again, is such wasted potential. The show should have started with Kirito waking up in bed or something, after having a dream about the time in which he killed someone in SAO, which would imply that Kirito has been suffering from his PTSD for a while now, as the rest of the show sees him come to terms with what he has done in the past and slowly learn to accept it and move on with his life. It could have made for a fantastic character study, but is just thrown to the side like a child with a toy.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of wasted potential, this also brings me to the other main character of this arc, Shion. Shion does have a bit more in the way of investment and drive in this narrative but is just as poorly handled like every other element in the show. As a child, Shion was caught up in a post office robbery, in which she manages to get the gun of the robber and shoot him, effectively killing him and saving the lives of everyone in the post office. This, however, has given her a severe phobia of guns, to the point where she throws up at the very sight of them. In order to overcome her phobia, she plays Gun Gale Online, a game all about battling it out with guns in an attempt to overcome her fear of them and she believes that, by winning the Bullet of Bullets tournament (the same one as Kirito enters) , she will be finally strong enough to overcome her fear and move on with her life. Her motivation in this narrative is not so bad but it lacks intrigue. Shion, herself, is a boring character since her characterisation is minimal and I always found it hard to connect to her or care for her struggles or goal. She consistently repeats some of the corniest and irritating lines in the entire show, most prominently during a fight in the second episode where she proclaims that another player is \"strong enough to smile on the battlefield\". The entire show is filled with these corny lines, and I understand that, to this character, the game is a huge deal in overcoming her ordeal but it feels like the show is trying to force drama and narrative stakes with cheesy, hyperbolic lines; it feels superficial and clunky. Shion's character is effectively ruined once she meets big strong Kirito who saves her at every hurdle and sorts out every problem for her. Like every other girl in this series, Shion does begin to feel feelings towards Kirito and she simply becomes just another boring, uninteresting love interest. Her character feels lazily thrown together, with all of the typical Tsundere traits you'd expect. She slaps Kirito after seeing her in minimal clothing (despite it being a video game), she has an apprehensive personality and her character is as inconsistent as a corrupt politician's views. The main problem I have with her character is how quickly the show is willing to let her become the damsel in distress who needs Kirito to save her when it should be the other way around. Shion should have been a side character Kirito meets inside the game, who helps Kirito work out his own mental hang-ups, but instead, she is used for pandering to the Otakus and all the teenagers who see Mr Kirito Mclovin as a self-insert for themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThe Villain, Death Gun, is just as bad as these two characters, if not worse in many regards. Myself and many others were able to figure out the identity of who Death Gun really was only after the first episode. Once I saw the opening, I pretty much figured it out since A-1 Pictures doesn't understand subtleties in the slightest. Whilst watching the opening, we see a shot of Shion's friend, Shinkawa, reach out his hand to her while she is on a swing. As he does so, the screen explodes into flames with Death Gun riding on a horse. This visual queue was more than enough for me to understand and suspect that he was Death Gun, which later proved to be correct, but even without this blunder, it is painfully easy to get since Shinkawa seems too nice to be true to Shion and the hints they drop are not exactly subtle. Not only that, but the way the author wrote the way around how Death Gun kills people is needlessly convoluted and stupid. It turns out that Death Gun was working as part of a three-man team, and one person out of this team would go the player's house in the real world, with a lethal injection, ready to inject the person with this stuff, once Death Gun's bullet connects with said person in the game. This would mean that the person at the house would have to be watching a live stream of the tournament, waiting until the bullet connects in order to inject the person. There is so much goddamn wrong with this. For starters, there was no need for such an overly complicated scenario since we already know that this is a fantasy world in which anything is possible. Why couldn't Death Gun kill someone in the game without resorting to this overly complicated and frankly, messy, idea? Not only that, but what happens when the person ready to inject the medicine believes that the bullet connected but it didn't really? What happens if the player is hit but he doesn't see it? This is so stupid it hurts...\\n\\n\r\nAnother huge problem is the lack of tension in this arc. Kirito, as usual, is a damn God who can do anything the plot demands from him, just because he is Kirito. One of the things I was most looking forward to in this arc was the fact that Kirito was playing a gun game, a weapon he was not accustomed to and he would have had to learn how to properly yield one and adapt to this world. Much like how the audience wouldn't know anything about this game, Kirito wouldn't either and we could grow attached to this character, seeing him learn the rules and get better the more he played. It would have created, y'know... NARRATIVE TENSION AND STAKES! But, no, Kirito finds a light saber, and thus is now unstoppable since we already know he can use a sword with no trouble whatsoever. Not only that, but despite this game being for hardcore players, Kirito pretty much destroys every single one of them instantly, learns how to use the very hard to control buggies straight away and pretty much deduces the entire plot for the audience through very long and drawn out monologues and exposition scenes. And holy hell is the exposition for this arc terrible! There are so many cafe exposition scenes in this show that it is insane and all of them just essentially tell the audience directly about the plot or how the characters are feeling. Setting exposition scenes in cafes is one of the laziest and boring ways to push a story forward and there are so many scenes like this that I almost fell asleep on many occasions. It's visually boring and only serves to pad out time, and the pacing for this arc is also pretty bad. Stretching out the source material into such a length was a bad idea since it leads to many scenes feeling as if they're dragging on for far too long. Take for example the episodes where Kirito and Shion are taking refuge inside a cave during the Bullet of Bullets tournament. We spend nearly two whole episodes in this god damn cave as we see both characters explain their predicaments and back stories to one another in slow and dull ways. We don't learn anything about the characters nor do we see them grow either, only in that Shion wants Kirito's dick a little more as a result. It's incredibly boring to watch since they just explain their backstories once again to the audience, which, at this point, only serves to pad out the arc and episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe game of Gun Gale Online itself feels so badly done and I imagine that, if this game were real, nobody would be playing this damn game! I have a lot more respect for a show that goes the extra mile to make their world believable but here, the game mechanics that the author thought of to put in the game feel so stupid. For starters, we are told that Gun Gale Online is the only game that has professional, hardcore players which is just a ridiculous notion since I can think of plenty of games off the top of my head that already have pro players, but the customisation option presented in the game is stupid too. We learn that in this game the player has no control over their avatar and it is randomly selected for you! Why on Earth is this a thing? In games, developers are constantly trying to expand on customisation, and the fact that Gun Gale Online locks you into only one playable class only adds to the fact that this game is broken! Moreover, if the avatars are randomly selected for you, then why the hell does Shion look like herself just with blue hair as well as Kirito, only now with longer hair and his character model is that of a female, while other avatars look nothing like their real-life owners? You may call these pedantic things to complain about, and perhaps they are, but when the show is this boring and dull, my mind wonders over to such things since I am not immersed in anything that is happening. \\n\\n\r\nEven the animation wasn't that stellar with frequent use of recap footage and many of the scenes set inside cafes with two characters simply taking. Even the final fight between Kirito and Death Gun is incredibly dull and anti-climatic to boot. This arc is just SO bad on every level from the insanely bad writing, to the stupid as hell plot, to the wasted potential and characters. Everything about the Phantom Bullet arc is awful and I still have even more things to complain and talk about, but I'm getting way ahead of myself. I still have two more arcs to go!\\n\\n\r\nCALIBUR ARC (4/10):\\n\\n\r\nI actually don't have too much to say with this arc since it is rather simple. After Gun Gale Online had finished airing its episodes, many people were tired out from the experience, and for many fans of the series, this was the arc that brought them back to enjoying SAO once again. This arc is a lot more simple in its complexity and is essentially about Kirito and his harem, dicking around in Alfheim Online. Essentially, Kirito and friends hear news of the legendary item, Calibur, has been found and set off on a mission to get this item, along with newcomer to the harem, Shion, who is now put on pause forever and is now part of Kirito's harem bitches. It's an arc that fans of the series will enjoy since it is mostly just comedic hi-jinks and while I did find some of the jokes funny, mostly regarding Klien, I found the arc to be pretty boring since I don't have a modicum of interest for any of these characters at all. It's not a bad arc, but an incredibly boring one for those who, like me, do not like these characters.\\n\\n\r\nMOTHER'S ROSARIO ARC (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nNow, I believe it is time to give some credit where I believe credit is due. This arc is actually not terrible and manages to do quite a lot that actually managed to impress me while handing a character death in a mature and even quite sad way too. This arc focuses more so on Asuna as the main character which I was happy for considering that Asuna is the only character that has anything going for her and luckily her character is not completely ruined and gets some small development. This arc focuses mainly on a girl called Yuki, who is a fantastic player in the game of Alfheim Online, who actually manages to beat Kirito in a fight! Can you believe it?! Anyway, we learn that this character actually has aids and is close to her death, but what is great is that this death and character is actually handled with a lot of care and heart. Yuki's character is simply not there just so that she can be used as a cheap plot device to evoke tears and drama into the story, but actually develops nicely over the course of this story arc into a respectable character, and, while I didn't cry at her death, the show was successful enough to evoke sadness in such a cynical cunt such as myself. \\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to feel emphatic towards Yuki's character since she is very lovable and easy to care about. She feels like a real kid going through such a horrible ordeal and her final moments were surprisingly well done. The arc isn't great, however, since the pacing, again, is pretty bad and the newly introduced characters, other than Yuki, don't get much attention and are pushed to the sides, but overall, this arc was a massive improvement. Not only that, but the animation quality and fight choreography are a bit better than that of Gun Gale Online and the arc has a killer opening too. There is much to like about this arc but it ultimately doesn't absolve all of the crap that Gun Gale Online put me through either. \\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, SAO II is a mess. It has frequent tonal shifts, the narrative is terrible with glaring plot holes and other glaring writing issues and even the few things that are worthy of praise, are not enough to raise the bar or change my stance on this show. I know that recently, it has become very trendy and hip to hate on SAO, and while I don't think this show is the worst anime ever made, it certainly is far from good, and every aspect of the show is so lazily produced and boring.",

            "content": "When I heard SAO was getting a second season, I was excited. Yes, SAO is one of my favorite animes, but I try not to let that cloud my judgement for how I would score it. \r\nStory: 6\r\nAs you can read in the series description, a player of a shooter VRMMO is killing people in the game. This is the first arc (Phantom Bullet). Kirito gets sent into the game because he's apparently the closest thing to a professional gamer at the disposal of the company trying to solve the mystery of how the player is killing people. Sinon is a sniper in that samegame and she's trying to overcome some trauma from her past by 'becoming strong' in the game. It felt a bit drawn out at times, but it still kept me interested as I waited to see how the arc would end.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc (Caliber) is more of a filler arc than anything. Kirito and his harem go on a quest to get excalibur in ALO that takes three episodes. It was a fun little adventure, but it didn't expand the characters in any way, and the overall quest itself was a bit of an odd draw on Norse mythos.\\n\\n\r\nThe third arc (Mother's Rosario) involves Asuna taking the role of MC and going on an adventure with a new group of characters, namely Yuuki, to try and clear a New Aincrad floor before anyone else. It was a lot of fun to watch, with plenty of sword art sword play and the new group, the Sleeping Knights guild, had a secret that made me care a bit about them (I think I cared about the Sleeping Knights more than I cared about the majority of Kirito's harem).\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 9\\n\r\nThe main things I love about SAO return in its second season. The music sounds fantastic and the art is amazing. Not much more needs to be said there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nThe usual shortcoming of SAO is its characters, and its second season isn't really an exception. The third arc has Asuna trying to face her own weakness in the real world compared to her strength in VRMMOs, but it's kind of a side-note to the story. Most of the attempts at character development are seen in the first arc. Kirito finally starts to deal with the trauma that comes with the fact that he killed people in Sword Art Online, but that's about it for his character. Sinon, the other MC for the first arc, is given more depth as she tries to come to terms with her own past. However, her interesting character is practically dismissed in order to turn her into the missing tsundere component of Kirito's harem, which was rather disappointing to see. She was a strong character who was reduced to a mess when her trauma followed her into the game, leading her to completely rely on Kirito in the most tsundere ways she could.\\n\\n\r\nI wasn't really a fan of how much of a prodigy Kirito became out of nowhere in this season. Hacking SAO itself back in season one to save Yui wasn't enough to prove his technology prowess; he now makes little cameras that make it so game characters can see the real world without any difficulty whatsoever. The only explanation given to his mechanical genius is that he has been on the internet.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nEven though I was REALLY disappointed to see Sinon merge into Kirito's harem without a second thought, it was still a fun season to watch. The art and sound still kept the scenes alive for me and I managed to forgive the shortcomings in the characters and story just because I was still having fun. It may have been ridiculous, but it was fun watching Kirito basically turn into a jedi to deflect bullets in a shooter game.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nIt's still SAO. Kirito has his harem and still cares for Asuna. Sinon unfortunately becomes a part of the harem, but had a good char before that. Art and Sound still carry the show past its shortcomings for me.\\n\\n",

            "content": "*Review contains minor spoilers of Sword Art:Online and Log Horizon too*\r\n I have seen thousands of people who compare Log Horizon with Sword Art:Online and how much it is better from SAO and most of them people are from here only. Don't get me wrong as a gamer person myself, I like both series. My review covers up 2 anime of same genre!\r\nStory- Overall, the Plot is totally messed up all the 5 arcs (SAO,ELF,GGO,Excalibur,Mother's Rosario), even though the very first SAO arc of the first season is still slightly better than the rest.To sum up this is the order SAO>Mother's Rosario>GGO>Excalibur>>>ELF. But, I don'tsee how Log Horizon is any better? \\n\\n\r\n-The story development is just too slow to the point I find myself sleeping. At least SAO series have pump up action/fighting scenes and romance which is a + point for me. Yes, I agree Log Horizon has romance too, but it is still one sided. The main drawback of both these series is actually the story's atmosphere. In SAO first arc people can die, but players still carry out their daily events like rape, killing, fun, sleeping with no care,sex, marriage. On the other hand In Log horizon if players actually die, they can still respawn at the respawn point. But, Still way too serious on focusing Politics, Govt, rules and regulations 85% of the anime revolves around this. These kind of genres was needed in SAO and SAO in Log Horizon.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- Here I can agree with Log Horizon's fans. SAO has poor characters and character development. The whole show revolves around our female attracter kirito as an OP MC even if new characters are introduced like Sinon in GGO. Kirito is still the main attraction (Yes, clearly the main attraction specially in GGO* ) \\n\\n\r\n-Where as in Log Horizon has better and lovable characters and personalities but, then again I think it just has way too many characters. Just see the opening of the Log Horizon how many characters it has. I had a hard time remembering all of them. Every episode at least introduce 2 new characters though not all are given enough development, and some are soon forgotten but, at least this series has 3 main characters that is Shiroe, Akatsuki, Naotsugu unlike SAO where every season old characters are treated like background wallpapers except kirito. I am gonna give a brief review on both the MCs of these shows.\\n\\n\r\nKirito- Yes he is OP to the point he can overwrite codes of the games, just with willpower, female attracter ( Agree with this because for real if you save a female twice, she will have some sort of feels for you), but all they back off when they realize kirito is in relationship with asuna. So, NO ITS NOT HAREM! You will also see huge improvement from Season 1 to Season 2. Kirito's OP moments are toned down a lot, he defeated death gun with the help of sinon and Kirito is not even the main character in the mother's rosario arc. Asuna gets major development and it was really emotional . You gotta give credit, where you see improvement! \\n\\n\r\nShiroe- He is OP too but not as OVER OP as kirito. When it comes to flawless strategies shiroe beats kirito, but if it comes to power and skills kirito> Shiroe. Shiroe is a mage class unlike Kirito's melee class, But you will hardly see Shiroe in a battle. Most of the time, It will be side characters who fights in the battle. All Shiroe does in the battle is act as a narrator give battle's explanation, even in those battles where shiroe's contribution is null to the battle plan. As for female attractor Shiroe is quite a charm himself. Akatuski likes him and there's one more girl who likes him. So, Currently there is a love triangle going-on and one more girl who wants Shiroe on her side.\\n\\n\r\nArt- SAO beats Log horizon here, because of beautiful colors used in animation and actually you can see improvements of the animation from season 1- season 2, where as Log Horizon remains the same. You will see no improvement! \\n\\n\r\nSound- Again SAO takes the thrown why? Log horizon opening song is sure is damn good, but from episode 1-25 it uses same opening song, and just to make the listeners get fed up of the song even more. Creators uses same opening song for the season 2 ANOTHER 25 EPISODES SAME OPENING AGAIN where as SAO Opening songs changes every arc. Now, if we compare the ending songs SAO takes the cake easily. ED2 of SAO II is so far the best ending song in the whole SAO series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- SAO has a replay value for some, where as Log Horizon none because there's hardly any impressive fight scenes all there is politics, how to make govt. etc. The season 2 of Log horizon is really disappointing compare to S1. Here, I guess fans can agree at least SAOII>Log Horizon II\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S- I know my review might make many users flipping middle finger to the monitor and be like (F*** this guy). But, hey this is just what I feel and it is my personal opinion!",

            "content": "[spoilers] I really don't believe that Sword Art Online 2 deserves the 3-4/10 scores it has been receiving as it is largely a big improvement over the mess that was the ALO arc of Sword Art Online 1. \r\nGGO - this new arc brings an interesting new VRMMO world and setting along with new main character, Sinon who has an interesting background and has some decent character development throughout the arc until she manages to overcome her fears in the real world. There are definitely some pacing issues as there is an episode where there is only talking in a cave which offers some gooddialogue but may feel slow. The fight scenes are of course well animated, especially Kiritos photon sword effects. \\n\\n\r\nCalibur Arc - It doesn't offer much relevance to the main story and was originally a side story in the SAO light novels but it does offer some interesting story for the side characters like Klein. \\n\\n\r\nMother's Rosario - This arc is supposed to be one of the best arcs in the light novels and I believe it was handled quite well. Although it is a bit short there is definitely time to care about Yuuki. The fight scenes between Asuna and Yuuki were animated very well. It also offers some interesting development for Asuna as she tries to become strong in the real world by standing up to her mom and allowing her to see things from her perspective. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Both Ignite and Courage are great opening themes and Shirushi (ED3) is amazing. The soundtrack is well done again but does use a lot of SAO 1 tracks. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good animation as usual. Fight scenes are handled well",

            "content": "*Minor spoilers ahead*\r\nThere are a lot of things that can be said about Sword Art Online, and most of those things are not pleasant. I will not mince words: I am no fan of the series. The first season was filled with so many issues, both significant and minor, that even watching a single episode was an incredible test of patience. There were some neat ideas hidden in between the mountains of nonsense, and while I can understand why the show was so enjoyable to so many people, in my case, it was like an aneurysm waiting to happen. \r\nThere is often a dichotomy ofopinions towards the show. There are the fans who adore the characters and setting and staunchly defend their right to enjoy whatever they please, and then there are the critics who despise everything the series stands for, often going to the extreme of attacking the fanbase and treating the series like it is an abomination forged in the fiery pits of hell. And that is precisely why, regardless of which side you stood on, Sword Art Online was likely not the kind of series that could be given a shrug and promptly forgotten. \\n\\n\r\n\"Was\". The same cannot be said for the second season of Sword Art Online. Whereas the first season was either the song of angels or the cacophony of demons, the second season is the essence of mediocrity. It delivers even more of the virtual reality-MMORPG setting and Kirito's usual 'time to save the day and wink at my bitches' attitude, but that's really all it is: 'more'. It's not offensively bad like the first season was (though it does come close at times), nor does it deliver anything to keep the fans particularly excited. It is a sequel that exists to be a sequel. It exists because the author created a successful franchise and thus he needed to keep the fans appeased by throwing more Kirito and Asuna their way. The story could and should have ended after the first arc, but profits seem to speak more than artistic expression. So it goes. \\n\\n\r\nTo have a discussion about Sword Art Online is to discuss its flaws. There is almost an endless supply of issues to complain about, and while I will not be able to mention all of them (lest this review reach novella length), I also do not believe that enjoyment alone is enough reason to praise an anime. So you will have to forgive me for nitpicking the show to death. The little things do add up after a while. Death by a thousand cuts, they say. \\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online's lacklustre second offering begins with the initially promising (and quickly disappointing) Gun Gale Online, or GGO arc. After the events of the first season, Kirito is tasked with investigating the murder of several people within GGO, because... well, apparently a teenager is more capable than the police or a federal agent who has actually been trained in investigation. He is also forced by his contractor to play in the game as a female avatar, because reasons. If that is supposed to be a method to help conceal his identity, it certainly does not have any effect when he continues to refer to himself as \"Kirito\". Most likely, the author simply put this in so that the fans might be able to write yuri doujins and fulfil their secret desire to be the little girl. That's cool either way, but it doesn't do much to establish the series as something that can be taken even remotely seriously. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of his female avatar, Kirito is seemingly the only guy in the entire game who plays as the opposite sex. You would think that pretty normal (it's common enough that people often have to question the real-world gender of female avatars), but every single guy in the game believes without a shred of doubt that Kirito is actually a girl. And so they hit on him and fawn over him. Sinon even goes into a full-blown rage when she finds out about Kirito's actual gender, stating how she feels betrayed and how Kirito was a liar for not telling her in the first place. Like... okay? I guess the author felt it necessary to turn Kirito into a heroine himself because there somehow wasn't enough fanservice already, what with all the frequent shots that stare directly at Sinon's butt. \\n\\n\r\nKirito being Kirito, he immediately makes a name for himself by winning a near-impossible minigame with little to no effort. And while, sure, it isn't too strange that someone would immediately get the feel for an MMORPG, it is certainly a problem when his playstyle is utterly contrary to the nature of the game. GGO is not a game about melee combat; it is about guns, grenades and positioning. If a player decides to pull a knife twenty feet away from someone with a machine gun, they will be absolutely and utterly destroyed. Or at least that would be common sense, if sense actually applied to Kirito. He decides to use a lightsaber (yes, seriously) in a first-person shooter and then proceeds to dodge or cut every single bullet that ever crosses his path, and in one case, even sends a bullet flying into a building which then causes the entire thing to collapse (apparently he deflected a tank shell). Perhaps Kirito is some sort of god, seeing as he can think and react thousands of times faster than any other human being. The show explains it away with some 'high agility stats' nonsense, failing to realise that Kirito predicting the path of dozens of bullets two feet in front of him requires superhuman thought just as it requires superhuman speed. It seems Kirito is so powerful that petty concepts such as sense do not apply to him. Praise be to our God, Kirito. May he forever bless us.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, the addition of Sinon creates a bit of a distraction from the Kirito bollocks, but her being a female character, she still inevitably becomes a part of Kirito's harem. And he manages to swoon her by spouting some of the most embarrassingly clich\u00e9 lines I've perhaps ever seen in an anime. Let me quote one of his brilliant lines: \"No one dies alone. When that person dies, the part of them that lives within someone else dies too. You already live within me!\" And yes, this is actually something he says within the show. Now excuse me while I go and vomit. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also one particularly obnoxious scene in the second episode where Sinon, falling from the top of a skyscraper, somehow dodges all but one of the hundreds of bullets hurling at her from the gattling gun below. All of them land just a few feet below her, which one would assume is because the shooter is trying to match his aim with her falling speed, except if he wasn't completely lacking in brain cells, he would realise that all he needs to do is stop moving his aim for a fraction of a second and Sinon would be annihilated. No such thing happens, and Sinon sends a sniper bullet through his head as she approaches the ground (because that is how sniper rifles work), spouts a cheesy catchphrase (\"The end!\") and lands with one of those clich\u00e9 shots where where her back faces her dying enemy. I'm not sure if this was scene was supposed to be 'cool' or something, because the only emotions it conveyed to me were frustration and embarrassment-- embarrassment over the fact that I just finished watching something that even 10-year-olds would think dumb.  \\n\\n\r\nSinon's trauma is somewhat interesting, for it at least creates a character in the show who is actually flawed as a person. But the manner in which this trauma is developed is far from great. She's portrayed as being emotionally strong, even more so than Asuna or Our God Kirito, and then as soon as she sees the same pistol that was used in the incident from her trauma, she immediately turns into a suicidal mess, saying how she doesn't care about dying while actively making an attempt to survive. Whatever. The trauma is not there to develop Sinon's character in any meaningful way or to carry any message about the struggles of post-traumatic stress disorder, but simply exists to establish her as a tragic heroine so that the audience can pity her and empathise with Kirito's desire to protect her. How exciting.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also tries to create a trauma for Kirito too, although it only ever comes across as a lame, cloying attempt to make him a darker character. He is apparently haunted by his SAO days where he was forced, in self-defense, to kill two player characters who were murderers themselves. He is so damaged by the incident that in one scene, a nurse actually hugs and comforts him, but his supposed trauma is never explored in any depth and is forgotten about as quickly as it is mentioned. The fact that he can laugh, smile and engage in PvP only moments later is a testament to the fact that it never really mattered in the first place. It also shows that the author has no idea what kind of character he even wants Kirito to be: is he a dark anti-hero or a light-hearted goof who just happens to be good at MMORPGs? The show has no idea. It throws Kirito from personality to personality, to the point where you have no idea who the hell he even is any more. \\n\\n\r\nThe story surrounding the antagonist of GGO (cheesily named \"Death Gun\") deserves a small amount of praise for its willingness to change the show's formula a little bit by creating a meaningful connection between the virtual world and the real world. The way in which Death Gun carries out his crimes is actually quite neat, but the identity of the killer is perhaps less so. The killer immediately transforms into a raging lunatic the second their identity is revealed, committing their crimes for reasons as dumb as \"I hate my parents\". Is it so difficult to write an antagonist that actually has personality and a legitimate (though disagreeable) reason for their actions? It's not as though every person who ever commits a bad deed is a psychopath. Normal people do bad things, too. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the suspense of Death Gun's murder spree is created through dumb contrivances, though. The characters cannot log out in the middle of the tournament, meaning it is impossible to avoid being killed by Death Gun unless they defeat him in the game themselves. I am pretty sure it would be against every sort of law imaginable, especially after the SAO incident, for players to not be able to leave the game whenever they please. What if there's something urgent going on in the real world and they can't get to it because the tournament is taking longer than expected? What if their bloody house is on fire? This restriction is utterly asinine and would never actually exist, but I suppose there wouldn't be much story if it didn't. Sword Art Online is less interested in creating a believable world and more in twisting and changing everything about it to fit with the author's whims. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of GGO is over before it ever really starts. It's a shame, because the setting actually carried a surprising amount of potential. The post-apocalyptic, mercenary-led and cyberpunk wasteland of GGO is far more exciting than the tired 'fairies and elves and swords' fantasy of SAO and ALO. Once the fight with Death Gun is wrapped up, Kirito and his harem simply move on to the next game without much care. \\n\\n\r\nExcept the 'next game' is just ALO all over again. The second arc of the story is a forgettable haze of nothing. All that happens during these three episodes is that Kirito obtains the most powerful sword in the game, because he wasn't already powerful enough, or something? There's also more utter stupidity like Kirito and his party being pulled into a questline that can actually delete the entire game's data. I am absolutely sure the developers would program something that allows years of hard work and their entire source of revenue to be brought to nothing. Right. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the next game is more ALO, too, although the story does attempt to take a different turn in the third (and final) arc by temporarily passing the protagonist baton to Asuna. But even a lack of Kirito seemingly cannot do much to improve the series. Even with the incredible amount of detail given to Asuna's character-- her troubled relationship with her mother who wants her to lead a normal life, her feelings about the future and her struggle to save a newfound friend-- somehow, after all those episodes and all those awful things she had to deal with, Asuna was still the exact same person she was during her first appearance. She does nothing but fill the shoes of what many would consider the 'perfect girlfriend'. She is lacking in flaws and devoid of personality. She's just a pretty face who goes through some bad things. I suppose the aim shouldn't even have been to develop her character, but to give her a character in the first place. If you throw a rock into a tornado, it will still remain a rock once it reaches the ground. \\n\\n\r\nAmong the dozens of other things in the third arc to find issue with, there is one particular scene that comes to mind. As Asuna and her new friends are fighting to reach the boss room before another group of people, Kirito somehow, conveniently, shows up as a part of their reinforcements. He decides to betray them all for Asuna and her friends' sake, and holds off the twenty or so people completely on his own. The initial half of the enemy party decides to use healers, and one of Asuna's allies then complains that they're \"not being fair\", as if using healing magic in an MMORPG is somehow a new concept. They manage to win despite being vastly outnumbered, and as Asuna and her party enter the boss room, Kirito, surrounded by flames, makes a peace sign while holding off the horde of enemy players. Somehow I think this scene might feel more appropriate in a teenager's fanfiction. \\n\\n\r\nIt should also be mentioned how cringe-worthy any scene with Yui is, such as when Kirito writes a program so that she can 'see' through the cafe's camera and then hang out with them in reality. Please. She's an annoying NPC, not the daughter of a bloody teenager. If she were to be erased from the entire story I doubt anyone would complain. \\n\\n\r\nAnd why are Kirito and Asuna so incapable of showing physical affection? They've been dating for three years now and even made virtual babies with each other in SAO, but in the real world they do not dare kiss or engage in sexual activities. It makes their relationship feel very weak, superficial-- almost like the author is afraid of fully committing them to one another because it would make Kirito unable to have his harem. The show eliminates any sense of a realistic romantic relationship by attempting to appease both harem and Asuna fans, except in reality, it has quite the opposite effect. Those who want to see the relationship between Kirito and Asuna developed will only find themselves disappointed, and those who want more of the harem will find themselves even more disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with Kirito's harem is that all its members are there only as eye candy. Even Kirito's bouncy sister is pushed to the side and made irrelevant, despite her receiving so much screentime in the previous season that it seemed things were about to develop into a love triangle. Nope. All that was for nothing. She and the others all still follow Kirito along, finding themselves jealous whenever he and Asuna share a tender moment, and really, what is the point in them even being there at this point? To remind us they exist so that they can used in ero-doujins? Great. \\n\\n\r\nFurthering this issue is the show's reluctance to write in male characters that are not raging lunatics or utterly irrelevant. Kirito is the only male in the entire story who ever matters. None of the girls have any interest in Klein or any of the other males; they just fight over Kirito despite the fact that he is already (supposedly) in a relationship. It's not that there needed to be another male character with his own love interests, given that Sword Art Online is absolutely terrible at writing romance, but the least the show could do is give Klein and the others a bit more attention. Klein exists only as some random dude that tags along with Kirito, and it's a shame, because he's a hell of a lot more interesting than Kirito ever was. \\n\\n\r\nThe last few episodes carry a fair share of emotional weight, but it's quite difficult to care much about what's going on when the entire arc moves at lightning speed. Asuna and Yuuki act like they're best friends after only knowing each other for about two days, and it's not much longer until Asuna starts rushing to her side in the real-world and crying for her sake. Sure, it's pretty hard not to feel sorry for Yuuki given how crappy her situation is, but the audience is just thrown into the drama without being given any time to think about what's going on. I'm not the kind of person who believes there is something inherently wrong with shock value, but I mean, for god's sake, the least you could do is give me some reason to be invested in the characters first. It's just melodrama without purpose. \\n\\n\r\nThe actual fight scenes are also thoroughly disappointing. There are no longer any situations where the characters' lives feel at stake. It's a video game and Kirito is incapable of defeat. Most of these are barely longer than two minutes, anyway, so if you were looking forward to massive boss battles and crazy nonsense from the first season like Kirito's dual-wielding skill, there is none of that here. The show instead spends most of its budget on Sinon's ass. \\n\\n\r\nDoes Sword Art Online look nice? Sure. And it sounds nice, too. But no matter how pretty the scenery and how intense the main battle theme is, it cannot make the unexciting exciting. Unless the music is married with an appropriate scene, it will achieve nothing if not being awkward, and often the scenes in Sword Art Online feel awkward. All Sword Art Online does is look and sound nice-- in this case, the wrapping paper is more exciting than the contents. \\n\\n\r\nThe show has some issues. \\n\\n\r\nI still feel there's so much I've missed and so much more that needs to be said about the series. I've tried my best to assort all my angry groans and rolled eyes into something that actually resembles a proper piece of writing, so if it feels like a massive wall of whining, I apologise. There was a lot to whine about.\\n\\n\r\nAnd no, I don't believe that my standards being \"too high\" is a valid rebuttal. Standards are not something that anyone should ever apologise for. It does not matter if a show strives to be some intellectual commentary or if it's content just being simple-ass entertainment (and Sword Art Online definitely falls on the \"simple-ass entertainment\" side of the spectrum). If a show is dumb enough that you can enjoy it only by turning your brain off, then it is not something that is worth your time. There is plenty of entertainment out there that can be enjoyed while the brain cells are in use. Some of them are even aimed at children (see: Aikatsu, Cardcaptor Sakura or My Neighbour Totoro), so I don't see much reason to force yourself to enjoy mediocrity when quality is easily available. \\n\\n\r\nBut if you enjoy Sword Art Online, that's OK too. You're free to watch and enjoy whatever the hell you damn well please, and the people who say you are a lesser person for enjoying mindless entertainment are just as mindless themselves. Sword Art Online definitely has a great deal of appeal among younger folk and MMORPG fans, but please, if you enjoyed the series in any capacity, do yourself a favour and do not conflate your personal enjoyment with critical quality. Fun does not necessarily mean good. It often does-- how can we appreciate something we hate watching, after all?-- but in this case, the enjoyability of Sword Art Online has nothing to do with its merit as a story. Because it doesn't have any.\\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online is a mess and it needs some shovelling.",

Let us become OP, plot armored, self insert chick magnets so that we can build our own harem. Bless the harem oh Lord, that it be deemed worthy of your hax abilities, AMEN!\r\nStory: 2/10\r\n     You know how you can tell if a story is retarded? When the only way it can continue is if your main character makes an extremely illogical decision, that anyonewith common sense would normally refuse. \"Escaped a game where you almost died and suffered psychological scars as a result? Well why not jump into another one :D !\" ...The show has yet to get pass episode 1 and has already proven that a room full of monkeys could write a better script. But I won't completely kick SAO II in the balls, as they didn't repeat the crazy timeskips like before. \\n\r\n     You know what you don't do with a 24 episode run? try to squeeze in 3 disjointed arcs into one. You thought the move from Sword Art to Alfheim in season 1 felt left field?  Well the transition from Gun Gale to Alfheim takes the cake.\\n\r\nThe mini mission arc in the middle isn't even worth mentioning, since the whole purpose was to simply make Jesus-kun more hax than he already was by giving him the legendary sword Excalibur (sorry Saber).\\n\r\nThen there's the final arc.. Which was a melodramatic story  for the sake of getting the fans to cry a river.  \"Video games help make AIDS suck less\".. now try saying that out loud without facepalming yourself into a coma.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAs much as the SAO franchise make me grit my teeth,  it should go without saying that they have great production value. This was no exception as they made a visual spectacle that is pleasing to the eyes. The vibrant color of the game world will keep even a person with ADD attentive. The cinematics are also top notch, as the fighting sequence will have you creaming your pants. \\n\r\nHowever I can't say the same for the character designs. If you take a still shot you'll realize every character shares the same face, which is beyond lazy... But hey, I guess God really did make everyone in his own image.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nTo add to the visuals, we're also given a score to match the mood. Each scene is matched with a musical theme that works in unison. The OP & ED are even good stand alone listens. The voice actors were also fine, but no stand outs come to mind. They did what was needed to carry the show, and that to the least deserves credit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters from Jesus-kun's harem don't even receive any roles other than being the sideline cheer squad for our MC. Even Klein, who started out promising in season 1, is degraded to comedic relief. The main antagonist from GGO, Darth Vade-... I mean Death Gun was, believe it or not, a good idea for this series. Through him they tried to give Jesus-kun an internal conflict via post traumatic stress disorder. They also tried this with Jesus-kun's new harem addition Shino.. Now notice how I said \"TRIED\" as nothing really changed after the following arc was over. Kirito remained the plot convenient God and Shino simply fell in line as another conquered piece of ass by our savior.  The last character worth mentioning was Yuuki, who only survived the Harem God's clutches by succumbing to AIDs. Introduced in episode 19, we're only given 5 episodes to give a fuck... This is a text book example of forced drama, making Yuuki's existence to be nothing more than a token sympathy character, rather than an actual person. The only good thing to come out of this cast was Asuna, who finally got more screen time. Despite her \"development\" being brought on by forced drama it was better than having Jesus-kun bask in the limelight. Which in turn made SAO II slightly more tolerable than the season 1 trainwreck. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite its 5 page MLA format filled with problems, I enjoyed SAO II for what it was. They tried to develop a few of its characters. They tried to improve the shit story of season 1. And they tried to shine light on someone other than Jesus-kun. Although they failed in spectacular fashion, it was still fun watching it do so. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nSAO II excels in the audiovisual department but once again repeated its past mistake of having borderline retarded characters and story. For those seeking to give SAO redemption with this continuation don't hold your breath as it still remains in cesspool quality territory. However If you're a fan of this series and have yet to watch it then by all means give it a go, as it does improve some flaws that were apparent with season 1.",

            "content": "Mod edit: Review my contain spoilers.\r\n-------------------\r\n*Sigh... What am I doing with my life? Seriously: What do I have to gain by bashing this show? I\u2019m certainly not the first one to rip this anime and its inane hype train a new one and I definitely won\u2019t be the last. Therefore, forcing myself to sit through yet another collection of incompetent pacing, plot points that make no sense what so ever, and an unbearable self-insertion protagonist doesn\u2019t really seem to be worthwhile, does it? And yet here we are. Goddamn it\u2026 Ladies and gentleman: It\u2019s fucking back\r\nSynopsis: After restoring VRMMORPGs to their previous glory by beingthe total badass he is, Kazuto Kirigaya is approached by a detective who wants his help investigating the \u201cDeath Gun\u201d incident. This incident is a recent event in which a mysterious user who goes by the SUPER original name of \u201cDeath Gun\u201d somehow managed to kill another user in real life by merely shooting him in the VRMMORPG \u201cGun Gale Online\u201d. Kirito agrees, enters the game, is instantly amazing at it (shockingly), meets a sniper girl named Sinon, and enters a big tournament with the hopes of facing off against the mysterious \u201cDeath Gun\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nNow, that plot summary probably makes the reader raise a few questions, such as: \u201cWhy is the police department recruiting a random highschooler with a documented history of VRMMORPG-caused psychological trauma?\u201d, \u201cWhy does Kirito, the man who almost lost his life and witnessed others lose their lives in a video game, doubt so harshly the possibility of death through amusphere?\u201d, or \u201cWhy God? Why is there a second season of SAO?\u201d Well, unsurprisingly, none of those questions will be answered. However, that shaky premise is only the modest start to a slew of other problems that this show truly suffers from, and most of them are even worse than the first season.\\n\\n\r\nArguably the biggest flaw of the show is that the pacing is PAINFULLY slow. I\u2019m not exaggerating; each episode covers about two sentences worth of plot. For a show that\u2019s supposed to be centered around action, it is astoundingly boring this time around. It wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable for the first four episodes to be condensed into one; then we would be talking. Unfortunately, the show never addresses this issue and smacks us across the face with filler as it drags itself out for as long as possible. It's unwatchable at times.\\n\\n\r\nAnother major issue is the fact that the plot no longer has any suspense and provides no reason for the viewer to care about what is happening. In SAO\u2019s first arc, we at least had a reason to care about what was happening inside the video game because it was life or death; the stakes were high and lives were on the line. In THIS season, however, the only driving force for us to care about the virtual world no longer exists outside of spurts of laughably forced melodrama. As evidenced by episode 2, the show tries to be theatrical/dramatic in order to convince the audience that what is happening in the game is REALLY important when it so obviously is not. I kid you not; there is a scene in this episode where a full-grown man almost has a mental breakdown because his PH (player hunter) clan was losing a fight. \u2026DUDE. IT\u2019S A FUCKING GAME. We are forced to listen to Sinon (more on her later) give us a ridiculous, obnoxious speech about how logging out and giving up on the battle is \u201cdishonorable\u201d, AS SHE IS KILLING AND LOOTING INNOCENT PLAYERS. Yeah, real sense of \u201chonor\u201d you got there. This might have worked in the first season when the stakes were legitimately high, but when the setting of your story changes drastically, you must adjust the content accordingly! I mean, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m surprised that this show doesn\u2019t make any fucking sense what so ever, but I still have to point it out. Overall, this is just an unbearably stupid plot, as per usual. Impossible to take seriously.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters\u2026 well... what can I say that hasn\u2019t already been said about Kirito? He is made only to pander to male-power fantasies. He is amazing at everything he does, he gets all the girls, and he has no flaws what so ever, etc. Basically, you wish you were Kirito. He is made for the purposes of self-insertion, and while people who know anything about storytelling recognize that this is a SHIT way to write characters, Kirito has been instrumental to the show\u2019s popularity. I HATE that this is the kind of character that becomes popular nowadays, but that\u2019s part of the reason I am writing this review; if enough people don\u2019t complain, it will continue to happen. Don't even get me started on the laughable ways that they try to get the audience to sympathize with him. The only other major characters this season are Sinon and Asuna. Let's start with Sinon, who is another completely worthless, helpless female for Kirito to add to his harem. The show tries to characterize her by describing her devout fear of guns, and I mean DEVOUT. This girl is apparently so scared of guns that she vomits all over herself just by glancing at a FAKE gun (\u2018cause that\u2019s totally believable\u2026). Now, you may be asking yourself, \u201cHow can someone who is so irrationally scared of guns be a top player in a super-realistic VRMMORPG that is obviously multiple steps above the intensity of holding a toy gun in your hands?\u201d Well reader, shut up. This is SAO. Never question it again. \u2026In all seriousness though, her entire backstory is just completely laughable because it doesn\u2019t make any sense at all. One of the worst portrayals of PTSD I\u2019ve ever seen in media. Any personality traits she may have been given eventually fade away into the same old harem-girl bullshit at the first sight of Kirito. Valiant effort, A-1, at least you are trying harder, but this character still sucks. As for Asuna, you already know the drill. A misogynistic object for Kirito to impress and presumably bang. She has an arc dedicated all to herself this season, and it's the cheesiest thing I've ever seen in my entire life. It's like SAO learned to write dialogue entirely through trashy romance novels. Very, very cringey. I won't say anything to spoil the villain of the first arc, but oh my god, if you are in need of a laugh, this show's midseason finale is a must watch. I was literally crying from laughter. That's how stupid SAO's villains are. Maybe worse than season one's.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion\u2026 It\u2019s fucking SAO. If you liked the first season and were able to somehow overlook its ludicrous amount of flaws, then you will probably like season two as well. If you actually have standards, recognized how incredibly overrated the first season was, and hated it, you will also hate this season. To be fair though, the show is still well animated and the music is still great. I\u2019m also willing to admit that SAO has a certain charm to it that shines through despite its major problems, which is probably the reason it has gotten so popular. Do I recommend this anime? No, not unless you are a young teenaged male, but it\u2019s not the worst I\u2019ve seen.",

            "content": "It came, almost like if it has been created for one purpose: polarize the public opinion, and yet the same scenario from back then take place, to be or not to be.... mediocre? I guess the answer was already given in that first season, I'll just throw it here, if we're watching this sequel we already know what to expect, there won't be a glorious comeback, we're watching the wrong franchise otherwise, SAO II is the same old SAO after all.. and for those who understand this basic concept, it might be entertaining somehow, I won't hide that fact, just make sure to leave thecommon sense and critic spirit in the next room before you close the door, that it's.\\n\\n\r\nSAO II inherited everything from it's predecessor, specially the bad traits that characterized the first season, traits that were a lot more in highlights this time since we had already experienced them, we live for the second time those faults that made infamous the first season, we could almost say it's practically a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Such traits are numerous, we could generalize and call the amount of the bad traits: The SAO Formula, a pattern of events presented since Aincrad, proposed again in Fairy Dance, and finally in this last installment, Phantom Bullet. Being able to determinate such pattern is not something difficult, we could summarize and say: \"Kirito came, Kirito saw, Kirito conquered\", but since this is a review let's analyze a bit better this concept.\\n\\n\r\nPhantom Bullet takes place a year and half later the SAO incident, Kirito, now living the normal high school life, is approached again by Seijiro Kikuoka, some guy from the Government, who informs him that a series of mysterious murders were happening, where?, obviously inside another Virtual Game. After the previous fantasy themed arcs, this time we have a characterized cyberpunk environment, a huge breath of fresh air, which provides in the only campus SAO distinguish itself, whiteout failing miserably, the Setting (I'll talk about this later). Gun Gale Online, the virtual reality game where a mysterious avatar called Death Gun seems to have the power to \"kill\" the players inside the game. After a remarkable phrase by our protagonist: \"There's no way that someone can be killed inside a game!\", almost like if his memories from the SAO incident were erased, he decides to find the culprit by entering this new world, Kirito goes to investigate!.\\n\\n\r\nThis is when The SAO Formula emerge completely, in correspondence like the previous arcs, Kirito is assisted by a new female character, in a new game, in a game where you could die in the real world, with an overly pathetic character as villain (Yup, a complete new environment!), but leaving aside those utterly obvious facts, the thing I disliked the most was the absence of simple Logic. If in the first season were remarkable deus ex machinas and bad developed scenes, in SAO II we have the complete absence of logic reasoning. \\n\\n\r\n(Now I'll write some phrases with the interrogation point just to emphasize better my point of view)\\n\\n\r\nLeaving Kirito completely alone during the investigation phase?, Laughing Coffin members that should have been arrested for murder after the SAO incident?, a guarantee security for those, possible, Death Gun's targets by placing some cops inside their house?... no? what about tracing somehow the IP?... for god's sake we're already in a future where Virtual Reality exist and the police can't really trace a player inside a game? and their only savior is a 17 years old kid?, c'mon!.\\n\\n\r\nThis season is characterized by Stupidity itself, there are no words able to justify the overly idiotic events occurred, because if there were for the previous season, this time there aren't. And we have yet to talk about how ended Phantom Bullet, the cherry in this cake!, the climax... but that would be spoiler so I won't, I'll just say instead: \"ASADA-SAN, ASADA-SAN, ASADA-SAN!!!\", you'll understand later and when you reach that part, drop a laugh in my honor.\\n\\n\r\nIn a similar mode as the previous arcs, the plot focuses only on Kirito and the new girl (The SAO Formula in action again!), ASSada Shino, while leaving aside the others characters that were once important in the previous arcs, reducing their screen time to only a few scenes. That means we don't get any Asuna or Suguha, already side characters, or how I like to say: \"They became part of Kirito's party\", and once they join it, the characters loses their personality completely becoming a side character, part of Kirito's harem. Unlike the previous season, the characters psyche is analyzed a bit more deeply and the result is... pretty lame. Actions scenes are replaced with boring dialogues between Kirito and Sinon sharing their experiences with Death and how they dealt with them. Actually I like this kind of approach in the characters but with Kirito?... God no, it doesn't feel right in SAO, it doesn't fit the anime. Cool actions scenes with great soundtrack fits more the show, but that wasn't delivered, in part. The only thing that won't miss in this sequel, in every scene, is Sinon's compact ass, we got a picture of it in every possible angle.\\n\\n\r\nIn this second installment Phantom Bullet isn't the only material adapted from the Light Novel, there's also some arcs we could consider as fillers but they aren't, they're present in the Light Novel. Only from SAO we could expect actual canon material to have that unique air that fillers have, anyway these two arcs are Caliber and Mother's Rosario. While the attempt of Excaliber is to light the mood before the heavy drama oriented Mother's Rosario, the result we get it's the exposure of The SAO Formula, yes again. Caliber focuses in Kirito's party, Sinon, already part of his harem, with the special participation of the other girls, Asuna & Company, aid Kirito to complete an ALO Quest. Meanwhile Mother's Rosario focuses on Asuna and her meet with a mysterious girl named Yuuki, drama development is guaranteed.\\n\\n\r\nLike previously commented, SAO II inherited everything from the previous season, also those things worth to be praised, the Animation, the Setting and Soundtracks. Extremely fluid animation followed through the actions scenes meanwhile -not the best Yuki Kajiura recycled work- harmonized the environment. The Setting is something I really liked from the SAO franchise, it's detailed and somehow it drags you inside, Fantasy and Fairy tale like from the previous arcs and now GGO's cyberpunk, it's notable the effort done to create this, I tip my hat. OPs & EDs singles managed to be catchy but a lot less compared to the previous season, anyway \"Courage\" by Haruka Tomatsu is worth an illegal download at least.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I wouldn't consider it a total waste of time, this show is watchable, I won't say it's a pile of crap or rage about it, I mean, if you're watching SAO II you already know how this was going to be, so I'll just express my expected disappointment with a big \"Meehhh\" and end this review right here.",

            "content": "Another flagship of the Anime Industry has ended again today. While some people would be delighted by Sao II ending, most are left wanting more and eagerly anticipating the next Sword Art Online. While the series itself is not perfect, I wouldn't say it's garbage as some would say it. I am going to cover the three arcs as separate rather than as a whole so it would highlight their strengths and weaknesses better, then combine it to an overall score.\r\nStory, Phantom Bullet(8/10): The first arc is the meat of SAO II. It has the most episodes spanning 14  of the overall 24. Here,Kirito ends up in a VR called Gun Gale Online where he is tasked to investigate the deaths of VR players in the real world by them supposedly dying in the Virtual world. The story was crafted excellently, while it did have a slow start at first, the ending was satisfying. There are however inconsistencies to how the story picks up the pace. For instance, the story already jumped to Bullet of Bullets in the very first few episodes, then it jumps to Kirito defeating other players easily, then a duel with Sinon, then after defeating Death Gun. It feels rushed even though the story presented itself well. It doesn't give itself enough time to catch up with itself, it sends Kirito to battle and ends with KIrito beating his enemies. The story though is packed with the Impossibilities like the first SAO. This Time, characters are haunted by their past , and it's up to Kirito to guide them out of it. While that may seem irrelevant to the story, it adds a little emotional impact to the overall arc.\\n\\n\r\nStory, Calibur(7/10): The second arc of SAO II. Here we find Kirito and his Harem + Klein back in Alfheim. They all do a quest to retrieve Excalibur from an Ice Kingdom and ultimately save Alfheim altogether. While it was a good watch, I felt the story was the weakest out of all the arcs. It didn't offer anything new, and it didn't bring out anything we haven't necessarily seen before in the SAO franchise. It's basically an arc dedicated for Kirito to get an upgrade. It is still refreshing to see the old team back together including Sinon to clear out dungeons and let them show off their skills after seeing Kirito slaughtering every bit of competition he has out there.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory, Mother's Rosario(9/10): The third arc, this is where I don't want to go into detail about because it's an arc where you should see for yourself. I personally think this is the best arc out  of SAO II. It doesn't focus on action as much as the previous arcs, it focuses a lot on characters and their hardships in the real world. While some may get turned off by that, it really is a good arc to see further character development in some characters. \\n\\n\r\nStory, Overall (8/10): From the first to the last arcs, the story was great. While a side arc did manage to outshine the main arc for me, it still was a great story to marvel at.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(9/10): SAO II brings to you a new cast with very enjoyable characters. Kirito, Asuna, and the old gang are still there. With the exception of Kirito, and Asuna on the third arc. Most of them were hardly touched. Kirito still drives the main story further with help from new characters. The first up is Sinon. Sinon later became my favorite heroine at the the end of the the first arc. Maybe i just have a thing for girls with a heavy anti-material rifle for a weapon. You get to see into her past and her reason to play a game like Gun Gale. She seeks strength and finds that within Kirito. The next up is Yuuki and the gang on the third arc. This is where the emotional aspect of the show is centered. Konno Yuuki is labeled as Zekken, or Absolute Sword. She is they say the strongest player in Alfheim. While she's strong in the Virtual world in the real world she faces countless problems. It's the same with the rest of the Sleeping Knights. They face numerous problems in real life, and they dive into the Virtual world to escape those problems. You see the relationship grow between Asuna and the Sleeping Knights as the story progresses. You see what the characters have to face in the real world, and their methods to escape that harsh reality. \\n\\n\r\nArt(9/10): Just like in the original SAO, SAO II brings with it fantastic looking worlds and characters. Gun Gale is just amazing to look at. it's a deserted area with tons of destroyed building and broken down vehicles. Also sand, sand everywhere. It's the perfect setting for a game like Gun Gale where bullets are flying everywhere and the world looks like its going crumbling down. Alfheim is also present with beautifully crafted atmosphere. In the Calibur arc, you see what lies underneath the world tree, it was once a prosperous land, but now it's covered in ice and snow. The new bosses and characters are also made fairly well. The back ground characters do look a lot similar, but that's understandable since drawing thousands of unique faces would be a waste of time. However the main and supporting cast all have their personal touch to their avatars which makes the look admirable. #CaitSithSinon\\n\\n\r\nSound(8/10): The sound overall was good. I don't really have much complaints for the sound even though I gave it an 8. Both Openings were amazing and characters themselves weren't annoying to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9/10): I had a lot of fun watching Sword Art Online II. It gives me more to think about when I decide to let my mind wonder. Just the thought of how close a different world can be so close to us just makes me want to watch more and more. I really do hope they come out with an SAO III, it would be to sad to see an anime as great as this with more tales to tell us stop right here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(8/10): It's an enjoyable show to watch that most people often ridicule too hard because of it's growing popularity. It's a fun series with a lot of great ideas to offer. It's not perfect having some flaws, but it's not as bad as people turn it out to be. I recommend giving the series a go and decide for yourself. Do not let anyone's opinion hinder you from enjoying this show and determine for yourself if it is worthy of your time.\\n",

            "content": "Another season, another helping of extreme controversy, a countless number of attacks on the fan base, even more flame wars, and perhaps the largest amount of unfair criticisms and double standards ever seen in an anime.\r\nIn my review of the first season, I stated that \"Sword Art Online was the most over hated anime of recent decade.\" Considering what I've seen in this season and the newest criticisms against it(despite it correcting most of the weaknesses of season 1), I still stand by what I said back then.\r\nSo what do I think of it? This season has solidified my opinion that I've had about theseries since Season 1.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like Season 1, the story of SAO II is split up into separate arcs, each with a different tone and genre. These arcs are Phantom Bullet(Gun Gale Online), Calibur, and Mother's Rosario. Two of the arcs continue the trend of showing how virtual reality affects reality, while the one in between is just a simple quest.\\n\\n\r\nKeep in mind there may be spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nPhantom Bullet(Gun Gale Online) - The story focuses on perhaps the most controversial protagonist in all of anime: Kazuto Kirigaya, and a new character for this season: Shino Asada. It's about a year after the ALO incident and, yet again, another incident occurs that involves the virtual world that seems to affect the real world. This occurs in the new VRMMO of Gun Gale Online, an MMO created from The World Seed mentioned in Season 1. A player named Death Gun(who's attire looks like a cross between a mummy and the Grim Reaper) was reported in shooting players in-game, only to have them die shortly after in real life. However, unlike the Nerve Gear, which could fry a person's brain, these cases have involved another vital organ: the heart. Because of the Amusphere's improved security mentioned in Season 1, it appears that these deaths would be impossible to cause through virtual reality. Seijirou Kikuoka, a member of the Ministry of Internal Affairs that first appeared in SAO: Extra Edition, contacts Kazuto and offers him a job to investigate, knowing just how much experience he has in the full-dive environment.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall genre of this arc is murder mystery.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this was a bit of a trade-off arc. On one hand, Kirito gets more depth as a character, Sinon(Shino Asada) develops as a character by the end of the arc, and the story can be pretty engaging with the logistics behind the GGO incident. On the other hand, the action is much more limited, some characters are STILL sidelined for the most part, and the episode before the ending of the arc comes off as all kinds of disturbing. I've always loved SAO more for the story and characters, but a few of the final episodes of this arc left me with mixed feelings.\\n\\n\r\nThis being said, it was engaging the whole way through, had much better character development, and was a HUGE step up from ALfheim. 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCalibur - I'll keep it short for this arc: it focuses on the group of Kirito, Asuna, Klein, Lisbeth, Silica, Leafa, and Sinon on a quest to J\u00f6tunheimr.\\n\\n\r\nThe genre for these episodes are mainly action.\\n\\n\r\nThis arc wasn't nearly long enough to get me emotionally invested. It was nice seeing the other SAO survivors(Klein, Silica, Lisbeth) get the spotlight for fighting, but, overall, the dungeon's setting was too bleak, and the story wasn't nearly as suspenseful as other arcs. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nMother's Rosario - This arc nearly matches up to the brilliance of Aincrad in half the episodes. Asuna's character development was the main focus of this arc and just like Sinon in Gun Gale, another character is introduced in this arc: Yuuki Konno, a swords-woman that has earned the title of \"Absolute Sword\" for being the strongest player in ALfheim.\\n\\n\r\nThis arcs' genre is mainly drama. It can be pretty heartwarming with Yuuki and Asuna's interactions, but in the end it's unbearably tragic.\\n\\n\r\nMuch like most of Aincrad, I was in tears for this arc and the friendship formed between Yuuki and Asuna was beautiful. I won't spoil the ending, but it's very tragic and you'll most likely cry if you have even a shred of empathy. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: If there's one thing every viewer of Sword Art Online can agree on, it's that it has great animation, and an amazing soundtrack. This series continues the trend, so I won't go any further. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This season did a better job in the Character Development department. Overall, the characters were very three-dimensional, and have their own problems that they have to face, such as Sinon with her PTSD fear of guns, Kirito with his inner demons that revisit him from SAO, and Yuuki with her terminal illness.\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds of the new characters are introduced well, and some of the characters from the first season get more depth.\\n\\n\r\nThis being said, quite a few of the characters are still sidelined.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned that I'd have to wait for Mother's Rosario for Asuna's character development, and this arc made up for the limited amount from Season 1 flawlessly. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I mentioned that this season solidified my opinion on the series, and that opinion is that this is my all-time favorite anime. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMother's Rosario helped me realize that Sword Art Online really lives up to the 'Art' part of the name. Not only with the many interpretations that every viewer has had(both \"masterpiece\" positive and \"train wreck\" negative), but also from how it's able to connect with the fans on a very personal level and become more of an experience rather than a simple show.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nNegative Points: Episode 13 was beyond disturbing. I won't spoil it, but it was very uncomfortable.\\n\\n\r\nAction wasn't nearly as exciting as the past season.\\n\\n\r\nUnnecessary fan service that breaks tension in episode 11.\\n\\n\r\nExcluding aspects or story points from the light novels that would have improved the overall quality of the GGO arc.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're watching the English dub of Season 2, there are two contradictory lines of dialogue. One relating to a game mechanic in ALO (beast taming) during Calibur, one relating to an event in Mother's Rosario (the floor the Sleeping Knights and the SAO survivor team clear shown in the final episode, as it's supposed to be Floor 28, but they say Floor 23). These minor plot holes are only present in the English dub. The English subbed version doesn't have this fault.\\n\\n\r\nBonus Points: Still continues the trend of presenting nearly all of the information needed for understanding the plot. This as well makes the story limited in ACTUAL Plot Holes.\\n\\n\r\nGreater focus on character development helped me to connect with the characters much more than Season 1.\\n\\n\r\nFocuses more on how VR affects reality.\\n\\n\r\nAsuna going back to being a bad-ass, and getting far more development.\\n\\n\r\nAs long as you don't interpret anything the wrong way, there really isn't any other girl character that \"falls head over heels\" for Kirito, or has a crush on him. Overall, it's just a nice friendship between him and Sinon with a little bit of cute flirting solely for the purpose of trolling.\\n\\n\r\nMother's Rosario having the biggest tear-jerking moment of all tear-jerking moments in this series. (T_T)\\n\\n\r\nCorrecting a lot of the weaknesses from Season 1.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nOverall Score: 10/10 Does a great job at improving an already amazing anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can afford to give it another chance, I'd highly recommend seeing this season.\\n\\n\r\nIf you still hold hatred for this series, and don't have the capacity for being optimistic, or giving it a chance for redemption, then there's nothing I can do.",

            "content": "I started SAO II because hearing so many people saying it would adapt arcs that are vastly superior to the previous ones made me really curious about how far this franchise could go, and I bet wasn't the only one.  As I bet that I'm not the only one who was left absolutely, utterly disappointed (but not surprised) upon seeing all of the same old bullshit that made the first season so terrible repeating itself.\r\nThis review may contain spoilers from now on.\r\nSword Art Online II adapts two arcs from the novels: GGO and Mother's Rosario. Oh no, wait, it's three arcs: there's also theCalibur arc - hard to remember it even existed considering it lasted for about three episodes and had no relevance to anything at all. But again, is there even a point to anything in this show other than showcasing how amazing & powerful Kirito is and adding new girls to his harem? I guess not. SAO remains what it is in its core: a self-insert show with childish writing scattered everywhere.\\n\\n\r\nLet's talk about each arc individually. The first one, GGO, is the least weak of the bunch (not that this means anything when all of them are bad). It features Sinon, a new member of Kirito's harem - I mean, heroine, as well as a new setting. The fact that they cast aside an entirely underveloped cast of characters to introduce a new girl should already be stinky - but as if that's not enough, GGO is very sloppily written. They use the most ridiculous excuse to connect the current events to events that happened back in the first arc (I mean sure, the laughing coffin members murdered people 'n stuff, but it makes all sense that they're still out in the loose and not in jail!), as well as a MASSIVE amount of stupidity such as \"People are getting murdered inside of a game again? Well geez, I guess our only solution is sending in this 17 year old all alone to investigate this!\" The logic in this arc is piss-poor, and as anyone can guess, everything is resolved by Kirito finding out all by himself how the villain was working and who he was, with little to no base at all. I mean of course, Kirito is so awesome he figured everything out by himself! It made all the attempts made in the very same arc of giving him flaws and depth a complete joke. This arc's main antagonist is also a pathetic piece of turd with terrible characterization - you know something's wrong when a villain's entire backstory, motives and goals are explained by the protagonists while they're chatting and having coffee.\\n\\n\r\nCalibur may as well be summed up in a single phrase: What was the point? It features the \"main cast\", if they can even be called that, clearing a quest in ALO. And yeah. That's all. It feels like really, REALLY bad filler, and I have nothing else to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the last arc, Mother's Rosario: it's an arc where Asuna is the protagonist, along with Yuuki, another newly introduced character. To put it shortly, this arc will do ANYTHING to make you cry. It's as if the writer was noticing that he didn't look \"mature\" enough with the whole in-game murder thing and thought to himself \"I need to add some more drama to this\". So cue Yuuki's storyline - no, cue Yuuki's entire character, who was designed to make you cry with the whole \"My whole family is dead and I have a terminal disease\" thing. Predictably, they deal with this in a very insensitive way - it's not organic, it's not presented naturally, it's 100% designed to make you pity her. Yuuki is more defined by the fact that she's terminally ill than by her bland personality, which makes the second time in SAO II where the writer uses an illness as an accessory to earn easy tears and seem mature (the first time being with Sinon's PTSD). But as you can guess, the way it's presented and dealt with isn't mature at all, it's borderline insulting. Mother's Rosario is also supposed to be an arc where Asuna gets developed as her own character, but considering that her biggest conflict was convincing her mother that she was ready to drop everything else in her life to be with Kirito, it only furthered her role as the lead waifu of his harem.\\n\\n\r\nIf I talk about the characters it will take me another 10 paragraphs, so let me try to keep it short. Kirito is still the same thing as in the first season: Amazing, cool, incredible, smart Kirito, who finds out the truth behind serial murders by himself, cures Sinon's trauma by himself and is apparently also a mechanics genius who can make video game characters see the real world. They try to give him depth in GGO by showing that he's truly traumatized by the events of Aincrad, but it backfires horribly when right after it's shown that he's a \"strong person who keeps moving foward regardless\", a.k.a. he can get over it quite easily if the plot calls for it. They also tried to give Kirito a goal in him striving to unite the virtual and real world as one, but it backfired again as it's clear that nobody gave it enough thought to realize how stupid, dangerous and almost villainous this sounds. His smug-ish attitude towards Sinon also remains unchanged from the previous arcs, so don't worry, he's still an annoying prick on top of being a terrible self-insert character.\\n\\n\r\nSinon had everything to be a good character, as she's the first heroine in this show with a palpable personality, but they sacrifice it to make her the tsundere that was missing in Kirito's harem. They use her being understandably wary of him as an excuse to make her act tsun-tsun. There's also her backstory, which could have been good if the writer had even a slight idea of how panick attacks and PTSD actually work instead of getting them triggered whenever's convenient to the plot. Her character development revolves 100% around Kirito. Sinon's role in the show is defined by the moment she says \"Someone, please save me\" in episode 3: she wasn't there to be a character who learns to save herself and grows in the first place, she was there to be saved by Kirito and later fall in love with him. She was there to be nothing more than another disposable harem member disguised as \"strong female character\". In the end, Sinon is no better than Asuna.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Asuna, she succeeded on having the most bullshit \"character development\" I've ever seen. Introducing her family out of nowhere and sparkling conflict with her strict mother wouldn't have been that unacceptable, really, if at least she had something to fight for herself, but it doesn't count if said conflict is her mother not wanting to let her ruin her life getting married young (to Kirito, of course). Asuna's entire character arc isn't about her growing as a person, it's about strengthening her resolve to get married to Kirito - as IF she needed that, considering that her entire character is defined by her love and devotion for Kirito in the first place. Mother's Rosario did nothing for Asuna as a character as much as it did for her as a \"waifu\". She will probably be even more loved by otaku now that she fits the \"perfect wife\" stereotype better than ever, but it sure as hell doesn't make her well written. She, Kirito and their sappy romance remain as flat and unsavory as ever.\\n\\n\r\nI could write about the other characters if there even was something noteworthy to say about them. Suguha was dropped into limbo after ALO and has no relevance in the second season, but that's to be expected - if you're a female character in SAO, you only have two jobs: Falling in love/getting rescued by Kirito in a certain arc and providing fanservice. After that, it's as if you never even existed in first place. The only thing I can say about Suguha, Rika and Silica (and Sinon after GGO) is that the way they get angry at Kirito for getting attention from Asuna is extremely immature, annoying and unfunny considering that they are, you know, engaged. But again all the comedic moments in SAO sound like they were written by a horny 13 year old boy, so I guess it's nothing new after all.\\n\\n\r\nI don't have a lot to say about the animation except that in some scenes it looks pretty good and carefully done and in others it's literally slideshow bullshit (look at the first Calibur episode, for God's sake). Overall, it doesn't look bad. The sound is ok, too. None of it is bad, but also not good enough to even remotely come close of saving anything in this show, so I won't even bother talking about it any further.\\n\\n\r\nWell, now you can downvote me to your heart's content.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online is a series that needs no introduction. To be quite frank, the first season spawned a lot of controversy with the adaptation. As a show taking place in an online realm, the series had a lot of potential but never really capitalized on them when it came down with the story and characters. Luckily, season 2 does freshen up a bit with some brand new storylines and characters. In particular, one of the first story arcs involves Kirito stepping forward into a new realm known as GGO. \r\nTo trace back a bit, the series is based off a light novel of thesame name written by Reki Kawahara. As a 2 cour series, this sequel focuses on three different arcs that are adapted from the light novel starting with GGO (stands for Gun Gale Online although the actual arc is titled Phantom Bullet). While the name seems unorthodox (guns in a show with a title called SWORD art online?), the arc actually deepens its mechanics in ways that are more profound than the original. The first few episodes highlight this by exposition and explaining thanks to a young girl Kirito meets in-game named Sinon. Regardless of how GGO functions, Kirito\u2019s main goal isn\u2019t to actually win but to find out a mysterious killer who seems to know him. Meanwhile, we learn more about Sinon and her fear of guns that leads her to make a goal of herself: to get over that fear. While the motivations of both characters are farfetched, there\u2019s a definite connection between the two as the game progresses.\\n\\n\r\nNow, introducing a brand new major character can be a hassle. Luckily though, Sinon isn\u2019t a weakling and she has the resolve to accomplish her goals. We also get flashbacks with concrete background information on her so nothing is left out to make viewers wonder her motivation. But the problem still remains with Kirito and his self-centered goals. While it doesn\u2019t necessarily ruin the arc, his goal of trying to hunt down a cyber-killer is nothing less than generic and similar to ALO (remember him trying to find a villain who tried to ruin his life and Asuna\u2019s?). Somehow though, the arc does manage to connect Kirito and Sinon despite some clingy and over-dramatic dialogues. A few episodes also stretches a bit to highlight how close they become in-game, despite them being enemies at one point. The ending of the arc is nonetheless predictable with Kirito playing a hero like the usual poster boy. The good news is that the GGO arc has great concept with its competitive angle. Competitors, weapons, and setting is visually adapted with elegance and astonishing features. Even the cyber-killer looks convincing enough to be called a menace with some cool gadgets to show off. And Kirito still remains very OP for someone new to the GGO world. When it comes to the action front though, GGO is where the game can be proud of itself. However, the antagonists from the arc is downright stereotypical, generic, and has a delusional purpose when the audience finds out the truth of their goals. Did I also mention predictable? SAO is a lot of things and the show never seems to escape that word.\\n\\n\r\nAs the series covers three different arcs, there\u2019s an intermission of sorts. Perhaps I\u2019m saying this wrong but the episodes taking place between GGO and Mother\u2019s Rosario (the other major arc to be adapted this season) feels like so. In this so called Calibur arc, the series returns to its generic setting of sword fighting in their online virtual realm. Kirito also gets a new sword to show off while his female companions seems to try to get their senpai to notice them. The arc is fairly standard and predictable that uses tricks from the old books. However, I do give praise to the choreography and action presented. Every character gets some kind of highlight with their skills. It\u2019s important to realize this since it also allows the viewers to see how far their skills developed since the first season. One other important element to notice in this arc is teamwork as the arc doesn\u2019t just give Kirito all the screen time. Even Klein, a character that some people might have forgotten from SAO, returns and gives the audience something to remember about. To me though, this seems like a preparation to what\u2019s to come soon; a way for the characters to stretch out their muscles and be like \u201cWe\u2019re ready to take on anything now\u201d.  Still, it lacked much depth or appeal with the story development.\\n\\n\r\nThe final arc of the season titled \u2018Mother Rosario\u2019 take up the remainder of the season. This arc has more of a slice of life and action-centric flick mixed in together. While it starts off slow, the arc gets to its point quickly once the mechanics and backgrounds are fleshed out. Asuna, a character that seemed almost completely pathetic during ALO, finally gets a chance to redeem herself in this arc. Rather than have her knight in shining armor (Kirito) do all the dirty work, she takes it upon herself to deal with a new conflict. Most importantly is how we see Asuna and her family is like, in particular with her mother. It shows a different side of her lifestyle beyond just spending time with her boyfriend. There\u2019s also a case of ideology that can be seen as controversial depending on whose side you agree with. But for what it\u2019s worth, the arc bounces between real life issues and in-game motivations; a direction that definitely outshines its first half. Not to mention, the action scenes are fairly well done with decent OST and coordination when it comes down to the actual dueling. The arc expands beyond just dueling though as we learn more about the new character (Yuuki) involved and what the audience may be carving for. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to visuals, it\u2019s fairly standard to see that SAO has touches of fantasy to it whether it would be the settings, characters, monsters, or whatever else you would typically see from an RPG game. Similar to season 1, A-1 Pictures adapts this based on the light novel designs. While fan service toned down a bit, there\u2019s also some zany gimmicks used such as gender bender and the animal characteristics. In spite of this, the GGO setting is one I found to be the most evolved on the visual front. Taking a closer look, the landscapes is desolate but rich with details for a perfect setting for battle. Not only that but characters are designed like they actually have the edge to fight as if their life is on the line; unlike the previous season where some character had cardboard box designs. Action and production values also strengthened with more stylized movements. However, most of the returning main characters still remains generic to their character designs with little change. They are unmemorable on physical standards although I do give some praise to Sinon\u2019s character.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is perhaps the weakest detail of the sequel. Nothing is really changed to the OST besides some minor adjustment while character voice mannerisms remains generally the same. While the first OP song is catchy, the remainder are mediocre that almost all sound the same. Most of the voice castings are also very standard with cheesy dialogues and overused words often to highlight some sense of emotional value; although real life conversation between some characters are worthwhile in particular with Asuna and her mother. I have some mixed feelings with Sinon\u2019s voice with that tomboy tone of hers. While she definitely has a sense of independence with that tone, it also seems bratty at times and feels cranky. Other times though, she can be appreciable when we see her as a person.\\n\\n\r\nAs a sequel, SAO II is definitely an improvement of the first season. It gave returning characters more development and screen-time on their own while also debuting new characters with their purpose. The first arc (GGO) highlights the mechanics of the game at a much better way than the first season while also has a meaningful purpose for Sinon. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t escape the usual \u201chero save the day\u2019 shenanigan or one dimensional villains with their mojo. But for what\u2019s worth, SAO\u2019s technical aspects shines more than what is expected when it comes to action. The Calibur and GGO arc are a testament of this while Mother Rosario also gets its moments with consistent choreography such as the dueling scenes. As the show did evolve, this sequel does have potential but don't expect a huge blockbuster.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up:\\n\\n\r\nThe story (GGO/Phantom Bullet: 6/10), (Calibur: 4/10), (Mother Rosario: 8/10 ) \u2013 each of them offers something new to the tables; some still suffers from generics and weakly developed tropes.\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10) \u2013 rather than Kirito become the host of his own show, we get development of Asuna and Yuuki, focus on Sinon, and also teamwork during the Calibur arc with each character getting some sort of spotlight\\n\r\nArtwork (8/10) \u2013 much better than season 1\\n\r\nSoundtrack (5/10) \u2013 repetitive and edgy along with second rated voice mannerisms\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10) \u2013 a fun adventure with different feelings of each arc\\n",

            "content": "It was Fall of 2012, and it almost seemed as though the world was in a bleak dark place of temper tantrums and violent outbursts. These were formed due to the nature of one simple questions: Is/Was Sword Art Online really that good or bad? Both sides had convincing arguments to their reasons for disliking or liking the show. But, ultimately, it has now become a staple of how every year, there is that one over-hyped show that defines anime of that year. Now it\u2019s 2014 and we finally have its sequel under the cheers and groans that look forward to or dread it.\r\nNow theone question remains amidst to its conclusion: Is Sword Art Online II better than Sword Art Online? The answer being: yes\u2026 kind of?\\n\\n\r\nMake no mistake I was, and am, of the camp that did not see the general appeal to Sword Art Online. With its sometimes flashy action sequences and brilliant score became a general mess of incoherent pacing, god awful 2nd half, and atrocious character development. Going forward with Sword Art Online II, all but one of these negatives that I had with its prequel are officially gone: character development. Of course, this is due to the fact that the prequel introduced these characters, albeit a short while, so now with the sequel, we are able to get to know these supporting characters a fair bit more than at first glance. This in turn makes them a little bit more relatable and likable in that scenario.\\n\\n\r\nNow there are characters that are new to the series that make their debut in this sequel. Sinon being the most notable and hyped character, it is poignant to see how she holds up as a character all her own. From her standout arc, Gun Gale Online, there are some positives to her that I can see clearly but other times I see plenty of negatives that keep her from being great. To put it more into perspective, Sinon has a likable presence and personality that is easily relatable, but her character arcs involving her psychological trauma is, suffice to say, hokey. Her unwillingness to shoot a gun, and yet is able to shoot at most enemies in the game with no hesitation whatsoever comes across as a bit counter-intuitive.\\n\\n\r\nThis hokey logic can be applied to the story at large. Although I will say that the story is, by far, the one thing that they didn\u2019t make even worse from the prequel. the hiccups there are in leaps of logic, and trust me there are some, most of them don\u2019t come near close to how badly they were beforehand. There is, of course, the unfortunate illness to the series where the 2nd half of Sword Art Online just becomes weaker as it goes along. Whereas in the previous season it was messy storytelling throughout the 2nd half, here its just flat out dull and meandering. All it is just an uneventful, sappy melodrama involving Asuna and one other character whose backstory I won\u2019t spoil. And really, the less Asuna in any season, the better.\\n\\n\r\nEven with the problematic story elements aside, there are certainly a few moments in Sword Art Online 2 that seem almost laughable in its attempt to be serious. One instance being one of the antagonists going on a full-on psychopathic meltdown on our hero Sinon that goes on for almost five minutes. I almost felt as though the voice actor couldn\u2019t do the script justice and tried his best to make it dire, but failed to do so. What went on was this overacting scene that felt way longer than it needed to be; at the same time it did give me one of the hilarious moments in anime this year.\\n\\n\r\nNow we have what many come for Sword Art Online for: the butts. Er, I mean, the animation and sound! Seriously though, unanimously, everyone can make the case that this series has really good production values. It does have some nice slick backgrounds with really nice lighting to make the world feel vibrant and alive. With this, we have the fighting scenes to go with it, which I seem to be of the minority that the fight scenes in Sword Art Online are pretty mediocre at best. Compared to other shounen shows that do their actions scenes well, here in Sword Art Online 2, most of the fight scenes are pretty tame. Hell, the first one had way more in terms of quality action and even then it didn\u2019t hold a candle to other better fighting shows out there. This entails from how the characters\u2019 actions seem very disjointed and their movements feel rough around the edges at certain points. Nevertheless, when it\u2019s not going for fast paced action, the art and animation is quite stunning for the eyes to see and gander at.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be far-pressed to express some sort of relief that the sequel brought us something that\u2019s not unwatchable, even if it still wasn\u2019t a great final product in the long run. For what it\u2019s worth, I could see myself watching this again; at least, insomuch how I would prefer it over the prequel, if I had a choice. It still can\u2019t be given a passing grade from the story\u2019s pacing and writing problems that lower its quality amongst other shows that deserve it more. As if that wasn\u2019t enough for over-hyped shows to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: C-\\n",

            "content": "It's my first review here and english isn't my native so, forgive me if I make some mistake!\r\nLet me start this review by saying, yes, your eyes aren't fooling you, i rated this as a 9, i'll explain my reasons below, it's going to be long but i'll add a tl;dr version at the end of every 'arc'.\r\nSAO is a series that doesn't need any introduction, its really popular, loved and hated, but, before you watch SAO2, i need to tell you something so you can enjoy it to its full potential, first, SAO as a whole is NOT about action nor romance, it doeshave some, but it's not the main theme, not even in SAO1, not in SAO2, not even in the hopefully coming SAO3.\\n\\n\r\nMade my point clear, i'll start the review, which i'm going to split in 3 arcs, just like the anime.\\n\\n\r\nPhantom Bullet Arc (eps 1 - 14) \\n\\n\r\nStory: 9 \\n\\n\r\nSAO2 starts where SAO1 left us, Kirito and Asuna going to the SAO survivor school together, it's been a year since SAO incident and VRMMOs are still really popular thanks to The Seed, which made possible to create a bunch of new games. One day, Seijiro Kikuoka from the \"VR division\" asks Kirito to investigate about a rumour that was spreaded in a game called Gun Gale Online, where, if you get shot by a mysterious avatar with a black gun, you will die irl, Kirito is reluctant at first, but gets curious about it and ends up accepting the job. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9.\\n\\n\r\nAs usual, SAO's visual are AMAZING, not much to say here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is really fitting, from the OP to the ED, you can get an idea of the characters, their struggles and their wishes. The OST, as usual, amazing, one of Kajiura's best jobs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, we have our so-loved and so-hated MC, Kirito, getting some development and action here and there, no need to say much about him. \\n\\n\r\nThen, we have Sinon/Shino, the female lead in this arc (no, Asuna doesn't appear much) one of the best snipers in GGO nicknamed \"Icy Sniper\" because of her calm personality during battles. She wants to win the Bullet of Bullets, GGO tournament. As a character, she is really well done, she has a backstory, development and courage.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason my enjoyment is low compared to the rest is, the butt shots, this seriously ruined some scenes in this arc, Sinon's ass was focused A LOT in 14 episodes, even during serious scenes, made the anime kinda annoying.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.6, compared to the 9 i gave this in LN, all thanks to ass shots, A-1, you're the real MVP.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: This is really good, the pace is the opposite to SAO1, it's slow and takes its time to develop but be prepared to see Sinon's ass A LOT, music and animation are awesome as usual, if you like Psychology, VR and Games, you should try this, if you are expecting a lot of action, you should go somewhere else.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nCaliber Arc (eps. 15 - 17)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6.\\n\\n\r\nThis mini-arc is a Side Story, shows the entire group doing a quest to get the Legendary Sword Excalibur, it also explains the Cardinal System, really needed for possible SAO3.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9.\\n\\n\r\nNew OP by Haruka Tomatsu and ED by LiSA, loved both of them, really good as usual, the OST really fitting for the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8. \\n\\n\r\nAs usual, amazing. The battles are nice, the magic effects are done wonderfully.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7.\\n\\n\r\nIt's the whole group, there is not really a need to explain all of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nWell, it's a side story, it had fun, action, some little romance here and there, nothing so impressive, but good nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 compared to the 7.3 in the LN, well, some scenes were changed, but still solid.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Not impressive, but its fine for a laugh or killing time, sound is awesome, explains Cardinal System for better understanding of next arcs.\\n\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nMother's Rosario Arc (eps. 18 - 24)\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, we get to the best arc this season, Mother's Rosario. In ALO, there's a rumour about a player nicknamed as \"Absolute Sword\" who has been doing a lot of duels in some island. With 69 wins at row, this player catches Asuna's attention, specially after hearing that Kirito lost against him. Who is this player? Why is he doing so much duels? Prepare for the feels.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10.\\n\\n\r\nAmazing, nuff said.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10.\\n\\n\r\nTHIS soundtrack, same OP by Haruka Tomatsu but new sequence, new ED by LiSA called Shirushi, both songs are amazing, specially the ED with all the feels, OST is great also.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, we have Asuna, our so-loved and so-hated female MC. In this arc, we see some development for her, we can also see how is her relationship with her family, which will lead to a trip full of feels.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have, Zekken, probably, one of the BEST SAO characters, even in the LN, strong, fast, this player holds a big secret which is going to send you to feeladelphia. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10.\\n\\n\r\nI loved everything about this arc, was adapted really well, the scenes, soundtracks and everything portrayed its meaning perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: An arc full of feels, a new player with 69 wins at row, one of those against Kirito, this player will have some serious effect not only in the story, but Asuna as well, it's really worth watching.\\n\\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nOverall for SAO2: 8.6, rounded up to 9. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are a SAO fan, you could like this, even if youre a hater, the story is really well written, most of the failures are from animation itself. But don't expect so much action, its slow paced, but its really worth a shot.",

            "content": "It is time to review a story that never should have taken place. By any measure of realism and sensible writing, the show would have ended after their escape from SAO, the technology would have been banned in the wake of the public outrage, and there would be no need for further walls of snarky reviews at MAL.\r\nBut there was more money to be made, and what are realism and sensible writing compared to that? So here we are then.\r\nWhen reviewing season 1, I implied that the second arc was a cashcow, and I feel the same applies here. It is a thinly veiled attemptto stretch out the SAO franchise for quick cash, a calculated money-grabbing venture. A part of what makes it that way is that these new arcs don't contribute much to the overall narrative. It's just adventuring for the sake of adventuring. It doesn't help that each arc is fairly self-contained, with a jarring transition from one arc to another. Now, I'm not against multiple plotlines but here's an idea: try developing them simultaneously, side by side. It would also improve the show from a world-building perspective, creating a stronger illusion of an actual world instead of this clip show of the protagonist's adventures. \\n\\n\r\nThis season is divided into no fewer than three arcs, so I'll have to go through them one by one.\\n\\n\r\nGun Gale Online arc: 3\\n\\n\r\nThis is the longest of the three arcs, taking up 14 of 24 episodes, so it stands to reason that the most effort should have gone into this. Predictably enough, this is not the case and it drops the ball right at the starting line. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise is that players of a virtual reality MMO, Gun Gale Online, are dying in real life after being shot by a magic gun called the Death Gun. This gun is wielded by the creatively named character, Death Gun, who is subtly dressed in robes and a steel mask so that nobody could figure out he's the bad guy. How are the authorities going to investigate this? Track Death Gun's IP address? No, of course not. That would be stupid. Obviously the only way to solve this problem is to call Kirito. \\n\\n\r\nFor the record, there is an in-universe reason why they can't track Death Gun down: the people running the game are apparently refusing to hand over his player info. Furthermore, they are in the United States, and obviously the American authorities won't ask them or simply place them under surveillance because... shut up. Seriously, if you're going to use that as an excuse, at least place them into a third-world country or something. After the SAO and ALO incidents, I can't believe for a second that there'd be such a lack of government oversight. If all else failed, they could simply threaten to launch a negative media campaign over the deaths to force the GGO staff to hand over the data or go bankrupt.\\n\\n\r\nThis is something I mentioned in my SAO review, but I cannot emphasize it enough. After the SAO disaster and the consequential mass hysteria, it would have only been realistic to ban the technology. It doesn't matter if the new hardware is safer. People just wouldn't trust it. After all, the old death trap passed safety inspections with flying colors too. (I'm being generous here and assuming they actually have safety inspections in the SAO-verse. I could be wrong.) Add to that the ALO incident where government safeguards failed again, and this lack of regulation and oversight becomes all the more ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\n*cough*\\n\r\nAnyway, Kirito is asked to put his life on the line in an MMO again. You'd think he would refuse after spending two years trapped in a life-and-death struggle, but we wouldn't have a new story otherwise, so after brief hesitation he jumps right in. He logs into GGO without any kind of prior experience of the game or any weapons or a pool of funding. He also converted his old account, so he is going with his famous standard username. These government-funded covert operations sure are overrated. \\n\\n\r\nSo why did they ask Kirito who has no experience in this game, especially given how it's played by professionals for cash prizes? The reason is simply that he can be trusted because of his earlier involvement. ...Okay, I might buy that if Kirito was just going to play casually, but instead he joins the tournament where all the top players gather. Realistically he'd be eliminated right away, but this is Kirito we're talking about, so he's immediately better at it than the people who make their living out of it. This is because he has the good sense to bring a sword into a gun fight, and by sword I mean lightsaber, complete with Star Wars sound effects. It's only fitting that he has godlike reflexes and can deflect bullets with his sword, up to slicing them in half in midair. In a word, he is a Jedi. \\n\\n\r\nI mentioned gun fights because GGO resembles a first-person shooter. The strange part is that you can see bullet lines to predict enemy shots, with the exception of a sniper's first shot, which is an odd design choice to say the least, or rather it ruins the whole thing. But Kirito has figured out it can be faster to just look where the gun is pointing or follow their eyes. Why nobody else has realized this simple fact is beyond me, but that's apparently how it is. It is this insight, along with his overpowered reflexes, that allows him to easily beat an allegedly impossible minigame no one else could. \\n\\n\r\nHe also encounters a female sniper called Sinon who suffers from PTSD and is morbidly afraid of guns in real life. Which is naturally why she's playing a gun-themed MMO as a form of therapy and is completely fine with guns within the game. Probably not the first line of therapy I'd recommend. She is also frequently used for fanservice, which shouldn't really surprise anyone. \\n\\n\r\nIf that wasn't bad enough, Kirito is pretending to be a girl to gain Sinon's trust and apparently to troll random male players. This gives an opportunity for additional fanservice in case Sinon isn't enough. I wonder if he even takes his girlfriend and adopted daughter seriously if he's fine flirting with not only women but also men. I'm also going to be generous here and assume nobody can use an avatar of the opposite gender in these MMOs because otherwise people assuming that he is female in real life is just ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nThe lack of continuity becomes apparent when a raid against player-killers in SAO (by which I mean the original Aincrad arc) is retconned into the story instead of presenting it during season one. Kirito also suddenly gets PTSD over the events of SAO, despite never having problems before. Thankfully he can trivially overcome these problems, and his heroic bravery also inspires Sinon. Yes, even Kirito's flaws are portrayed as strengths.\\n\\n\r\nEventually Kirito figures out the culprit's MO by some guesswork and proceeds with a plan to obtain his name that shouldn't really work. But it does. I also think it might have been a good idea to contact the authorities beforehand and send surveillance teams and security to the relevant locations, but we've seen how well-prepared this covert operation has been, so maybe it wouldn't have made a difference. GGO also displays its high safety standards with the lack of manual logout during tournaments, which sounds damn ominous after the SAO massacre. \\n\\n\r\nThis is followed by infodumping the villain's backstory at the last minute. Without going into spoilers, the ultimate reveals are not worth it. Death Gun's identity is extremely anticlimactic, his method of killing is very situational, and his motivation can barely be called one. There is also the obligatory attempted rape scene to establish that the villain is in fact evil. You can't trust the audience to figure that one out on their own.\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing. In his spare time Kirito is developing revolutionary virtual reality applications. Sounds like a bit of a stretch for him alone compared to, say, a massive research team, but this is Kirito after all.\\n\\n\r\nExcaliber arc: 3\\n\\n\r\nKirito and co. must take on a new quest to save the world of Alheim Online from a dreadful menace: their save files getting erased!\\n\\n\r\nSo, yeah, they are questing in ALO for three episodes, and if they lose, nobody will die, but game data will be erased. How is this a problem, you ask? Well... there are no backups. It uses a core program derived from SAO whose functionality isn't fully known. Of course the staff is also unavailable because they are all on holiday. \\n\\n\r\nSo let me get this straight. This is an MMO where\\n\r\n- the game may arbitrarily decide to have its map implode,\\n\r\n- there are no real backups of the game world,\\n\r\n- the staff hasn't bothered to check the system thoroughly enough to realize this possibility, or simply doesn't care, and\\n\r\n- the GMs aren't always on call, even though this game uses the same software as the infamous SAO.\\n\\n\r\nI can picture it now.\\n\r\n\"Hey, something strange is going on. I'm trapped inside the game and can't log out.\"\\n\r\n\"It is currently outside support hours. Please send your query during regular support hours.\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd, yes, I know that they don't understand how it works because they didn't build it from a scratch. But here's the thing: if you don't understand how it works, don't use it! Especially if it's software from an infamous death trap known to be full of surprises. I mentioned earlier that the technology would have probably been banned, but if it isn't even fully understood, I'd say banning it might have been a good idea.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual questing is pretty much just beating up some bosses and other enemies in a dungeon and short interaction with NPCs. Actually, there are some newly introduced AI characters (I suppose the threat is legit to them), but they don't get much screentime, so it's hard to develop any connection. I don't dislike the idea of having people do normal MMOing, but it would work better if the show was about that from the start. If you have death games, murder investigations and so on, a few random episodes of normal MMOing won't fit in. It is little more than a filler arc. And while you're at it, flesh out the game mechanics more. Watching a Let's Play usually works better if you understand more firmly what's going on. \\n\\n\r\nMother's Rosario arc: 5\\n\\n\r\nThe last seven episodes decide to go with \"the feels\" tactics and appeal to emotion. It's actually a familiar idea from the first season: the show introduces some new characters and, guess what, pretty soon some tragic things happen to them. Unfortunately, I found it hard to become emotionally invested in people who have only been introduced a moment earlier, especially if it's obvious they only exist for this purpose. You see, the tragedy is an incredibly unlikely stroke of bad luck, almost implausible, which makes it look very plot-convenient. The show tries to make them more meaningful by presenting deep friendship between the old and new characters in a short timeframe. It succeeds halfway, but it's still bordering on implausibly fast. At least the situation provides an application for virtual MMO technology, but it could have been handled in a way that looks less convenient.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and the main character for this arc is Asuna, which is a refreshing change from Kirito, I suppose. She is a bit less overpowered too, if only a bit, not that fighting is really the focus here. Still, we do get to see a moment where Kirito single-handedly overpowers several dozen players, but at least it's only once.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also another subplot in which Asuna and her mother talk about their relationship and her future career. And by future career I mean marriage prospects, for which Kirito is unsuitable simply because he isn't loaded with enough cash. In case anyone hasn't figured out by this description, or by season one's Alfheim arc for that matter, Asuna has absolutely terrible parents who care about her daughter's status and bank account more than her free will and emotional well-being. I don't get how Asuna can even be on speaking terms with them after the events of season one, but apparently this is the case, if only barely. Still, the interaction is believable enough and manages to produce some much needed character growth, making it one of the better parts of the season.\\n\\n\r\nStory overall: 4\\n\r\nIt may not be as off-the-rails as season one, and there aren't any ridiculous timeskips, but instead we get a fragmented season with little connection between the arcs. And the arcs themselves have their own problems.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\\n\r\nKirito: The man himself, as overpowered as ever. As far as his personality goes, it's hard to detect any notable growth. The PTSD aspect was easily overcome and it seemed artificial considering that he had never had these problems before. But the real problem is the same as before: he never has anything interesting to say. I mean, really: it's just dull heroic lines or generic exposition. No wit, no eloquence, no charisma. Kirito is an all-out action hero, but that's all he is. He is no strategist, and he isn't much use for conversation either. \\n\\n\r\nAsuna: Finally gets out of Kirito's shadow and gets some development that makes her more of an actual human being. We learn more about her family, the problems in her personal life, and so on. By the way, there isn't any real development in her relationship with Kirito, but how could there be given how it's portrayed as nigh perfect from the start?\\n\\n\r\nAsuna's mother: Not the kind of mother I'd like to have, but I can see people like this existing. She does get fleshed out a bit though.\\n\\n\r\nSinon: The PTSD aspect is handled so unrealistically it's hard to take it seriously, and its resolution is almost arbitrary. After the first arc she becomes irrelevant, much like most of the side characters in this show.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Gun: Could have been handled better, to say the least, and by that I mean both his virtual and real-world self. For starters, how about giving him some better motivation? They say that the villain makes the plot, but here there is almost neither.\\n\\n\r\nYuuki: She receives barely enough screentime. It's far more than most of the side characters, but that isn't saying much. Her backstory and role in the plot feel too convenient.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the old cast: Barely exist. They get to appear a few times, but they don't really do much. If there is anything worth mentioning, it's that Klein not getting a girlfriend has become a running gag.\\n\\n\r\nTechnically there are a few that I didn't mention, such as Sinon's friend who only exists to be inferior to Kirito in Sinon's eyes, and the government official guy who just stands there unable to get anything done while Kirito saves the day. But that is already being generous. You would think that a show about MMOs would do some world-building by introducing a greater number of characters and portraying their relationships, but nope. Only a few other characters are meaningful to the plot. Kirito himself hogs much of the screentime, though it isn't nearly as ridiculous as in season one.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals: 8\\n\r\nAgain, this must be where they spent the cash. The visuals look great. GGO in particular has very nice backgrounds, ranging from massive steampunk cities to postapocalyptic ruins and wastelands. ALO may feel like a repetition of season one, but the execution is good nonetheless. The fanservice is probably less impressive, but what else is new? The second and third openings have pretty great visual design and the last ending likewise.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nGets the job done pretty well. The voice acting, opening and ending songs, and the soundtrack are all good enough.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nThe slower pacing somewhat hurts the possible \"so bad it's good\" effect compared to last season. If we're talking about legit enjoyment, Mother's Rosario takes the lead by far.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nKirito continues his epic struggle to trivially beat everyone in his path, even if it doesn't take all season this time. It made some money though, so who am I to judge?",

            "content": "When Sword Art Online II appears, a beam of light peep out in my mind and hope that the sequel able to cover all its mistakes.\r\nBut again, my hope was shattered into a dust\r\nBased off the light novel written by Reki Kawahara, Sword Art Online II is a sequel of Sword Art Online. The series started after the Alfheim Online's Arc, in a new game called Gun Gale Online, where a string of deaths begins occurring in the game. Our main character, Kirigaya Kazuto is assigned to enter Gun Gale Online to investigate the cause of the deaths. \r\nThe story is divided into 3 arcs:Gun Gale Online (or Phantom Bullet), Calibur, and Mother's Rosario.\\n\\n\r\nThe story adapts the same conflict of the previous series (the point of murdered inside a game), but in a different way. The story offers us a great action and fierce battle scene. At the Gun Gale Online arc, the story has a decent orientation and still manage to bring the main idea of the story itself. But after the GGO arc, I found out that Sword Art Online once again failed to live up to my expectation. After the GGO arc, there is a dull arc (Calibur Arc) where the fillers leak out from all directions. Into the last arc, Mother's Rosario is an arc that transforms this into a drama series in a bad way. They force up a few episodes into tears while forgetting the main story itself, and causes a heavy damage to the ending itself. Again, SAO is failed to revive itself.\\n\\n\r\nLet's forget the story section and move to the animation section. The animation is done by A-1 Picture, they bring a wonderful and attractive animation which became the main reason to watch this anime. And became the diamond itself within the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound section, the seiyuu did fairly well when bringing such character to the screen. The 1st opening theme \"Ignite\" sung by Eir Aoi really describe the GGO arc very well, the other soundtracks are decent.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, Sword Art Online II does the same poor development on the character section. Our new female lead, Sinon is the only character that having an interesting and meaningful development. While our male lead, Kirigaya Kazuto is far behind our new female lead, same as our old female lead, Yuuki Asuna. The Kirito's harem and his friend are same too. Other characters besides Sinon are not having a single development at all. Also, the main antagonist of the GGO arc had a relatively weak motive. \\n\\n\r\nI found Sword Art Online II shine brightly in my enjoyment at the Gun Gale Online arc. After that, SAO doesn't have anything in its storage, just a dull and fair entertainment in our glance. It is fairly recommended to the big fans of the SAO series. Overall, I think SAO once again fell into the darkness.....\\n\\n",

            "content": "-- Overview --\r\nThe SAO franchise, and particularly SAO II, is a very controversial series. It is disliked by a lot of people, and the complaints are quite damning. For these people the story seems disjointed, the characters make decisions that don\u2019t make sense, and the pacing is all over the place. Those that make such complaints are happy to describe how they think they would act if they ever found themselves in a similar situation. These people generally have something in common. They have either never played any MMOs, or played them very casually. In this I am sorry because they will likely never understandthe depth that this anime has to offer beyond a few nice pictures and pretty songs. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime, and the entire series, is a love story for and to the MMO players, made by MMO players. That means many, if not most, of the intricacies of the story and characters, and indeed even much of the message fails to come through if you do not have fairly extensive hardcore experience in MMOs. This is unfortunate, because the depth of this anime is on par with some of the greatest stories I have seen in this medium. To make matters more difficult, the story requires a very good understanding of the plot and themes of the first SAO to completely appreciate. It is simply not be well suited for casual watching; little details of vital importance flash for short seconds, often in completely unexpected scenes. Characters do things that are easy to misinterpret unless you can understand out what\u2019s going on in their heads. The relation between the various events are rarely spelled out, leaving you to fill in some of the blanks yourself. All of these are things that make sense if you remember the source material is a book. The anime is very true to the book, and thus it should be watched with the same amount of attention and tolerance that you would put into reading a good novel. \\n\\n\r\nIf you can accept the level of engagement required, SAO II is an absolutely wonderful experience. It paints an accurate picture of what those of the mid-2010s thought life would be like in 2025. It covers some of the most important questions that you could ask. It tells a story that knows that it's better to show, rather than tell. Best of all, it does so in a package of impeccable artistic quality; sporting both gorgeous art, and very atmospheric music. This is quite critical for the story. Due to the absence of a novel\u2019s narrator, the series has a penchant of dropping into the point of view of the various characters. This is often the only gateway the viewers have into the mind of the characters. It also helps justify a good bit of fan service; such is the mind of a teenage boy.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem that I could really complain about were the occasional inconsistencies across scenes; spelling mistakes, characters in strange positions, and minor bits of continuity strangeness that you might notice on the second or third watch-through.\\n\\n\r\nIt's a series that meant to mature and bloom as you understand it better, and in doing what it set out to do it is an absolute masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\n[Spoilers to follow]\\n\\n\r\n-- Story --\\n\\n\r\nAny discussion of SAO II must inevitable be prefaced with a discussion of SAO. This is a plot heavy sequel of a plot heavy anime, and it's simply not possible to understand the various character study arcs without some understanding of the message SAO was trying to deliver. At the core of SAO was the question of \"What is Reality?\" Eventually it arrived at the answer that your reality was what you made it, within balance and reason. In the process it followed the daily lives of a few perfectly normal people as they went through a dangerous world they could never have been prepared for. It let you see into the lives of two kids that suddenly had to fight for their lives, and mature long before they should have had to. Most of all, it did so in a perfectly believable way that any MMO player can easily relate to. \\n\\n\r\nSAO set the stage for SAO II by introducing the characters and the experiences that brought them together, and then gave way to SAO II to truly study what this meant for each of them. SAO asks, attempts to resolve the question of \"What is reality?\" Then SAO II picks up this theme by asking the only question that hopes to achieve the same scope and scale. This anime is a thematic study of the question \u201cWhat does it mean to live and to die?\\n\\n\r\nEverything in SAO II is questioning the meaning of life and death, particularly when it comes to this world that the characters have accepted as being equal to their own reality. Everything from the first arc, which blurs the line between death in the real world, and the virtual, to the last which offers a bittersweet glance at what it means to live life to the fullest. Even the middle arc offers an interesting perspective on how alive the world the characters inhabit really is, and how deep the attachment to this world runs in each of them. Weaving throughout all these themes, the series manages to include a heartfelt romance, a good look at various cultural idiosyncrasies of Japan, entertaining fight scenes, and a variety of worlds each totally different from the other.\\n\\n\r\n-- Characters --\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were probably the strongest point of the series, assuming that one took the time to really empathize with them. \\n\\n\r\nKirito is a normal teenage boy, with normal teenage interests. He\u2019s fascinated with VR technology, and has dreams of realizing his own ideas developed over years in this sort of game. Behind this mask you have a boy who was forced to become a soldier, and bear the burden of thousands. He\u2019s a person that wants to live his life in peace, but is willing to help those in need. He shows a deep attachment to the world that became his home; the world where he met his love. He acts like a person forged on the battlefield; when under pressure he takes charge, and when he is safer he understand the need to rest and plan. He actually shows traces of PTSD, with clear hints that he\u2019s spent quite a while dealing with these matters, either alone or with professional help. He\u2019s also a bit of a pervert, but what would anyone expect. The book makes it quite clear that he an Asuna share a rather intimate relationship. \\n\\n\r\nAlong with Kirito the first season introduces Sinon, who is a bit of a \"foil\" that the story uses to help compare and contrast with Kirito. Like him she had killed someone, but unlike him she never had the experience to deal with the result. Instead she built herself a nearly schizophrenic persona of a quiet sniper running with the rough and tumble gunmen of the world of GGO. As the first arc progresses we get to see as she slowly manages to put her trauma behind her, and recaptures the more friendly and outgoing persona that you might expect of a girl that age. She does fall off in importance once the first arc is over, being relegated to an minor role for the rest of the series. This makes sense when you consider that the Sinon is Kirito\u2019s friend, while the second major arc focuses on Asuna.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings us Asuna, arguably one of the most interesting characters in the series. While we are only treated to hints of her problems during the first half of the series, the second half does an amazing job of telling her story. Here we learn that Asuna is facing some serious challenges of her own. Despite her normally happy appearance we get to see that Asuna is troubled by her position in society. As the daughter of influential people she is faced with certain expectations that run counter to what she wants from her life. However, her upbringing, and the cultural gulf between her and her mother makes solving those problems quite difficult. Despite all of that she manages to put on a strong face for all of her friends, even when she finds out that the first female friend to truly understand her is a young girl in the terminal stages of AIDS. In this she acts as a pillar of stability for those around her, protecting her family above all else.\\n\\n\r\nYuuki is a mirror into Asuna\u2019s character in the same way that Sinon was a mirror of Kirito in the first Arc. Like Asuna, Yuuki strives to protect her friends in the face of insurmountable circumstances. She too puts on a mask of the happy, cheerful girl, even when her reality is a broken body constantly on the verge of death. She works hard, and does her best so that the technology which let her live the last of her days in happiness can help others. With her strength of will she even helps Asuna find the strengths to confront her mother, passes on a legacy that will live on in the VR world, and receives a true champion\u2019s farewell. \\n\\n\r\nThen, we have the \"harem.\" Despite what some chose to see, this is actually a fairly normal a group of friends who have formed a bond akin to family with this alternate world. These are people that lived, bled, killed, and faced sorrow with the main characters. Some of them have traces of an old crush on Kirito, though that is rarely played out beyond exasperated sighs as they watch Kirito and Asuna cuddle in the distance. Nevertheless, all of the members of this group are well fleshed out characters with interesting personalities and unexpected depth. For the most part these characters add a softer, often more comedic edge to the interaction. That\u2019s not too say that they lack serious moments, but unfortunately they simply cannot get the serious treatment that the main characters enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I cannot let the review go without bringing up Yui. The character that gets the most complaints for not being human enough, and for her role as a silly diversion. Ironically, Yui is the one that best exhibits what she was meant to; she is an AI, and behaves herself in a consistent fashion with the rules of the universe that we are introduced to. There are even hints to a deeply technical side of her that is very close to Kirito, and helps him in his day to day life. Unfortunately we rarely see her outside a tentative support role, though I believe there is a lot of potential there had the show dared to explore it further.\\n\\n\r\n-- Art & Sound --\\n\\n\r\nThere is little to say here. The both the artistic and audio direction were top notch. The studios selected were clearly picked for their ability to deliver a complete package, and I believe they managed to catch the mood and the theme of the series perfectly. The music was quite amazing and thematic, connecting well with the ideas of the show. It\u2019s truly difficult to match the melancholy feeling that the last ending theme evoked when you realize that the song was something shared by Asuna and Yuuki, as the last notes fade out over Yuuki\u2019s memorial. \\n\\n\r\nI will take some issues with the character animations, particularly during dialog. While the backgrounds are always utterly amazing, the characters are often too still, and too simple to really do justice to the backdrop. It\u2019s something that\u2019s fairly easy to forgive given the consistent style, and exciting battle scenes, but it still stands out at times. \\n\\n\r\n-- Enjoyment --\\n\\n\r\nIf you are willing to invest some time into this show, and truly dive into the world then it offers an experience few series can match. If you can relate to the experience of farming rare items for weeks on end, of gathering materials for a rare recipe, of spending weeks and months on a new boss, and of meeting friends that will last a lifetime through the screen of the game, this series will speak to you like no other. If you are willing to treat this series with the care and attention given to a book, then you will find an involving and captivating plot. If you can look beneath the surface you will find a deep world full of wonderful characters. Unfortunately if you are just looking for a normal anime experience to fill out your list then you might not even see a glimpse of any of the things I speak of. \\n\\n\r\n-- Overall \u2013\\n\\n\r\nThis series completes the package that is SAO. Even if we never see SAO III, I will hold it in my heart as one of the greats. \\n\\n\r\nI would be a fool to claim that this is a show for everyone. Clearly it will not appeal to every person that picks it up. However, I do not believe that this is a shortcoming of any sort. I simply do not see how it could have delivered such an experienced to a wider audience, at least in anime form. Maybe more people might understand it if read from the book, but that\u2019s not really here or there in an anime review. In short, when seen by the target audience, this show offers an experience that matches and even exceeds some of the very best masterpieces of the past decade. For that I give it 10/10, and to those that understand why I raise my glass. May we meet again, and share the stories of the worlds that we have seen.\\n",

You know, I hear alot of fanboys say that the second season is much better than the first, but I say they're dead wrong. When I started watching this season, I told myself that I'm not taking anyone's word for it and will let the show speak for itself. If you ask me, Sword Art Online should've ended after, y'know, Sword Art Online. Even if Aincrad was a terrible arc, it would've ended with at least some dignity. But nope, Fairy Dance just had to drive whatever dignity it had into the ground.\r\nThe second season ofSword Art Online is split into three arcs: The first arc is Phantom Bullet (Episodes 1 through 14). One year after the SAO incident, there have been killings of players in real life in a game called Gun Gale Online by someone by the name of \"Death Gun\". Since it's been proven that it's no longer possible to kill someone through the game technology, Kazuto is brought in to log into GGO, and enter the Battle of Bullets tournament to get to the bottom of Death Gun.\\n\\n\r\nHow in the world did anyone say this arc was better than the first two arcs? If anything it's just as bad.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, no matter what anyone tries to say, Kirito is not smart, complex, or badass character. He's a Gary Stu, a wish-fulfillment blank slate meant for basement-dwelling loser teenage males to insert themselves onto and a walking example of the writer's complete and utter laziness. His GGO avatar looking female is absolutely stupid and completely pointless. I mean, I can understand the G.I.R.L. thing because I've done it once before, even though it's stated that it's more of an effeminate looking male appearance. But here's the thing: The show plays it up as if he is a female. I don't need to hear Kirito do a dumb girly voice. And even the process on HOW he gets that avatar is stupid. First of all, no MMO would ever give a player predetermined avatars. Secondly, out of all of them, Kirito just so happens to get one of the rarest ones.\\n\\n\r\nAnd let's talk about how he's the only one out of how many players to use a lightsaber. (Yeah, I'm calling it a lightsaber because that's exactly what it is. It even makes the same sounds effects.) And yet the show passes that off as \"if it can be bought, it can be used.\" But the deal is no one in GGO ever thought to use it. It's basically there waiting for Kirito alone to use it. In fact, the fact that no one but Kirito can, because he's Kirito, proves the writing is too lazy to make him learn anything. Yeah, fans say he's not a Gary Stu. Everything I've seen out of this show makes me think otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nNow Shino Asada/Sinon, the female lead of the Phantom Bullet arc. Her story is that, at the tender age of 11, she was traumatized by shooting a bank robber out of self-defense, and as a result, gained a phobia of guns and anything shaped like one, such as a gun hand gesture. So she plays GGO as a form of exposure therapy to help her fight her fear of guns.\\n\\n\r\nSo what happens to Sinon's character? Take a wild guess. Here's a hint: It's starts with \"K\" and ends with \"irito.\"\\n\\n\r\nGod, I can't stand her. I hate her as much as I do Asuna, and that's a big low considering Asuna's one of the show's worst characters. She started out as a decent character with a decent backstory, but then she turned into an useless crybaby whose only purpose is to shove her pancake butt to the audience. If you're gonna do that, A-1, at least give her a nice one. And it made me discover what's wrong with females in this show, and why they're only meant to inevitably become part of Kirito's harem. This is an rundown on how female characters are \"written\" here: \"Here's a potentially good character. I'll spend an episode or two showing you why you should like her. Now that she has your interest, watch as I completely toss out everything you liked about her and make her dependent on Kirito-kun while I laugh at your face, you goddamn idiot.\" It happened to Asuna, it happened to Suguha, and it happened to Sinon. Did you expect anything less? Like I said before, there is no point in liking any female character in this show, let alone Sinon, if they're just gonna get their character trampled on by Kirito.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yeah, I do understand how her idea of exposure therapy works. \"I've been traumatized by gun violence and by playing Online First-Person Shooters, where I'm surrounded by guns will help me cope with it in real life.\" Here's the problem with that: First, even if I can buy the exposure therapy idea, you don't relive into the very thing that caused the trauma. Second, the exposure therapy idea ultimately goes nowhere. Kirito does everything for her and she accomplishes nothing on her own. Likewise, they pretty much retconned Kirito's PTSD from SAO just so he can out-PTSD her to make her weak and useless. Her character becomes so dependent on Kirito that it's sickening. You'd think that Sinon, having experienced the same kinds of things Kirito had, would be the one to help Kirito cope and eventually they help each other cope with their respective fears. But since this is SAO, Sinon's only real worth is her pancake butt. Whatever dialogue she has with Kirito become awkward and pointless when she's essentially riding his D.\\n\\n\r\nAnd after all is said and done, Both Kirito and Sinon's PTSD magically disappears Heck, their PTSD turns on and off whenever the plot needs it to. If the writers actually knew a thing or two about how PTSD works, then they would've known that no matter how much therapy is taken, PTSD is stuck with you for the rest of your life and all it takes is the trigger to bring it back. I'll go into more detail about how this show and its writing has no respect for this stuff later in the review, but what Sinon really has here is a much different form of PTSD: Plot-Triggered Stupidity Disorder.\\n\\n\r\nNow the villain, Death Gun, or as I like to call him \"edgy Darth Vader knockoff\", and yes, he basically is. The dude is a walking Lucasfilms lawsuit waiting to happen. I mean, nothing's original, but SAO is so unoriginal that I feel it rips everything off. The guy does not feel threatening at all. He's basically evil for the sake of evil and his attempt at villainy falls flat.\\n\\n\r\nWe learn that Death Gun is made of at least three persons: Shouichi Shinkawa/Red-Eyed XaXa, his younger brother Kyouji/Spegiel, and his partner Atsushi Kanemoto/Johnny Black. XaXa is logged into GGO as Death Gun, while Kyouji or Johnny Black breaks into a victim's home and injects a lethal drug, while at the same time watching a livestream to perfectly time it so that it looks like Death Gun killed a person in-game. Kirito figures ALL of this out without any prior knowledge. He doesn't take random guesses; he is 100% on the mark. He can't log out during the GGO tournament (because the developers forgot how much of a safety hazard not being able to log out), and he's not in contact with anyone in the real world outside, so his figuring this out comes off as complete convenience.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to make matters worse, Kyouji being one part of Death Gun was made so blatantly obvious in the third episode that I was more concerned on what dumb motivation he had for killing. And even worse, we have him attempt to rape Shino. Yeah, because murder-suicide is already bad enough, we gotta pull the rape card. Because it worked SO well the last time. And even if Shino was able to fight off Kyouji for awhile, in the end, once again, it's Kazuto that bails her out. It's a problem when this show constatly uses attempted rape as cheap shock. It's also a problem when people actually and seriously attempt to defend such idiotic, offensive, and effortless excuse of writing, which, if you ask me, only makes them just as bad since they allow this garbage to get away with murder. If this had only happened in Fairy Dance, then I would've thought nothing of it outside that particular moment. But nope! Now that SAO has trivialized sexual assault on two consecutive occasions, I have every reason to assume that any subsequent villains will eventually attempt to rape a girl at some point in their time, because we gotta follow the \"all bad guys are rapists\" cliche so that big, strong hero Kirito can save the girl. Like I said before, ff you can't write attempted rape without any real meaning or purpose other than \"all bad guys are rapists\", then don't do it.\\n\\n\r\nWanna know why SAO does these things and gets away with it? Because you allow it to. Yes, you do.\\n\\n\r\nThis entire arc runs on the characters being dumb as a brick and plot convenience. And there are two grating examples: First, we learn that Death Gun is an SAO survivor, just like Kirito, only he was a Player-Killer. However, despite knowing where he came from, Kirito doesn't know who because when Death Gun was about to tell him his name, Kirito basically ignored him because he never thought he would see him again. Nothing works even on a basic level, because it feels like not a single piece of thought or logic was put into it.\\n\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, I tried to give this arc a fair chance, despite the fans saying it's the best one (and I never listen to the fans anyway, because I found this arc utter trash), but every single time it convinces me why I should never give Sword Art Online any chances at all. Because when you let your guard down for even one second, it drops to the bottom of the barrel. Honestly, this arc is only better than the last arc because it had none of that incest crap. Other than that, it's the same ol' trash I've come to expect from one of the biggest piles of garbage to plague anime in recent years.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc, titled Calibur, takes up Episodes 15 through 17. It follows Kirito and his harem and Klein going on a sidequest in ALO to find the Holy Sword Excalibur.\\n\\n\r\nWhat was even the point of this arc? No, seriously, what? Nothing. There was no point to it. It was basically the equivalent to filler. It's not like anything in the Calibur arc matters in the long run. Heck, nothing after Episode 14 matters honestly. It's like the writers just ran out of ideas and instead just show Kirito being awesome so the viewer can throw your money at the screen.\"It takes an idiot to do cool things. That's why it's cool.\" Honestly, that's Kirito in a nutshell: An idiot who does cool things, and you love it because Kirito is supposed to be you. That's you doing the cool things, and that's you being an idiot. Like I said before, blank slates like Kirito are not good characters. They're meant to be a medium of wish fulfillment and power fantasties, so that you can project yourself onto him, and his personality is what you make for him.\\n\\n\r\nThe only things really worth complaining about in this arc is Sinon, because like Asuna, her extstence is a complete sin to the entire series as a whole, and is only there because catgirl and contribute next to nothing. Also, Kirito's personality shifts between arcs, in which he goes from a shell-shocked warrior to a complete asshole. Even if you can say there's nothing at stake here, him being a jerk to his friends for no reason is really stupid. But it's okay because he's the main character, so no one will bat an eye about him yanking Sinon's tail or kicking Klein in the face.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I'd much rather take boring filler over the two arcs before that... and the next one.\\n\\n\r\nThe third and final arc of Season 2, titled Mother's Rosario, takes up Episodes 18 through 24, and while most fans say it's probably one of the best arcs, I disagree. I think it's up there with Fairy Dance as the worst of SAO as a whole, mainly because it promises a probability of SAO actually being somewhat decent only to do a complete 180 and show how low it will go to manipulate the viewer while at the same time laughing at the face for anyone who fell for its trickery. Mother's Rosario is SAO's biggest slap to the audience's faces. Remember when I said I should never give Sword Art Online any chances at all, because when you let your guard down for even one second, it drops to the bottom of the barrel? Well, this arc is the reason why I'm going to hold to that statement for the remainder of the series.\\n\\n\r\nIn this arc, Asuna takes center stage. Kirito has a small presence but enough to offer up some plot convenience in the arc, which is a good thing because Heaven forbid we keep making him the one and only star of the show, stealing everybody else's spotlight. She is recruited by Yuuki Konno/Zekken into her guild, the Sleeping Knights. Their goal is to defeat a Floor Boss with only seven players before they have to disband.\\n\\n\r\nLet me just say this: A character whose only goal in life is being Kirito-kun's waifu (which she said in the beginning of the season) is not even a character, let alone a strong one. And guess what? Asuna's character doesn't change beyond being Kirito-kun's waifu. Maybe she might have changed, but in the end, she reverts back to the way she started. Her story is basically dealing with her mother who wants to set Asuna's future. Which is understandable, because children at Asuna's age at this point (18, I believe) are nearing adulthood and have to start planning for their future. On one side, she's right about setting Asuna on the right path, because spending time online with friends won't get you anywhere in life. But on the other side, she's wrong for forcing it all onto Asuna without her say in the matter, which included, if you recall, marrying her off to a middle-aged businessman who kept her comatose and sexually assaulted her.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem here is that Asuna doesn't confront these problems head-on. She runs away from them. Whenever her mother calls her out on her spending time online with friends and Kirito, Asuna's first instinct is to walk away and attempt to escape from her harsh reality by running into Kirito's arms. Because she feels at home online with Kirito rather than with her own family in real life. I don't mind escapism so long as it's doesn't try to avoid and/or ignore the characters' issues in reality, which is what SAO does. Secondly, her running away the issue proves how childish and weak Asuna is. The show uses video games skills in place of character strengths, but in reality, these so-called strengths are artificial at most. Eventually, Asuna does decide to own up to her mother (albeit not on her own accord) and manages to reach a middle ground with her mother, but it mainly results in Asuna's mother being portrayed in the 100% wrong, and Asuna herself learns nothing. She still is Kirito-kun's waifu, a character whose ambitions and accomplishments are not her own.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Yuuki Konno: She may very well be considered the closest thing SAO will get to an actually likable female character. I know I say that there is nothing likable about any single female character, but compared to Asuna, Suguha, Sinon, and every other one, being a likable female character in SAO is an extremely low standard, and Yuuki took very little effort to surpass it. She is essentially the opposite of every female in SAO: She doesn't fall in love with Kirito, she doesn't become dependant on him at all, she doesn't end up in his harem, and she actually defeats Kirito in a PvP battle, which is a big achievement since Kirito only loses a fight due to some technicality. One might think that Yuuki's too good of a character for a pile of garbage like SAO.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, I thought the Mother's Rosario arc was surprisingly not half bad. I mean the past few arcs were utterly terrible, and because of the irreparable damage it has done to itself, I couldn't be optimistic that this arc will change my overall opinion of it. Again, the same issues that have been seen in most arcs are still present: The biggest one is Kirito himself. The guy is so Gary Stu that all the flashy sword swings and deflecting magic and what have you, everything he does is all show just to make him look awesome, but it makes me lose interest quickly. It's other biggest problem is its ability to handle emotional drama. Sure, Zekken and the Sleeping Kights are a fresh change of pace from Gary Stu and his harem of waifus, but there's some sense of turmoil from not only the fact that the team has to disband, but from something personal from Zekken herself. The problem is I cannot get invested in these characters alot because they never make their issues known to anyone, and the show is trying (and failing) to make me do so. I actually began to believe that Mother's Rosario is the arc that Sword Art Online should've been, which made me feel that all the previous arcs' past stupidity weren't worth reaching this point...\\n\\n\r\nOr so I thought before a certain point near the end.\\n\\n\r\nAs it turns out, Yuuki is terminally ill, and not just with any fictional illness. She has Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. AIDS. Not HIV, but full-blown AIDS. In 2011, her mom gave birth to Yuuki and her twin sister via C-section, which caused her to lose a severe amount of blood. The doctors then gave her HIV-infected blood that no one in the hospital knew it was infected until after the transfusion. Eventually, the virus spread across her family and they all died from it, and she's the next to go.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, FUCK YOU! Fuck you, Sword Art Online. There isn't a violin small enough for how sappy and goddamn stupid this is. This is the reason why I will always hate this garbage with every fiber of my being for as long as I live. Because it somehow manages to show itself it can be decent every so often only to jump back to the bottom of the barrel and make me look like a fool for getting my hopes up for nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that Yuuki has AIDS isn't the problem here. It's how she (and her family) got the AIDS, how it's handled here, and how it's only used as a substitute for character development. It's done in the most unrealistic way possible and makes you wonder if either the writers made the hospital staff incompetent on purpose so that this can happen, or they didn't even bother to do the research. I'm no medical expert, but I know enough that hospitals do check blood for any signs of infections before giving it to people. The technology to detect infections in blood exist, even in 2011. Heck, if the blood is infected, it wouldn't even be in the hospital. I'm not gonna ask myself why the Konno family didn't sue the pants off this hospital for medical malpractice because I'd be doing the writer's job. And let's be honest, anyone with a shred of common sense can do a better job at writing SAO than whatever you call this piss-poor excuse of writing. Heck, Captain Planet handled AIDS better, even though that was ridiculously overblown on a comical scale. AIDS is a disease that is usually contracted and spread through bodily fluids. It would be understandable for her dad to get it from her mom, but what about her older twin sister, born mere moments BEFORE Yuuki? How did she get the virus? There's no way. Not one single aspect about this story works, not even on a logical standpoint. There's no excuse for this. No amount of medical research can handwave or excuse, let alone justify what is irresponsible handling of a real-life terminal illness for the sake of artificial feels. This whole \"we didn't know the blood was infected until later\" story is a middle finger to medical science and to the audience's intelligence, and I'm just gonna give it one right back.\\n\\n\r\nThe Mother's Rosario arc is not some \"heartbreaking, beautiful, powerfully human tale\". It's nothing but a cheap sob story done in the most underhanded, manipulative, unrealistic, and overblown way imaginable. I like Yuuki, I really do; but I'm not going to say her character was developed that much, because she wasn't. Yeah, she's isn't as one-dimensional as all the other characters, but I felt more saddened that she had to be subject to how full of shit this show is, reduced into a vessel for ill-gotten sympathy. You have to let the audience feel the emotion for themselves. Forcing them to by giving a character Super AIDS is basically making your audience look like dumbasses. The one time I thought SAO might have a decent character and she's ruined by the worst possible idiotic melodrama because the writer still has his head too far up his own asshole. Why did I expect anything less? Considering that Kawahara once said that he's incapable of writing female characters that don't fall for Kirito (yeah, he did say that), I can't help but wonder if he decided to screw over Yuuki this way as punishment for not being like every other female character in SAO. Why even do this? Was it because Yuuki didn't become a part of Kirito's harem so Kawahara decided to off her with Super AIDS? I bet it was! Ultimately, the Mother's Rosario arc reflects SAO as a whole: A piece of garbage that takes a big steamy dump on whatever it pleases. Out of all the stupid moments SAO has done between its two seasons, this is the ultimate final nail in a coffin full of final nails. I'm not made of stone, but when shows try to manipulate the viewer into feeling sad, it's basically asking me to hate it.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a recurring problem with SAO as a whole, arguably its biggest one and the one that has brought the entire season down. The writers has an insistence on handlng heavy subjects such as sexual assault, post-traumatic stress, terminal illnesses, and what have you, and every time they try, it only shows how immature the writing is as they end up being used as a plot device and done in a completely unrealistic way. If anything, the way such issues are portrayed here could be construed as disrespectful to those who has experienced it themselves. When it comes to things like this, either do it in a respectful manner or don't do it at all; there is no middle ground about it. These kinds of things have absolutely no business being here if it's not going to be handled in the right manner.\\n\\n\r\nContrary to what some may say, Season 2 of Sword Art Online is in no way any better than the first season.  Actually, it's WORSE than the previous season. At least the first season started out good before descending into garbage. This season was hot garbage on a plate from start to finish. At this point, even the most minuscule shred of sympathy I had for SAO and its toxic fanbase is as good as dead. It's nothing but a dumpster fire that can ONLY get worse. Something that has learned from none of its mistakes, which should've made evident when it trivialized sexual asault for the second time in a row. needs to be thrown into the garbage, where it belongs.\\n\\n\r\nOnce a pile of garbage, always a pile of garbage.",

            "content": "Ok. So there's a lot of reviews for this out there so mine's going to be a little different. Bear with me guys. Bear. With. Me.\r\nOne. Two. Three Four Five\r\nEverybody grab a gun and c'mon lets ride...\r\nYep. That Mambo N.5 appropriation pretty much sums up the first arc of SAO II. The only problem is the people driving seem to even more geographically challenged than me, and as the anime's seemingly directionless take becomes apparent you'll find yourself yelling 'For fuck sake use a GPS'. Yep. This anime has trouble navigating itself.\r\nBut smash on the beaks and hop on out. Lets step back, shall we,and look at the bigger picture. Coming as a sequel to the original SAO I'd pull the words 'hype' and 'expectations' from my metaphorical hat. Whilst both were there the hype seemed to remain for far longer than my expectations - which were quickly smashed into the ground. Ouch!\\n\\n\r\nThe sequel seemed to serve to accentuate the flaws of the original and downplay any strengths it had. Plot inconsistencies rose to new heights as what was seemingly at stake trudged lower than ever. Fanservice made an appearance at awkward moments and some of the motives behind peoples actions made as much sense as a giraffe eating a dinosaur. What? You say. What indeed.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, it's not all bad! Open those eyes and ears! The animation and sound were done well, and whilst I wasn't fond of characterisation and development early it did get a little better towards the end. SAO II is also a little special in that it has a unique charm to it, where you know it's bad but somewhat enjoy it anyway. That being said I did find myself getting bored at moments and looking at the ceiling (oh how plain white ceilings entertain me).\\n\\n\r\nWe don't want to be here forever, so lets sum up! This anime is a polariser. It has a lot of flaws and a couple of strengths. You might like it, you might not. The problems that exist in this anime are very in your face (similar to a non-scary ghost popping out in a haunted house). You can't miss it. The question is, how much does it bother you? \\n\\n\r\nIt broke my 10 pairs of rose-tinted glasses in the first few episodes. How many pairs do you have?",

            "content": "\u2018Right here, I can\u2019t tell you what I\u2019m thinking and what I feel. I want you to see my world!\u2019\r\nSAO was a one trick pony. Its death game premise burdened the already heavy task of climbing Castle Aincrad\u2019s 100 floors. But the illusion of the unconquerable castle would often break, as the anime proper would skip floors at the story\u2019s convenience. Halfway through, the show lost the sense of scale it needed to cover for what the characters lacked. In many ways, we saw their world, but not their feelings. SAO was a lukewarm experience.\r\nWhich makes me proud to say SAO II is actually quitegood.\\n\\n\r\nA year after the SAO incident, Kirito is assigned to investigate a series of real life deaths linked to the videogame Gun Gale Online, or GGO. By playing GGO, Kirito hopes to directly contact the prime suspect, Death Gun, and discover the truth behind these deaths. Let it be said now that, much like SAO, SAO II is more of an alternate world fantasy than a reflection of videogames. There are inconsistencies in the game mechanics abound that would make videogame purists cringe. Then again, if you\u2019ve seen the first season, there\u2019s nothing here you haven\u2019t seen before.\\n\\n\r\nExcept for the things we haven\u2019t seen before. It\u2019s a lot, and it\u2019s mostly for the better. The pacing is now steady and believable, instead of skipping multiple events at a time or spending a lot of time on one event. In turn, Death Gun\u2019s dominating presence in the GGO storyline is unmitigated, while the Mother\u2019s Rosario story arc is steeped in nostalgia. Unfortunately, the three episode mini saga of Excalibur is little more than SAO II\u2019s last love letter to its harem fans without care for telling a good story. But the crack left by the Sword in the Stone is barely a dent to its characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s a good thing too, because what SAO II lacks in scale more than makes up for in its characters. Kirito especially has improved a lot. Gone are the days where his only real challenges were ones where strength alone wasn\u2019t enough. Now he\u2019s both \u2018mentally\u2019 examined and physically tested, especially during GGO. He is a much more rounded character for it, but unfortunately this character arc doesn\u2019t go the extra mile. The source of his inner anguish also feels like a rewrite of SAO.\\n\\n\r\nCo starring with Kirito in GGO is Sinon. Her quiet casualness in real life masks a silent strength in the game, but there\u2019s no moment where her real self and game self clash to make her feel like a different character. It\u2019s two identities created by a single incident in her past, with the events of GGO bleeding them together and forcing her to confront her fears. It is a slow burning, punishing journey that thankfully does not fully solve her problems even at the end. The story recognizes how weakness needs to be overcome one small step at a time, and the time with Sinon is time well spent.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Sinon\u2019s development isn\u2019t the only thing SAO II likes to show off. To be sure, the fight scenes and music are still as slick as they ever were (I freaking love Tomatsu Haruka\u2019s \u2018Courage\u2019), while the GGO setting is lively and distinct despite the brown and grey everywhere. From the shrub forest encroaching the river to the mesh of an abandoned metropolis and old west town, SAO II is the envy of first person shooter games everywhere. It\u2019s just too bad the visuals also show off Sinon\u2019s backside a bit too much. Which is odd, because the last story arc, Mother\u2019s Rosario, doesn\u2019t have anything like this.\\n\\n\r\nWell, whatever.\\n\\n\r\nIf the Alfheim story is what took away Asuna\u2019s integrity from the Aincrad arc, Mother\u2019s Rosario puts this woman back in form with a vengeance. She\u2019s faced with the reality of what two years lost means in real life, while forging the friendship of a lifetime with someone in the game world. Asuna doesn\u2019t develop in this story in the traditional sense, but she doesn\u2019t need to. She\u2019s smart enough to know why some people are acting the way they do with her, while her congeniality was always a part of her. What Asuna needed were characters to bounce off of, and the Mother\u2019s Rosario provides just that.\\n\\n\r\nIn particular are the two characters this story introduces. One is estranged to Asuna to play the role of antagonist but never a villain. She is frighteningly believable in what she says, and could definitely hit close to home for a lot of viewers. The other character is one half of the most believable relationship in the entire series. The development between them is silly, sweet, smooth, and not once does the feeling between Asuna and this new character ever feel romantic. Their relationship flawlessly glides across the tightrope called \u2018intimately platonic\u2019 that\u2019s so easy to fall off from.\\n\\n\r\nTalk about refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of all the surface improvements from SAO, SAO II is thematically unified without being heavy handed. From Sinon\u2019s reason for playing GGO, to Death Gun\u2019s motive for terrorizing others, to another\u2019s gung-ho liveliness in the game, SAO II is more about the power of online identity than an alternate world fantasy adventure. For better or worse, people change who they are or show their true colors online. And SAO II builds this naturally to the point where the show never loses its narrative breath.\\n\\n\r\nThe mark of a good story is it won\u2019t build itself around a theme, but that the theme builds itself around the story. For SAO II to understand this despite having blundered so much in its first season on top of its own improvements, honestly makes me wonder: is this seriously the same series that left me so conflicted? THIS is SAO?\\n\\n\r\nAnd then I looked again.\\n\\n\r\nThis is SAO II.",

            "content": "Like most of the community, I was watching Sword Art Online whilst it was airing about four or five years ago, and I remember how everyone collectively became more and more disappointed with the show as it was airing. Not only was the show's pacing completely out of control with constant time skips amongst many other glaring issues during the first half, the show practically imploded in on itself during the horrendous second arc, which only left nothing but a bad taste in my mouth. At the time, I hated the show, and still do to a certain extent now, but my main thought wasthat, at the very least, Sword Art Online couldn't get any worse... right? Unfortunately, I was proven wrong since the second season of Sword Art Online proved to be even worse, becoming one of the worst anime I have ever had the displeasure of consuming in my entire life. While there are perhaps one or two elements of the show that is worthy of praise, the negatives far outweigh the positives and this review will be tackling all three arcs in order while practically spoiling every event in the show, so take that as a warning if you're planning to watch this anime at some point. With all of that out of the way, let's jump into the Phantom Bullet arc!\\n\\n\r\nPHANTOM BULLET ARC (1/10):\\n\\n\r\nThis arc is one of the worst story arcs I have ever seen. What could have been an interesting look into the mental state and psyche of Kirito, just becomes an aimless mess with no sense of direction, followed by glaring pacing issues and awful characters as well as a terrible villain. This arc does so much wrong that's insanely annoying to watch and I constantly wanted to consume cyanide during my viewing to taste the sweet, sweet relief of death. The second season of SAO takes place a year after the events of the first season and opens up with Kirito and Asuna on a date, happily reminiscing about their time in Sword Art Online. Y'know... that place where thousands of people met their horrible demise? Perhaps they view the entire experience as some sort of romantic honeymoon or something. Anyway, whilst on this date, Kirito is asked by some government dude if he could speak to him about some strange incidences involving the massively popular game known as \"Gun Gale Online\". Government-kun tells Kirito-sama that in this game, a player has been able to successively kill other plays in the game, resulting in their real-life deaths. The viewer learns of this player, called \"Death Gun\" from the opening scene of the show. Not only is the character design a lesser version of Darth Vader, but the name \"Death Gun\" just seems silly and stupid. A gun's primary use is that of a weapon; to kill people and bring about death. So, I guess the gun is double the death then...? I guess it does make sense in the context of the show since this \"double death gun\" does result in the avatar and the real-life death of the person controlling said avatar, but the name does seem a little silly for someone trying to be so intimidating and feels more like a cheap knock off, of the Death Note than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Government-kun asks Kirito-sama if he will work with him by going inside Gun Gale Online to try and put a stop to Death Gun, and, after some reluctance at first, Kirito agrees and the rest of the arc sees Kirito attempting to find out Death Gun's true identity. Now, this sounds fine on paper, but the execution for this arc is terrible. First of all, let's discuss Kirito's character and the HUGE waste in potential this anime throws out the window in regards to his PTSD. At some point in the show, while Kirito is about to enter a tournament in the game (I'll get to the specifics of this in a bit) we learn that Death Gun was a part of a group called \"Laughing Coffin\" in Sword Art Online; a group that Kirito and Asuna fought and was forced to kill some of their members. This triggers Kirito's PTSD and this is easily one of the most interesting things that have ever happened to his character since he actually exhibits symptoms of actually being a real, genuine person for once; it helps his character feel more grounded and relatable than simply being a generic self-insert. Kirito's psychological stress and hang-ups in regards to actually killing someone and having this link into the main villain was a smart idea and could have allowed for so much development and understanding of his character and just really how much damage SAO had done to his mental well being. This COULD have been the case if the show expanded on it at all. Kirito's physiological hang-ups barely last for even one episode, which means that his character hardly develops as a person and, instead, is completely absolved of his stress and worries after only a five-minute talk with some nurse at a hospital! They throw out the only interesting thing that has ever happened to this character in only one episode! After this, Kirito just devolves back into the boring, self-insert that he is and his character ceases to ever be interesting ever again. The fact that the show throws out its only redeeming quality is just a flick in the nuts to the audience and, again, is such wasted potential. The show should have started with Kirito waking up in bed or something, after having a dream about the time in which he killed someone in SAO, which would imply that Kirito has been suffering from his PTSD for a while now, as the rest of the show sees him come to terms with what he has done in the past and slowly learn to accept it and move on with his life. It could have made for a fantastic character study, but is just thrown to the side like a child with a toy.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of wasted potential, this also brings me to the other main character of this arc, Shion. Shion does have a bit more in the way of investment and drive in this narrative but is just as poorly handled like every other element in the show. As a child, Shion was caught up in a post office robbery, in which she manages to get the gun of the robber and shoot him, effectively killing him and saving the lives of everyone in the post office. This, however, has given her a severe phobia of guns, to the point where she throws up at the very sight of them. In order to overcome her phobia, she plays Gun Gale Online, a game all about battling it out with guns in an attempt to overcome her fear of them and she believes that, by winning the Bullet of Bullets tournament (the same one as Kirito enters) , she will be finally strong enough to overcome her fear and move on with her life. Her motivation in this narrative is not so bad but it lacks intrigue. Shion, herself, is a boring character since her characterisation is minimal and I always found it hard to connect to her or care for her struggles or goal. She consistently repeats some of the corniest and irritating lines in the entire show, most prominently during a fight in the second episode where she proclaims that another player is \"strong enough to smile on the battlefield\". The entire show is filled with these corny lines, and I understand that, to this character, the game is a huge deal in overcoming her ordeal but it feels like the show is trying to force drama and narrative stakes with cheesy, hyperbolic lines; it feels superficial and clunky. Shion's character is effectively ruined once she meets big strong Kirito who saves her at every hurdle and sorts out every problem for her. Like every other girl in this series, Shion does begin to feel feelings towards Kirito and she simply becomes just another boring, uninteresting love interest. Her character feels lazily thrown together, with all of the typical Tsundere traits you'd expect. She slaps Kirito after seeing her in minimal clothing (despite it being a video game), she has an apprehensive personality and her character is as inconsistent as a corrupt politician's views. The main problem I have with her character is how quickly the show is willing to let her become the damsel in distress who needs Kirito to save her when it should be the other way around. Shion should have been a side character Kirito meets inside the game, who helps Kirito work out his own mental hang-ups, but instead, she is used for pandering to the Otakus and all the teenagers who see Mr Kirito Mclovin as a self-insert for themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThe Villain, Death Gun, is just as bad as these two characters, if not worse in many regards. Myself and many others were able to figure out the identity of who Death Gun really was only after the first episode. Once I saw the opening, I pretty much figured it out since A-1 Pictures doesn't understand subtleties in the slightest. Whilst watching the opening, we see a shot of Shion's friend, Shinkawa, reach out his hand to her while she is on a swing. As he does so, the screen explodes into flames with Death Gun riding on a horse. This visual queue was more than enough for me to understand and suspect that he was Death Gun, which later proved to be correct, but even without this blunder, it is painfully easy to get since Shinkawa seems too nice to be true to Shion and the hints they drop are not exactly subtle. Not only that, but the way the author wrote the way around how Death Gun kills people is needlessly convoluted and stupid. It turns out that Death Gun was working as part of a three-man team, and one person out of this team would go the player's house in the real world, with a lethal injection, ready to inject the person with this stuff, once Death Gun's bullet connects with said person in the game. This would mean that the person at the house would have to be watching a live stream of the tournament, waiting until the bullet connects in order to inject the person. There is so much goddamn wrong with this. For starters, there was no need for such an overly complicated scenario since we already know that this is a fantasy world in which anything is possible. Why couldn't Death Gun kill someone in the game without resorting to this overly complicated and frankly, messy, idea? Not only that, but what happens when the person ready to inject the medicine believes that the bullet connected but it didn't really? What happens if the player is hit but he doesn't see it? This is so stupid it hurts...\\n\\n\r\nAnother huge problem is the lack of tension in this arc. Kirito, as usual, is a damn God who can do anything the plot demands from him, just because he is Kirito. One of the things I was most looking forward to in this arc was the fact that Kirito was playing a gun game, a weapon he was not accustomed to and he would have had to learn how to properly yield one and adapt to this world. Much like how the audience wouldn't know anything about this game, Kirito wouldn't either and we could grow attached to this character, seeing him learn the rules and get better the more he played. It would have created, y'know... NARRATIVE TENSION AND STAKES! But, no, Kirito finds a light saber, and thus is now unstoppable since we already know he can use a sword with no trouble whatsoever. Not only that, but despite this game being for hardcore players, Kirito pretty much destroys every single one of them instantly, learns how to use the very hard to control buggies straight away and pretty much deduces the entire plot for the audience through very long and drawn out monologues and exposition scenes. And holy hell is the exposition for this arc terrible! There are so many cafe exposition scenes in this show that it is insane and all of them just essentially tell the audience directly about the plot or how the characters are feeling. Setting exposition scenes in cafes is one of the laziest and boring ways to push a story forward and there are so many scenes like this that I almost fell asleep on many occasions. It's visually boring and only serves to pad out time, and the pacing for this arc is also pretty bad. Stretching out the source material into such a length was a bad idea since it leads to many scenes feeling as if they're dragging on for far too long. Take for example the episodes where Kirito and Shion are taking refuge inside a cave during the Bullet of Bullets tournament. We spend nearly two whole episodes in this god damn cave as we see both characters explain their predicaments and back stories to one another in slow and dull ways. We don't learn anything about the characters nor do we see them grow either, only in that Shion wants Kirito's dick a little more as a result. It's incredibly boring to watch since they just explain their backstories once again to the audience, which, at this point, only serves to pad out the arc and episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe game of Gun Gale Online itself feels so badly done and I imagine that, if this game were real, nobody would be playing this damn game! I have a lot more respect for a show that goes the extra mile to make their world believable but here, the game mechanics that the author thought of to put in the game feel so stupid. For starters, we are told that Gun Gale Online is the only game that has professional, hardcore players which is just a ridiculous notion since I can think of plenty of games off the top of my head that already have pro players, but the customisation option presented in the game is stupid too. We learn that in this game the player has no control over their avatar and it is randomly selected for you! Why on Earth is this a thing? In games, developers are constantly trying to expand on customisation, and the fact that Gun Gale Online locks you into only one playable class only adds to the fact that this game is broken! Moreover, if the avatars are randomly selected for you, then why the hell does Shion look like herself just with blue hair as well as Kirito, only now with longer hair and his character model is that of a female, while other avatars look nothing like their real-life owners? You may call these pedantic things to complain about, and perhaps they are, but when the show is this boring and dull, my mind wonders over to such things since I am not immersed in anything that is happening. \\n\\n\r\nEven the animation wasn't that stellar with frequent use of recap footage and many of the scenes set inside cafes with two characters simply taking. Even the final fight between Kirito and Death Gun is incredibly dull and anti-climatic to boot. This arc is just SO bad on every level from the insanely bad writing, to the stupid as hell plot, to the wasted potential and characters. Everything about the Phantom Bullet arc is awful and I still have even more things to complain and talk about, but I'm getting way ahead of myself. I still have two more arcs to go!\\n\\n\r\nCALIBUR ARC (4/10):\\n\\n\r\nI actually don't have too much to say with this arc since it is rather simple. After Gun Gale Online had finished airing its episodes, many people were tired out from the experience, and for many fans of the series, this was the arc that brought them back to enjoying SAO once again. This arc is a lot more simple in its complexity and is essentially about Kirito and his harem, dicking around in Alfheim Online. Essentially, Kirito and friends hear news of the legendary item, Calibur, has been found and set off on a mission to get this item, along with newcomer to the harem, Shion, who is now put on pause forever and is now part of Kirito's harem bitches. It's an arc that fans of the series will enjoy since it is mostly just comedic hi-jinks and while I did find some of the jokes funny, mostly regarding Klien, I found the arc to be pretty boring since I don't have a modicum of interest for any of these characters at all. It's not a bad arc, but an incredibly boring one for those who, like me, do not like these characters.\\n\\n\r\nMOTHER'S ROSARIO ARC (6/10):\\n\\n\r\nNow, I believe it is time to give some credit where I believe credit is due. This arc is actually not terrible and manages to do quite a lot that actually managed to impress me while handing a character death in a mature and even quite sad way too. This arc focuses more so on Asuna as the main character which I was happy for considering that Asuna is the only character that has anything going for her and luckily her character is not completely ruined and gets some small development. This arc focuses mainly on a girl called Yuki, who is a fantastic player in the game of Alfheim Online, who actually manages to beat Kirito in a fight! Can you believe it?! Anyway, we learn that this character actually has aids and is close to her death, but what is great is that this death and character is actually handled with a lot of care and heart. Yuki's character is simply not there just so that she can be used as a cheap plot device to evoke tears and drama into the story, but actually develops nicely over the course of this story arc into a respectable character, and, while I didn't cry at her death, the show was successful enough to evoke sadness in such a cynical cunt such as myself. \\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to feel emphatic towards Yuki's character since she is very lovable and easy to care about. She feels like a real kid going through such a horrible ordeal and her final moments were surprisingly well done. The arc isn't great, however, since the pacing, again, is pretty bad and the newly introduced characters, other than Yuki, don't get much attention and are pushed to the sides, but overall, this arc was a massive improvement. Not only that, but the animation quality and fight choreography are a bit better than that of Gun Gale Online and the arc has a killer opening too. There is much to like about this arc but it ultimately doesn't absolve all of the crap that Gun Gale Online put me through either. \\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, SAO II is a mess. It has frequent tonal shifts, the narrative is terrible with glaring plot holes and other glaring writing issues and even the few things that are worthy of praise, are not enough to raise the bar or change my stance on this show. I know that recently, it has become very trendy and hip to hate on SAO, and while I don't think this show is the worst anime ever made, it certainly is far from good, and every aspect of the show is so lazily produced and boring.",

            "content": "When I heard SAO was getting a second season, I was excited. Yes, SAO is one of my favorite animes, but I try not to let that cloud my judgement for how I would score it. \r\nStory: 6\r\nAs you can read in the series description, a player of a shooter VRMMO is killing people in the game. This is the first arc (Phantom Bullet). Kirito gets sent into the game because he's apparently the closest thing to a professional gamer at the disposal of the company trying to solve the mystery of how the player is killing people. Sinon is a sniper in that samegame and she's trying to overcome some trauma from her past by 'becoming strong' in the game. It felt a bit drawn out at times, but it still kept me interested as I waited to see how the arc would end.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc (Caliber) is more of a filler arc than anything. Kirito and his harem go on a quest to get excalibur in ALO that takes three episodes. It was a fun little adventure, but it didn't expand the characters in any way, and the overall quest itself was a bit of an odd draw on Norse mythos.\\n\\n\r\nThe third arc (Mother's Rosario) involves Asuna taking the role of MC and going on an adventure with a new group of characters, namely Yuuki, to try and clear a New Aincrad floor before anyone else. It was a lot of fun to watch, with plenty of sword art sword play and the new group, the Sleeping Knights guild, had a secret that made me care a bit about them (I think I cared about the Sleeping Knights more than I cared about the majority of Kirito's harem).\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 9\\n\r\nThe main things I love about SAO return in its second season. The music sounds fantastic and the art is amazing. Not much more needs to be said there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nThe usual shortcoming of SAO is its characters, and its second season isn't really an exception. The third arc has Asuna trying to face her own weakness in the real world compared to her strength in VRMMOs, but it's kind of a side-note to the story. Most of the attempts at character development are seen in the first arc. Kirito finally starts to deal with the trauma that comes with the fact that he killed people in Sword Art Online, but that's about it for his character. Sinon, the other MC for the first arc, is given more depth as she tries to come to terms with her own past. However, her interesting character is practically dismissed in order to turn her into the missing tsundere component of Kirito's harem, which was rather disappointing to see. She was a strong character who was reduced to a mess when her trauma followed her into the game, leading her to completely rely on Kirito in the most tsundere ways she could.\\n\\n\r\nI wasn't really a fan of how much of a prodigy Kirito became out of nowhere in this season. Hacking SAO itself back in season one to save Yui wasn't enough to prove his technology prowess; he now makes little cameras that make it so game characters can see the real world without any difficulty whatsoever. The only explanation given to his mechanical genius is that he has been on the internet.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nEven though I was REALLY disappointed to see Sinon merge into Kirito's harem without a second thought, it was still a fun season to watch. The art and sound still kept the scenes alive for me and I managed to forgive the shortcomings in the characters and story just because I was still having fun. It may have been ridiculous, but it was fun watching Kirito basically turn into a jedi to deflect bullets in a shooter game.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nIt's still SAO. Kirito has his harem and still cares for Asuna. Sinon unfortunately becomes a part of the harem, but had a good char before that. Art and Sound still carry the show past its shortcomings for me.\\n\\n",

            "content": "*Review contains minor spoilers of Sword Art:Online and Log Horizon too*\r\n I have seen thousands of people who compare Log Horizon with Sword Art:Online and how much it is better from SAO and most of them people are from here only. Don't get me wrong as a gamer person myself, I like both series. My review covers up 2 anime of same genre!\r\nStory- Overall, the Plot is totally messed up all the 5 arcs (SAO,ELF,GGO,Excalibur,Mother's Rosario), even though the very first SAO arc of the first season is still slightly better than the rest.To sum up this is the order SAO>Mother's Rosario>GGO>Excalibur>>>ELF. But, I don'tsee how Log Horizon is any better? \\n\\n\r\n-The story development is just too slow to the point I find myself sleeping. At least SAO series have pump up action/fighting scenes and romance which is a + point for me. Yes, I agree Log Horizon has romance too, but it is still one sided. The main drawback of both these series is actually the story's atmosphere. In SAO first arc people can die, but players still carry out their daily events like rape, killing, fun, sleeping with no care,sex, marriage. On the other hand In Log horizon if players actually die, they can still respawn at the respawn point. But, Still way too serious on focusing Politics, Govt, rules and regulations 85% of the anime revolves around this. These kind of genres was needed in SAO and SAO in Log Horizon.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- Here I can agree with Log Horizon's fans. SAO has poor characters and character development. The whole show revolves around our female attracter kirito as an OP MC even if new characters are introduced like Sinon in GGO. Kirito is still the main attraction (Yes, clearly the main attraction specially in GGO* ) \\n\\n\r\n-Where as in Log Horizon has better and lovable characters and personalities but, then again I think it just has way too many characters. Just see the opening of the Log Horizon how many characters it has. I had a hard time remembering all of them. Every episode at least introduce 2 new characters though not all are given enough development, and some are soon forgotten but, at least this series has 3 main characters that is Shiroe, Akatsuki, Naotsugu unlike SAO where every season old characters are treated like background wallpapers except kirito. I am gonna give a brief review on both the MCs of these shows.\\n\\n\r\nKirito- Yes he is OP to the point he can overwrite codes of the games, just with willpower, female attracter ( Agree with this because for real if you save a female twice, she will have some sort of feels for you), but all they back off when they realize kirito is in relationship with asuna. So, NO ITS NOT HAREM! You will also see huge improvement from Season 1 to Season 2. Kirito's OP moments are toned down a lot, he defeated death gun with the help of sinon and Kirito is not even the main character in the mother's rosario arc. Asuna gets major development and it was really emotional . You gotta give credit, where you see improvement! \\n\\n\r\nShiroe- He is OP too but not as OVER OP as kirito. When it comes to flawless strategies shiroe beats kirito, but if it comes to power and skills kirito> Shiroe. Shiroe is a mage class unlike Kirito's melee class, But you will hardly see Shiroe in a battle. Most of the time, It will be side characters who fights in the battle. All Shiroe does in the battle is act as a narrator give battle's explanation, even in those battles where shiroe's contribution is null to the battle plan. As for female attractor Shiroe is quite a charm himself. Akatuski likes him and there's one more girl who likes him. So, Currently there is a love triangle going-on and one more girl who wants Shiroe on her side.\\n\\n\r\nArt- SAO beats Log horizon here, because of beautiful colors used in animation and actually you can see improvements of the animation from season 1- season 2, where as Log Horizon remains the same. You will see no improvement! \\n\\n\r\nSound- Again SAO takes the thrown why? Log horizon opening song is sure is damn good, but from episode 1-25 it uses same opening song, and just to make the listeners get fed up of the song even more. Creators uses same opening song for the season 2 ANOTHER 25 EPISODES SAME OPENING AGAIN where as SAO Opening songs changes every arc. Now, if we compare the ending songs SAO takes the cake easily. ED2 of SAO II is so far the best ending song in the whole SAO series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- SAO has a replay value for some, where as Log Horizon none because there's hardly any impressive fight scenes all there is politics, how to make govt. etc. The season 2 of Log horizon is really disappointing compare to S1. Here, I guess fans can agree at least SAOII>Log Horizon II\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S- I know my review might make many users flipping middle finger to the monitor and be like (F*** this guy). But, hey this is just what I feel and it is my personal opinion!",

            "content": "[spoilers] I really don't believe that Sword Art Online 2 deserves the 3-4/10 scores it has been receiving as it is largely a big improvement over the mess that was the ALO arc of Sword Art Online 1. \r\nGGO - this new arc brings an interesting new VRMMO world and setting along with new main character, Sinon who has an interesting background and has some decent character development throughout the arc until she manages to overcome her fears in the real world. There are definitely some pacing issues as there is an episode where there is only talking in a cave which offers some gooddialogue but may feel slow. The fight scenes are of course well animated, especially Kiritos photon sword effects. \\n\\n\r\nCalibur Arc - It doesn't offer much relevance to the main story and was originally a side story in the SAO light novels but it does offer some interesting story for the side characters like Klein. \\n\\n\r\nMother's Rosario - This arc is supposed to be one of the best arcs in the light novels and I believe it was handled quite well. Although it is a bit short there is definitely time to care about Yuuki. The fight scenes between Asuna and Yuuki were animated very well. It also offers some interesting development for Asuna as she tries to become strong in the real world by standing up to her mom and allowing her to see things from her perspective. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Both Ignite and Courage are great opening themes and Shirushi (ED3) is amazing. The soundtrack is well done again but does use a lot of SAO 1 tracks. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good animation as usual. Fight scenes are handled well",

            "content": "*may contain spoilers ; yeah I've read the novel, but this is about the anime adaptation*\r\nOh God... I don't know how to begin. I did enjoy SAO 2, but once again I can't rate it with numbers. I have to write down my feeling, since that's the only way for a writer to make himself understood :)\r\nSo in 2012 this anime called Sword Art Online appeared. If you are interested in my opinion about it, please read my review, I won't spend any time to repeat what I've said there. But in 2014 we got the sequel. It was announced, that it will be abouta new game called Gun Gale Online, a game where guns are the common weapons. I was surprised, that everyone was so upset about this. Okay, it's strange that in an anime called Sword Art Online people will use guns, but apart from that I've had no problem with it. Well the sequel finished airing, I watched it and... well let's just begin with the story.\\n\\n\r\nOur story begins one year after Kirito escaped from SAO and saved Asuna from ALO. Kirito lives his happy, daily life, but one day he gets a call from a guy with a suit (sorry, that's all I remember about his character) who says there are some problems in the virtual world again. We are informed, that in a game called Gun Gale Online a strange figure appeared. He calls himself Death Gun and claims, that he can kill anyone with a shot within the game. Of course nobody believes him, but after two casualties, the guy with the suit informs Kirito. He asks him to get in there and investigate the case, and Kirito, as the superhero of the virtual world enters GGO. There, he meets Sinon, a female sniper and together with her he enters the competition called Bullet of Bullets (basically the same as a series of duels and the winner gets a prize), where he might be able to make contact with this Death Gun guy. Soon he realizes, that something is not right with the identity of this player, and Sinon's dark past comes back to haunt her too. Soon the question appears once again: What if virtual reality becomes your reality?\\n\\n\r\nWell guys first things first, GGO is a lot better, than SAO! I mean seriously. SAO had a better story and better potential, but GGO was adapted really well. You won't feel anymore, that it's rushed. It takes it time and stays interesting at the same time. It still won't answer your serious questions and the big wave of psychology still didn't come, but you know what? I don't care! Because I got a really interesting and epic story. The mystery of Death Gun is really interesting, and you will do the same, you do while watching a good crime story. You will try to make theories about Death Gun. Well in the end the reality will be a bit more simple than I awaited, but that's not a problem. It's really fun watching all the fights, the chemistry between Kirito and Sinon and the process, how do they deal with their past.\\n\\n\r\nOnto characters. Kirito is still awesome. He still acts like an invincible player though, which is not a really big problem, since this is not SAO anymore, but he could be a little more afraid of this Death Gun. But Sinon, OMG. She's a really good female lead, I can't believe her character was written by the same guy, who wrote Asuna. She is also really badass, but she also has her female charm. It's really fun watching, how Kirito always surpasses her, no matter how hard she is trying. And when her dark past comes forth, you can really feel for her. Long story short, the characters are a lot better in GGO.\\n\\n\r\nGGO was great. I hate rating in numbers, but I would gladly give GGO a 9/10... oh wait a minute. I gave it a 6. Why?\\n\\n\r\nWell they did it again. In the anime called SAO 2, but also known as Gun Gale Online, Gun Gale Online ends in episode 14. I don't get what's with this 14 episode rule. And as you would guess, YEAH, we are going back to ALfheim. But this time, two arc, 10 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we get 3 episodes of Calibur. Why? Is there anyone, who read the novel and said: ''Calibur is my favorite!'' ? Calibur was the longest 3 episodes of my life. Seriously, it doesn't make any sense. They are just doing a minor quest in ALfheim, and literally NOTHING is at stake. Yeah, they want you to believe, that the system can rewrite itself and hell can appear in that game, but anyone who has ever played an MMO knows, that it does not work like that. The only positive about Calibur is a cute moment between Kirito and Sinon near the end.\\n\\n\r\nThen Mother's Rosario, the remaining 7 episodes. Well MR is a side story of SAO. It's about Asuna, who meets a girl called Yuuki, who for some reason really wants to defeat a boss in ALfheim. (yeah I know it's not ALfheim) But later Asuna finds out, that Yuuki has some really serious problems in her real life. Mother's Rosario is once again about the concept, that virtual reality becomes reality for someone. But that won't change the fact that it's a side story. It's a big longer than it should be, and while it's interesting in the beginning, it gets really boring later on. And when you reach the sad conclusion, you won't even care anymore. Asuna still doesn't have any character and while Yuuki is an interesting person, her story is way too simple.\\n\r\nHere's what I think. After the end of GGO they should have either end the season or begin Alicization ark. Mother's Rosario should have been a movie, since it's just a side story. (Calibur? who cares about that?)\\n\\n\r\nOnce again I have to mention the art and the sound. The voice actors/actresses made an amazing job, the music is still fantastic. But this time the art and animation are on top! GGO just looks amazing, seriously even more beautiful, than SAO. The cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic backgrounds are orgasmic. And when Kirito starts to dodge the bullets... I thought I'll cu... cucumber? Long story short, it's awesome! The artist really did give their everything. I'm not even talking about Kajiura Yuki anymore, this is like her second nature.\\n\\n\r\nSo what is the verdict?\\n\r\nThe first 14 episodes are really good in my opinion. They are epic, interesting, well-adapted and probably they did everything right, what SAO did not. But the second half f***s up the whole thing again. Calibur is boring and uninterestig, and while Mother's Rosario is a decent story itself, the way it was apadted is really mediocore. I can't even believe, the last 10 episodes were made by the same studio.\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend it?\\n\r\nYeah I do, but I can't say, that I enjoyed every bit of it this time. It was a real pain in the *ss to finish the last 10 episodes. Anyway, GGO is really good, and if you are a fan of cyberpunk or FPS games, it will be twice as much fun to watch it.\\n\\n\r\n(Thank you for reading this, sorry for my English and for all the comas I will never learn to use them properly :) )",

            "content": "After leaving out my spiced scavenged toad meat and deus ex machina milk for Santa, I knew that it was inevitably time. Time to unwrap the present that I never wanted to unwrap, the wool socks that awaited under the Christmas tree. Sword Art Online II. So boys and girls, I'm wearing my Grinch costume, and I'm ready to delve into the mess that is SAO season 2. \r\nWhen I think of the controversial title, \"Sword Art Online\", the word that often times pops up into my head is \"potential\". It's like when you write a gift on your gift list for Santa that youknow could be really good because everyone said it would be, or really bad because somebody hated it. But with the Christmas spirit in me, I had hope. After all, Sword Art Online has always captured the interest of many with its bold attempt to tackle the Virtual Game genre, mixed with an artistic flair that was captivating and epic soundtrack. But I must have been naughty, because Santa checked his list and he checked it twice. And what I got in SAO II was nothing more than a big heaping lump of coal. My Christmas was ruined! Almost, at least. I was disappointed, and I was frustrated. The Phantom Bullet arc, the Excaliber arc and the Mother's Rosario arc all stained my mind. So I had to take time to digest some of it along with my eggnog. \\n\\n\r\nThe gift wrapping on Sword Art Online II was really pretty. I mean it was beautiful, perfectly in match with Christmas and with a gold ribbon surrounding its corners with a bow on top. On the outside, it looked pretty good so far! Just like the first season, Sword Art Online II went with a more dark theme in the Phantom Bullet arc where once again lives are in danger from a dangerous criminal and it's up to Kirito to save them again. Wait a minute, hold on. Let me look at that wrapping from season I again. I quickly pulled out my phone and looked at the wrapping for Season I, ah yes it was great as well, the whole trapped in a game, traumatising experience wrapping. But then, as I looked back at the second season it struck me. I hadn't seen it since I was a bit far away but, that wrapping had cow poop smeared all over it. Kirito's just a teenage boy, why does he have to investigate these crimes? I thought he was supposed to be traumatised, so why does he accept? Is Kirito insane in the membrane? Santa did me dirty on this one. What I thought would be a great present was just turned into disappointment and Christmas fluff. \\n\\n\r\nBut I was still optimistic. Maybe Santa just happened to stop in a barn recently and the stuff got on it by accident. Maybe there was a chance that the insides were still great! So I eagerly opened it up to see what was on the inside. Oh boy, what a surprise I was in for. The insides were half good, but because the other half was so bad, it just made everything else look bad. The fighting and animation of SAO was still top notch, as well as the soundtrack, meaning that the action was still action packed and thrilling. But for the plot, Santa had a sinister plan for me. For what seemed like a serious concept, SAO II's plot was filled with too many random moments that just destroyed anything serious about it. Kirito's interactions with Sinon were flirty and inappropriate. He even wore a female character model. Yes, just like SAO's plot, Kirito was dressed up to be way better than he actually was. What doomed Sword Art Online's first season was it's constant mucking around with female characters even though there was an established couple. It was much of the same in Sword Art Online II. Any compelling aspects of the murder mystery were turned into nonsensical goo as Kirito and Sinon drifted off to lala-land constantly under Asuna's nose. Thanks Santa, you big jerk. \\n\\n\r\nYou know when you get something that you didn't want for Christmas, and it's not even something good. It's something horrible. It's like getting a bag of only black liquorice jellybeans, it's dreadful and only takes away from your fantastic Christmas experience. That is what romance in Sword Art Online II was like. SAO tried to put in a few extra aspects to their present that were just not needed and horrendous. The first being the mindless \"rom-com\" aspects that I mentioned previously and now the actual romance. Santa must have had his thesaurus handy because this romance is... hold on I need a thesaurus myself. I'm running out of words to say bad and horrible. Ah yes, the romance is abhorrent and abominable (more than the snowman). Asuna and Kirito are pretty bad as a couple in the first place (there's nothing remotely interesting about them, especially since Asuna was reduced to a pile of weak generic female goo in season 1). But when Kirito is constantly fiddling around with other girls, it makes the whole thing laughable. SAO II is like a testosterone filled adolescent who can't help but ogle at the new girl on the street. Kirito must interact with every girl, yes. Kirito must show loyalty to Asuna only when the viewer is on the verge of giving up, yes. Maybe Santa wanted me to laugh myself to death on Christmas, because this is just too laughable. It just makes me feel the same as the moral system of Sword Art Online, hollow. \\n\\n\r\nAs if there was a cherry on top of my gift, Santa left me one last blasted and godforsaken  aspect to my gift. Kirito's character. Ah yes. I think I'm going to have to add some stronger stuff to my eggnog to get through this. Kirito is a strong character I get it. But this is ridiculous. He's invincible. Kirito might as well show up in the Bible as Jesus because I wouldn't be surprised if they were supposed to be the same person. Flashback to Kirito exploding into digitalised pieces and coming back together inexplicably in season 1. That feeling of Deus Ex Machina was not lost in Season 2. You'll know it when you get there but it's just pathetic. You can't develop a character that just wins every fight and dismantles people. It's the problem Mahouka fell to and now that SAO will fall to again. I'm sending a bomb to the North Pole for this one Santa, you're gonna regret giving me this for Christmas. \\n\\n\r\nLooking back, SAO II was a pretty bad present. But I can see why people would enjoy getting something like this. I mean SAO II has so many different aspects to it that it probably has something for everyone. It's a jack of all trades. In those combined 49 episodes and two seasons, there's a lot of different aspects to SAO. It could have chosen to be much less in a thematic stance, which may have made it much more in a content stance. And I'll give the creators credit where credit is due, most of this content is simply adapted from the light novels, so I guess that's where the root of the problem is. They've done a good job of adapting it. But Santa promised me a gift of a good series, and that is not what I got. The Mother's Rosario arc, yes it was alright. It was definitely a step in the right direction. But it was... too little too late from Santa because my Christmas was already long tainted. Sword Art Online II to its credit stays consistent in its overachieving attitude that falls short. But yeah, that's what SAO is at the end of the day. Not serious when it should be, disjointed and a bit sloppy. A jack of all trades, and most certainly a master of none. Merry Christmas to me. \\n\\n\r\nBut hey, as Christmas closes out, I'm sure we all have a lot to be thankful for. So whether Christmas is already over for you or you're waiting it out, enjoy the rest of your 2014 and beyond, MAL. \\n\\n\r\n\"So Kindle crept around in his lonely room,\\n\r\nSurrounded by the feelings of his holiday gloom,\\n\r\nSword Art Online II lingered in his mind,\\n\r\nIt wasn't very nice, it wasn't very kind\\n\\n\r\nFilled with potential to be a great show,\\n\r\nWhere it all went wrong he may never know,\\n\r\nBut for Kindle he had plenty of reasons to be happy,\\n\r\nHe we wouldn't let SAO make his mood crappy\\n\\n\r\nSo he promised to be better\\n\r\nAnd he mailed a nice letter\\n\r\nAddressed to Santa, the man behind the mess\\n\r\nWith a message he so dearly needed to confess.\\n\\n\r\n'Santa I know I can improve next year\\n\r\nSo I'll work hard instead of being in fear\\n\r\nI just hope that I'll be deserving of more\\n\r\nMore than this Sword Art Online bore'\" \\n\\n\r\nSAO has probably brought this community closer together, whether it be to hate it or to love it. For that, I thank it. Happy Holidays guys. \\n\\n\r\n\"Welcome, Christmas, bring your cheer. Cheer to all Whos far and near. Christmas Day is in our grasp, so long as we have hands to clasp. Christmas Day will always be just as long as we have we. Welcome Christmas while we stand, heart to heart, and hand in hand.\" - The Grinch",

            "content": "This review does not contain spoiler. It IS a spoiler, since I can't talk about anything without giving examples. And please don't walk away with a \"not helpful\" after reading only two lines, a little bit of respect and appreciation would be nice. :)\r\nWelcome to my review of Sword Art Online's Sequel, SAO 2. \r\nTo be completely honest, Sword Art Online was a very very entertaining show. To a certain extent even better than the first season. I tend to give generous scores to animes, but I'm afraid that even I am powerless this time around. Alright, time to put on my magic thinking capon and talk about this show a little bit. \\n\\n\r\nAll constructive criticisms are welcomed and appreciated via PM or Comment. Please, I said \"criticism\", not complements or hates. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nGRAPHIC (Art 4/5, Animation 1/5)\\n\\n\r\nAs always, the art in SAO is very beautiful. And that's all. Nothing surprising, I can barely find any improvements comparing to the first season. GGO has some really cool graphic and the dark theme with well rendered, mysterious feeling lighting gives the atmosphere a nice touch. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is made of 80% recycled animation from the first season and millions of still images that last for more than 5 seconds each. The \"cool\" effects are made with the top tier CG engine, and all there is are the fancy light and aimers moving randomly on the screen just be cool. Seriously, it is 2014. I SAID TWENTY FOURTEEN. Just how cheap can the production be? it has all the budget in the universe and this is all the crap it gives? It doesn't even come close to Fate Zero. (Alright I'm a bit harsh on the scoring, it's just their lack of effort pisses me off)\\n\\n\r\nAnd I didn't get to see Kirito being a badass raid boss. Come on that's like the most exciting part, 1 dude vs. a guild.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (OP/ED 2/3, OST 2/3, Voice tone/style 3/4)\\n\\n\r\nThe theme songs in SAO 2 are quantity over quality. 3 OPs and 4 ED. All of them are fine songs. Created by well known singers with good reputation, all songs lacks any symbolic elements, which means none of them are memorable in anyway whatsoever. I mean, if you add the animations with them, I suppose they are good and fitting. But if I don't tell those SAO fans that the songs are from SAO, they wouldn't think they are exceptional songs. \\n\\n\r\nOST falls in the same category. Very good mixture of the symphony and vocal plus occasional electronic, but all things considered, they are slightly worse than the ones in the first season and it is definitely not going to be the songs I choose to listen when I'm driving. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors are up to their standard. The main problem is the dialogues are flat and boring. which makes the voice actor's effort go in vain. Dub is not out yet but I wouldn't expect much considering how it did in the first season.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS (Design 2/5, Development 0/5)\\n\\n\r\nTwo new characters are introduced, Shino and Konno. Shino is probably the my favorite character in the SAO universe. When she was introduced in the first episode, the first shot was on her face, the second was on her ass. She begins with rather promising personality and some mediocre backstories. But all the development she got was basically \"I'm not scared of holding a gun anymore\". \\n\\n\r\nKonno is a random character that Asuna randomly encounters and she just happen to randomly decide to join Konno's guild without asking Kirito's permission (INSOLENCE!). Her background is ever more mediocre and boring. Rather than a character, she is more like a tool that carries the little plot progression the author tries to push in.\\n\\n\r\nOh and I'm gonna briefly mention Kirito. He's got a whole arc to describe how he got more OP and all his girlfriends just happen to be all happy to make him more OP. Yup that's it. \\n\\n\r\nBy no mean these characters are not enjoyable. Afterall they all have a little bit of personalities and some redeemable characteristic. I liked those character, but they are very poorly developed. And no I'm not talking about their boobs. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY (Concept 2.5/5, Development 0.5/5)\\n\\n\r\nThe second season of sword art online has 3 arcs. \\n\\n\r\nThe first arc has the most creative and interesting concept among the three. Our mighty Hero Kirito needs to investigate a case in another video game call GGO. In this world, people kill one another with guns for fun. Of course Kirito just has to be the Jedi knight. (The light saber was an amazing idea IMO) But when a mysterious person, death gun, who demonstrate how he is able to kill people IN GAME grabs our protagonist's attention. I thought that was very cool concept. In this world, Kirito meets a good sniper and solves the Death Gun Mystery. Of course Shino joins his harem at the end. \\n\r\nThe Second arc Kirito leads his raiding team to obtain the legendary Excalibur. To date I still don't know what was the point of that arc. It has absolutely no purpose. \\n\r\nThe Third Arc concerns about a girl with cancer and how Asuna single handedly brings her back to life and invites her to join Kirito's Harem as a god damn camera. Why. Just why. \\n\\n\r\nSo, how did the story turn out? Straightforward and generic, boring and pointless. It has numerous flaws. \"Sure, SAO has its flaws. But at the end of the day, it was an interesting story with memorable characters\". Alright. Let us make this very clear: SAO 2 does not have flaws. I would go as far as say the entire season IS a flaw. Every single second of this show is forced with story for the sole sake of telling a story.The story is full of exaggerated themes that don't make any human sense (Kirito feels guilty for killing people in SAO now? But what has he be doing in the past 3 year when he was fcking with Asuna virtually?)\\n\\n\r\nIn the last arc, I tried something interesting: timeskiping the episodes so I \"complete\" each one in less than 5 mins. I didn't feel like I missed anything at all. Then I went back and watch them thoroughly. That was a bad decision since the 15 mins I skipped were absolutely unnecessary. \\n\\n\r\nI have not read the manga or the light novel. But from what I can see so far, MAYBE, the only part of this season that has a purpose is the foreshadowing of the laughing coffin's left over personals. \\n\r\nSAO is such an ambitious title. But I find that there is absolutely no point of talking about how the stories are executed when the entire plot is pointless to start with. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the 24-episode long anime has no plot. The development can be summarized with the following: Shino and Konno joins Kirito's harem, Laughing Coffin has leftovers. Kirito is now even more powerful. The creator of SAO made a machine that cures cancer. I can promise you that you won't feel missed out at all if you skip this season and watch the third when it comes out. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis is by no mean sarcastic. I actually enjoyed the series to the fullest extent. Kirito, despite being one of the most horribly designed characters, is extremely entertaining to watch. I mean, just who doesn't like seeing a protagonist being absolutely awesome? He is the essence of perfection, the symbol that will be held in every anime fan's head for eternity. The story, despite being poorly executed and pointless, is also pretty fun. The Thor's hammer was such a great idea and it make me laugh really happily. I would totally recommend it to anyone, since at the end of the day, it is a really nice piece of entertainment, even for stupidity's sake.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nJust so you know, I'm overrating this. \\n\\n\r\nAll hail Kirito. \\n\\n\r\nPeace.",

            "content": "They release game called SAO Fatal Bullet and I did not want to play it so at first I decided to watch SAO II so that after that it would be interesting to play, and yesterday i graduated (complete 24/24) and I was not satisfied with anime. Those who watched 4 years ago, these people (anime viewers) I fully understand, why many of them caused a low rating (like 3/10-6/10) ok... let's start with the main one.\r\nOP 1 intro 10/10- Song and animation just epic\r\nOP 2 intro 6/10- nothing special\r\nStory in overall 7/10- (1-15 episodes) I liked Gun Gale online, I wanted to see ituntil episode 24, but....... they switched to another mmorpg at first it seemed cool, because I was thinking that they would return to the gun gale online back, but that was not the case, 16-24 episode this part can be highly valued only and only true SAO fans, my raiting is 6/10 because there are too many soap operas and melodrama, especially in the last three episodes, the second part +/- is intended exclusively for real fans, but Gun Gale online I would say to all, who of course, have played computer games only so I liked the first part but not the second one.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10- Very well drawn, but animation in gun gale online I liked more.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10- Which really shocked me is the weapon sounds the feeling that they took the sound of real weapons, and when they fired from them, I already knew from what weapon they were shooting (pistol,shoutgun,sniper rifle, assault rifle and more), and music in general also liked.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10- Most of all I liked the Sinon despite being in her past where she defends itself and inadvertently kills a bad person she was acting right then I did not like the other people's reaction to the fact that she killed a man, except Asada Shino others in that moment was useless and weak, bad people MUST DIE! And in gun gale online Sinon was just a gift for me very pretty girl, but others like Asuna Kirito and they friends stay same as first season.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10- First part I watched 3 episodes every day and second part 1 episode every day.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10- Now I can start enjoying the game Sao Fatal Bullet and get into Sinon place and enjoy own Gun Gale Online.\\n\\n\r\nAnd bonus- Difficult to evaluate correctly, but from my own experience those, who play games using computer hardware, take an example from Sao heroes if you are weak in real life, but playing a computer game you feel strong then motivate yourself from the games to real life as it did in the end with Shino Asada.",

I didn't like the 2nd half of the season, basically everyone with exception of Asuna was put on the sidelines just like that, out of nowhere another group of kids come alone, and to be honest it just felt like you were forced to accept them, forced to accept that some girl came out of nowhere and is suddenly stronger than Kirito or Asuna. The biggest problem is because thier introduction feltso forced, there is little emotion when this new group that Asuna has deccided to play with wins a fight or are having a happy moment, or when there is a sad reveal. Yes, yes call me heartless, evil, nasty or whatever. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound - Gave it a 5, nothing really to talk about. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - I believe I have already stated my opinions regarding this new group Asuna has started playing with. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I only enjoyed the GGO part of the season, as I have said, it went downhill after that. \\n\\n",

            "content": "As promised I'm rewriting SAO II review.\r\nFirst of all, I question the point of making this season itself. This is just a shameful try to sell their lame story and make easy money, disgraceful at end because I felt offended by this show. I disliked it before, but now it just went shameless. \r\nWhy do they even call this anime Sword Art Online? Even 2nd part of first season was questionable why even existed. And now this? It's no way related to SAO main plot. What is this anime, some kind of \"slice of life\"? It's not even that. It's just some bunch of peopleplaying. I feel like show was over long ago when they finally logged out, and everything after that is just a filler to make money on something popular. The thing SAO is lacking is objective, story isn't driven by anything. And the reason is that they want this to be kept as \"franchise.\" They could make anime about GGO and Sinon, but they had to get Kirito in it. They just used SAO's popularity to sell this awful writing. I've been outraged a lot by the poor writing and lack of intelligence from the author, but never so much with what happened at the end of anime.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER!! \\n\\n\r\nKonno Yuuki dies from AIDS. Are they kidding us? Could they have not given better explanation why?! HOW?! Because it doesn't kill. AIDS doesn't kill people who are kept from danger like Konno Yuuki was. I really checked stuff a lot to be sure they said AIDS in anime. And believe me this is stupid. They could have said anything. Like, anything else to make it real.... You just... can't insult people like this...\\n\\n\r\nWhen I heard Sleeping Knight's backstory, I thought it was pretty touching and sad, and I wasn't going to say anything  bad about that part but killing somebody with AIDS pissed me off -.-' And after that I didn't also get what was the point of this \"filler\" part of story. How is this connected to SAO. If you're making a drama, ok, do it but don't label it with popular name and use half-assed story about terminally ill people. Why? To make it seem more \"dramatic\" and \"deep.\" Well, it would have been really much better if they made it into another anime. Like they should have also done with GGO part. But no, we have to get Kirito rubbed in our faces every time.... which brings second greatest flow of this anime - Characters. \\n\\n\r\nI said this before and I will say it again, Kirito is a cheater and has no quality as a character. He's just there so that story can revolve around him so that he seems really really cool and awesome. Other characters who should have gotten much more screen time, didn't get any... Klein is already just a joke not a character. \\n\\n\r\nThe only not horrible part this anime has it's production value. It's not really high but sound is good given Kajiura is making osts, and animation isn't half bad. And that's about it. Everything else with most animes is writing. Which is done really really poorly. I can't enjoy this anime even when I try too. \\n\\n\r\nIt had some good moment like when Sinon almost got raped/killed. It was pretty... intense. That scene got me really. It was really well done. But than they blew it with cheap luck and how Kirito survived that. That was just plain stupid. It really ruined the whole suspense. And SAO does that often. It's like a formula already for this anime where you build up good foundation and story and ruin it near the end with something stupid. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this 5/10 rating. It just makes me pissed off how they are making money with this. And knowing that there are gonna be some people crying about how good this anime was 'cause OMG YUUKI DIED SO SAD, VERY TOUCHING, MUCH PLOT... god... this anime's so cheap....",

            "content": "Lately, there's been a paradigm shift in the demand for reviews. Specifically: of the objective variety. I've been criticized in my writing for the use of personal feelings, opinions, and things like hyperbole and sarcasm. If the denizens of this site, in all their bounty of knowledge are the purveyors of reviewing wisdom that they claim to be, then I must have been doing it wrong all this time. So, with that said, I am going to review the anime Sword Art Online II, but completely devoid of emotions, untainted by my thoughts, and without the colors of my opinion getting in the way ofmutual understanding. \\n\\n\r\nPreface: \\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online II is an anime produced by A1 Pictures in 2014. It is the sequel to the 2012 anime Sword Art Online, also produced by A1 Pictures. It was directed by Tomohiko Itou, who also directed Sword Art Online I. Sword Art Online II has 24 episodes, and aired from July 5th, 2014, to December 20th, 2014. It has a score of 7.43, ranked #1824 in terms of scores given by 290,290 users at the time of this writing, and ranked #26 in terms of popularity. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online II has a plot, which involves a group of characters experiencing conflicts and resolutions in a series of arcs. This plot has an exposition, rising action, filler, climax, and a resolution. It's also divided up into three distinct arcs, which are titled Phantom Bullet, Calibur, and Mother's Rosario, which are the fourth, fifth, and sixth arcs respectively, of the overarching Sword Art Online story as a whole- as a continuation of the previous season, 2012's Sword Art Online. The world of Sword Art Online II takes place in both the real (Japan) and virtual worlds, which the characters access through the internet, in the form of a Virtual Reality Multi-Massive Online Role Playing Game (VRMMORPG). There are villains in the story with various motivations. There is a combination of action, drama, and adventure in the story. Some people may like this, and some people may not. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nThere are three main characters in Sword Art Online II. Kirito is a male, and is the main character of the franchise. Asuna Yuuki is the primary female protagonist, and returns from Sword Art Online I's cast, as well. The third character is a new female heroine named Sinon, who features prominently in the Phantom Bullet arc. There are other supporting characters in the show, and they are a combination of male, female, and artificial intelligence (AI). The main characters face decisions and conflict with other characters, and may or may not develop as characters. Some people may find that they experience developments, and some are of another mind. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation:\\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online II was produced with computer animation, as are all modern anime. It was drawn as a series of key frames on a screen by an animator in Japan, and then filled in with a program called an in-betweener. The animation features lights and color, and also has backgrounds to go along with the actions the characters make. There are contrasting colors, and there are complementary colors. The art style was directed by Yuusuke Takeda. Some people like his style, and some people do not. \\n\\n\r\nThere are also 13 explicit pans, shots, and stills of Sinon's Ass throughout the show. Given that there are 24 episodes, this comes out to be 0.542 shots of Sinon's Ass in each episode of Sword Art Online II.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting:\\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online II features music as well as voice acting. There are three opening themes in the show. Episodes 2-13 feature \"IGNITE\" by Eir Aoi, who is a pop singer. Episodes 15-23 feature \"courage\" by Haruka Tomatsu, who is also a pop singer. The final episode's (24) theme is \"Separate Ways\", also by Ms. Tomatsu, pop singer. The show also has four ending themes. The first theme is \"IGNITE\" by the aforementioend pop singer, Eir Aoi. It is used in episode 1, only. Episodes 2-14, or the first cour of the show feature Luna Haruna, a pop singer, who sings \"Startear\". LiSA, yet another pop singer featured as an artist in Sword Art Online II, sings \"No More Time Machine\" for episodes 15-17, and \"Shirushi\" for episodes 18-24. \\n\r\nSome viewers may enjoy the music directed by Yoshikazu Iwanami, and some may not. It's up to the individual to decide whether they find it pleasing or not. \\n\\n\r\nKirito, the main male character, is voiced by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka in Japanese, and Bryce Papenbrook in English. Asuna Yuuki, the primary heroine of the series, is voiced by the pop singer Haruka Tomatsu. In English, her counterpart is Cherami Leigh. Both of these voice actors are reprising their role from the first series, the 2012 anime Sword Art Online. Sinon is voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro in Japanese, and by Michelle Ruff in English.\\n\r\nThe other characters are voiced by voice actors in both Japanese and English. The show also has German, French, and Italian dubs. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, watchers of the show may enjoy the portrayal of these characters by these voice actors, and some may not. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is a purely subjective matter, and as such cannot be included in this review. Some people may enjoy this show, and some people may not. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Sword Art Online II is an anime that some people may like, and some others may not. Because it cannot be given a score differing from 5, which would, on the arbitrary scale of this website, indicate that it is either closer to a 10 or closer to a 1, This anime must be a perfectly neutral 5. It is neither a 10, nor is it a 1. It is neither boring nor exciting, well written nor poorly, pretty nor ugly, stupid nor smart, nor is it good or bad. \\n",

            "content": "\"The Virtual World is just a different form of reality.\"\r\nWelp, we didn't see it coming but here it fucking is. Sword Art Online II, somehow this show got a second season, I mean I understand the first season was popular but this, it just came out of nowhere. It's like, well, imagine you're throwing a frisby for your dog to catch, now that frisby is Sword Art Online. Usually the dog would take a bunch of seconds but instead, out of nowhere the frisby hits your face, thats Sword Art Online II for ya. So, did tis get better or worser? Well this is, OK.It's not good but its fair. The story is better now but with some major problems instead of failing everything. The Art is solid as usual but the music is pretty great with some stellar tunes. The Characters are pretty meh. And the enjoyment isn't just its mindless action shockingly.\\n\\n\r\nStory & Characters: 4.7/10\\n\r\nSo this time around there's this incident with a man known as \"Death Gun\" where its been reported that in game he'd shoot a certain person and well that person suddenly disconnects and well, they die in real life. Huh, its linear story with a bit of taking from S1, well at least this isn't a romance and harem right? Oh wait, fanservice, filler, bad pacing. Well lets give it a tick for not falling in romance or harem this time.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we have the Bland and Generic Character we all hate! Kirito. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH YOU SUCK! YOU SUCK! YOU JACKASS! Alright everyone calm down so, first off he's still as bland but secondly, later on we realize that he is suffering from his past which is a good idea, the fact that some of thhe stuff is happening is related to the previous season is smart! But that dosen't make up for him still being bland.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have ass- I mean Sinon. When we first see Sinon she's proning as we see the best part about her which is DAT ASS! *nosebleeds* Hell, when we're first introduced to her we see her ass and a space for her va-gi-nq which looks really weird..... Is this falling for the ecchi genre now? Like Sinon's ass could make this an ecchi, now apart from her buutiful and luxurious round ass. Well, she's intresting, we find out as a child she murdered a man to save her own mother and after that she has been bullied on and only has one friend...intresting right? And when she ever holds a gun she barfs or passes out however in the game she dosen't feel that. Man I like this character!  But, remember what happened to Asuna in Season 1, yeah that happens to her, as soon as she meets Kirito she first hates him then falls for him later on *sigh* and she becomes a little weaker like, Asuna. Oh Kirito, are you thou sexy? Or thou this logic lazy? Either waya lot of potential is wasted on an interesting character.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nLike last season the art is nice. Amazing visuals. Shockingly not sloppy in some scenes. Overall, good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nNow, the music, please marry me. The music is so enjoyable, both OPs and EDs are well done and really noice. It really fits the show and is really nice to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nSadly, there isn't as much action, but, plot-twists. These things are what keep you on your feet, literally without these this show would've gotten a 4. But when something tense or bad happens you go \"OH PAPER SHEETS!\" and it gets you on your feet, there isn't much action but when it happens, its mindless and enjoyable as ever.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nThis was OK. There wasn'tmuch improvement but this was pretty OK, for a sequel this is much better than it's predeccesor. The ending shockingly, was a cliffhanger...so theres gonna be a chance of an SAO III.....hehe, uh, yeah I so did not just punch 10 holes in my wall and flip 16 tables. *sigh* So, should you watch this? Well, I guess you can give it a go, other than that there's not too much change here. Well A-1, you tried, and if you make an SAO III, please make it good at least? Thanks. \\n\\n\r\nRating: You tried.\\n",

            "content": "Sword Art Online is a series that always seems to stir up some controversy among the anime community.  After rewatching the first season last month I honestly contemplated not delving into the second whatsoever.  I was THAT disappointed.  Sometimes you get wrapped up in the hype of an anime but you tend to look past the aggregious amount of plot holes and bland characters.  SAO II was good at times, and at others I almost forced myself to watch it.  Ducking for cover from fanboys, I'll make my attempt at a review while it's still fresh in my mind.\r\nJust whenI thought it couldn't get any more disappointing than the first season, SAO II came in hobbling toward the finish line.  Gun Gale Online was such an interesting concept: Badass looking characters, havoc-wreaking weapons and a tournament to determine who really was the best gunblazing battle fiend of them all.  Throw in a sexy, pixie-haired protagonist and you've got blueprints for success right?  Not..... exactly.  Well, not at all actually.  Shit's gotten real in Gun Gale Online.  Some of the best players are being killed off in the game, including the winner of the most recent 1v1 ultimate badass tournament.  The kicker?  Players are not only clocking out in-game, but are found deceased in real life as well.  Enter Kirito, our harem hero from the first season.  Naturally he is called upon to investigate this tragic state of affairs, and of course he obliges to help.  He doesn't exactly tell his girlfriend Asuna what he's doing, but her third grade intellect uncovers the truth as the season progresses.  \\n\\n\r\nThe other side of the story involves Sinnon, a bodacious babe with a mean looking sniper rifle whose past haunts her with the intensity of a Stephen King novel.  When she was younger, she managed to shoot and kill a criminal with a gun to protect her mother and is forever followed by the burden.  But just like the nonsensical approach Kirito had to enter a game where real people are dying TWICE, Sinnon enters Gun Gale Online to confront her fear of guns by killing people with..... GUNS?!  What the hell is wrong with these people?\\n\\n\r\nAs the story transpires, Kirito enters the world of GGO as a convert ALO character, looking like a teenage boy going through their awkward stages in life.  I still have trouble buying this whole \"converted character\" ruse.  Are all of these VRMMO's owned by the same monopolistic company?  What gives people!?  All ridiculousness aside, even if we buy the fact that Kirito is converted.... than why the hell does he have to look so much like a girl?  I have a feeling it was written this way to give him a viable excuse to become insta-friends with Sinnon.  Because of course, they meet no longer than 5 minutes after he enters the world.  Sinnon ends up helping Kirito out with the early stages of GGO, and with no surprise to anyone... Kirito is an instant badass.  Within his first logged session, he manages to beat an impossible minigame in the main city.  This earns him instantaneous fame and money in-game.  Go figure, he's probably already the best player in the game.  The funniest part is when he goes to buy an \"energy sword\" (key word for 'light saber').  Copyright officials would probably just laugh at how obvious this is... I mean they even have the same sound effects.\\n\\n\r\nI won't divulge the continued plot for obvious spoiler reasons, but it's kind of crap.  So many unanswered questions, so many made-up flashbacks to fit the story line.  Oh, and did I mention that it has a second part to the season?  I basically had the same reaction to the second half of SAO II as I did in SAO.... \"Are you fricking kidding me?!\"  Not the damn elves again!  After the unnecessarily short first arc, the writers managed to cram two more shit-tastic ones into 10 episodes! YuYu Hakusho only had 25 or-so episodes to unfold the Sensui storyline, and barely managed to get it right.  So what made them think that an average of 5 was kosher???  Bad move guys, bad move.  One good flash of brilliance was the absence of Sugguha's love affair with her sort-of brother.  Thank God, I don't think I could've stomached one more incestual monologue from her.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond all, there was no official closure from the first arc.  It's not even a damn cliffhanger.  To be a cliffhanger would be to imply that it was well written in the first place.  But to say that there is another potential enemy on the loose and then flash forward to a completely separate story arc is asinine to say the least.  That one takes the cake for me when it comes to the sloppily put together story.  There are just so many swings and so many misses with SAO II's story it's not even funny.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I scored this category low, it doesn't mean that all the characters were bad.  I still loved Klein from the first season, and Sinnon is actually a semi-complex addition to the sea of deadweight characters.  She has a somewhat believable past, and her initial standoffish relationship with Kirito is decent.  Of course Kirito eventually gets to her, and the two of them share an awkward flirtatiousness during the tournament.  Not to mention all the random shots of her butt dimples.  Can't scream \"forced fanservice\" any louder than that I guess.  During the resolution of the first half of the season, she unwinds even more... revealing an ending that can make the more sappy of fans fulfilled.  Unfortunately, she doesn't play nearly as big of a role in the second half of the season.  Sigh, just another reason to complain about those arcs.\\n\\n\r\nI'm going to preface the next paragaph by directing you to my original SAO review where I discuss how I felt about the relationship between Kirito and Asuna.  This will be more or less the same opinion, just to the extreme.  I just don't get it.  To quote Billy Bob Thornton in Bad Santa, \"God d*&#it, are you f!*@ing with me?!\"  It's one thing to claim that you have a couple in an anime, but it HAS to be somewhat believable.  They've got the cheesy one-liners down pat, I'll at least give them that.  But there's no genuine sense of romance whatsoever.  I mean, they have a kid (sort-of) for crying out loud! I mean, I'm pretty sure that Asuna could see Kirito macking on Sinnon throughout the entire GGO tournament, and she didn't seem the least bit jealous.  But the harem that Kirito built around himself sure showed envy every time he winked Asuna's way.  Gag me.  And now I'll step off of my soap box.\\n\\n\r\nI really had some hope at the beginning of SAO II that Kirito's personality and motives had developed since he was last trapped within the VRMMO world.  I was wrong, again.  He's a likeable super badass, but that's about all he has going for him.  The worst part of it all is when I realized how bad the other characters were, transitioning into the 3rd arc... when Kirito played more of a supporting character.  The relationship between Asuna and her mother during Mother's Rosario was probably the most \"real\" thing in the whole show for me.  It wasn't bad.  I found myself really feeling for Asuna as her matriarch disemboweled her ideas for the future.  It kind of reminded me of the struggles I went through growing up.   The one major difference between the situations was that I couldn't change my mom's mind by strapping a headset on her and transporting her to a comfy log cabin in the middle of lala land while reminiscing about things past.  Uggh...\\n\\n\r\nI don't want to offend anyone, but I also felt that Yuuki was weak.  Granted it wasn't entirely her fault, the writers spent like 38 seconds developing her character.  I really wanted to feel for her, but the emotions just couldn't reach me.  Everything was rushed, and I found myself looking ahead to see the remaining episodes wondering where the hell they were going with all of it.  Her guild friends also could've been expounded upon tenfold.  GIVE ME TIME TO GET ATTACHED TO THE DANG CHARACTERS!\\n\\n\r\nAgain, I hate saying that this was the most enjoyable part of the anime... but it was.  If the art style was bad, I have a strong feeling that this anime would not be nearly as popular as it is.  For it to be unbearable would be an understatement.  To that end, the environments are vast and vividly detailed.  The character designs are close to flawless, and slightly improved upon the original SAO.  I thought it was cool how they would show the bullet travel out of Sinnon's Hecate II sniper rifle.  It reminded me a bit of that late 2000's movie \"Wanted\" where they curve the bullets.  Pretty nifty if you ask me.  As with the good, the bad flutters in as well.  I did NOT like that floating squid looking thingamajigger.  I don't know what the hell it was, but the way it moved was creepy.\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening was amazing as well.  I love how it starts off with the powerfully erupting vocals, then slowly adding in piano.  Simply breathtaking.  The 2nd opening was not nearly as good, and I often found myself skipping it.  The rest of the show's sound effects were great, and background music made me not want to rip out my eyeballs.\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely hate the idea of giving an anime a 4/10, but I feel like there's no other route to meander on here.  SAO II, much like it's predecessor, suffered from lazy writing and static character development.  There were some good moments, but nearly enough to offset the rubbish ones.  Can someone tell these guys to just stick with one arc per season?  The second and third arcs were entirely unnecessary and rushed.  I mean, what WAS the point of the Excalibur one?  Just to show the viewers that Sinnon got included into the super badass harem possee'?  I know I'm not alone in this argument, I've seen other irritated reviews of this anime.  I really, really want to like this anime... especially now that I am 48 cumulative episodes committed.  If there IS a third season, which with all the fanboyism I do expect, I hope the writers adhere to our criticisms and make it a good anime.",

            "content": "There isn't much to be said about SAO 2 that hasn't already been said by most reviews here. However, the reason i found the motivation to write this review is because i found some enjoyment in the final arc that deserves some recognition.\r\nFirst of all, Kirito is still a god that can do absolutely everything for no reason at all. This includes ignoring game mechanics and whipping out a sword in a shooter to cut bullets. \r\nI don't even know what to say about this, its like if you are good at playing Devil May Cry, you can whip out a knife and start killingdudes in Counter Strike. Complete utter nonsense. All the ladies want to sleep with him including his sister, seriously i want to vomit every time i hear his voice or see his face, its that bad.\\n\\n\r\nNot just that, he seems like the only male in the show that isn't awkward, clumsy, perverted or a rapist murderer. The other guys in the show that has any sort of screen time all fall into these categories. So not only is he a god, every other guy is a complete unappealing scumbag.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway i'll talk briefly about the first two arcs.\\n\\n\r\nGGO: Supposed to be about a murder mystery, a guy called Deathgun (roflmao, get it, cause he kills people) is killing people in game and they actually die in real life. The premise itself is ok i guess but Kirito has to ruin everything by being an OP piece of ****. \\n\\n\r\nWhats funny is they actually tried to give him some sort of character by making it seem that he has PTSD from killing dudes in SAO. Oh but guess what he gets over it in 5 minutes, solves the murder mystery with absolutely no evidence, beats the bad guy and gets the girl. Whoopiee ****ing doo.\\n\\n\r\nThe girl mentioned, is Sinon and her character is actually appealing, with actual trauma and reasons for playing GGO. Oh too bad Kirito is around so shes really just a damsel in distress., who eventually wants to sleep with Kirito.\\n\\n\r\nCalibre: This arc is a complete waste of time. Its Kirito and his Harem completing a quest. Seriously thats all it is. At least in GGO theres a murderer running loose, here theres absolutely no reason to care about anything. \\n\\n\r\nWhats funny is they actually tried to force to the audience some idea of consequence if they fail the quest. Get this, the AI boss will run rampant and destroy ALO world Deathwing style. What are the developers or mods doing? Oh who gives a ****, screw this arc.\\n\\n\r\nMother's Rosario: The final arc of the show. This is why i actually wanted to write this review. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike the other arcs, i actually found this to be truly enjoyable. Why? Well, the main character isn't Kirito for once, thanks the gods. It chronicles the adventures of Asuna and her friend Yuuki. Kirito appears a bit as a side character, which is fine but would be better if he never appears at all. Seriously pls go away.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike calibre and GGO, the consequences and weight of the virtual world is neither over the top or irrelevant. I will go a bit into spoilers here. Skip to the end paragraph for a summary if you want to avoid it.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Yuuki is a character in the game known as Absolute Sword, the strongest player. At first, she seems like a perky upbeat person playing a video game. You follow them clearing a quest at first which seems to have no consequence. However, fact is that Yuuki is terminally ill and bed ridden and it was her way of leaving a memory in the only world she can be active and happy in.\\n\\n\r\nWhat follows is a pretty fascinating tale and ideas on how virtual reality can provide the ill with a world they can move freely in. I find it sad and intriguing when watching Yuuki's character, who had been living in virtual worlds for years. The transition from seeing her as the strongest swordsman in her world to a sick bed ridden girl in the real wold is truly heart breaking.\\n\\n\r\nYet unlike the other arcs, all of these feels natural, and believable that virtual reality would in fact have applications of medicine should it truly exist. This is where the sci fi appeal of virtual aspect of SSO shines, where ideas of future technology creating thoughtful scenarios and characters. Such as a girl living in virtual world for years.\\n\\n\r\nThe only complain i have in this arc is its too short. In part due to the other crap arcs i guess, so it does have certain pacing issues. I would have liked more time with these characters, especially Yuuki.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, there is too little SAO2 has overall to justify a complete watch. A lot of times there were cringe worthy moments that makes me want to shut off the show. However the last arc does kinda redeem the show a little, to show what could have been if the author would just stop sucking Kirito's wang for 2 minutes. Most if not all of the score goes towards this arc, which sadly, is the smaller proportion of the show.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend watching the last arc of the show, which starts around episode 19. Dont worry about the other arcs, they have absolutely no consequences, character development, and the main heroine of GGO simply becomes one of Kirito's harem in the end.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.\r\nThere's no way to review Sword Art Online that won't piss someone off, so I might as well come out and say it and piss of both the fandom AND the hatedom:\r\nThis wasn't as bad as the first one.\r\nBoth of the two main arcs of Sword Art Online II (disregarding the mini-arc inbetween the two) actually manage to fix a major problem with their predecessors, creating an overall better experience in the process. Unfortunately, they make new and different mistakes instead.\r\nThe series begins with Gun Gale Online. Surprisingly, this was neither as aggressively boring nor as aggressively bad as either previous arc,and was downright enjoyable in places - in particular, Episode 2, an episode shown to introduce the new game and a new major character, butt done with no prior context and holding over nothing from the rest of the series. It focuses on the tactics of the game and is rather interesting to watch, especially as it sets up new character Sinon as quite the bad-ass.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual concept of Gun Gale Online is pretty good too - the setup of a game in which people who die also die in real life, butt AREN'T supposed to was great, and gives the show a sense of much-needed tension that was absent from ALO in particular. Bringing back a member of Laughing Coffin was also a good idea, and so are the parallels drawn between Sinon's PTSD and Kirito's regrets over killing LC members in SAO.\\n\\n\r\nButt the problem this time around is not the ideas, butt the execution.\\n\\n\r\nKirito's absolute despair over having killed people in SAO comes completely out of left field and breaks the suspension of disbelief heavily. Him going from no mention of it whatsoever to a full-blown nervous breakdown is ridiculous. They try to play it off with the excuse that he had been \"trying to forget it\", butt trying to forget something is not the same as just conveniently not remembering it.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the idea that somehow, Sinon is fine with handling guns in GGO even though she can't handle them in real life.\\n\\n\r\nThat doesn't make sense.\\n\\n\r\nI know most of you are going to say \"well, that's the point!\", butt that doesn't fly with me. Just because something was intentional doesn't mean it was a good idea. If you pissed on a meal you were cooking, and people complained that the meal tasted like piss, you couldn't exactly get away with saying it's supposed to taste like that, could you? Anyway, the point is, I could accept a funny little twist on things like that if the show ever actually gave us a reason for it, butt it doesn't. We're just supposed to accept the usual answer: \"Because it does\". The irony is that this same show then tries to make a point of virtual reality being the same as actual reality, at least on a sensory level.\\n\\n\r\nHell, Sinon in general is kind of a bad character - she's basically the same deal as most SAO girls. Supposedly strong, butt for some reason reduced to a mere damsel in distress for Kirito to add to his harem, at one point literally begging Kirito to save her whilst whining like a spoilt child. The only thing she is genuinely good for in the plot is as exposition (well, that and one other thing).\\n\\n\r\nAnd even having her as a harem character is a pointless thing to do in of itself, because KIRITO IS FUCKING MARRIED. There is no point in adding other characters that he might potentially do the frick with if he is in a committed relationship already and is clearly not going to do the frick with anyone else. Harem anime are one of the worst things in the whole damn medium of anime, and SAO can't even get that right!\\n\\n\r\nYou know the real point of having Sinon in this show? Yeah, of course you fucking know it. Everyone knows it. I jokingly referred to the first season as \"Sore Arse Online\", but this time around it's more like \"Sweet Ass Online\".\\n\\n\r\nThe show isn't even trying to be subtle about it. It's just saying \"yeah, like I give a fuck. Don't even act like you're not enjoying this.\" The camera sometimes pans to that glorious ass and back again for no discernable reason other than fanservice. Dramatic moments are even shown from the cleft of those glorious, firm cheeks.\\n\\n\r\nThere is, of course, one other reason for Sinon to exist, and that is because of her link to the extremely obvious big bad's true identity. Man, what are the odds that the first person Kirito would meet in GGO happens to be friends with the very person he is here to hunt? What a crazy random happenstance.\\n\\n\r\nIt's obvious in every way. Because seriously. There is no point in Deathgun being mysterious if it isn't someone we already know. There is no reason he would caress that photo of Sinon if it wasn't someone who knew Sinon. And there is no reason for his character to even exist if he ISN'T Deathgun. Fuck, he's even in the same room as Kirito right before Deathgun appears, and is mysteriously absent from the moment Deathgun starts talking to Kirito. He also keeps shooting meaningful glances at Kirito. Oh, and you want the best part? Look at the OP sequence. It literally fades from him into Deathgun. As if it were almost trying to be clever about it. Which it might actually have been if it wasn't obvious!\\n\\n\r\nAnd here's the kicker - there is also no way that Kyouji would be allowed to exist in this show unless he were later forcibly be removed... because he is an obstacle to Sinon being a member of Kirito's incredibly pointless harem. No male in this show is allowed to be any remote kind of threat to Kirito's ultimate sexual dominance, being that this show is the ultimate wish fulfilment tool for lonely teenage boys. It kind of raises awkward questions about the writer, butt then again this is the same guy who wrote Kirito's sister as a love interest, and then there's the whole \"glopping\" thing, so this isn't exactly a new low. Butt then, just to demonstrate how NO MALE OTHER THAN KIRITO CAN BE ALLOWED TO BE SEXY, it does the same bullshit as ALO and makes the villain super rapey and incredibly uncomfortable, also driving in the point that OH MY GOD THIS VILLAIN IS BAD. You don't have to force the idea that he is bad down my throat - You had me at \"murderer\".\\n\\n\r\nButt anyway, regarding Kirito's unthreatenable harem, this brings me back to the ultimate problem with SAO that has returned from the first season - Kirito is monumentally godmodded. He enters the game, knows nothing, and immediately kicks more ass than every other player combined, no matter how illogical his plans, like running headlong into a hail of fucking bullets like the vengeful ghost of Leeroy fucking Jenkins himself. Kirito cannot fail, because the writers like him too much. There is no tension whatsoever, because there is no doubt that Kirito will succeed. The worst point is when he gets stuck with a deadly neurotoxin needle, only to discover that he had a fucking electrode in the EXACT SPOT THE NEEDLE HIT AND NOWHERE ELSE WHATSOEVER. As if the concept that Kirito was at any risk was not already nonexistent, this seemingly happened just to prove that very point beyond a doubt.\\n\\n\r\nMOVING ON.\\n\\n\r\nDisregarding the mini-arc inbetween the two main ones, because nobody particularly cared about that arc and it could have been left out entirely without any fuss, the other main arc is the Sleeping Knights arc - probably the better of the two.\\n\\n\r\nThe core plot of the Sleeping Knights arc is actually, dare I say it, good. It's a clever piece of worldbuilding focusing on the other sci-fi implications of the series' FullDive technollogy - in this case, the medical implications. It also does itsself a service by building this story arc around an emotional character arc with a surprisingly likeable character who doesn't fall victim to any of this series' typical character writing tropes. The whole arc leads to a surprisingly satisfying finale.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is the path it takes to get there. For a start, the lack of any real-world ramifications to the gameplay was exactly what the problem was with the first ALO-centric arc, and they've repeated it here with even lower stakes. And while cutting Kirito out of the series for the vast majority of the arc and making someone else the protagonist was certainly an improvement, Asuna is by no means a more compelling character, and creating a pointless subplot about Asuna and her oppresive mother, full of teenage angst, was a questionable choice to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Sword Art Online II improves on the first series in some places but makes it worse in others. Overall a slight improvement, butt that's not much consolation for the second season of a show that should have ended halfway through its first.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, butts. Don't know if I mentioned butts.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words: Butts.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 2/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 7/10\\n\r\nMusic: 5/10\\n\r\nActing (JP): 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nFor Fans Of: Log Horizon, No Game No Life",

            "content": "The second season of S.A.O. was really strange, the reason why is:\r\n1st  part Gun Gale Online -   9/10\r\n2nd part Excalibur Quest -    7/10\r\n3rd  part Mother's Rosario -  6/10\r\nIn Gun Gale Online they give you a complete new game with a really interesting plot - pursuiting Death Gun, a person that shoots another person in-game (with a \"special\" pistol) and that person dies in real life. Inside this game Kirito meets a girl player named Sinon, who introduces him to the game, Sinon is an awesome character in GGO with a great design and her abilities who tiein a certain way to events of her real self. During the 13 episodes of this part Kirito becomes closer to Sinon and almost anyone who watched S.A.O. II has that \"screw Asuna we want Sinon+Kirito\" kinda thoughts, and the \"hidden romance\" between them mixed with all the other aspects of the anime makes it really unique and really great, keeping you pumped to watch every episode. And that's where the \"break\" comes in.\\n\r\nYou finish the Gun Gale Online phase and they stop playing the game to go reunite with Asuna and the other at Alfheim. And that's when the anime loses almost everything, in my onpinion, it gets boring, loses all the hype on Sinon, I completely lost the interest to watch it until the end, but I did it anyways.\\n\\n\r\nIn excalibur quest, Kirito and the crew (now with Sinon) go to a dungeon where they have to fight through some monsters and a HUGE boss to get Excalibur. In this part you witness the last Kirito+Sinon ties.\\n\\n\r\nIn Mother's Rosario the main character becomes Asuna and you follow her as a member of a new guild with the most poweful player in the game who has something \"special\" (on the bad side) in real life. This part also shows problems of Asuna and her mother in matters of her professional future.\\n\\n\r\nThis concludes my Sword Art Online II review. In my opinion just watch Gun Gale Online, but if you are like me and you \"have\" to watch it to the end because you already saw half of it, then watch it and you might hate or even like the rest of it.\\n\\n\r\nBye (^_^) \\n\\n\\n",

This second season openned with the story of BoB, which was an amazing story that linked very well both virtual and real worlds. The season has finished with Mother's Rosario's story, which has also been very good (I even cried with the end).\r\nOnce said all this, why not a 10? Why a 9? Well, Between both stories there was Excalibur's arc. For me, this arc was horrible. It had a great lack of sense andit looked like \"we have 3 episodes empty, what do we create for them?\" \"we could make a short terrible story so we don't have to think much\". This arc is what for me makes SAO II not worth a 10.\\n\\n\r\n(If there were some mistakes I'm sorry, I'm Spanish and I had never written a review before)",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nThe technology we experience in this day and age is marvelous. Incredible medical advances, personal computers the size of our hands, and sensory perception devices have already become the norm. The more we improve upon this technology, the further the line between reality and virtual is skewed. It's a fascinating development that holds a plethora of implications unknown to people even twenty years ago. These implications can either bring terrible trauma or untold happiness. In Sword Art Online 2, both sides are investigated, leaving us with an overall improvement from the first season.\r\nSTORY\r\nSword Art Online 2 starts whereSword Art Online finished: Kirito, Asuna, and the rest of the gang have been happily living their lives outside of Aincrad for a while now. However, one day, Kirito is tasked with the mission to investigate an online killer known as \"Death Gun,\" who is seemingly capable of killing people in the real world from within the virtual.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the outset, Sword Art Online 2 has rather big shoes to fill, considering the popularity of the previous season. This time around, the anime focuses on three separate arcs: Phantom Bullet, Excalibur, and Mother's Rosario. What's different this time around is not just in the amount of stories that are told, but rather in their execution. Namely, the tales are not world driven but instead character driven. Phantom Bullet explores Sinon, Excalibur demonstrates the group dynamic, and Mother's Rosario takes a look at Yuuki. This provides the show with an opportunity for greater characterization, emotional appeal, and depth that was sorely lacking from the initial season.\\n\\n\r\nThe first and largest portion for this season comes from the Phantom Bullet arc. Here, the anime adopts an exposition-heavy approach that poses a stark contrast to much of what the first season offered. This direction slows everything down, providing the characters with more time to elaborate on not only the situations at hand but on their personal beings. At the same time, it attempts to find a balance between dialogue and battles that isn't quite found. Often times, there either exists too much talking with little progress or too much fighting with little explanation. Both sides as presented work as intended, but in unison they constantly seem to clash.\\n\\n\r\nThe second story is the shortest among both seasons. Entitled Excalibur, it doesn't serve much purpose other than providing a bit of fan-service to fans of the series. Deep down, it's meant to showcase the cast working together, but their isn't much weight behind these events, leaving it as fun rather than fulfilling.\\n\\n\r\nThe final adventure, and arguably the strongest part of Sword Art Online to date, is Mother's Rosario. This time, the anime gets it right; finding that balance between fighting and character exposition, it weaves a story filled with incredible emotions and an endearing message. Talking more about this balance, this arc uses the battles not as a means to survive or to demonstrate the power of the characters. Rather, they are utilized to shape the people at play and provide the audience with the idea that people can be defined by more than what reality provides us. That there exists more to someone than what is at first perceived.\\n\\n\r\nThematically, and perhaps obviously, Sword Art Online 2's overall message is simple: finding the strength in oneself. The strength to not give up, the strength to keep fighting even in the face of impossible odds, the strength to understand that one is more important and special than he or she ever thought possible. Again, this ties into both the real and virtual worlds within Sword Art Online, and has connections to our own. Having such strength is never easy to come by, but once it is found, it's a beautiful feeling that can never be replaced.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe production values, as expected, are quite high within Sword Art Online 2.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style stays more or less the same from the first season. The environments depicted are rife with detail, with locations both old and new looked upon. The bustling city within Gun Gale Online, the lone oak tree in Alfheim, and the snow-covered cabin where Kirito, Asuna, and Yui call home are prominent examples of how scenic the world can be.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are also given much attention. Kirito sees a face-lift in all departments and the newly introduced characters are given their own flair and details that allow them to slide easily into the pact.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation remains strong, with well choreographed duels, sword action, bullet-dodging, various move-sets, differing abilities, and both short and long-range skirmishes. Seeing as part of the allure to Sword Art Online are the fun and often intense battle sequences, it's no wonder that a lot of time was spent in this department.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's nothing absolutely beautiful to look at or a prime example of how art and animation is to be done, but it is nice to see consistent quality across the board.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAs stated before, Sword Art Online foregoes world building and sets its sights on the characters at hand.\\n\\n\r\nSimultaneously the most loved and hated guy in anime, Kirito is back in full force during the first half of the show. Powerful yet understanding, he often talks with his swords first and his words later. However, contrary to his stigma, he actually receives a development that grounds him to reality. Seeing the all-mighty, over-powered main character succumb to a completely human feeling was refreshing to see, even if it only lasted for a short time.\\n\\n\r\nNot to be outdone, Asuna takes up her rapier once more in the second half. Beautiful, kind, and intelligent, she's a woman every man dreams of finding. Beginning as a bad-ass, experiencing an oft forgotten misstep, and settling as an independent young woman, it seems there isn't much left to do with her character. But as the Mother's Rosario arc reveals, there is. The turmoil and struggle she experiences internally mirrors that of Kirito. She wants to have her feelings be known, but she doesn't have the capability to do so. This is mostly attributed to the circumstances that surround her life.\\n\\n\r\nBoth Kirito and Asuna develop past their troubles for one reason: their respective partnership with the characters they meet. In other words, Sinon and Yuuki provide the strength that Kirito and Asuna need to overcome the issues that plague them. Our couple serve as an example of not finding such strength within yourself, but having it given or revealed to you.\\n\\n\r\nSinon, the star of Gun Gale Online and arguably the strongest character this season, is a young woman attempting to overcome a past that torments her. Masking her beauty with that of a cool aura, she is always looking to better herself. For her, there is a distinction that exists between the virtual and the real world, and it is this separation that is tested. While she may be sexualized more so than is necessary, there is no denying the development she undergoes and the experiences she has fighting alongside Kirito. For her, the strength to keep fighting, the strength to move on gives her a welcoming feeling of relief that demonstrates what Sword Art Online can do when focusing so well on characterization.\\n\\n\r\nLast, but certainly not least, Yuuki is a jubilant, fun, and all-around friendly young woman known for her swordplay that is rivaled only by that of Kirito and Asuna. Her loyalty knows no bounds, and her smile can cure the saddest of hearts. While she exudes a tough outer exterior, the emotions she keeps bottled inside can be too much for her to handle. As her story progresses, more and more is revealed about the almighty \"Zekken,\" leading her down a path that provides us the already re-iterated message of finding one's strength. For Yuuki, this strength is the strength to understand that everyone, regardless of their background, has something to contribute. The contribution may not be physical, but even so it will exist for years to come within the hearts of those it touched.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe first OP is the best of the bunch, hearkening back to season one's \"Crossing Field.\" The guitar and drums provide resounding flourishes, and the tune is incredibly catchy to hear. Plus, the vocalist provides great depth and range, giving the song both highs and lows that make it a joy on each new listen.\\n\\n\r\nThe second OP is good, if not as grand as the first. The vocalist this time takes a more relaxed approach, with the guitar and drums once more providing the beat necessary to make the piece as lively as needed. It's both uplifting and sorrowful at the same time, adding to the atmosphere that permeates Mother's Rosario.\\n\\n\r\nThe first ED is quite good. It's a quiet piece, with the piano adding to the gracefulness that the visuals provide. The vocals are peaceful and hopeful, much like the first arc of this season.\\n\\n\r\nThe second ED earns last place. It's quick in nature, with a somewhat boring beat, even if the vocalist attempts to save the song from being as tame as it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe third and final ED is a beautiful piece, and arguably the strongest of the bunch. Starting slow and soft, eventually picking up both tempo and power, it evokes great emotion. The violins, piano, and music provide a stellar arrangement that makes it tough to listen to after all is said and done.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack brings about new pieces and returning favorites, making each depicted scene more fun, tense, or emotional than they would be on their own. Big shout-out to Yuki Kajiura for her continued work in the field of music.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting sees each cast member performing at least average to above average. While there are no superb performances to be had, each actor and actress did what was needed to be done.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nIt is impossible to deny the popularity of Sword Art Online. The characters are fun, their interactions are silly, the romance elements are nice, the inside jokes of established harems and whether or not Klein is actually the main character make the entire experience more worthwhile. It's a \"gateway\" series that can be loved by anime watchers both young and old, and it does this remarkably well.\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc add tons of action, even if it was rather slow at times. It wasn't extremely enjoyable, but watching Kirito flip around with a light-saber just because he can never ceased to make me smile. The Excalibur story, while technically not the weakest part of the entire series, was just a fun little side adventure. Admittedly, other anime did/do this better (namely, Log Horizon), but seeing the show at least attempt to incorporate more MMO elements was nice to see.\\n\\n\r\nI'll say it, I welled up during the finale of Mother's Rosario. I even still have the little tissues I used to dab my eyes. It was probably the same amount of emotion that was evoked the multiple times it occurred during Clannad: After Story. That's how moving it was. And it was moving not just because of Asuna or Yuuki. It was moving because of how together it all felt. While the arc didn't last long, I don't think I'll be able to forget about it for quite a while.\\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online 2 is a proper sequel. More action, more emotions, more characters; it does it all. While still far from perfect, I think the unending bashing of the series should at least calm down for the time being. While the story of Kirito, Asuna, and everyone else concludes for now, I can't wait to experience more of what this world, both the real and virtual, have to offer.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, okay first arc, bad second arc, good last arc\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, scenic locations, good actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Kirito, Asuna, and Yuuki are okay, Sinon is good\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, good OPs, great EDs, great soundtrack, good VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, begins with action but ends with emotion\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "I have to say, I really disagree with the masses about SAO II. \r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story, for the most part, had meaning--albeit points of random filler which I did not appreciate, especially since it left even less time for the actual story, which many agree is rushed at times. \r\nCON: What I disliked about it, to be honest, is that many parts of the plot were pretty stale... leftovers from season 1. For example, (maybe a spoiler?) the brute strength of Kirito is hardly toned down at all in the third arc.\r\nPRO: However, I did love the new story with Sinon. I really did. Nospoilers, though.\\n\r\nCON: Also, the fighting scenes... ughh... well, this is probably only a personal opinion, but in general, I find fighting scenes to be drawn and and boring most of the time, and SAO did little to make them more interesting for the most part. I could tell they tried, but... not hard enough. They were still boring.\\n\r\nPRO: The fourth arc, however, was really refreshing. The series went in a direction which I never expected it to, and I admire it for that. \\n\r\nCON: But what I still didn't like about it was how they had to push it all at us in the last couple of episodes. They also tried a little too hard to make the last episode a tear-jerker, but my feels weren't having it. As always, when it comes to pacing, SAO gets it all wrong. \\n\r\nPRO: But it was nice to see Kirito get his ass whopped for once. \\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThere isn't really much to say about the art. I'm giving it a 10/10 because I think it's fair to say that it's up to par with some of the best out there.\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nHonestly, I think that they could have gotten some better songs. Almost every song throughout the series that I can recall was soundtrack from a fighting seen, and more dramatic music could have been used at times. (Although the fourth arc probably had some, I just wasn't paying much attention.)\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nI'm giving the character 8/10 because SAO did a good job of covering the backstories of nearly every essential character, but as far as screen time goes, the amount of time Yuuka got as unexceptable. She deserved way more than the 4 or 5 episodes she got, considering a couple were still in the \"who is this mysterious girl?\" phase.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nDespite how critical I sound, I did really enjoy this anime. It wasn't boring by any means, in fact it was enjoyable, and was easy to get through. The plot devices that were used successfully were enough to keep me coming back for more.\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nIN CONCLUSION, SAO II is not as bad as I think people are making it sound. It's earned a lot of praise in general, and for that reason, people are becoming hypercritical to point out it's flaws and are generally disappointed when it doesn't reach a standard of near-perfection. However, if you have the time for it, SAO II isn't a bad series to pick up and watch.\\n",

            "content": "SWORD ON MY BUTT ART ONLINE REVIEW:\r\nMINDSET:\r\nIt maybe slightly better than the first, but it does get super annoying on how millions of people make discussions about it now \u201ceveryone\u201d is just talking at how horrible it was is just getting on my nerves, at the end of the day, all what You really want is just Kirito simply kicking the hell out of everyone, not some cheesy and over-reacting Michael Bay slash Urobutcher I'm now going to cry like sh*ty cheese drama... It could've been fine if it was JoJo Crusader clone...  ANYWAYS.... \r\nSYNOPSIS:\r\nKirito is now sent to play another game again! Yay!This time its an FPS. (now its obious that there milking the show) In Gun Gale Online its just like every other VMMO RPG but everything You fight is in FPS mode. Why? Its because some rich business guy asked him to kill a mysterious player called death gun, a mysterious player who uses a weapon called the \u201cDeath Gun\u201d a weapon in which if a player got shot by it, they die in real life. Why on Earth are these people hiring teens to do there dirty work? Cuz it sells.\\n\\n\r\nREVIEW:\\n\r\nBefore I try to get all meticulous with detail, yes, I loved the original cast especially Kirito as a character because I was a casual back then. I was purely sucked in nostalgia seeing him once again just sword flinging he's way aganist hoards of zero dimensional bad guys and the whole Harem aspect. \\n\r\n(take that for a grain of salt)\\n\\n\r\nEveryone is just so serious, like how Shione is surrounded by a bunch of guys doing some PK'ing and when the heavy comes, everyone just all flip the hell out as if this was real life near-death situation! The characters tend to react in this unorganic state of form and completely feels like the writer just pulled he's own pants, this overall makes the Drama corny as all hell, and moments when we are supposed to care about whatever on Earth is on screen, just looses it.\\n\\n\r\nKirito as the protagonist seems to be one who tends to drop all tension and drama since You know he's going to plot armoured, You know he's going to kill the bad guys, You know he's going emo when in reality the writers were just pretentious and You definitely can predict which new girl will enter he's Harem club miles away! Since the point of Kiritos existence is to be the \u201cOP\u201d it could've been fine if the show had more self-awareness and made itself more like a Michael Bay transformers when all You wanted was to see cool land mechs on CGI LSD fighting to the death without a sense of art, and it could've been so easy and so much better if they just made mindless action.\\n\\n\r\nSo the show fails to be consistent, so what about the Shion? Well she's annoying, the show constantly pokes at her as some emo tsundare who seems to sob every time the writers decided to put some \u201cDRAMATIC\u201d scene in which it becomes pretentious as how she treats everything like its a life or death situation  making all the Drama corny as hell. Like how we view her back story as this robber shot her mum (OH HOW SAD) but the meat of how it was so bad was that every time she looked at a gun, it hallucinates her into the past event! But even if they do pull that sh*t right, it still does not help that she's pretty much plot armoured like Kirito.\\n\\n\r\nLogically, the company that noticed this issue about Death Gun would try to ban him, but there wasn\u2019t even a sign of moderators in the game, and there is still just as many players playing this game... So what? They can't man overseas or even pick up the phone?!\\n\\n\r\nIf there would ever been anything that was improved as comparison to the original, is that they removed some of the bad writing, as for the first time ever! It actually feels like a game, they clearly present You the world in the first few episodes and how the gun gale thing works like tournament, control schemes, actual guns etc. though it feels like the information can be quite vague like how they never explain class builds but they improved the overall \u201cThis is a Game\u201d tone it was trying to achieve but not the content.\\n\\n\r\nSide characters? What side characters? All what I remember was that forgettable harem, and how they trashed Asuna over the side view, and now the 98% of the original cast are just there to be filler scenes for the fantards to gasm, because those characters can still be milked cash until it runs dry.\\n\\n\r\nReally guys? Death Gun? What a horrible name for a villain that is meant to make fantards go crazy....\\n\\n\r\nThe show does a pretty bad job at trying to keep mysteries as it fails trying to stick to its own identity, because the good guys are OP and that teenagers are the most powerful things in the universe  Valvrave style. There is also a sense that the writers were clearly forcing plot twists out of nowhere to create SHOCK FACTOR to make audinece scream in the top of their lungs, as Death Gun ominously triumphs the hoards of players with \u201cDeath Gun\u201d Kirito, now in confronting him noticed that it was really just a random psycho path from earlier memory in the original SAO, as the show fails to even create such twists as the whole thing felt like this inorganic pull.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, You all what You want to see is just Kirito killing everyone so easily, or just see loads of action having plot devices that clearly feel like the show was just giving as action, not this faulty Drama and thriller BS. They also made Kiritos new sprite into a girl which the show could've been the same without it, and can remove some useless filler scenes.\\n\\n\r\nJudging the show in its own merit, the original source material seems to be around 12 episodes long, while this adaptation is going to run for about 24. What a great cash in guys! You might as well go pull out some cheap scape plot convenience saying that the real villains of the show are Aliens, and that they were manipulating him even when he was a baby!\\n\\n\r\nWell at least the show feels like a game for once...\\n\\n\r\nWell at least the Animation still looks pretty to look at, and the CGI is not as horrendous, or no where as bad as the mainstreams of the season, and even though they still blended the backgrounds with some CGI, I still stand that one of the best things from SAO was the CGI fight scenes like Aldnoah. The action scenes look cool, the charcter designs are a slob for the most part, and an actual light saber as unoriginal product placement like wtf guys? The Action scenes still look cool as all hell, and just seeing Kirito simply doing what seems to be an impossible win made it look so easy doesn\u2019t never seemed to grow old despite of the bad content. Sure the budget kind of felt lower, but its still great and consistent all through out.\\n\\n\r\nOST is still pretty damn good, though it does feel rather similar to the first, and it would be fine if they just reusing the first OST, but overall, the music has a variety of all the mainstream instruments and sounds like techno beats, guitars, pianos, violins etc. Though not massively impressive, and me being far from a music critic, it still shows genuine emotion from each piece. The OP was a downgrade for me, screw it, its just more generic j-pop that I'm getting bored of these days. The purple tentacles were also a hilarious touch too.\\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nIts just more fangasm for fans wanting more for SAO, for the rest seeing how popular it was to hate this show, its still some of that mainstream garbage we critics have to be constantly fed everyday. so come up of any method to over think Your argument casuals! It will never work...\\n\\n\r\n3/10 \u2013 Story shucks.\\n\r\n3.5/10 \u2013 But all I wanted was my Kirito to kill players! ;_;\\n\r\n7/10 \u2013 Eh, just as good as the original...\\n\r\n7/10 \u2013 Eh, it might as well be the same as the original OST...\\n\r\n4/10 \u2013 When the story tries to be serious, it feels like a drag.\\n\\n\r\nFINALE: 4/10 When all I wanted to see was Kirito just kicking the hell out of everyone, the show tries to be pretentious.\\n\\n\r\nPERSONAL SCORE:\\n\r\n5/10 \u2013 The second half of the show did feature the original cast in action, due to nostalgia, that was a good watch and it does repair the damages caused by the first.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online II\r\nEpisodes: 24\r\nSpecial Episode: 1 (14.5)\r\nFirst of all, if you've seen SAO then you will probably for sure watch this and yes, it's worth it. Well, I won't be going on about why you should watch it since it's pretty much evident. Let's get to the review\r\nIt's divided into 2 arcs; Gun Gale Online and Alfheim Online\r\nThe first arc is from episodes 1 to 14 and a summary of the arc in the special 14.5\r\nThe second arc is from 15 onward and is further divided into 2 episodes; Calibur and Mother Rosario.\r\nStory 9/10:\r\nIt's pretty much the same. A problem arises in GGO andKirito is called to that game in order to solve it. GGO is completely new to Kirito and he makes new friends and meets up with old enemies.\\n\r\nIn ALO, stuff passes much more quicker and there are no problems in this arc. So, it's basically just your average VRMMORPG quest completion arc. However, the feels part of the anime comes in this arc. So, there is not much \"fight-till-the-death\" thing in this arc rather it's a talking type arc and the feels run high in this one.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10:\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are amazing. My favorite is the ending of the first arc; Startear.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10:\\n\r\nThe graphics and animation is the same as it was in the prequel. With new characters being introduced and the avatars of the characters changed slightly. But the character design is really good. And the new characters have their own real world problems to take care of which also merges with their performance in the game. Anyway, you'll love the new characters a lot.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThat's a given. It was a hell of a ride. And by the end of the series, you'll be crying, that I can guarantee. Too many feels.\\n\\n\r\nThere are 2 ways in which SAO II differs from SAO\\n\r\n1. SAO is much darker than SAO II\\n\r\n2. SAO II has more feels than SAO\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was a really nice sequel to the epic prequel. Don't miss it.",

            "content": "This is, SAO II. Its ups and down, but there is always only one truth. \r\n\"Although as an avid Eroge reader it left me dissapointed.'\"\r\nTo discern this one truth I went to many great lengths, I rewrote this review, MAL deleted my previous one. (not seeing its greatness) Yet I did not falter, for I know Kami are with me.  SAO is one of a kind of a franchise. Only this anime can inspire such hate and such love at the same time.  I certainly belong to the 3rd camp, read on to find out the truth beyond the truth. \r\nAlthough as anavid eroge gamer it left me dissapointed. Things that I required to enjoy this were missing. Although the studio went to great lengths to negate the effect of a lack of hentai scenes. The frequency of the famous (and great) Sinon ass shots is so astoundingly great that it left my dick hard throughout the entire 24 episodes.  Yet it left me feeling that something was missing, something more. And for that I never managed to finish with my dick mashing by just watching this anime. Ass shots, shameless fanservice, almost sexual scenes and a huge amount of them at that, it teases, and teases yet leaves you unfulfilled at the end of an episode necessitating you to fire up some Eroge/porn/Hentai to finish off.... If there was a score of fappability on MAL I'd give it a 5/10 - Casual, Poorly Executed, Yet for avid fans of SAO certainly possible. \\n\\n\r\nWell in any case, the story of SAO is quite the different type of a complex bear. Watching SAO made me feel like I was watching a documentary on the History Channel(ehm yes History...)  the writing feels like it was written by a horny 30 year old male virgin. Yet what you feel is of no concern to the writer. The writing is well executed and well written for sure. SAO clearly states itself as a plot-driven anime and that necessiates good writing, thankfully our good o'l writer is a genius the likes of never seen before Reinhard Heydrich. \\n\\n\r\nOur main protagonist is Kirito, he is special. For he has the power unique to him. Throughout my anime watching career I never encountered a power of similar proportions and scale. SAO is similar to Steins' Gate in the way that everything is explained scientifically and in the way of the protagonist who is an intellectual scientist, in the case of SAO the protagonist is a nuclear physicist who most likely studied at MIT (and other CIA-driven top secret facilities all around the world to perfect his invention) well those facts were not explicitly stated. But here is where the writer shows his greatness - everything is implied in huge detail. If you read between the lines you realise that Kirito possess the power of the King - Just like Geass from Code Geass! This power, it has power over the magnetic forces of the universe, he can denuclearize electrons using his device which is implanted onto his dick.  Yes, his dick. It has a gravitational field capable of pulling  every female (and some MALES!) into its reach forcing them to orbit his humble dick (which even without the device scores a massive 30 inch length. That is the implied reason on why Kirito gets every single p***y in the land of SAO.  \\n\\n\r\nYet it is clear, Kirito isn't a gamer, he is a spy for the CIA investigating Japanese visual reality technology.  That is why he looks like a professional model kung-fu karate fighter from ancient Tibet 15th Dalai Lama. That is my fan theory. I have an IQ of over 250 so it must be correct.  In any case, it is clear, SAO is the new scientific/intellectual anime, pfft Steins; Gate idiotic stuff for under 50 IQ children of ages 5 and below. Pfft Code Geass, Lelouch is a fag compared to Kirito who could 360 no scope him using his sword.  Pfft SAO 1, Kirito from SAO II is a female so he can pull his male Kirito friend using his female dick, wait a minute male Kirito's dick would counteract Female Kirito dick creating a gravitational vortex and a universal implosion because you cant just have antimatter meet with matter and expect shit not to blow the hell up. Okay in any case Kirito is the best protagonist since the coming of Reinhard von Lohengramm(although it is undeniable Kirito could command his loyal army of females to destroy the von Lohengramm empire easily and then piss on Reinhard's grave while resurrecting Kircheis if he was here)  and Prophet Zoroaster (Kirito made a better religion than that casual zoroastrianism, Kirito and his dick is an item to be worshipped for eternity). \\n\\n\r\nIn any case, Sinon, is the new main female (at least until Kirito and the writer get bored of her in later episodes) She has quite a nice buttcrack.  Very enjoyable to watch, although sucks when she is talking and the camera ain't focused on her 'ASSets'.... In any case at first she resists Kirito's dick ability of gravitational manipulation (which doesn't disobey Newton's law, this is a science anime so I expected nothing less than brilliant explanations) although soon enough she gets too close to the source of gravity and gets pulled in as hard as Silica (the only character name aside from Kirito, Sinon and Assuna I remember oh and that Grail or Krail guy who is only there to be a male member of Kirito's Solar system)  welp, towards the end she becomes background character #10. Which kinda made me pissed off because her buttcrack wasn't as often on the screen. \\n\\n\r\nSo yes, after in-depth analysis and 10 rewatches of this masterpiece of a series I had been led to a final conclusion, this series is remarkable. The literary value of this and the influence on the modern world is outstanding, I'd even argue the writer of this masterpiece was more influencial in the shaping of this modern world than Karl Marx, Albert Einstein, Charles V, Nicholas II,  Oda Nobunaga or even Charlamagne! I am sure in 200 years the name of this author will be put in history books alongside such personas of history. (most likely right beside Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Pol Pot and Chairman Mao) \\n\\n\r\nIn any case, I grant this anime a 10 STAR RATING, for all its glory.\\n\r\nPerfect Characters\\n\r\nPerfect Story\\n\r\nThought provoking narrative.\\n\r\nEloquent animation.\\n\r\nDirecting the likes of never seen since the coming of Buddha.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 best anime of 2014 - without a doubt. This is undeniable.\\n\\n\r\nLove and Peace.\\n",

            "content": "I was hyped for this season mainly because of Sinon and the introduction of guns. I get why people hated this season. It's because of guns. Me personally, I love guns. Thats why I loved watching this season. Like before, I'm going to give independent ratings since there are different arcs. Here's my review\r\nGGO 1st arc 9/10\r\nStory: 1 year after the ALO incident, Seijiro, a guy from the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications \"VR Division\" asked Kazuto to dive in the GGO game and investigate an incident. Professional players who are shot by \"Death Gun\" in the game is also dying in real life.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: Same as SAO 1st Season. Beautiful and colorful\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack is way more superior than the 1st Season. It gave me more eargasms. The opening soundtrack however is ok. Better than ALO's soundtrack but not better than SAO's opening soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Sinon, my 2nd favourite character behind Lizbeth has been introduced. Her character development is very well done and explains a lot about her character, why she acts very seriously in the game, etc. Her past story is also very good. Her best friend was also introduced. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I loved this arc. I wouldn't mind them focusing a whole season based on GGO. Screw the swords, guns are way more superior than swords.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCaliber 2nd arc 6.8/10\\n\\n\r\nStory: Sugu showed Kirito a new article stating that the Excaliber has been found in the game but no one has yet to retrieve it. Kazuto formed a party of 7 (Kirito, Sugu, Asuna, Lizbeth, Silica, Klein, and Sinon) and set out in a quest to get the Excaliber sword.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Sets of NPC were introduced but no major character was introduced in this arc.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Soundtrack was the same but my god, that opening soundtrack. For whatever reason, I can't stop listening to it. Opening soundtrack is way better than ALO and GGO's opening soundtrack but not better than SAO's opening soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This arc ain't that long and this was just a filler. I enjoyed this arc nonetheless because of some funny moments. They should have made this arc in an OVA instead of filling up 3 episode slots of Season 2.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMother's Rosario 3rd arc 9/10\\n\r\nStory: After being dissapointed with the Caliber arc, I thought this was also going to be a dissapointment. I was wrong. This was a lot better. In fact, it was in par with GGO even though it had less action\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This arc focuses more on Asuna and some new characters were introduced. Yuuki, an \"undefeatable\" player with 67 straight wins and leader of the \"Sleeping Knights\" guild. She's nicknamed \"Zekken\" or \"Absolute Sword\". Even Kirito lost to her. There's also 5 \"Sleeping Knighs\" member introduced but I'm not going to list all of them since it's going to cost me time. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I absolutely enjoy this arc.  It was a very emotional arc and I'm not going to spoil what happened at the end of the arc. You have to see it for yourself. All I'm going to say is this is the 1st anime that made me shed a tear and I usually don't cry or even shed a tear when watching tv shows.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8.5/10\\n\r\nI wouldn't say this was better than the 1st season but definitely a lot better than the ALO arc. I just didn't like how they wasted 4 episode slots on the Caliber arc and the useless 14.5 episode. I also can't wait for the 3rd season which is most likely going to be the \"Alicization arc\".\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Introduction of guns\\n\r\n-Nice story\\n\r\n-Perfect plot twists\\n\r\n-Great Character development\\n\r\n-Perfectly executed last arc\\n\r\n-Funny moments\\n\\n\\n\r\nCons\\n\r\n-The rape scene\\n\r\n-Caliber arc\\n\r\n-Useless 14.5 filler episode.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Before I begin this review, i would like to add that i probably will not do a review of the first season as the opinion of it is kinda already out there. Also i am not a heavy light novel reader so i am not too sure of the ittty bitty details.With that out of the way, on with the review!\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nNot to insensitive but i liked the death gun arc better than the mother rosairo and the excaliber one. Despite being just a game, gun gale online just feels a like a darker and grittier world (just a little) compared to alfiem and aincrad.The pvp aspect of it makes it a lot more interesting making for a more focused and easier to follow story. There's a smaller number of characters which probably worked to show's benefit giving more development for some of it's characters which i will touch on later. The story in two of the arcs is pretty tragic but not clannad-level feels imo(a story for another time).   \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say but great production values that some of us feel can be used on a better show (ahem...log horizon). The stand out points are definitely the fights in the first arc.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe is ost is okish, not bad, not great. I  liked the first opening but i think that is subjective. Not as good as crossing fields unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI liked sinon quite a bit(probably just a fanboy lol). Her backstory is pretty  cool like the ones you would see in those psychological anime but not super dark. Kirito is the same as usual, his good guy personality is great  but he is still kinda hard to relate to especially on his ways in wooing girls( maybe i'm just jelly).  The rest of the season one cast is pretty one dimensional besides asuna who gets more screen time this season. Yuuki is pretty generic character if you ignore the fact that she has aids.\\n\r\nThe villains are the usual mysterious, stupid and demented. The other supporting cast are mostly  just a face\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n I think this season is a big improvement from the first, add in a few more well developed characters and maybe a better protagonist then we'll be good. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nsome of you might have preferred a higher score, some probably wondered why i ranked it so high compared to some the other shows i watched. It's a good show but it has really bad reputation. Hopefully anime can build upon what has been established here and we would get a really good show.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online II Review,\r\nI cannot deny that I am fond of the Sword Art Online (SAO) franchise, and that I am a particular fan of their ideas of the existence of VRMMO (Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer Online) games. But I will do my utmost best not to let bias lead me. \r\nThe first season of SAO was a pleasure to watch and in my opinion it had its charms. It can be noted however, there were more plot holes then actual plot. But then again, they had to cover two years and an arc in a limited amount of episodes. The writers probably didtheir best, but it just did not work out. But even though it had its flaws, it was a fun anime to watch. \\n\\n\r\nPlease note though that the anime is an adaption of the light novel, so a few things that happen in the light novel are not explained in the anime. For someone who has not read the light novel it would already generate a plot hole why Kirito started playing VRMMO\u2019s again. Asuna\u2019s mother quite right pointed out that she found it weird that a SAO survivor would even want to use the AmuSphere, an invention that resembles the NerveGear after being stuck in Aincrad. \\n\r\n(Side-track:) Reasoning it could be said that there would be two logical first reactions after \u2018waking up\u2019. The first would be the one Asuna\u2019s mother points out; You do not want to play VRMMO again and you would rather (exaggerating extremely) die than use it again. The other reaction would be that you have grown so fond of the world you were in (you have lived there for two years after all\u2026) that you would rather live in a VRMMO than in the real world.\\n\\n\r\nBut back to season two, the plot exists out of three arcs; the Gun Gale Online (GGO), the Caliber and the Mother Rosario arcs. It can be noted that the creators made the same \u2018mistake\u2019 by having an anime that was split. In SAO there was the Aincrad arc, followed by the ALfheim Online (ALO) arc. In SOA II you have three arcs. It weakens the plot of the anime as a whole, if not executed right. The transition between the GGO arc and the Caliber arc was quite horrible, the viewer was thrown form one game to another. The transition of Caliber and Mother Rosario was already better, but that is only because they share the same game, and thus the same setting, namely ALO.\\n\\n\r\nNot mentioning the bad transitions between arcs, the plot is inconsistent at times. The one I found most striking was the promise of Kirito to Sinon. He promises Sinon that he would always think about her when he uses the sword Excalibur. However when Kirito equips the sword and starts to yield it there is absolutely no reference to the promise. Not even a simple thought. The plot of also GGO lacks distinctive battles and realistically ones. If you are an agility based character and have some fine reflexes I can understand that you are able to deflect and arrow, that could be realistic. But deflecting bullets from a gun that is just a few meters away? Highly unlikely.\\n\\n\r\nThe main themes of SAO were the exploring of a fictional world. The world of GGO seems quite interesting with its desolate area\u2019s and unique nature, but the world was hardly explored, like in SAO. There are monster raids for EXP and money, but no monster actually appeared in the anime. The setting of this arc is merely the Bullets of Bullets tournament, divided into a qualification tournament and the real tournament. The battles that were fought in the qualification tournament were far from exciting, lasting mere seconds. The battles in the real tournament were better, but even the finale was far from worthy. The plot continues with Caliber, a horrible transition. \\n\\n\r\nThe Caliber is a short side story that is very weak. Stretching only three episodes, it felt rushed. A master quest has to be done and, surprise, Kirito & Co had to save the world. The major character development was done in the GGO arc and was left behind in this arc. Especially Sinon\u2019s development was left out. The atmosphere was also juxtaposed, from having to \u2018finish business with the villain\u2019 to \u2018exploring dungeons\u2019. Caliber can only be seen as a filler arc hardly worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nThe final arc, Mother Rosaria, had an emotionally strong plot. \u2018Right in the feels\u2019 as a 9gagger would say. It is very character-orientated, with Asuna joining the Sleeping Knights guild to help them defeat the floor boss. Later it is revealed why the Sleeping Knights are so keen on defeating the floor boss. The Mother Rosaria arc also zooms in on Asuna\u2019s personal situation and her struggle with her mother. Today\u2019s teenagers can easily relate with Asuna since having internet friends is a taboo. Put bluntly at least. The battles were better animated and also realistic \u2013 as far that is possible in a fantasy world.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest points critics made was that SAO had little to no character development. In SAO II, there is a lot more character development, especially towards Asuna in the Mother Rosaria arc. The GGO arc is also character-orientated, but less in comparison to the last arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe GGO arc had character development, however it was not strong. The dialogue the two had, where it would go in-depth, Sinon was in suggestive positions and the camera angles were, kind of, \u2018well aimed at the female curves\u2019. In the other dialoge they had it was circular. \\n\r\nKirito and Sinon both share guilt for murdering. I had more empathy for Sinon, because when Kirito killed the men it was a matter of having to kill, a \u2018them or I\u2019 scenario. In Sinons case however, she did not have to interfere with the robbery. While both share the feeling of guilt, in the Caliber arc, however this feeling has evaporated and Sinon becomes a flat character that instantly fits in the \u2018crew\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nThe Calibar arc is not worth mentioning here and the Mother Rosaria arc did what the writer should have done in the GGO arc. Asuna gets a good background story, where the viewer can finally relate with her struggle. Her mother hates that Asuna still plays VRMMO and considers it only as a waste of time, while for Asuna the virtual world has become her \u2018real\u2019 world.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork has improved, in comparison with the first season. The battle scenes were well executed, but because of the lack in number, a full potential was never reached. So the quality of the artwork does not shine, like it deserved to. The GGO arc was juxtaposed to the ALO arc in artwork. The GGO arc had mostly a dark, grey and metallic colours, while the ALO arcs had bright colours which really stood out. But it was well done nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound and music were not better nor worse than season one. The voice acting did not stand out, no sentences worth remembering. It should be noted however, that there was no voice \u2018out of place\u2019 or a voice that caused a distraction.\\n\r\nThe OST does what it was composed for, delivering the extra edge to each scene. The OST in season one were in place and so were they in season two. Solid, but not extraordinary. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I did enjoy watching the show. But again the first episode of the anime has a fan service scene which returns more often in the anime. Namely an extreme fixation of the female curves of Sinon. Not that I mind the shots, but it adds little to nothing to the anime, not even comical relief. It is not the best anime, not the worst. It falls, just like its predecessor, in the middle. One should note that the Mother Rosaria arc did what no SAO arc has done before, the good development of characters. Yes the anime had its flaws, but for the casual watcher, it could be an enjoyable anime. For the hard critics however, not so. \\n",

            "content": "I was not a big fun of the first SAO season. But it was good enough to make me watch the next season. So what can I say about it? Was SAO 2 true to the ''hype'' that all the fanboys were expecting? In my opinion it managed to be better from the first season in some parts while in some other it was exactly the same (and maybe worst? We'll  see.)\r\nLet's start with the story. It's divided into three arcs. Gungale online (GGO), Excalibur arc and Mother Rosario. The first arc was also the most interesting in my opinion not only from theother two story arcs of this season but from all the other arcs of the previous seasoncs also. It was really enjoyable and I would really pleased if the anime stopped right after when this arc ended . But of course if A1 Pictures made an SAO season with only 14 episodes it would have been burned down by the fanboys. Also another part that bugged me off a lot was the kinda rushed and unsatisfying ending of this arc. But with only this exception I can say that I enjoyed GGO very much.  The second arc was really small (only three episodes) and boring, it didn't actually had any meaning. And the third arc, well the third arc was trying to hit the viewers  right in the feels. It wasn't as boring as the Excalibur arc because it was trying to build up more Asuna's character and it closes with a bitter-sweet ending but still I personally have seen too many sad anime to be moved by an SAO arc. The problem that this season had though in comparison with the previews one was the fact that the drama scenes was really ridiculous. Exactly because now no one would die for real if he was killed off in the game the characters shouldn't have any worries at all. But still I don't know why but we see some characters taking this game like it's a matter of life and death.One strong example is at precisely episode 2 we see an adult loosing his temper and going nuts because he was loosing a fight!!! It seemed like the writers tried to put some of the at least excusable drama that the first season had into this one without making it though.\\n\\n\r\nLet's move to the  sound section. I literally hated the first opening and because I am a masochist I listened to it many times with the hope that it would at  least grow into me but I ended up hating even more. But the second opening was good  at it made up for it's horrible predecessor. The voice acting was really good and I have to give credit especially to Asuna's voice actor for her really good performance especially in the third part. The endings were really uninteresting for me but they weren't bad.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now let's move to the character section. It seemed like the writers understood that the first season had the words character development completely out of it's dictionary and they decided to put at least in some of it in the first arc. And yeah they tried to manage the impossible. Make the completely overpowered Kirito show weakness. That happened too the first arc where he discovers that an enemy from the original SAO came into GGO to kill him. This would be interesting but it  didn't manage to do anything in the end because Kirito remained the overpowered protagonist who gets ''unintentionally'' (?) all the girls at the end. so yeah the kinda well built character development that appears initially eventually dissapears bringing back the Kirito that everybody knew and loved (except from me it seems). BUT to be fair the new characters that appeared in this season were really interesting. Especially Sinnon was an interesting character with an interesting back story and Deathgun... well you can't hate this guy even though the anime ruined him in the end. The other thing I want to point out was the good character development that Asuna had  in the mother Rosario arc. Yes this arc is completely about Asuna and  how she deals with her problems not only in the virtual but also in the real world, because of the (overall uninteresting) character of Yuki a character that appeared in this arc.\\n\\n\r\nAnd closing I have too say this for the SAO season 2. It was certainly more enjoyable than the first season because it was more character driven. It would be better if the last two arcs didn't exist at all but I know I can't ask for anything. I will give it a 7 because it understand it's mistakes and didn't try to repeat them on it's predecessor's scale. Should you watch it?  Well if you liked SAO then you will probably like this it proved that it can make some good stories if it wants it badly. Of course this is only my opinion. Feedback and also your opinions will be gladly accepted. Thanks for reading.\\n",

            "content": "Note: I tried to leave the text with the smallest possible revelations of the work, but it was not possible to leave it totally insect to maintain a good understanding and good justifications. The revelations presented are small and should not greatly jeopardize those who have not yet witnessed, but are warned to have revelations. \r\nOn the whole this anime is worth ten of ten, now if it is divided by the arches changes a bit. The first arc goes from the first episode to the \r\nfourteenth, the second arc goes from the fifteenth to the seventeenth episodes, and the third arc goes from theeighteenth to the twenty-fourth. His first arc is eight or nine, the second arc is five or six, and the third arc is ten x ten x ten, a thousand.\\n\\n\r\nAs there are already many revisions of this anime, it will be different, the focus is on the final arc of Sword Art Online II. Even because it is the best arc and only for him it is worth seeing all the others, even if the others were rubbish, which they are not.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat should be most valued in a plot is its content, the more content a work has, the more points it must earn, as well as the ways in which such knowledge is transmitted, whether in dialogues, in images, whether implicitly or explicitly. In Sword Art Online II in this last arc that is one of the smallest of the anime are brought a lot of very rich themes, but we will only speak of some, although all were transmitted in depth, with moral reflections, with philosophical approaches, and without contradictions.\\n\\n\r\nThe first issue we observe and the most compelling, as well as of much relevance and teaching for our real world, is the issue of diseases and treatment, focusing on those diseases that restrict mobility, terminal and incurable. Being present in all the individuals of the Yuuki group, mainly in the same person with a very violent acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\\n\\n\r\nThe second theme is the conflictive relationship between generations, passed through the conflict between Asuna and his mother. All the problems arising between the incomprehension of a new reality and the way of living that technology brings, as well as the conflicts with established patterns and values \u200b\u200bare shown.\\n\\n\r\nThe third theme dealt with during Yuuki's death is a very old but always very debated and relevant philosophical theme that is the life's feeling. Sword Art Online II shows an unusual way, and at least for many until that unknown moment of facing this dilemma, giving life feeling for the gratifying moment, even though throughout its existence has been enormous and despairing suffering.\\n\\n\r\nThe fourth theme, the use of technology to produce diverse worlds and realities. This is so much produced by the cameras that Asuna takes, thus bringing to Yuuki a new world of contacts and integration with the real world of her, nourishing feeling of happiness and socialization. This is also portrayed by the possibility that sick people can make the virtual world their reality.\\n\\n\r\nThe fifth theme is the very questioning of what is real. And if the virtual world is not real, that is the reality and even more real for some.\\n\\n\r\nThe sixth theme is with regard to the possibility of artificial intelligence interacting with humans also not be considered alive. Even the anime treats Yui as a family person, a daughter of the protagonist couple, and here in this arc the theme takes even more depth through the interaction of the character with the real world of anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe seventh theme is related to the treatment of a character in terminal state, who even disillusioned managed to achieve the cure. Therefore, by dealing with this possibility he justifies the expenses and the treatment for people in that state, and give hope.\\n\\n\r\nThe eighth theme is the quest to leave a mark, do something memorable, do something not to be forgotten, leave your legacy, (a way to stay alive after death). This desire is not only addressed, but the importance is demonstrated from the point of view of those who know that it does not have much time, hence it is shown how to reach this goal and determination is necessary even in this situation.\\n\\n\r\nThe ninth theme is death and solitude. No one better than Yuuki to show this, that suffering from an incurable patient, alone of relatives, because his whole family had died of this disease, still clung to the life, and the love for the friendly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nHardly even those who hate him have the audacity to speak ill of his art, so speaking of image in Sword Art Online II is kind of unnecessary, wasted time and meaningless.\\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online II has simply one of the best character designers, with a range of them all detailed and consistent. The art of scenery is a visual spectacle of colors, lights and innovation. Already the fluency of the anime is of excellent quality, with some iconic scenes, remarkable, reference of ability.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing Sword Art Online II agrees is that it's almost unquestionable is in action, and very partly because of the quality of the animation. All moments of action scenes are done with plenty of fluidity, beautiful graphics, and choreographies to leave the jaw dropped. And that all set in a good pace, good track and the most timely moments in history. As if it were not enough the last arc has the best action scenes of the whole series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nAnother very strong point of Sword Art Online II is its soundtrack, not only maintained the same level of the first, but kept the same style, and even improved. Again hardly anyone dares to speak ill of it, even those who hate Sword Art Online II. No matter if there is someone who is not dazzled by the Luminous Sword is a rare case that deserves to be studied.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nThis is a polemic point, but much is the fruit of misunderstanding and defamation. Therefore it is necessary to say before anything that there are several types of characters, they have the protagonists, the coadjuvantes, those who make small support points, and the extras. So you can not treat and demand the same things from all the characters so that whatever the story has a narrative minimally decent and focused.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonists have their stories and family bonds revealed, they evolve, are shown interactions between them, motivation of actions are reported, past emotional attachment is strong. What else can one ask for and expect from a good character? All characters that have narrative focus in the amime have layers, and are well crafted. Their motivations are presented, their anxieties and yearnings are demonstrated.\\n\\n\r\nBut did not the author work with such a character? Kirito himself in a sensational storyline bid went on to support this last arc. It is necessary to understand the narrative focus and stop wanting to treat co-stars as if it were protagonist all the time. Finally, all the new characters who play a secondary role, members of Yuki's team are extremely charismatic.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online II is extremely exciting, something very difficult, sought after in movies and even more difficult in anime. They could have kept all the good qualities already mentioned and miss to know how to pass the emotion, because producing emotion is not only the question of content, music, or image, it is putting everything in the right context and context, and Sword Art Online does this splendidly well.\\n\\n\r\nIt's likely to start crying to leave the memorial scene, but it's hard to even cry someone with Yuuki's death. But the best thing is that unlike other animes that only make people cry, the one in the end brings a good feeling, a feeling of gratitude and hope, which harmonizes the emotions with the very message of the plot.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe narrative, the way the story is told, rhythm and dialogues. The dialogues are not low, they are not confusing, they are not very expository, they are not conflicting, they are not full of holes, they are not too cults, nor are they too simple, at this point everything is very well done. The rhythm of the anime is a good rhythm, where the pauses of action are properly dosed and the entrance of the drama is very well placed.\\n\\n\r\nIn all the arcs of this anime have suspense questions, and in that the question is around the mysteries of Yuuki and his group which is done with great care, since it causes people to think, launches clues, but does not deliver until the right moment. I only regret that this last arc is too short to make the mystery even more instigating.\\n\\n\r\nI finish saying that when I watched I had to literally stand and clap and I just stopped crying to give that smile of having seen something very rewarding. So nothing more just and deserved than this note. During that arc I cried as much as I had ever watched anything.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhy then is Sword Art Online frowned upon and does not have a splendid note on EVIL? \\n\\n\r\n1. What happens is that this anime is a victim of macho and stupid prejudice because of the arc of the fairies of the first season, attitudes usually coming from male adolescents, but dominate the EVIL. Soon for this anime is labeled many people do not even want to open to evaluate or enjoy the second season honestly.\\n\\n\r\n2. On account of a defamation campaign promoted by hateful people, through websites of animes, influential youtubers, and by word of mouth. It seems to have become a kind of hobby, a fad speaking badly of this anime, and if a person speaks well it will fall on the weight of being against common sense, soon it will be censored.\\n\\n\r\n3. On account of alienation, since the defamation only has a greater effect through alienation. I see people copying the opinions of each other a lot without making critical evaluations. So often they have works sows that are well-quoted and have masterpieces that are barely seen. People in general are very easily shaped and influenced, including the so-called opinion makers, many times they are just copying one another. That's a pity, it's a disgrace, but it's the truth. Because Sicrano or so-and-so said the note goes up, or the note goes down if he says it's bad.",

            "content": "TLDR: Tried too hard to be good\r\nStory wise, SAO II improved upon SAO. There were three arcs in SAO II. GGO, Calibur, and Mother Rosario. GGO was my favorite out of these, being an unexpected change of pace from the fantasy setting. Introducing a fun, new world to explore was great; the only let down was a poor execution for the ending. 7.5/10 for GGO. The second arc was really shitty. We were set back into the usual world, but with new scenery. It felt just plain bad when compared to GGO and even the past seaason's poor arcs. 3/10. Mother Rosario was all thehype. Everyone that had read the light novels had said that it will be the saving grace of SAO. Turns out, it was just a bunch of sentimentality and a bad excuse at trying to be \"deep\". 7/10.  Overall, SAO II's story was still more than mediocre, I'd even admit it was good. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality was improved; SAO has it's own edgy style that's nice for action sequences, but not so nice for stills and day-to-day life. The characters look decent, and the land's look quite good; however, SAO II has no amazing quality that you'd expect from newer anime. It still sticks to what it has going for it, and strongly at that. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound quality was quite good. Not much stood out to me except the intro songs that were pretty catchy; nevertheless, each scene had a fitting soundtrack that set the appropriate atmosphere.  8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the first arc that were introduced were Sinon, Death Gun, and his brother, whatever his name was (ASADA-SAN!ASADA-SAN!ASADA-SAN!ASADA-SAN!ASADA-SAN!, that guy). Sinon had plenty of development and backstory. She was a good character and became best girl (after Asune became too dere, not enough tsun). Death gun was an awesome villain, because we knew almost nothing about him and he had an otherworldy power of sorts that nobody else possessed. ASADA-SAN!ASADA-SAN! wasn't so good, really shitty at that. For Calibur, we got some shitty AI characters and that was all. For Mother Rosario, we got a realistic mother, and Konno Yuuki. Her friends don't matter, but Zekkan was an important character. However, the sentimentality there was obviously forced. Without spoilers, I didn't feel anything for her situation, and didn't like her as a character. The entire series (both seasons) our MC is the best. That's what made him Kirito. We've all accepted this a a truth, but all of a sudden this bitch walks in and one-ups MC. Asuna (his faithful lover) responds by taking Kirito's role as MC and ditching him and making him her bitch. All Kirito had to do was stand up and defend his pride as best character in the game, but no. Zekkan comes in and fucks everything up. 7/10 for characters. (also Asuna's mother was in the right, Asuna's a little bitch that can't accept reality. But really, I thought her mother was a good character)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- well I did enjoy this, but not as much as I initially enjoyed SAO I. GGO would be a 8/10 for me, Calibur a 2/10, MR a 5/10 (would be a six if Kirito stood up and smacked a bitch in that last episode). so 6/10 for enjoyment. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd rate this 7/10, as it's action packed and full of extremes (both good and bad). It is more entertaining than many other seven/ten's; nevertheless, it is heavily flawed, but enjoyable. The ending was ok, and I will be watching a third installment (because you know this shits gonna get one, with the stupid amount of popularity it gets). \\n\\n",

            "content": "SAO II is a worth sequel to SAO. Not as good, but a worthy sequel. I'll try to give some objective views on why I think it deserves a high score, but also why I don't think it deserves a top score. Heads up though, if you didn't like SAO, you won't like SAO II. \r\nStory: 8/10, Characters: 8/10. Both arcs features a new main character, and both of these perform excellently. They have some major character development, and they often get most screen time. However, this does neglect the development of Kirito and Asuna. \r\nThe plot in itself is generally great, but it suffersfrom some pace-issues in the later half of arc 1. They simply used flashbacks too much. However, both arcs are ultimately good, and I especially enjoyed the endings. They focus on a lot of issues in the real world, like trauma, and they've made some great stories out of it. Gungale was a nice step in another direction, so we got some variation on the environments and the action (guns!). It was also great to see more use of the side-characters in Exalibur. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10, Sound: 8.5/10. The art is really beautiful, and it's cool that they have one arc in a science-fiction world, and one in a fantasy world. This gives them to opportunity to show off different environments, which they do. Characters are colorful and vibrant. The OPs and the EDs are excellent, but the OST is not as memorable as the original SAO, and it reuses some of the themes. However, they've made some great tracks for Gungale.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.5/10, Overall: 9/10. If you didn't enjoy SAO, you won't enjoy SAO II, since it's not as good. If you did like SAO, watch it. Note, this anime tips between 8 and 9 for me, but I enjoyed it so much I gave it a 9.",

            "content": "This is gonna be my first review of like anything ever, so plz no judge if it happens to get a little bit...POOPY...*badum tss\r\nWhen I first hopped onto the SAO train after the first season had already aired completely, I was hooked. The idea that you could jump into virtual reality and play an mmorpg (I happen to be part of the mmorpg hype) was astounding to me, and that both realities could blend in such a horrifying manner where dying in one meant dying for real drew me into the story even more. Looking at the overall ratings for both the original and itssequel, I can understand why SAO I was much higher, and even then it's not too much of a surprise given the overall trend that sequels of anything tend to get a bad rap.\\n\\n\r\nWell without further ado, here are my thoughts. The first arc of the season was O.K. Not O.K. as in seal-of-approval-worthy, but O.K. as in...average. Although the concept was different in some respects, overall, it was just the same concept with a different costume on. The same theme of virtual reality in an mmorpg was continued (I can't say I didn't ENJOY that decision though) but, combined with the reuse of the concept that death can occur while playing a game in virtual reality, the story simply got a little stale.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc is where I see most of the problem with this anime. Honestly, ending it right there in the middle of the season before the filler summary \"half-episode\" might even have been better. Long story short, it lost direction. I was confused after the first episode of the new arc aired, and proceeded to get more and more confused as more episodes came out as nothing more than what seemed like filler. (*SMALL SPOILER HERE*) Like cool, he gets a new sword. Big deal. Now what?\\n\\n\r\nMy \"now what?\" was never answered. The story finally decided to go in at least some direction after a few episodes, but the sudden shift (again) confused me even more and left me thinking that it might just be another short filler coming up. This new part did go to the end of the series though, which I guess would have been better than if the whole thing was just a series of mini-arcs with no overall direction whatsoever. And so, the story gets a 5 from me. This is the main issue which you all should consider before continuing your SAO journey, and even if you do decide to, consider ending it halfway through or skipping the fluffy filler at the beginning of the second arc, unless you're as dedicated as me. Now for the other stuff.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art astounded me as it did in the first one, with characters and costumes and scenery and animations as fluent and beautiful as ever. Solid 9 here, not a 10 because there really wasn't anything TOO special or unique.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, again nothing too special, although the OP and ED songs were catchy and fit the theme well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I think an integral part of the SAO series lies within its characters. The character development is not so fabulous as to bring me to tears, but it works and it works well, and I do like how the characters were brought back and were consistent, unlike certain other animes with some undue personality changes. HOWEVER, I do not like how certain characters are basically completely left out in both arcs of the series--Asuna and the others in the GGO arc, and the new character Shinon in the second arc. A very weak attempt to keep Shinon in in the second arc was made, which made it even worse as her character basically completely vanished and she had like one line in the last episode. HOWEVER HOWEVER, I absolutely loved the character of Yuuki, a new character who is the center of the season's second arc (disregarding the first couple of fillers). Hope and friendship amidst inevitable tragedy and despair really touched me in many different ways. If there's any reason to watch the second arc it's to watch it for Yuuki.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed GGO and would probably rate my enjoyment of that arc an 8 or a 9, but I didn't exactly enjoy the second arc for the reasons mentioned about the story. Overall, a 7.\\n\\n\r\nI think that quantitatively I may have even been a little generous in some respects, and I feel as if character can be love-it-or-you-don't and can be argued both ways. But overall, I would recommend anyone who watched SAO and loved the series and the overall theme and concept to continue on the journey and perhaps consider not going past the first arc.

It better the evil Mother crap We getting.\\n\r\nOf course the show then\\n\r\nDecided to take a turn for the \\n\r\nWorse. So after they finish the boss.\\n\r\nAnd the group sadly brakes up.\\n\r\nWe find out that the leader of the \\n\r\nGroup Has AIDS and is close to\\n\r\nDeath and that the rest of her group \\n\r\nAre also in the similar boat.\\n\\n\r\nSo basically this entire arc is this show \\n\r\nPoor excuse to try and milk emotions \\n\r\nOut of you.\\n\r\nNow I know that some found this pretty \\n\r\nSad and heart braking.\\n\r\nBut I personally couldn't find a reason to care \\n\r\nAbout any of these characters.\\n\r\nAnd before you people in the comments say oh your so \\n\r\nHeartless biogundam why don't you care.\\n\r\nwell let me just say that for one \\n\r\nHave been in a similar situation \\n\r\nThat these characters have been in.\\n\r\nAnd if they presented it properly then\\n\r\nMaybe I could have cared a little \\n\r\nAbout what was happening.\\n\r\nBut what really bothers me about how \\n\r\nThey did it. Is that is seems like that this was just  Added in because they couldn't think up any more interesting storylines \\n\r\nAt the time and so they just wrote it up this mallow\\n\r\nDramatic bullshit \\n\r\nAnd hoped that most people would bye into it. \\n\r\nSo after the AIDS girl dies things go back to normal\\n\r\nAnd that Asuna mother is now fine with her \\n\r\nDating kirito.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, 4/10\\n\\n\r\nSo the mian character kirito \\n\r\nIs pretty generic \\n\r\nhe is basically Jesus-kun.\\n\r\nBut one thing which they tried \\n\r\nWith his character which was kind of interesting\\n\\n\r\nWas for him to Get PTSD \\n\r\nwhich he should have got last season.\\n\r\nBut never mind he got in now.\\n\r\nAnd what do they do with it.\\n\r\nNothing \\n\r\nbasically what happened is that he gets over his PTSD in about one episode.\\n\r\nAnd then he back to kicking ass again.\\n\r\nWait what shouldn't it take more than one episode to\\n\r\nGet over PTSD. Well I am sorry but this is sword art online \\n\r\nWhere one thing is bought up to be ended by the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are pretty basic.\\n\r\nYet again. \\n\r\nWith the old cast coming back \\n\r\nAnd the only ones who seems to stand out was\\n\\n\r\nThe new characters\\n\r\nSimon and the ADIS girl.\\n\\n\r\nThat where I wouldn't say better but I would say \\n\r\nMore interesting.\\n\r\nAnd they could have been even more interesting \\n\r\nIf they where presented properly.\\n\r\nAnd the quote on quote bad guy death gun was probably The most dispontment I have felt in my life when it comes to anime. Because they build him up as some sort  of bad ass and then it turns out he is a rapist. \\n\\n\r\nArt, 7/10\\n\r\nAnimation looks pretty nice.\\n\r\nThe animation has a lot of polish it.\\n\r\nNow there are a few inconsistencies \\n\r\nHere and there.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere also some very good use of color scheme.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is generic it's pretty much standard light novel fare.\\n\r\nThe character designs are also pretty generic.\\n\r\nI think that only thing that stood out was probably the \\n\r\nDesigns because it was like a mix of post apocalyptic mixed with Japanese RPGs \\n\\n\r\nSound, 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe first op song and ending song where quite good and nice to \\n\r\nListen to at least for me.\\n\r\nI thought the second op and ending wasn't as good as the first op and ending \\n\r\nIt just that the second op and ending didn't really click with me personally.\\n\r\nBut I do think it worth a listen.\\n\r\nThe ost was quite nice as well to listen to as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSo what I enjoyed about this show is pretty much what I liked about it in season one \\n\r\nSo basically I enjoy the fight scenes even though it would have been nice to see more gun action instead of kirito using a lightsaber, but in retrospect it was pretty cool to watch \\n\r\nHim flip around and do cool shit.\\n\r\nI also enjoyed the ost. \\n\r\nSo pretty much What I enjoyed about this show are all for superficial reasons.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 4/10 \\n\\n\r\nSo if your looking for an anime and you just want entertainment them sword art online is for you. It is nothing more nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nBut if your looking for more than just entertainment then probably look for something else then.\\n",

Okay, so in the first series a group of people were forced to stay within the world of an online game with death waiting for them if they died in the game or someone took their head sets off. This was all  accomplished using microwaves. Because in the world of SAO consumer safety is just not a concern and microwave radiation works differently. It's really stupid that way. Moving on, our boringmain cast made it out and our hero interacted with his sister, who was completely in love with him because the writer wanted a love triangle and learned how to write those from Love Hina Again. Our hero then went to a different online game where his generic love interest had gone from an action girl to a damsel in distress who was constantly threatened with rape. With some help, she was rescued and able to leave the game world. Supposedly, this is the good series but after the first one, I really doubt it could be. I mean, maybe if they actually give their characters some distinctive personalities beyond the generic, they eliminate the incestuous bollocks, and they figure out how to write a compelling narrative, it could transform into something decent. Let's see if that happens.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nOur adventure begins with our protagonist, Blandon being summoned by the generic authority figure. In an MMO called Gun Gale Online, a player who calls himself Death Gun pointed his weapon at a couple of different players and fired. Afterwards, the players were found dead of heart failure. Has this Death Gun found a way to actually kill people using the newer, safer virtual reality technology? Blandon is almost certain its impossible but he agrees to investigate, just in case and the best way to do that is convert his current account into a GGO account and take part in the stupidly named Bullet of Bullets tournament.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the significant problems with the series. First of all, there will be some minor spoilers here. Just letting you know. Now, let's talk about the whole GGO thing. During this arc we discover that the player killers from the first series, you know, the ones who banded together to actually murder people during a crisis situation which makes no sense based on actual ways that humans behave. Those guys. Not only were these actual murderers released from the game with no charges brought against them but the authorities didn't even keep track of who they were. Yes, that's right. Not only were these actual murderers released from the game with no charges brought against them but the authorities didn't even keep track of who they were. I have to repeat that because it's almost inconceivably stupid. How did this series take one of the dumbest plot points from the first series and make it even dumber? How is the future, as represented by Sword Art Online, this stupid? Seriously, if the authorities of this world are this utterly inept and huge numbers of people are just waiting for the opportunity to be sociopathic, how has the human species not Darwinised itself in this world? But lets move on because the more I think about that plot point, the more its idiocy hurts. Not only were these actual murderers released from the game with no charges brought against them but the authorities didn't even keep track of who they were. Another issue is that, during this arc, we learn that people can sit around in their online games and watch other people play different online games. People don't have regular PCs any more that they can use for that? You wouldn't even think that online games would support watching other online games just for basic business reasons of not wanting to do anything to showcase their competitors, but this is the world of SAO where rudimentary logic was lynched.\\n\\n\r\nNext, we have an arc about Blandon and his equally uncompelling friends just playing their fantasy game. It doesn't have anything as massively egregiously wrong with it as the whole GGO thing. Its biggest problem is just that it's really damn boring. We have no reason to care about any of these twits and all their accomplishments are in an online game. A general problem with the series as a whole is the \u201cromantic dialogue\u201d between Blandon and Blanda. It is horrendously bad. It's on the level of Revenge of the Sith.\\n\\n\r\nThe final arc is about Blanda, the generic action girl who spent the second arc of the first series as a damsel in distress, joining a small group in order to beat a boss in an online game. There are four major problems with this arc. I'll get to one of them when I talk about the characters. As for the other three, the first is that the game they're playing is really poorly designed when it comes right down to it. First off, every floor has a boss that can only be beaten once, ever. Which is going to create a problem with attracting new players. Not only that, but it's going to cause a lot of players to quit out of frustration. That's why real MMOs have quests that every player can complete once. Maybe more if they help someone else who activated it. You need that content to keep people invested. Not only that, but this game apparently has a feature where players can physically block access to these bosses from other players. Blanda and her compatriots have to fight through another group of players in order to just gain access to a boss area. First off, why isn't this against the TOU? In theory, you could have a group of high level trolls just do this for the lols and if it is against the TOU, why don't Blanda and her group just threaten to tell a moderator to make these guys move and preserve all their HP, MP and healing items for the boss? It's pretty clear that the group blocking their path thinks that they're too few in number to win. I don't think they'd risk moderation. Then we have the second little issue. Blanda and her friends, this supposedly great group of gamers, take a long time to figure out that the incredibly conspicuous glowing jewel on the boss's chest is a weak point. How do they take a fight and two-thirds of a second to figure that out? Glowing conspicuous weak points are kind of a staple of gaming. The final issue is just that this arc works so hard to be tragic and emotionally manipulative, but tragedy isn't something you get by using cheap \u201cthis is a sad situation that happens in reality\u201d scenarios. In reality, you have actual people who go through this. In a series like this, you have a flat caricature of a person. I've been more emotionally invested in Jelly Babies than I was in this \u201ctragic\u201d little story.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the positives. I will say, to the first arc's credit, I do like Death Gun's secret. After the whole insanely stupid plot element, I fully anticipated it to be something as absurd as using microwaves to kill people. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it was actually a pretty good reveal. Even if nothing else about the arc's writing was.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nOn the positive side, the incestuous sister doesn't get much screen time and barely pines for her brother. So, that's a slight improvement. For new characters, we have Sinon. While she suffers from the most poorly written PTSD since Ms Marvel was terrified of touching men, she's also the closest the series gets to a developed character. Now, let's talk about the fourth problem from the final story arc. Blanda is really annoying in this series. We find out that she didn't mind living in the game where you could die for real because she doesn't get on with her family. Now, you might think her family must be really terrible for that to be the case, but they aren't. She's just a whiny trollop. We get to see her interact with her mum. About the worst you can say about the lady is that she's over-bearing, doesn't approve of her relationship with the pathetic pile of excrement that passes as a protagonist and punishes her daughter for being late for supper. Here's the thing, having a character with a strained relationship to their parents is fine. It's something a lot of people deal with. The problem is that Blanda's response just comes across as completely whiny and disproportionate. She'd rather be actually risking her life than living in safety as a rich girl and dealing with her over-bearing mum? That aside, the characters are pretty much the same tired archetypes as they were and the bulk of new characters are every bit as trite. Which is why the tragedy really doesn't work.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is the one area where I can be generally positive to the series. The online worlds are vibrant. They've got some interesting monsters, although they do forget that Thor was ginger. The action sequences are genuinely good. And this one doesn't include fan-service of the girl who's barely in High school. So, nothing to complain about there. It's kind of sad that that qualifies as an improvement over the first series, though.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThey got some good actors for this series. The problem is that they don't give them material that allows them to demonstrate their skills. Like the first series, we get a lot of listless lines. A lot of exaggerated lines and very few moments where we can hear the actors' talents. The best performance is probably from Sawashiro Miyuki, since she does get some intense scenes during the first arc. The music is all right. Not good, but it's okay.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't any. Although I'm kind of glad given how terrible the romantic dialogue is in this series.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nThere we have it. The second series of Sword Art Online. With all of that, is it an improvement over the first? Well, a little. It does have a plot point that actually works. The incest sub-plot that dominated the second half of the first series is barely present here and we don't spend a bunch of time looking at the breasts and bum of a girl who just started High school. That being said, it's still bad. The first arc's plot suffers from a massive bit of idiocy. Not only were these actual murderers released from the game with no charges brought against them but the authorities didn't even keep track of who they were. I know, I've said that four times at this point but it's just so dumb. The romantic dialogue is atrocious. The characters are dull and Blanda in particular is outright annoying. If you can get past the level to which the future portrayed in this is imbecilic, you don't care about complex characters and you just want some solid action sequences then you might... might enjoy watching this. Otherwise, I don't recommend it. My final rating is a 3/10. Next week I'm looking at JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Stardust Crusaders.",

            "content": "Every once in a while, an anime hits the public like a bomb, and the masses seem to love it. Then come the hipsters, with their, always unchanging arguments such as \"The last well made anime was Dracula the Vampire from the year 1930 everything after that is BS.\" and \"LN/Manga is so much better, don't waste your time.\". Now those arguments usually apply to shows that are loved by many people. Of course, I'm not trying to determine whether anime loved by many are bad or good, but it's surprising how a small amount of people started bashing on SAO, and then more followed.Well I guess it's in the human nature to imitate what others, who appear smarter than themselves, do. Nevertheless SAO is a true masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nStory(9/10): Honestly, it's hard to follow up to the success that SAO presented. But the job here's done pretty well. The pacing is quite pleasing. There are no unnecessary prolongings or speed ups in the development. The story is not too complicated but also not easy to see through. It easily keeps you immersed and craving for another episode. One of those shows you just want to marathon! Drama is perhaps more emphasized in contrary to it's prequel. However that's not necessarily a bad thing, it all depends on your preference. What I didn't like was maybe the standalone episodes towards the end. But then again, the feels while watching this are incredible. Something you definitely wouldn't expect form this genre, but SAO just doesn't fail to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nArt(10/10) Not much to say here honestly. Not many changes, the quality is top notch. Especially the \"Sword Skills\" and guns, very well done. We still have them breathtaking backgrounds of both the virtual, and the real world as well. All in all much like SAO it's pretty likeable, without any notable flaws.\\n\\n\r\nSound(9/10) Well, just one word- unbelievable. Not only did the voice acting of the old characters stay awesome, but so did the new ones. Sinon's voice fits her perfectly, it's just incredible. However the ending song might not be so fitting for an anime like this. It just doesn't have the power and the feeling that the opening song does. And maybe the keyboard(or piano, or an instrument like that, with keys xD) solos that quite often appeared in the prequel lacked. They intensify the strength of those moments that just give you the feels, but I feel as if they didn't appear enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(10/10) The old crew is here. Kirito, or actualy Kazuto, is still the same. The one everyone believes in, and put their hopes in. Someone, who, after suffering in \"real world\" found something worth living for in the \"virtual world\". There he worked harder and smarter than anyone else, and he gets what he deserves. And of course Asuna, who might be a bit neglected in the beginning, but towards the end you'll see that isn't so. This show focuses a bit on her too, and her outside-SAO-life. Then the rest of the old cast, usually in a humorous enviroment, like Klein,Suguha, Silica and Liz. And of course Sinon, who you'll find out more about as you see the show. Her character development is the most emphasized in the first half, for sure. But so is Kirito's and Asuna's, for sure, through the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(11/10) I can't even begin to stress out how glad I am for waiting this anime to finish airing before seeing it, or else I wouldn't be able to wait another week until the new episode. It just keeps you wanting for more, without any fan service, without unnecessary over-emphasized action scenes, or women drooling over the mc for no obvious reason and in excess,  and such mediocrities. It's really quite unbelievable and hard to put in a review,to express it in words you just *have to* see it for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(10/10) SAO II is truly a work of art. I'm not sure how well it is adapted, but I believe that is hardly relevant. Anime and Manga and LN-s are not the same things, and are not supposed to be exactly the same, just like books and movies aren't identical. That makes it all the more entertaining. And SAO is just incredible, and breathtaking. Art, drama, action, tactics and mystery, and above all human relations and romance development. I would recommend SAO to those who want something enjoyable, and fun, that will make you \"feely\" and really think about the possibilities of the future, and the possibilities of the present that you possess. :)\\n",

            "content": "Hello everyone, this is the sequel to my previous review Sword Art Online. And there is a Video Review on my Youtube as well, but here is the written.\r\nStory - 6/10\r\nSpoiler Alert ahead as this may spoil Sword Art Online 1.\r\nThere is 3 Arcs in Sword Art Online 2, and I would say they were definitely better stories than the second half of Sword Art Online. The first arc is an investigation murder mystery arc, which sort of continued over from the previous season. The arc in between us more a light-hearted adventure with friends arc. And the 3rd and final arc is a comingof age story. All these arcs, in my opinion were better than the second half of Sword Art Online, which left me a sour taste in my mouth after finishing it.\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc is based in a multiplayer shooter online game. Virtual Reality Gaming has taken another step in the future. Players can compete in an online game competition and earn in game money, and they can use that in game money and convert it to real money, thus making it a profession, the main game being Gun Gale Online. Some people have taken an offense to this, particularly the people who were trapped in Sword Art Online, and now one of the members from the Laughing Coffin, a guild back in SAO, that use to kill other players is back to show the people playing what\u2019s it\u2019s really like to die. Now when you die in all these games, you don\u2019t die in real life, however this Death Gun goes around killing players, so it\u2019s a mystery on how these players actually really die. Kirito is bought back and he\u2019s been given the mission to find this killer, so it\u2019s a crime investigation story. He meets a player name Sinon along the way, and gets her to help him learn the game, I\u2019ll go more into Sinon later.\\n\\n\r\nThe story for this arc grips you, because you\u2019re going to stick with it, to find out who the killer is, plus finding out how they pull it off in a game where you\u2019re not supposed to die, is kind of exciting. However I do find one part of the story rather annoying towards the end of the arc, where they were stuck in cave talking and talking about themselves and Death Gun, it was really a dragging conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc is much shorter, than all the other arcs, it\u2019s only 3 episode long. However it really brings back what the gaming genre is about, having fun and playing with friends. It follows the ensemble cast of the series, and they go on a quest in ALfhiem Online, that quest is to gain the most powerful sword in the game known as Excalibur. It\u2019s a really light hearted story and actually felt like a true game was being played, however it didn\u2019t have the epic scale the first SAO had. But I did like how some minor characters got some good attention during the arc, especially Klein and Sinon, even though if they were minor.\\n\\n\r\nThe third and final arc has a similar theme with the second as it\u2019s more about playing with friends. However the arc does not focus on Kirito at all, and focuses on Asuna. Yes possibly the most annoying character in the series, however she was sort of redeemed in this arc. But anyway she is asked to join this guild to beat a boss and get their name engraved on a memorial, because these group of people only have a small time to beat it before they move on with their personal lives. Asuna is also given the decision to either continue with her gaming or continue on with her life as her mother suggest. She doesn\u2019t know what she wants to do outside of gaming, and plays the theme gaming and personal lives. \\n\\n\r\nWhat this arc does really well is how emotional it is. It really is a much slower pace arc, and that could appeal to some people, but then cannot. However if it\u2019s making you feel emotional, that\u2019s doing something right. \\n\\n\r\nEven with these great stories and interesting arcs, it never solved the one problem SAO left us. Why did Kayaba Akihiko trapped the players in Sword Art Online, what was the reason behind all that. These stories are great as a standalone, but the overarching story had no progression. This whole season of Sword Art Online 2 just felt like filler. The stories were good, but I didn\u2019t feel that epic scale the first half of Sword Art Online gave us. And to slap us in the face, they teased something about Kayaba Akihiko at the very end to just cut in abruptly. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nKirito makes a return as the main protagonist, and he\u2019s still op as hell even in a new game. The game being played is a shooting game, and he owns all the players with a sword/lightsaber. He is pretty much a jedi. He\u2019s job is to find who the killer of Gun Gale Online is, of course as a newbie in a new game he should be a novice at it, fixing his overpowered status from the previous SAO, wrong. Apart from being the agent, he\u2019s given the role as the person with the same similarity as the killer and the second protagonist. There\u2019s still not that much character development for Kirito, even in the later arcs, he sorts of comes off as a power hungry gaming arrogant douche. Also why the hell does Kirito look like a girl in GGO.\\n\\n\r\nFinally we get to the main star of the second season, not only the second season, but I think overall the most interesting character SAO has come up with, that is of course Sinon. Now Sinon has a messed up past, as when she was kid she killed someone with a gun, and hence has developed Hoplophobia. That even gun shaped objects frighten her. However to overcome it she plays Gun Gale Online to get use to holding a gun, and she\u2019s very good player at that. What I love about Sinon is her development, while she\u2019s in game she\u2019s a calm and cool and a badass, only to be outshine by Kirito here and there\u2026yeah still disappointed with that fact. However in the real world Sinon is actually a vulnerable girl, and you can actually see the confidence and development she gains by playing more GGO, and it\u2019s not an instant development as well, even in the end, you can see that smooth development. It wasn\u2019t the instant oh I\u2019m over guns now. Her character literally carried Sword Art Online 2. It\u2019s ashamed she was pretty much to Kirito\u2019s harem during the second half and played a minor bit.\\n\\n\r\nAsuna takes the role as the main protagonist for the 3rd Arc of series. And I would say she is slightly redeemed in the Mother Rosario arc. She\u2019s much more enthusiastic about her new friends she makes during the arc and learns a lot from them. Which becomes a journey of self-discovery, she still starts off as whiny brat, but during the arc she comes to find out what she wants to be as she grows up. \\n\\n\r\nYuuki is the other protagonist of the Mother Rosario arc. While in game she\u2019s a very go lucky happy player, but she has a side to her that is rather dark. And it\u2019s because of that side, she helps Asuna make a decision on her coming of age story. She is also the only player to have beaten Kirito in duel as well, to somewhat prove he\u2019s not the most overpowered character. Her character is engaging and if you are to feel emotional towards her story, you know they\u2019ve done something right\\n\\n\r\nSure there were a lot more focus on some of the characters this time around. Espcially Sinon, however all the other characters are developed less. Doesn\u2019t help the fact there is no overall story progression.  \\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 8/10 - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art style is really the same from the first Sword Art Online. What it does really well is the dark eerie urban atmosphere of Gun Gale Online. It really suits the setting, and makes that world feel more alive. The art style for ALO is still very bright to suit the gaming world, and the action scenes are still great as they were back in the first season. Little details a back such as in game hud and effects make it more like a real game. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is really top notch as well with bullet sounds really matching when they are shooting and their gun counterparts, plus Kirito\u2019s sword in GGO really sounds like lightsaber.  And each soundtrack for each arc really suits it style and theme. The opening and ending songs for this season however, is not as fun to listen to from the previous season, they\u2019re good but not that good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment factor was less this time around, because I didn\u2019t feel the stakes or epic scale the first season delivered. The stories were good but didn\u2019t progress or answered any of the previous season questions. Sinon\u2019s character kept me going, I was really interested in her development, not to say the other characters were bad, but they weren\u2019t as developed as Sinon. The second half made me feel emotional, but it\u2019s not the most emotional thing I\u2019ve felt in anime. The first half is a hybrid crime thriller, while the second half is more about gaming with friends. As story progression, I felt I was slapped in the face, because after all that happened this whole season I felt cheated because it felt like filler. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m going to do something different about my review this time around. For the story, I\u2019m going to give it a 6, as I believe the stories were good, but they didn\u2019t have the huge of a dramatic scale feel from the first season, and plus not progressing or answers questions from the season before.\\n\\n\r\nFor the art and sound I give them both an 8, because, I reckon it\u2019s the same quality art style we got from the previous season, hence there wasn\u2019t really any major improvement. It\u2019s still very good to look at.\\n\\n\r\nFor Characters I\u2019m giving it an 8, literally because Sinon carried that first half, and Yuuki being an interesting character as well. Asuna got some minor attention and development and same goes for Kirito, but they weren\u2019t developed as much or as interesting as their co-stars their respective arcs.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for my own personal enjoyment I give it a 6, as I didn\u2019t really enjoy the 2nd season as much, because it didn\u2019t really keep me on my feet with an epic high stakes death game. And plus watching it all made me feel kind of cheated as it felt like filler after the end.\\n\\n\r\nSo after rounding that all up, I give Sword Art Online II a 7/10. I recommend only watching it if you\u2019ve watched the first season of Sword Art Online, and want to see more of that universe, just don\u2019t expect too much change for the better from the previous season, it doesn\u2019t blow me away.",

            "content": "So this is my first review on this site, so be gentle on the rating lol.\r\nok so,\r\n I was pretty disappointed with the second season of SAO. The GGO idea was ok, but like some of you [I'm sure I'm not the only one] feel like SAO should have ended at season 1. I'm a romance anime kind of guy so I try to pay attention more the the characters then the plot, but all the same I've got a few problems with SAO2's plot&characters.\r\nSinoon\r\nI didn't like her from the start. She's your typical gun girl holding that giant piece of hardware and wielding itlike she's the bad ass they would have you believe she is. She isn't. She's just some girl who Kirito bumps into in GGO, and happens to have PTSD after a run in with some random who was holding up a post office. You heard right, a post office. It's these types of cliche's that made SAO2 unattractive to me in the first place. She's there as eye candy for the first half of the season then fades into the mist of Kirito's harem.\\n\\n\r\nKirito\\n\r\nThe man we all know and love. Not this season ladies. He was very underwhelming unlike in season 1. He felt weaker and less like a hero. Despite all the logical flaws in sending a kid in to do the governments dirty work, and magically develops PTSD. He manages to overcome his PTSD, and defeats the bad guy with little to no plot at all. So what? He beat some mini game that supposedly is impossible for everyone else. He buys a light saber [sword] and continues to be a sword user even though he's playing a game that involves the use of guns. Makes sense right? The writers didn't seem to care enough to give much plot to the bad guy other then to kill kill kill! Whats worse off though, Kirito beats this guy in the biggest tournament in the game. Tell me how Kirito manages to get into a tourny this big without any kind of prerequisite other then having played the game for 5 minutes, and manages to stay alive long enough to beat him in a match with the biggest gun slingers on GGO? I think the writers got lazy and just wanted to make a quick buck riding off the fame of the first season. The second part is about a small quest to find the legendary weapon Excalibur. I can accept this little story somewhat, but there was almost no plot to it. they had 2 hours to complete some story that should have taken WAY more episodes to develop plot to. Then Kirito manages to fade into the mist as the baton was passed to Asuna.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Gun\\n\r\nVery under rated bad guy. He literally was just some nut they could have picked up off the street given some nerve gear and was told to start killing peeps. That's how little this bad guy meant to this part of the story. So ask yourselves why did they spend half the season with this guy when he had little to do with it. Other then Death Gun himself, you find out his little brother was that creepy kid who was close friends with Sinoon. Oh but the way they reveal that was soo origional. Hey, I heard you won so I came over to celebrate. SURPRISE RAPE! Bam, we find out he was one of the guys and then they get caught and it's all over. What the hell was the point of this entire season am I right?\\n\\n\r\nAsuna\\n\r\nNot much to say other then I'm glad she was given a little more air-time with her personal life. I kind of wish Kirito would have been more relevant to her problems [makes for a more cute romance], but we can't always have what we want now can we?\\n\\n\r\nThe girl I forgot the name of and you will too\\n\r\nYes, I literally just finished watching this season not even 5 minutes ago, and I already forgot her name. That's how little she meant to this season. Why do writers add characters who last for no more then 5 episodes then kill them off? I'll tell you why. It's because they either realized they screwed up big time with this or they figured they had your money by this point so who cares [or they are really stupid]. I honestly can't say much about this character other then she was random and stronger than Kirito. WHAT? FOR REALSIES? Unfortunately that was the case. I hate when an anime has some random character show up then kill them off like it was nothing. I hate it even more when this character plays a significant role of some kind. Seriously though, all I remember is that she was stronger then Kirito, then died. The relevance is astounding.\\n\\n\r\nThe Harem\\n\r\nLittle relevance to the story other then introducing the last arc to the season by mentioning the super powered player that no one say coming then all of a sudden cared that they died. Still wants Kirito's babies, Klein is the guy who can't catch a break with girls [insert typical lonely loser jokes].\\n\\n\r\nStory 1/10\\n\r\nNothing good can be said about the story. I've already read the majority of comments. So I'm not alone in this one. I don't agree with all the hate on SAO season 1, but I will say this much. I had heard that there was a choice to either make SAO season 2, or Accel World season 2. They chose the wrong one. I remember telling myself season 2 of SAO won't be very good, and I wasn't wrong. I'm just glad that season 2 of Accel World might still happen.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nJust because the story sucked doesn't mean it's not SAO. The origional art was beautiful, and SAO season 2 is no different. I fell in love with how beautiful the art was. How visually stunning the fights/background/etc. was.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nSome new songs, but the same old fight sound track as before. I was hoping for a new more epic \"fighting sequence\" song, but that doesn't mean the old one was bad. I was okay with it, but like I said: could have been a new more epic song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 3/10\\n\r\nLittle is to be said about the new characters. Literally little to be said. The one that stuck around become another harem candidate, while the other died before falling into the same role. No real development for the new character's other then learning that Kirito had another hidden run in with the laughing coughin guild, and magicly has PTSD out of nowhere from it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10\\n\r\nIt's another SAO. That's pretty much it. Nothing else really. If I enjoyed anything, it would be the art and sound. So 2 out of everything else.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 2/10\\n\r\nSAO vs. SAO2\\n\r\nI won't deny it. I loved SAO. SAO 2 ruined that for me. I think less of SAO now because of SAO 2. It's like that nice candy you liked until you ate too much of it and got sick. Now you can't eat it anymore without remembering that you got sick from it. Let's face it. SAO2 flopped, and HARD. There was one tolerable arc and it didn't even last more then what? 2 episodes maybe? The quest for Excalibur, and it wasn't even that good with how little plot it received. I wish Asuna and Kirigaya's relationship got a little deeper, infact at the end of all that crap I found myself hoping that he would maybe propose to her to indirectly save her from her mothers tyrannical betroths, but I was sorely disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend this to anyone who was a hardcore fan of season 1, but I'm not an expert anime critic. I'm just some dude who likes what I like. If you liked SAO2 then good for you. I'm glad you liked it, but I for one am dreading a season 3, if they are stupid enough to make a season 3 that is.",

Despite hopes being high for this series, it didn't quite deliver in some cases.\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe \"Gun Gale Online\" arc, and the \"Mothers Rosario\" arc were as good as I would have expected, but sadly the (Ex)\"Caliber\" arc was reminiscent of the second part of the 1st season. In other words, bad and unneeded. This brings the story down to a 6, from 8.\r\nArt: 9\r\nNothing much has changed in the art, but the 1st glimpse of the cyber-punk world of GGO left me in awe, and Itruly wished that there were any amazing game worlds like that. Overall the are is still very good, and offers a lot of colour in the \"fantasy\" world\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nStill the same band of characters, with exceptions to Shino and Yuuki, and I feel that both these characters have good depth, and development. The latter had a huge impact on me, as I also have a friend who suffers with the same condition (Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nIf you rule out the horrific third arc in this story, this series was not bad, and in fact quite enjoyable.

            "content": "I'll never know why this gets infinitely more hate than its legitimately inferior predecessor...\r\n*SOME SPOILERS FOR SAO II. THIS WILL BE A GIANT REVIEW*\r\nAh, SAO II. A sequel to one of the most divisive and critically panned pieces of entertainment in history, right next to Batman V Superman. Ok, but in all seriousness, there were many people sucked into SAO's world and many people (especially critics) that found the product worse than Sonic 06. That makes the reception of this sequel a bit of a roller coaster. In the beginning, people had hope that it would trump its predecessor in quality, and for the mostpart, thought that it was at least an improvement, and many critics on places like MAL (such as Stark700 and ZephSilver) acknowledge that it's at least an improvement. But that begs the question: How did the reception for this sequel tank to the point of being .48 points lower and over 1500 ranks lower on MAL? Especially during arguably the best arc of the franchise up until that point. What happened to create such a shift in reception to the point where a majority of the vocal internet users actively hate this, including those who loved the first season? Well, we may not exactly answer all of these questions, since I still wonder some of them myself, by for the ones we CAN answer, let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nBefore we tackle the three arcs individually, I have a few things to say overall. This takes place some time after the events of the first season, and now, new virtual reality games like GGO have popped up, but without much possibility of death or being trapped for years on end. ALO is still thriving, and has become basically SAO with wings, which is infinitely better than before since you can fly in Aincrad, but you can't physically die. Now, I'm aware that this series does have its fair share of problems in the story department, especially in the beginning and middle. Hell, Digibro went in depth about it. Particularly with the first arc. With that said, let's jump right in!\\n\\n\r\nA game called GGO (Gun Gale Online) has launched up, and apparently there's an unknown player has found a way to kill the players physically despite being so far away IRL and has declared himself \"Death Gun\", Y'know. Referencing Death Note is a bit classy. Well, Kirito, against his better judgement, decides to listen to his government Shane that begs him to do so, and becomes familiar with GGO via an experienced player named Sinon after ending up with a feminine looking avatar for some reason, which he used to his advantage since he knows the art of SEX APPEEEEEAAALLL!! They compete in this game called the \"Bullet of Bullets 3\", implying that this is the third of its kind, and that they know that the killer is likely to participate. Also, personal info is optional, and Deah Gun exploits this, even though that's bad game design. At least you people can stop complaining about how nobody can track the guy. He obviously didn't put the info in. Also, he finds a purple light saber (cuz Star Wars is cool), and uses it despite that you should never bring a sword to a gunfight. Silly, I know, but his coordination in games with swords in astounding, and he isn't too shabby IRL. They play this game, trying to find out who the killer is, and we have very few notable newcomers, making it easier to narrow down the choices, in case you didn't realize how bad the OP F**KED UP by basically showing you. OOPS! Well, it's one of Sinon's friends, plus two other dudes (which is ridiculous in its own right) and before we tie into that, a few things. Both mains are full of trauma over their pasts. Sinon's is understandable and honestly compelling, ignoring some silly mistakes later down the road (this game is like therapy for her, yet she still freezes up occasionally). For Kirito, we get this flashback to an attack on Laughing Coffin from SAO 1, except that never happened, making this very confusing, and even more if you realize how quickly Kirito recovered from all his traumas back in season 1. Well, they win and the best friend eventually tried to rape (kinda) and then kill her IRL, until Kirito literally fights the dude, and Sinon knocks him out via a boom box to the head. Also, after this is a delegate recap episode, so not touching that any further. It's kinda weird how Sinon resolves her gun and bullying issue (yeah, after she shoots a robber, she gets both traumatized and ostracized for it for years), but eh. Moving on.\\n\\n\r\nNext, three filler episodes! Literally the only reasons for the Excalubr arc are so that Kirito's friends can do something aside from being literal spectators in the first arc, and so Kirito can get Caliburn, which he literally throws out like a total dickwad, so that was a waste. Klein gets this mini-romance arc, but it doesn't add much. It's basically a side-quest to get the gang together. It adds very little.\\n\\n\r\nNow, for the reason the story section actually gets a passing grade: the Mother's Rosario arc! Hands down, the best arc of SAO! It actually gives Kirito a rest, giving his GF Asuna, the spotlight. She meets a badass player named Yuuki, who is even more OP than Kirito. She and the Sleeping Knights guild wanna engrave their names onto something as physical proof that they existed. Why? Because their leader, Yuuki has AIDS, is expected to die soon, and is surrounded by others the guild who suffer similar fates, albeit with no clue of when they'll die. Sounds like a combo of messed up, silly, and tragic. It kind of is, but t ends in a pretty sad yet hopeful finale. It also has a subplot about how Asuna's mother hates the fact that she visits this online world and continuing a romance with Kirito rather than I dunno, dedicating all her time to upcoming college. At one point, when Yuuki, Asuna, and the Sleeping Knights try to clear the Floor 27 boss (for reasons stated above), they get ambushed by some assholes who want the glory for themselves instead. And guess who shows up? Kirito and Klein! That's right, they get to have a badass moment of awesome deus ex machina style, well, mostly Kirito, who some who now has Caliburn. Klein gets in a bit after and is reprimanded for being late to the party by Kirito, but they kick some ass offscreen regardless. Yuuki also meets Kirito, but not in they way you think. Yuuki's condition is so bad, that she is close to death and is basically resorting to living in a medical game machine to make sure that she can at least move around and interact, so Kirito engineers a way for them to communicate despite one being online and the other being IRL. It's all a beautiful, tragic, and pleasant story, albeit kinda silly. Like I said, the ending is a bit silly at moments, but it's still both tragic and hopeful, with literally everyone seeing Yuuki off as she dies, and somehow all of the Sleeping Knights nor suffering death for...who knows. Nobody knows when they'll die, but they claim that maybe it's Yuuki's way of saying that it's not their time. Plus, apparently, one of Kayaba's associates finds Kirito and talks about things. It all ends with the gang getting together pleasantly IRL.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, it's silly, and full of problems, but this season has some pretty amazing moments, ESPECIALLY by SAO standards (which aren't all that high). Well, at least it gives me more hope overall than last time, and makes sure that I'm less hesitant to start when the next installment comes out.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOk, let's get the returning cast outta the way. Kirito is basically the same as ever, only with more capability to switch at the drop of a hat from PTSD to regular to inspirational, and honestly, this somehow makes him more interesting than before since he's using his experiences to teach someone how to get over her PTSD despite the fact that he's basically still coping with his. If the anime conveyed that better, that would've been a great subplot in the first arc. Asuna get's back to her roots, sorta. She's still Kirito's girlfriend, but in the final arc in particular, she gets the chance to not only show off that she's a badass, but she get's to show some attachment to new friends, and that she has issues at home, making her way better than in the first season by default. The side-characters are basically the same, but with less screen time, yet more IRL time.\\n\\n\r\nFor newcomers, let's start with Sinon. She's a badass GGO sniper who has PTSD over the incident in which she shot a robber that was about to kill her already crazy mother. She has to suffer the wrath of bullies and her own trauma thanks to the incident, and continues to do so up until high school. It's a bit odd how her arc resolves and how no one likes her or celebrates her based on the incident, but meh. It's thanks to Kirito that she eventually gets over it. She's otherwise a strong sniper girl badass, only with more coherence to emotion, making her one of the best characters in the franchise, which doesn't say to much actually, considering you're comparing good to mediocre. Next, Shinkawa, otherwise known as Death Gun himself. He seems to be a nice and supportive side-character friend, but he's a little to crazy for Sinon, and a little too crazy in general, seeing as this was all his idea. Luckily, he gets his ass kicked. Next, we have Yuuki. I don't understand the hate she recieves. Is it because she's stronger than Kirito? That's a stupid reason, especially since she has more of a personality. She's bubbly and cheerful, and absolutely adorable! However, this is used as a way for her to be a Stehproid Smiler since she doesn't want to reveal to Asuna that she has AIDS. She keeps calling her big sister, and when Asuna addresses that, she logs off crying, knowing that the truth is almost revealed. As a matter a fact, (the OP for the arc kinda alluded to this) her sister already DIED before they got the chance to fulfil their goal, and as such, Asuna kinda reminds her of her big sister,'probably because she doesn't want to let her big sister go. Well, she dies, and that's the end of that. However, it should be noted that she didn't want her friends to mourn, but isn't surprised when in the game, when everyone seen her off, that her friends can hold back the tears for too long, but assures that they'll all be ok, and her she'll still be with them. Speaking of her friends, the Sleeping Knights make for a decent cast of side-characters with different personalities, and are arguably more interesting than a majority of the returning cast. Hell, they should get their own side-story involving their time in the game and how they got their illnesses. Well, that just about covers everyone relevant. Moving on.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nA-1 Pictures stepped up their game to make of of the best looking shows of their gigantic repitoire to date. The worlds have different feels to them but with a lot of craft into making GGO look gritty (especially the promo art with the Lockon in the background and everything looking epic and gritty) and ALO look more lively than ever. The action is still as frantic as ever, but with more diversity. We actually get soem sniping, a gun v sword fight via Death Gun and Kirito which is about as cool and bombastic as it is silly (Death Gun literally explodes), and even a proper sword fight via a very fluid and well done Asuna v Yuuki fight. Hell, the OPS look better than ever, even if the material in the OPs isn't good (as Mother's Basement mentioned). They look much more visually stunning, especially with certain effects. Don't even get me started on how good the beautiful folded paper effects look in ED 1 of the season. You seed to see to believe it. The character models look the same, but Yuuki's facial expressions can get to Studio Bones levels of goofy expressive. Part of her charm. Well, sucks that the show is even pervier then the first one. Hell, it even has a shot that swoops down at Sinon's ass in order to come back up a second later. Was this supposed to piss off our side-character spectators? They never showed if it did. Meh, the art is a step up, and honestly, I still had a hard time deciding if I wanted to give it a 9 or a 10, but eh. It's the best looking A-1 pictures show to date, which is surprising considering it came out 2 years ago.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOP 3 (1 for this season, 3 overall) \"Ignite\" is a very good track that kinda sets the tone for the first arc, even if the content literally spoils the mystery like a clucking dumbass. Next, OP 4, \"Courage\". It has two versions. One for the filler arc, which has the weakest direction, and one for the Mother's Rosario arc, which is the most vibrant OP of the bunch, which is typical considering how much better that arc is compared to the rest of SAO. The music is stil a pretty decent track all things considered. The ED 1 of the season, \"Startear\" is a beautiful track, and is one of the most lovely EDs I've ever seen. ED 2, Kimi no Time Machine\" by LiSA is another endearing track, and well, is of course, another lovely LiSA song. ED 3, which is also done by LiSA, isn't nearly as good as any of the other ones that came before it, not that it's bad or anything. Just, inferior. The OST, composed by Yuki Kajiura yet again, is a bit on par with last time, albeit, with a few more interesting tracks this time around. As for the dub, the returning cast is still mixed, albeit some characters with worse performances never came back. The new guys are about as mixed, albeit Death Gun sounds as badass in English as in Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc was kind of interesting in my book despite being a bit bring in places. It had a cool yet ridiculous final fight, and the scene with Sinon's live being in danger is legitimately crazy and tense, especially when she knocks Shinkawa out with a Boom Box. The second arc, was mildly entertaining, albeit kind of upsetting at points. The final arc was captivating and legitimately sad, more so than anything before it and around the same as early parts of season 1 respectively. I really loved that arc, and so do many, despite only being vocal about it long after it was too late for this series to get positive reception. There are definitely some face-palm worthy moments, but it was still more entertaining and captivating than season 1.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7/10    RAW SCORE: 6.91/10\\n\\n\r\nNow, is SAO II good? On some levels, yes and on others, no; this is still Sword Art Online after all.. However, if you ever wanna say that this season was worse than last, just ask yourself: What other anime tactfully tackles AIDS? I mean, for that alone this has to be at least on par with season 1, right? Hell, the visuals are far improved too with less awkward moments and a lot less of the awful CGI we saw occasionally for minutes in end in the first season. The story overall isn't great and it does still share a good amount of the flaws of the original season, but this was certainly an improvement in character building, actual characters, visuals, and even story, though that doesn't mean that SAO II actually achieves greatness. Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "A lot of people watch this after season 1, but they find they can't really get into it that much. It's not that exciting. Let me tell you why I think that is.\r\nI think the main problem with SAO is the source material. If it weren't for the terrible writing they had to base the show on this anime could have really shone. Production values are excellent, both sound and visuals are very good, the voice actors gave it their all, and there was a lot of potential in the premise and the characters. People say the second season is the weaker of the two.It's obvious why that is the case: the second season relies on the story a lot more than season 1. SAO was about pure badass awesomeness and heaps of cool fight scenes, not to mention Asuna's oh-so-desirable er.. cooking skills. Season 2 is more about the relationships between people, less about badass awesomeness, and since the source material is so infantile it fails to capture any depth in the drama. The story feels like its trying so hard to manipulate you into caring about the characters that in the end it fails simply because it pushed too hard. \\n\\n\r\nFor me the highlight of season 2 is Shino's Japanese voice. I thought her performance was outstanding, especially during the duel and the cave scene. The dialogue may have been clunky and cringe-worthy, but she did it all the justice a lady could do.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the season is a dull grey blur to me. The badass awesome action comes back occasionally, but the fact that this is all that helps drag the viewer back is a pretty severe indictment. If you want that just watch season 1.\\n\\n\r\nAt first I was impressed by the treatment of PTSD and the portrayal of how Kirito helps Shinon deal with it, but after a while a few questions started to pop up in my mind. Why does Kirito bond so quickly with this chick he has met only a day ago? How does he know what to say when he hasn't properly dealt with his own trauma? How is it Shinon has no support network after what happened? Why does Death Gun want to kill her? Why does she so quickly forgive Kirito for leading her on? Normally you could forgive them for skipping over those issues but since the whole point of the GGO arc is about PTSD and relationships they really need to explain it. They could have done away with all the shots of Shinon's crotch to make time for a proper story, heck they could have tossed the rest of the ALO nonsense, but the fact that they didn't says they don't care that much about the story or their audience.",

            "content": "\"It's not enough to live for your own happiness, but to live for the happiness of others, which in turn, brings you greater happiness.\"\r\nSword Art Online II is a story about the convergence of the virtual and real world, exploring and questioning our perceptions of current reality, of the meaning of life, of hope, of strength and of courage to fight on. At least that's what it tries to be anyway. While SAO II continues to suffer from plot holes and poor character development, it has continued to excel in animation, screenplay and sound aspects. Well, let's move on...\r\nTL;DR\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nArt: 10/10\r\nSound: 10/10\r\nCharacter: 6/10\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\r\nOverall: 6/10(rounded down from 6.5)\\n\\n\r\nGood points:\\n\r\n+ Great quick-paced action\\n\r\n+ Exciting, suspenseful first arc\\n\r\n+ Cool female main lead (Sinon)\\n\r\n+ Very emotional final arc\\n\r\n+ Very cute characters in general\\n\r\n+ Excellent animation and sound\\n\\n\r\nBad points:\\n\r\n- Completely irrelevant and pointless second arc\\n\r\n- Some action / emotional scenes too dragged out\\n\r\n- Mess of underdeveloped supporting cast\\n\r\n- A set of confusing and shallow antagonists\\n\r\n- An entire host of plot holes\\n\r\n- Repetitive back stories and repetitive lines\\n\r\n- Lack of character development in some main characters (Kirito/Yuuki)\\n\r\n- Overpowered, one-dimensional male lead (Kirito)\\n\\n\r\nYou will enjoy this anime if:\\n\r\n1. You stop watching after episode 14.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nSAO II is split into 3 main arcs - the Phantom Bullet arc (featuring Death Gun), the Caliburn arc (featuring Excalibur) and the Mother's Rosario Arc (featuring Yuuki). I will discuss the three arcs separately because they are portrayed as 3 completely different story arcs in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn the Phantom Bullet arc, which I personally thought was the best arc out of the three, we start off with some mystery and suspense - A hooded, cloaked figure shoots an avatar through a screen and lo and behold, the real person playing the game actually gets killed. Kirito is then sent to GGO to investigate the mystery behind \"Death Gun\", and I really liked the suspense the built up in the first few episodes. (+1 for interest)\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, it takes all the up to episode 4 for Kirito to even begin playing GGO, and most of the time is wasted on watching Asuna and Kirito's romance and Sinon's random PKing adventures. Even after Kirito enters GGO and meets Sinon, the best sniper in GGO, it takes them another 2 more episodes (doing minor things like shopping for weapons, earning money, riding a buggy, Kirito acting like a girl) before they even start the actual Bullet of Bullets 3 tournament, which Kirito is convinced will somehow lead him to Death Gun (luckily, he is right though). The build-up for the Phantom Bullet arc is really slow, all the way up to at least the point where Kirito starts his qualifier fights.\\n\\n\r\nThings get slightly more interesting when Death Gun appears behind Kirito all of a sudden after his first battle, and threatens him with death (although when we finally get the reveal as to how Death Gun makes his kills, we know there is no way Death Gun has any means of finding Kirito and killing him). As the tension and suspense builds, Kirito and Sinon have more pointless quarrels and face-offs before they finally agree that it's best they team up to take down Death Gun, who has made it a point to start killing off some of the main tournament participants as well. Things peak off when Death Gun actually manages to take down Sinon and almost kills her, if it weren't for Kirito's deus-ex-accuracy which he never had with a gun (having never played GGO before). Kirito and Sinon eventually manages to escape to a deserted cave and make their final preparations for finishing off Death Gun.\\n\\n\r\nJust when you thought there was going to be more action, the anime disappoints again and makes us watch an entire full episode of Sinon's backstory, as well as Kirito explaining Death Gun's backstory as a laughing coffin member over and over again. \\n\\n\r\nSinon's backstory of shooting a robber 5 years ago, managed to repeat itself 3 times - The first time was when she first opened her drawer in her room and saw a pistol which reminded her of the incident, the second time was when she encountered Death Gun and saw that Death Gun's pistol was *surprise surprise* the exact same model as the one used 5 years ago, and the third time was when she finally tells her backstory to Kirito in the cave.\\n\\n\r\nThe explanation of Death Gun's backstory also occurred 3 times repeatedly. The first time was when Kirito first sees the Laughing Coffin insignia on Death Gun's hand (which for some reason is still there even though Death Gun doesn't want Kirito to remember his name), the second time was when Asuna and Klein were explaining to the rest of the party (Lisbeth, Yui, Suguha, Silica) who were watching the GGO tournament about who Death Gun was, and the third time, again, was when Kirito finally explains the story to Sinon in the cave.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, either anime thinks the audience is so dumb that they had to re-emphasize the same concepts 3 times over and over again, or they really had so little plot depth and development to put into this that they had to consistently give frequent flashbacks and reminders of the exact same thing. By this time, I could feel myself getting bored.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the conversation finally moves into figuring out how Death Gun did all of his murders, and we slowly get some deductions revealed to us. Unfortunately, there's some flaw in Kirito's reasoning. Apparently Death Gun has accomplices in real life and had to synchronize timing in order to ensure that his accomplice was in the target's room before the Death Gun shot. But, if the Death Gun accomplices are watching the live feed of the tournament in the first place, then wouldn't the cue to apply the killing blow to the target be when the target gets shot and not dependent on any exact timing? If the timing is only approximate to ensure that the killer is has already infiltrated the target's apartment, then shouldn't Death Gun check his watch long before he moves to attack the target, rather than checking it only right before he is about the shoot with the Death Gun? Sorry, but Death Gun using the cross symbol to \"disguise his checking of his watch\" explanation just got blown apart.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily though, the final battle against Death Gun proved to be an exciting one, with Kirito finally showing off some of his legit sword-slashing skills against the Red Eyed Xaxa. We also get to see more of Sinon's awesome sniping, which was pretty cool save for the fact that she only fired around two shots at maximum at any one time. Again though, after the final slash that Kirito delivers against Death Gun (also known as Sterben), a random explosion occurs for no apparent reason. This anime really loves unexplained random explosions.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the battle is over and all is done and dealt with, we finally learn the true motives of Death Gun which can be summarized in two words - revenge and jealously. Revenge first, against Zexceed, the person who mislead everyone to spend their skill points on agility and then beat everybody with a strength build, and then jealously for being unable to be as good as all the pro players in GGO. The pathetic motivations really reduced the impact of the minor twist that Shinkawa was secretly an accomplice targeting Sinon, but at least there was a twist, so I'll give a point. (+1 for slight twist)\\n\\n\r\nNext, Shion encounters the bullies who have been picking on her all this while, and for no apparent reason whatsoever, in this secluded corner of the school, there is an empty drink can set up on top of an overturned bucket on the ground, just waiting as if on cue for Shion to shoot and show the bullies who's boss at using the air rifle. Oh and btw, gun safety (facepalm).\\n\\n\r\nEverything wrapped up nicely at the end, but then Kirito receives an ominous message from the culprits: \"This isn't over... It's show time.\" But actually, the whole arc is over and they are not going to encounter Laughing Coffin again in the rest of the anime, so screw that stupid message for sending off the audience on a false red herring. And also, sadly, say good bye to the only plot arc that was actually decent in this anime, and hello to the plot arcs that were really messed up.\\n\\n\r\nThe next arc is the Caliburn arc, where Kirito and party go on quest to obtain Excalibur, a weapon that they only recently discovered existed by taming a flying elephant-octopus hybrid tyrant in the Jotunheimr and riding it back to Alfheim. Oh and by the way, the name of the tamed tyrant is Tonkii (that's either cute or unacceptable, you pick). Anyway, they realize that they are involved in something much greater because the fate of Alfheim rests on their hands - at least according to Urd, an NPC who randomly appeared to them while they were flying on Tonkii towards the secret Excalibur dungeon.\\n\\n\r\nThe next few episodes is spent on them clearing the Excalibur dungeon with lots of action, spells and an animated treat of Sword Skills, but of course adding nothing to the plot whatsoever. At the boss dungeon, they defeat the Frost Giant with the help of cameo characters Freiya and Thor, and in the end manage to get BOTH Mjollnir and Excalibur in one guest. Congratulations, unfortunately, no part of this entire arc seems significant or important whatsoever. No points for this entire, stupid, pointless arc.\\n\\n\r\nCoherence-wise, in episode 17, Kirito makes us believe that Excalibur was \"too heavy\" and willingly throws it off the platform so that he can jump onto Tonkii. But honestly, if he had the strength to swing it off the platform, then why couldn't he just swing it onto Tonkii? Why couldn't Tonkii just used his long trunk to pick up Excalibur instead? The entire scene was just a convenient way to make Kirito indebted to Sinon, since Sinon in the end used a grappling hook arrow to retrieve Excalibur anyway. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, later on, Kirito claims that his mechatronic skills enabled him to give Yui a 3D-experience and says \"Yui feels like she is flying around the room now.\" That's not possible with just one stationary camera. You would need that camera mounted on a mobile quadcopter to achieve that \"flying effect\" properly, otherwise Yui is just rotating the camera and is more like \"looking about\" than \"flying about\".\\n\\n\r\nThe following arc is the Mother's Rosario arc, where the main focus was really Asuna as a character and her interaction with Yuuki (first introduced as Zekken, the best swordswoman in Alfheim). The story goes as such - Asuna meets Yuuki for the first time in a duel, and Yuuki, having been impressed as Asuna's sword skills, invites her to join her party in some boss-killing on Floor 27. They want to do something crazy - killing the boss with only 7 people instead of the usual 49. Sounds insane right? But nope, in the end, it seems quite possible to clear with just 7 people and I'm left wondering that if there were actually 49 people fighting that boss, whether 40 of them were just sleeping on the job.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot goes the roundabout way of introducing minor conflicts that aren't central to the story itself, things like a bigger guild spying on them, the bigger guild trying to take advantage by blocking the entrance to the dungeon, and then casually resolving them by sending Kirito and Klein to the scene. None of these were needed, and they were basically auto-solved, Asuna and the Sleeping Knight's guild just needed to beat the boss, which they finally did.\\n\\n\r\nBut then again, beating the boss and getting their names written on the Swordsman's Memorial (aka Hall of Fame) was not actually the central part to the story at all, so I have no idea why the anime spent so much time on that. After the battle, we start to get the hint, because everyone's so secretive and suspicious and such, that something's not entirely alright with Yuuki and the Sleeping Knights. It's also absurd that when Yuuki bailed out on a curious Asuna by logging off, Siune, who went to apologize to Asuna, also suddenly bailed out at the convenient moment also by logging off. That's rude, and if Siune was going to bail out anyway, why bother approaching Asuna in the first place?\\n\\n\r\nThe first clue is the fact that Yuuki keeps saying that the guild will disband in the spring, the second clue is the fact that they insist Asuna shouldn't try joining them, and the third clue is in the name of the guild \"Sleeping Knights.\" What do you think? I got it pretty much immediately. Sleeping Knights basically suggests people who are fighting, but in a comatose state, hence, fighting some kind of disease. And the clues that they may disband automatically point to one thing - that one or more members of the guild have some serious medical condition, which may render them either dead in the coming few months.  And guess what, I was pretty much right - so absolutely no points for plot twist there, because I totally saw it coming.\\n\\n\r\nBut still, I actually liked how they shifted the plot from just a \"fighting bosses\" story to one that talks about life, death, about people with debilitating diseases using a virtual game to experience freedom and find greater meaning in their lives. I thought that it was actually pretty wonderful and touching that Asuna went to personally visit Yuuki in her special Medicuboid ward and made all the effort to help her live that virtual life to the fullest before she passed away. (+1 for gripping story)\\n\\n\r\nOne thing they never really explained at all though, was how did Kirito even managed to get hold of Yuuki's location in the first place. While it might have been simple to find out Medicuboid's users, no explanation is given for how Kirito even found out that Yuuki was in that kind of state and using that sort of medical equipment in the first place. This is a key plot hole they completely overlooked.\\n\\n\r\nBesides the main plot, there was a side-story running across Mothers' Rosario (also the name of Yuuki's special sword skill) of the argument between Asuna and her mother about her future and career. Asuna eventually managed to convince her mother not to transfer out of school, by showing her mother how wonderful the virtual world she was playing really was. I thought it was quite beautiful how the conflict was finally resolved, and the arc title signified not only Yuuki's mother's prayers for her, but also Asuna's mother's wishes and dreams for her daughter. (+1 for depth)\\n\\n\r\nAs such, the third arc actually ends on a rather touching note, though I thought that it was actually a bit too long and drawn out that I got pretty bored towards the end. I thought that anime could have ended at 23, but they extended the mourning and reflective scenes all the way to another episode and I was honestly just dying for the whole anime to end if it didn't have any more proper plot to offer me. What's more, the entirety of Asuna's party came over to see Yuuki's last moments in Alfheim, but there's absolutely no reason they should even bother with this person they don't even know.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end, there was also supposed to be some final twist about the developer of the Medicuboid, apparently someone that Kirito knows. But the audience can't remember all these useless supporting characters from the past, and the anime doesn't even bother to explain it's significance so honestly, why the heck did they even bother putting it in at the last second? It was confusing, pointless and a complete fail attempt.\\n\\n\r\nHence, the overall plot suffers from a lack of an overarching conflict across all 3 arcs, and it's only particularly great plot was the first one. It had 1 completely pointless arc in the middle, but ultimately ends on a happy note in the last arc, which had slightly more depth than the first two. The plot is also quite incoherent with key plot holes all about as mentioned above but I guess I have to award at least 1 point in that the main key plot lines are mostly coherent and none of the plot holes detract from the plot by much. (+1 for believable assumptions).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOpening Sequence: 3/3\\n\r\nED Sequence: 3/3\\n\r\nAnimation: 2/2\\n\r\nAesthetics: 2/2\\n\\n\r\nSAO II really doesn't disappoint on the animation side at least. Fighting scenes are really cool, with lots of different colours, effects and all keeping up to all the quick-paced action sequences. While the action scenes were really dragged out, I thought that it was at least a joy to watch the amazing art that goes into all the sword skills and spells. Character aesthetics were also very nice and I loved the overall character design.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOP Theme: 2/2\\n\r\nED Theme: 2/2\\n\r\nOP Theme 2: 2/2\\n\r\nED Theme 2: 2/2\\n\r\nBackground Music: 2/2\\n\\n\r\nJust absolutely excellent. All of the OP and ED themes are great to listen to, I would deliberately let them run because the themes are just so nice to listen to, and the background music also really brings out all the emotions in the anime - suspense, excitement, sadness, joy. Everything is so well intertwined, it was a beautiful audio experience.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is no one main character in the anime, as different arcs feature distinctly different main cast. Starting from the first Phantom Bullet arc though, we have Kirito, Sinon and the antagonists Red Eyed Xaxa and Shinkawa.\\n\\n\r\nKirito is the same guy as he was from SAO I, no particular change there. He continues showing off his legitimately insane sword skills even in GGO, by slicing bullets apart (including sniper shots), by dodging bullets long before seeing their prediction paths, and also, for comic effect, he pretends to be a girl, at least for the first half of the arc. (+1 for awesome sword skills) Unfortunately, his character development is one-dimensional and falls short quite a bit - and he becomes reduced to a guy who's only role is to explain to others the costs and benefits of a virtual reality, and to remind people how difficult it is to live with the fact that you are a murderer. We already know most of his backstory, and there's nothing new to him in this anime - he continues to be the overpowered hero he always was, always appearing in the third arc even though he's not even a main character there, as if he only wants to remind everybody that he's boss.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Sinon, who is honestly just as cool as Kirito, but probably a lot more annoying. She starts off really badass, proving herself to be a sniper who can even shoot her target while she is in mid-air freefall (not possible in real life, but since it's a game, I'll give it a pass and +1 for badassery along the way). But, on the contrary, outside of the game she's actually totally afraid of guns, because of the incident 5 years ago that has totally scarred her for life. Sinon fights to get stronger, to overcome her fear of guns, but more importantly, to accept the fact that she needed to kill when she did it, to protect the people close to her. Sinon doesn't accomplish this until finally, Kirito and Asuna arrange for her to meet one of the people she saved that day. (+1 for growth, +1 for awesome sniping, +1 for backstory). Sinon is probably one of the most developed characters in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, we have the stupid antagonists Shinkawa and Red Eyed Xaxa, who are basically just killers to kill out of revenge, jealously, and basically have no greater motivations than that, even though the Death Gun idea is so cool indeed. They hardly get any screen time, and when they do, nothing is said about their character or backstory. Although we know Xaxa is a Laughing Coffin member, we don't know anything about what he's actually like as a person, so I'll take it as a complete set of lousy antagonists.\\n\\n\r\nI will completely skip Caliburn arc because that was completely pointless and had no character development whatsoever. In the Mother's Rosario arc, we start to see development of the two main characters - Asuna and Yuuki.\\n\\n\r\nAsuna starts off kind of being the usual \"heroine\" figure who only ever knows how to do things that Kirito tells her to, but she ends up actually doing some stuff on her own too in the final arc. For one, she copies Kirito exactly in his battle strategy plans and she also goes to visit Yuuki in the hospital, although this is generally limited and Kirito helped her find the hospital anyway. The entire episode with her mother seemed a bit too common and typical at the beginning, but when she took matters to her own hands to show her mother the virtual world, I thought that at least that was some growth in her courage and inner strength (which honestly, I think she had lost since the Alfheim arc of SAO I). (+1 for growth in courage)\\n\\n\r\nYuuki is another very special character who basically lives almost completely within a virtual world, or \"a product of full-dive technology\" as Kirito puts it. She's a badass sword fighter with an insane 11-hit unique sword skill called Mothers' Rosario. As a terminally ill AIDS patient, Yuuki doesn't have much time to live, but she continues to fight on in her guild, as she longs to leave behind a lasting memory by carving her party's names onto the Swordsman's Memorial. Her backstory is quite limited though, we only know bits and pieces of how she first contracted the disease and how most of her family are now dead, leaving her as the lone survivor. Unfortunately, Yuuki herself, while being the cheery, happy-go-lucky type in Alfheim, doesn't managed to make much of her character pull through. She somehow gets really close to Asuna through the boss battles, but this is all very sudden and underdeveloped - the same goes for her guild and Asuna's party members.\\n\\n\r\nThis time around, I keep hearing the main characters telling each other that they are strong, and yet denying that they themselves are strog. This has happened for Kirito, Asuna, Sinon and Yuuki, they've all been told they are strong one another, and they've all denied it. And they use all the exact same lines so that by the time we hit the final arc, this \"strong\" line has already lost most of it's meaning. There is also a wide cast of supporting characters, but all of whom are not developed at all - Klein, Silica, Lisbeth, the rest of Sleeping Knight guild - are basically just interchangeable and you really won't be able to tell the difference.\\n\\n\r\nI have to specially mention Yui for just being the cutest thing in the world though. In the fairy form she's just really so adorable and her voice when it comes out of the speakers \"Papa/Mama\" really makes you like her so much more. Her role in this anime was basically two things though, to encourage Asuna and Kirito (Mama, hold Papa's hand!) as well as to randomly provide bits of information about the current plot line that nobody actually cares about. Still, Yui is just too cute :3. (+1 for overflowing cuteness)\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I thought that character development was okay, but a lot more depth could have been put into some of the main characters - especially Sinon and Yuuki, whose presence in the anime was really just overshadowed by Kirito and Asuna who did all real work. I also thought that more could have been done to bring out most of the supporting cast, who could all be lovable if all they did wasn't just chit-chatting and assisting in party battles. None of the supporting cast propelled the plot in any way, so they were basically just unfairly sidelined.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime really put a lot of emotion into it, from all the crying from Sinon, to the crying from Yuuki and Asuna, to the beautiful background music. Unfortunately, most of it was wasted because of poor relationship development especially in the last arc where Asuna only recently met the entire Sleeping Knight guild, and all of a sudden, it's like her party and the rest of Sleeping Knights had known each other for years! Still, I thought that the scene where Asuna and Kirito return to their home on Aincrad's 22nd Floor was also quite beautiful, because I remember that particular episode back in SAO I, where that cottage was really the place where their romance and love bloomed.  (+1 for emotion)\\n\\n\r\nAside from all the depressing stuff though, the action was really good a quick-paced. There were some scenes that seemed reused though - like the colourful slashing scene, seemed like it was repeated multiple times as the party fought different bosses. Still, the sword skill usage, spell usage animations were all very nice to watch and had very exciting visuals (+3 for action).\\n\\n\r\nOn the comic side, there were only a few funny scenes, though these were mainly limited to the first arc in all the scenes where Kirito was pretending to be a girl. But that particular scene with Sinon really made me laugh though. (+1 for comedy)\\n\\n\r\nPacing for this anime this time was actually pretty bad though. There were actions scenes and boss fights, like the Frost Giant and mini-boss Minotaur fights, that I thought lasted too long and had too much time spent on just random slashing and parrying. Unfortunately, most of the emotional scenes in this anime were dragged out for so long, and seemed so repetitive in the formula - crying, embracing, crying again, that I honestly got bored. (0 for pacing).\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has 3 filler episodes (+0 points), because the entirety of the second arc was admittedly just filler - and seeing as there's even one fanservice scene where Kirito unnecessarily grabs Sinon's cat tail for effect, it's definitely completely filler.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, SAO II excels in animation and sound, but other than that doesn't pull through in anything else. It has sub-par plot arcs and even worse coherence, and it lacks quite a bit of character development on both main and support characters. It also made me bored - which is honestly pretty rare for an action-based anime, but it actually did. I won't say it was a disappointment though, because I never had that high expectations for this anime anyway.",

I had a lot to say.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nSAO II is comprised of three arcs: Gun Gale Online, which takes up the first 14 episodes; Caliber, which immediately follows GGO and takes only 3 episodes and is basically filler; and Mother/Mother's Rosario, which is the last 7 episodes.\\n\r\nAll in all, I thought this season was off to a really good start with the Gun Gale Online arc, which for me was initially intriguing and suspenseful. But similarly to the first season, the show abruptly falls apart once you get to the next arc, as well as gets worse the more you think about it.\\n\\n\r\nSo we start the show with Kirito and Asuna out on a date, which for my shipper trash self is cute to see. Then the show skips a bit forward and we're introduced to the conflict: Some guy calling himself Death Gun has killed two players in a VRMMORPG called Gun Gale Online. When he shoots someone's avatar in the game, their real-life counterparts are discovered dead in their apartments. A government agent asks Kirito to convert to a GGO account and find Death Gun's real identity; the agency will handle the rest. \\n\r\nRight away there's an apparent problem. Why is the government sending a teenager to face down a murderer? I guess because he cleared SAO??? Regardless, he's still a teenager and the motive behind this doesn't make sense unless you disregard logic. But there's a lot of that in this season, so I'll let it slide because what's one more logical fallacy.\\n\r\nIt actually almost seems like the show is aware that Kirito is protected by impenetrable plot armor: \"Hey, this kid can't die. Let's pit him against a murderer since he can't lose!\" It's not as if Kirito is the first invincible character in anime though, so I'll let that one slide too.\\n\r\nThen the second episode abruptly shifts its focus to the costar of the GGO arc, a sniper named Sinon. Here we get to see a little bit of how GGO works (and how much of a stud Sinon is), as well as Sinon's backstory, which composes the third episode. Now, I'm gonna be honest. I actually really like Sinon's backstory. It's not the most realistic as far as backstories go, but it's certainly original and not something you'd expect to see.\\n\r\nIn the episode after that, Kirito finally logs into Gun Gale Online and receives his avatar, which looks like a girl. I'll admit I was very confused as to who this random girl was that was taking up so much time in the opening, but once I realized it was Kirito I thought it was pretty amusing. Although, his feminine appearance in this game is only used as a convenient plot device for a short while and is pretty much abandoned after that. What else is new.\\n\r\nAnyway, Kirito and Sinon bump into each other and he asks her to help him since he's new to this game, so she guides him to a gun shop. Long story short, Kirito (amazingly) is really good at this game and wins money to buy pretty much any gun. And, of course, he goes with a sword. It's a beam sword like a lightsaber, but a sword nonetheless. Not that there's anything wrong with choosing a weapon you know well, and with a tournament that Death Gun will undoubtedly appear at drawing near (and therefore not much time to practice), but it still would have been nice to see Kirito branching out a little, since after all this game IS called Gun Gale Online.\\n\r\nFast forwarding a bit more, Kirito and Sinon enter the annual GGO tournament, called Bullet of Bullets. Here the show starts to fall apart. In the midst of the final round, Kirito and Sinon shelter in a cave, invisible from the scanner that tracks players, and Kirito tells her that he is here to find Death Gun's real life identity to prevent him from killing anyone else. Then follows a very long discussion that if I recall correctly takes up two or three episodes and was pretty boring to sit through. Kirito reveals his suspicions that Death Gun is an SAO survivor and talks about killing two people in SAO himself (which came out of nowhere and relied on repeated use of flashbacks to establish that this did, in fact, happen in the first season but we didn't hear about it until now because it was conveniently added). He says he has been affected by this experience, but it rather backfires since (a) they never mentioned these two people he killed until just now, and (b) this never actually affects him in this game. It's almost like they put it there as another convenient plot device and to create sympathy toward Sinon (\"I know how you feel, I've been there too\"). Oh wait, it was a convenient plot device. These episodes were important to furthering the plot, but I still think the large amount of dialogue was boring and not logical since they're in the middle of a tournament and have stopped to spend nearly an hour just talking. Which they could probably have done before the tournament even started. But whatever.\\n\r\nAlso included in this very long conversation is Sinon's backstory, and discussion of how Death Gun could be pulling off his murders. Kirito and Sinon figure this out, brainiacs that they are, and come up with a plan to defeat Death Gun in the tournament before he kills anyone else. This, of course, works, and despite external circumstances (which I will avoid discussing due to spoilers), all seems well. The resolution of BoB made me laugh (because it was funny, not because it was bad), but things pretty much go to hell after that. Spoilery stuff happens, and basically Kirito miraculously saves the day. There was a lot of screaming, distorted facial expressions, and Kirito being a dork: the whole nine yards. Then we finally reach an epilogue of sorts, Sinon meets Kirito's gang of disposable female characters irl (plus Klein and that other guy whose name I can't bother to remember), things happen, tearful moments ensue, and character arcs come to conclusion. And it seems like an ending. So is the show over now? Unfortunately, no.\\n\r\nI honestly think if they had cut back on the dialogue in those episodes I previously discussed, and gone more in depth into GGO since it was an interesting concept, they could have ended this as a 12- or 13-episode season and had a nice conclusion. The show probably would have earned a higher score from me, too. But nope, same as with SAO, they had to drag it through the mud for a further ten episodes.\\n\r\nI was really worried during the first half of this show, since I wondered how GGO could possibly take up 24 episodes, and if not, what they would do after they finished the GGO arc. I was hoping this show wouldn't crash and burn like the first season, but it was too late for that.\\n\r\nTwo weeks later, I tuned in again, extremely nervous with what they'd pull (I skipped the recap, which I'm told was a terrible recap anyway). And almost immediately I was disappointed.\\n\\n\r\n[There will be minor to major spoilers from here on out since I recommend skipping the last ten episodes anyway; if you don't want to read them then just skip to the art section]\\n\\n\r\nWe immediately start with Kirito and Suguha discussing some place they found in ALO a while back, presumably before he went to GGO. Then they log in to the game and meet up with their friends. Right away, I was cringing. There was absolutely no mention of what had happened in GGO, character development was basically negated, and everything was right back to the way it was at the beginning of the season. Except now there's a new disposable female character in Kirito's gang, and it's (you guessed it) Sinon, now with an ALO account and cat ears to boot. The supposed costar of this season? She has like three lines for the rest of the show and does only one thing that could be considered useful. And it's in the filler arc anyway, which makes its utility debatable.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I actually really like the concept of ALO itself (as a video game) and it seems like something I'd like to play. But both of the ALO arcs in SAO have been basically filler. And this time, there wasn't even an overly convenient plot device at play. It's just an abrupt 180 tone shift from fighting for your survival to a slice of life about friends playing an MMO together.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, we now move into the Caliber arc, which takes only 3 episodes and is easily forgettable and very filler (though I'm told it was basically the same way in the light novels). There's this random quest, which if Kirito and his gang don't complete, will ~delete ALO~ (the horror!). Like, honestly, what kind of programmer are you if you make a game that can generate quests that will make the game delete itself if they go unsolved? This whole arc just screams lazy writing at you and essentially accomplishes nothing except showing you how ALO is when Sinon is part of the gang. And with so many characters in this gang, Sinon is shunted off to the side and doesn't really do anything. I thought it was kinda cool to see her using a bow and arrow since sniper rifles aren't a thing in this game, but it was barely explored.\\n\r\nLong story short, the characters miraculously clear the quest and prevent ALO from deleting itself. Yaaaaay. Kirito also gains Excalibur, spelled Excaliber in this story for some sort of pun that I forgot the meaning of. As if he needs the best sword in the game though.\\n\r\nWhich brings us to the conclusion of the Caliber arc. It was really cringe-worthy and really forgettable, and only was filler between GGO and Mother's Rosario. Not gonna lie, these episodes were actually painful to watch. I was yelling in my head about every little flaw in the writing (and there were a lot) and feeling like slamming my head against the wall. But I stuck it out because in some sick way I wanted to see how much worse it could get.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now it's time for the Mother's Rosario arc, which thankfully concludes this show. I was feeling moderately relieved at the beginning of this arc since right off the bat it's clear that Asuna now gets to be the star. Which is awesome since Asuna was basically a side character in the second half of SAO, and didn't appear much in the GGO arc. And this arc wasn't half bad, but there were just too many errors to ignore. Since basically, this arc continues the slice of life about friends playing an MMO theme, except now this time there's emotional manipulation thrown into the mix.\\n\r\nAsuna hears from one of the disposable female characters in Kirito's gang about some mysterious swordsman who is offering a special 11-hit combo to the one who can defeat them in a duel. This person has even beaten Kirito, though this is marked off as Kirito being sexist and going easy since surprise this swordsman is a girl (because we have to make very sure that Kirito is still unbeatable). For some reason, Asuna decides to challenge her, and almost manages to win. But this girl decides that \"she's the one\" and grabs her and they fly up into the clouds where this mysterious girl says, \"Help us!\" We find out next episode this girl is named Yuuki and she and her guild of six members want to beat a floor boss in New Eincrad so they can get their names listed on a wall that has the floor number and the names of the people who beat it, up to a maximum of seven names. Yuuki wants to beat a boss with just her guild so they can all have their names listed, which is basically impossible since as Asuna points out they usually have seven guilds of seven members each (49 players total) to beat a boss. Now, when I first watched this I was like \"Why is it so important that they beat a floor boss and why are they all crying over this?\" As I watched more, their motive actually makes sense and so does their insane amount of determination. I'll avoid saying why due to spoilers, but once you find out who the Sleeping Knights (the name of Yuuki's guild) really are, a lot more things make sense. So if you're watching this and wondering why they're so into it, pass on judgment until you learn their true nature.\\n\r\nAlso in this arc is a conflict between Asuna and her mother, which I think had a lot of relatability for this show's target audience of high schoolers. This conflict is mentioned a few times alongside the other conflict of beating a floor boss, and finally comes to a head when Yuuki gives Asuna advice on how to deal with her mom. The resolution of this conflict isn't exactly realistic, but I still think it's a good life lesson.\\n\r\nAnyway, Asuna discovers who Yuuki really is in an episode I'll admit was pretty depressing. But as I said to a friend, sad backstories and emotional manipulation don't mean much when your last ten episodes have no prior plot relevance. Basically these last few episodes were supposed to make you cry. And honestly, you'll cry over this is if you're so attached to this guild of people whose names you can't remember that by the time you learn their story you're feeling hopelessly anguished. I'm normally a huge baby with shows, but this one didn't make me shed a tear. Sorry, better luck next time.\\n\r\nThe ending of this tragic tale I could see a mile away. And so could anyone else with half a brain, but that's what happens when you have this sort of thing in a story anyway. What I did like was how the story came full circle in the end. I thought it was nice but overdone since they're repeating what they did in the end of the first season, trying to paint a mass murderer as a morally ambiguous guy. It doesn't work, people. It's just bad writing.\\n\r\nAll in all, the Mother Rosario arc was problematic but still reasonably enjoyable for the last few episodes. There was also the plus of seeing Kirito actually lose some fights for once. But if they ever make a third season (which I hope they don't), I'm sure he'll be invincible again.\\n\\n\r\nScore for episodes 1-14: 7/10 (above average and actually quite good at some times)\\n\r\nScore for episodes 15-24: 4/10 (below average with more bad stuff than good)\\n\r\nWhich rounds out to the 5/10 I gave it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now we FINALLY move on to the other sections, which I promise will be shorter.\\n\\n\r\n[There will be considerably less spoilers now]\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nStill very nice animation going on. It's fluid with some really nice scenery shots in ALO. I also really liked how they used a dull color palette for GGO which reflects the level on which the game is being taken seriously, contrasted with the bright colors of ALO. One of the best-animated scenes was the duel between Yuuki and Asuna, which actually had me impressed even though my enjoyment levels were at an all-time low at that point. Another point of really good animation was the first ED sequence, which had a soft coloring technique, triangles in various shades of blue and green, and some really fluid animations of Sinon dancing like a ballerina. Actually, all the OP's and ED's were really well animated, but this was the one that stood out to me.\\n\r\nThe reason this isn't getting a 10 is because of the overly distorted facial expressions (again), as well as blatant anatomical errors. And no, I'm not talking about the eyes being larger than normal. What I mean by anatomical errors is that Sinon's ass clearly shows from the top of her short shorts in GGO. I don't think these people have ever looked at short shorts, because realistically your butt is not so high up that it'll poke out from the top of your shorts. This may sound like I'm being picky, but I'm really not since the animators also make it a point to have as many butt shots of Sinon as they can. Anyway, enough of that.\\n\r\nOne last issue I have is that everyone's ALO avatars are basically the same-looking as their real world selves, with the exception of Suguha because that was a convenient plot point. Like yeah okay maybe these people want to look the same in the game but the animators could at least be a little more creative in designing the characters' avatars.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe OST certainly isn't epic tier, but it's still pretty darn good. And in terms of using the OST well, it does okay in some parts and really well in others.\\n\r\nAs for openings and endings, there are two openings and three endings (one ED for each arc), and I'll go more in depth in the next paragraphs.\\n\r\nThe first OP, Ignite, is definitely a jam and one of my favorite anime openings. Performed by Eir Aoi, who also did the first Kill la Kill OP, it's just all around an awesome song and never failed to get me pumped up for the episode. Seriously, I wonder how Eir Aoi was able to hit those high notes so flawlessly. If you haven't heard the first OP, I'd definitely look it up. Even if you don't like the show you should still appreciate good music.\\n\r\nThe second OP is called Courage, and it's still pretty good though it has more of a mild flavor than the first. I don't think it's anything super special, but that might be because I associate it with the negative emotions I felt in the second half.\\n\r\nThe first ED is called Startear (Star tear? Start ear???) and is performed by Haruna Luna. It's a really melancholic song and I like it a lot.\\n\r\nThe second ED was only played in three episodes, so I have zero memory of it, except that it was performed by LiSA (I'm pretty sure anyway). The sequence was a bunch of stills of Kirito's gang having fun adventures in ALO, so it didn't really add anything to that since I'm not a huge fan of stills.\\n\r\nThe third ED is also really good. It's another LiSA song and carries a nostalgic mood to it. The sequence set to it was another softly colored one of Asuna pressing play on all these happy memories she has recorded on her phone, and I think it goes really well with the song.\\n\\n\r\nOn the voice acting end, I thought all the voices were fine. Sinon's Japanese VA also voices Celty Sturluson from Durarara, who happens to be a favorite character of mine, so that's part of the reason I initially liked her.\\n\r\nOther than that, there was some weird screaming at some points, but I'm giving them some slack since that coincided with very distorted facial expressions.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nWhile there are some interesting backstories like Sinon's, there's pretty much a lack of character development except for Sinon, and that gets negated once we move into the second half anyway. As I mentioned earlier, with so many characters now in the cast, the show can't seem to keep up with having them all be well-developed and instead resorts to having one of them share the spotlight at a time.\\n\r\nThe villain of the GGO arc, Death Gun, had pretty weak motives. But I thought the reveal of who Death Gun is was well done, since it was foreshadowed and basically unexpected. I only predicted who it was because I was having one of my \"Hah, that'd be funny if\" moments and ended up being dead on.\\n\r\nAnd as I mentioned before, they attempted to give Kirito some development by saying \"Oh, by the way, Kirito's actually killed two people before. Except we only hastily added it in to this season so there's no impact from it.\" Besides, he killed those people in defense of his own life (and they were murderers too), so it's not as if he killed two people on the street or whatever. Aside from that, Kirito is still Mr. Perfect who beats everyone and solves everything. He had a couple of close calls in GGO, but it's not as if they haven't done that before. His dialogue is still bland and uninspired for the most part.\\n\r\nI actually really liked Sinon when she first appeared, because of her initial presentation as a strong female character and a good backstory to go along with it, but I eventually realized she doesn't have much of a personality. Her development is caused by Kirito and is concluded because of something Kirito does, so it's very little development on her own. And aside from her backstory, her personality is basically nonexistent and I struggle to come up with words to describe her. At the very least she doesn't fall in love with Kirito. Thank god.\\n\r\nAs for Asuna, she wasn't present much until the Mother's Rosario arc, which thankfully restored some personality to her since she went from badass female lead to generic tsundere over a few episodes in the first season. She becomes genuinely sweet and caring, though never loses her determination and stubbornness. Though I will say these episodes did make her even more of a Perfect Waifu and I shudder to think of how her otaku fans will react. I myself have a soft spot for Asuna, though I can at least acknowledge that she isn't a super strong character since so much of her character revolves around Kirito.\\n\r\nAnd with Yuuki, the first thing I have to say is that they should have been more creative with her name, since Asuna's last name is Yuuki as well. They at least make a joke about this in the show, but it's still an uncreative naming choice. Yuuki herself has an interesting backstory, but what really bothers me is that she is literally defined by it and doesn't have a personality aside from it. Ah, Sword Art Online, continuing to make the same mistakes over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nFor the first half of the show, I was actually excited for each new episode, partly because of the continued cliffhangers, and partly because I liked where it was going. However, this quickly deteriorated during the second half of the show and each episode made me angrier and angrier. My enjoyment levels rose some when I learned who Yuuki and her guild were, but it was still a drag for each new episode. I only got satisfaction because I was excited at the prospect of writing a review once the show finished and getting to tear it apart.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now for the final verdict. Drumroll please?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nAbove average, but not by much. I do score heavily on enjoyment, and as I explained earlier my enjoyment levels plummeted after episode 14.\\n\\n\r\nSo, is Sword Art Online II worth watching?\\n\r\nI'd say yes; the first 14 episodes at least. I recommend dropping it after that though, since there isn't much else unless you like Asuna.\\n\\n\r\nIt's kind of a shame since early on I was scoring this as an 8 which then dropped rapidly. I was hoping against hope that it wouldn't crash and burn, but since this is SAO it's not surprising that it did.\\n",

            "content": "Now, this season of Sword Art Online, I thoroughly enjoyed! Some stuff, yeah, okay, blah blah, we don't care. But... it was worth the watch!\r\nStory: The story for this was very good to me, especially the first arc. The first arc, which was about a sixteen year old girl, who played a game called Gun Gale Online. One question, though? Why can she hold a gun in the game, but is terrified of them in real life? Well, that's not my story to tell, but I assure you, it's a good enough to make you shake your head in understanding. \r\nLikes:This arc shows that evenif you did something horrible a long time ago, it helps to move on and not be stuck in the past. Enjoy life in the present and not what's been left behind. It gave very good morals. Ones that could help in life.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc was short, but very nice. Might make you cry in the end because it left me a little, not a lot, just a teeny bit sad. It shows that even if you knew a person for only a little while, you could come to care for them just as much as you care for your friends and family. \\n\\n\r\nI really didn't have any problems with the story at all like I did in the last season. The main female protagonist had a step up and one of the arcs was about her, so you got to know her more and she wasn't the whiny girl we had come to know at the end of the first season.\\n\\n\r\nDislikes: There wasn't anything I really disliked about this season. Everything was fine.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Like I said before, the art is decent. I've seen better and prettier art, but this season, the art did stand out a little. In a good way. :)\\n\\n\r\nSound: I enjoyed some of the music of this season. Especially the first opening which is called Ignite and is sung by Eir Aoi. You might not like it at first, but it grows on you until you start tapping your fingers on the desk and ending up knowing some of the lyrics.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The new characters had very good background stories and development. They were also likeable, too. Except for the batshit crazy ones, though... You'll know what I mean when you watch it. That is,  if you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed it so much more than the last season!\\n\\n\r\nMy overall is, though..... An 8! Two points higher than what I gave the last season! It was enjoyable. Some of the stuff you could roll your eyes at, but nevertheless, I applaud this season. You have my approval, Sword Art Online II! ;)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Sadly, as many others have already said, I wonder ... how great it would have been if the entire series relied on the relationship between Kirito and Sinon rather than the always lovely couple KiritoXAsuna? An anime that started so promising only to disappoint so hard is a rarity among rarities. Well, lets get down to business.\r\nStory - 6 The first part had its flaws ( I mean the first 14 episodes), like how Kirito was given an avatar that looks way to much like a woman. Until then the always frail Kirito was acceptable, but now its to much of a stretch. Still, theplot was interesting and it made me anxious about how its going to end. I have read previously the light novel, so I knew the plot, but I was interested in how the animation will make it better. And yes, it was better. The gun fights were awesome, the stressed Kirito was a refreshing add to the boring love story. Don't get me wrong, I really like love stories, but only if it does not damage the mood. This love story had a huge impact on the dramatic mood, way to big in my opinion. The antagonist was also a great pick because of his connections with both protagonists. The end was acceptable. If it had ended here, I would have been so happy. But well my biggest fear was that they would actually include the filler volume from the light novel in the rest of the anime, Mothers Rosario, instead of the next arc. Well, as we already know, it has happened. After the first episode, I already felt like a stepped in some deja vu. It felt like instead of taking a step further with the story we were forced to go back. Instead of seeing something new, we go back to Aincrad. I won't go in details, if you have seen SAO first season, believe me, it's mostly the same. One change is that at some point Asuna is the protagonist. \\n\r\nArt - 9, I never had something to complain when I watched SAO. The level of details was high and the movements were awesome, especially in some fights. The only draw back is how most of the characters seem like they jumped from a shoujo manga in a world of action. \\n\r\nSound - 9, SAO had always good tracks, especially the opening and the ending which were outstanding. The action themes were also well synchronized making the battles more exciting. There are a few flaws like how they are sometimes using a super dramatic song on a scene where they are just talking, but well, a small mistake.\\n\r\nCharacter - 7, Sinon was a great character. Her past had a strong connection with the present and the trauma that came from it made her sometimes lose her ability to function as a normal human being. The drama that this setting induced was awesome. Kirito was also presented as a veteran of SAO. Because of this we are given some answers about his feelings now that everything ended. What he truly feels. The antagonists weren't anything special, what impressed what was their style of fighting and also their obsession with killing. The rest .. well, sadly, the disappointment as always comes from the second part. The huge coincidence that led to a fateful meeting between Asuna and some \"old\" players only to create drama was one of the most annoying things ever. It felt like there were tons of Asuna clones everywhere.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 Half of it was great, it was something that I waited every week only to see how the story evolved and the action scenes of the dual user in the gun world. Half of it was .. well, more or less, crap.\\n\r\nOverall: 7, I can't say that I won't recommend this anime. Some may enjoy bot parts which would make this anime complete, while others would agree with me that only the first part was great. Watch it if you have not done it yet and try to enjoy it as hard as possible.",

            "content": "The sequel to the beloved Sword Art Online animated franchise which seemed to be a hit to many within the anime community may find that this particular continuation may not offer many of the same elements that the original was fond of.  SAO II offers only the new and can come as the biggest disappointment for those that are just looking for a continuation of the last season, however if you are willing to understand that life goes on, or just be accepting of new development than this may be the show for you. Anyways this is my review. \r\nStory: 5/10\r\nLet's be honest, anyonewho has seen this show can find out pretty quickly that very little story development takes place relative to the original SAO. For the first major arc of SAOII we get small continuations from the first season but as it would appear that the main focus of the devs was to provide story development for new characters rather than the story overall.  These characters would include the highly anticipated Sinon that appeared in the trailer and another by the name of Yuuki. As I will get into during the character paragraph the new characters that do provide development both character-wise and story-wise is rather limited. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the SAO sequel is very similar to that of the first and no stunning visual improvements were noticeable.  That being said the art for the first SAO was pretty good if not above average at the very least.  OP and ED animations are also greatly notable.  It does a good job of creating pleasing background images and character art, I only wish some of the 3D animation integrated was done more smoothly. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSteel on Steel, in sync voice acting, and great soundtrack.  For a title such as this it would be hard for A-1 not to have decent music and sound effects and as a result many OPs and EDs were shown throughout the duration of the anime.  This can keep you interested for the most part and very little qualms were met here.  An astonishing double Bass and piano was also very pleasing to the ears during each emotional sequence that the show had to offer. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nLike the story, the old characters were largely overlooked in development with Asuna being the exception.  This was much needed since it was mainly her relationship with Kirito that is stressed rather than her personally life as a whole.  Character development in SAO II wasn't bad at all, but if you're expecting the characters you are familiar with to be expanded then you will be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI liked to an extent, really not much comments I have about it personally.   Ask me if you want more details on how I personally felt.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\n\"Welcome to the Harem Store, where you can get the girl of your... Oh, it's you Mr. Kirito! Quick everyone, prepare the VIP package!\"\r\nOk lets be honest here: If there is anything Kirito is better at than winning MMOs without proper gear, that's winning chicks. And man does he prove that in GGO. apparently one of the former members of Laughing Coffin (PKers from SAO) is still roaming freely, going around killing people in another MMO. Since Nervegear has been decommisioned due to psychotic game developer without clear motives (sorry I still can't get over the \"I don't remember anymore\" line) KayabaAkihiko, noone can understand how the murders are carried out. So Kirito is dispatched to GGO by the goverment-glasses-guy who you swear to god has something shady going on (oops, spoilers) to find out who the killer is and prove that he is in fact killing people through the game. \\n\\n\r\nOnce inside GGO (which to be honest seems like a pretty badass post-apocalyptic setting for an mmofps), Kirito meets a highly troubled girl called Shion (who also has a real name you won't bother remembering). (Heavy spoilers) When she was younger she had apparently stopped a drug-addict by shooting him with his own gun and is ever since afraid of guns in real life, but has no problem with them... In a fully realistic first person shooter game where she is a sniper.... And kills people constantly(...) Did I mention I just resurrected Sigmund Freud? He was just grabbing a ladder and a rope and... \"NO SIGMUND! DON'T DO IT BUDDY! Oooh....\" Anyway said girl with issues who's real shy irl also has a boy who has a crush on her and deeply cares about her... And mastering all the blackness that my snow-white heritage will allow: \"Kirito ain't gonna let no nobody stealin' his mothaf$%king b\u00a3$%es!\" So... Second respectable male character? Crossed off the list for daring lay a hand on a Kirito girl + for being a psychotic murderer... But mostly the first. Honestly I'm wondering why Klein still hangs out with him. Humans can say something is beneath them only so much before bursting from jealousy.\\n\\n\r\nI won't spoil how the killings are done, or the exact ending of GGO, but I will say that the seer stupidity of the method gave me headaches. Oh and by the way: Haven't you heard of sooooo many MMO championships where you have to register IN-GAME... (as in, putting all personal data including your home address/real name)? Hey, while you're at it, why don't you also publicly announce when relatives will be out shopping and if you have a guard dog or not? By the way people, remember that your regular perfectly capable security locks are nothing compared to the super-advanced electronic ones that ANY MORON with a good electronic access can open. I mean, what's next?! Inviting the killer in the hou... (looks at Shion)... Argh... Nevermind...\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair though, the fights in GGO are actually a lot more epic than the first season's. It's much easier to imagine what an FPS VRMMO would be like than a medieval fantasy VRMMO mostly because of the camera which we're all used at, so viewers will find the world of GGO somehow more exciting than Aincrad. + Destructible enviroments and tons of explosions make this anime Michael Bay approved. It is also worth mentioning that unlike the first season of SAO, we're only focusing on one girl this time, which is actually a welcome change from Kirito's private strip club of season 1. Also an improvement is that instead of the incredibly female-populated SAO and even worse ALO, GGO is realistically full of men with no dignity regarding their animal insticts whatsoever. (It may be because in WOW I was an undead rogue, the most hated/cruel race/class combination of the game, but I always found the in-game female worshipping of my co-players incredibly annoying... And I also took it for a given after a few years.). Anyway, a pretty realistic addition to the game.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation and sound it's usual SAO standards, for the animation part a bit better, for the sound part a tiny bit worse, but very good in general. The fight scenes are epic (Oh yeah, spoilers alert: How did the final battle OF AN FPS turn into a swordfight?!). Kirito's... Kiritoness is over the charge, with his super reflexes allowing him to DODGE AND REFLECT BULLETS, and NOT once or twice. Oh and keep in mind that again he moves on to a completely different MMO than his previous one and with no gear whatsoever easily beats people way more experienced/geared than him... And in what kind of twisted moronic mmo do you have a RANDOMLY generated avatar that can even be critical at times?! Oh and Kirito is a trap now. I'm sure every doujinshi writer turned dramatically with their armchair while stroking a white cat when they heard this in their secret base(ment).\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the series, still ongoing, is about what's propably an epic quest in ALO, with Kirito and his harem + Klein trying to recover Excalibur (which we have already seen up-close btw, if you remember that's what the corporate soulless bastard from the first season had been using, and it didn't do much to what I assume was a barely-level-5 player with no gear whatsoever...).\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, in case it wasn't clear, while everything else is better than the first season (character developement, art, sound, epic fights, etc etc) the plot is by far worse. Keep in mind that managing to top off \"I don't remember anymore\" as the main villain motive in lameness is no easy feat. But all in all, very enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nGrand Review Continuation:\\n\r\nThe second half of the series is apparently also divided in 2 halves, the first being the aforementioned epic ALO quest, the second developing Asuna as a character. As rumors start floating around ALO about a supreme Sword Artist with unparallelled skill, Asuna finds herself intrigued. Said player apparently even beat Kirito (though he wasn't going all-out on her). Spoilers warning: Asuna befriends said player, who needed her help to defeat a boss along with her teammates. Meanwhile Asuna's mother is being a total corporate soulless b$%^h (aren't they all?) who wants to control Asuna's life while pressuring her more and more. That leads to Asuna almost hating her mother and escaping more and more into ALO with Yuuki (the famous new sword artist). Eventually Asuna discovers that all of Yuki's group, including her all suffer from chronical diseases, and in fact Yuuki has until spring to live. Being inspired from Yuuki's bravery Asuna finally finds the courage to forgive her mother and talk to her, restoring their relationship and making her less b$%^hy. In a final sad scene Yuki logs for one last time into ALO to give her unique sword skill to Asuna before dying, while of ALO's players gather around them to pay their respects to the greatest sword artist to ever live. To sum it up, s$%tloads of drama and life lessons to be learned here... EXCEPT:\\n\\n\r\nHave you ever played an mmo? Those of you who have, do you remember what happened the last time your guild master decided to retire and left his position open for the taking? Have you ever been a part of the Darkmoon arena event in WoW? It's a small competition that is repeated every 2 hours every day of the week, where one player can walk away with a small treasure. The skeletons usually pile up, with rogues hiding in every shadow and warlocks sucking the life out of their victims. No mercy is shown, no morals upheld, it's a total bloodbath where winner takes all. And the event is repeated every 2 hours... Can you possibly imagine what would happen in a real mmo where an ONCE IN A LIFETIME UNIQUE SKILL was up for the taking? Let a fellow undead rogue tell you: Spoiler warning: EVERYONE DIES! Hell on Earth! Omnes Reliquinte Spes in general. Friendhsips are shed, families are torn apart, the blood makes a constant stream that's flowing to the sewers, women and traps are raped, orphans cry on the streets looking for their mothers, half-rotten bodies litter every street, with worms crawling out of their flesh and rats crawling everywhere chewing on them, while the stench makes even the bravest of men back off. Attrocities of every kind are commited. After a while people forget what they started fighting for, give in to their savage animal insticts and just start killing for the fun of it, completely swallowed the madness that is greed and sadism. And you are telling me that every player in ALO just gathered up to wish Yuuki goodbye? Yeah... This rogue isn't buying it.\\n\\n\r\nCheck my profile for the link to my SAO: Broken Reality game and to leave your hateful comments below!",

            "content": "I know I may get a lot of backlash for this but let me start by saying that if this was just the first arc (GGO) the overall would have been so much better. I won't give any spoilers but I will say the second half for this season was more disappointing than the first.\r\nPlease not that most scores if not all are based off opinion. If you disagree with my opinion then that is perfectly fine.\r\nStory 7\r\nAs a whole I would say the story was alright. It's starter was incredibly weak to grab someone who hasn't watch the first season's attention but the followingwas a hell a lot better. I would give the GGO arc a 8 as it entertained me and I honestly could not wait for the next episode. The second arc however was more concentrated on bringing you on a feels trip. I have nothing against that personally but I feel if you got rid of this arc completely and put one with more action then it would have been more entertaining as a whole. The second arc to me is a 6 at most which gives the whole second to me a 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10\\n\r\nI always like the art style that they used. Very colorful, characters look well done. It looks like a anime that was made for it's time. \\n\\n\r\nSound 7 \\n\r\nThe music was alright as well. Nothing made me go in depth and look for the title for either intro's, outro's, or OST's. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8 \\n\r\nI enjoyed everyone that was in the anime as I did the first season. Each main character throughout the season had their own unique characteristics.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5\\n\r\nI honestly only enjoyed the GGO arc. The only legit reason I finished it was to mark another completed series to the collection.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6\\n\r\nThe show, as said when you click on 6, was fair. First arc was strong but I feel the second half was incredibly weak. It almost made me dread watching it. I would honestly tell someone to only watch the GGO arc and from there drop the show.",

            "content": "For some reason, I really enjoyed the first season of Sword Art Online, despite its numerous issues mostly shown throughout the second arc (which I almost hated). I found it really entertaining, and when the notice of the second season reached me, I expected it would be better than the first one...\r\nThat wasn't the case though.\r\nSTORY: 4/10\r\nIt is composed by three arcs: Gun Gale Online, Calibur, and Mother's Rosario.\r\nIn the first arc, a new game and characters are introduced, and since it's a mystery story, it's difficult not to get caught in it. The fact that someone can die in real life by playing agame accurately makes the connection between the two seasons. Even though, the two arcs (SAO and GGO) are pretty different; that softly starts to make the audience realize that this is a different season. I found this arc's plot the best one.\\n\r\nThe second arc, Calibur is three episodes long, which gives the sensation of a filling arc. The plot here is very simple and to the point, it focuses on the comedy and the friendship between the same group of characters from season one. It's very light-hearted, but it made me laugh and I enjoyed it.\\n\r\nMother's Rosario was the worst one to me. In this arc, the story leaves Kazuto aside, being Yuuki Asuna the protagonist. From this point on, she started to be one of the most annoying characters in the series. This arc has a really slower pace than the rest, and adding this to the poor story it has, it just makes it really dull and provoking. The idea of Mother's Rosario was to be an emotional, lovely and cute arc but in the end, the excess of drama and yuri-ish scenes ruined the already bad plot. The dramatic scenes in Mother's Rosario are just ridiculous, REALLY exaggerated and clich\u00e9'd (this kinda reminded me to The Fault in our Stars XD). This arc also presents new characters, and some backstory for Asuna.\\n\\n\r\nART AND SOUND: 7/10\\n\r\nThey were pretty much the same as the prequel, good animations, bright colors and a cool soundtrack. OP's and ED's were good too.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8/10\\n\r\nThis season focused much more in the character development since most of the cast was introduced in the first season. Even though there were some inconsistencies, this really came as a surprise.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 4/10\\n\r\nWhen I started watching SAO II, I was amazed by the improvements in comparison with the anger the last arc of the first season left me. I really enjoyed watching the new season's first arc, but I got more and more disappointed with the flow of the plot because of the quality drop. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 5/10\\n\r\nPlease make a good third season... ;_;",

Video game setting, killing/action, guns, and Sinon (not much Asuna T-T). Kirito seems OVERLY badass to the point where it's obvious that he has plot armor and doesn't seem as cool as he was in the original SAO.\r\nThe second half (excalibur/mother rosario). Was a bit dull.  Kirito ofc has his group of female followers, everything seems somewhat predictable, and it was honestly not that entertaining. There are a few moments where I thought \"OHHH shiiit!\" but the excitement literally just faded moments after...\r\nIt just feltlike the same old crap happening over and over: drama in video game, and Kirito being OP and having female admirers.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly there are better shows out there.

            "content": "In the year 2012, before Kill la Kill or Attack on Titan were even a thing, the world was taken by storm by a different anime.  An anime that became so incredibly well-known, that the entire anime community was divided into two parties, each waging war on each other, disproving whether this show was even to be considered \"good\".  That anime was Sword Art Online.  And so, in the year 2013, A-1 decided to create another season of this show, furthering the story that many people think is utter shit.\r\nStory (7.75/10):  The story of SAO II continues off from where wewere from the fairy dance arc.  Employed by a government agency, Kazuto Kirigaya, aka Kirito, is sent to a new virtual reality massive multiplayer online role playing game, or VRMMORPG in order to solve the mystery of these murders within the game.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story this time in SAO II's 24 episode run time is split into three arcs rather than two in the previous season, with each arc getting varying amount of screentime, each one getting a different amount than the other.  Continuing on from the story, SAO II goes further into the light novels and tells the story in the Phantom Bullet Arc, the Caliber arc, and finally, Mother's Rosario.  I was a bit apprehensive as to whether doing three arcs would be beneficial to the series due to how much story they had to tell, but honestly, I was pleasantly surprised with the results.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I personally think about SAO II's story is simply this.  It's a huge step up from what we saw in SAO, its first season.  Yes, the stories that they convey aren't perfect, and some of the surprises/mysteries that you're given are quite predictable and easy to figure out, but when you compare what this season used its runtime for to the previous season, there is definitely a big gap in quality, a good gap.  For one thing, the story through basically the entire series is actual legitimate plot.  Big shocker, I know.  The series progresses through two VRMMORPG's and has the characters that we know already interact with newcomers to the series.  \\n\\n\r\nAs a quick overview of the series with the Phantom Bullet and Mother's Rosario arc being the main arcs for this season, we have both Kazuto and Asuna, the main two characters in this series, come to terms with their both their lives and mistakes as they journey with the new companions that they meet.  Personally, I found this way of storytelling incredibly beneficial, as the show creates a decent amount of character background for these two characters, making them feel a little bit more like characters rather than the Overpowered hero and the generic Tsundere.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for flaws with this season of SAO, there were a few that were quite obvious to note.  The first being the Caliber arc placed right in between the two more important ones in this season.  The caliber arc sort of is what many people didn't like about the first season, side stories.  The caliber arc is essentially a side story in every sense of the word and honestly could've been scrapped to begin with, or maybe set as a trio of OVA's, since it took away screen time that could've been used for something better.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that the series fumbled on was introducing some character background, particularly in the Phantom Bullet arc.  When SAO II introduced character background, the show told basically the entire backstory beginning to end.  It didn't build up any real drama to what would be considered as the important backstory because they spilled everything out there without word or warning.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end though, SAO II did a good job with fixing the the SAO series in several degrees.  It tied in things from the original SAO into its story, giving it relevance and significance.  In addition, the show did provide plots and character stories that had meaningful impact rather than whatever happened last season.  Overall, the story of SAO II may not be perfect, but it was a drastic improvement from the first season, no doubt.  Still kinda pissed on that abrupt ending at the end.  Kinda killed the mood.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Great stories\\n\r\n+  Decent pacing (little rushed in some areas)\\n\r\n+  Meaningful character stories\\n\r\n-  Unneeded middle arc\\n\r\n-  Mother's Rosario needed a little bit more time.\\n\r\n-  That weird ending\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.55/10):  In the last SAO, you could sum up the characters of this show in one word, platonic.  There was really nothing significant about them at the time because there really wasn't much to talk about, seeing as how they were all one-note.  (Not to mention the forced romance)  Thankfully, this season did do its character justice by not only improving on their old ones, but giving us some new ones that are honestly, quite cool.\\n\\n\r\nUp first is our overpowered protagonist, Kazuto Kirigaya, aka Kirito.  Transitioning into this season, Kirito is in a sense, basically the exact same character as he was last season.  When entering the game known as GGO, or Gun Gale Online, Kirito displays his insane skills at playing videogames, and proceeds to whoop anyone's ass even though he's never fired a gun.  It's boring to see this particularly because he did this MANY TIMES last season, and it was kind of a big facepalm moment to see when that actually happened.  That being said though, the show gives us Kirito in a different light, as we see him try and come to terms with what he did back in the two year death game that was SAO.  This development does feel a bit forced and completely out of nowhere when telling it, but it does give him something more about him, and some traits which does some improvement onto his character.  \\n\\n\r\nThen we have Asuna Yuuki, our \"main\" female protagonist in this series.  From what we saw last season, we have a basic tsundere.  From this season, we see Asuna herself.  With her main arc being the mother's rosario arc, we can see her growth as a person when she comes to terms with her life and the troubles she has with her mother.  We can see what kind of person she actually is and how she tries to fight to have her own life.  Similar to Kirito, the problems that she's given does feel a little bit forced, as the entire backstory for the character's problems do come abrupt and are just given to you all at once.  It's not wrong for the series to do this, it just feels a bit forced is all.\\n\\n\r\nApart from these two, we have two new characters that get the main character roles.  Those two being Sinon and Yuuki, with their stories and development being told in the Phantom Bullet, and Mother's Rosario arc perspectively.  Now, without these two characters, this show would be nothing.  Literally, without these two characters, this show wouldn't have deserved the praise that I've given it.  Reason being is the fact that they both create character development for themselves as well as give development to the already existing main characters.  As for their individual characters and stories, there really leaves little to be desired.  They each fit perfectly with what arc they are placed in, and they do fit perfectly alongside the already existing characters.  That being said though, I personally would've liked to see Yuuki a little bit more, seeing as how her arc is supposedly more impactful and her thing got less time than Sinon's arc.\\n\\n\r\nFor supporting cast, the show sports the characters that we've all seen before in previous seasons.  Those characters being characters we've seen in both SAO and the Fairy dance arc involving Suguha, Silica, Liz, Agil, Klein, and a couple others that make cameos at the end.  There really isn't much to say about them, other than the fact that you get to see these characters a bit more.  There isn't any development to them, and they just serve as characters we've seen before above all else.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good improvements on main characters\\n\r\n+  Great new additions \\n\r\n+/-  Supporting cast plays little to no role\\n\r\n-   Backstories feel forced\\n\r\n-   Some characters didn't get the full development they needed\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8.08/10 and 8.88/10):  Now, if there's anything that SAO is really known for, it is its aesthetics in art and sound.  \\n\\n\r\nFor art, A-1 takes the reins again and produces once again, the very stunning and beautiful visuals that SAO is known for, giving the new world of GGO a very grungy and smoggy setting that makes that world much more different and interesting.  In addition, the series does go back to the world of ALO and SAO as well, giving us new perspectives and world areas that we as the audience have not seen before.  \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the series does boast some beautiful character designs that are both stunningly detailed, and well-made, with action scenes involving these characters being as fluid and well-done as all hell.  (I mean seriously, dat 11 hit combo though.)  However, one slight flaw that bothers me about these series is the fact that the quality of the series seems to have dipped slightly; it doesn't seem as great as before.  In addition, these season didn't have any particularly memorable moments that I could think of which made the animation really standout.  Don't get me wrong, the animation for this series is well above many others, it's just that in general, the series just wasn't as good as it could've been.\\n\\n\r\nAs for soundtrack.  Well, there's nothing else to say aside from how freaking memorable it is.  Like last season, SAO II gives us two sets of openings and endings, each with their own separate tone and flair to make them unique.  With GGO, we have Ignite and Startear as its opening and ending, which are honest to god, some very memorable tracks.  Ignite, giving off a very harsh, agonizing, and battle-like tone with Startear to compliment it by giving a depressing and hopeful sound makes this duo a good combo.  For the second half, the show sports its opening Courage, another song that gives a depressing and hopeful tone, making it what I would consider to be on par with its opening counterpart, Ignite.  That being said though, the endings for the second half didn't seem to be as memorable as I would've liked them to be.  I didn't find myself wanting to listen to them time and time again like I do with all the other SAO tracks, but they were still good tracks nonetheless, even if not as memorable.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like about SAO as well, if how the series doesn't just put effort into its opening and ending songs, but its mood fillers all around.  Several of the tracks from the original series makes it way back into SAO II such as the casual flute theme, and above all, the battle music.  Swordland (aka, the coffee, soda, coffee, pasta song), makes its proud return as well as being the main battle theme for Kirito, giving a great and empowering song to listen to while he pwns noobs.  In addition, the show boasts a new battle theme called Aerial Fight, making it the battle theme for Asuna as well as a great and very memorable track.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Great aesthetics\\n\r\n+  Fantastic soundtrack\\n\r\n-   No standout art\\n\r\n-  Art quality seemed to have dipped slightly.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (8.88/10): SAO has always been a bit of a back and forth for me.  On one hand, I love the series because of how beautiful it looks and how ear-gasm worthy the soundtrack is.  On the other, I was impartial on both its characters and how the story played out, so I was a bit worried about how this would turn out.  And honestly, I was quite surprised for the turnout.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?\\n\\n\r\nThe simple answer is yes.  It was a good recovery from the mess that was the fairy dance arc and definitely improved the series in a positive sense.  I thoroughly enjoyed the series, as it made its characters a bit more than just plot devices with bodies, as well as made me shed a few tears in the mother's rosario arc.  In addition, the show also had a central theme of virtual reality vs. actual reality, which made the show a bit more thematic than just a bunch of people clashing swords in a game.  Plus, Kirito gets a lightsaber.  A freaking lightsaber.  It even makes the lightsaber noises.  Why is that a thing?!\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nFor one thing, the series did rush a little bit in terms of story progression.  Some of the more important things in this series honestly didn't feel as significant on account of the fact that the show really didn't build enough tension in order to make the full reveal.  In addition, the show was a bit predictable at times, as the mystery of GGO was a relatively easy find as to who the culprit was.  Finally, we didn't get to see as much Yuuki as I wanted to.  She was a character that had quite a lot of significance to this series in general, and I was a bit sad as to how she only got like 8 episodes about her.  Not to mention her arc felt slightly rushed.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nIf you watched SAO at all, then watch this.  Even if you hated SAO, I would still recommend this because this really was a good step up for this series.  While not perfect, the show did try and fix the mistakes it made in the first season, many of which came in a good success.  It provided character development to both old and new characters of the series, and was quite an enjoyable experience to watch.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.89/10\\n\\n\r\nAuthor's Note:  Just because my avatar is Kirito, it is in no way shape or form mean that I am an SAO fanboy.  It's just a nice piece of art that I found, and really liked.  (Also, fucking AIDS.  T^T)",

            "content": "2 years after the phenomenal success of SAO, we have the sequel series SAO2 which doesnt actually take place in SAO for some reason. Welcome to the show where everyone loves Kirito and thats about it.\r\nThis season saw Kirito enter a brand new game called \"not Sword art Online\", new characters were introduced and i didnt really care. Lets find out why shall we? (SPOILERS) kinda.\r\nPlot: SAO2 starts with a murder mystery and sees Kirito enter Gun Gale Online. The arc is way too long. The pacing once again sucks in this season, they are in this fucking cave for about 2-3 episodes and nothinghappens and its hard to get invested into it. \\n\\n\r\nSword art Online isnt subtle at all and constantly reminds you about the first arc in Aincrad and re-using animation which kills the mystery. \\n\\n\r\nSince the arc is too long it constantly flashbacks to when Kirito fights this death guild in the first SAO and figures out that Death Gun (yeah thats his name lol) was in SAO and a member of the guild. Constanly reminding you remember this. pfft subtelty who cares about that.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is very obvious when plot devices are going to come back. For example, Sinon explains for about 10mins this money transferring and personal info and you are thinking sarcastically \"hmm they are spending so much time on this I wonder if its gonna come back later\" and sure enough it fucking does.\\n\\n\r\nGGO completely implodes on itself towards the end. Now Sword Art Online is absolutley vile in how it treats women going through sexual assault.  \\n\\n\r\nThe antagonist who imprisoned Asuna in Alfheim Online places her in chains and attempts to molest her in front of Kirito at the end of the first season so that we detest the villain but it came off as insulting.\\n\\n\r\nHere in GGO, one of Sinon's friends reveals himself to be Death gun (haha), the show goes through some stupid flashbacks from previous episodes to throw a poor wa-hey we gotcha and attempts to molest her.\\n\\n\r\nHe actually starts saying her name over and over and starts touching her without her consent. However he actually starts foaming at the mouth like a dog with rabies. \\n\\n\r\nShe just becomes a damsel in distresss to make us hate this guy so that Kirito can jump in out of nowhere and save her. This episode really insulted me personally and I was disgusted by it.\\n\\n\r\nExcalibur arc is pointless and tupid. They spend one episode throwing all this exposition at you and none of it fucking matters. Then a girl turns into Thor and its hilarious and then it ends. So stupid and boring. It wouldnt be SAO without jokes about an additional harem with Sinon now would it?\\n\\n\r\nNow Mothers Rosario, this was easily the best arc....of Sword Art Online, that doesnt make it a good arc. I like that Asuna had a connection with someone other than Kirito and actually forget about him. \\n\\n\r\nHer connection with Zekken is so refreshing and I didnt expect it since this is a harem show. However it suffers from cliche like when Zekken is dying everyone in the game comes around and sees her off which i laughed at as it was so ridiculous but it was betetr than the rest of the season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nI will just mention 2\\n\\n\r\nSinon could have been good if the show was not so overdramatic. I thought this girl would have been praised for saving a post office but then everyones frightened of her for some reason. But still Ill take any characterisation I can because this show gives me nothing.\\n\\n\r\nAsuna is ignored for msot of the season but she gets better in MR and opens up without Kirito which is amazing, for SAO of course. Except when Kirito bursts in for a deus ex machina in MR cos fuck it he is Kirito.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Pretty bland and forgettable. Landscapes are again nice\\n\\n\r\nSound: 1st op not great but the 2nd op is much less pretentios and I liked it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: SAO2 is bland, insulting, one-dimensional and boring. If you are an avid fan of SAO then you will have probably see it but for others maybe check out Mothers Rosario 18-25 as its slightly worth watching but other than that skip everything else.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'll be honest here. When SAO first premiered its anime adaption, I was still a wide-eyed novice entering the Japanese side of television . As a result, watching SAO, my second anime, made be latched onto anime from then onward. In that sense, SAO is a huge success, as it has for several years successfully captivated audiences, all who may find aspects of it to be very appealing.\r\nNow let's cut to the chase, and talk about the second season- Sword Art Online II. Is it a hit, or a miss? Improvement, or a decline? From my own observations, and my own input, here is whatI offer. I gladly will accept that others hate this anime, and other absolutely cannot let go of it out of love, but I'm here to ask for a bit of your time regarding what I have found in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7.1\\n\r\nSword Art Online II has a solid, if not great story, much like its predecessor. The series covers three stories: Gun Gale Online arc, Caliber Arc, and Mother's Rosario Arc. Gun Gale Online, the longest of the arcs, actually does a solid job of development, as the characters are slowly inserted into the story and allowed to breathe and grow before making any action, unlike the first season. The weakness' of Kawahara are still apparent, as there are instances of sudden character deductions and effects, causing for stilted changes in the story, but they are handled much better than in the first season. Caliber arc, is unfortunately the weakest. Bringing together both original SAO and ALO characters, and bring a GGO character, could have allowed for a great story to play out, where each person could alter and make significant effects on the mission on hand. Instead, an overblown quest has awkward pauses, overextended dialogue, and very overbearing and serious characters, even though they no longer are in a death game. Though it was a very short side story, I expected much more considering its popularity on the internet. The strongest arc is Mother's Rosario. By removing the super-powered Kirito, Asuna is thrust into the role, and has an amazing arc for herself. The setting of ALO is finally redeemed, as it truly shows how a VRMMO should have been, where fun and games occurred unlike any other. The seriousness of the story begins halfway through the arc, where the other female lead, Yuuki, has her true form exposed, and reasons for wanting to win with her friends so seriously. This is where this arc shines. By packing emotional moments with Asuna's character development, as well as putting the seriousness of SAO into situations other than death-games, Mother's Rosario, a single light-novel, finally shows Kawahara blossom as a writer, which fortunately continues in his writing for the Alicization Arc. The only weakness, ever so small, was Kirito's touch for knowing everything was still evident, but since he was out of the view, it didn't harm the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: 9.5\\n\r\nA-1 Pictures has done a really excellent job in the series, as it had done with the last. The animation, while very fluid and awe- inspiring at times, was also able to pack the grittier, dirties and more \"realistic\" fighting in the Gun Gale Arc. The music themes also fit well with the show, which, as far as I can tell, is often considered along with the art to be best, if not only, aspect of the series. There is little to be said for the other arcs because they occur in ALO, which itself was done well in the first season, but props to A-1 for maintaining the quality.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6.7\\n\r\nAh, characters. What a mixed bag, and perhaps the reason why SAO is considered to be terrible to many people. While I do not believe that to be the case, I do admit the series has a huge fault when it comes to them. Fortunately, in this season, the characters have all improved, for the most part. Kirito and Asuna both undergo adaption to the real world after the SAO incident, and both have a fair amount of growth. The difference is Kirito's seems more forced. He faces PTSD at the most random moments in GGO, and none in the later arcs, which I believe should have occurred in the ALO arc to even out the meh half-season it aired. Asuna, on the other hand, reveals her social and political tensions, and how VR has caused her to long for the separation from such worlds, which at one point captured her, but now is her only means of escape and resistance. In ALO and up to Mother's Rosario, Asuna loses her heroic stature and power, and becomes a damsel in distress, before ultimately becoming an at-times whiny, lovey dopey girl. This is all fixed in Mother's Rosario, where her interactions with Yuuki and the Sleeping Knights successfully shows her character change and evolution. Sinon, the GGO lead female, faces PTSD like Kirito, but instead because of a real-world incident at an early age. For her, GGO is where a stronger persona has emerged, and she hopes to become stronger in real life through GGO. Though she breaks down in front of Kirito, her character as a whole was the second most developed behind Asuna's this season. Sadly, Leafa, Klein, Agil, Silica and Lisbeth are all virtually ignored, even in the Caliber story arc, allowing for no development of proof of the strong friendship they all had with each other.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.2\\n\r\nWhile not a 9.5 like the first SAO season, which shocked many , like me, and instantly became a hit phenomenon, SAO II was and is (especially in Mother's Rosario) a fun show to watch. Regardless of how I felt about the show at times, especially during the weak scenes of writing, I was drawn to the concepts, the basic plot, ideas, VR worlds. and near-future world that were successfully shown in this season. Seeing as how Mother's Rosario is where Kawahara writing really begins to shine, the only way I feel this season could be improved is if he continues his SAO: Progressive light novels and further strengthens the stories, continuing all the way up to Alicization( which is very, very long), and, if the money and success continues, allow for a reboot of the series in vein of the Progressive series. It is my firm belief that it would fix many of my disappointments and make SAO a tolerable series to many in the future. But until then, I am very satisfied by SAO II.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.3\\n\r\nSAO II made strides in its second season, and though it failed to hit some key changes, it did position itself as a very strong sequel to the exciting, yet controversial first season. If more seasons are produced, I expect that SAO will be regarded more highly, but until fixes are made and stories are expanded, SAO II as it is now firmly stands as a very good, flawed, but high enjoyable anime. Thanks for reading all of this, if you did, and have fun with anime!",

            "content": "Some Spoilers Ensue:\r\nAs a huge fan of the first season, I went into this expecting a lot. Granted I was a little let down in part 2 of the first season, but it seemed the writers might be able to get back on track here...so SAO2 is broken up into 3 parts and I will review each separately.\r\nPart 1: GGO\r\nThis arc started off pretty cool...I thought we were going to get an awesome new villain and the same death in the game/death in real life drama from the first season. I was looking forward to Asuna and Kirito kicking some ass in a new world,but sadly, that isn't what happened. Instead, we were introduced 2 eps in, to a new character called Sinon. It was actually more like we were thrown into her life blind, but anyway, she comes in as the new lead and we get Kirito as her sidekick. That's all. None of the other characters are even relevant throughout this whole arc (and it seems to be an ongoing theme this whole season). I stuck with it and even began to like Sinon a bit, and then the big awesome reveal came: that the killer in GGO was someone from SAO. Once it hit this mark, I was hooked. Again, sadly, this didn't last long. The problem with this show has always been the pacing. In this arc especially, we deserved much more action. Especially during BoB. Instead, we got longwinded conversation episodes and weird ass shots of Shion laying on Kirito's lap though he clearly stated he's with Asuna. It was all just a mess. The reveal of who the bad guy was was also underwhelming. What was brought up as an awesome twist initially petered out quickly when you realized Death Gun was just some random from Laughing Coffin. On the plus side, there were a few parts I liked when Kirito and Sinon were first together and when she stood up for herself, but I called it that her friend was evil like 4 eps in...disappointing. 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nPart 2: Excalibur:\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most useless and boring bouts of filler episodes I've seen yet. There was no plot here. It seems like the writers just had too many episodes to fill, so they just threw together some messy world, put our characters in it, and gave them (almost) action sequences to run through. I did LOVE Tonkii though...probably the only good thing to come from this arc. Also, I hate how Kirito has become a typical harem guy...it ruins his charm IMO. 1/10.\\n\\n\r\nPart 3: Mother's Rosario:\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason why this season is getting 4/10 is for this arc. It isn't perfect by any means, but Asuna is my favorite character and I was happy we got to look into her life. This is another time where we got thrown a ton of new characters who we were supposed to care about. Again, this put old favorites on the back burner and, though this arc was sad, I was  disappointed by the end. Sure, Yukki was interesting and cool so her death was difficult, but I would have much preferred, if they were going to do a character death, kill of someone we know. It would have felt much more devastating and would have hit much harder than a new character. True, what happened to Yukki gave Asuna strength which was rewarding to see, but the interaction between her and Kirito was what I was looking for all season, and they literally skipped over it all season until and awkward moment in the last episode where he tells her he wants to be with her forever. Also, the funeral scene when they were figuring out who created the Medicuboid was horribly placed and took away from any feeling I did have at that time. Bad form. On the plus side, the scenes with Asuna and her mom and Asuna and Yukki were a good watch so I didn't hate it. 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nAs always, SAO looks gorgeous. The worlds are intricate and the character design is lovely. GGO was a little bland, but I guess it was supposed to be. Most of my favorite animated moments with in the last arc. Honestly though, the highlight, as with last season, was the sound. All the openings and endings were awesome (especially op1 and ed3). They pumped you up and it was great so bravo LiSa and Eir Aoi for dazzling us again here. The OST also is a definite highlight for this show. It worked perfectly during every scene as did the amazing voice acting. If anything else, I can't fault this show at all for it's sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nI touched on this already so I won't write too much here, but if you read my review of the first series, you would know I loved the characters a lot. I think that was the most disappointing thing this season: the fact that they didn't get a lot of screen time...even when they did, it wasn't really together which pissed me off. Everything that happened this season could have happened between these characters without introducing new ones. Having said that, Sinon and Yukki were worthwhile, if useless additions. I liked them when they were on the show, but ultimately, could have done without for a better experience. I really just wanted Kirito and Asuna together more. They were amazing in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nA disappointing and long-winded season. I'm hoping the inevitable season 3 will bring back the fun that was season 1, but I won't hold my breath. Some fun parts sprinkled throughout did not give me enough to overcome many boring and plotless episodes. Sorry guys, I'd skip it.\\n\\n\r\n4/10.",

(Most of the people who watch a lot of anime and know there stuff would understand this) \r\nSAO 2 was a let down, the 2nd arc was alright and nice to watch, but the mother rosario act wasn't that great as everyone said it was, i kinda stopped caring for the plot halfway in andthen just didn't care for the ending really. Like most animes this year, this was a let down",

Albeit having the same concept, the series wasn't able to maintain its enjoyability.\r\nTo be honest, I had high hopes for this one. With my high regards to the first season, I was expecting something better. First episodes were actually good. The concept of GGO is nice: exploiting one's weakness while unconscious. It is indeed another risk of the VMMORPG system. Also, the battles were quite good.\r\nBut that's the only good thing I saw here. A total letdown, IMO.\r\nThe pacing is rather slow. The GGO end is rather anticlimatic. The events afterGGO is rather boring. The side characters have no real relationship with the actual story (maybe it could've been less annoying if they had less appearances, or had side stories, idk really, but it's annoying).\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the first season, rather than a series of stories within the world of GGO, it became a one loooooooong chit-chat and flashbacks.\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, also presented in the show is the possibility of virtual reality in palliative care. But yeah, it seemed to lack enjoyment as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it really is a letdown.",

            "content": "Finally, my review for the second season of SAO - Sword Art Online II (Sodo Ato Onrain II), the season that left many people happy, disappointed, or just plain disgusted. \r\nSword Art Online II \r\nDirected by: Tomohiko Itou \r\nCreated by: Reki Kawahara \r\nBased on: Light Novel (Volumes 5-8)\r\nStory (7/10): The story of SAO II is developed in three separate arcs. Those being - Arc I: Phantom Bullet, Arc II: Calibur, and Arc III: Mother's Rosario. My score for the story reflects all three arcs together. Phantom Bullet was a decent arc that introduced a new character who I think is a decent side character thathas a tragic past - Asada \"Sinon\" Shino. Calibur was my least favorite arc as it did nothing but fill up time and gave me all the more reason why Kirito is a bad protagonist. Mother's Rosario was a breath of fresh air as it so far is the best arc of SAO and introduced a new character who once again also has a tragic past - Yuuki. Yuuki is excellent and you feel sad after what happens to her. However, Kirito is stupid for just mindlessly joining a new game after all the traumatic experiences he had in Aincrad, making his choice to join GGO illogical and unrealistic. That being said, the arcs were good for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10): The art is very good, just as was season 1. There is really nothing more to say than that. \\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10): The music and OST for SAO is definitely the best part of the anime itself. \\n\r\nOP 1 IGNITE by Eir Aoi (9/10) \\n\r\nOP 2 Courage by Haruko Tomatsu (9/10) \\n\r\nED 1 Startear by Luna Haruna (8/10) \\n\r\nED 2 No More Time Machine by LiSA (9/10) \\n\r\nED 3 Shirushi by LiSA (10/10) \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10): I still have many problems with Kirito as the main protagonist. Him aside, I still enjoy Asuna. Klein, Suguha, and Yuuki are my favorite characters and they are the best characters in the anime. I just wish they had more time to shine. Asada is great too. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8/10): I enjoyed the series very much despite all of its minor flaws and one major flaw. I had fun to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10): Overall, Sword Art Online II, while still having much more of the same problems as the first season did, was still very fun and entertaining to watch. I recommend the anime (both seasons) if you are new to anime but not if you are an elitist or if you want to watch the greatest anime ever. \\n",

I was so irritated why everyone in the anime was so obsessed with being \"strong\" while the story didn't make any connection at all. Now, 3 years later, I decided to watch it again since I didn't understand the anime at all. This time with a little difference; I gave up on life. Suddenly I understood their meaning of being \"strong\", it was notabout being skilled (as protagonists they are bound to be very skilled), it is about not giving up and have the courage to fight constantly against your trauma, against society impositions, against diseases, against this feeling of \"What is the point of living like this?\". This anime is not about the heroes of fairy tales, it is about the heroes of our daily real life. I doubt this anime will save me but it definitely gave me this question \"Will you give up like this?\" to push me forward a bit.",

I'll admit that I was a little disappointed in the first story arc simply because Kirito was really the only big character from SAO 1 with side appearances from Asuna and the gang, but I really did enjoy the Mother Rosario arc. For me, SAO has become about the characters that we grew attached to in SAO 1 and continuing their story. If you're looking for another \"play or die\" deal, it's not here and honestly if it were done again people would complain about that too. However, if you're looking to see what happens toour heroes after SAO 1 then give it a try.",

They did a very poor job maintaining the hype surrounding the antagonist (As if there was any to begin with). The plot was weak and predictable, never in my life have I been so accurate with my predictions. The only enjoyable part of this anime were the fighting scenes. I give the SAO franchise a thumbs up for their animation but a thumbs down for the amount of PIS they had in both SAO and SAO II. Deflecting bullets witha sword from close range is just straight up bs. Although, it doesn't beat  the japanese forcing letting a kid solve the Death gun mystery. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development - It's like the author doesn't give two F's about the other characters. Kirito needed a nerf more than boost this season. I understand he's the main character but sheesh Mr.Kawahara don't you think he overdue for a nerf. You might as well change his name to Jesus, with all the saving he's doing. \\n\\n\r\nSinnon was a meh. Her .50 cal sniper is her best feat. I have a fetish for characters that wear snipers (hehe). Her back story is boring and makes no sense. She gets anxious around guns in real life but uses one in the game (-.-). \\n\\n\r\nAsuna is still clueless as to what her role she plays in her relationship with Kirito. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: This season is better than the last. I still can't take the amount of PIS tho. Dodging sniper shot with a sword from is just too much bs for me. And shed some light on the other characters Kawahara, even fodders deserve some love.",

            "content": "I feel as though I'm getting more and more into the minority when I say I liked the first season of Sword Art Online. Sure, it definitely wasn't perfect and could've been a LOT better, but it did have a lot of nice moments, an interesting world with many different scenerios, and a very sweet romance to top the story off. But it made many easily fixable mistakes and had several flaws that had no reason to exist. For more on that see my review of the first series.\r\nSo when I planned on seeing Sword Art Online II, I was hoping for an experience similarto the one I got before, but maybe fixing some of the problems that existed in the past show.\\n\\n\r\nTo describe it really would be: very disappointing first two thirds, but the last part was surprisingly well done.\\n\\n\r\nStory (4/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe series is in three arcs, Phantom Bullet, Calibern, and Mother's Rosario. Since it comes first and takes up the most time, let's discuss Phantom Bullet first.\\n\\n\r\nIn an MMO called Gun Gale Online \\n\r\n(think Call of Duty + Valkyrie Chronicles), a player who calls himself Death Gun kills the current top dog in the rankings IRL through the game, and given his past experience with defeating the final boss in Aincrad and saving 300+ players from captivity in ALFheim, Kirito is called once again to find out how Death Gun kills and stop him. One action movie retirement cliche later, he goes into the game, meets a local player named Sinon, and the quest begins.\\n\\n\r\nOne aspect to note immediately from the first series was the pros and cons of the pacing. While the first series was all over the place in both arcs, it lead to several unexpected story directions in a multitude of different locations. In this series, Phantom Bullet's story structure is more coherent, but this also makes it very predictable. There's a tournament, a Battle Royale scenario, and then the arc ends. It's not helped by the fact that the end tournament has Kirito and new character Sinon stuck in a cave for what feels like three episodes. For the most part it goes in pretty much the way you'd expect it to, with Kirito defeating Death Gun in the final battle, so while predictable, what you see is what you get. Meaning that if you were expecting more expansion from the world of GGO in this particular series, don't get your hopes up. \\n\\n\r\nAsuna, the female lead of the first series, is basically sidelined for this arc, which is very disappointing as much of the heart of the first series is removed, and given what Kirito goes through in this arc, more of it was needed.\\n\\n\r\nFortunately, Sinon's inclusion does something to make up for that. She has a backstory that makes sense to motivate her character, a cool and collected attitude, a nice design that reminds of Yoko from Gurren Lagann \\n\r\n(even the voice is the same in the English dub), and the contrast between herself in the game and in real life does add to the theme of escapism present throughout the series. More on that later.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, Kirito is brought up to speed with her WAY too quickly. While I could buy Kirito being able to adjust quickly in ALFheim Online because that game was very similar to Sword Art Online, GGO is a very different style of game, but Kirito wins a contest no one else prior could in the game and breezes his way through the first tournament in no time once he arrives. \\n\\n\r\nThat's not the biggest problem with Kirito in this arc though. That would the backstory the arc fabricated out of nowhere in an attempt to connect him with Sinon. There seems to be an attempt to connect the two similar to Sonic and Blaze from Sonic Rush, but Sonic didn't get a fabricated backstory for it. Not only is the \"backstory\" an extremely forced way to connect the two characters, but it makes no sense as to why the Moonlight Black Cats backstory from the first season wasn't used. The audience already knows it happened, it would be a similar yet different scenario from Sinon's, and Kirito FELT like he killed them. This is even more apparent when Kirito flashes back to the event when trying to figure out who Death Gun actually is. So instead, the writer did something worse than a retcon by trying to remind us of events that never happened on screen and were never addressed in the previous series. Wow.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there is a twist involving Death Gun I liked as it reminded me of Mystery of the Batwoman, the mystery itself is probably my least favorite kind. Not when the one is extremely obvious but the character is built up (ERASED, Batman Arkham Knight), one where we had basically no idea who the one was and it was foreshadowed next to none. The reveal is very underwhelming, and the climax following the reveal is worse. They repeat something a lot of people hated about the first season, and while I didn't mind it as much there because there was gradual buildup to the event and the character, here it just comes out of nowhere to put a seemingly nice character straight into black on the moral scale.\\n\\n\r\nAt least the arc ends on a nice note with Kirito giving Sinon closure for her traumatic event through a very sweet scene. So overall, the arc was very disappointing, bland and dull compared to the more wide range of possibilities and setpieces from the first season.\\n\\n\r\nCaliburn, an arc which lasts three episodes, is mostly pretty harmless. Kirito and his friend group go on an in game sidequest to get a shiny sword, therefore making Kirito even stronger. While the \"tension\" is basically none, they were smart to let the action take center stage. All of the characters get a moment to shine, and the arc doesn't really overstay its welcome, so it's basically a time killer with action montage scenes and no real plot or character development.\\n\\n\r\nThe last arc, Mother's Rosario, is what saves the series from being outright bad though. It features Asuna, who was basically locked out in the series's first half, not feeling the same confidence she previously had in the virtual world IRL, and after meeting and battling Absolute Sword, who turns out to be a spunky girl named Yuuki, she decides to help her on her Guild's quest to make a name for themselves, and in turn, gain a sense of leadership and confidence from those in the group.\\n\\n\r\nAsuna's conflict here regarding her family issues adds another aspect to link her with Kirito in the first season, a family they felt they couldn't fit into, and it gives a reason why she was coy to jumping into Sword Art Online in the first place prior. The attempt to show escapism is clear through both her scenerio and the one for Sinon, going into the virtual world to not face their real problems and feel like different people. In turn, the difference makes their character development worth something.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the Phantom Bullet Arc forced the emotional connection between Sinon and Kirito through a sequence never shown in the Aincrad arc, the connection between Asuna and Yuuki is very deep and well-developed in my opinion. Yuuki sees a lot of her sister in Asuna, Asuna sees a strong girl in spite of her misfortune. But Yuuki herself isn\u2019t strong on the inside. So we see through the time these girls spend together a bond that builds both of them up and does a really good job of getting the viewer emotionally invested. Don't be afraid to fight for what you want, have fun while you still can, be grateful for the life you've been given, and try to approach life with a glass half full.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough some may call a dramatic twist that happens in the arc \"forced drama\" or \"forced sympathy\", I disagree on account of the fact that the connection between Asuna and Yuuki was built up prior to this twist, and the twist does provide great justification for the whole quest in itself. It's not a perfect arc, it could've had a lot more time to develop without Calibern and Kirito still has to get Asuna out of a tense situation, but overall it was surprisingly good in a season that was mostly disappointing prior to end it on a pretty note.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOne part of Sword Art Online that has been rather consistent even with the inconsistent quality of the writing is the animation. Fight scenes are very smooth looking and have special moments of Sakuga, the character designs have more polish added to them from the first season, GunGale Online looks like a game world even if the worldbuilding there wasn't very good, and it overall just looks very well done. Sure, the character designs look a bit similar to one another by their face, but they are still polished and colorful.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of SAO II is mostly comprised of remixes from the first season, with a few unique tracks here and there. The remixes of Swordland and Luminous Sword definitely add to the scenes they're played in, and Ignite is a pretty nice sounding song for the OP. She Has to Confront Her Fears is my favorite of the new tracks, while Courage is okay. So overall just okay.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe cast in the series do an okay job when they have their moments, but for the most part everything is periphery to Kirito. Characters like Leafa, Lisbeth, Yui, Silica, Klein or Agil mainly serve as Kirito's possy before doing too much else. Still, there are some nice moments in there amidst their demoted to extra status.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Kirito himself, the fabricated backstory I mentioned earlier does hurt his character in the first arc, as it did far less to shape his character than the Moonlight Black Cats story in the first series. I don't hate him for being \"wish fullfillment\" or \"self insert\", but he basically played very typical hero the whole way through with much less character development or growth period than before. Makes me wonder if Season 3 will add to that or not, as having gone through his trust period in the first series, there isn't much I can think of now left to use him for.\\n\\n\r\nSinon was a nice addition to the GGO arc as a whole to make it better than it would've been without her. She had a fairly developed character, and in spite of breaking down twice around Kirito, she still was vital for him to complete his mission in GGO. \\n\\n\r\nDeath Gun was rather disappointing though. Most of his villainy came from presence, and it's ruined by the identity and the end sequence with him. \\n\\n\r\nAsuna's development here was honestly something that made me like and understand her more, while Yuuki's earnest energy and relationship to Asuna made her likable quickly. It's just a shame Yuuki didn't have more than about 5 episodes of screentime. \\n\\n\r\nIt's also a shame that Kirito and Asuna's relationship, something that felt earned at the end of the last series, barely gets any focus period. It's either Kirito OR Asuna in this series rather than putting the two together. Their moments are cute but the lack of moving it to the next level is very disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I wouldn't say this was an awful series overall thanks to Mother's Rosario at the end, it was still a disappointing one because half the series is based on an arc filled with problems only slightly alleviated thanks to Sinon. Still, it's a series that kept me fairly engaged visually the whole way through. I have no idea what'll come out of the series next, but it'll certainly be something worth talking about for one reason or another.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (5/10)",

            "content": "I think it's safe to say that the second season of SAO is a bit weaker than the first.\r\nI believe this is largely because it diverts a little from the multi-character driven format of the first season in favour of a narrower one. \r\nMore than half of Season 2 , the first story arc, is centered almost completely on two characters, and while it allows for more development for both, it feels a bit bad to miss out on so many others.\r\nThere's also slightly more focus on the story, which some folks will like.\r\nThe remaining season however focuses more on other characters again, as ifto make up for it. That however is a mixed blessing, because there aren't enough episodes left for longer story arcs, so the overall pacing takes a bit of a hit.\\n\\n\r\nAll that said, the first story arc of S2 is still very enjoyable and the new character it introduces is great. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the ending portion of S2 has its own charm.\\n\\n\r\nI think if you liked Season 1, you'll at least be okay with Season 2, and depending on personal preference, might even enjoy it more.",

            "content": "Let's get real here. I'm reviewing this from the perspective of your average dude and I'm not going to get all philosophical about the meaning of everything that happens. If you wan't a down to earth review with realistic expectations in mind then look no further. \r\nStory: I'm giving it a 9/10 because I think it flows well. If you liked the first season then you'll like this too. If you didn't like the first season then why are you even looking at the second one? New season, new problems to deal with and I think the way that they managed to still fit intension is great. Not going to spoil anything but along the way shit gets real and tickets on the feels train are handed out which surprised me when it all turned out to not be just a gimmick but a pretty decent low blow to my hearts testes. Plots got some holes in it sure, but so does swiss cheese and that shit is delicious so who cares. In the end it's satisfying as a good anime should be.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Whole world is pleasing to the eye and the characters are well designed. Art on this series is spot on as far as I'm concerned. Maybe you disagree and think I'm stupid to which I say yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man.. 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nSound: Soundtrack is solid, characters are well voiced, and there isn't a boing sound every time a breast is in the frame. What more could you ask for? 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Characters are pleasant to watch and that's really all you need to know about them. They are all designed well, there isn't a prissy useless male main character but he also isn't a total bonehead with muscle, the girls aren't just massive tits with a body attached for the purpose of semi-realism, and there is a variety that ensures everyone will have a favorite character. you won't be getting crazy in depth character development here but that's not necessarily a bad thing. You know everything you need to and there is still story and depth to all the main characters. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 And I have no problem saying that. Anime is made for entertainment same as any other type of T.V. show and SAO II entertained me greatly. Was it perfect? No. but perfection is overrated and for me SAO II was just great to watch. There's some romance (but not a completely unrealistic harem with no conclusion on who gets picked), action (but not meathead madness where it's just fight scenes for hours on end), suspense, comedy, and even some points that really make you sad. What made both seasons of SAO so great to me is that the world created in this anime draws you in so strongly that you don't wan't to leave. The themes in the anime also have to do with our future as it could be and some of the more serious (positive and negative) effects our quest for more realistic virtual worlds are\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'm saying 9/10 because this has been one of the most enjoyable series I've watched in awhile. Sure I'm a bit easy to impress, but it's because I stay open minded going into anime and I just always remember to have fun watching it. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - Ignore the pretend critics and nitpickers, if you like fun, feels, and some decent suspense then watch this and at worst you'll think it was good and move on. However if you're basically an anime hipster that only thinks non mainstream anime that is all artsy is all that is good, then go somewhere else cause you're just going to ruin the fun.",

            "content": "The sequel to the hit series Sword Art Online, I present you to Sword Art Online II featuring new characters, new stories and some character development (OMG) but still has some faults left over.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story similar to the first series can be broken up into parts known as Arcs in which their are three this time round, firstly kicking off with the first arc of the series the Phantom Bullet Arc better known as GGO that covers the first half of the twenty four episodes; that is set after the fairy dance arc where main character Kirito has to enter another VRMMO after somerecent murders in the real world who are connected to that game known as Gun Gale Online/GGO. Now firstly the first part I will praise about this arc is that it forces the two main characters Kirito and new character Sinon the badass sniper chick to face there demons over the course of the story adding in a new type of dilemma to the story other than the you will die if you are killed which also does play some part in the story but any further is spoiler territory. In actual fact I couldn't find anything wrong with the story of the first arc as the pacing was well done and the ending was nicely wrapped up by the end, other than recap episode half way through that serves no purpose and should just be skipped especially if you marathon it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWith nothing further to say I will move onto the next arc and shortest of the three, the Caliber Arc that only takes place over a few episodes and more serves as filler between the two main arcs. It features the main cast of anime undertaking a quest in the Alfhiem Online for the mysterious sword Excalibur so Kirito and harem decide it's high time that go and fetch this sword. If I can describe this arc I would compare it to the Sword Art Online Extra Edition as the principles are the same as none of the characters are in any danger and is just I bit of a break in middle of the show, and can feel a bit boring after events of the last arc.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe final arc of series was the Mother's Rosario arc in which for change Kirito is not the main character but instead is the MC is Asuna someone with barely any screen time this series and got some much needed development. The story of this arc follows Asuna as she teams up with a mysterious guild known as the sleeping knights in attempt to clear the next floor and have name etched on the Monument of Swordsman for some unknown reason. This arc has a more dramatic and nicer tone compared to the other arcs as well as being slightly depressing later on which is a nice change from previous arcs as it slightly reminds you of the Aincrad Arc from the first SAO and is overall one of the better arcs of the series.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nNow for the characters of the series which I will break down into the primary and secondary characters; from which I will start with primary characters in which their are 4 with Kirito and Sinon who are the leads of the first arc of series in which they play their part quite well as Kirito the hero who can overcome anything and Sinon the Hoplophobia who plays virtual reality games to overcome it that fear, now while this seems a little mediocre they do get some actual development with the main development being on Sinon who has amazing development over the course of the series well until the Calibur Arc then she turns full blown harem candidate number whatever; but aside this even Kirito gets a little development which is nice as it makes his character more believable. The next two main characters are Asuna and Yuuki who are the primary focuses of the final arc of the series in which Yuuki the other new character gets some good development and has a mysterious like feeling through most of that arc which makes her quite an interesting person; and lastly their is Asuna who gets a good amount of focus in the Mother's Rosario Arc having a more flushed out character than before as well as a look into her family life but aside from that arc she rarely shows up in the first arc and has a minor role in second arc.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow for secondary characters which feature quite a large cast from the good old Kirito harem who don't appear that much but do have the most screen time during the Calibur Arc which is nice thing even it is slightly limited. But the real meat of the secondary characters are in the first and third arc so to kick things of I'll start with the first which has two interesting characters both having an mysterious like feeling throughout the arc who are Death Gun out main antagonist who I must say is a amazing one having a very dark personality and interesting identity; with the other character being Sinon's best friend Shinkawa Kyouji who becomes an interesting character as the series progresses.\\n\\n\r\nThe other more notable secondary characters in the series are members of Yuuki's guild the Sleeping Nights who don't have much screen time but still stick out as quite mysterious and all have unique personalities.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9\\n\r\nThe animation is as great as ever having much improved from the first series as the action flows better than before making some really beautiful scenes as well as backgrounds being well detailed and gorgeous. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nNow for sound which has torn me as it may sound lovely and fits some of some scenes quite perfectly it does have it's down side which is that it is the exact same soundtrack as the first series which yes is a good thing for the second and third arc as it fits them quite well but not so much for the first arc as that arc doesn't feel right with fantasy themed music over it and would have benefited more from a new soundtrack. \\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8.1\\n",

            "content": "That all folks, the sequel has ended and as expected it was just as the same as the previous season where it is a anime that is compose of 2 sequels in one, btw that's just my opinion, so sue me if I'm wrong, so here are my ratings for this anime:\r\nStory: Good 7.\r\nOk, the 14 episodes was about GGO, here Kirito was on a mission to find the mysterious \"death gun\". the plot is good until it's final arc on episode 14, because there he is this knight in shining armor who gets to rescue Shino, what's unique about GGO was is most actionand mystery that has put SAO in a different path. However, I've gave it such score since after the GGO arc, it becomes mediocre on ALO and not even the dramatic death of Yuuki is enough to convince me to give this part an 8.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nOk, since the character's illustrations were still the same whether in GGO or ALO arc, there isn't much for me to say something about it, exccept that Shino's attire in GGO that makes her look like a loli whore, dang, I really hate seeing her butt crack.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nSince there isn't much for me to say about the seiyuu's who did the voices of the characters, but I do like the opening theme in GGO.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nThe score is for the new character's that have appeared in this sequel like Shino, Yuuki and her Sleeping Knights gang.\\n\\n\r\nShino Asada, about her character.....here is a question, what do you don't do when firing a high caliber rifle such as a Hecate II?\\n\\n\r\nA. You use a 50 caliber bullet.\\n\\n\r\nB. You can use an incendiary round.\\n\\n\r\nC. You can fire it in a standing position. \\n\\n\r\nIf your answer is \"C\" then you are are a certified shooter, cu'z you never fire a big gun like a Hecate II standing up, and quite frankly I would like to punch anime director Itou, Tomohiko in the face for not doing his gun research, then again Shino Asada's character really add to this anime's enjoyment, thought it's unfortunate that after episode 14, she was reduce as a support, then again I wouldn't like her to be Asuna's competition for Kirito's affection.\\n\\n\\n\r\nYuuki and her Sleeping knights, ok thought they did provide as a good addition to the anime's drama, it was good that despite of the adventure they really put a light moment to the anime, it was also nice that in the few remaining episodes that Asuna was given an arc of her own, so her arc in ALO was another reason for my rating. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall: Fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nNow the reason for my rating was that imo SAO 2 should have just be limited to 14 episode, since the second arc was a mediocre, frankly from episode 15 onward, I've started to get bored and annoyed with the characters, also, the addition of the sleeping knights  with Asuna on the helm should've been limited as an OVA, I'm sorry if I'm bias about it, despite of the light moment in the anime, but that's just me, if you like it then you like it and that's that.     \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review may contain spoilers.\r\nAt last, after procrastinating for so long I was able to finish watching SAO II! Since the first season of SAO, I'm a fan. I've watched it several times while falling in love with Kirito all over again. Hoho. But that was in season one. Season two changed my heart a bit.\r\nLet's do this.\r\nSeason two was divided into three Arc.\r\nFirst part is about the game GGO. Kirito was hired by the government to observe and if possible uncover the truth behind the mysterious death of some players. He met Shinon, a sniper and together they worked hard to defeat the culprit.The end. Hoho. I was really bored and annoyed by Kirito\u2019s ability to make a girl fall for him just like that. With this and that happening, Shinon became a part of Kirito\u2019s harem in real life. *clap clap clap.\\n\\n\r\nThe next three Calibur episodes were okay. Another quest conquered.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so Mother\u2019s Rosario Arc came and SAO II was saved! Lol.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, it was lifesaver! It was no nonsense. I wonder what would have been if Yuuki was with Asuna and Kirito in SAO. Or maybe it was for the best that she wasn't, she has her own issues after all and the feels would be too great to handle. *sob\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, Mother\u2019s Rosario was the best in SAO II. I cried even though I've been warned. T.T Yuuki was so strong and Asuna was very supportive till the very end. Kirito\u2019s harem was set aside for bit since Yuuki was not interested in him.\\n\\n\r\nMy thoughts on SAO II were very simple.\\n\\n\r\nVirtual world is a lot real than what it seems. Especially nowadays when we rely heavily on technology to fulfill what we think we're lacking. It gives us satisfaction for things reality can\u2019t provide. I think if there is VRMMORPG I will definitely try it. Who wouldn't want a world where you can be anything you want to be?  A world where you don\u2019t need to hide your true self and follow the rules that has been set for you. Then again, maybe not. When the two worlds collide you just have to decide your reality. And besides, why choose, if you can get the best of both worlds? Lol.\\n\\n\r\nAnd oh, my love for Kirito came back when he told Asuna in the end, \u201cI don\u2019t know what the future will hold. However, Asuna, I want you to be with me forever. And I want to be with you forever.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nSince the first SAO, Kirito x Asuna shipper here. \\n\\n\r\nIt was good watch, indeed.",

            "content": "Here is my review of Sword Art Online II\r\nAbstract: After having reviewed the first set I could not review this one.\r\nWe start from the plot:\r\nThe plot is similar to the first setting in the sense that occurs in games augmented reality Full-Dive and in particular in two games: GGO and New ALO that also includes New Aincrad.\r\nI will not dwell too much about the plot to avoid spoilers.\r\nAttention from here may be spoilers.\r\nCharacters:\r\nI state that I will speak only of the new because I think it is impossible not to know Kirito and Asuna if it has come to see Sword Art Online II. So:\r\n-Sinon: a girl like that character is really interesting both as history and as a skill as it is a great sniper skills even defined infallible. As for the character as a character is very particular, we start from the fact that from small had a trauma that leads to psychological problems also in time in which there is the series that is many years forward to the time of the incident, that the will also have a desire to find the true strength that she sees in Kirito after a fight he has with him but we do not go into detail to allow even those who have not seen the series to read this review.\\n\r\n- Yuuki: a girl who has a serious health problem that is the basis of the narrative arc Mother's Rosary but even here we remain vague to allow anyone to read the review. It' s'a very strong sword fighter and will have a very strong bond with a particular character in the series.\\n\r\nConsiderations of characters:\\n\r\n- Kirito: design of Kirito of GGO I loved it as very innovative and I was also impressed by his use of the sword, which shown in a series of stunning animations gives indescribable sensations! As for its design in New ALO is fantastic, much to compete with that of Aincrad, I personally do not know between the two to choose! The new swords are truly magnificent, the Holy Sword Excalibur particularly impressed me but the Long Sword is epic! \\n\r\n- Asuna: i prefer her with orange hair in ALO But even with blue hair is very comfortable and the rapier very nice and especially also his being \"Healer\" is innovative and I like it, it adapts to his new side of the character we are shown in this second series, very different from that his strong side that shines in the first series!\\n\r\n- Sinon: look good, I liked it a lot as a female character and its contrasting character in real and in GGO makes it adorable. His skills have impressed me and it's really nice to see a sniper in souls mostly done so well as a character and a story very interesting.\\n\r\n- Yuuki: I did not like as much character but even I was disappointed, his story is very moving and tears a few tears, for those most sensitive to prepare. Moreover, its presence is things that are also connected to reality, you will understand seeing, and which are shown in a very beautiful and meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nConsideration on arcs:\\n\r\nGGO:\\n\r\nMy favorite in this series, very different from the usual with a psychological side beautiful, intriguing and painstakingly detailed with a twist that you never expect, and other small twists! The speeches are significant and interesting, do not ever get bored. The fighting shows especially Kirito Vs Death Gun, and a portion in particular makes me shudder and stunned! Definitely fantastic. The resolution is very significant and at times very moving moving!\\n\\n\r\nCaliber:\\n\r\nOnly three episodes, I was skeptical but I was very impressed especially the fighting and new skills Kirito, explained well and intriguing addition to some revenue in scene Asuna and Sinon and the beats of Klein with his behavior always unpredictable! A dose of laughter mixed with fighting beautiful and epic legends evoked in the form of souls. Very nice! Also the beautiful \"Holy Sword Excalibur\"\\n\r\nMother's Rosary:\\n\r\nVery different from all the story arcs ever presented by SAO and very moving, focused on Asuna Yuuki and often leaves the sadness in my heart but leaves a beautiful memory and above all so much emotion in addition to talk about subjects that just are treated, argued with a feel incredibly suitable to keep it from weighing too much while telling things as they really are! Beautiful and moving, if you have the tear easily as I prepared handkerchiefs!\\n\\n\r\nConclusions:\\n\r\nSequel beautiful, loved by many and very special, with character design and much improved graphics more than excellent!\\n\r\nKeeps you glued to the screen and makes you want more and new episodes and never disappoints expectations!\\n\r\nFinal rating:\\n\r\nI was torn between 9:10 as it was a 9.5 but graphically made me point to 10.\\n\r\nSo the final grade 10 and and recommended to all.",

            "content": "\"Yeah, long as my bitches love me. I can give a fuck 'bout no hater, long as my bitches love me.\" \r\nLil Wayne said it best. He essentially described Kirito in two fresh lines. This guy is the biggest pussy in the anime world, and deserves an abundance of hate. Unrealistic powers, density through the roof, idiocy game on point. Nevertheless, he must be a beast in bed or something because he is literally COVERED in bitches 24/7. One could say, [i]lil tunechi got that fire[/i]. \r\nThe only reason this anime doesn't get a one is not because of Kirito's impractical swag, but because ofSinon. This chick is a breath of fresh air, keeps the plot interesting and from being trash like season one, and this review. The audience can relate to her more realistic reactions, and charming demeanor. It's indeed interesting, however has a sense of redundancy, and you can tell the creators were playing off of the major hype season one received, as if to say,\" Remember how much you loved season one??? Ya love this one too k\". It's blatantly obvious when the plot tries to evoke emotion, and it lacks greater depth, but it's entertaining on an elementary level. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, this anime is like Drake; attempts to be deep, but we all know 90% of what he says is the dank weed talking.",

            "content": "I would understand why a lot of fans didn't like the 1st part of the 2nd season. A huge part of that was because they got rid of (or at least, simmered down) one of the few things that made Sword Art Online stand out and that is the survival theme of the series. Now the survival theme in an anime isn't very new (if you were watching anime for even at least a year before you heard about SAO, you would know what I'm talking about). But see, being trapped in this world where you can do anything (practically) because of video game logic,this creates a very interesting template for a story of unexpectancy. Sword Art Online was a chaos lingering in a Dream World (Yume Sekai *see what I did there*), Gun Gale Online was a tamed beast.\\n\\n\r\nI said \"simmered down\", \"tamed\" and \"unexpectancy\" because in SAO, everyone could be a PK-er. Just the thought that anyone (by anyone) could actually be killed in this game is enough to put you in the edge. In Gun Gale, only Death Gun could kill anyone so it downgraded  from everybody to one.\\n\\n\r\nBut that was where Gun Gale Online \"changed the name of the game\" (My last one, I swear.)\\n\\n\r\nI think it's safe to say now (after giving my unprejudiced thoughts about the show) that I hate the 1st season. It's only saving grace was it's first 3 episodes but everything prior was just *eh*. Yes, GGO was slow-paced and had very few action scenes (I mean what fist-pumping action do you expect from a story that has a sniper as one of the main protagonists?......... except for the for the 1st action scene?), but all that just so I can see a story (A FUCKING STORY, LADIES AND GENTS), not to mention A CHARACTER I CAN ROOT FOR, then that's a small price to pay (minuscule even). They provided time so that you can actually get to know these characters and they've actually included something that happened in SAO which is plus points for continuity.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the greatest decision they've ever done for the story was to not make it a love story. All the girls (except Asuna) that have been swooned by Kirito were cast aside as friends. Even in the Excalibur (?) arc they didn't drop any hints of their love for Kirito. There wasn't even a lot of time where Kirito and Asuna would be seen together. So to the guy/s who thought this was a good idea, God bless you, you magnificent bastard/s.\\n\\n\r\nYou might say that I'm forgetting something here and yeah, Mother's Rosario was great too. But for me, GGO was better, even in terms of story. As to why I appreciate Gun Gale more, we have to go back to the 1st season. See, what made a bigger impression of me on what SAO is all about is not the fact that it takes place in a video game or it's colorful, bodacious animation and art but rather how they tackle the human psyche (what little quality it may have). If you can do anything SAO-related for me to erase my memory of that rape scene from Alfheim Online arc then by all means. While the Mother's Rosario arc's tone was reminiscent of the aforementioned first 3 eps of SAO, GGO felt more like SAO (a better version might I add) to me because not only did they went to the survival theme again, but they added more by ACTUALLY GIVING THE ACTIONS OF THE BAD GUYS SOME JUSTICE. Also, a lesson that we didn't really need Mother's Rosario to repeat to understand (that whole \"We make our own world\" speech Kirito did).\\n\\n\r\nArt is also one to blame on why didn't fans like GGO. It's not because it's ugly in any way, but how it presents itself. GGO's theme was these dystopian cities where there were a lot of grays, blacks, and not many other colors\u2500completely contrasting to what Sword Art's and Alfheim's theme were (Maybe that's why they're doing Aldnoah.Zero now). A-1, just stick to magic fantasies. We like you better that way. And as I've said before, there are fewer action scenes in GGO so they weren't given a chance to flaunt out their animation (Mother's Rosario should help you out with that problem) but other than that, they have pretty much the same quality the 1st season has. Nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtracks in second seasons tend to be just the soundtrack of the first season but with some new tracks thrown in. Yuki Kajiura reprised the role of being in charge of the OSTs but alas, I still don't have a song from the OST that I would listen to (or maybe I just don't remember. My memory's vague when it comes to this shows' OST). But what shines though are, as always, the OPs and EDs. I don't think I need to say anything more about them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. This one's another lengthy one. Let me just say this: Shino Asada carried the WHOLE GGO arc. I say that with no remorse what so ever because  SHE IS THE MOST RELATABLE CHARACTER IN THE WHOLE SERIES (even extending to the first season) and for that reason, SIMPLY THE BEST. In those 14 episodes, we got to know why she plays GGO and why she wants to win the Bullet of Bullets\u2500because her life is shit. She wants to escape reality\u2500like most of us do. She wants to have a second life online\u2500like most us do. That's why she wants to win, and YOU want her to win because you see yourself in her (or at least, understand where she's coming from). This kind of character was a long time coming so it was really rewarding that I FINALLY got to see it. And as for the argument of Yuuki being a better character, well her character wasn't developed that well. Mother's Rosario's arc had more action so there wasn't enough time for her character to be known. It would've been nice if we got to see more of Yuuki's past so we can get more of her background.\\n\\n\r\nNow I got the idea that they wanted Kirito to develop character because Kirito's character is a bigger mystery than the creation of SAO. And their \"attempt\" on giving him a character was to say \"he's caring, he's brave, he will always have your back\" and 13 other lines from the book \"How to Write a 2-Dimensional Character.\" Kirto's character, sadly, did not show any progression despite it being the 2nd season (I have a feeling they're saving this for the 3rd season). They tried to link his background to Shinon's, like they have a common past, but that's just like making your friend remember a joke you've never even told him/her. His life in the real world is as perfect as his life online so it's REALLY hard to feel invested to this character. However, they decided to give Asuna some background (thank God) AND, she's kicking ass in the field again.\\n\\n\r\nSo, after all that rambling, how do I sum all this up? Is it worth the watch? If you're a fan, of course. You might be bored of the slow-pace GGO has but it's fine if you get past that. If you're not a fan, then probably not. While there are some things that they did change and add, it's not that big to keep you interested and that's probably for the best. Changing too much would make them lose some of the loyal fans that were there from the start. But if you're like me who was deeply disappointed from the 1st season but still wants to see the show get better, then it's good for a look. The reason this review is so long is because the second season presents you 2 seemingly different kinds of story. It's almost as if they were experimenting on what kind of story they should do. I'm not saying you should finish watching this series but it's worth to think about.",

            "content": "Everyone on MAL gave this season a very low score.\r\nCompared to the first season, this one seems a bit jumpy. The story and plot of the first season seemed to have a very good flow. This season is almost just completely split into 3 different arcs. It doesn't have any real flow; once one arc is over, another one begins.\r\n1st Arc is the Sinon story.\r\n-Basically the same as the first season of this series.\r\n2nd Arc is the Excalibur story.\r\n-Almost completely unnecessary, just some quest that everyone does so that Kirito can get Excalibur. \r\n3rd Arc is the Yuuki story.\r\n-The crying part of the show. Literally,you'll be fighting back so many tears.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like Yuuki kinda pisses me off because her character is going to live on in the story, but characters like the girl that Kirito couldn't save in the first season and left him that message are just forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nThe most enjoyable part of this season is the Sinon Arc. Kirito and Sinon make such a cute couple. It really helps illustrate PTSD so well. The 2nd Arc feels like extra random filler that wasn't needed at all and it actually deterred me from finishing the series. I took a huge hiatus before I continued to watch at this point. The Yuuki part is really sad and it isn't bad at all, but it also feels really thrown in as well. If the whole series just focused on the first story more and left it at that, I would've probably enjoyed this a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nSide note - Why is Asuna such a loser? She could've talked to Kirito about how she felt, she felt so alone and really needed someone and he definitely would've been there for her. I'm not sure why he was left out of all of this and it actually feels really rotten.\\n\\n",

Because of this, and the fact I just finished it today compelled me to write a review about it as well, maybe giving a contrasting opinion to a lot of the others.\r\nStory: 10 \r\nThere are three distinct arcs in Sword Art Online II. Without going into too much detail, the first one was good I enjoyed it about as much as the Aincard saga in the first season. The second arc was more filler than anything else but itwas still okay. The third arc, that was the one that really got me. It was by far my favorite section of the entire Sword Art Online story so far. It gave the character that had been done the most injustice throughout the series a true chance to shine instead of being overshadowed by Kirito. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI don't really have much to say about the art, it's about the same as it was throughout the story. I did enjoy the combat scenes in the first arc.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nSeason 2 kept up SAO's tradition of having great intro and outro music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the character development that happened throughout this season.

It was exactly what the series needed after Alfheim online, which I found a bit disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion I hope I'll have helped at least a few people check out this story.

            "content": "PART ONE\r\nEPISODES 1-14\r\nFollowing my trend of watching the best anime of 2014 I find myself facing off against my old nemesis, a show that\u2019s popularity is almost as mind-boggling as figuring out the ages of the people who wrote it (my bet is fourteen!). It took a lot of work to finally get myself to sit down and watch Sword Art Online II if only because I knew it would be awful and could be spending my time watching it doing something more productive, like playing a real MMORPG. But sometimes, you do things that you\u2019re not proud of and watching SAO II may besomething I hate, but somewhere deep down inside, there\u2019s something I like that keeps me watching.\\n\\n\r\nLet me preface the following review by saying that the animation and music are excellent.\\n\\n\r\nThere, now allow me to assault you with my spoiler-ridden, overlong attack on my arch-nemesis.\\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online came out in 2012 and was pretty much the most popular anime of the time, the popularity pervading even to the present. This was because it fell into a category I call \u201ceasily accessible garbage\u201d, something that requires little thought, takes you on a ride, and appeals to everything people, in this case horny teenagers with angst issues, enjoy. Swords, boobs, butts, angst. It was all there in droves. And, seeing as SAO was so popular, it only makes sense a second season would come out that has absolutely nothing to do with the titular game (most likely because the fans would be too confused in they changed the name to something more prevalent).\\n\\n\r\nSAO II starts off exceptionally boring, plodding along for so long I nearly quit just to save my sanity. The first episode comprises of Kirito and Asuna on a date and a long discussion at a table. The date, where we should be exposed to the romantic development between our two main characters instead cements that they are the most boring main characters in anime history. The discussions they have are nothing normal teenagers would be talking about and you don\u2019t even see them kiss or anything, we just see lots of hand holding and blank stares. Which is weird since later on Silica and Liz tell us that Asuna and Kirito are making out at every opportunity.\\n\\n\r\nInserted in the middle of this episode is our exposition. People are dying playing a virtual RPG called Gun Gale Online and the government is recruiting Kirito to help them figure out what\u2019s going on from inside. Two people have died, both of heart failure.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cYou mean their hearts stopped?\u201d Kirito asks completely serious.\\n\\n\r\nYes Kirito, that\u2019s what heart failure means.\\n\\n\r\nJust one of dozens of examples of the exemplary writing of this series, which shouldn\u2019t surprise me considering the first season had the same juvenile writing (Don\u2019t fall off that balcony Asuna, that would suck!).\\n\\n\r\nThe first three episodes, as stated, are boring as hell. Nothing happens. To give you an idea of how boring the first three episodes are, I barely remember anything that happened in them, and I watched those three episodes yesterday. We\u2019re reintroduced to characters and then introduced to Sinon, a sniper in Gun Gale Online who also happens to wear very revealing clothing and have a great ass. And I\u2019m not saying that because I was focusing on it the whole show, I\u2019m only saying that because the camera was focusing on it.\\n\\n\r\nSo anyway, Kirito, in a bid to stop this villain named \u201cDeath Gun\u201d (I guess \u201cBad Guy\u201d, \u201cEvil Weapon\u201d, and \u201cKill Firearm\u201d were taken) jumps out of Alfheim Online to join Gun Gale where he\u2026immediately gets the rarest avatar in the game. Avatars are apparently randomly generated and somehow Kirito gets the one that\u2019s a male avatar that looks like a female.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, the Phantom Bullet arc doesn\u2019t have enough masturbation material to appeal to people who like this show. Asuna, Liz, and Silica are side-lined (though you do get a repeat of the Silica getting raped by a tentacle plant monster scene from Aincrad) so the creator decided it\u2019d probably be best to make sure the show doesn\u2019t lose fans because there\u2019s only a single girl to masturbate to and she\u2019s really depressing. So here\u2019s Kirito, who\u2019s a girl with a penis. And instead of being truthful about his identity with people, he uses it to get his way.\\n\\n\r\nThis is especially prevalent when he meets Sinon and she happily helps Kirito as there\u2019s a scarcity of female players in GGO. While helping him choose his weapons he does another thing that we can only expect out of the most badass unbeatable guy in gaming\u2026\\n\\n\r\nHe wins a game that nobody has been able to win. On his first try, in his first hour of playing GGO.\\n\\n\r\nSo in one episode he gets the rarest avatar and also beats an unbeatable minigame.\\n\\n\r\nI shouldn\u2019t have expected any less. Especially after the two sign up to be part of a tournament called Bullet of Bullets (again, great title there). Here there is an option to give your real life name and address in order to earn real cash. And\u2026this is where things start to get retarded.\\n\\n\r\nThe center of the Phantom Bullet Arc is a mystery of how Death Gun kills players in the real world since the headsets from SAO are not in use anymore and stopping someone\u2019s heart through a game makes no sense. But once we understand that the top players are being killed and they give away their address to win prize money, it\u2019s pretty fucking obvious that the bad guy is using that information he gets in the game to kill these people.\\n\\n\r\nThis revelation doesn\u2019t come up for another five or six episodes, which is pretty pathetic. I guess Kirito has the mystery solving skills of your average Scooby-Doo viewer.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite part of the next bit of story is when Death Gun gets involved and Kirito has no idea that the guy is Death Gun. Death Gun threatens to kill Kitiro, he wears a skull mask, and he has blazing red eyes. This guy is Death Gun Kirito!\\n\\n\r\nBut trust Kirito to take three or four more episodes to figure that one out.\\n\\n\r\nMore problems come up at this point. Death Gun has a Laughing Coffin tattoo, the symbol for the player killers in SAO which brings up an assault on Laughing Coffin\u2019s base that was never shown in the original series, essentially shoehorning in something that could\u2019ve brought with it continuity for the sake of actually having a plot here.\\n\\n\r\nEven worse is that it makes me feel like the time skips in the Aincrad arc were only there to allow the writer to toss in anything he wants to make future events work. And, on the whole, it doesn\u2019t work. You\u2019d think something that resulted in Kirito killing two people, a pretty huge thing for the character, would have come up or been mentioned earlier. But instead we\u2019re given the \u201cI suppressed the memory\u201d excuse. And later on, not even kidding, he realizes that Death Gun was a surviving member of Laughing Coffin whom Kirito fought during the assault on their base. In SAO, the guy wore a fucking skull mask with glowing red eyes. HEY KIRITO? YOU SEE DEATH GUN? THE GUY WITH A SKULL MASK AND GLOWING RED EYES? PROBABLY THAT GUY FROM SAO. I love how in the flashback, the player killer walks past Kirito and our hero says \u201cI don\u2019t want to know your name, I\u2019ll never see you again\u201d. Pfft, I see the writer\u2019s understand irony\u2026no matter how stupid that irony is.\\n\\n\r\nBack to the plot. Sinon finds out Kirito\u2019s a guy, the two are now no longer friends because he saw her avatar in its\u2019 underwear (even though her armor outfit has half her ass hanging out of her shorts and shows off her body pretty much the same). The tournament happens. The two become friends. Final fight against Death Gun. Blah blah blah.\\n\\n\r\nThe middle of portion of this arc is actually pretty decently paced and entertaining. Kirito wields a lightsaber, complete with non-copyrighted lightsaber sound effects and cuts bullets out of the air as he weaves his way toward enemies. The animation here is smooth and impressive.\\n\\n\r\nSinon is the only female character present, who, of course, is in love with Kirito. This is never explicitly stated mind you, but it\u2019s pretty obvious. And it\u2019s sad but at the same time, I feel that Sinon may be the best developed character in the series so far and one you can actually get emotionally invested in.\\n\\n\r\nIn the real world, Shino Asada shot a man to protect her mother when she was only eleven and ever since the sight of a gun makes her vomit or pass out. This could have been an effectual idea if not for the fact she\u2019s a sniper in a video game about killing people. She calls it therapy but I feel like that\u2019s as much therapy as putting a mall shooting survivor inside a mall shooting simulator as one of the shoppers. Um\u2026she\u2019s scared of guns and shooting them. She\u2019s afraid of killing. I don\u2019t see how it makes sense she can play the game as she does but a girl pointing a finger gun at her in the real world makes her nearly pass out.\\n\\n\r\nShe keeps a toy gun in her desk drawer to check to see if her PTSD has passed and\u2026well, I don\u2019t know that it works that way. The biggest question to come out of this is why she never had survivor therapy of any sort and why her mother lets her live alone with such obvious mental health issues.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, later on inside GGO, she finds solace in Kirito who killed three people in SAO and is working his way through the nightmares he never had in the Alfheim arc and never got mentioned ever before. Once again we see the piss-poor writing and plotting as the only reason for Kirito to have PTSD about those he killed was to build a bond between himself and Shino and to help her get over her mental issues.\\n\\n\r\nAround episode ten the series slows down considerably. This is during the final battle royale where Kirito and Sinon team up to take down Death Gun for good. We find out that there\u2019s someone standing in Shino\u2019s apartment with a syringe, ready to kill her after Death Gun kills her in the game because\u2026we can\u2019t just kill her without beating her in-game? Huh?\\n\\n\r\nNearly two full episodes are spent with Kirito and Sinon sitting in a cave and talking, Sinon crawling all over him and the camera being sure we see her ass.\\n\\n\r\nFinal battle, Sinon loves Kirito\u2026then things get freaky fucking weird.\\n\\n\r\nThe guy we\u2019re meant to think is in love with Shino really is\u2026so much he wants to kill her and be with her forever! Since the series went ten episodes without any of the females being raped, it\u2019s about time we get another rape scene in. Thankfully, Kirito saves the day, some complete bullshit happens when the syringe injects him full of heart-deadening fluid (but not really because there was a quarter sized suction cup left on him from the doctor\u2019s office that this guy just happened to inject the fluid onto\u2026yeah, right), and Shino is cured of her PTSD.\\n\\n\r\nSo, how\u2019s this arc fare compared to the other two? It\u2019s actually, surprisingly, not as God-awful as I expected. It\u2019s pervaded with issues from the writing to the plot to the fact Kirito is still a shitty, boring character. It\u2019s still tinged with the angst that the first season had running through it. It\u2019s paced way too slow, something you\u2019d never believe after how fast the Aincrad arc was.\\n\\n\r\nIt may be the focus is only on two characters with everyone else tossed to the sidelines. Sinon is a flawed character but the PTSD thing is unique and despite how weak she can be, she\u2019s also really strong. Just like with the other girls, Kirito winds up saving the day in the end, but she\u2019s got emotions that the series lacks otherwise. And on top of that, even flawed and weak as she may be at points, at others she can be a total badass. In that regard, she\u2019s a blend of Leafa and Asuna.\\n\\n\r\nKirito is still awful and boring and there\u2019s no emotion to be found in his PTSD. He\u2019s everyone\u2019s favorite angst machine complete with all black clothes, monotone voice, and he even rides a motorcycle now!\\n\\n\r\nSo just as Leafa saved the Alfheim arc slightly, Sinon saves this arc by injecting some emotion.\\n\\n\r\nNot good, and not really terrible either, the Phantom Bullet arc is a solid average in my book.\\n\\n\r\nPART TWO\\n\r\nEPISODES 15-26\\n\r\nWow\u2026what just happened?\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc of the second season of Sword Art Online was best reviewed from a plot standpoint, which is why I essentially reviewed it episode to episode. While it was full of issues, it was a lot more enjoyable than anything the first season produced. In other words: it didn\u2019t offend me so much as it came across as a badly written shonen-esque adventure.\\n\\n\r\nThe Mother\u2019s Rosario Arc is a much different specimen from the previous arcs of this series in that it comes across as tender and emotional, builds up Asuna while also introducing us to a depressing and decently rounded secondary lead, and never offended me in the least. It was so tame in fact, I can\u2019t even think of an excuse it used for some kind of untoward and sexually explicit shot.\\n\\n\r\nBut before I can dissect this arc, I\u2019m going to do a little bit of complaining about a completely useless side arc starting with episode fifteen. This arc concerns the fate of Alfheim Online being inextricably tied to our heroes completing a quest to obtain Excalibur. Before they can they must defeat a giant boss and revel in an attempt at being smart.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I mean by this is the \u201cI\u2019ve read a book about Norse mythology, meaning I can write all this stuff in to sound smart\u201d idea that this small arc has. And it\u2019s not particularly offensive, but it seems kind of useless in an arc that is completely useless. It\u2019s essentially a bunch of people dicking around in an MMO. The only difference is that they add this end of the world stipulation to the quest they pursue to make it seem like the arc actually matters and has some sort of implications.\\n\\n\r\niIf you want to reenact these three episodes, play Skyrim for an hour, come back, and then watch episodes eighteen on. You\u2019ve pretty much accomplished what the Excalibur Arc did. And by that I mean you accomplished nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem I have is that, toward the end, Kirito tosses Excalibur away because it\u2019s too heavy and Sinon randomly gets it from midair with a grapple arrow and hands it back to him. There\u2019s not much explanation as to why he did what he did and suddenly accepts the sword back, it just kind of happens.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue with this arc is that, since all the girls are together, everyone can hit on Kirito despite his being engaged to Asuna. And Asuna does act a little peeved but not as peeved as what you\u2019d think. Sinon especially hits on him a little too hard and he takes it in stride, obviously happy for all the attention. And Asuna takes it pretty much in stride as well.  Have boundaries not been established? Or is Asuna in an open relationship with Kirito?\\n\\n\r\nThis is an arc that doesn\u2019t need to exist, adds nothing, and I assume is meant as a segue into the next arc. The problem is that it doesn\u2019t segue characters as much as the world they\u2019re playing in. Sinon could have been left out of this section and it would be no different. She\u2019s just kind of there, and while there are interactions with her nothing feels natural. It\u2019s just another time skip story much like what the Aincrad Arc did.\\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s talk about the arc that I think will be my most remembered Sword Art arc, an arc that didn\u2019t in any way show me that Sword Art is good, but showed me that the series has potential for actual emotion.\\n\\n\r\nThe arc focuses on Asuna, which may be the greatest thing the writers could have done. Kirito is stale and no amount of screen time will develop him beyond being anything more than a 2\u00d74 clad in black. Asuna, meanwhile, has a lot of potential for development as she is one of the more interesting characters in the series. She was the badass of the first arc that devolved into a whiny damsel-in-distress. So we know that underneath that soft exterior, she can be a really cool warrior.\\n\\n\r\nIn this arc we see her home life and the stresses of being the daughter of a rich guy who sends suitors her way and a mother who believes she should be going to a better school and doesn\u2019t understand her constantly being jacked into her game. This leads Asuna to feeling like she isn\u2019t strong enough, something that isn\u2019t compelling in and of itself as this was a huge part of the Phantom Bullet Arc and is kind of annoying considering, once again, Asuna was a total badass to start.\\n\\n\r\nThe mother portion isn\u2019t that important though, it\u2019s the introduction of Yuuki inside of Alfheim. She\u2019s a silly, determined girl who has been fighting everyone who will duel her in a bid to find the best swordsman in ALO. Asuna does a good enough job that Yuuki recruits her to be the seventh member of her guild, who hopes to win a boss fight with just themselves and not the usual forty-nine players necessary. In doing this their names will be memorialized on a wall in the game\u2019s main city.\\n\\n\r\nWhile things seem pretty normal they start getting intense once we find out Yuuki has AIDS and the entire guild she heads is comprised of terminally ill teens.\\n\\n\r\nRed Band Society: The Anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis can end one of one ways: Really fucking sad.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it does. Yuuki is developed enough for you to care about her and for the slow degrade of her health to affect you badly. Especially when it affects Asuna so bad, who has become the emotional focal point of the show once again. Asuna is being developed pretty well here, showing us a side of her that is a mix between that of her badass and her more feminine. We see this in the juxtaposition between herself being a healer as well as a swordswoman and the show itself does a pretty decent job of showing how Yuuki teaches her to stand up for herself and show how strong she is to her overbearing mother.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the Phantom Bullet Arc forced the emotional connection between Sinon and Kirito through the killing of Laughing Coffin members in a sequence never shown in the Aincrad arc, the connection between Asuna and Yuuki is very deep and well-developed. Yuuki sees a lot of her sister in Asuna, Asuna sees a strong girl fighting on despite her illness. But Yuuki herself isn\u2019t strong on the inside. So we see through the time these girls spend together a bond that builds both of them up and does a really good job of getting the viewer emotionally invested.\\n\\n\r\nPeople who hate on Sword Art Online are going to ravage me for saying all of these things because these are things SAO has never gotten right, nor has any right to do well. But somehow the show does. And I can see arguments from the side that this was forced and the whole \u201cterminal guild\u201d was only added to fool people like me into thinking this show is emotional and deep.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, this show isn\u2019t deep but this arc is touching. Just because a singular arc is really well done and emotional doesn\u2019t mean the rest isn\u2019t garbage. And nowhere will I defend watching this show just to watch the seven or eight episodes comprising the Mother\u2019s Rosario Arc. But after watching nearly fifty episodes of SAO, to see the series do something like this completely out of left field, is quite spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nIt works because it gives up a lot of what the series had been doing previously. It\u2019s not a sexual fantasy. Kirito isn\u2019t the main character. There are real emotions. This was a very good arc that has its faults but I feel may be the best thing Sword Art Online has managed.\\n\\n\r\nWhat are those faults? Some bad writing that boils down to stupid questions being asked, much like the rest of the series. Instead of asking for an explanation of something the character dumbly repeats what the other person said with a questioning glance. I felt that the inclusion of Kirito being a badass at one point was only there to remind us that Kirito is a badass. And I was especially put off by the ending, a picnic that seems really happy after watching the funeral of one of the best, if not the best, character in the series. It\u2019s a weird transition. Add in the strange \u201clet\u2019s do homework in the virtual world instead of meeting up and doing it together because that\u2019d mean going outside\u201d scene and the bothersome idea of people in a game spending money for recreational eating despite that having no affect on their actual bodies and you have enough problems to puncture quite a large hole in an otherwise well-done set of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe Mother\u2019s Rosario Arc is well-done. There, I said it. One of my least favorite anime actually pulled me in and made me have feelings. Are you happy?\\n\\n\r\nSo what do I think of Sword Art Online II overall? It\u2019s a pretty big step up from the previous season. It doesn\u2019t jump around enough to be annoying, it wasn\u2019t oversexualized to an offensive point (though, don\u2019t get me wrong, it is full of pointless crotch and ass shots). The season starts really boring, picks up, and then slows down considerably. The Phantom Bullet Arc as a whole is unimpressive but better than Aincrad or Alfheim even with all the problems. The Excalibur Arc was bad and unneeded. The Mother\u2019s Rosario Arc was actually pretty good, especially given what show I was watching.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole it\u2019s inconsistent in pacing, pretty average in writing, but does a  decent job handling the new characters and giving them enough time to develop compared to the one episode given Silica and Lis (meaning you might actually give a shit about what happens). It\u2019s\u2026hard for me to talk about given the relationship I have with the franchise and my inherent hate for anything related to it. It\u2019s so plebeian in execution, so base in appeal\u2026but there\u2019s something here that I enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nNow it\u2019s time to get ostracized by all my fellow critics for not flamb\u00e9ing Sword Art Online II. But it is what it is and what it is is two-thirds of mildly entertaining, average shounen topped off with a surprisingly touching finale. Fans of the show will find a lot to love, critics a lot to hate, and me? I might actually go into Sword Art Online III with a better mindset than I went into this season with.",

            "content": "For start, I love SAO. Altho I can't tell it anymore since it have been a long time since I watched it, so I forgot most of the details other than the main storyline. I just knew that SAO actually have a second season few months ago but not that excited since people saying its not that nice compared to the first season and I don't wanna ruin my experience with SAO, so I put it on my list. I honestly happy with the finishing of the first SAO so I'm not so demanding with another sequel\r\nI just finish the first 17 Episodes of SAOII (And definitely gonna update it once I finished it, altho I am not sure if I'm gonna change my opinion with the second arc)\\n\\n\r\nSo quite identical with the SAO, SAO II split into 2 arc where I love the first arc story much more than the second arc. But! In first SAO, the second arc still have a big connection to the first arc and the thrill of romance in which Kirito fighting for Asuna was so adorable, so I would say....while in SAO II, the second arc is underwhelming, somewhat ugly. Hey wait...I really love the first arc honestly. \\n\\n\r\nLet me explain.\\n\\n\r\nI was hyped to watch SAO II and the first GGO Arc was superb. Animation, storyline, new character (Sinon is a really strong character with a strong background, and she is so to say..I can hardly decide which one I prefer..to ship Kirito with Asuna or Kirito with Sinon, but yeah my feeling toward Sinon is rather an empathy because of his tragic past, yes I ship Kirito and Asuna) Ok...sorry about that. Back to the things! Every aspect of the first arc SAO II was amazing. ED theme song really beautiful (Love those Sinon spinning spinning lol, nice artwork) In term of story, the first arc have a strong concept which is related with the previous season. I love the storyline, it swung my feeling to so many way and how Sinon develop her character is very good.\\n\r\nThe closing episode of the first arc was very good, I would say almost perfect (if actually Sinon fell in love with Kirito, confess and got shoot down by Kirito ) I can see how the story settling down anti-climax.\\n\\n\r\nBut the the second arc blow it by bits. Sinon join Kirito party just like nothing ever happen and I feel so sad and dissapointed. The story itself feels like filler arc that only tried to extend the series to the miserable point (just like any other anime with filler arcs, never been good) The animation quality not as engaging as the first arc. I don't know why is it like that. The first arc was so AMAZING, I am really entertained with the combat, camera angle, special art effect, slow motions on special battle, but it was gone in the second arc. Maybe because of ALO theme was just like that or what idk. Or maybe the production got exhausted from the first arc and 2nd arc just true fillers. Who knows.\\n\\n\r\nI still in the 17th episode and still going but slower and I got filled with other series as well...so yeah..I kinda discourage to continue the second arc story (which is sad since the first arc I binge watch it in two days)\\n\\n\r\nIn short! I love the GGO Arc story and dissapointed with the second ALO (Calibur Arc Story) But I can't help to give a high rating of 9 for SAO II since it is a waste if people doesnt watch that GGO Arc story because of the second arc drag it down.\\n\\n\r\nSo please people.....enjoy the first arc story of GGO! It is worth to watch so much!\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE:\\n\r\nSo there are actually 3! 3 arc Story in SAO II, I never expect that honestly.\\n\\n\r\nI just finished the series and I would say that the last arc 'Mother's Rosario' is awesome in a different way than any previous SAO arc. 'Calibur' arc is totally trash and doesn't have any meaningful story, while 'Mother's Rosario' have a very strong and deep story and screenwriting and it gave me a different perspective about what the whole VRMMO can do to humanity based on the story, or in other words, the author actually taking the story to the next level in blurring the reality into the virtual reality in a beautiful choice of conflict. It looks shallow about how Zekken appearing and all stuffs but strangely I have trouble holding back my tears because of the dialogue kick me on the perfect spots, like a combo 11 from Yuuki. I never expect that the story develop in a totally different way from SAO that I know....and for that I give standing applause. I love 'Mother's Rosario' and one more comment is that last ending theme song 'Shirushi' is totally killer in term of lyric which is fit in perfectly with the arc.\\n\\n\r\nIt totally broke my tears that actually with this \"If I was born only to die, then what was my purpose to be born in this world?\" Oh well....I won't give you more than that tho...try watch the series yourself and brace yourself because it will be hurt.\\n\\n\r\nIn short...'Mother's Rosario' have flipped perspective from SAO first season but have the exactly the same thing...\\n\\n\r\nIt is a fight to stay alive.\\n\\n\r\nCHEERS!",

            "content": "Spoiler Free Review\r\nTL;DR\r\n-First ~14 episodes: 4/10, with ep 13 being 6/10 only because Present Grenade.\r\n-Episodes 15-24: 8/10\r\nOverall: disappointing, but ends on a great note, with the best yet to come.\r\nSword Art Online 2 almost perfectly mirrors its first season, with first half of SAO being great, second half being pretty damn bad. SAO2 starts out abysmal, and the second half improves in every aspect.\r\nThe Gun Gale Online arc has schizophrenic pacing. There's fanservice everywhere (basically in every scene with Sinon), and it tries to portray realistic firefights that fail in absurdly laughable ways, bad cg landscape and all.\r\nThen they have the gall in taking theprotagonist Kirito from someone I mildly like, and turning him into a one-dimensional Mary Sue, complete with his trap appearance and forcing us to pay attention to him; sad, since the main point of this arc was supposed to be about the new female protagonist Sinon, and her growth as a person getting over a tragic event.\\n\r\nIt still has it's moments of decent storytelling, and after the cave scene during the tournament it finally starts going uphill, only to be spoiled by awkward bullshit after the tournament.\\n\\n\r\nSo then we transition back to happy fun times back in the fantasy setting, all the fanservice disappears (I blame this on Sinon's sudden demotion to background character, which was a shame), and we get a nice breather arc that lasts only 3 episodes. Not much to say on it, other than the fact that it's not full of cringe like the first half. It delves into the lore of the world they're in, which, based loosely off Norse mythology, is actually refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nThe Mother's Rosario arc finally sees a long-awaited return to the show's former glory, with great character development (Finally Asuna has a chance to do something other than be a complacent Waifu), and some unexpected feels at the end. Don't get me wrong, from the first episode they lay the foreshadowing on really thick, and it wasn't the actual event itself that brought the emotions out. One of the minor characters says something and it's delivered so well, so subtly that the few tears came unbidden and brought a smile on my face.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict: 5.8/10. Too many trains, not enough guns.\\n\r\n:dealwithitsunglasses:\\n\r\n-edited after 2 years because giant run-on sentence",

            "content": "Ah... Sword Art Online 2. The anime that kept me watching after it's first season, even though the first season wasn't that good but it isn't that bad either. Just some issues with it.\r\nNow just a note to everyone, this is basically my own opinion regarding on its second season of the show. Does it improve? Well personally a little, but still it had its issues. Rather than bashing around and saying its bad for no reason, I would go to simple terms of why I like the show and what were the cons about it. Once again, this is a personal opinion on itssecond season. So if anyone hates the show that's fine by me. I acknowledge that the show isn't great however it does have some good stuff.\\n\\n\r\nNow for starters, Sword Art Online 2 is a sequel for Sword Art Online 1, so if anyone has not watched the first season of its anime then I would suggest to watch it and along with the movie, even tho the movie for the most part is just a re hash or just showing the flashbacks of season 1 in terms of conversations. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nNow here's the reason why I would give the story a 6/10. Basically the story for its first half was very much progressing very slowly, giving some bit of filler into it. Although it shut me off a little bit, after a couple of the first 2 episodes I started to get interested in its story. I find the story in its first half funny along with some of its progression, however the first half pulled off something that lowered my expectations of the GGO arc. Why a 6? Basically the second half got me a little better hook into the show. It did had some switch moment where they changed the protagonist to the other protagonist which I find it done fine because then it'll give a balance between Asuna and Kirito participating in the show. Personally I like the Mother Rosario Arc, because it kind of shows off as a \"Make your dreams come true before time runs out\" and \"Spend those moments with what you want until your last breath\" because that's basically the story. Living in a life where your span shortens more, and that's something a little heart touching. Now basically this isn't the greatest story, but I sure like it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNow as I always say I love the art-style for the show. Specifically some effects and the characters designs for the new characters. It's quality of animation is not the greatest it actually downgraded a little after a while but not enough to say it's awful.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music with the anime actually flows with its show. Most of the time when it goes to a tension or a soft soundtrack, or even a vibe soundtrack that could make you continue watching the episode scenes. Now as for the Openings and Endings.\\n\\n\r\nI like both Openings and Endings, but my most favourites per category would be:\\n\\n\r\nOpening 1 Ignite\\n\r\nEnding Song Shirushi \\n\\n\r\nAs for the Voice Acting, I really don't have that many complains about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nNow here's why I would give the characters a 4/10. Because before I gave the characters a 3/10 in its first season. So why a 4/10 for this season? well... Let's say 1-2 characters of this show got development. Shinon and Yuuki from the new season. For Shinon we get from a start a girl struggling her fears, and slowly facing them until she has no fear around it. Yuuki got the development or apart of it by knowing her backstory and her wishes, and her motives of continuing living on until the end. Which personally I find these two characters my personal favourites of the show. The rest? Well... I can't say much about them. The only thing I could say is that both Kirito and Asuna got their screentime but, they're just okay (but that's because I like them but they're bland in a sense) but the rest of the cast... let's say, they're bad. That's about it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough this would sound very weird, but I enjoyed most things about the show, the only thing I would kind of wished is to improve its characters more. But even so that would probably not happen. As for the fights even though they're short or mid, I had some entertainment with it. Also the comedy in some of the scenes of the show were making me giggle, but comedy is subjective.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 6.4/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's a fair second season, not that great to be honest but for me it improved some things at least its new characters and bits of its story, but overall even though its a show that could be either hated or like it, I always find at least some enjoyment for the anime series. If you would like to watch it, then watch it. But I ain't gonna assure you you'll like it.",

            "content": "The second season of SAO was once again presented with great graphics, sound effects, and catchy theme song +/ OSTs. The season was divided to 2 major plotlines (1-15) (16-). The first plot was very intriguing and did a really good job on structuring a unique and deep personality for most characters with interesting backstories. But for the second plot (starting from episode 16), the producers decided to put all the characters that appeared before in the past season/episodes together and the characters just seemed to have lost their unique personas. Not only that, the second plot also just completely lost the intensity for theneed to achieve/save something important, which draws the audience into watching it in a roll. Instead of a intense and fun anime like it was presented in the past season and episodes, it has rendered into something like a MMORPG walkthrough with commentary. And as Kirito himself said from the first season, \"There is nothing more boring than watching another person playing an MMORPG\". If you're expecting an intense and intriguing series, this might not be the best choice for you.",

            "content": "You'd think that after losing 2 years of his life trapped in a video game, Kirito would stay away from that kind of VR technology forever. But no, apparently we have another adventure to jump into that involves an in-game player *somehow* killing people in real life when he shoots them in the game. Completely forgetting a traumatic, life-stealing experience with SAO and ignoring, once again, the possibility of losing his life, Kirito plunges into GGO for whatever reason.\r\nStory: 1\r\nI really can't go into too much detail for the sake of not releasing major spoilers, but the story is a mess. A protagonist who resemblessomeone out of a self-insert fanfic with his \"amazing skills\" as well as how popular he is with everybody. An antagonist with no clear motivation to speak of. a whole mystery aspect of the plot revolving around Death Gun's ability to kill people in real life that is so laughably implausible; something that would require the most miraculous of circumstances to even have a slim chance of being feasibly done. What's almost worse is how the protagonist, while trying to uncover this mystery, take humongous leaps and bound in assumptions based off of completely non-related pieces of information and even information he never had any way of knowing. In other words, Kirito \"magically guesses\" the mechanics of Death Gun's killing, all based off of nothing. Everyone's motivations and actions have almost no consistency, which i will cover in the character's section. Overall, every episode left me saying \"That's it?\" once the credits rolled. I can't believe this series lasts 24 episodes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 4/3\\n\\n\r\nI am lumping these two together because there really isn't much to say about either of them. The same several music tracks are routinely played in scenes of action, suspense, and emotional exposition. The art isn't bad per se, but it still retains its run-of-the-mill cookie cutter appearance from the original Sword Art Online series. Nothing worth getting excited about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1\\n\\n\r\nNone of them make any sense, nor are they relatable in any way that would compel me to care about them. Kirito apparently is fast enough to dodge bullets (those bullet lines mechanics were placed by the producers of the show to offer a cheap explanation for him dodging automatic gunfire), as well as consistently block barrages of bullets with his laser sword, yet seems to have a tough time keeping up whenever he finds himself caught in a sword fight. His emotions and personality retain nothing from his experience of losing 2 years to a video game, and every \"heartfelt\" scene of him reliving his fights against Laughing Coffin and being afraid are quickly discarded when he instantly concludes that he has to stay strong, and any semblance of character development is promptly forgotten.\\n\r\nSinon has a laughably absurd backstory involving her experience using a gun to defend herself. This manifests into a crippling fear of guns, even causing her to fold when someone makes the shape of a pistol with their fingers. Despite all of this, she routinely plays a video game filled with guns, makes that same hand gesture herself at one point, and even keep a gun carefully placed in one of her drawers for no foreseeable reason. When she first meets Kirito in-game, she has an open and friendly personality only because she thinks he's a girl (for whatever reason the producers make Kirito have long hair and a slender physique), but turns into a stock tsundere once he reveals his true gender. She whines and complains about battling him and defeating him every step of the way, yet in a moment where she has an opportunity to DO EXACTLY THAT, she \"hesitates\", or \"doesn't think the situation is appropriate\", mainly because Kirito is the MC and all the girls just HAVE to like Kirito eventually. So despite her fear of guns and her penchant for revenge against Kirito, she agrees to join him on his adventure for no good reason. Every scene of her explaining her life problems to Kirito are all back-dropped with your typical light piano music, as she complains about her past experiences while pandering to whatever nonsensical comfort Kirito can shovel out.\\n\r\nAs for Death Gun, the antagonist, I already explained that he has no clear motivation for killing people. None of his actions have any purpose behind them. He is a bland, uninteresting villain who wants to do villain stuff because he's the villain.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\\n\r\nBoring and unbelievable action scenes, boring moments of emotional expression, and boring characters trying to shuffle their way through a boring plot. It is a chore to watch an episode of Sword Art Online, let alone the entire season.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nAs if ending at the original Sword Art Online wasn't enough, we are treated with a purely nonsensical sequel that, especially in the context of past events, makes no sense whatsoever. It is clear that the developers of this series did so entirely for the sake of milking more money out of the Sword Art Online series.",

            "content": "Hallelujah!\r\nSo, if I had to give a reason for SAO to be in my top 10, it'd primarily be because of season two. It's still DEFINITELY a guilty pleasure, but this season wasn't AS bad.\r\nStory: 7\r\nActual narrative! There are three arcs this time around: Gun Gale Online (GGO), Calibur, and Mother's Rosario.\r\nGGO is actually quite well done. Death Gun is actually an intimidating villain, killing people because he can. His motivations are weak, which hurts the story category a bit, but hey, we're comparing Kayaba and the Fairy King, so I'll live.\r\nAnyway, it's up to Kirito, super spy, in his new androgynous avatar (hi-jinks ensue)to hunt down Death Gun and bring him to justice! Along the way, he meets Sinon, a sniper who don't need no man to be a BAMF. Heck, Kirito even gets.. *gasp* character development. For two episodes. Why do you do this to me, SAO? Unfortunately, they set up an interesting foil to Kirito, and waste the potential. Again, it keeps the story at a seven, instead of an eight.\\n\\n\r\nCalibur is filler. It's canon filler. Skip if you like. You're only missing explanation for a weapon reskin, and it's not like it matters. Kirito could kill a man with a plastic spoon if he wanted.\\n\\n\r\nMother's Rosario is a primarily character driven arc, and it finally gives Asuna the character growth she deserved since episode two of season one. It's quite good at making you love these arc-specific characters, and I'll admit, I did cry a little at the end. It has its issues *cough* Asuna's mother *cough*, but it was still wonderful. Heck, Kirito does something besides be the guy who always wins. Oh, Mother's Rosario, I love you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSecond verse, same as the first. It's very pretty. Moving on!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe music, especially the openings, was great this time around, though it didn't stand out quite as well to me, so I've dropped from an 8 to a 7. The voice acting is the same as well, though the English dub seems a little better this time around. Still better in Japanese, but at least my ears aren't committing seppuku.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nKirito is still awful. Asuna is still non-existent. Suguha is practically non-existent as well. Yui is a plot device.\\n\\n\r\nWhat pushes this up this time around are three major characters introduced this season.\\n\\n\r\nSinon is brilliant. I'll say it now. She suffers from what appears to be severe PTSD, and she's using a VRMMORPG to act as therapy. Since I've done research on VR anxiety therapy (fear specifically, but PTSD was in my team's research), this is a plot point I can legitimately enjoy. Plus, she grows so much in the GGO arc. Too bad she just becomes harem fodder come Calibur. Also, and here's the part where we should be upset guys, she's disrespected with some of the worst fanservice I've seen in a while. Like, her first episode: cameltoe. Don't do this to me SAO. I'm trying to like you, but you keep pushing me away.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Gun was also great. As mentioned previously, he's intimidating, but not well thought out.\\n\\n\r\nYuuki is our last character of note. She's only in Mother's Rosario, but she's so good in that short time. She's an adventurous, bubbly young girl who only wants to beat one boss alone with her friends before she must leave the RPG. I won't spoil too much, but bring tissues.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nI had more issues with this one this time around. The villain disappointed me, the art wasn't quite as entrancing, and there was FAR too much fanservice. Still, it was alright, and I did have a few moments that I laughed, or cried, or just grunted out of a sense of awesome.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nShould you watch it? Well, moreso than the first season. This one did more for the series, and I hope that any future installments follow this trend of writing improvement. I look forward to the day when I can give an SAO season a 7",

I'd fully enjoyed most of SAO season 1 but the 3 and 4s on MAL had put me off watching SAO II, something I'd say in retrospect was rather unwarranted.\r\nSure, SAO II suffers from some hollow and repetitive characters and dialogue. The plot isn't something to rave about, except the last Arc which will make the most manly human weep. Kirito remains (to many viewers, annoyingly) perfect, but again he's the main character so I personally prefer him thisway.\\n\\n\r\nSAO II delivered a strong soundtrack and animation, the Arcs were mainly engaging, the fights glued me to the screen, and I got to watch plenty of Asuna/Kirito kickass. IMHO SAO II is a good representation of why I watch anime - I disconnect from reality and dive into a whole new world. It's not terribly logical all the time, but that's anime for you, and I'm sure entertained enough. Clearly not everyone will share the same views on SAO II but I hope this review will give a more balanced opinion and help someone decide on whether to give this a go next :)\\n",

            "content": "STORY: 2/10\r\nNone of the three arcs in this season were remotely interesting or well-thought out. Gun Gale Online simply consisted of poor writing. Tried to be a mystery, ended up being a string of coincidences favouring the main character. Too many forced plot developments going on in the main characters favour. Excalibur wasn't even impactful, mostly just pandering fan service regarding the main cast's friendships. Mother's Rosario was trying to be emotional but failed hard. Hard to be emotional when the rest of the season has been one huge joke in terms of writing. \r\nART: 3/10\r\nThe production budget must have been really low this season.Several times I noticed something was off in the animation, an in between drawn correctly, or faces looking inconsistent and non-proportionate. The art was below mediocre, and I was not impressed. None of the backgrounds were eye-catching and most of the time consisted of dull colours and the characters were not drawn that well, either. Not once did I think a scene looked interesting. It felt pretty lifeless. Granted, SAO II does not have the worst are I've ever seen, and kinda gets the job done. Thus warranting a 3.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound was okay, I guess. I don't really know what to put here. Got the job done and I didn't really notice anything off. That being said, it wasn't really impressive either, so 5/10 for mediocre. Nothing bad, but nothing good, from what I can remember.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nEveryone in this show felt like a flat character that really doesn't have a place or doesn't feel like they belong. The introduction of Sinon into the main cast was poor, she felt thrown in with a shoehorned traumatic background to try and make her seem like a complex character. Her entire character and her background felt forced, really detracted. No one feels unique in the show and everyone is stale, none of the characters are memorable.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was hard to enjoy this series with all it's flaws. Many times in a single episode would I question lots of the events going on in the episode. Was not impressed with the constant use of poor cliffhangers that instantly get resolved next episode only to repeat the cycle of 20 minutes of boring dialogue and little exposition. GGO suffered greatly from the amount of exposition done in each episode, stretching out into an arc that should not have spanned as many episodes as it did. Pacing was horrible.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nNot memorable at all, full of flaws, and not that enjoyable either. Production value didn't seem very high. Would not recommend to anyone in the slightest, and would actually deter people from wasting their time on it.\\n",

However for the second one i'm going to be honest i wasnt that impressed by it. The first arc with GGO was suspenseful and kept you on edge i was more interested in the GGO ARC then the ALO arc. Once they switched to the ALO arc the anime got boring and kind of predictable. Then all of a sudden it got sad as hell towards the end dealing with eternal illness like it didnt have the same suspenseful feeling like the first one. Itdisappointed me because i was expecting more of the GGO arc then the switch up with ALO. The fight scenes were still great tho. The new characters were pretty love able easy to know. I just feel like this anime could have prosper more if it just sticked to the GGO arc and focus more on that than the ALO and all the other mini stories in it.",

            "content": "Another quick review.\r\nI was anxiously anticipating seeing SAO2 since I thoroughly enjoyed SAO.\r\nUnfortunately SAO2 was a bit of a let down. I watched the show in simulcast, so watched each new episode the day it was aired. Each episode felt like absolutely nothing was done during the 22min of show to propel the story. And by the time each episode ended, I kept saying, \"That's it??\" as I anticipated more substance.\r\nThe first 12 episode resolve around the GGO story arch. While it starts out pretty attention-grabbing by introducing us to the world of GGO and the art is really well done... the story develops toorapidly to develop any suspense. Before you know it, Kirito and Shion know who's behind the mysterious deaths AND they know how it's being done. WHAT? How did these two characters magically decipher the M.O. of the murderer? Only thing that was left a mystery was the actual culprit.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then the last 12 episodes is a different story arch, split into two stories. The first is an expansion on Kirito and Asuna's adventure with newly recruit friend Shion. And the later revolving around Asuna's run into some other characters. The second arch was more enjoyable than the first and felt that there was better, more thought out writing than the first. But the animation takes a hit (a la the boss fights that the team goes against looks slopped and half-assed) The final episodes can be some emotional moments, but it's lost when you realized all the lacking elements you had to watch through to get to that point. \\n\\n\r\nFor all the praise SAO has, this one could definitely been better.",

            "content": "Hey everyone, Andre Kumori here, and today I have the privilege reviewing Sword Art Online 2. On the last review, I did a series that I liked, so this time, I thought I\u2019d do some digging into a series that I didn\u2019t like. as much. \r\nLet\u2019s start with a quick rundown of my thoughts with SAO1. Overall, believe it or not, I actually enjoyed SAO1; I mean; it was entertaining, at least. It is definitely one of those anime that has just as many haters as fans, and I\u2019m definitely leaning towards the fan camp. HOWEVER. However. I had three major problems with the season.\r\n(1)Aincrad and Alfheim do not feel like MMORPG worlds AT ALL. SAO could have been the exact same if it was set in a fantasy world, honestly. I mean, that\u2019s basically what they were: fantasy worlds with floating HP bars and menu screens. I mean seriously, how does one EAT in a virtual world??\\n\r\n(2) The pacing. One episode they would be in level 22, then the very next episode; level 57. This made the arc seemingly MUCH shorter than it is dubbed to be and the relationships (particularly the one between kirito and asuna) seemingly MUCH faster than they actually were. Did you know that the Aincrad arc takes place over two years? It does. Apparently. I thought it was only a few weeks.\\n\r\n(3) Asuna goes from lead female warrior with a tough, courageous, independent attitude and strong combat skills to princess in peril. damsel in distress. Disappointment. Enough Said.\\n\r\nOnto SAO2.\\n\r\nSTORY (Gun Gale Online):\\n\r\n\tWhy don\u2019t we just go in order of the arcs. Starting off this magnificent season (SARCASM) is Gun Gale Online. \\n\r\nSo, first of all, when this season was announced, I expected BIG things to happen. I expected the creators to learn the error of their ways during the first season and at least attempt to fix some complaints in this season. Now, before going into any detail, I\u2019ll just do a quick rundown whether or not they succeeded in my opinion. Number one: Nope. Number two: overcorrected in the first arc, okay in last two arcs. And number three: Yes. ..kind of... But only in the last arc. \\n\r\nAnyway, back to GGO. Let us again list the problems.\\n\r\n(1) It takes Kirito THREE episodes to START playing the game. The first three are devoted to plot set-up and introducing the character Sinon. Which is fine and all, but I feel like it could have been condensed into one, or at most two, episodes. This problem paves the way for\\n\r\n(2) Veeeerrrry Slow plot progression. There is a lot of exposition, dialogue, conversation, and just talking and not a lot of action in this arc. It takes forever for anything to happen, and it just dulls out an otherwise okay arc. Now, it\u2019s not a complete snore, mind you, but it\u2019s definitely not very exciting, especially when compared to last season.\\n\r\n(3) Lack of characters. In the last season, there was a plethora of characters and it made the show much brighter and more entertaining, but in GGO, we only have Sinon and Kirito. Now, sure, you could say that this was Kirito and Sinon\u2019s private arc, but logically.. In this arc, Kirito is hired for a job with potentially deadly consequences: to investigate the literal player killer named Death Gun. Why was Kirito the only one sent for a job? Wouldn\u2019t it have been safer if the employer sent a team of multiple elite players together? Maybe Asuna?? Oh well, whatever, he is Kirito.\\n\r\n(4) This next problem is more personal, more of a nitpick, but I just want to get it out there. So first of all, I have never read the light novels. So when SAO2 was announced, with the game being something called GUN GALE ONLINE, I expected to see Kirito in a sleek, cool new outfit and design, wielding a GUN. Something like an anime version of Neo from the Matrix, maybe. Buuuuut, nope. Instead we have, a girly Kirito with a lightsaber. A lightsaber. Please tell me guys, when has there EVER been a lightsaber in a SHOOTING game? Because that sounds really stupid. But you know what, he\u2019s Kirito. Of course he can dodge and deflect bullets. Why not? He\u2019s freaking Kirito. \\n\r\nAlso, was there any reason to give Kirito a feminine look in this season? The only reason I could find was to gain Sinon\u2019s trust. But, did Sinon have some kind of distrust of men to start with? I mean, she has male friend, so I would assume not. And also, why did Kirito go up to talk to Sinon in the first place? Originally, it was just to get directions right (if I remember correctly)? Couldn\u2019t Kirito have just asked a male player for directions? Oohh, wait I see...Kirito you scumbag\u2026\\n\r\n(5) A major flaw in GGO\u2019s story is a certain flashback that Kirito keeps seeing, and he is essentially haunted by it throughout the length of the arc. The problem? This flashback NEVER HAPPENED. Now I\u2019m not sure what is described in the novel series, but the flashback, which supposedly occurred during the Aincrad arc (of the first season) was never in the anime. As a result, it feels like this flashback was completely pulled out of thin air (which it probably was), for the purpose of GGO\u2019s plot and, I guess Kirito\u2019s character development as well. And that, of course, is not good storywriting. For the author to pretend something happened in his last book when, his readers know very well, it did not. Anyone can tell you that.\\n\r\n(6) My final complaint for GGO is the final plot twist. I won\u2019t go into detail so as to not wander into spoiler territory, so I will make this short. To the writers of GGO, you don\u2019t make a plot twist on a character that has been absent from the show for many episodes. And you know why? One: we totally forget about this character, and two: we never really cared about this character, because you also haven\u2019t given us enough time to develop attachment to said character. In all, even though, sure, we didn\u2019t see it coming, that is NOT how to write a good plot twist. I would also like to add..this character is frikkin insane. Case closed. Onto Excalibur.\\n\r\nSTORY (Calibur):\\n\r\n\tThe Calibur arc. And so what does the studio A-1 Pictures follow up GGO with? An even worse arc. This arc entails Kirito (and friends) virtual journey to get the best sword in Alfheim Online, Excalibur. That\u2019s it. There\u2019s no tension. No stress. We just want to play a game, and get an item. Seriously; for what reason does this arc even exist? Guess what, to follow up Aincrad (in which you die in really life when you\u2019re killed in the game), Alfheim (where Asuna would be taken away forever if Kirito didn\u2019t save her), and even GGO (where there is a player killer literally murdering players) we have an arc of Sword Art Online in which, if you die\u2026.oh well. You don\u2019t get the all-powerful sword that Kirito really needed because he was so not O.P. enough before *SARCASM*. Overall, this arc is utterly pointless and a boring waste of time for fans looking for the tenseness and feeling of death staring down your back that the first season gave. (Seriously, I fell alseep watching this arc). Now, granted, maybe this arc wouldn\u2019t have been so bad if Kirito started using this new sword (which he obviously gets in the end, because he is Kirito and is therefore not spoilers) in the next arc.. but he doesn\u2019t even have a big role in the next arc.. which, honestly, was probably for the best.\\n\r\nSTORY (Mother\u2019s Rosario):\\n\r\nThis arc caught me by surprise. It starts off as the now typical SAO plotline starts. There is a swordsman in the game, a player, who is so skilled at the sword that this person knows an 11-hit combo which will be taught to anyone who can defeat the him. Of course, Kirito challenges him, but in a surprising twist, fails to win. To add to the surprise, Asuna hears of this and decides to take this swordsman on herself! Her role as lead female warrior! Is it back?! Then, even more surprising, we get a glimpse of Asuna\u2019s real-life home situation, and a mother-daughter argument and family drama is introduced! Yes!! And to top it all off, a new, great character named Yuuki is introduced as well. Now, before I go off and get into spoilers (because there are more surprises after these), I will move on to talk about my thoughts on the arc. So first and foremost, this arc hit me HARD. With the hammer of emotions. The Mj\u00f6lnir (Thor\u2019s hammer) of feels. HARD. As hard as Clannad Hard. No, HARDER than Clannad Hard. And it was an admittedly beautiful send-off for the season, and probably one of the best-written arcs of the ENTIRE series. There is a lot to love about this arc (especially the characters it introduced) and it is quite out of place (in my opinion) being in the same season as the likes of GGO and Calibur. If there is one complaint I have for this arc, it\u2019s that it has a rather slow build-up, and it just feels like another typical arc of SAO for the first few episodes. But overall, simply amazing.\\n\r\nThe Arts // MUSIC:\\n\r\nIf this series has anything going for it, one is definitely the music. Yuki Kajiura\u2019s epic soundtracks are back from the first season, and OPs and EDs are spectacular as well, boasting the same artists from the last season singing all-new tracks. In particular, I really grew partial to the OP \u201cCourage\u201d by Haruka Tomatsu and the ED \u201cShirushi\u201d by LiSA (which are, incidentally, the themes used for the Mother\u2019s Rosario arc). I was actually surprised, because I\u2019ve never heard Haruka Tomatsu sing with such a strong, powerful voice before (only hearing her do things like \u201cYume Sekai\u201d (SAO1 ED1) and \u201cQ&A Recital\u201d (Tonari no kaibutsu-kun OP1)). \\n\r\nThe Arts // ANIMATION:\\n\r\nAs always, the Sword Art Online series is beautifully animated. The fight scenes are epic, and the worlds and characters are bright and colorful. The only real complaint I have, though it\u2019s not very big, is the world of GGO. The world of Gun Gale is dull and gloomy, with very dark, cold colors and it just, in my opinion, does not display the capabilities of A-1 Pictures\u2019 animation quality to its full potential. But, I guess that\u2019s just the theme with the world.\\n\r\nVERDICT:\\n\r\nSword Art Online 2 is overall, disappointing. The first arc drags on endlessly, and the second arc is completely pointless. However, the third arc is just stunning and is definitely worth a watch. In fact, I would recommend that people just watch the third arc itself. Because, honestly, the only thing you really need to know about the arcs preceding it is that Kirito now has another female friend named Sinon, and he now has a big, fancy gold sword. That\u2019s it. Just watch the third arc. That\u2019s my recommendation, seriously. HOWEVER, for the average Sword Art Online fan just happy for another season with Kirito in it, this season won\u2019t disappoint. Just be warned that it is definitely not as strong of a season as the first.\\n\r\nAnyway this is me signing off. Thank you guys for reading, and I\u2019ll see you guys later.\\n\\n\r\n~ AndreKumori, January 5, 2015\\n",

The story is a near remake, with the differences being there is only one man who can kill, at least for the first arc, and they are'nt TECHNICALLY trapped in the game, but the whole first arc is almost entirely inside the game. The sounds of the laser swords are literally ripped from Star Wars, whichruins it's score. The art and character design are meh, with nothing special but not anything terrible. I didn't enjoy it because they weren't original enough, piggybacking a bit TOO much on the enjoyable traits of the first show. Not much else to say.",

            "content": "Upon watching SAO II, I discovered my love for the series was reignited. I think what made this series so great in itself was it brought back the characters we love and hoped to see more of. I love how the series carries on from where it left off in ALO, and quickly picks up to GGO.\r\nStory:\r\nWell, Kirito is back and so is Asuna. But this time, Kirito has to solve a mystery of deaths assigned to him by...you guessed it, Kikuoka Seijiro. So naturally, the series opens dryly with a big staredown at a table full of desserts and statements about how this isgoing to be a mission only Kirito can solve. It starts off boring at first, but the pace picks up when he meets Sinon, a fellow player in the Gun Gale Online (GGO) universe. Quickly, they became partners and work to take down the Death Gun.\\n\\n\r\nWith a bunch of twists and turns, Kirito and Sinon come to a startling conclusion to Death Gun and his intentions. This leads to the second half of SAO II, the Mother's Rosario arc, which honestly has a lot more Asuna and less Kirito -- but that's okay!\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of this series gives us more Asuna, and more character development. We see Asuna's inner turmoils with her mother, and we see the virtual world in a different way -- when she is forced to use it as a means to show her mother the truth. Asuna also befriends a fellow player, who can use a large combo attack and is \"in tune\" with the game, Kirito notes. However, the reasoning for this is to be revealed in the series last episodes. I won't say it, but I do recommend sticking this anime out until the end, because it goes deeper than SAO I had. If you think SAO dealt with some serious topics, step right up to SAO II. \\n\\n\r\nI'm gonna give the story a simple 8, since it satisfied me and left me wanting more for the next series. Sure, there were some boring moments, but it was going into more details than most animes I watched. And that, I give credit for.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nI think the characters in this series are really well developed at this point. Seasoned veterans of SAO will know the characters since we were so up close and personal with them in the first series. But now, this series takes a plunge even further than the NerveGear can even go, and we are left with new stories and memories to pair with our favorite characters. Asuna feels more independent than before, and doesn't rely on Kirito to save her. She bands together with a new guild, takes a step outside life with Kirito, yet maintains her relationship with him as if nothing has changed. I like this Asuna. She is adventurous, and caring. Kirito also has shifted perspective. We get to see a bit more of what he could be doing post-VMMO, and quite honestly, it works for me. I like the ideas we are seeing. I like how Kirito is becoming a character that is intellectually smart, and also cunning. I love that he is more than just swords and slashes at a monster; Kirito has become the future CEO of a company, if anything. He has promise, and I am excited for what is going to happen.\\n\\n\r\nI give the characters a 9/10. My only issue is that we didn't see more of the friendships the returning characters as much as I wanted.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI rate sound at an 8, mostly because some of the returning songs do become boring at times. However, some of them fit perfectly. Yuki Kajiura's work never ceases to amaze me, however I feel we could have gotten a bit more new songs in this series. The Opening and Ending songs are perfect, and I didn't really skip them. So obviously, I liked those. However, the songs used in the first series do wear thin after a while. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nCharacters look great, I love the colors, and as always I love the way it looks. It's very pleasing to the eye, but I think that's the general direction of anime  these days, with computer advancements and what not. So I am giving it a 8, since it's not blindingly amazing but not ugly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy recommendation is that you watch this series, if you are a fan of the previous anime. However, if you feel distant with the series, please stick it out and see it until the end. Maybe your opinion won't change, but you can honestly say what the series was like and explain fully why you didn't like it. If you don't like it, then that's fine. But I am sure returning fans will love it.",

            "content": "I am going to be brutally honest here. If you have watched the first season then i would not recommend it as it only puts sour to the beautifully crafted first season. A far-cry from it's prequel, the anime focuses less on the instantly Op'd MC then on a character that seems to have a pretty dull and a dual character. While it has some moments of its sparks, the anime split in two arc's seems to be a mixture of log horizon and tales of the abyss with no blood boiling story line.\r\nWhile the character development is something to look out for, the basesetting seems to have too dark of a setting with not the same story line.\\n\r\nIf you are looking for some screen time for the MC or a relationship development is definitely one to skip but maybe I am being too partial as for the anticipation i had after the first season.\\n\r\nHowever it has some early glimpses of being an upliftment the story never does take off and only deteriorates further down the episodes.\\n\r\nThe new antagonist however does bring something new in the table in the first arc even though as one would suspect of twisted logic and intentions. With some light humour and certain wow factors present it does help to land some pillows for its downfall. The Mother rosario arc Focusing on Asuna only her die hard fans would find it watchable.\\n\r\n Overall: Watch it only if you have nothing else on mind as it does have 4 or 5 wow episodes in the midst of hmm i know where this is going.",

They have powerfull motivations and goals and it's involvement in the series is excellent.\r\nBut getting into the good stuff the animation is so good, dedicated and you can definitely see the effort behind it. \r\nThis theme of the VRMMO is so interesting and I fell in this anime reallyquick mainly because of this.\\n\\n\r\nAs a sequel I think it works perfectly and you get the felling that this two are really the same anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverral... this anime has everything if you are searching for an entertaining and interesting anime.",

            "content": "I admit, I entered this series biased. A lot of people had harped on to me about how terrible it was and the community in general likes to tear apart anything with a lot of popularity that may not been accompanied by an appropriate level of quality.\r\nCompared to the first season, Season II also has a very different tone. Much of the first seasons draw was the tension of being trapped in a game with real-world consequences and what this might lead some people to do. This is not at all what the second season is like and it does take a moment to adjust.Having said all this, before reading the review, if you haven't seen it yet, i do recommend watching it for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nStory & Characters:\\n\r\nSAO s2 has 3 mini arcs that i will go over separately as they vary greatly in content and tone.\\n\\n\r\nArc 1: 7\\n\r\nArc 1 involves Kirito being hired by detectives to investigate a player who is apparently able to murder other players through the game. Along his way he meets Shino who is playing the game as a method of dealing with her phobia of guns.\\n\r\nEventually Shino's character and the murderer's character get fleshed out and the plot does go to some interesting places regarding guilt and fear (in Shino's case) and power play (in the murderer's case). The final battle was suitably climactic, although i could have been spared Kirito doing his thing for once. just once.\\n\r\nArc 2: 4\\n\r\nArc 2 involves Kirito and gang embarking on a quest to attain Excalibur in Alfenheim. To be honest, this arc felt entirely filler and I don't although not entirely unenjoyable really dragged the pace.\\n\r\nArc 3: 9\\n\r\nArc 3 is where the feel trains hit. Arc 3 involves a player known as the ultimate swordfighter (yes, even better than Kirito... maybe) who, it turns out, is terminally ill and asks for Asuna's help to embark on a final quest.\\n\\n\r\nArt, Sound and Voice: 8\\n\r\nOnce again, i don't have much to say about the art or sound - which is usually a good thing. Everything fits together fine to add appropriate atmosphere to the show. At times, it's light-hearted, at times expository and futuristic, at times emotional and at times dark and tense.\\n\r\nOnce nitpick that i still have with the show is that it doesn't make sense that main characters have unique player avatars while everyone else looks drab and generic. \\n\r\nThe voice cast continue to do a great job all round. This may be where i once again inject some personal bias as I simply love Miyuki Sawashiro.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: 8\\n\r\nWhile i expected to hate this series, i came to appreciate the different tone that it went for. The last arc in particular hit me hard with the feels train and their where moments of tension in certain parts.\\n\r\nOn the downside, Kirito still does his thing to every girl he meets. We get it, you think nice guys get the girls. I could have done without the romance elements, though thankfully it's not as heavy as in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nSome nitpicks that i still have regarding this entire series is that gameplay elements are still rarely fully explained. In the first season, there was a scene where Players Killers couldn't deal serious damage to Kirito because he regenerated health faster than they could damage him, yet he never regenerates health again in the whole series. In this season much of the way magic, swordplay, skills etc still isn't particularly explained and the emphasis is placed instead on the emotional journey of the characters. I can't help but feel that these are missed oppurtunites for building a believable setting.\\n\r\nThroughout the show, the series brings up some light philosophical discussion on the nature of perception and reality. I'm not tech genius but perhaps the world is not that far off from when we are able to digitally recreate physical stimuli equivalent to what one might feel 'naturally'.",

            "content": "After finishing the season finale a few minutes ago, I thought I would share my opinion on the SOA II while it's still fresh. In short, my review of the second season of Sword Art Online can be summarized with a resounding \"meh\", maybe adding a small sigh of disappointment.\r\nSOE sliced a huge trench in the middle of the anime community, one side hailing the series as the best thing ever, the other side condemning it to eternal hellfire. My opinion is somewhere in the middle. It was pretty good story-wise, the art style, the world and the setting was great, but the writing andthe characters were awful, plagued by dreadful writing and horrible pacing.\\n\\n\r\nBut for SOE II, it looks like the creators learned....absolutely nothing. It's almost exactly the same as SOE. Again, introducing a pretty great setting and idea in GGO with pretty good art and lots of possibilities, only to bring the whole thing down with terrible writing, characters and a frankly mind-boggling second half. This time, the pacing wasn't just bad, there were entire episodes in which absolutely nothing happens. Nothing of significance anyway, save for some redundant and meaningless dialogue that adds nothing to nothing. The characters in SOE weren't anything special, but in SOE II they've become so utterly bland and incoherent, not only did I loose the little interest and connection I had to them, but I even started having problems telling them apart.  Kirito became a shadow of his SOE self, losing all sense of coherence, switching between \"MMO god\" and \"broken psycho\" seemingly at random. This went to the point he was benched and later degraded to a support role in the last arc, which was probably a good idea considering the alternative.\\n\\n\r\nShoving the series back into \"fantasy fun fairy land\" ALO was the final blow to the series for me. Asuna became front and center for most of the second half, but since her character was even more forgettable and empty, it made no difference. All the other support characters slowly congealed into a grey, bland mass, to the point I completely lost interest in what was happening on the screen. The arc with the quest for the Excaliber was utterly meaningless. Why would the Almighly Kirito, the demigod of all VRMMOs, need an overpowered special sword, when he can easily crush hordes of enemies and players without breaking a sweat anyway? Again, the whole thing was entirely pointless, there was no bigger picture, no character development, no intriguing story, nothing even remotely interesting or meaningful. It was the embodiment of \"meh\". \\n\\n\r\nThe last arc was just plain infuriating. Using horrible diseases and terminal child patients to try and incite some form of emotion from the audience was just disgusting. I never thought an anime series could stoop so low. No, I don't have a problem with entertainment mediums portraying terminal diseases and those suffering from it in the right context, but SOE II was clearly just using this as drama bait, a tool to rake in some sympathy points, nothing more.  An incredibly underhanded desperation move from the creators.\\n\\n\r\nI wanted to like SOE II so hard! I was waiting, from episode to episode, for the series to finally take off, but...nothing. It went out as it came, with a wimpy fart noise. There were some real possibilities in there, for good stories and characters. I really liked the GGO setting, the Death Gun arc, the raid quest mechanics in the latter half, and as much as I despised the execution, the technology to use virtual reality to ease the suffering of terminal patients was a really intriguing idea, that should've warranted more exploring instead of force-feeding us cringe-worthy drama. All in all, SOE II is just a series of missed opportunities and wasted possibilities drenched in a whole lot of bland and boring nonsense.",

            "content": "I had previously harshly criticized the first SAO, for all the imaginable reasons except soundtrack and okay visuals. But ever since then, whenever I heard \"SAO\" all that came to mind was bad written story, shallow/annoying character, lazy plot and a terrible script. \r\nBefore SAO II, I was almost harassed to read the light novels. I tried, but as a person who genuinely loves reading, those texts were simply too bad to present any kind of interest. \r\nI started SAO II out of sheer curiosity and because naivete can push one to go back and try again even in the most hopeless of situations. Iwas also intrigued when die hard SAO fans said SAO II was \"so\" bad. \\n\\n\r\nSAO II indeed has about nothing similar to the initial SAO. Its major improvement is the fact tha it stops centering around Kirito and although his harem is still around, there is a lot more depth to the female characters. Basically, SAO II is about the girls, who from now on stop being just a soulless crowd around the absurdly powerful male lead.\\n\\n\r\nSAO II, although it still addresses a very young audience, has a very prominent psychological take to it and presents two dramatic faces of the virtual reality dive. Unlike the first SAO, who centered on ingame events, SAO II centers around real life issues that drive one person to escapism. Cheesy, but relate-able. If SAO was dealing with the game impacting real life, SAO II deals with life impacting the ingame experience. \\n\\n\r\nThe first half is the story of Shion, a girl troubled by some childhood traumatic event, who tries to deal with her inner fears while facing them inside the game. The second half centers around Asuna and her new girlfriend.\\n\\n\r\nShion arc is the kind of story most gamers can relate to. It makes you wish Asuna was Shion. It is a very good action packed arc, with good action and powerful cliffhangers. \\n\\n\r\nAsuna/Yuuki arc redeems Asuna for being just an annoying, shallow character by providing more background to her real life. She is no longer the perfect princess, perfect housewife, perfect warrior. And this is where you realize that her only defect was the lazy author who embodied her to be a sort of ideal feminine persona but only kept that in his mind,not bothering to actually write about Asuna's human sides. \\n\\n\r\nSAO II has a lot more real world scenes and from that point of view, it could be cathegorized as a slight slice of life. The first SAO lacked in this department, so this is indeed an improvement (fictional characters that are interracting in a fictional world which is also  fictional world for them do no build much credibility, wouldnt you agree?).\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good, has a great impact on the dramatic scenes and the OPs/EDs are actually carefully composed. However, the music itself is not the least bit original, as basically all the chorus sequences try to copy the Kajiura Yuki's .hack//Sign pieces. Quite a good copy i'd say, but... plagiarism is bad. \\n\\n\r\nSAO II is packed with a few very intense fithing scenes. However, the second half lacks tremendously in the animation sector, frames being all choppy, looking rather like a photo stream than a fluid animation.\\n\\n\r\nI woudl say SAO II is worth a watch. Definitely a lot different from the first SAO and you might find that everything that annoyed you in the first one, was corrected here, even though, overall, the show could have been exploited a ton lot better to its potential.",

            "content": "SAO 2 Review\r\nThis review is a lot bigger than I anticipated (even by my normally long winded reviews), so if you want a brief overview of my critique and thoughts, see the summary below.\r\nSummary: \r\nSword Art Online 2 (or the second season) makes slight improvements over the first season. There is a noticeable effort to bring back psychological elements and an attempt to add depth to characters. It sometimes succeeds. The problem is it also tends to fall prey to some of the first seasons flaws, making it seem that this season failed to learn from its previous mistakes. However, what is here is stilldecent and ends on a surprisingly strong note, with a slightly better story and some new cast members being added to the mix. While the keywords in this review are: \u201cslight improvement\u201d, I did at least appreciate the attempt being made. It managed to be slightly better than I expected, but still not coming close to reaching the hype fans of this series are glorifying it to be (with one minor exception being the Rosario Arc at the end). Overall: 7/10. \\n\\n\\n\r\nBackground: \\n\r\n\tAfter the first season stopped airing, it was clear that this anime was incredibly polarizing and divisive, with debates still to this day whether or not this anime series is garbage or excellent. Personally, I fell somewhere in the middle and tended to see both side\u2019s arguments. So when the trailer (and forgettable filler movie that I don\u2019t plan on reviewing because it was a waste of time) arrived for season 2, many fans were excited and anticipating (especially those who haven\u2019t read any source material) what this season would bring. After it finished airing, most people hadn\u2019t had their opinions swayed one way or another (or at least, that\u2019s the impression I got). Critics still tore it apart for being mindless, generic and clich\u00e9 while fans still really enjoyed new additions to the story and characters. I was ready to give this another chance after the first season left me disappointed and unfulfilled. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPlot/Story: \\n\r\nPhantom Bullet Arc\\n\r\n\tThe plot (and additionally the setting) in this initial arc and in general is a little more intriguing this time around, attempting to play to the strong suits of the first season. Those were: the fear of death seeping in what\u2019s supposed to be a fun, MMOFPS game, psychological scars showing up frequently, how to deal with loss, that grand scope of exploring new virtual worlds and an escape to try and hide any hurt you have or misgivings with your life through technology like the NerveGear. I admit in that last point that I am stretching it, but to be honest, this season had made some improvements (for the most part) to the overall plot. It had a decent sense of mystery and suspense and while there were some small moments that I thought tried to suspend disbelief too far, its efforts weren\u2019t as in vain as it was the first season. \\n\r\nThe second half of this arc does get a little slow plot wise (with Asuna and Kirito\u2019s harem just sitting there and doing little of anything to help things) and a couple episodes in particular (more OVA\u2019s then arcs) are dreadfully boring.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCalibur Arc\\n\r\n\tSpeaking of dreadfully boring\u2026 yeah. This arc came and went and had little to no impact on me. Honestly, it showcased all the WORST traits of the first season. Kirito being an ungodly and omnipotent force that trashes everything in his wake, Klein being pigeonholed into comedic relief\u2026 and the harem of Kirito\u2019s being dull and one note (sadly including Sinon now\u2026). Sorry, but this arc is like that lame side quest in the game you stumble upon and wish you could escape from as fast as possible. Thankfully, things were about to get much better\u2026\\n\\n\\n\r\nMother's Rosario\t\\n\r\nSay what you will about the phantom bullet and calibur arcs\u2026 THIS is the arc I will always defend and stand up for. Why? For the first time in a LONG time in this series, I was emotionally invested more than ever before and cared for the characters involved in these short 7 episodes more then I cared about anyone else after 36. I was shocked again watching this series\u2026 and unlike last time, the shock was good. VERY good, in fact\u2026 I won\u2019t go into detail what happens, but the last four episodes are by FAR the best episodes of the entire show, giving more depth to characters who felt hollow and adding in new characters that were easy to sympathise with. The last two episodes in particular were well done story and character wise, giving me what I always wanted from this show: a reason to care and to get emotionally invested. I would love to go into more detail into what happens, but I want to leave that to the audience to experience for themselves. Laugh if you must, but I am standing my ground here. For the first time, I saw and experienced what fans of this franchise saw from day one.\\n\\n\r\n So overall, I may still be slightly underwhelmed with how the story played out, there were some improvements and the last arc in particular was a pleasant surprise. Overall: 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (This is going to be a long one\u2026 sorry):\\n\\n\r\n\tThis is another aspect that saw some improvements. Our main lead Kirito is still unfortunately stuck in the wish fulfilment rut. However, he does get some obvious PTSD from everything that\u2019s happened thus far. On some level, I appreciate that they gave him something more to his character and showed that the events of the first season weren\u2019t just forgotten completely. I think though that for his character, it\u2019s a little too late. I still appreciated the better intentions this time around. \\n\\n\r\n\tWhere the character aspects of this anime start to shine is with our new heroine. Sinon is a sniper who is very talented at the game GGO (Gun Grave Online). She seems to exhibit the initial character of Asuna more\u2026 at first. Much like Kirito, she has dealt with some PTSD due to events in her past and thus give these characters something to relate to and have in common (which is more than I can say for Asuna and Kirito). On the whole, I actually liked her character quite a bit more than the rest of the female characters. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, she seems to be struck with the \u201cOMG, Kirito is super hawt and now I like him\u2026\u201d illness that plagued the other female cast. I would\u2019ve preferred their relationship to be more platonic (like Hawkeye and Mustang from FMA), being good friends but not another romantic interest. Also, I couldn\u2019t help but to think what Asuna would think seeing her cling onto Kirito this whole time\u2026 one last point about her character is that\u2026 the fanservice\u2026\\n\\n\r\n I am of the belief that fanservice is much like Icing. I heard something on the topic of fanservice (and I am paraphrasing here): Think of any given anime like a cake. Icing is much like fanservice. Adding some icing can sweeten the cake and that cake more enjoyable then it already was or help make a bad cake better. But overuse this element or solely rely on it and eating that much icing can make anyone get sick or ill and not enjoy what their being served. In hindsight, using cake analogies when describing female characters creates subtext that I REALLY wanted to avoid, but the same can be said for SAO and SAO 2. Her character is overly fanserviced and it was distracting.  It\u2019s still a problem that plagues this franchise and reeks of trying to tantalize audiences with cheap gimmicks when her character never needed it in the first place. It can tell people who care about her character (like I did) that they have so little confidence in her character development that they have to show off some uncomfortable ass shots of the high school girl.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe villain this time around is pretty striking from a pure character design basis. Though his name (especially what he calls his weapon of choice) is remarkably silly and hurts the ominous atmosphere and mystery his character brings. The new side characters (including Sinon\u2019s friend) are mostly ok but get more interesting as certain plot developments arise in the second half of the Phantom bullet arc. \\n\\n\r\n\tThere is only two more characters I wanted to talk about: Yuuki. I won\u2019t spoil what happens in the Mother\u2019s Rosario arc, but I thought she was probably the best developed character in the entire series. With the short amount of episodes they gave her, they did a good job giving her a fleshed out character who didn\u2019t join Kirito\u2019s moe harem (thank God\u2026) and for the first time in a very long time in this anime, gave me a reason to truly care and get emotionally invested in the characters. Also, Asuna is significantly better here, but aside from this arc at the end, is on the whole forgettable and a non-presence.  Overall: 6/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\n\tThe soundtrack this time around was\u2026 pretty good. While I might prefer some of the warmer orchestrations and some of the more melancholic tunes of the first seasons, this one feels appropriate for the post-apocolyptic setting on display. The grungy, distorted guitars on tracks like Gunland help amp up the action much like Swordland did for the first season, essentially taking that song and injecting it with steroids. While the soundtrack is mostly dominated with a more electronic feel this time around, tracks like \u201cThinking Tenderly of You\u201d and \u201cPeace again\u201d are standouts, with beautiful piano compositions and create a more emotional and peaceful atmosphere. The latter actually reminds me of the soundtrack from the 2003 version of FMA. Other tracks like \u201cShe Must Overcome Her Fear\u201d are also kinetic pieces that help keep the action exciting and intense (which it is overall). One last aspect of the soundtrack are the more haunting songs. I think this was a great addition as it plays to the strengths of having characters go through traumatic experiences. And what I mean by that is it helps amplify and convey those feelings to the audience.  Overall: 6/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: \\n\r\n\tAs was the first seasons, the art and animation in SAO 2 is great. The majestic and fantastical settings in the first seasons are swapped for post-apocalyptic and (this might just be me) some heavy cyberpunk locations. Since the emphasis here is more on gunplay then on swords, the animation nicely reflects this change in battle scenes. Gun fights are well done, with a feeling of intensity and stakes rising in the Phantom Bullet arc. The final battle in that arc had some pretty stellar animation, as well as some scenes in the first few episodes. Overall, it still holds up nicely and actually improves as the show goes on. Overall: 7/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n\tMuch like the first season, I still enjoy this series despite all the plotholes, glaring flaws and dull characterization. I did enjoy this a little more than the first because they tried to remedy and fix the issues I had with the first season. It seemed like the story was stronger here and more effort was put in rather than: \u201cWell, how can we make Kirito look more god-like then we already have?\u201d I don\u2019t have much to say here because my thoughts are mostly the same from the first season. Still good popcorn entertainment with a little more sustenance this time around. Overall: 7/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: \t\\n\r\n\tAs for any last thoughts, I don\u2019t really have much since I have said everything that I wanted to above. I will say though that if it hadn\u2019t been for Mother\u2019s Rosario, I might have felt left down again and disappointed. But much of that final arc significantly helps this anime and redeems some of it for me, making me legitimately glad I watched it. It had some heartfelt and emotionally touching scenes (even cried at the end, but that\u2019s nothing new for me), good and fast paced action with slightly better characterization and backstories. Some scenes are still cringe-worthy and it still has many of the same problems the first season had, but I felt that more effort was being put in this time around. So because of that, I will also be a little more generous with my score this time around. If you enjoyed the first season, you will likely enjoy this as well. Overall: 7/10.\\n",

Both seasons have those episodes that just aren't good, the first season would have been the execution of the Yui arc's fishing episode, this season's would be Sinon's introduction, but everything after that-when we get to know more about her is just fantastic.\r\nSword Art Onlinehas always been a series that tackles as many genres as possible, if you're not open minded and only wanted an action or only wanted a romance; you're more than likely letting yourself down by not appreciating what it brings to the table. My biggest fear for this series is that season 3 somehow doesn't have as fulfilling an ending we had for each sequential season but part of me just knows it's not gonna let me down. We've had 3 great ending scenes already between the awakening from the Nerve Gear, the reunion of Kirito and Asuna, and even this season's ending was great because we know what our main characters want to do with themselves and work toward a goal for the future.\\n\\n\r\nI actually love that this series' reviews are often as low as they are, because it tells me that they're being left out of how much I enjoy this series....and I feel so bad for them.",

Fans And Haters, and i am the latter one.\r\nFirst of all, i am expecting everyone reading my review has already seen the season 1. the series started with all its might. Both the season consists of 4 story arcs ( 2 each). and my explanation will be based on both the seasons so that the viewers can compare.\r\nStory:(3/10)  story of season 1 first arc was truly splendid and exciting. being trapped in a game, and the only way to get out was to kill theboss in the last floor. Yes, the protagonist was overpowering, the the story kept it well balanced. \"excitement graph\" went down after every episode for me, until the near end, where it finally got interesting...... after that starts the second arc, the alfheim arc. i had high expectations from it, however they added the \"incest\" in it which ruined my interest totally. the point of the alfheim arc was that they needed to clear the game, however no one was able to reach the top......... except that the protagonist did it so easily that it made no sense to me.......... Season 2, arc 3.... i had high expectations from it that finally the studio realized their mistakes and might improve it....... however, it got even ruined, hey added even more harem, and made the protagonist even more powerful..... i finally quit, but later on decided to watch the 4th arc, i don't even wanna say anything more, but it was even worse.\\n\\n\r\nart (8/10) the art style was amusing, i really liked the art as well as the action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nsound (8/10) nothing less to be expected from Kaziura Yuki. the soundtracks were superb and supported the scenes very well.\\n\\n\r\ncharacters (2/10) totally bad. i hate how they try to add more and more harem in the already messed up story. the back stories about the characters were nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2/10) i didnt enjoy it at all. however its a biased opinion. some people might enjoy it, as there are many harem/romance fans out there who dont care about the story. the point that SAO already has 7.5+ ratings proves that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (4/10) the reason that it got 4 instead of 2 in overall section was because of its sound and art. personally i hated it.",

The song here is definitely not for VRMMORPG styled anime.\\n\r\nThe first OP, is a little fast and up-beat. The first ED was okay. Then comes the other ED,\\n\r\nwhich is as good. It ranks up as Courage is actually heartwarming.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nGood job breaking every character ever, hero-kun.\\n\r\nThere was a little to no development to Kirito and his harem.\\n\r\nBut Asuna, oh Asuna. She at least gets more attentions which is good.\\n\r\nHer motherly character is shown in Mother-Rosario. She actually struggle, she actually can feel\\n\r\n(more than Kirito) for her friends, she actually wants to be free, etc. Her \"flaw\" at least make her\\n\r\na bit more believable to be a character, not just a mime waifu of badass.

            "content": "Disclaimer: This review is mostly for my personal use.  I'm reviewing this so as I can give ratings as well as my justifications to each \"arc\" of this series.  This is likely to be very opinionated.\r\nArc#1 Desu Gun:  This was by far the worst part of the series, boring, trite, and predictable.  Death Gun's motivation was sketchy at best, and the whole thing grew dull very quickly.  I don't know why I watched beyond this arc, though I do not regret doing so.  Some of the fight scenes were fun.  2/10\r\nArc#2 Excalibur:  I thoroughly enjoyed this seriesof episodes and was kinda sad that it was so short.  It was a very simple storyline that allowed for the action to \"shine\".  It was nothing excellent, as far as anime goes, but I thought it was fun, and a nice little touch.  8/10\\n\\n\r\nArc#3 Mother's Rosario:  This one was another let down.  The first half seemed promising, and kept me wondering at this new characters plight.  It was also quite enjoyable with the boss fight thrown in.  The latter half, however tries to hard to make me sad.  If I weren't a sucker for any thing remotely emotional, it would have made me roll my eyes.  I did, however, like some of the themes dealing with Asuna's conflict and relationship with her mother, making this arc \"above average\" to me.  6/10",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nAs both a fan and a hater of the show (Nice to meet you!), I pretty much seen for myself what's good and terrible of this much-talked about second season of Sword Art Online. \r\nI would like to make 3 parts for this review (for each arc), but I don't want to bore you with more than 1 review with 1 review. (Huh?) \r\nFirst, let's go with how the first season left us off. Kirito has finally got out of the Nerve Gear, and has saved Asuna who was trapped in Alfheim. After all those events, his name became known not justin the virtual world, but as well as reality. \\n\\n\r\nPhantom Bullet is the title of the first arc (technically, third). Here, Kirito is asked (with accompanying moola) to investigate a player named 'Death Gun' who can kill a player in real life when he shoots him with his Type-54 Black Star pistol in-game from the VRMMORPG Gun Gale Online, a game that focuses on the use of guns. \\n\\n\r\nThe second arc is the Calibur arc where they receive an unusual mission from an NPC named Urd, which would seem to end all of Yggdrasil. \\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, the Mother's Rosario arc. Here, Asuna meets a player named 'Zekken' (English: Absolute Sword), the leader of the Sleeping Knights guild. This encounter would better the relationship of Asuna with her mother, along with a memory that will forever be etched in the hearts (well, technically, minds) of Alfheim Online players.\\n\\n\r\nStory: (5/10)\\n\r\nWhat makes a story 'effective'? A combination of something comprehensive, and an awful lot of elaborate story-telling. This season, my dear friends, consisted just, as Australians would say, a 'wee' amount. \\n\\n\r\nOn the first arc, Kirito gets paid to investigate a player that could somehow kill players in real life. Sounds original? No. Why would they be surprised in the first place? Because it is 'unusual' for an AmuSphere to have that kind of effect? They already knew that someone could die in real life by dying in Aincrad, and with a few tweaks and hacks to an AmuSphere, that would become possible. \\n\\n\r\n(Let's not talk about the episode 14.5 here, please?)\\n\\n\r\nThe Calibur arc then stirs up what's of Alfheim. Seriously? They have plots like that in the game? What would happen then if no one was able to receive that side quest? Perhaps, I should bid farewell to all the fairies. \\n\\n\r\nThe Mother's Rosario arc, however, had a heart. This tells the story of Yukki, Asuna's new friend, and the guild leader of the Sleeping Knights. In real life, these people are actually bedridden or have some life-threatening disease. This is a brilliant arc of love and friendship. And what actually contributed in making the series suck less.\\n\\n\r\nCome to think of it, this season is actually a medical turn for SAO. (Raise your foot if you are a graduate of medical or health sciences. I!) \\n\\n\r\nI have a few problems for this season, though. Despite the fact that Kirito stupidly risked his life once again, this season seemed rushed and had a lot of crappy side plots that made the story uninteresting and just plain. Not to mention how scarce the emotional part of the last episode was. I was at the point of crying, but no. You would just be left as you are: Hanging.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (9/10)\\n\r\nDuring the first episodes of the show, the animation seemed different from what I loved second (Note: first would be the music) from the first season. Kirito looked different, and Asuna didn't have that 'bloom' she had from its former. An explanation for that would be the production shifting from Aniplex to A-1 Pictures. But, the succeeding episodes provides you that first season-SAO feel. I guess the production just needs some getting used to it.\\n\\n\r\nI also loved the scenery during the Bullet of Bullets tournament, and how the colors turned from shady to a picturesque perspective of J\u00f6tunheimr. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (10/10)\\n\r\nNow, let's get to the part where it actually is interesting. Eir Aoi's 'Ignite' and LiSA's 'Shirushi' are just a few additions to the best anime themes you would ever hear. Ignite provided a massive awesomeness in introducing the Phantom Bullet arc, as well as Shirushi providing a heartfelt and emotional ending for this season. They really add to what makes an anime more awesome. (Like, Fate/Zero). \\n\\n\r\nI also like Haruna Luna's 'Startear', 'No More Time Machine' by LiSA, and 'Courage' by Haruka Tomatsu. They were also themes that gave you that 'I need to listen to this first' before proceeding with the episode, or going to next one.\\n\\n\r\nI would prefer Eir Aoi's 'Brainwash' or 'Utakata' (from the Ignite single) to start the Calibur arc though, but I'm not hating on Haruka Tomatsu's song, especially when it has that melodious intro.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack were also good. Some are recycled from the first season, but were still in the most appropriate times.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting were the same: fitting and suitable. There are times though that Konno Yukki's voice sounded annoying, but still, it was good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (8/10)\\n\r\nIn terms of character development, this season provided sufficient. \\n\\n\r\nAsada Shino is the focus in the Phantom Bullet arc, the second new main character introduced this season (next to Death Gun). And for Zekken, who was the third arc's main character.\\n\\n\r\nSinon is Asada Shino's avatar. Her character, I would say, would be the best character from this season. She is full of fears and anxiety, but she tries to overcome it. By the end, it also showed that people are still afraid, even after overcoming what they fear most. It's very realistic. And, she is so cute. Nya~\\n\\n\r\nThis season also introduced a lot of new characters. Shinkawa Kyouji, Tonkii, and the guild member's of the Sleeping Knights.\\n\\n\r\nWhat made it lose points though is that when they provided new characters, old characters were just forgotten and set aside. Supporting characters need enough exposure to actually 'support' a main character. \\n\\n\r\nLike, that one time that Agil was just standing in the background, serving drinks, without dialogue. Seriously, people. That is not the right way to treat secondary characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9/10)\\n\r\nAs a guy that plays shooting games, the first arc definitely was a hit for me. Then comes the second arc which were again full of swords, with a mention of an Asgardian god. (I'm not a fan though, as I like Captain America.)\\n\\n\r\nAnd the magnificent story of Konno Yuuki, and how she tried to survive the complications of HIV/AIDS was just heartwarming and very emotional.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, as an 85%-fan, fanservice were through the roof. Yay!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (8/10)\\n\r\nI honestly waited for the second season of this show. Was I impressed? Yes, but not much. Was it good? Yes, but lacking. Was the action sufficient? Yes, but needs more. All in all, Sword Art Online II is another sequel that would either disgrace or surpass the former. It depends on the understanding of the viewer, as well as a fan's struggle to continue loving the show. \\n\\n\r\nI should say also that I'm looking forward for another season. Why? Alicization.",

            "content": "SAO II takes a different turn than season 1. The usual adventures of Kirito and Asuna is now over. SAO II smashes that concept. SAO II is divided into 3 arcs. Excluding Caliber, GGO is all about Kirito and a new character and Mother\u2019s Rosario about Asuna and another new character. \r\nSAO II also is different in the atmosphere it gives. Same themes and messages but different execution. Although SAO II sucks, it\u2019s still better that the first one.\r\nSAO II is more drama rather than a romance/action-driven story. Its first arc, the GGO arc is about Kirito crossdressing as a girl in a gun game.This arc is actually bad in terms of writing for me. BoB is boring and the drama is not written well. Caliber, although short, is actually better than GGO. The fights are amazing in fight choreography. Mother\u2019s Rosario is the show\u2019s saving grace. Although decent, it still bad in when it executes drama due to this it creates artificial drama that happened in every feels episode in Mother\u2019s Rosario. Besides that, everything is decent and good.\\n\\n\r\nSAO II has a bad track of poorly made character like the the first season. Some characters are well-develop. Other characters suffered from the poorly written drama.\\n\\n\r\nSAO II keeps up its decent animation. How the fights are choreograph is simply amazing especially Zekken vs Asuna. SAO II\u2019s music is better than the first one. Ignite and courage are amazing songs and fits for the show. Endings are endearing and sweet. OSTs are really good as expected of Yuji Kajiura.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I must say, SAO II is improving in its problems from season 1. Still there is still room for improvement for SAO II. SO HOPE THAT SEASON 3 WILL BE BETTER.\\n",

            "content": "Okay, so any fan of SAO would probabaly have a lot to say about the second half of this anime. I will start off by stating that the anime itself I love, I love the characters, the intensity, the feels, the art - pretty much I love everything. Now with that said I do have a few things to say about this second part. \r\nFirst off- I enjoyed that they kept the relationship between Kirito and Asuna pretty well known and evident, but then he meets Sinon and for a moment my heart stopped thinking that this little sniper girl will get in the wayof one of my OTP's. Glad I was wrong there, overall meeting her wasn't to bad and she turned out to be a great add on to the ALO grouping. \\n\\n\r\nSecondly- I had no idea that there was going to be anything beyond the GGO arc, since the hype was so built up that I literally thought that was what the whole season was going to be about, but wait. That wasn't the case at all. Once they defeated death gun and moved on they moved back to ALO where they re create some memories of SAO and airncrad. This leading into some back story about Asuna and Her family life- slmething I really enjoyed since we never really got to know about any of that in the first half. This also bringing us to meet another group of good characters, Zekken aka yuuki almost being able to be titled the strongest swordsman in ALO including that of kiritos reputation was an Intresting and fun twist, until the feels. Now I don't want to spoil it for anyone reading this review but let me just say one thing, and for the record this is part of the reason I love this series, but - meeting new and love able characters to add to the story is always wonderful, especially if you like that said character, but word of advice for anyone watching this series, be prepared to be emotionally ruined and have your heart ripped out at any moment.\\n\\n\r\nAnd thirdly, my last and final statement, this anime series will always be close to my heart and I hope they continue on and make more anime for us to love and grow and feel too. Overall the first half of season 1 will probabaly always be my favorite but with all the build up and hype everyone puts on this one, I'm glad it lives up to its reputation.",

            "content": "Foreward:\r\n- Before I may or may not hurt the feelings of the readers of the review, I'll go ahead and say SAO is neither as good, or as bad as people make it out to be. However, if I were to side with an opinion, I'd probably go with the criticizers. This review will be written with the assumption that the readers have already seen SAO II. I'll use a mostly objective point of view, but with support for my opinions.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nStory: 4/10:\r\nArc 1 (Phantom Bullet):\r\n- Set inside a new world, Gun Gale Online, the Phantom Bullet arc was disappointing to say the least. After thebitter taste that the previous season left with its second half, I began SAO II with the hope that it would have a strong start like the original did. Honestly, nothing in this arc really appealed to me. The battle royal idea was interesting, but the fact that most of it was spent on borderline romantic intentions between Kirito and Sinon rather than actual action let me down to say the least. Nothing was really memorable about GGO, and a few episodes later I almost completely forgot about it.\\n\\n\r\nArc 2 (Excalibur):\\n\r\n- Just when I thought it couldn't get worse, the 2nd arc completely fooled me. Dear god this arc was boring. It's honestly safe to say that this was complete filler. I shouldn't have to say much about it, because NOT MUCH HAPPENED IN THE ARC. It's the type of arc that you could completely skip and not lose much. The original arc hardly developed in this sub arc. Oh yeah, it was also just a single quest inside Alfiem Online, arguably the very thing that destroyed season one.\\n\\n\r\nArc 3 (Mother's Rosario):\\n\r\n- To me, this arc is by far the best of the three. Ironically, I enjoyed the moments spent outside of VR. This arc is IMO one of the things they did right. The story was actually pretty good. Almost enough to be considered emotional. \\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nArt/Sound:\\n\\n\r\nNot much really to say here. It's pretty much the same as the first season. The art is on par with today's animation, but nothing stellar. Same goes for the soundtrack, except I'd say it's a little better. \\n\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Characters:\\n\\n\r\n*Sigh* Along with the issues surrounding the plot, the characters are indeed a weak point of the series. Fanservicey, melodramatic, and underdeveloped are just a few words I could use to describe even our MAIN characters. \\n\\n\r\n- Kirito: Receiving absolutely zero development besides the fact that he's a trap in GGO, Kirito is the same as he was in the original SAO. A perfect, ladyloved Overpowered generic main character, who always saves the day and succeeds no matter what.\\n\\n\r\n- Asuna: Like the first season, Asuna received little screentime aside from her role in the third arc. However, she DOES finally receive a backstory.. (yknow the generic my parents know best for me but i'll prove them wrong in the nick of time kind of backstory). Disappointing right?\\n\\n\r\n- Sinon: Irdk how to feel about this one. While she received a hefty amount of screentime and development in the first arc trying to get comfy with Kirito, she suddenly disappears. I wasn't exactly on board with this, because I wanted to see more of her.\\n\\n\r\n- Yuuki: My favorite main character. Unlike the others, her story felt genuine. It received full development and when her time came I felt something because I became semi-attached. The writers did a pretty good job with this character's development.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n(If you stuck around to this point of the review, congrats.)\\n\\n\r\nConclusion (enjoyment): Overall I can't really say I hated this show. However, I'm indifferent, leaning on the side of hating it. Where did this show go wrong? Maybe the first season at the beginning of the second arc? Maybe. I had high hopes for season two, since after the mixed reception of the uber popular first season, I figured the writers would really step their game up. Looks like they didn't do such a good job. Regardless, I'll probably still watch the third season, out of obligation.",

            "content": "This plot of this season was good, not great or even very good, it's somewhere between meh and good. It had a similar plot twist as the Aincrad arc. If you watch enough anime or movies with a masked villain, it will 9 out of 10 times be a character that is already introduced. I don't know about any of you but I kind of predicted who Death Gun was so without the surprise it didn't have a good effect. \r\nSame as the first season it had outstanding artwork, definitely a 10 for 10. I don't have many thoughts on the sound but it definitelywasn't bad. As far as characters go this is all I have to say: Can the guys at whichever studio not go a single season without having a mentally unstable rapist as the antagonist??? For fucks sake half the reason I hate the 1st season is thanks to Sugou, and now they pull a Sugou Jr. on me. I'm not really going to talk about what happens after the end of Gun Gale, it pretty much just has the friends hang out and then transitions into the next season with Asuna as the MC.\\n\r\nConclusion: If you haven't watched it yet, and is planning to watch it, don't get your expectations up too high, it's not as good as Aincrad but I'm sure some of you are already so disappointed with ALfheim that you are ready for anything they throw at you; but worry not it isn't nearly that bad.",

They story for the first half was interesting enough to keep me watching, but after the first half after they get out of gun gale online, I couldn't figure out what the story was. I gave the story a 9, only because of the first half. The animation style I would say is about the same as Sword Art 1, but I loved the first Sword art's animation style, so I left that the same. The audio was great as well, since it was the same reasoning forthe animation. The characters were the one problem I didn't hate, but it bugged me. They kept the same uninteresting cast as before, but then they introduced Sinon. Sinon I thought was the most interesting character. Then after they left GGO, she only appeared in about 2 episodes after that, then immediately forgotten. You do see her on the last episode, but she says nothing, and has nothing to do with the episode. The only other interesting character was Yuuki. She was a patient dying of the infamous HIV virus. She intrigued me because she was one of the best players in the game they played, and she was always seen as a happy individual. Sadly, she was killed off on the last episode, so no Yuuki on Sword Art III. I did enjoy this anime alot, especially throughout the first half. I did enjoy the second half, but not as much as the first. Overall, if you liked Sword Art 1, you will like Sword Art II.",

            "content": "I'll just say I was a little late to the party on the Sword Art Online hype train. And after finishing it I really had to talk with a buddy of mine about what I really watched. And like all animes I go in blind.\r\nAt First: \r\nThe first arc where Kazuto goes into GGO (GUN GAME ONLINE). That was what I was watching the anime for. I was watching to see the gun game being the main focus as Kazuto and new friend Sinon try and take down \"Death Gun.\" Of course Sinon at first is a rival/friend who doesn't fully trust Kazuto because ofa pretty bad past in her own right..and the fact he has a female avatar, but was a male. (Pretty funny stuff) I'm not going to dive too deep into the story, but that's exactly what I was watching for.\\n\\n\r\nThen:\\n\r\nOnce the GGO storyline is mopped up we then fall into what I thought were basically fillers. The two story arcs that follow the GGO arc happened. That's really all I can say. There was a pretty important quest TO SAVE ALFHEIM! (Which is then promptly forgotten.)\\n\\n\r\nWell now comes Asuna's storyline. And like usual she is having an issue with a parent. No not as bad as in season 1. But still her mother is pretty aggressive with her tactics of pushing her daughter. But this whole arc went by quickly as Asuna meets another new group.... Just an aside. The 3rd arc can actually be pretty sad, but it took awhile to even get there i was a bit burnt out.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end. It just felt like after they finished with the first arc there was just filling in on what they were doing next. Even the way they moved on from the Alfheim arc was forgotten. Either way SAO 2... is a 7 it's good because the first arc was the meat and potatoes of the anime...only for the next couple arcs to fall in....The 3rd arc can be a tear jerker tho. So if someone asked me, \"How was SAO 2?\" \\n\r\nIt was good...",

            "content": "Third Review! Now where to begin with Sword Art Online 2 (or SAOII)\r\nHonestly this was incredibly better than the first season, I loved that more characters got more higher roles than Kirito (Main Protagonist). The plot was better than the first season as well, it wasn't all based upon one guy being overpowered (although for the first half I guess you could say he was still OP.) The plot however gets better, the second half of the season, was my favourite in all of SAO so far. \r\nNew characters were introduced and a whole new world, this meant more to see and new introductions. Thenew characters where well developed and well thought of in my eyes, they had their own personalities and they had their own crazy thoughts. \\n\\n\r\nAnother great thing was the animation and the art, SAO never disappoints me with this (as I am a computer geek and work in IT) It's outstanding and shows of what creators can do with modern technology. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this a lot better than the first season, definitely the second half, I really loved that it wasn't all about one boy and his fantasy Harem. If you loved SAO then you'll love this too, if you hated the Harem-type side of SAO then this is better for you. I gave this high marks as I did really enjoy it and I did love the characters and the story. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of people hate and really take their anger out on this series, but honestly I think it has been a good series so far, the first was rushed and could have shown more, and the Harem-ness could have been laid off, but I really liked this series and if you enjoy games and adventure in them then this is a great anime showing that side. Honestly, this is probably what we will be ending up like in the future anyway! \\n\\n\r\nCanaan ~",

SAO 2 mostly sticks with three arcs for its story and no im going to tell you what they are called but i can sum it up in a few words. The first arc is action packed, the second arc is to me considered the filler arc for the series and the thrid and final arc is (at least imo) very emotional.\r\nAll of the main characters returnand of course you can't have a new show without adding some newbies as well so for this season we get introduced to two new characters Sinon and Yuuki and their nice new additions to the series as they liven up the situation and one can or cannot make you cry. (yes i am not joking when i mention that).\\n\\n\r\nThe art style for SAO 2 is visually good to look at and yes even though it uses some cg visuals at certain times its still is nice and pretty to look at and the same could be said for sound as the music score is really good and sure some of the music you might of heard in season one is there but it makes sense to put it in this one as well because it is used very well in certain situations.\\n\\n\r\nOverall i personally enjoyed the show and i reckon if you like the first season of SAO then you should definitely try to give this one a shot. the same can be said if you like action style anime.",

            "content": "\u201cThere are things you can only share with someone by fighting. For instance, how serious you are.\u201d\r\n--Yuuki Konno\r\nSword Art Online\u2019s first season arrived in 2013 with all the storm and bluster of a Nickelback concert. It racked up massive commercial success and drew a legion of dedicated fans and haters by appealing to a very wide audience. On Western shores, SAO took on a life of its own, aided by a spectacular English dub with some relative unknowns in Bryce Papenbrook and Cherami Leigh putting together excellent breakout performances in the lead roles of Kirito and Asuna. Fans hailed its colorful cast of characters andnovel premise, while haters decried its impossibly perfect protagonist and lackluster execution. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I stood on both sides of this \u201clove or hate\u201d divide, originally disliking it and growing to like it after watching it with friends. While it\u2019s nothing too spectacular, I thought the premise was compelling, the characters eminently likable, the romance sweet without being sappy or swallowing the plot, and the action scenes well-choreographed and animated (insert ridiculous Kirito face meme here as a counterpoint). The second arc lost a lot of the head of steam the first season had established and had stripped my favorite character, the daring Asuna Yuuki, of a lot of what made her compelling, but still managed to turn it around into a satisfying conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nSo when Season 2 rolled around, I delayed a little in watching it until just last month to avoid having hype/hate circle-jerking poison my opinion of it. It felt like an inversion of the first season in a lot of ways. The first arc of Season 2, Phantom Bullet (or GGO, or Sinon Ass Online, whatever you want to call it) is a reintroduction to Kirito as a character, and an introduction to Shino \u201cSinon\u201d Asada. Sinon is a high-ranking sniper from Gun Gale Online, which is another VRMMO game created from the \u201cworld seed\u201d of Aincrad. The two meet while Kirito investigates the identity of a new \u201cplayer-killer\u201d, the enigmatic Death Gun, who possesses the power to kill players for real by shooting them in the game.\\n\\n\r\nPhantom Bullet is also the dullest story SAO writer Reki Kawahara has told to this point. The big battle tournament has no real tension to it because you already know Kirito\u2019s gonna win. Sinon comes off as a prickly asshole to Kirito for very little reason, and Kirito\u2019s own motivations for entering GGO are never quite clear other than \u201cthe government asked nicely and bought me lunch\u201d. The pace feels slow, the climax/big reveal is something of a disappointment. The only redeeming quality I can show for it is that Sinon as a character develops quickly, and Kirito is, as always, the man when it comes to action scenes. The animators at A-1 Studios know how to draw ferocious 1-on-1 sword duels, but that talent is lost on gun battles, which feel very passionless, rote, and dull.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc of SAO II, if you haven\u2019t given up after 14 episodes of GGO, is Caliber, which is a bit of a return to form and a return to the cast of Season 1 as they gear up to take down a tricky quest in ALFheim Online, the setting from season 1\u2019s second arc. It\u2019s mostly an excuse to dredge up characters like Suguha, Silica, and Lizbeth to actually get some screentime, but it\u2019s alright, and seeing these characters is like coming home to old friends if you enjoyed some or all of them in the first season, as I did. Especially after 14 episodes of almost zero presence.\\n\\n\r\nCaliber is two episodes long before segueing into Mother\u2019s Rosario, the final arc of the season. As if to balance out and apologize for Phantom Bullet, we get what is definitively the best SAO story ever told, centering around Asuna and her rivalry and friendship with \u201cZekken\u201d, the strongest swordsman in ALO (yes, even stronger than Kirito). I can\u2019t spoil anything about this arc, but it deals with very serious subject matter, and the philosophy of life and the virtue of machines and virtual reality within it, with respect and heartfelt authenticity. It made the season for me. It hit me right in the feels. It made me think. And it elevated my respect for Kawahara as a writer. The OP and EDs for Mother\u2019s Rosario are compelling visually and aurally, and gradually change as more is revealed about \u201cZekken\u201d and their guild, the \u201cSleeping Knights\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the show is mostly unchanged from the first season. One of the shining points of SAO for me is how it gets across the feeling of being in a video game fantasy world. The colors are bright and contrasted. The characters\u2019 in-game avatars are sharply reminiscent of their real-life appearances but with a fantasy twist such as elf ears (or in the case of Silica, dog ears?). Which is another reason GGO disappoints me: it\u2019s just dull to look at, having copied the brownish-tan dominant visual style of \u201cGRIM-N\u2019-GRITTY\u201d American first-person shooter titles as an inspiration for its setting and character design.\\n\\n\r\nSword Art Online II is very uneven, but still has moments where it shines, sometimes brilliantly. The conclusion paves the way for further sequels and movies, much to the chagrin of its detractors, but I\u2019ve never had a problem with something just because it\u2019s geared for commercial success. Indeed, as a show for newcomers, I think SAO is a great representative sample of what anime is all about. Some will never watch other shows and declare that SAO is \u201cthe best ever\u201d, and of course they are wrong, but it\u2019s still worthy of the acclaim and following it has earned. Some will declare it a cliched mess of tropes and stereotypes, but I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that those people hate this show just because it has reached the level of ubiquity and recognition that it has, and will never be happy with it no matter what (and usually even they do not deny that Mother\u2019s Rosario is great).\\n\\n\r\nI ultimately gave the show an 8, although it is closer to a 7.5 for me. It falls just short of the standard set by the first season because it fails to consistently be good, but the heights it reaches are much higher than those set by the first arc. Mother's Rosario is a rather daring step forward, and hopefully we will continue to see similarly ambitious arcs in the future of the series.\\n\\n\r\nUntil next time, continue to make your mark!\\n",

            "content": "Not as good as the original SAO, but still definitely worth watching if you liked the original story. A lot of the characters from season 1 return like Klein, Lisbeth, Silica, and Kirito\u2019s sister Leafa which I liked because I really liked all these characters and some of their character designs from season 1 have changed because now they\u2019re all playing ALO together. Also, season 2 explores the lives of Kirito and Asuna outside of virtual reality more which was really interesting.\r\nCharacters: A new character season 2 adds is Sinon and honestly I think I may love her more than I love Asuna. Asuna andKirito are still my all-time favorite anime couple, but if I compare Sinon and Asuna as stand-alone characters I love Sinon a little bit more than Asuna. Why? First, I think if Sinon and Asuna ever got into a fight, Sinon would win. Second, I really like how serious and focused Sinon is, she really doesn\u2019t show much emotion which I think makes her even cooler. Plus, after Kirito and Sinon team up, Sinon discovers that her and Kirito actually have a lot in common and are both trying to live knowing they did horrible things to survive. \\n\\n\r\nDeath Gun, the new villain for season 2, is also awesome. I love how he kills people by appearing out of nowhere, shooting somebody, and then disappearing; it\u2019s really ominous and creepy like you never know who he\u2019s going to kill next. I was disappointed that I figured out who Death Gun really was before the show revealed it, but it was still cool watching Kirito play detective again while trying to solve the mystery. \\n\\n\r\nStory: The fight scenes really get better in season 2 because in GGO players fight with guns and grenades and almost all the action in season 2 is players fighting other players which is awesome. It adds bigger variety of fighting styles too because now there are snipers like Sinon, machine gun using power players, and silent assassins like Death Gun. Also, while SAO and ALO were both fantasy games, GGO is much darker and edgier like one of the battlefields in the game was this abandoned city with graffiti and rusty cars\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I do kind of miss how in the original SAO players were trapped in the game and developed their own little lives inside the game, but now players can log out anytime so the mood of a most of the side characters is a lot less serious. Although, I guess they make up for because season 2 we get too Kirito and Asuna lives in the real world and I was actually pretty surprised to learn how hard Asuna has it with her family. \\n\\n\r\nThere are 2 more story arcs after the Death Gun story arc which take place in ALO, but they aren\u2019t quite as good as Death Gun. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you liked the season one of SAO, you have to watch season two. \\n",

            "content": "I have read the reviews on MyAnimeList.net.  Yes, I did enjoy the first Season of SAO (Sword Art Online) with a few reservations (Side Characters left in the backdrop, the lack of resolution of major plot questions, etc...) but found the overall series enjoyable.  It basically left me wondering whether SAO II would be worth my time, and the reviews I read informed me it wasn't.  Reluctantly, after exhausting every other anime on my list from last year, I told myself \"What the hey?\" and decided to take a look at this series.  I'm happy I didn't let the negative reviewsdissuade me.  SAO II has its flaws, but its notable strengths are its saving grace that, at the end of the day, make the show enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10  \\n\r\nThe story is split into three separate arcs:  the Gun Gale Online, the Calibur, and the Mother Rosario arc.  \\n\\n\r\nGun Gale Online brings our ole boy Kirito and a new female character, Sinon, center stage.  Contrasting the previous sword-swinger that was the SAO world, Gun Gale... focuses on Gun combat, which makes this arc feel more like Call of Duty rather than Kingdom Hearts.  I personally found the gun fights less jaw-dropping, yet more tense.  A gain and a loss, but definitely not a net loss.  More of Kirito's harem coming along would have been nice, but the chemistry between Kirito and Sinon was well done, as well as insight into how people in this world use VMMOs to cope with reality.  For better, and for worse...   \\n\\n\r\nThe Calibur arc was definitely the weakest link of three.  Kirito and his gang come together again in the world of Alfheim Online.  It rings nostalgia, reminiscent of the SAO days, but without any of that foreboding-danger push that had you biting your nails in Sword Art Online, or the much needed character development many in Kirito's monster-smashing harem lack.  The arc really tries, but just comes up short.\\n\\n\r\nThe Mother's Rosario arc's story is where SAO II truly shines.  Asuna is the star this time (bout time, right?), and things couldn't have been better.  The arc delves more into her personal life, as well as her trials with the Sleeping Dragon Guild in their attempt to conquer a Floor Boss.  For Kirito fans, this arc will leave a sour taste in your mouth.  For fans of the show's ability to demonstrate the implications of VR's integration into our reality, this arc will be sweeter than honey.   \\n\\n\r\nArt:  7/10\\n\r\nStrong artwork dominated for most of the viewing, but some of Kirito's combat movements in the GGO arc had me wanting to claw my eyes out (reminded me of Madara fighting the 7 Shinobi Alliance in Shippuden).  The first Opening integrates our characters' real and virtual worlds meshing beautifully and artistically, while the transition from the second Opening to its second version was refreshing and emotional.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThey say any great soundtrack disappears subtly into the backdrop, and SAO's music gave me that appeal... perhaps a little too well.  The first opening music was strong, and probably the only one I could see myself listening to while driving down the road.  The music generally flowed well with the mood, but most of it fails to stand out.  Play it next to your Final Fantasy soundtrack, and you sadly won't be able to tell the difference.  The music does it job, but that's all.   \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  6/10\\n\r\nAs usual, this is THE weakest link for this season, as it was for the first, but the crazy thing is it CAN do characterization well.  It just chooses not to do enough of it...  Yes, major points for Kirito, Sinon, and Asuna, but everyone else gets left in the dust.  Unacceptable for a seven-person team.  Why not cut that boring Calibur arc for the Beast-Tamer Loli (Keiko), or the Lovable Blacksmith (Rika), or heck, even the Chivalrous, Always-Second-Place Samurai (Klein) to have a chance to shine?  Sheesh...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Conclusion:\\n\r\nDespite its flaws, SAO II was undoubtedly entertaining.  The action was stellar, the emotional moments will elicit sympathy and tears, the plot develops well with exciting reveals, and, when the story does decide it wants to include some backstory, it's presented concisely.  The greatest sin of SAO II, as with its predecessor, was attempting to be too many things at once, an ambitious endeavor SAO II can never quite get right.  At moments the show was an action Shonen, at others a harem, at others a romance, and at others psychological.  If SAO, both seasons, stuck with one formula or another, people would receive the show more openly for reasons of clarity, and less confusion would allow character interactions to transition better from plot-to-plot.  But then, what would SAO be?  Another .Hack Sign?  Monster?  Naruto?  Log Horizon?  By trying to hit the stars, SAO II represents what the first series did well for me:  It provided me with something different from psychology thrillers with no action, bromances lacking logical and natural female interaction, romances with only needless drama to fuel the lovers' connections.  SAO II fails to reach the heavens it aims for, but still becomes a star in its own right by the attempt.  Looking forward to season III.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nSolid 8/10",

            "content": "Sword Art Online. It\u2019s interesting to see how much this series have divided the anime community. Some hated the first season, others proclaim that is was the greatest thing ever. Many had mixed views. So when the second season was announced people had to see if it was going to flop in a similar way that the first season did. I for one was pleasantly surprised\r\nSTORY:\r\nTo clarify you have to watch season one of SAO to understand anything that is happening in this season. We have a new VR game called Gun Gale Online or GGO. In this world there is a player by thename of Death Gun going around and shooting players in the game, but after he shoots them they die in the real world. Kirito is called into help solve the murders as he has experience dealing with this kind of thing in SAO. He meets a highly skilled player named Shino and she gets to tag along to help solve this mystery.\\n\r\nPersonally this arc of the story (Phantom Bullet) is very well done. It has a sprinkle of conspiracy and mystery too it that really freshend up the series to me. While it may be a little far-fetched it remains in a reasonable realm of possibility that it didn\u2019t become a big distraction. There weren\u2019t any times during this arch were I thought, \u201cWow this is so unrealistic and stupid\u201d I was more wondering \u201cWhy is this happening and how is it happening.\u201d Can\u2019t believe I am saying this but it reminded me a little bit of Death Note in a way.\\n\r\nThe second arc is about trying to get a legendary sword and honestly it is not worth talking about as it is mostly a filler arc that felt a lot more \u201cgame like\u201d and was not entirely interesting to me.\\n\r\nThe third arc however\u2026 wow. To me the third arc of this season was one of the most touching moments I have experienced in my short anime watching experience. In this arc Kirito passes the protagonist torch to Asuna and it was a much appreciated change. We are back in ALO and there is a player named Yuuki who is trying to find a strong player to fight. Asuna ends up helping a guild called The Sleeping Knights, their quest is to defeat a floor boss and get their names inscribed on a monument to be displayed forever. Asuna also has to deal with her mother who is disproving of her school and of Kirito. The rest of my analysis will be spoilers. \\n\\n\r\n[THIS SECTION CONTAINS MAJOR SPOLIERS MOVE ON IF YOU HAVEN\u2019T WACTHED]\\n\r\nAs it turns out Yuuki is terminally ill and plays VR MMOs as a way to interact with a world and feel important. The rest of the guild has similar problems as well hence the name, Sleeping Knights. Yuuki has been in a dive for over 3 years. To me this arc is very touching. Many people have health problems or social problems and use video games as an outlet. This part of the story feels extremely realistic to me and relatable. Yuuki and her friends want to leave a mark on the world, something that people will remember about them and this is their way to do it. Phantom Bullet arc also touches on games as a coping mechanism as Shino uses GGO as a way to get over her fears of handguns. I felt that these themes made this show much better than it\u2019s prequel.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nKirito is relatively the same as before. He is prevalent in the GGO arc but becomes a side character in the later arcs. Asuna gets some good development, I enjoyed the tension between her and her mother. That felt real and semi-relatable. Shino is an interesting character. She gets plenty of screen time in the GGO arc and her backstory while somewhat far-fetched really helps explain her personality and actions. Yuuki while having a late appearance in the show makes a great impact and is honestly the most realistic character in the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION: \\n\r\nLittle has changed in the animation department from last season and it still holds up very well. GGO looks good and the fight scenes we very good. The art style is still good looking and holds up to some of the recent releases. No complaints in this area, see my review of season one for a larger dive into the art and animation. \\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nI skipped the OP most of the time, not this it was bad but it just wasn\u2019t really my thing. I really enjoyed the ED of this series. Insert songs were good but we repetitive especially in ALO arcs but they are great sounding. I was impressed at the action sounds in the fight scenes and the detail that they went into with making different sounds for eat sword clash and steps even to the moving of armor. I watched this show dubbed and it was very well done. The cast of the first season reprise their roles here. I do believe that Bryce Papenbrook is becoming the new JYB as he is getting typecasted as every young angry teenage hero (which covers 90% of all action anime but I digress) \\n\\n\r\nENDING/CLOSURE: \\n\r\nTo me the ending is paramount as I like closure in the shows that I watch. This ended with a short of \u201cguess what I found something\u201d If the story ended there I would be ranting  right now however the story has a movie that was announced that will take place after this season so that makes this section irrelevant.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION:\\n\r\nI enjoyed this season greatly, while I had many complaints about the first season this season made up for a lot of those gripes by continuing with great action and giving us a story that seems realistic and characters who are more relatable and just better written than in the first season. This show was good, and I recommend to continue watching this series. \\n",

            "content": "When I first watched Sword Art Online I loved it! But once I thought more about the plot and development of characters, I felt SAO really fell short of what it could have been. Despite its issues, I still think SAO an enjoyable anime to watch.  Please knowledge that all of this is my opinion :)\r\n*Note: I have excluded sound but I will agree that it is great!*\r\nCharacters\r\nThere are only really three new and important characters introduced in the second season, them being Sinon, death gun, and Yuuki. I'll start with Sinon. She is easily my favorite character of the entire series and herdevelopment (throughout the GGO arch) was fantastic. She is one of the only truly interesting characters from SAO in my opinion, and I found her to be incredibly unique. Her development in the first part is unrivaled by that all the other characters. Sinon drives pretty much the entirety of the show, as Kirito is useless as ever. Death Gun is also a pretty great character, and I consider the concept of his character to be stronger than the execution of his motives. I really liked how they set up the illusion of Death Gun being just a single person, and the way the mystery played out was done well. The boy (no clue what his name is) has in interesting complex and relationship to Shino (aka Sinon). Sadly, Kirito got pretty much no development for the rest of the series. The second part of the season was terrible in terms of development for side characters (literally only Yuuki and Asuna got some development). Yuuki was introduced and I honestly didn't care for her at first, actually I never really cared for her. Although the premise of her character is unique, her personality was quite bland and incredibly common. Her development was pretty good, but it sent the pace into a whirlpool of inconsistency.  I liked that Asuna finally got some development, despite the effect it had on the season as a whole. There was much better character development this season, but only for specific characters. All the side girls were ignored throughout the season, which I found stupefying. Even Sinon became a mute member of Kirito's harem-wannabe thing, which somehow undid a lot of the greatness Sinon's character built up in the first half. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty much on the same, awesome level as the first season. I have no complaints in this area. I would like to talk about the one new aspect that was introduced in the second season: GGO art. I actually love the darkness of GGO and how it contrasts the style of Alfheim (and SAO) completely, yet is somewhat similar to the way real life is depicted throughout the series. All in all, the art was great and saved the anime at times.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nSimilar to last season, this season suffered horribly from inconsistent pacing. GGO had a medium pace, which I enjoyed most of all. From there, the pace took a sudden rise in the random and completely out of place Excalibur arch, which was a show of the great animation and pretty much nothing else. After that, the pace hit something like a brink wall. All of the sudden the story decided that SAO is a slow slice of life anime with a bit of gaming. Although I would not have minded a spin off, OVA, or separate season of this arch, because this arch made no sense in the context of the season. While I'll admit the character development of Asuna and Yuuki was well done, it doesn't really fit when you put it up against the GGO arch. The GGO arch is easily my favorite of the series. The premise of the story actually makes sense, as it presents the issue, the protagonist's opinion of the issue, the solution in theory, and the resolution of the issue. Although it is not a very unique structure, the details in the arch help to make it new and different from other series. The skipping between real life and the game was well done (in both arches, although especially in GGO arch), and I liked the how the arch came to an end. I also liked that the OP level of Kirito made so much more sense. He struggled with working a gun and actually has to base all of his strategy off his sword skills.This seems much more realistic and opened doors to improve upon Kirito's development.  The second half of the season was much more inconsistent in both pacing and character development. First of all, there was pretty much no premise in going to get Excalibur, as that previously (terribly weak) antagonist just kind of asked Kirito to do it without much reasoning at all. Secondly, the execution of the arch was terrible. The entire fighting scene only took about 10 minutes, which is less than one entire episode. It is just stupid to have a super hyped arch in the series if it is just rushed over and butchers the set pace, while simultaneously adds absolutely nothing new or interesting. The transition between the incredibly quick attack arch and the Yuuki arch was not smooth enough and resulted in a bizarre feel from the wack pacing. The Yuuki and Asuna arch was interesting enough in terms of plot and I don't really have too much to add because there really is nothing much to add about it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSeason Overall\\n\r\nI really loved the start of the series, and felt that Sinon, Death Gun, and the GGO setting were interesting additions to the series. Despite these great new aspects, the series ruined itself in the second part of the season. The Yuuki arch was a pacing disaster that had it's moments, but was a train wreck in many ways. The horrific dialogue and lack of character development ruined the potential of the anime. Again, you see all the side characters from SAO. They get to fight a little, but otherwise get no new development. As much as I wanted to really love this season, it failed to pull through in the end.",

            "content": "Phantom Bullet arc: The best of the three\r\n1.Shinon is not a good character but she is far better than Kirito, whom I despise like as a character at all (If you have seen the Calibur Arc you will get it+He is the prime Gary Stu). \r\n2.Characters were mostly bland and it had a story that at least was less convoluted than S1 but still convoluted. But the biggest flaw in the story is that the title is completely irrelevant except of the fact that there are most of the characters we met in SAO Season 1. e.g. Sword Art Online and it has guns insteadof swords. Also, even if there was some development in Shinon, it was done in a superficial manner.\\n\\n\r\n3.Soundtrack was average.\\n\\n\r\nCalibur Arc: The worst!!!\\n\\n\r\n1.Characters are not standing out, except Kirito of course. Klein is supposed to be Goofy in the group, while Shinon is the main character who had to become generic and boring so that she could be part of the harem. Also, one interesting thing is that she is the only girl in the harem that does not have any love interest in Kirito.\\n\\n\r\n2.In general most of characters in SAO are treated like comic relief or minor so that Kirito stands out. \\n\\n\r\n3.I was not fond of the op from this arc. I loved the op from the next arc more than this one.\\n\\n\r\nMother's Rosario: It was very melodramatic and some things were off, for instance filler characters that do not play a big role. But, the biggest complain was that it was too short and the drama was kind of forced. But, I would rather watch a whole series based on Yukki as the main character than being burdened watching the SAO franchise so far.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.24/10 with a preferable recommendation to skip it. That is pretty much everything you need to know. The producers have made some small corrections in comparison to the previous season but still the show contained major flaws from the previous series and ended up being an average show. What is shocking at least to me is how differently the second season is perceived. It was not well-received by the fandom, while the first one has been considered even as the \"Saviour of Anime\" (LOL XD). However, just as much as the first season, it is beyond  great and even decent. Still, it has some enjoyable features as a show, which might have explained why the series has become hyped.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online, the anime that everyone loves to hate and for good reason. Sword Art Online II continues the trend of having a pretty good first half, then a very bad second half. The real redeeming quality of Sword Art Online II is the introduction of Sinon. She is maybe the fist character in the series with any real depth and she escalates the plot to new heights. Kirito is the same old predictable character, they attempt to add depth to his killing in SAO but it doesnt really feel genuine. The story is interesting enough in the first half and Gun Gale Onlineis a cool game. If you're watching SAO II, i recommend you watch the first half and stop there. The second half of SAO II is downright terrible, and even makes the second half of SAO proper look good. It feels pointless and its overall boring. They try to make you care about a new character, but overall they fall short. Sinon is one of my favorite anime characters of recent memory and if it weren't for her, the second season of sword art online would not be worth a damn. If you didn't like SAO don't even bother, but if you did like it, watch the first half of season 2. It enjoyable enough.",

They could of made the story line a bit diffrent. Like, Completly.\r\n- Has gun instead of swords. This is a great idea but it is so unbalanced how kiritos character has so high skill Points. And kirito could not let go of his sword so they brought star Wars in here :/ Im disapointed A-1 Pictures\r\n- Keeps onbuilding his harem. Yea what a great idea to add another member to kirito-sama's harem. apparently kirito likes to have a lot of Girls at the same time and 1 dude, but no one cares about him.\\n\r\n- Trapped in a game for 2-3 years. a couple of months he is already doing workout and in a perfectly fine shape... they could of waited a little longer.\\n\r\n- Clotes. Sinon has way to little clothing on... isnt it Cold sinon? while kirito wears a cloak he still frezzes in the lobby -_-.. i realice that almost everyone look the same (exept Kirito, Sinon, and that one blue guy).\\n\r\n- Seriously bullet lines... Yea cus the sniper isnt op at all (Thats all i have)\\n\r\n- Apparently kirito meets a chick everytime. It would fit to throw in a character With flat chest or a loli. meh it is the creators choise.\\n\r\n- Yea cus this series isnt bad enough you have to throw in a rapist to? Fuck that one scene when you could feel the love trought the sky...\\n\r\n- And didnt kirito reset his character in \"Sword art Online I\"? I Guess he used his admin Tools to give himself Points?\\n\r\n- \"Sword\" Art online II - \"Gun\" Art online II (meh its just my imagination)\\n\r\n- They went from tinkerbell to a chick who reduced her landing With recoil... or at least i think so...\\n\r\n- \"want me to come by Your Place\" \"Rea... No im fine\" *comes anyway*\\n\r\n- Yea kirito isnt enough alone \"Lets get exalibur\".. You get the point\\n\r\n- The art was trough the roof and the sound was pretty good, the light saber was probally just sounds from star Wars xD\\n\r\n- Why didnt he just make a sword or buy one With real Money he got a shit ton on his job so i dont see why not... oh bought gir would make him look weak because they would had to reduce the skill of the poor guy.\\n\r\n- I sort of enjoyed this series it had some unfitting moments but it was very enjoyable. -HappyAnimeGuy",

            "content": "So about a month ago when I finished re-watching SAO I wrote a review about it and in that review I said I'm gonna write a review about SAO II when I finish re-watching it. And it's time for me to do that.\r\nSAO is probably my favorite anime, with Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. SAO was the first anime I completed watched in English (except DBZ; btw. English isn't my primary language) and I really liked it a lot and then SAO II came out, of course I watched it and it was very good too (then). But now I feel like I overrated bothSAO and SAO II. In my SAO review I rated it with 10 even though it's too much (but it's one of my first anime shows). The realistic rating for SAO would be 7. But let's leave that here and let's review SAO season 2.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story is a lot worse than SAO's story (SAO didn't have a good story) and there are some plot holes. I feel like the first and the last arcs of this anime are fillers. Just because Kirito (or Asuna in the last arc) leaves everyone behind and they focus on their \"missions\". And that's the only disappointing thing in SAO II. SAO gives us a real story, they want to get out of the game, so they proceed in doing that, but these are just filler arc's. Kirito and Sinon beating Death Gun and all the other characters are left behing. Mother's Rosario arc - Asuna joins some unknown people just because she got interested in Yuuki when she beated her. Fillers, fillers everywhere!! I would have liked better if this season was focused on Kirito's and Asuna's relationship. Like Asuna has to get married and has to leave the school. KIRITO, dude, saveee her! This would be better than this filler arcs. Or at least other characters could play with them in GGO. But everyone is just left behind. This is not a season, this is bunch of side stories. That ruined SAO II.   Story: 4/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Here I have nothing to complain about. Everything is well-drawn. I like all the gun designs and character's designs. Have to say I \"fell in love\" with Sinon's design. They gave her such a great design, but such an \"empty\" character. And Death Gun's design is so amazing, but I grossed out when I found out who Death Gun actually was.  Art: 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: like the first season, the themes and opening are great. Except the first opening \"Ignite\". I really didn't like Eir Aoi's voice. I prefer LiSA. Everything characters say is easy understandable.   Sound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: You all know SAO's characters. The only new important characters are Sinon, Death Gun and Yuuki. Sinon and Death Gun are well-designed characters with lore. They gave them their \"personalities\".  Kirito and Asuna were just like the first season, but the other were left out. What is the purpose of Klein, Sugu, Yui, Silica, Liz and Aegil in SAO II. The anime would be the same without them... A lot of lacks on characters.   Character: 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This part is not for me. This is just a very symbolic anime to me and I can't give less than 10.   Enjoyment: 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Even though Story and Character are worse than average, I'll give it an 8 because it's symbolic to me. But, for you all who watched SAO season 1 and aren't so hyped about watching season 2, I'll advice you to stay away from this and just drop it. Overall: 8/10 (for me) and 5/10 (if this wasn't so symbolic to me).",

            "content": "after the first season of sword art online, i was thrilled to hear about this second season, hoping it would thrill me like its predecessor did. and for the most part it did, but it also had more to gripe about. but the good first, hopefully i can do this without spoiling anything important for anyone who hasn't seen it yet. a pretty good story, at least the first 14 episodes, which make up the phantom bullet arc. the action scenes, especially in the latter half of this arc were a sight to behold. the sound quality was stunning, as was the music. but thenew main character, sinon, i thought was too much of a drama queen to really be taken seriously, although she did have her moments. and why kirito had the avatar that he did made no sense to me. but that wasn't too bad a gripe as the other two arcs' stories were. the second one, calibur was only three episodes long, but had a pretty good story, including an epic battle against a behemoth of a boss. the third, which comprises the last 7 episodes was called mother's rosario, and this was perhaps the worst in the series because it had nothing whatsoever to do with the rest of the story, it felt unecessary and overdrawn, and we could have done without it, but other than that i was impressed by this second season. good story, at least while it lasted, great sound effects and music and good, although sometimes annoying characters, lead me to this conclusion: great beginning, good middle, and a letdown of an ending. my verdict 8/10 very good (perhaps a little generous, but that's just me) let's hope that the upcoming movie brings back the magic of the first season, but that won't be out until next year so we have plenty of time to debate and speculate...",

            "content": "\u201cEngage people with what they expect; it is what they are able to discern and confirms their projections. It settles them into predictable patterns of response, occupying their minds while you wait for the extraordinary moment \u2014 that which they cannot anticipate.\u201d - Sun Tzu, The Art of War\r\nGet it? There's \"Art\" in the name. Like in Sword Art Online.\r\nYeah.\r\nSword Art Online II is considered by many to be worse than the first season, and in many places they're right. Guess what though? This guy right here likes it more because of personal preferences.\r\nI know, it's inconceivable.\r\nSAO II surprised me on many fronts. Most ofthe surprises were positive. Most.\\n\\n\r\n*SPOILERS FOR BOTH SAO AND SAO II, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED*\\n\\n\r\nFirst things first, you need to know my thoughts on the first season. I didn't like it all that much, now that I look back at it. I thought the Aincrad arc was fine, if you could overlook the blatant mistakes, but I couldn't do that in the Alfheim arc. Overall, most of the stuff happened with little to no reasoning to back it up, the characters were overlooked and barely touched upon, Kirito got way too powerful way too fast, and never gave up, Asuna turned into Princess Peach in the second half, the rape scenes triggered me immensely (don't remind me of that tentacle scene, for the love of God), Yui was a forced character that I liked, though at times it was pretty clear that they were trying to push this \"family\" idea way too hard. There were a few more mistakes, but I'm not about to write a review on that, so I'll move on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nThis time around we get three arcs, though one is pretty much a filler.\\n\r\nFirst one revolves around Gun Gale Online, which is an MMOFPS. A guy named Death Gun is shooting people, which somehow causes them to die in real life. Kirito gets peer pressured into stopping him by a guy that works in the virtual world danger prevention department, or something like that. Where was he in the last season? Oh, he was there, but we only see him in flashbacks here. The author pretty much adds shit that never happened into the first season, because of plot convenience.Same thing with the nurse, that supposedly treated Kirito when he was in the game. Before he enters however, we get a chance to meet the main grill for this arc: Sinon. More on her, later. We get a couple of backstory episodes, which are fine. They at least try to build up character, and it worked for me. After that Kirito finally joins the game, in which he looks like a girl for reasons. He randomly meets Sinon, who of course thinks he's a girl, and they go shopping for the big tournament that's coming up. But Kirito doesn't have any money. So he gets them by becoming Jesus-kun.\\n\r\nFor the first time in the series I was actually pissed off by how overpowered he is. Sure, there was a lot of moments where I almost cracked, but this was.... bad. Kirito, who supposedly never played this game before, is able to dodge bullets at will. He got the money by beating a game in which a machine shoots bullets randomly. Apparently this game is pretty much unbeatable, but not for Kirito.\\n\r\nAfter that, he becomes a jedi, drives on a bike that is supposedly almost impossible to control, enters the tournament, sees Sinon strip and finally we get to see him in action.\\n\r\nHe wins, obviously, but in a way that made me laugh so hard, that I didn't think I can get angry at this anime anymore. Let me put it like this: Kirito enters a tournament in a FPS, and he wins by doing flips, slashing his opponents and reflecting their bullets with a lightsaber. Kirito is literally a jedi, but occasionally uses a gun, which you can consider his force power.\\n\r\nNow for the best part. After the first round, Kirito is approached by Death Gun himself. He recognized him, so of course that means that he must be from SAO! We are shown a few clips of all the people that Kirito met in the previous season. Of course, my instinct tells me that it will be one of them, so I was looking forward to figuring out who is hiding under the mask (Oh, I didn't mention, Death Gun is hiding under a mask, breathing heavily every once in a while. If you can't make the connection, you need to watch more Star Wars). But guess what? I couldn't. Why?\\n\r\nBECAUSE THE AUTHOR ADDED A SCENE TO THE FIRST SEASON AGAIN.\\n\r\nThis time it's a more serious problem though. Apparently, Kirito, Asuna, Klein and a group of knights assaulted the base of Laughing Coffin, the player killing guild from the first season, during their time in  Aincrad. In that assault, couple of knights died. Kirito kills a few of the murderers in rage as well. Death Gun turns out to be one of the survivors from that assault. Sure, it's a cool scene that gives Kirito a room to grow and all, but adding it in the second season is ridiculous. At this point it almost felt like everything that happened before was unimportant, because they could just add something to the story any time they wanted. \\n\r\nThis was the first triggering moment. I couldn't stand it. This felt like a bitch slap to the face of all the Aincrad arc fans, but since I didn't care about it all that much, I moved on hoping nothing like this happens again.\\n\r\nKirito eventually gets to duel Sinon. He walks up to her like a 90's movie star, with all her bullets flying past him, and after a short talk, he did something impossible once again and won.\\n\r\nAt this point I gave up on Kirito as a character. From this point on I just saw him as the infamous Jesus-kun.\\n\r\nDuring a break from the game, we get to see Sinon being pissed at Kirito, but a good friend of hers hugs her and confesses his love. I really didn't want to mention this guy, but it's necessary. Sinon pushes him back, for reasons I will discuss in the characters section. Before we jump back in we also witness Kirito confessing his flashbacks of killing people in game to the nurse, but I didn't care, because of the whole concept surrounding it.\\n\r\nThe main tournament - Bullet of Bullets - eventually starts. After a while Sinon teams up with Kirito. Death Gun kills another guy, and they try to hunt him down. They end up in a town, Sinon gets stunned, Kirito saves her, they try to run away, but they are being chased. Miss sniper can't shoot, because of trauma, but thankfully, one touch from Jesus-Kun makes her forget it.\\n\r\nThey end up in a cave. A few fan service scenes and a short talk later, Jesus Sherlock-kun uncovers the truth about the real life killings. It's actually quite smart and interesting, though still a bit unbelievable. Let's just say, that there is a high chance, that someone could see what was going down, after all somebody has to break into a house in order to commit the murder. After that, they come up with a plan. With only four people left, Kirito will act as a decoy, and Sinon will shoot the remaining guy and try to kill Death Gun. The first part miraculously works, but the second one only gets rid of the villain's  rifle, and the scope on her own gun.\\n\r\nNow, on to the biggest, most ridiculous finale of an arc I've ever seen.\\n\r\nKirito confronts Death Gun. He tells him that there is no way he'll win, because he doesn't know his name from SAO. A good old sword fight commences. Jesus-kun at first gets completely destroyed, but he finally recognizes him. He sees the red eyes on his mask. Yes, the ones he saw before, when he was standing right in front of him. Death Gun stops moving, but Sinon somehow manages to aim at him without a scope, from a ridiculous distance, at that exact moment, so Kirito can defeat the bad guy and come out victorious. He meets up with his companion and they die together from a grenade explosion. Sinon decided that it would be for the best if they would win together, but because she is scared that someone might be at her house, she reveals her house address to Kirito before ending it.\\n\r\nBut it doesn't end here. It gets worse. Much worse.\\n\r\nSinon wakes up, and a moment later someone is at her door. It's the guy that tried to hug her before. Turns out he's not only Death Gun's brother, but also a freak that wants to rape her. He threatens her with the syringe filled with deadly poison. She tries to run, but gets caught at the door. After that, Jesus-kun shows up to save the day, but he gets injected. Sinon hits the assailant in the head, and then we witness the Resurrection of Jesus-kun. Out of all the places on his body, he got injected in a place where an electrode from the hospital didn't fall off. Yes, he's not dead, but he was pretending to be in a state of agony for the dramatic effect just a second before that.\\n\r\nThis was the most triggering conclusion to a story I've ever endured. If not for Sinon, I think I would have actually dropped it. Thankfully, the next arcs weren't filled with this amount of noticeable plot conveniences for me.\\n\r\nAfter it all calms down, they present some Sinon moment and Kirito using a device that can make Yui feel like she's in the real world, through the use of cameras and some computer program. It makes sense, after all Kirito decided that he will study that stuff, and it's not unseen for a youngster to make a scientific discovery, so I can let that slide.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc is harmless, so I won't talk about it as much.\\n\r\nKirito, Asuna, Sinon, Lisbeth, Sillica, Suguha, Klein and Yui decide to go into a dungeon in Alfheim to obtain the strongest sword in the game. There is really not much to say, they just decide to complete a quest together. It's harmless, and has barely any impact on the entire story. At first I thought this would serve as an introduction for the Alfheim Cat-Girl Sinon in Alfheim, but it ended up being nothing much. Everyone had their little moment, and that's about it. I don't really understand why was this necessary, but it was okay.\\n\\n\r\nNow, at this point, the story was a two in my eyes. I praised it here and there, but some moments made me feel so bad, that I just wanted to get it over with. How did it get  a boost like this in just on arc? The answer is: Something different.\\n\r\nThroughout the entire SAO up to this point, the main thing that the creators kept focusing on, was the game. Here, we have a pretty much perfect correlation between the virtual world and the real world. It's not like this hasn't been touched upon in the series before (Sinon and Kyouji trying to escape into the game, trying to bring Yui into the real world) but this time it was much more effective. Sure, it made most of the same mistakes, but in some other areas, it made me wonder, how did the same person write the first arc, and this one.\\n\r\nFirst thing I noticed is the fact that the MC of these last few episodes is Asuna. THANK GOD. Kirito did all he could, the best way to utilize him at this point was exactly the thing they did - turning him into a side character.\\n\r\nBack to the story. A new challenger approaches.... I mean, some person is challenging strong people, and promising an unique sword skill in exchange. Not only that, but that mysterious swordsman..... DEFEATED JESUS-KUN! But don't worry, he was only defeated because he wasn't giving it his all, so that's fine. I swear, making Jesus-kun the best at everything needs to stop.\\n\r\nIn the real world, Asuna's parents, mostly her mother, want her to move to a different school, and stop going out with Kirito. This was handled surprisingly well and felt like an everyday family argument. It was stated that Asuna had not been in the greatest of relationships with her family before as well.\\n\r\nAsuna goes to take up the challenge in the game, turns out, the swordsman a girl. One intense battle later, Asuna is asked to join her party consisting of her guild members - \"Sleeping Knights\" - in order to beat a floor boss in Aincrad, and get their names written down on a certain stone wall.\\n\r\nAfter a test run with the boss, they realize that they being spied on in order to find the boss's weakness. They quickly come back to do it for real this time, but they aren't the first ones at the entrance this time. A group of 20 other people, just waiting for the rest of their teams, is blocking the way. Asuna and the team decide to fight, but a huge group of players appears behind them. Just as all hope is lost, Kirito wallruns in front of them and takes them on. JESUS-KUN IS BACK, AND HE IS GOING TO SAVE EVERYONE. Oh, and Klein's there too....\\n\r\nSleeping Knights beat the assholes blocking the way, defeat the boss, and go to celebrate in Asuna's house ingame. She asks to join their guild, and they refuse with sad expressions on their faces. In order to cheer everyone up, they go to check out that stone wall. Yuuki calls Asuna \"sister\", but when she points it out to her, she quickly logs out, acting pretty terrified while doing so.\\n\r\nThis is the point where the in game events start to connect more and more with the real world. Asuna doesn't know what's going on, but Kirito tells her to go to a certain hospital. This makes sense because of his studies as well. When she arrives there, she is faced with the horrible truth.\\n\r\nYuuki has a terminal illness. This was obvious to me, because of how she was acting, the guild getting disbanded and Yuuki's reactions, but the degree of pain that she felt, the sadness and despair she had to face made me tear up. She has AIDS, but while normally it isn't terminal, this time around it's a very specific type of AIDS. She has been struggling for 15 years, she had to move because other children made fun of her illness,  and after getting worse, she had to stay in bed all the time, watching her parents her sister and her friends pass away while she was also slowly dying, trying to live the fullest inside a virtual reality. Yuuki was brave enough to take part in a medical experiment, that caused her to stay inside the virtual world for three years, completely cut out from the real world.\\n\r\nSome may say that it's just piling up misfortune to force the viewer into crying, but I highly disagree. When someone in real life is faced with a similar situation, it often goes terribly as well. Sure, this is an extreme situation, this does not always happen, but I've seen such tragedies unfold before, and that made the impact even harder.\\n\r\nI want to mention the little moment I had after that scene. Everything just suddenly clicked: Yuuki's childish behavior, her being really serious only during fights, the image she had of herself inside her head looked like her younger appearance, instead of her current one. All that turned this one moment into one of my most memorable anime experiences. I have to give the creators praise for that.\\n\r\nGetting back on track now, Yuuki's one dream is to go to school again, so Asuna comes up with an idea to use the device that got Yui into the real world on her. Her dream comes true, enough said. Later on, we also see that the home she used to live in is going to be sold. The bond between Asuna and and Yuuki strengthen, but at this point everyone knew that the terminal illness will ruin the happy moments.\\n\r\nThanks to the Yuuki's strength to push on, Asuna also gathers strength to confront her mother about moving schools. She does so by showing her the virtual world that she found love in. Asuna reminds her of the parents she neglected because of work and prestige. Asuna ultimately gets the permission to stay at her school and go out with Kirito. Everything ends happily.\\n\r\nI wish.\\n\r\nWe get to see a few more happy scenes of Yuuki and all the characters we met in the series having fun. There's a little  of some tournament, in which Yuuki comes out victorious, defeating Jesus-kun again, but only because the time ran out, don't worry.\\n\r\nA few days later Yuuki's state is critical. She's dying. She wanted to spend her last moments in the real world, but when Asuna arrives at her side, she want to go back. In Alfheim, at the place where they first met, she gives Asuna her special skill, called Mother's Rosario. Pretty touching name, as few moments later it's revealed that she believed in God. She collapes, Asuna holds her head. A very memorable quote is present here, I feel obliged to bring it up: \"God would never put us through all this suffering if he didn't think we could bear it.\" She believed that this isn't anyone's fault. She took all the pain like an adult would.\\n\r\nHer guild arrives. Another really well directed and touching scene hits, as one of the members that used to be cheeky and smiley tries to be her usual self, but bursts into tears in the middle of the sentence out of nowhere.\\n\r\nTears started flowing down my face.\\n\r\nKirito and friends also arrive, followed by a crowd of players. Everyone bows for the best swordsman in the game.\\n\r\nYes, the drama was forced, yes, Yuuki was introduced just to die, but shit like this happens every day, it's not as over glorified, but every day you can meet a person with cancer, that's going to die soon. I could not look at this in the same way I look at all other deaths, if it's for that reason only. I've seen people die of cancer, I can't forget that. The whole scene was directed very well, but if you didn't care, it will look forced, I have no way to deny it.\\n\r\nAt Yuuki's funeral we see that one of her guild members is no longer in terminal condition and can attend it. Data from Yuuki's time in the machine is going to be used to help humanity, and the system that Kirito created will be  as well. Turns out that the device was created by Kayaba Akihiko, in a yet another attempt to make me sympathize with the villain that killed 4000 people.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like I need to mention a few lesser mistakes that I noticed. They didn't tamper with my enjoyment too much, but they were definitely there:\\n\r\nAsuna, Kirito, Sinon, Yuuki, and everyone lives in the same city. I don't know if this is just how the universe works, but I find it highly unlikely that there is just one town in Japan where people play MMO's. It was stated that players all over the world play them.\\n\r\nAsuna and Kirito's relationship was pushed aside to the point that it was barely noticeable. It's supposed to be the main reason why Asuna doesn't want to leave, but she doesn't even talk about it with him. I get it that she doesn't want to do it, but he should notice something's wrong even before the whole Yuuki situation. He's Jesus Sherlock-kun after all.\\n\r\nThey tried to hard to develop high stakes, especially in the second arc. \"There's only a sliver of light left, you have to hurry.\", \"Oh no there is only a half o a sliver...\" Stuff like that. Same thing with he first season, instead of health we have light.\\n\r\nThere is still no explanation how to character feel tired or cold, or how do they taste stuff. Does the brain send signals to the body? I guess so, the pain levels at the end of first arc would hint that, but what about fatigue? Why do they breath heavily after running down the stairs or stuff like that?\\n\r\nI find it hard to believe that a school girl was threatening someone with a real gun, and was willing to shoot scared Sinon with it. I can't understand why someone would be this stupid, what if the gun didn't have the safety lock was on? Would she just shoot and kill her in the process?\\n\r\nThere's a few more, but those are the most noticeable out of the lesser ones.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the first arc was a disaster, and the last one also didn't avoid mistakes, without the time skips the pacing felt better and a lot of scenes were directed in a way that was more believable than the ones in the first season. It's hard to tell if the story was better than before, but I preferred the second season personally. Maybe it's because of the \"forced\" drama, I'll never know.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7,5\\n\r\nNot much has changed from the first season, if something the action scenes looked a bit better, but that balances out with the horrible looking CGI floor from the opening and the first Sinon scene. The bosses CGI this time around as well, and it looked much nicer. It was flashier in a good way, and darker when it needed to be, especially in GGO. Really liked the art style there.\\n\r\nAnimation is stellar, there were no weird frames this time around, or they were hidden better. The movement looks like it should, the faces move in a more realistic way, as I mentioned, there was this one really great looking scene of the Sleeping Knights member bursting into tears.\\n\r\nAn improvement, a small one, but it's there. Seems like the budget helped in this area.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nOn the other hand, we have the recycled music. A lot of the tracks are just remixes, don't get me wrong, I like \"Light up your sword\" even more than I liked Luminous Sword, but it would be nice to hear a few more originals. When they're there though, they're not bad, and the original SAO had great music. I'd say that it's a downgrade, but by a small margin.\\n\r\nThe openings are great, I especially like \"Ignite\" because it captures the feel of an FPSMMO rather well. It mixes in some fantasy-like sounds like a violin, but mostly it uses a lot of electronic guitar. Great stuff, got me pretty hyped every time I heard it. \"Courage\" is also good, fits the slower pacing of the second half. I like both. The endings are nothing to write about though. They're fine at best.\\n\r\nI'm not the one to judge seiyuus, as I'm not sure what makes a good one, but Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as Kirito and Miyuki Sawashiro as Sinon make a great pair. They sounded great together. I wish we heard more dialogues from the two of them.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nThe cast didn't work well off of each other, but individually some of them could be fun. A few pairs worked well, like Kirito and Sinon, or Asuna and Yuuki. I'll go more in depth.\\n\r\nKirito - He's a failure. I'm sorry, but this time around even I couldn't justify him being an overpowered, bland character. I wouldn't say he was bad, but unlike in season 1, I had nothing to look forward to in terms of his development, nothing intrigued me about his future. There wasn't much to write about in the first season either, but here he turned into your generic MC, that had some pretty laughably stupid moments here and there. Sometimes it wasn't the fault of the character though, the author failed to give him a proper motivation and opted out by just adding a scene to the Aincrad arc. That led to his motivation being completely irrelevant to me. At some point I just gave up on him.\\n\\n\r\nAsuna - As an MC she works far better than Kirito does. She still had room to grow as a character, so I'm glad they chose to give her some more screen time in the second half. She was my favorite character from the first season because she could be a strong, independent love interest when needed. That was ruined a bit in the second half, but here she doesn't rely on Kirito all the time. She shows signs of independence once again, and I liked that. She wasn't clinging onto Kirito, which may have ruined their bond a little bit, but helped her develop. She went through a positive improvement in my book.\\n\\n\r\nSinon - I expected another Suguha, where the fanservice and wanting Kirito's virtual and real life body would be the only defining characteristics (Don't get me wrong, the fanservice was there, but it wasn't defining in my eyes), but instead I absolutely loved her character. She was cool in game, and seemed lost in the real world. She interacted with everyone in a fun way that never failed to entertain me. Her weapon of choice was awesome. I loved her designs in all areas. We got to see her at a certain point in her development, and ended at a strong point, that still leaves room for growth. Her backstory provided enough for me to care, and all the scenes with the guns later on showed that she is still afraid, but getting stronger. She had a few funny scenes too. Long story short: I love everything about her character. She is the only reason why I enjoyed the second half of the GGO arc.\\n\\n\r\nDeath Gun - A horrible villain, I'm still debating whether I found him worse than Sugou or not. He's like a Disney villain, he does bad because he's evil. Actually, I think that's an insult towards Disney, so I take it back. He's unlike any other villain, he doesn't have a motivation, he didn't do it because of vengeance towards Kirito, he just likes to kill people. His identity felt like a slap to the face. I hate him.\\n\\n\r\nKyouji - Don't even get me started. At least he has a motivation, I guess, that being wanting to be the best GGO player and being mad. I feel like they could have just made him into a cold blooded villain, instead of being mentally ill, because that rape scene looked disgusting, and not in a good way. To be honest, I was surprised by the reveal, but if I looked at the opening instead of just listening to it I could have figured him out.\\n\\n\r\nYuuki - A character apparently introduced only to die and force feelings down my throat. I think that's going too far. Just like Sinon, we get to see her at a certain moment in her development, more specifically at the end of it. There wasn't much room for her to grow, but she was a pleasant addition to the cast. Unlike Yui, her childish behavior was justified entirely, she simply didn't grow up because of her condition, and her calling Asuna \"sister\" has been built up and had a visible impact. Of course she's not perfect, and if someone won't like her instantly, they won't like her at all. I feel like I explained my reasons well enough before, so I'll end this here.\\n\\n\r\nKlein - The only side that I want to write about, because he was turned into a comic relief, and I found that to be a bad idea. I can't believe that someone thought that turning him into a guy desperately looking for a girl, even it's an NPC, is a good idea. It came out silly, but once again, not in a good way.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc expanded a bit on Leafa, Lisbeth and Sillica, but very little so I don't feel like I need to write about them.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast isn't strong, but in each arc I had enough to keep me invested. Sinon and Yuuki were the main reasons, but Asuna was a decent MC for the third arc. The rest ranges from meh (Lisbeth, Sillica) to annoyingly poor (Death Gun). Unlike parts of the story, I didn't hate any character to the point of me wanting to quit. I have many problems, but I wouldn't want any character gone, I'd just want them fixed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nThis is a weird case, because I usually rate the anime that triggered me this hard pretty low on enjoyment, but at the same time, I rate the anime that made me cry higher. Taking everything into consideration though, I enjoyed the GGO setting at the very least, Sinon is now one of my favorite characters, Yuuki's story was heartbreaking and it had a much better pacing. Other than the specific moments, nothing tampered with my enjoyment, while during the first season, I was constantly annoyed. Not to mention a few cool moments, like the fight between Death Gun and Kirito itself (not the conclusion), or Sinon's introduction. Seven seems fair.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nI don't really consider this season good, but I do consider it special in a way that's seriously hard to explain in just a few words. There were quite a few moments and characters that I didn't expect from a series that insisted on punching me in the face as a viewer. I would have never thought it would make me cry, or even care about anyone, considering that I found the first season not good enough to even continue watching the series straight away. It took me some time to get into it, but I think it was worth it. With that being said, I'm still mad about all the mistakes it did. I will not overlook them. Sure, this season gave me the strength to continue watching the series, but it still wasn't a good experience. The writer still pulls off mistakes that anyone who watched more than 10 anime could fix if they thought about if for longer than ten minutes. At times it felt as if the creator didn't believe in his project. The only thing  I have to say towards the people who made this, is:\\n\r\n\"Shut up, and take my six\"\\n\\n\r\nAs always, this is purely my opinion, and I encourage you to develop your own.",

            "content": "*Minor Spoilers*\r\nSo after re-watching this season again, I can admit that it is no masterpiece, but it does evoke a strong core with better characters and story-lines that the first season seemed to be missing entirely. Let me explain myself and redeem this anime.\r\nTo start, there are three \"arcs\" in this anime. You have Gun Gale Online, Caliber, and Mother Rosario. Gun Gale Online is a brand new VRMMO that introduces guns and mostly PVP. The story behind it is about a player who calls himself \"Death Gun\" and who holds the power to kill players in the game, just like how Sword Art wasdone. Kirito was summoned by someone who works for the government and who does research on VRMMO's. He asks Kirito to dive into Gun Gale Online and solve the mystery. That's basically the premise for Gun Gale, and well, it get's half of it right. To start, Gun Gale is my second favorite arc in the Sword Art Online series, mainly because they introduce a character who is by far the most interesting character in all of Sword Art Online, Sinon. Sinon has a very dark, but interesting enough backstory for her to impact what is going on while Gun Gale Online takes place. It all works in favor for what Kirito experiences during this time, but I feel like it was a bit cliche at times. The main problem I have with Sinon, and not as her character, but the fact that we have to get ass shots of her left and right. It just seems so degrading to do something like that to such a good and honest character to the show. In the end Kirito still holds the most power and seems totally OP, but this slowly degrades from there for him.\\n\\n\r\nThen we're stuck with the last two Arc's: Mother Rosario & Caliber. Caliber was basically a huge filler to show how badass Kirito is, even though we have already established that a million times over. And while it does have an honest story to it, it's rather boring. Now onto the best part of ALL Sword Art Online: Mother Rosario. While not spoiling much, it's a very tragic story about a girl named Yukki and her party who want to make it onto a giant plaque that is situated in ALO for their memories in-game. Asuna get's a solid back story here, and we get a very emotional ride as we see many things take place that Sword Art Online has never really shown. And honestly somewhat redeems Sword Art Online for me.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the art & sound. Both are done very well, and the foley and atmospheric sounds they use are phenomenal. But the scores are kinda stale and feel used.\\n\\n\r\nI know that many people dislike this series SOLELY because of Kirito, but I feel that he changes to be less of an ego-maniac, and more of a chill dude who becomes more balanced as the show progresses. Kirito from Sword Art Online, all the way to about the end of Caliber Arcs', seems to be way over-powered and unnecessary. While he does pose as a bad-ass, it just seems very unreal for someone to accomplish all of the things he does in these arc's. But this all changes slowly, as we start to see other players that are as powerful, or more powerful than he is. Asuna is the first person to demonstrate that, but we also see this with Sinon, Yukki, and many more characters who have an edge over Kirito. As for the other characters, Yui get's to be introduced to the real world, and we get to see how tech in this world evolves. Suguha & the lot don't really get more backstory, if any at all, but I feel that they will eventually delve into this later.\\n\\n\r\nSo all in all, this Anime is NOT as bad as people say. Sure it has problems, but re-watching it again about a year later, I can tell you that it evolves into something pretty unique toward the end. While there are many cliche moments and things that happen, it's not all bad, and actually kinda funny. I recommend you give this a try, don't give this a bad review just because everyone else says it's bad, give it a try.",

            "content": "SAO 2 - Even though it really doesnt have much in common with that name, tries to follow-up with our lovely Jesus-kun and his very decent harem in this by many unwanted continuation of by many considered great first half of SAO 1. If you expect another original setting and promising ideas like from first half of SAO 1, you will be dissapointed, but still overall it keep some quality that makes this show still watchable, even though story wont stuck in your head for more than you watched it unfortunately.\r\nLight spoilers...\r\nStory - 4\r\nDont expect any miracles here - It's fanfiction level of writting, alot of dumb one-liners and overall lack of any major point of entire season as whole. The thing is that main driving force in SAO 1 was that everything was \"real\" - you died in the game, you are dead for good. SAO 2 never reached that feel of constant fear, it just tries it by dumb \"you cant log off while in tournament\" which is nonsense considering the world now knows better after SAO incident. \\n\r\nSo first story arc actually starts pretty promising - new VR game - steampunk setting and new problem - some guy cosplaying Darth Vader is having gun that apparently can kill players in real life. Nonsense, right ? So let's call Jesus-kun, a.k.a. Kirito, the underaged kid to solve these murders because that's how things in Japan works I guess... Anyway, later it turns up that things were much simplier. Kirito finds himself in the GGO as a female looking avatar (because reasons) then runs into his new harem member n.5564. Despite anime tries a lot to care about this harem girl and their relationship, adding a lots of teasing, and most of the time it actually works - the problem is - we have been over this over and over. With Asuna, who is now Kirito's girlfriend and where pretty much romance progresion died in SAO. You knew from the begining of the second part of SAO 1 and so as here that it wont go anywhere with these harem girls for one use. First act ends with Sinon joining harem fanclub, end thats where her part in the whole story ends - just an another girl that comes after Asuna. She did her part as simple emotional bait.\\n\r\nAnd the main vilan ? I have to give credit to creators, I had some good laugh over there (if that was the intention).\\n\\n\r\nSecond act is just a filler, doesnt even worth watching, just so MC can be even more OP as he already is.\\n\\n\r\nThird act is a strange one. It heavily plays on melodrama, so it depends if this your cup of the tea or not. I think melodrama can be done well if is not overused, not where it shoudn't be or where we dont care about characters enough, and this it that case. It's really nice to see different MC for a change - Asuna. The entire plot is about her meeting up with one unknown group of players that really want the beat the boss and \"they wont be much around after spring\" so they want to do it ASAP. You know something is not right after these \"subtle\" hints, and you will see the \"plot twist\" from mile away. I really dunno about this, it just feels kinda out of the place, really forced, just for them to introduce this one character to just later... also there is this sub-plot revolving about Asuna and her mother relationship, pretty generic \"do what we want from you, it's for your best\" done over and over. Thats it. Also Jesus gets his ass beaten so its not that bad part, it had it's moments, also yuri baiting. \\n\r\nBut same goes for first arc. There are good moments, but overall anime just feels all over the place like one gaint messy epilogue to SAO 1 which doesn't know where to go.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound - 8/9 \\n\\n\r\nYeah, you cant deny the production quality of this anime. Both beautiful backgrounds of steampunk GGO and amazing musical score makes this really a glorified fanfiction.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 4\\n\\n\r\nLets start with the our savior - Kirito. Once again (except third act) he is a perfect human being with his own harem, with super skills that comes without much efford, etc... Only change is that the writer tried to give him PTSD, but the result is dull and forced since we have seen him before pretty OK with his past. But anime needed something for him with he can relate to Sinon - therefore sudden delayed minor PTSD that washes away like his harem member into background.\\n\\n\r\nSinon - introverted girl, having some dark memories from the past, with real PTSD, being bullied in school and having that  o n e  nice guy (hahah). But she is overall fine and interesting, enough for you to care about her. The problem is that after her work for plot is done, she is put away into harem storage room, where she wont get any more screentime to conclude her relationship and character.\\n\\n\r\nAsuna - Not much to write here. She only acts as girlfriend in act one and in act three she is pretty much blank character, portlayed only as that girl that cares, from who's perspective we are watching the melodrama. They trying also for some character development with her, but it doesnt working very well.\\n\\n\r\nKlein - comedic relief\\n\\n\r\nHarem storage room - bunch of girls left over just being in the background\\n\\n\r\nNice guy - Sinon's fedora guy, that actually went too far\\n\\n\r\nGman - Japan's version of evil gman that is using 17 years old kids to do his job\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\\n\r\nIts glorified fanfiction with big production value. It's decent anime to watch when you are looking for something simple and you don't have many options.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 6 \\n\\n\r\n+ Great audiovisual\\n\r\n+ Sinon and Asuna\\n\r\n+ Good moments in first arc and its promising setting\\n\r\n- Cheap MC \\n\r\n- Story all over the place\\n\r\n- Most of the cast unused and left over",

I've seen so many anime that I've run out of popular ones to watch, so I finally decided to check this off my list and write a short review.\\n\r\nI'll start off with saying that if you didn't like the first season and don't like the MMORPG scene then Sword Art Online 2 probably isn't for you, and the same can be said for this short review since I'll be writing on the assumption you've seen and liked the first season and also like MMORPGs.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot summary on MAL to SAO2 really only applies till the end of episode 14.

Episodes 1-14 are in Gun Gale Online (GGO) which has a more serious atmosphere and where you get to see Kirito (Kirigaya) do his typical badass stuff.\\n\r\nBasically what happens is some guy is able to kill people in the real world in GGO, someone with the government is assigned to deal with it, luckily this person is acquaintances with Kirito through the SAO incident, the government man goes to Kirito since he knows Kirito is experienced with the virtual world, and gives Kirito a job to stop Death Gun (the guy killing people in real life through the game).\\n\r\nIt's a gun type MMO but Kirito chooses a light saber type weapon. A lot of people complain about this and how it's crazy how Kirito can just run at people shooting him and knocking their bullets out of the air, but it honestly made sense to me. All the virtual worlds are based on the same \"world seed\" from SAO which makes it possible for people to convert their accounts over and retain their skills/levels. And as we all know, Kirito was a badass in SAO and ALO, being a speed demon among other things. There could also be other factors like GGO using different variables for bullet speed than in real world. You see it happen all the time in gun games. It makes the game more fair.\\n\\n\r\nThe story for the first half was pretty nice. I was entertained and we even get introduced to a new character called Sinon (Shino). The anime kept focusing on both her and Kirito but it worked out pretty well. The other half (episodes 15 and up) was a nice reintroduction to all the characters. It was like a planned goodbye to us. At the end the feels were real, man.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was more or less the same old. They did have pretty CGI though.\\n\\n\r\nSound was normal. Voice actors, the music, all of it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters could have been better, especially when it came to Kirito. It felt too forced on him when they were trying to make him \"grow\" but it's easy to ignore since we already know how much growing he did in the first season. Shino and Asuna felt more realistic though. They overcome their hardships instead of trying to rely solely on other people, and grow as a result.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Sword Art Online 2, same as I did for Sword Art Online. Maybe it's because I enjoy MMORPGs and am hoping for virtual reality that is as advanced as it is in this anime to become real. That and I just love badass main characters that take everyone by surprise with how powerful they are after the enemy underestimated them. Guess that's why Overlord and Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu are my favorite \"overpowered MC\" type anime.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr if you liked Sword Art Online then you'll like this second season since the first arc focuses on Kirito being a badass with a light saber in a gun MMO to find a murderer and the last arc is a beautiful farewell to us from all the characters we know and love.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online is the worst anime of all time. I hated the first one with a passion, and it is only thanks to my friend's recommendation that I decided to watch the 2nd one. To my great surprise, I was enjoying it quite a bit at the start.\r\nIn the second season of Sword Art online, we are introduced to a character named Sinon, who actually had some depth. Keyword: HAD. She is completely relatable in the sense that she's bookish and traumatized in real life but turns into a complete badass in a game. While this is not a character trait unique to Sinon(and is in fact quite a cliche), she has a personality and an interesting history that would have been enough to carry a bad anime across the line of mediocrity. Hell, give her some character development, she might even make an otherwise mediocre concept/anime \"good.\" She would've been a good lead. She was doing a good job being the protagonist.   \\n\\n\r\nThen Kirito showed up. And everything went to absolute Shit.  \\n\\n\r\nAll her character developments are abandoned. The story of how Sinon overcome his fear of men and gun turned into the story of how Kirito got himself another waifu. And the things that he did with Sinon, the things that he said, actually made me feel uncomfortable. He was pretty much flirting with Sinon and cheating on his girlfriend, but somehow it's okay because it's Kirito. \\n\\n\r\nHe's the hero. You're supposed to like him. He can do no wrong.\\n\r\nAt this point, I'm sure the only time I'm ever going to enjoy Sword Art online is when Kirito either straight-up dies or they do a spin-off without Kirito coming to save the day every damn time in some stupid manner.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with sword art online wasn't the premise or the story or the art or the music or the bizarre things that occurred. The biggest problem with Sword Art Online is Kirito.  Always has been, and always will be.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say Sword Art online 2 is a bad anime. Not the worst anime of all time. There are some enjoyable moments, a decent new heroine who has an interesting (by SAO standard) backstory, but when the show throws everything out of the window just so the old protagonist can get the girl in the end, it's doomed to be a less than mediocre anime that should be watched by no one.",

            "content": "I didn't mind the first season of SAO but when I watched this season I quickly got a bad taste in my mouth.\r\nStory \r\nIn the first half the story was alright (but I'm leaving the stupid character for later)\r\nThere did bring back the death element but this time only one character has the ability to kill. Also there was no tension, no character that the main has known has been killed which, in turn, killed the tension, if they had killed a character like Liz or Klein in the first series then there *may* have been tension. Also there is no way Kirito is thatgood in a game he just started playing, with a sword, IN A SHOOTER! Also the prediction lines are the dumbest things in a shooter, if you want a mechanic like that, make the bullets slower, if you have prediction lines, all you have to so is move out of the way and don't get me started on the \"predicting the prediction line.\" But that was how it should have been done, possible to dodge but not telling the exact travel that the bullet will take.\\n\r\nWhat was with the side story? It was a pointless quest for a sword (not like Kirito has enough) and nothing impactful happened, it was filler... On a series that didn't need filler.\\n\r\nThe last arc, which is the most praised, is also bad.\\n\r\nThe new characters didn't get developed (which is I found throughout this season) and it made the arc a little flat, I didn't get to know these characters well so why should I care about them? I also didn't like how the arc was focused on Asuna, it should have been spent on the new characters. I think it only gets praised for getting away from Kirito.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nIt's A-1 pictures, the art is going to be good.\\n\r\nHowever, I do want to talk about the design of the maps in the first arc because I feel like that has to do with the art.OK so, in a shooter, you need room to run about, but whenever there was a fight it felt really confined. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nI haven't heard an anime with bad sound so I have nothing to compare it to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nKirito is still OP as heck, maybe even more OP than in the first season because he didn't get into a Beta to understand the mechanics.\\n\\n\r\nSinon was a terrible character, she was only introduced to have someone to help Kirito for the first episode and then be a fan-service girl on Kirito's arm with a \"tragic backstory.\"\\n\\n\r\nSinon's friend only had a personality when he was trying to rape Sinon.\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters from the last arc could've been interesting characters if it took the episodes from the filler and used that time to develop these characters but we didn't get that, instead we get a story focused on Asuna.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall\\n\\n\r\nThe first season I enjoyed watching even if it wasn't the best anime but I would've dropped this season really quickly if I didn't hear that the last arc was good, which I disagree with.\\n\r\nI did not enjoy myself when watching this, instead I was having the opposite of enjoyment, which is a first for me.",

            "content": "I rewatched both seasons over the past month; most of my viewing was done within the past 2 weeks since I was busy earlier on.  I still loved the series even after a few months went by.  I like how the show doesn't completely ignore games and stuff that are brought up in season 1.  The Fairy dance arc is my least favorite arc, but it's still very good and Alfheim is the center for so many things later on in the story.  Gun Gale Online was a fun thing to experience from the show.  The Phantom Bullet arc broughtup the Laughing coffin raid that we didn't see in season 1 and the creator did a good job at connecting events in GGO to that previous SAO event.  \\n\\n\r\nSinon was definitely a good addition.  Kirito needed a friend who wasn't another SAO survivor and she was strong (in the game anyway) and fiery and it fit her role perfectly.  I loved the action and I enjoyed seeing Kirito adapt his in game sword skills in order to use them in a gun game and succeed.  One of my favorite scenes is when he cut Sinon's hecatete bullet in half.  They also made a good and took care of Death Gun. Kirito also helped bring Sinon out of her shell in the real world.\\n\\n\r\nThe Calibur arc was short, but enjoyable.  It was nice to see a story arc based around Excalibur after it was previously introduced and I really enjoyed the boss fights in the arc.  The Mother's Rosario arc was great too.  Asuna is my favorite female in the show so I like how they showed more development for her.  The addition of Yuki and the sleeping knights just added some story drive to the the arc and the guild had a huge impact on Asuna.  Seeing the way her mother acted at first helped explain why she had an aggressive attitude sometimes.  For how much I love the Aincrad arc, I think season two was better in the fact that every arc served a purpose; the Fairy dance arc did, but some of it was unnecessary.  Due to how great the Aincrad arc was though, I'd say both seasons are equally amazing.  \\n\\n\r\nThe music is always fantastic along with the art as well.",

Though like I am allowed \"A few sentences for general information is alright,\"  I will reiterate and say that the best review is to be written by yourself. Go into everything with an open mine and I guarantee you with thoroughly enjoy it. \r\nSo from the Story perspective. There is nothing I can find wrong it at all honestly, because if you take it as it is, and not comparing it to any manga or other works, it just shows the life of a gang ofVRMMO players. Although I do love how the story plays off this. In this series the only thing it does is add more of a filler story to the original story, but then again what more can you expect from SAO. It does play well off the first series though, if you can imagine the correlation between the two and the antagonist in this series, compared to the protagonists and how they also relate/find themselves. The last 4 episodes did throw me off of the main romance but were actually a good tie in to really conclude everything in this series, and progress the character development a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of course was beyond amazing. If anything you can pull from this is that there is almost always action, and the animations are pristine to say the least. Not to mention the backgrounds and sceneries and how they fit into the mood of the story itself. \\n\\n\r\nSound is as it should be. The character voices were on point as well as the normal sounds from the environment and reactions from the characters in it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was great. This is actually the only thing I had a problem with as I stated with the last 4 episodes. In my personal opinion I would have liked to see more of the male and female lead romance, but as I said the story ties that in a knot. So on the character side for once I can say that I absolutely loved the male lead. He is exemplary of me and who I am as a gamer and person as a whole. And as many characters as they bring into and remove from this, I am surprised at how many feelings I have accrued for each of them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment was quite simply that. Pure enjoyment on a scale greater than the one I can use to grade it here. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, a highly UNDERRATED anime. Because I am allowed to give my opinion on this as it is a review. From the very beginning, the story and visuals have worked together to make beyond a fantastic world. As the Characters really make it seem like it could be real itself, being that they are all realistic in their personality and situations. And as usual the production companies behind this have underlying correlations, meanings, and messages throughout that are intelligent beyond it being a normal anime. Keep an open mind and you will enjoy this.",

            "content": "The second season of SAO. I don't know why they call it that since SAO ended at episode 14. I also don't know what evil force compelled me to watch the second season since the first season was terrible. This season is slightly better than the first one but it is still terrible.\r\nWARNING: SPOILERS\r\nThe story is divided into 3 arcs. The first story arc takes place in a game called Gun Gale Online. The government sends 17 years old kirito(and not a trained investigator) to investigate a murderer named Death Gun who can kill people by shooting their in-game avatars.\r\nWe are introduced to a newcharacter called Sinon. Her first appearence was as a sniper while the camera continuously focused on her ass. She is afraid of guns because of an incident. So to overcome her fear she plays GGO. This is really illogical. If i was afraid of dogs, I wouldn't go to a pet shop from time to time to overcome my fears. However, she soon becomes part of Kirito's harem and immediately becomes forgotten as the first arc ends.\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc itself seemed promising. Thaere should have been gun fights and some real strategy. But Kirito uses a freaking lightsaber to cut through bullets and overpowering the enemy. What the hell? One would have to be a god to actually time a slash and hundreds of bullets coming together at once. But Kirito does it with ease. As if he wasn't overpowered enough.\\n\\n\r\nIt also has a nasty habit of repeating everything that happened few minutes before in words. Why the hell would I want to hear the things I have already seen. It does nothing but drag out an episode and make it REALLY boring. It ends with yet another deus ex machina but thankfully, it wasn't as outrageous as the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThe second arc revolves around Kirito and gang trying to save Alfeim Online from being deleted. Apparently if they do not complete a certain quest it would result in the deletion of the game(whaaat!!!). I have given up on logic and common sense at this point so nothing to do. Klein gets some screentime though which is always a good thing. \\n\\n\r\nThe third arc is about Asuna making some new friends online and struggling with her parents. And no Kirito(YAS!!!). It's full of cheap melodrama where the anime tries to make the viewer cry by introducing a new character and giving her AIDS. We are supposed to fell sad for someone who I don't know anything about other than the fact thaat she has AIDS. It was cheap and forcd and didn't work at all.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the fact that it was slightly better than the first season it doesn't have anything else going for it. It was still bad, but not offendingly bad as the first season. It's as if the writers knew they were stupid and didn't try to hide the fact anymore.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who watched the first season unless he's a SAO  fanatic. It's still a stupid waste of time.\\n",

Perhaps I'm too sentimental unsuited for my age, but I suppose that's just what I require to find something worth of substance nowadays.\r\nSAO2 hardly fits this rather stringent criterion with the sole exception of the last story arc of the season. If nothing else watch the Mother's Rosario storyline to immerse yourself in the almighty feels. The near entirety of the season prior to Mother's Rosario is a nondescript experience, yet SAO2 saved the best for last.\r\nIronic in thatI was most looking forward to the GGO arc prior to the start of the second season, yet it was an ephemeral friendship that made it all worthwhile. \\n\\n\r\nDon't let my overall score of 7 fool you. This season of SAO is arguably worse than its predecessor and I wouldn't rate it past a 5 without Mother's Rosario. That story arc is the only thing worth watching in my humble opinion and you would be remiss in neglecting to do so. \\n\\n\r\nPS: Do forgive the bizarre and somewhat implausible series of events in the final episode. Maybe their internet is a better place compared to our own cesspool?",

            "content": "*Spoilers to be expected*\r\nIn both defence and critique of Sword Art Online II's GGO arc.\r\nMy first review on MAL and I'm attempting to find ways to defend Sword Art Online. Whatever has my life come to?\r\nI want to begin this review by saying that I really did not enjoy the first season of this anime. There are already hundreds of opinionated reviews and arguments as to why someone would consider the first season to be hot trash so I don't see the point in going over them here. I'll only be looking at the first 13 episodes in any depth during this review too asI believe there were things that were done right in this section of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThere were two major problems that needed to be dealt with in order for season 2 to not also crash and burn like a zeppelin filled with crushed dreams and despair. Hell there were hundreds of problems overall but lets focus on the two largest ones. Our lord and saviour Kirito and character consistency. Did they manage to salvage these aspects of the show?\\n\\n\r\nShort answer: Sadly, no.\\n\r\nLong answer: I can't say they at least didn't try.\\n\\n\r\nKirito is still portrayed as daddy jesus-kun however there is an attempt, in a really shoehorned way, to make it look like he can somehow do something wrong and regrettable. This is presented in the form of a raid that was carried out during the events of the first season against a guild awkwardly named \"Laughing Coffin\" whose sole intent was to murder simply because they could. As righteous an endeavour as this was for Kirito (praise be) he ends up having to kill some of its members and thus their real world counterparts. I understand that this was the writer trying to show that Kirito is not perfect and yeah it does become relevant later in the plot but it's just so lazily shoehorned in it's hard to really appreciate. He's still an invincible Mary Sue with no real grounding or proper inner dialogue. While at least they tried to actually characterise him and it doesn't hurt, it's not massively effective either. Although I may be crucified for saying this there are some moments that actually make him seem rather badass while also showing him as having vulnerabilities, although being the second coming of christ you know he is never really in any danger.\\n\\n\r\nWe are introduced to a new character, a sniper class in the gun focused MMO Gun Gale Online (who names these?), named Sinon. This is where the first arc of SAOII shines in my opinion. We're shown a character with a genuinely tragic backstory, a character with motives and shortcomings who seeks to overcome her problems. Sinon is the character that an anime like SAO needed to make it enjoyable. While top of her class she still has flaws and isn't able to pull Deus-ex-Machinas out of a magic hat like the one true lord Kirito. She has moments of true badassery and is built up as someone who can take care of themselves within the online world. I would have loved if they'd somehow managed to exclude Kirito from the first arc and have it entirely focused on her with a decent cast of supporting characters but this is SAO and we can't proceed without our master Kirito. For this first arc as well there is little to no romantic interest between her and the chosen one Kirito.  Instead they develop a relationship as rivals who grow to have a mutual respect for one another which is a refreshing change of pace. \\n\\n\r\nSinon has an intense fear of guns due to an event that happened during her child hood and seeks to, by playing a game devoted to firearms, put that fear behind her. Confronting a fear head on, although it may seem illogical at first, is a proven method to tackling a deeply nested trauma. Albeit it is a very slow and painful process which is not shown here due to this being a primarily action focused anime but it does bare some semblance of sense. Her childhood trauma also makes her moments of weakness more believable. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately we must remind ourselves that this is SAO and we will see close ups of her ass in at least 20 or so shots because being a character with some depth does not exclude you from being exploited as fanservice, later becoming part of Jesus-kun's rampant Harem train and losing said depth. By the time the second arc begins we seem to completely forget about Sinon's struggles and see her demoted from a strong, badass heroin to just another piece of ass that follows Kirito around. He also does the \"let me impart thine wisdom and save you my child\" thing during one of her biggest moments of despair which is to be expected by this stage but still very eye rolling none the less. As the ass shots ramp up towards the end of the GGO arc we begin to see SAO's latent sexism shining through in all its ugly glory. A girl who has been shown to be of keen whit and was once capable of developing her tactics on the go will inevitably require Kirito's help. I sadly don't see that changing any time soon either. Needless to say this all made me incredibly annoyed and had the effect of making the entire first half of this season utterly pointless.\\n\\n\r\nLooking more at the positives the plot of the first arc is set up very nicely. There is the \"IF YOU DIE IN THE GAME YOU DIE IN REAL LIFE\" clich\u00e9 but this time there seems to be only one player capable of enacting this vengeance in the form of our main villain. Kirito's reason for deciding to enter GGO is out of curiosity as to whether or not this villain exists and a desire to find affirmation that a player cannot be killed from within a game. While others have complained that this reason is contrived I can sort of understand why this might be all the motivation Kirito (praise be his name) needs. He survived a similar scenario and most likely feels it's his duty to put a stop to anything similar that would arise. It's not the most original plot but the narrative stays focused and delivers where it is supposed to\\n\\n\r\nWhat I mentioned prior also makes the villain actually somewhat threatening and intimidating. We are also are left in the dark about who he is for most of this story arc making him all the more frightening when he seems to recognise Kirito. Unfortunately he has the craptastic name \"Death Gun\" which takes away slightly from his menacing aura. As for design, it may be a little goofy (scary skeleton man in a cape, see He-Man) the way his dialogue is delivered along with considering what he is capable of do make him a menacing presence.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the more visual side of things It looks fantastic as did the first SAO. The cryberpunk, gritty nature of GGO makes for a welcome change of scenery from what we would have gotten used to in the first season. The animation is also very well done, especially during the fight scenes, as is to be expected. The dialogue is pretty awful but does have some rather rare high points.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story is told far more coherently than in the prior season, like I have said many times in this review already, this is SAO and\\n\r\nthe plot does leave itself with many gaping holes. Anyone who plays MMORPGs will immediately notice the flaws and logic gaps in GGO's design. Most of these have been glazed over with lazy writing which was a huge issue with the franchises first iteration. The villain's motives are made overly complex and Kirito's brief confrontation with his morals is quickly swept aside and only used as a way for him to have some sort of convenient emotional connection to Sinon for the purpose of driving the plot forward. However if you don't include the amount of pointless exposition then you can at least say that it's mostly devoid of filler. The goal is stop Death Gun from committing any more murders and what this story arc shows are the steps that our main characters go through in order to achieve that goal. Not too much more and nothing less. \\n\\n\r\nIn summery within the first arc we get a reasonably well developed heroin whom we (or at least I) find ourselves caring for, an awesome setting very different from the prior season, a genuinely intimidating villain, great visuals, animation and the believably high stakes of capturing a murderer before he is able to strike again. I honestly believe that the first half of this anime is worth watching. Is it a masterpiece? Hello no. Is it good? Not as consistently as I would like but it has some moments that are gratifying. I really want there to come a time when I no longer find myself using \"after all this is SAO\" to excuse the franchise's many short comings. It's as frustrating to me as it is to many others that something with so much potential makes so many bad decisions. This season was better than the first but the franchise still has a long way to go before it could be considered great.\\n\\n\r\nNot a must watch but a decent enough story to keep you interested for 13 episodes. \\n",

            "content": "*very minor spoilers abound*\r\nOh Sword Art Online II...the franchise started with so much promise and then it felt like the some executives wanted to milk the crap out of it. If you've played the PSP and Vita games on top of watching SAO II, certainly feels like it too.\r\nThe season is split into three distinct arcs.  The first arc Phantom Bullet was the longest and by far the worst for several reasons.  It wasn't even good for TV show standards and I'll get into that later.  The second arc Excalibur was certainly refreshing after 14 grueling episodes but lacked substance.  Thankfully,it was short, but it felt more like an OAV.  The third arc Mother Rosario really made up for putting up with barely watchable filler.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nPhantom Bullet: 1/10.  It's a mystery and sets you up with a quiet, kinda nerdy, tsundere-type recluse girl named Sinon that has this tragic secret, and she's the main character (not Kirito).  Problem is that you have zero reason to like Sinon.  If the viewer can't like the protagonist or get into their world, the show will be very difficult to swallow and that's one of the things that happen here.  They try to develop her character by constantly rehashing her tragic past.  By constantly, it's like an annoying fly that keeps buzzing around you and you can't kill it.  You know it's there but you don't need 14 episodes to constantly remind you about it if she's not going to actually effectively do anything about it.\\n\r\nWhen Kirito is re-introduced, it is executed TERRIBLY.  He reminisces of his time in SAO several times and this event that you never saw (but insert flashback sequences, again done several times in the series) and rather than just touch upon it, it becomes a very disjointed and rushed flashback that you really can't sympathize for Kirito.  Yet, the series feels like they HAVE to remind you about it constantly, paired with Sinon's tragic past.  It becomes quite literally an emo-fest.  In the 14 episodes, I can only really recall 3 matches.  So what happens in the rest of the episodes?  Talking, emo flashbacks, more talking, planning, flashbacks, Asuna worried, flashbacks, talking.\\n\r\nIn short, the pacing is awful, the story telling is non-existent, there's little actual character development that really gives you actual substance that tells you something new about the character (you know a good amount about Kirito already, what's shown is just an insignificant slice that honestly, gets blown up into something unreasonable), and Sinon, the main protagonist is not portrayed to be likeable at all.\\n\r\nWorst of it?  The ending to the arc falls completely flat.  You just don't care.  There's no twist, there's no big surprise, it's feels like \"another day in the office\" sort of ending.  I personally celebrated when I finished it.\\n\r\nExcalibur : 5/10\\n\r\nAdventures in Alfheim Online.  If you're into Nordic lore, this might interest you.  Otherwise this short series really could've been made into an OAV.  Nothing of significance happens to move the story along, and it really brings out the harem-ness of this show (again, I really don't get along with harem shows).  It's neat to see some misadventures in ALO for once without Kirito on some focused mission but it's almost like filler episodes.  Again, it's still refreshing to see this after trudging through the first arc.\\n\r\nMother Rosario : 8/10\\n\r\nThis is really what this franchise needed.  It puts Asuna in the forefront and puts Kirito on the backburner.  I wasn't sure how to feel about this at first because most of the time, these kinds of episodes tend to be dull and filler material.  On the contrary, they invested a lot of time in combing through Asuna's personal life, why she dives, how it affects her personal life, and how she as a person can make a difference in other people's lives, including her own.  You get some beautiful moments of story telling and cuts right to the chase of Asuna standing up for herself rather than relying on Kirito or someone else.    This is an example of how you can do character development well.  Still not perfect, but these last episodes saved SAO II for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt : Still great art, action scenes are done well, lighting and backgrounds have got some detail and not cheapened.  Problem is that they're still using a lot of recycled art and recycled scenes.  Character designs and costume designs are well done, wouldn't expect much less.\\n\\n\r\nSound : Only until the last few episodes was I actually a fan of the music.  The opening and closings for the first arc felt like your generic anime opening.  Second and third arc was much better.  The closings, again nothing unique but it's nice to have LiSA on the last closing song.  Very nice song as well and fitting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : Again, we don't need another harem anime.  We don't need a reminder that Kirito is naive and clueless when it comes to women and we don't need to see the girls constantly pouting at him.\\n\r\nThe first two arcs have virtually zero substantial character development.  You really have little reason to care about Sinon, why they needed 14 episodes to move only inches forward with her is beyond me.  However the last arc again fleshes out characters decently well, well enough that I started caring about Asuna and the new character Yuuki.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : If masochism is your thing, you'll love the first two arcs.  The last arc was worth it but if you're OK not being a completionist, watch the last two arcs and SAO II will leave a much better taste in your mouth.\\n\\n\r\nOverall : I enjoyed the first series very much, including ALO (despite a lot of naysayers), thus I feel that I can tolerate a lot. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the first half of SAO II was by far one of the worst shows I've ever seen, period, ever, period.  An episode of Spongebob Squarepants has more substance than the entire first half.  If they shortened it to maybe 4-6 episodes, it would've been bearable.  That way, all the useless bantering, tragic emo moments (quite literally, 30 seconds of staring at a gun going emo with shots of red blood cells going...somewhere, I still don't know) that keep repeating could've been cut down to just the meat of the mystery story.  In fact, Aniplex should've just made the first arc into a short OAV series to at least explain some of the events that happened in the SAO world that they were unable to show due to the limited amount of episodes ordered.\\n\\n\r\nBecause I actually was a sucker and watched all 24 episodes of this, my initial overall rating was originally a 3.  Because I did watch all 24 episodes, the last arc made me feel like SAO franchise could have a great future if the producers knew what makes for a good story telling experience for anime rather than make an adaptation and string the viewer along for a very long ride just to bring them nowhere.  If you choose to watch this, take the first half with a grain of salt.  In fact, seriously just skip it all together and use those precious wasted hours in your life for a new hobby...like knitting or LARPing, I don't know.",

            "content": "Well I dropped the hell out of this anime. I was really looking forward to seeing it, especially after being underwhelmed by the second half of the original SAO, but SAO II didn't change things. I'm pretty sure a lot of people are going to call me an idiot for giving this show such a crappy rating, but people you need to understand that SAO II ranks in the 1300s for a reason. With so much fanbase around SAO II, it makes it hard to believe that fans of this show watch any anime that's worth their time.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nA very generic plot. Kirito is huntingdown a muderer in another VR game. That's pretty much it. Yet, we have another fake love story featuring Kirito. So, how many times is Kirito going to get in suggestive relationships with other female teenagers? He already has a girlfriend, yet he still manages to get himself into incredibly awkward relationships with Lisbeth, Sinon, and even his own cousin, Suguha. The plot twist for the Gun Gale arc was cringingly predictable. I easily guessed everything that was going on like 3 episodes before we got down to the main battle between Kirito and Death Gun, and afterwards, I had to drop the anime because it was just way too unexciting to just sit and watch for a full review on MyAnimeList.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\r\nKirito was just being his usual self: a male character who's the smartest and one of the most badass characters in the show, the common anime hero (namely Naruto, Goku, Luffy, and tons others). Sinon was more interesting than Kirito, whilst seeing her backstory and struggle with her past, but like a said before, she's just another primary female character who won't get off of Kirito's nuts. From Kirito wrapping his hand around Sinon's waist to Sinon lying on Kirito's lap, you just knew that these two wanted to hit, regardless of both of them already having mates. The big mistake that the developers of SAO II made was trying to build a fanbase without use of a plot, like having Kirito spawning in Gun Gale as a female avatar, having Sinon slap Kirito when finding out he's a dude, which was very similar to when Asuna punched Kirito, and making long and awkward shots of Kirito staring directly at Sinon's ass and instantly figuring out something major to the main mystery of Death Gun. Is Asuna involved in this anime? I'm just gonna go on a line and say \"no, she really isn't\". I mean, of course she was in but she was left out so much that Sinon has practically taken her place as Kirito's girlfriend. Asuna's just there to support Kirito from a distance. You know what would've made things better? If Asuna joined in Gun Gale and caught Sinon lying on Kirito's lap in a cave and then breaks up with him. You might as well just eliminate her from the entire anime if she, supposedly being a major character, barely gets any screen time. Other characters didn't get much screen time, as well. It was all just about Kirito and Sinon, and that's all you need to know.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the stronger aspects of SAO II. It's not the most unique animation, going as far as something like Afro Samurai or Attack on Titan, but it still maintains very great detail in everything. The animation is overall very smooth, although it did slow down a lot in the fight between Kirito and Death Gun, which was a very underwhelming 1v1. Other fights scenes, though, are very well-animated, but incredibly short, which also was another huge fall point of the anime. So you guys make the side fights short as hell and you make the longest boss battle suck? That's absurd. Other than fight quality, the animation of SAO II is great.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nYet another strong point of SAO II. I found the OST of SAO II to be more appealing than the OST for the original, as some of the songs used in SAO are remixed to be more hybrid and high-tempo (most notably \"Gunland\", which is a remix of \"Swordland\"), which I love more than the traditional orchestra music. The theme song of SAO II is also a very good track, and I surprisingly like it more than the original theme. In most of the anime I watch, I hope to get some good music, and SAO II utilizes that trait.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall score: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the original SAO, SAO II was very underwhelming and boring to watch. With a reuse of innuendo, a small cast, and a setback on action sequences, SAO II is way to sloppy for me to even finish watching.",

They try to come up with bullshit reasons as to cover up the poor writing, creating situations that would never have been allowed to happen in real life. Sinon's character is annoying as she thinks of the game as if it were real and at the same time doing things that directly contradict the entire reason for playing the game in the first place. The government is portrayedas completely incompetent, having to turn to a teenager and not being able to do anything. The fight choreography is just atrocious, as fights in the Phantom Bullet Arc mostly all go like this: deflect all the bullets and go in for the kill. It's incredibly lazy. The three episode Excalibur \"arc\" is easily the worst arc in the series up to this point. Reki Kawahara doesn't even try to tell an actual story. Kirito and the others go on a quest in Alfheim Online to get a sword he won't ever use again because if they don't for some reason all the map data will be destroyed. The Mother's Rosario arc had potential and is actually passable, but offered so little to the story it doesn't even matter.",

            "content": "So, this second season of SAO...\r\nNo more death games, I'll summarize it as best as I can...\r\nA case of serial murder via a shooting MMO? Hmm interesting...\r\nSave the Aincrad/Alfheim world from fucking itself over with some Norse shenanigans? Um, not the best idea\r\nA side story featuring a character with terminal disease that is basically a feels and redemption process at the same time? Geez, way to mess with my hearts, bruh\r\nAnyway, I'll make this as simple as possible while detailing the best I can\r\nSTORY:\r\nThis is where nearly all the problems with this SAO season were:\r\nI'm not gonna lie, for the first half of SAO 2,the whole GGO plot seemed very lit, going into detail on how a seemingly headstrong and cold-hearted character in Sinon is actually one of the most mentally fragile characters I've ever seen. We also get some new light on how Kirito still feels a heavy burden from the \"sins\" of being forced to kill back in the Aincrad Arc. My problem with this plot is that it really just sets up Sinon to be infatuated with Kirito and be part of his friendzone. The good side is that she never really changed too much in terms of her personality like Asuna did. Also........the Star Wars gag is ubquitous, and then Traprito...but I'm not gonna divulge into that much more.\\n\r\nSecond part? The Excalibur Arc is completely useless, imo. At best, it showcases why Kirito decides to recruit Sinon, if one thinks about it hard enough. At least there's amusement in the form of Klein in that arc.\\n\r\nThird part? A feels trip we did not fucking need, and wasn't necessary...however, yes it was filler, but we loved it, anyway. I felt that this anime redeemed Asuna in a way where she's no longer unsure of herself, and they really showcased how good she still is as a player. Her rival and perhaps best friend in Yuuki was also a main focus in that arc. This arc also really focuses on the bonds between the two, to the point where many people to this day, even myself, tease yuri shipping between them. It's also refreshing to see Kirito, usually the main character, to not be so involved in this one. What I didn't like about this arc is out of a personal feeling. Yuuki was a character set up to die and give us such unneeded feels to conclude the season, and we sure as hell wished she didn't need to be given that fate.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nMostly returning characters, which are mostly generic, so the grade for characters remains quite low...however, my focus was on the featured characters\\n\r\nI pretty much mentioned most of that in the previous paragraphs. I'll just say this, Sinon's character has some realism to it, and it's actually quite relatable to those in real life who've suffered a similar sort of PTSD. Those kind of people usually try to act strong to hide their pain and fear. This was a main reason why Sinon was one of my favorite SAO characters.\\n\r\nKonno Yuuki, in the last arc of SAO 2, was a person who simply lived life to the fullest, despite her ultimate fate. Her character is so compelling and not something you can easily hate (unless if you're that annoyed with her voice). Her positivity and upbeat personality is really something out of this world, considering how she was technically dying with each day. She is also hella strong in the game, arguably stronger than Kirito (even the latter himself mentioned so).\\n\\n\r\nSOUND/ART:\\n\r\nIt's pretty much around the same grade I gave with the previous season. The staff really knows how to make great soundtracks as well as fit them in the perfect scenarios and situations. The artwork is amazing without being too glamorous, especially with the eyes and the facial expressions.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy this season overall as much as I did with the first season, honestly. Personally, I think it was because without the plot of a death game with high-as-hell stakes, the series felt like a cookie-cut plot with a few or more interesting characters. However, the action and voice acting, as well as the music, is still exhilarating. My grade for that department remains high due to that.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nJUST WATCH BEFORE JUDGING....seriously\\n\r\nNow this review may be kinda messy, but hopefully I brought across my thoughts about this season. If you're a SAO fan, this is a must-watch, imo.\\n\r\nGive this a good number of episodes before deciding on a grade for it.\\n\r\nI do feel that Sinon and Yuuki would mostly come across as very likable, so if they give good impressions for you, you should be able to enjoy this series, no problem at all.\\n\\n\r\nand with that, my review is done",

It has the main character Kirito and he is put to a mission to go into a new virtual world called GGO Gun Gale Online and he meets this girl named Sinon who he can rely on to help him. Sinon has many problems going on in the real world. Kirito brought her some joy and excitement. The reason why Kirito was sent into GGO was to stop this guy who calls himself Death Gun which he later figures out that he was a member of the laughing coffin. Death Gun is somehow killing people not only in the virtual game, but in the real one too and Death gun wants to kill all of the strongest players inn the game including Sinon, so of course Sinon is scared for her life and so Kirito steps in and makes a plan so she doesn't die. And Kirito and Sinon end up getting rid of death gun and his group. I highly think that you should watch even if you were not a fan of sword art online.",

            "content": "As much as I hate to say it, this is probably the best part of Sword Art Online that we've gotten so far, and it has absolutely nothing to do with any of the formerly introduced characters of the show. Even then, the only good part of this season of SAO was the beginning part of GGO. It had an interesting mystery to solve compared to the original season and added an extra layer to the in game death which honestly felt scarier then the original concept as it was always unknown who would die next. The only other good thing about this is Sinon,at least pre second half, as she is the only, and I mean the only character that is actually developed throughout the entirety of this show, but of course by the end she just becomes integrated into the harem of an over powered self insert OC named Kirito that can do literally anything but lose. As for the later part of the season, pretty awful, especially the Caliber arc. Mother's Rosario is alright, but ultimately returns to the original poorly executed ideas.",

            "content": "Wow, SAO2. A sequel to SAO, an awful anime. But, I already wrote a whole review concerning SAO. I'll be covering the Gun Gale Online Arc. Kirito is back, but this time he is embarking on mission in Gun Gale Online. The Government fears that a player who goes by the name, \"Death Gun\" is killing players of GGO in real life. So they send a 16 year old boy to find it if Death Gun is killing people or not. There's also a new female character Sinon. Sinon is a okay character, but eventually she falls into the same fan-service acts that most girlsin this show find themselves in. She could have been a much more fleshed out character. Kirito hasn't changed very much, but they do kind of try to give him some character, that I was really happy about. If they had kept going with it than Kirito might have been a much interesting main character. But sadly we are still stuck with the same edgy teen as last time. Speaking of edgy, the main villain of this arc is Death Gun. Yes, that's his actual name, I wish I could make this stuff up. Death Gun was almost used pretty well in a few scenes, but instead he turns out to be just as bad as the last villain of SAO. He makes no sense and is such a convoluted character that he could ruin this whole arc by himself if it wasn't for all the other issues this arc has. Oh yeah also most of the side characters from SAO are back. They do nothing. The same issues of not doing any research into MMO's, RPG's or FPS's are still around. Pointless scenes to make Kirito look so awesome and edgy. The opening's visuals are pretty bland as well. The fight direction of both SAO and SAO2 are very bad, which causes fights to become very boring. In the climax of this arc it just feels like the writers just made all of it up on the spot. I have not watched anything of SAO2 so I have no idea if the show gets better in the end or not. I'd say that the GGO arc was much better than the ALO Arc in SAO. SAO2 is a bad sequel to a bad anime. It had so many missed opportunities that could have made this a great sequel and a great anime.",

            "content": "Sword Art Online II picks up after the events of Sword Art Online. Much like the first one, the series is split into 2 12 episode arcs. The first arc 'Phantom Bullet' is outstanding. Its offer great action, an amazing new character, and just all around great enjoyment. The second arc however, 'Mothers Rosario' manages to lose all of these qualities. It lacks the action of Phantom Bullet, introduces a character who's mediocre at best, and seemed to nowhere fast. However, it manages to be a somewhat enjoyable watch, at least the first 12 episodes anyway.\r\nStory:\r\nAlthough the story has Kirito diving back into VR MMO's,the story of Phantom Bullet offers a mystery aspect as well as the new character, Sinon, trying to overcome her fears and work with Kirito. Not necessarily the best plot, but it puts the characters in positions where they are forced to trust each other, and that always turns out for the better. Mothers Rosario on the other hand, focus on Asuna for a better portion of it. And while this isn;t necessarily a bad thing, the events which she gets caught up dont even feel like SAO.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThis basically falls within the bounds of the first SAO. Nothing about the art really seemed to stand out too much, but its not boring and droll either. The visuals for the opening of the first half always come to mind when talking about this anime.  As always, solid character designs really helps set the mood for the VR MMO's, and even the character outside of their avatars. The art style and animation and great and smooth and usual though.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nStrong voice acting, good effects, and a decent OST again put SAO on par with the original. This isnt a bad thing, but nothing really seemed to stand out of the crowd. I suppose theres not much to be said in this aspect, I suppose thats more good than bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWhilst Kirito, Asuna, and the rest of the classic SAO gang bring their charms to SAO II, its the introduction of the new character featured in Phantom Bullet that makes this step up. Sinon manages to bring a very relatable, yet lovable character out of the crowd. Yuuki, whom we meet in Mothers Rosario, is a character in which they make us feel sorry for, but we barely get to know before this happens. So while there a bit of back and forth here, Sinon easily makes this category stand out.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nOnce again, this manages to have to have the same feel as the classic SAO, but the Mothers Rosario arc seriously made a dent in the overall enjoyment this has to feature. I forced myself to finish it in the hopes something interesting would happen, and it didn't... However, I feel that Phantom Bullet significantly overshadows even the first SAO, and it what truly makes SAO II what it is.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nClocking in a point below the original, SAO II gets a 6/10. I almost can't stress enough how the second arc brought this down. Unfortunately, I have to weigh it in with Phantom Bullet, where the anime should have just stopped after. If youre a fan of the original SAO, check this one out, and enjoy the ride Phantom Bullet has to offer, however, take my warning of the second arc into consideration.\\n\\n\r\n*Favorite Character\\n\r\nThis without a doubt goes to Sinon. Its a little harder for me to sympathize with a character, but Sinon manages to hit the sweet spot. Someone who's fears feel realistic, anyone whos had to deal with an actual phobia can tell where Sinon is coming from when she faces her fears. Sinon also manages to bring a handfull and basassery with her sniper rife, the Hecate II. Being originally abrasives towards Kirito adds an adorable side to her that is always welcome in a charater. Sinon not only manges to be the strongest character in SAO II, but easily one of my favorite anime characters. \\n\\n",

I don't want to give away too many spoilers if you haven't watched it but if you have seen it you should right away only reason I waited is so i could watch it all at once because I knew I wouldn't be able to stop watching! I cant believe the huge turn in this part of the seriesand it is an amazing addition so happy to have watched this. The emotions in this series was crazy I could not have asked for much more. As always the graphics and visuals in this series were incredible the beautiful landscapes. The cool character designs and move designs is one of the reason Sword Art Online will always be one of my favorite anime series. The best part about this is it added new characters into the ever growing family they have created. I hope to see more from this series there is so much more they can build on and left off with i'd also like to see maybe a series with them as adults to see where the story leads them to see where Kirito and Asuna end up in the future.",

            "content": "Wow, would you look at all the pretentious reviews on this one!\r\nSure SAO 2 is over hyped but justifiably so.\r\nWhen SAO 1 first came out, it championed a whole new genre (of Virtual Reality gaming) not touched upon before at a deep enough level. It was like seeing something akin to Star Wars for the first time - being gripped by the sheer thrill and awesomeness of experiencing something not experienced before. So I guess its only natural for people to hold such high expectations for the sequel, only to be disappointment for, well? Expecting too much.\r\nThough SAO 2 didn't bring anything extra to thetable compared to SAO 1, it nonetheless provided a satisfying and enjoyable experience into the VR fantasy world once again.\\n\\n\r\nStory: A lot of people seem to be throwing tantrums with the storyline because they felt the GGO arc was \"rushed\". Though I agree with the sentiment, and for a moment I almost felt the writers had dug themselves into a corner. Not to give the plot away but I was pleasantly surprised at how the second half of the season did a complete 360 and actually finished on a high note. Besides all the action and \"plot\", SAO 2 showed a more emotional side to it that I was not expecting. And in my opinion, it was pulled off extremely well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The visuals were nothing less than fantastic, as expected for an anime that champions the VR genre. Though I guess SAO 2 did have a ridiculously high budget so they could easily afford to pull it off.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I thought the soundtrack sounded familiarly \"epic\", until I realised it was composed by none other Yuki Kajiura herself (Fate/Zero, Gundam, Madoka Magicka). Enough said.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Most characters are well written though I felt a couple were just being used as leftovers. Take Sinon for example. After the GGO plot, she just felt completely left out for the most part of the second season. Same could be said for Kirito for the second half, and it almost felt like they were trying to force him to be relevant. These are probably a few reasons people seem to dislike SAO 2, but honestly, I didn't let it affect my overall experience that much and just went with the flow.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Regardless of all its faults, hype, and frustration, SAO 2 for me was fun, enjoyable, and well worth the unexpected ride on the feels train towards the end. If you're up for escaping into a rich and vibrant fantasy world that SAO brings to the table then you should definitely watch it. \\n\\n\r\n9/10 would watch again.",

            "content": "After one of the most badly written anime i have seen in a while, it is time to talk about the sequel, SAO II and i have to say that it has some improvements over the shallow, badly written and wasted potential of season 1,it is still broken and it suffers from the same thinks as before but we will get to that.\r\nStory:\r\nGGO arc:\r\nThis time the story takes place in a new game called GGO or Gun Gale Online, Kirito is sent there by the japanese goverment to investigate the deaths of certain players caused by someone named Death Gun. Kiritos mission is to findout if he is the murderer and find out how he does it and report back to the goverment contact that he meets. In the game he meets a new player named Sinon, a sniper that will help Kirito in the GGO.\\n\\n\r\nThis time, Reki Kawahara actually manages to stay on course with this arc but i cant say that it is well written one. Many things are broken in many ways. It does not take a brain to understand that Kirito and Death Gun will duel so what is the point to \"investigate the plotline\". Its not like the japanese goverment will take over, if they could not solve the hostage crisis from season 1, what are the odds that they will do fine here. It is also funny that a kid can do an job of detective investigation better than a professional trained agent, well, i am thinking again, better stop with that.\\n\\n\r\nMothers Rosario Arc:\\n\\n\r\nThe only redeeming quality of this show is a arc where Asuna takes over as a main and thank god for that. No jesus kun and his op bullshit, we actually get an arc with human beings on the screen for once but as much as i like it i still think it is a bit rushed. Asuna meets the new character Yuuki but the show rushes their relationship. In one episode, Asuna meets her and bam in the next one, they are best of friends, If the Excalibur arc (mini arc ep, 15, 16,17) was taken out and Mothers Rosario was placed in there, i belive we would have an amazing arc but right now it is not enough. Overall a good time with Asuna\\n\\n\r\nnow lets talk about the characters.\\n\\n\r\nKirito:\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with this show is him, he enters GGO and immediately starts owning all the elite players in a game that he never played before. He never looses and is never in danger to loose, and that makes this show and its action scenes pointless. Jesus kun has returned folks.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also deals with an mini subplot of him having regrets about his past in SAO and his connections with a guild named Laughing Coffin that killed other players in that game. This is so funny, why dont i remember any of this in the past, oh yes, like before, when the plot requires Kirito to remember or care, he does. Almost an entire episode is dedicated to this crap and now he wimpers and moans about something he did long time ago. Incosistent, OP, self insert, super detective skills pulled out of his ass and so on, yeah, you know the drill by now, my dislike for him continues and is now sky high.\\n\\n\r\nSinon:\\n\\n\r\nSinon is the new girl and the only human being that gets treated as such, i really enjoyed her emotional development when it comes to guns. If she was the main, i would enjoy it much more, true human that actually fears and is afraid and scared, like i said, true human. She is one of the new additions to Kiritos harem collection but she does not join immediatley but she will and in the next arc, she is there with everyone else in the everending collection of girls. Asuna and the others must be happy to get some competition.  \\n\\n\r\nAsuna:\\n\\n\r\nShe is sidelined for the most of GGO arc and the only place she shines is Mothers Rosario arc, She gets some time with her mother and we learn something about this girl ,finally. Should have been the main.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone else:\\n\\n\r\nPointless like allways.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound:\\n\\n\r\nI have to say, the animation this time around is nothing to brag about, sure it still looks good but nothing that made the previous season so good, we even have a scene where Kirito is fighting but everyone else is standing still. The music is not that good either, Yuki Kajiura sounds nothing special here to be honest, all of her music has been a bit dull on the late, dont know, perhaps we need more experiments that she is known for.\\n\\n\r\nThoughts and irritations:\\n\\n\r\nI have allways said that Reki Kawahara cant write good characters, and this show proves it, Kirito is \"plot armor\" protected, does only care when the plot requires him to, wins by deus ex machina ass pulls and more. You are not an badass just becouse you are written to be one. A true badass challenges the opponents that is equal or stronger than you and when the viewer sees this struggle only then can we see the progression within a character and then you are a badass.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, this is a game called GGO, why is Kirito using swords or light sabers and also, there is a scene where a sniper shoots at him on open field and misses and Kirito does not move one inch. This is retarded, man i am a badass, every kid now wants to be like Kirito. There is hovewer one scene where kirito and Sinon sits in a cave and then for some reason, Kirito figures out the entire plot by himself when he sees a lizard with two tails, holy cow, cant talk about it since this is a review  but you will see what i mean.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, another big plothole is Yui, the child AI from the previous season, she is also able to figure out entire plot by herself when Asuna confronts the agent Kirito is in contact with, fucking how, how does she know all this and why did she not tell Asuna about this?, Only Reki knows. There are so much more plotholes but to be honest you get the point by now.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nWhile SAO II is more cleaner than season 1 when it comes to theme and pacing, it still suffers from all the bullshit that we had to endure during season 1. One positive thing is that we dont get any timeskips and thanks for that. What we get is a fanfiction setting where Jesus kun is the master and no one matters, not even Sinon becouse in the end, she is there for the ride and Kirito is the one that takes care of the problem. All other characters do not matter at all. Asuna gets her turn in Rosario arc but even that feels rushed. The game is not even that well explained either, some guns are better than others, agility nerfing, laser swords that can take and reflect bullets etc. Also, there is a lot of sitting with boring exposition and recaps that characters repat of stuff we allready know about.\\n\\n\r\nReki Kawahara simply cant write good lore, characters, settings, expositions,sidelines everyone else that is not Asuna and Kirito. While Sinon is a good character, he should have put Asuna there since they are a couple, that way, he could have made Kirito and Asuna more unique if they struggled together and that way, get them closer. Right now it feels like their romance never happened and that they are at the beginning. The plot with the Laughing Coffin idea is stupid since the first season did a very poor job of talking about them and therefore the audience will not even remember who they were and i certanly did not.\\n\\n\r\nSAO II is simply fanfiction self insert anime that i cant stand. Reki Kawahara, for the next work, write a fucking script and not \"what i feel at the moment\".\\n\\n",

She is soon dragged in his chase after Death Gun, and together they enter the Bullet of Bullets, a tournament where their target is sure to appear. Uncertain of Death Gun's real powers, Kirito and Sinon race to stop him before he has the chance to claim another life. Not everything goes smoothly, however, as scars from the past impede their progress. In a high-stakes game where the next victim could easily be one of them, Kirito puts his life on the line in thevirtual world once more.\"\\n\\n\r\nNow, this part ends in episode 14/15 itself. This is why I hate of SAO, they try to drag the story unnecessarily. The 1st season was the same as well, going good till ep 13-14, and then they start a filler of a story. \\n\r\nI could have easily given it 10 had it ended in 14 episodes or so, but watching those extra episodes for completeness makes me go mad. \\n\\n\r\nEDIT - I wrote the above review when I had watched till 18 episodes. Now after completing the series, I would say that the last 4-5 episodes were good enough. They had nothing to do with the main story and the plot but nevertheless, they were touching. I am raising my rating to 8. \\n\\n",

Additionally, the new VRMO that the first half of the season takes place in is sick! The plot they develop here solving this murder mystery is incredible. SAO continues to inspire and endure. It's worth noting though that the second half functions like a second season and it isn't quite as compelling as it could be. It seems like they sort of ran out of ideas and threw in some newcharacters to reel in feels with. However, this would have been way more compelling if they threw this situation at existing characters instead. Even though the second half underperformed, the series was still incredible overall. All in all, SAO continues to be a blessing to anime. Watch it.",

GGO is complete bullshit game with shitty mechanic that as an ex-professional fps player is really annoyed me. Its okay to say that Shooter game can have a MMORPG aura that you can fight an monster to get a drop, yea its cool. But what annoys me the most is maybe stats effectiveness. Like strengths is stronger than any other statsand Agility is worthless to upgrade, its like an unbalanced FUCKIN GAME! i'm pretty sure that the writer never play a competitive shooter game. \\n\r\nSecondly, the in-game role bullshit :\\n\r\nThe other thing that annoyed me too is the fact that Sinon is the ONLY SNIPER IN THE GAME(according to the story that is). If you play fps games like Battlefield or CSGO, sniper role is very popular and very strong. The reasoning that in GGO sniper doesn't seen very commonly is because the sniper role is very hard to master. Do the writer even know that EVERY PRO GAMER that really wanted to become the best player ALWAYS USE STRONGER METHODS OR ROLE, they don't even care about how hard to master a single role that stronger than any other roles. AND THEY CALLED THAT GGO IS THE ONLY GAME THAT PROS PLAY? ITS BETTER BE CALLED THAT GGO IS ONLY GAME THAT CRYBABIES SELF-CLAIMED \"PRO-GAMER\" PLAY.\\n\r\nThird, back to Alfheim. but who really cares about the 2nd and the 3rd Arc of this 2nd season of SAO, all of them probably rewatch the GGO to enjoy the shit logic of shooter game or open their eyes and moving to an better anime with same style of the game but with great character design and story",

There are chicken nuggets that can develop characters better, and ignorant time skips ruin what could have been amazing. As someone who's developed story boards and thought about the hate on this series extensively I can, without a second thought, say that if I taught a college class about writing a general story board I would use this series as an example of wasted potential. If they took out the time skips and madethe characters more interesting I could actually see myself giving this a 10/10. Between the first season, where they should have made less time skips and the second season, where they made yet another unnecessary virtual world, this series is the embodiment of wasted potential and for lack of a better word, the fuck up of the century. Like where the hell the Sword Art go?",

            "content": "I enjoyed the first season of Sword Art Online a lot, but... this one just didn't go as well.\r\n=== ART and SOUND ===\r\nAs with the first season, the art and soundtrack were both well done. I like cool sci-fi scenes, and many individual frames in the season could be set as my desktop background or something. OPs ane EDs were good as well.\r\n=== STORY ===\r\nOK, here's were it flops. While most people bash on the first story arc's premise, I don't really think the Kiroto's decision to go in and investigate the world was completely unbelievable. I mean, he was one of the top rankedplayers in SAO, so it's reasonable that he'd be one to investigate it.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I don't buy that anyone else would want to go back into a virtual reality game. There was zero explanation as to why they were still playing online games when one had ALMOST KILLED THEM A YEAR AGO. Sheesh.\\n\\n\r\nThe first story arc (at least the part from Kirito's perspective) was alright. It was about the same quality as the second arc from the first season. A bit slow, but still enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe second story arc was not worth mentioning. Those episodes could (and should) completely be cut.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't understand the third arc. No spoilers here, but suffice it to say, it didn't really match the tone of the rest of the show. Besides, it didn't really develop any of the characters, so it frankly could have been cut.\\n\\n\r\n=== ENJOYMENT ===\\n\r\nFirst half of the season was OK, second half was pretty bad. It got dragged out way more than it needed to be, and I was somewhat.\\n\\n\r\nI'm hoping they pull it together for a good third season, 'cause I still like the show, but this season didn't really meet my expectations.",

            "content": "You know its kind of petty coming to MAL and hating on SAO-related content at this point. Everything that could be said about the series has already been said many times by many people, that despite whatever I put there is likely to not be too much originality to it. Almost everybody I know who watches it thinks that it is trash, although I am aware that committed super fans do exist, and its fascinating that people like me continue to watch through not just the first season, but also into the second season despite knowing all to well that any enjoyment that I getwill only be laughing at how poor the quality in the story and characters, falling into both the same old problems and a whole range of new problems and terrible moments that keep it entertaining enough to watch the whole way through. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, here I am anyway, so while I am here I\u2019m going to start with what I liked about the series. Sword Art Online II makes a few decisions that pull it slightly above what can only be described as a disastrous first series; the main decisions I can think of for this are the following\\n\\n\r\n1. Actually having a villain that manages to be intimidating for any of the plot \u2013 in the first two arcs portrayed in the original SAO, the villains were pretty crappy. I don\u2019t remember the designs being pretty intimidating, with the first just being a dude who despite his sadistic intentions of trapping 1000 people in a game leading to the deaths of around 4000 people seems to be viewed of as something of a martyr by the end of it for literally no reason, and then the second villain certainly being vile but not exactly intimidating. Death Gun (I still can\u2019t believe that\u2019s the name they went with) manages to actually be a convincing and intimidating villain. Well\u2026 that is until their character motivations and methods are revealed, as these end up being a little bit disappointing. Still I\u2019ll give points for effort.\\n\\n\r\n2. Speaking of effort, at least the show TRIES to give the characters actual arcs. While their character arc for Kirito in GGO starts off promising it ultimately doesn\u2019t deliver, however I would be lying if I said that Sinon\u2019s arc doesn\u2019t at least finish fairly satisfying. I guess it\u2019s better than nothing\u2026 which instantly makes it better than SAO 1.\\n\\n\r\n3. Also, my problem for most of the arcs tends to be that they don\u2019t take advantage of the universe-inside-a-game settings enough, not telling enough unique stories that can be made within this setting; however, the Yuuki arc seems to be the exception of this, and I\u2019d be lying if I said that there was no effort to evoke an emotional response here (you say feels bait, I say at least they are trying to do something dammit!)\\n\\n\r\nHowever, beyond these aspects I don\u2019t really have anything much positive to say about the show. Its dragged down by many of the things that made SAO bad in the first place; Kirito is boring and when he isn\u2019t overpowered he pulls stupid shit out of his ass, Asuna is underused, fan service is annoying, side characters are pointless, story makes no sense, too much boring exposition, lack of character development for most of the characters, lack of understanding for game mechanics and MMORPG\u2019s, lots of other stupid shit, Yui, Yui, more Yui, etc. There also manages to be new stuff that drags this season down; do I even need to talk about the arc in the middle that goes completely NOWWHERE and is completely pointless and boring, making it essentially a massive waste of time for everyone? I\u2019d say this would drag the season back down lower if it wasn\u2019t so thankfully short.\\n\\n\r\nSo well done Sword Art Online II, you managed to raise the bar from a terrible show to merely a poor one, although its unfortunate to see that as usual with SAO there was potential here in some of the ideas for what could have been a decent season, if not even a good one. \\n",

            "content": "Now since I've reviewed the first SAO, now it's time for SAO 2. Let's get into it.\r\nSo as for the plot, there are two main arcs like in the first one (there's also a really short arc in between the two main arcs). So the plot of the first arc is that there is supposedly this player in another VRMMORPG (GunGale Online)named Death Gun that somehow, is able to kill players in real life as well as the game. And of course, who's the better choice than Kirito to stop this assassin. That's the first main arc. The arc in between just mainly has allthe characters going on this side quest. The last arc involves Asuna meeting this really good Alflein Online player named Yuki (honestly this anime is the worst when it comes to original names Yui, Yuuki, Asuna Yuuki). So Yuuki requests Asuna to join her guild and they become friends. That's all I'm gonna say cause I think saying anymore would be spoilers. So now for my opinion. The plot for the first arc was kind of, ok. It's probably my least favorite arc of the whole SAO franchise, cause I just didn't have a good impression on it. The side quest arc was short-lived, but it had good action scenes. The last arc was probably the best arc of SAO 2 and by far the saddest. It's good cause boring o' Kirito hear is not our main focus and has Asuna as our main character for this arc, and obviously, she's a lot better of a character.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters. Now obviously we have the same characters from the first SAO anime. There is a new character introduced in each main arc. In the Gun Gale arc, we are introduced to Sinon. I just honestly had a very bad impression of her cause I thought she was just another girl to be added to Kirito's harem. She is probably one of the better girls in Kirito's harem cause she did have a backstory and she was one of the main characters in the Gun Gale Arc. But after the Gun Gale arc, she doesn't really seem to have a purpose as if she was completely forgotten. Anyway the other character in the last arc is Yuuki. She is supposedly really good in Alflein and even kicked Kirito's ass if I remembered correctly. She's one of those characters who you would feel very sorry for, cause even though she's very enthusiastic and outgoing, she's hiding something dark (can't tell ya, cause it be a spoiler). So generally, the characters were alright.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the rest of the qualities. I guess the openings and endings were good, but not as good as the first SAO. Voice actors did their job. I guess the enjoyment would be pretty good in the Gun Gale, and the emotional feelings would be strong in the last arc.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum it up, SAO 2 is nothing too outstanding. It's a little bit less enjoyable than the first one, but I think it's still worth watching. There's nothing that stands out too much in the 2nd SAO, but I think it'll still give you some of that feeling of adventure. Not as much as the first SAO, but it's still there.",

            "content": "The second season of the Sword Art Online series.\r\nI can see why most people who enjoyed the first SAO absolutely hate the second one.  A lot of people enjoyed the fact that Sword Art Online, was Sword Art Online.  But in the second season, there is very little, close to none, Sword Art Online.  'But, there's ALfhiem Online in it!'  In my opinion, I ABSOLUTELY HATED ALFHEIM ONLINE!  It had no meaning.  Before I turn this into a rant, here is the review:\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nAs I was saying, barely any SAO. I fairly enjoyed Gun Gale Online, for some reasonit made me happy..?  Gun Gale Online was fairly pretty good, but the fact that it took over half the season to finish the point, nope.  ALfheim Online was a whole different story.  It may seem that I hate people with diseases or something, but no, it was just not interesting. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nThe art in Sword Art Online is always great, that's all I can say.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nCompared to most anime I've watched, Sword Art Online has the best 'sound.'  It always puts the best scene to the song, the best sound effects to the best scenes, ect.  All I can say is that it sounded 'right'??\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the backstory of each character has different effects on the anime.  Kirito and Suguha's backstory could add a lot of conflict if Suguha didn't take the 'truth' so lightly.  Asuna's backstory is probably one of the least expected out of them all, in my opinion.  And for one relating to Sword Art Online II, Sinon's backstory reminds me of something. Hmm... Yuki and Yuno??\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nI would've rated this higher if I actually liked the anime..\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nThis anime was not good, but not bad, kind of original, kind of not.  I don't think I would've rated this anime so high if I would watch more anime, but I really don't know if I would come back later and change this. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall score I average from the score of everything else.",

The only good thing about the series was Sinon, the next one to be part of Kiritos crazy harem party. \r\nNow for the on slaught of bad things. This series is just plain awful. The story is awful. The characters are awful. The soundtrack is bad. The series was not enjoyable atall. Pretty much nothing in this series is any good. \\n\r\nDo not ever watch Sword art online 2. Never watch it. Never have I watched anything so bad in my life. If you were to ever watch this series I feel very sorry for you. Listen to my advice. You will need to. Just avoid this series. This is where somebody should just stop what they are doing and look at them selves in the mirror and say \"how did I get to this point in my life\" and regret what they had brought to our screens. Watching this series is pretty much worse than torture. This is the most polite review I can possibly make for this series. I would talk about it in a way which shows all the hatred but that would probably take me about 7 hours to make. This is just a brief review.",

            "content": "Warning: This review contains MILD spoilers. \r\nSAO is one of the most highly contested anime ever made. All over the 'net, the passion is insane - either for or against it. Personally, though I acknowledge it's many faults, I truly enjoy the series as a whole and greatly looked forward to the second season.\r\nStory (by arc)\r\nGGO: This arc did do some good things - however, I will admit, it isn't a favorite arc in general for me. I liked that events from SAO trickled into this new game and that consequences from the characters previous actions came back to bite them in this arc. Sinonwas a character I liked ... and hated too. Her issues were serious, but for some reason, I felt little emotion for her - there was a coldness I couldn't get past with her and her story, though I liked her character and the strong female lead she portrayed. It was nice to see Kirito get some development and to see the internal issues that haunt him from the previous game. Overall the GGO story was \"meh\" for me - enjoyable when it came to the left-over issues from the original series, but the fights and the game itself just didn't interest me and the overall story and characters introduced just brought little to the table for me.\\n\\n\r\nCaliber: This was a cute, mission arc I did enjoy. The mythology woven into the mission was enjoyable though I felt the arcs purpose was to bring Sinon into the fold and begin focusing on the \"group\" once more. Could SAO 2 done without it? Yes. Definitely. But it wasn't a horrible - for me, it felt like an OVA that should have been released after the seasons end and wasn't important enough to include within the season itself.\\n\\n\r\nMothers Rosario: This is one of my favorite arcs in the entire SAO series and one of the better written works by the author. This arc was more mature. It finally gave Asuna a chance to shine and develop while introducing us to the wonderful character that is Yuuki. Yuuki shone bright in this arc - bringing entertainment and joy before delivering some incredibly emotional reality to the screen. This arc did several things - 1) It dethroned it's previously considered OP hero, Kirito, and showed us the true strongest swordsman in the game. This was important for me - Kirito had always been so strong and perfect, seeing up one-upped was refreshing. You can't always be the strongest. I love him, but I felt this action was important nonetheless as his character has been previously far too overpowered. 2) Yuuki and her personal struggles brought a lot of reality to the screen - her personal struggles brought a very mature issue to the screen and how she handled her struggle was refreshing to witness. \\n\\n\r\nThe idea of using the technology we saw destroy people in season one, bring people who are sick or facing challenges peace, escape and joy was wonderful. And incredibly emotional. When one sits down, how many of us have someone we know affected by the same challenges many of the characters in this arc faced? And how wonderful such technology would be for those people? This arc had weight and felt more \"real\" much like the first half of the first season. Whether the explanation of Yuuki's illness itself is correct, I'm unsure, but the message the arc delivered resonated nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6. As I went over above - I enjoyed the entire season however I felt GGO - as a whole was a meh arc and Caliber would have been better as an OVA so because of that, my overall ranking of the story is weighted down. Mother's Rosario, the final arc, was excellent and the shining star of the season - on it's own, I give it a 8. This season had issues with pacing and flow in terms of the overall story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8. As usual, the art was beautiful. The series has always been beautifully animated with very appealing art. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8. The OST is excellent for the SAO series and the quality of all of the opening and ending themes was excellent. The voice acting was well done with specific characters really shining as their VAs were spot on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6. A solid sequel with strong and weak areas, an incredible closing arc, beautiful art and solid sound. It was different than the first series in that it had three separate arcs and the flow wasn't as smooth because of it but it returned to similar season one magic with it's third and final arc. The final episode set us up for a great third season, should we get one, and a satisfying (IMO) close should we not.",

The action and the story were mediocre. \r\nOne thing that upset me was cross-dressing Kirito, who looked really retarded and I don't get the reason as for why the author decided to make him look like this. \r\nAdditionally the whole idea of Kirito usinga f*kin lightsaber in a shooter MMO was absurd, especially with the whole Star Wars lightsaber sound rip-offs. \\n\\n\r\nSo I give this part II an overall 4, judging it just as some producers trying to get more money out of this franchise and annoying us with all those Kirito + Asuns/Sinon cosplays.",

            "content": "I put off watching Sword Art Online II for so long, and to be honest, I wish I hadn't. I only started watching it because my friend Raydon convinced me to.\r\nSo the story seems fairly simple at first. A new virtual game for an adaptation of the Nerve Gear. Some random guy is on a stream bragging about winning some contest. Then, a strange cloaked figure walks into the pub. He proclaims that he and his gun share the same name: Death Gun. He shoots at the guy on the stream. Suddenly, the guy on screen clutches at his heart and disconnects from the server.\r\nOutof every villain I have ever seen in an anime, none of them have genuinely intimidated me like Death Gun did. Every time he was on screen, I had my hands covering my mouth wondering what he would do. Accompanied by his ominous theme, he dominates the screen. Get into the anime more and you find out his background. It's truly a frightening experience.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, as was the same in the second half of Sword Art Online, I wasn't a huge fan of returning to Alfheim. While the reward was interesting, the plot idea seemed rushed and just a filler so that they could get to New Aincrad. The ending is very sad and if you watch the anime you will see why.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Sword Art Online II is worth watching and I did enjoy it. I personally would rewatch it up until the second half, but otherwise very well done. Hoping for Season 3 :)",

            "content": "*There will be spoilers in this review*I have to start this off by being frank: I dropped this series after the GGO arc finished airing back in 2014. Recently, I became aware that the last half of the season was actually somewhat good, so I put my reservations aside and watched the rest of the series. Keep in mind that my memories of the GGO arc are a year and a half old and my views may have been swayed by other reviews of the series. \r\nSo, what do I think of the sequel to the horrid Sword Art Online? It\u2019s shit. \r\nArt & Sound(9/10 & 8/10): Starting off easy. You have to give A-1 pictures credit, they can make good looking animation. The art style is beautiful, as always, and the sound is fairly decent too. There is one battle soundtrack that gets to me though, but it might be because Gigguk ruined it in his original review of SAO. \\n\\n\r\nStory/Writing (3/10): The writing for this series is horrendous. I can't recall much about the GGO writing, but the Calibur arc was complete garbage and there were two (2!) entire episodes (15 & 18) in the last ten that were entirely devoted to exposition dumps through talking. I got to the end of episode 15 and thought to myself, did I just watch 10 straight minutes of some lady talking to the party about this quest? I don\u2019t remember anything she told them beyond, \u201cExcalibur is at the bottom of that upside down pyramid. Now get it before all of my pets are killed or this Troll king will take over the entire game. Lol.\u201d Episode 18 has the same formula: Liz (?) tells Asuna about Yuuki for 12 minutes. Isn't there a  better way to dump all this information on us than just talking at us for 15 minutes straight? Do you not know about show, don't tell?? Can we not see these things happen, instead of being talked at for 10 minutes? Goodness. There are also some weird time skips in the later half that have to do with a vaguely defined New Year's break and it left me confused, especially in episode 18.  \\n\\n\r\nGun Gale Online (3.5/10): I\u2019ll be honest, the reason why I picked up this series back in 2014 was to see if it could possibly be as bad as the first series, and also because I had heard that Kirito turned into a girl. The premise of this monstrosity is simple: In a game called Gun Gale Online, a scary dude called Death Gun starts killing people in the virtual world and they end up dead in the real world. Kirito-kun is recruited by the government to investigate Death Gun in GGO. In the game he meets a girl, there\u2019s a tournament (oh, joy), and in the end, things get rapey. At the start, the story seemed pretty solid, and I\u2019ll admit I was hooked by the mystery of Death Gun. However, the ending had many problems, including the whole Death Gun reveal, and it pissed me off so much that I ended up dropping it. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending was bad. So bad. I don\u2019t understand why SAO continues to put its females in these sorts of situations (Asuna was bad enough), but there has to be another way to put women in danger than to instantly go the rape route. The whole Death Gun mystery ended up being convoluted and disappointing, and I had honestly forgotten that Laughing Coffin existed from the first series, so that threw me for a loop. Add in some PTSD for Kirito from a battle that would have been nice to see in the original series instead of being introduced like the author just willed it into existence for the sake of the plot, and you get a bad arc. Bad writing, bad story, bad characters, bad everything. It\u2019s a horrible waste of time that leads into another horrible waste of time. \\n\\n\r\nCalibur (2.5/10): This three-episode waste of time only exists for Kirito to get his hands on a sword that will make him even more OP than he already is. This sword was apparently introduced in the first season\u2019s battle between Kirito and the crazy butterfly rapist, but I had completely forgotten about it. Kirito, Kirito\u2019s harem, and Klein, bless him, embark on a quest to save some people god knows where in ALO (is it beneath the tree? I don\u2019t know). They get Excalibur and Mjolnir for their troubles (writer-san, I think you\u2019re getting your mythologies crossed!). Anyway, Thor appears and Kirito almost throws his beloved sword away, but Sinon saves it for him. The resulting interaction between the two made it obvious that this situation only happened to fan the Kirito/Sinon pairing and to get the rest of Lord Kirito's harem of forgettable women pissy. \\n\\n\r\nThis arc is a mess. The writing sucks, the characters still suck, this whole thing was useless filler garbage. \\n\\n\r\nMother's Rosario (8.5/10): The beacon of hope in a sea of garbage. This is the arc I was waiting for, an good god is it good. I can't tell if I think so highly of it because it's legitimately good or because it's the best arc SAO has yet to offer. Anyway, this arc centers around Yuuki's guild and their quest to beat a boss by themselves so that they can create an unforgettable memory together. They recruit Asuna to be the seventh party member and go off on their adventure. Other things happen, but this arc is too good to spoil. Watch it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (2/10): Let's do this.\\n\\n\r\nKirito: It's not Kirito's fault that he is written this way. Most LN protagonists are written in such a way that the males reading it can easily insert themselves into the story. Kirito is just the most prominent anime LN male protagonist. The main problems I have with Kirito are that his personality sucks, his motivations for doing anything are thin at best, and he is so OP that in a game about god damn guns he chose a lightsaber and fucking won. In GGO, he suffers from PTSD from an event that was never adequately shown or explained just to, in my opinion, have something in common with Sinon. In Calibur, he throws his new, OP sword away because he can't carry it and doesn't even think to throw it towards his friends because, fuck them, they can't even touch this sword. God, I really dislike Kirito. He will always be a problem with this series. Points to MR for making him a background character. \\n\\n\r\nSinon: When Sinon was introduced, I had high hopes for her as a character. She seemed like a badass, but those hopes were instantly dashed the moment the first panty shot flashed across my screen. Oh no. She\u2019ll become another Asuna, I thought. Hyped up as a badass, but ultimately needing help from Kirito-kun, god of VRMMORPGs. And I was right.  Sigh. It was disappointing to see Sinon go from a badass to just another girl for Kirito\u2019s growing harem of girls I can\u2019t even remember. The one thing the story did do well was her trauma surrounding guns, and the way she tried to overcome it by playing GGO was very well done. Bravo, SAO 2, you get a point.  Too bad she was invisible for the later half of the series. Oh yeah, and sexual assault. Boo, SAO 2, you lose 100 points. \\n\\n\r\nAsuna: Practically invisible for 17 god damn episodes, Asuna, the main female character of the series was pushed aside in favor of Kirito's ever growing harem of forgettable girls. It was only in the MR arc that she got to shine and become the protagonist (progress!) of the arc. Her battle prowess is highlighted in this arc, as well as her insecurities over her worth as a team mate. She also gets a side plot with her mom and really grows as a character under Yuuki's guidance. Her friendship with Yuuki is really good too, and its nice to see her with out Kirito for once. However, this is too little too late in my opinion. Asuna's character has been declining since the middle of the first arc, and I see no reason why the writers won't put her on the back burner again in favor of Kirito-kun. Oh joy.\\n\\n\r\nKlein: Not much for him, but he did try to get two (!) girlfriends. Too bad one of them turned into Thor, but he did get a nice hammer out of it. Also, the party would have been fucked against Troll dude if he had just left that woman in the cage. Good job, dude. \\n\\n\r\nKirito's Harem: Forgettable, badly written, useless. \\n\\n\r\nYui: At least she allows them to cheat by yelling out attack patterns and weaknesses!\\n\\n\r\nBar guy: We learn that he is married. Revolutionary. His bar is ousted as a meeting place in favor of the cabin. \\n\\n\r\nYuuki: A wonderful ray of sunshine and hope in a sea of garbage characters. A better Kirito than Kirito. Uplifts her teammates. Doesn't let her situation in life get her down. A beautiful soul., a beautiful character, I love her. I can't into too much detail about her without spoiling MR, nuut she is my favorite SAO character. Perfection.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (3/10): I have to give props to SAO 2, it certainly was able to capture my attention and an episode seemed to go by very quickly. This says nothing about the quality, but at least I was entertained. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (5/10): I do have to give credit to MR and Yuuki, which is where most of this score is coming from. However, the shitshow that was the first 18 episodes cannot be overlooked. The writing is bad, the characters are bad, the story is passable at best. Asuna is constantly in the background to make room for forgettable harem girls and Sinon. Kirito is Kirito. There appears to be no other males in this gaming world except Klein and the bar guy. The harem is always annoying. \\n\\n\r\nWithout MR this would most likely be a 3/10. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "What to say about SAO 2, hmmm well lets start of by saying that I did not enjoy the first one nor did I hate it just because it was cool. I like to give everything a chance even though I knew that this one was going to be a doozie. Well lets begin. \r\nTL:DR version \r\nIf your either a viewer in the younger demographic or just a casual anime watcher you will probably enjoy this show quite a bit, and that's not a bad thing since well that's who it was designed for. It's aesthetics are quite good as well as its battle scenes,If you like small gun skirmishes you'll like a lot of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of this review contains minor spoilers though nothing that isn't explained in the first 3 episodes   \\n\\n\r\nThe long Version \\n\r\nAlright now that I have got that out of the way its time to start my \"long\" segment (If you can call it that). Too start I want to talk about the one thing that kept me from dropping this anime Sinon. Sinon is a nice change of pace for the SAO series as she feels more thought out then most other characters in the series her backstory is a bit extravagant yet it keeps it believable for a viewer. Her motivation is sound from very early on which is contrary to what we had going on for Kirito in the first season something that made him, at least in my eyes very hard to relate to. Sinon is much like Lizbeth in the first series, a character who you like because she is different then most of the other girls in this series. There strong thought out and have some real emotion in them that doesn't seem planned or fake. It's a shame they both fall into the Kirito rejected women's club. All in all Sinon is what kept my Character rating above the overall.  I could keep talking about Lizbeth and Sinon for paragraphs however I must move on or risk this becoming too long. \\n\\n\r\nThe story...... well It wasn't great. The biggest problem I have with SAO 2's story is that it could have been so much better when I found out that death gun is a former laughing coffin member I thought to my self \"Maybe SAO did it right this time however what they do with this, honestly stroke of inspiration is acceptable at best. i rate the story so poorly mostly because of what it could have been but i chose to throw it all away. and that saddens me. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt, I know many reviewers go into the art of an anime extensively. I however don't choose to. Being an artist myself its hard for me to call art bad just cause I most of the time can relate to the work the artist put into it regardless of how bad the story is. In SAO's case the art is quite good as well as the sound. Nothing seems out of place and the seen seems to be smooth and not choppy. It is pretty average in these departments and well that's all that can be said.\\n\\n\r\nFinally we come to enjoyment, I enjoyed some parts of SAO 2. The fight scenes were good and the first episode of Kirito actually being in GGO I genuinely enjoyed. Most scenes where Kirito and Sinon are in the same place are quite good and seem to flow better the average. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all SAO is just a meh show it does nothing amazing and does some to a bunch of things wrong depending on who you ask. It really fails in a department I really care about which is story, something that lower my rating of this show by a fair amount of points. Its art and sound are nice yet most of it character are not very deeply thought out. However I can see why so many people like this show, Its a pretty average show for an audience that isn't looking for anything astounding so it has it's nietch and well that's all I can really say about SAO 2. See you all at the movie.",

            "content": "Actually, I think it's better than SAO.\r\nNow I though SAO was okay. The first arc was good, second arc wasn't, but was still fun at times. SAO 2, though riddled with flaws, makes up for them with outstanding strengths.\r\nArc 1: Gun Gale Online\r\nSo the story for this one is okay. It gives us a enjoyable \"Who done it\" story that keeps you wondering, without really anything special to stand out regarding the mystery storyline alone. What redeems it is Asada Shino. The writers have broken SAO tradition and made a complex, lovable and realistic character dealing with PTSD, and they embody it realistically and heartbreakingly.One of the best scenes of the series is a scene where we learn Asada's backstory, through a PTSD flashback. It's a heart wrenching and beautiful scene. The chemistry (Not gonna say if romantic or otherwise) between Asada and Kazuha is amazing. They work together, and deeply bond with each other by relating to each other by the tragedies they went through. For a moment, we can actually see a bit of character in Kazuha. Watching them interact is heartwarming.\\n\\n\r\nArc 2: Excalibur\\n\r\nIf you enjoy watching the characters do a mindless quest together you might have fun watching this. The perk is that this arc is only 3 episodes virtually skippable. There might be a couple small things that change, but they're nothing you can't pick up in the next arc. It mostly doesn't effect the story at all. I mean, it was mindless action and banter with no real character or story, but if you're into that give it a go. Otherwise, skip this arc.\\n\\n\r\nArc 3: Sleeping nights\\n\r\n.... (Sob) The show takes a turn from it's usual action and becomes a story about friendship, moving on from the past, dealing with loss, and knowing you are about to lose someone. I'm not gonna say too much cause spoilers, but this arc focuses almost exclusively on Asuna and a character that is introduced just for this arc. This is the arc where Asuna becomes a good character, as we get to see interactions between her and her mother, who fight often about Asuna's future and education. Watching them interact is very good and realistic. It also brings up many more questions of \"Real world, virtual world, whats the difference?\".\\n\\n\r\nThe arc starts a bit slow, but it focuses on some very nice themes, and helps us to grow closer to the characters. When things pick up, I found myself unable to take myself away from it. It's an emotional roller coaster, with a touching beginning, a tragic middle, and a bittersweet end.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, SAO 2 makes many major improvements on the first season, and while there are still many flaws, it redeems them with overwhelming strengths. Season 2 is by far, more moving, emotional, gripping and immersing. And we never lose that sense of fun that comes from watching the series, the good arcs and the bad.\\n",

On top of that, the animation is great as is the writing in general.  \r\nI won't spoil anything, but there's an area where Sword Art Online II really shines.  This showwill make you feel so many emotions.  I've never seen an anime that has made me feel so sad, so happy, so hopeful, all within the span of a few minutes.  I've never dreaded finishing a season so much, knowing how it would probably end, while simultaneously craving it, and needing to see how it ended.  Watching Sword Art Online II, I just relate to all of the characters so much, and feel what they feel.  Everything they go through, and everything they feel, just resonates with me on an emotional level I've never felt before.  In my opinion, this show will just make you feel truly alive.",

            "content": "Let's Start with that This review is from a critical/professional level meaning I look more into the scenes instead of watching them once and forgetting about them. Taking into account everything throughout the whole series into one section of the review each leading to the Overall Score. Meaning most of this will not be my personal opinion.\r\nIf I were to write something personal (it would be written in brackets like this)\r\nNow let's move on to the review!\r\n[Story] 3/10 - The plot of this series really falls behind its original counterpart. It's boring, hard to follow and it barely developed. If you are looking for aplot heavy kind of person this is not the anime for you as it jumps around a lot has pointless scenes that don't do anything other than show anime girls and if it doesn't develop character or move along the plot the scene is pointless. (I will get into more depth of character development later). This season is yet again split into arcs. The GGO ARC and the Mother Rosario ARC. I might as well give them a number out of 10 to make this more structured.\\n\r\n[GGO ARC] 7/10 - This is the arc that really makes this season the best out of the two. Character Development is really the strong suit in this arc. I wont say anything else about it as I don't want to do the job of the synopsis or spoil it for you.\\n\r\n[Mother Rosario ARC] 2/10 - I might have spelled the ARC's name wrong, but that's because it was so forgettable. Boring, rare and horrible action scenes. Music choice was horrible most of the time and the \"touching\" scenes are horribly fleshed out characters. If they really didn't waste time and actually developed characters for once this would be so much better.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation] 9/10 - This is the one thing that is ranked pretty high over all of the other sections. The Design choices were all very nice, the character design was pretty mediocre though. You can really give this a thumbs up for making fleshed out settings and backgrounds, which really develop the world they are in. Rarely making any of the background super generic or boring. The effects of the weapons are also really well done in this series. The art has really been better than the previous season. There is ONE scene which is really well animated and happens to be my favorite scene in the whole series.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound] 6/10 - Sound/Music are crucial to scenes and even make or break a mood. There are many scenes that have music that really break the scenes overall feel. Taking you away from the topic at hand, especially if its a harder more darker topic such as death. Overall it could have been better, sometimes no music at all makes a scene more hard hitting and sometimes it doesn't. (It's a risk I hope the creators take in the future)\\n\\n\r\n[Character] 4/10 - This is were most if not all of the problems are in this series as a whole. Is character development. It may seem like I'm narrowing this out of the whole character section but this needs to be written about. In the last season, there was little to no character development. Especially from the other characters that aren't Asuna or Kirito.  Now this season has two arc and im going to split the character development over the two.\\n\r\n[GGO ARC Development] 8/10 - This is how they should've done character development from the beginning. Sinon is the newest character that was added to the cast of almost people. They way they made it look like she was one of the MAIN characters is really nice. They spend several episodes going over her backstory and developing her character. The way they do it, makes me feel for the character. Makes me think better about the character. Which is how character development should have been done. It's meant for the viewers to understand the character better which in turn makes the character's decisions more meaningful and an impact on them or the story.\\n\r\n[Mother Rosario ARC Development] 2/10 - This is not bad.... it's horrible. This is the lowest point in all of the series. Including Season 1. This ARC's characters are flat nobody's who give a sob story with little to no background on said sob story and hopes that it makes you feel bad for them. That is not how you write a character or develop one. Just Don't Do This Again Creators... ever.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment] 6/10 - This is a more personal section. So I wont be using brackets. Overall my entire enjoyment level came from the GGO Arc. As it was interesting, the battle scenes kept me engaged and the scenes outside of the game weren't boring or sleep inducing. The rest of my enjoyment which is around 1 point out of the 6 im giving this. Is from the Mother Rosario Arc. It was boring, I actually fell asleep during one of the episodes and had to re-watch it with a sleepy expression. I barely remember anything from this Arc. The only things I really truly remember are the horrible plot points in which I will not spoil. And the ending. THE ENDING, is forced and quick. I felt as if it didn't tie loose ends and if it did. I didn't catch them. Now you might be wondering where that 1 point came from if all im saying is negative stuff about it. This Arc suffers from \"so bad its good syndrome\" where some of the scenes are so bad that it's funny. I had a good laugh during most of this Arc. I showed some of the scenes and re-watched a few with a buddy of mine and they were so funny. And the best part is. The scenes weren't supposed to be funny, they were just plain bad.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall Score] 6/10 - Now this is definitely better than season 1 of SAO. In almost every aspect. Do I recommend this? Yes.... the first ARC... then turn it off and watch something good. Re capping this hunk of junk would be a waste of my time. But for structure I must.\\n\r\nThe first half of the series is great! Wonderful action scenes and good character development keeps the horrible plot from dragging it down. The later-half of the series on the other hand. Is so bad, it basically does a completely 180 from the first half. Doing everything the first half does, but worse. \\n\\n\r\nHope this review helps even though im forced to not write anything spoiler related. I would have loved to go deeper into this series but I cannot due to that rule. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading! Have a wonderful rest of your day!",
