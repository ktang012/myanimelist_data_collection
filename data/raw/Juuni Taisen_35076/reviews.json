            "content": "I'm sick and tired of seeing people treat Juuni Taisen like trash because the plot is predictable. \r\nIt might just be intentionally predictable!\r\nI know, how blasphemous! \r\nAs if its intention was to besmirch the name of our beloved Fate and the tarnish the genre it birthed into existence!\r\nDid it really take everyone 12 episodes to realize that the show reveals the order of every characters\u2019 death by the end of the first episode?\r\nWould it be so far-fetched to imagine that Juuni Taisen actually wanted to put an original spin on the battle royale genre? \r\nOr does every battle royale show have to be likeFate to be deemed \u201cgood\u201d? Don't get me wrong, I love Fate/Zero, but just because it's an exemplary entry in the genre doesn't mean every other show in it needs to be exactly like it. \\n\r\nInstead of trying to stand out with spectacular visuals, Juuni Taisen offers compelling characters and lots of new spins on the genre to keep you engaged.\\n\\n\r\nPositives:\\n\r\n+Exhilarating Music\\n\r\n+Interesting Character Backstories\\n\r\n+Tense Action\\n\r\n+Solid CGI\\n\r\n+Innovations to the Genre\\n\r\n+Grimdark Aesthetic\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\n-Lacking World Building\\n\r\n-Dragon and Snake's episodes\\n\r\n-Visual Quality Inconsistencies\\n\\n\r\n[Story: 6.5/10]\\n\r\nIn coming up with the score for the story I included both the actual plot and the way that the story is delivered because it is a crucial part of the experience.\\n\\n\r\nJuuni Taisen understands how predictable stories in the Battle Royale genre can be, and it plays with this idea of predictability. It\u2019s a show that acknowledges the nature of its genre, all of the opponents in a death game but one will die eventually. It rubs its predictability in your face and forces you not try to figure out who will die next, but to analyze the show\u2019s other aspects. Namely, the characters, but we\u2019ll cross that bridge when we get there. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the setting and plot themselves, they are fairly barebones but sturdy enough to hold up the exciting action and character stories. Whenever the show draws attention to the behind the scenes of the zodiac war it feels very apparent that it\u2019s the most undercooked part of the show. Occasionally we see anonymous bidders watching the battle, but there is little reason for these segments other than showing us important people view the game as a form of entertainment. In the backstories side characters offhandedly mentioning how the zodiac war is some myth that is typically referred to as very important, but that doesn\u2019t come across at all during the actual war itself, as it mostly focuses on the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe city that the competitors battle in is entirely devoid of life, with little explanation to the why and how. Characters have special powers connected to their zodiacs, although the powers are cool and well implemented into the action they have no explanation for their existence in the real world. Very little of the actual plot is clear, but each character\u2019s backstory is enough to make up for its issues. The backstories worked so well to get me invested that whenever the characters engaged in combat I was on the edge of my seat hoping for the more developed character to survive despite knowing the inevitable would come. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending will no doubt disappoint some people, but its tameness didn't bother me. For me, it concluded the characters' stories in a satisfying way and it gave me everything I expected from the ending.\\n\\n\r\n[Character: 8/10]\\n\r\nMost of the entertainment from Juuni Taisen comes from the characters, as you\u2019d expect from a battle royale show with a paper-thin plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe cutthroat cast of twelve mercenaries/warriors are each represented by one of the twelve zodiac signs. Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Boar. They all have special abilities related to their sign which are revealed over time, another mystery that adds a layer of tension to the thrilling atmosphere. Even their deaths are directly tied to their zodiac sign. This opens another avenue for analyzing each character, and frankly, it's not surprising to see a writer as impressive as Nisio Isin try to innovate the battle royale genre like this. Also, they\u2019re all edgy as hell. All of them, it's funny how on point they are to the edgy battle royale genre style the show is aiming for and successfully hitting it. Their personalities are all very distinct and are represented by their character designs. Their designs also have elements that represent their zodiac sign. Whether it be Usagi\u2019s bunny ears and high heels or Niwatori\u2019s chicken style outfit and pitchfork for a weapon. They all look absurd and have the strong personalities and backstories to justify their designs.  \\n\\n\r\nTheir personalities are quite overdone, but once you see the explanation for why they behave the way they do you\u2019ll be more inclined to embrace them. Although a couple of the character backstories didn\u2019t quite do it for me (namely Dragon and Snake) because of their stories, while funny and full of action, blatantly disregarded what made the other character so well developed. Even with all the absurdity, a majority of the challengers evoke empathy from their backstories and make you think, oh now I get why that character is trying so hard to look cool. At first, they\u2019re vicious killing machines, then the show makes you pity them and you'll become endeared in their struggle to win, no matter how futile it may be.\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 6.5/10]\\n\r\nThe quality of the art and animation varies, it starts off great but has a noticeable drop-off in quality in the later episodes. While in the actual present-day Zodiac War the visuals are quite good, solid character art, a dark and moody desolate city, and sometimes really great battle animation. During the flashbacks is where the art quality starts to drop. In the early episodes the art and animations look good all around, but as the episodes go by the flashbacks have noticeably less motion and become mostly conversation scenes. Not to say that the conversations aren\u2019t interesting, but the show is at its best during the high stakes action.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s understandable that the budget isn\u2019t huge considering it\u2019s a new story from a fairly small studio. I can commend Graphinica for subtly swapping the art style to CGI to save funds in the later episodes because of how great it looks. Don't expect to see low frames CGI like what we got with Ajin in this show. Graphinica previously worked a fairly good looking CGI movie, Expelled from Paradise, so it\u2019s great to see that they\u2019ve only gotten better through practice. I didn\u2019t struggle to forgive the issues with the visuals while watching the show, but I have to knock it a few points for some distracting quality dips during the middle episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe greatest saving grace of the show's visuals is its grimdark aesthetic. You might just call this \"edge\" and you'd be right, but it's consistent edge that is totally in keeping with the rest of the show. Scenes are full of shadows, dark colors, and the fact that the war takes place during mostly the nighttime with rain and clouds during the day. Every aspect of the show contributes to this style and the visuals pull plenty of the weight. While the art is far from perfect, I can say it makes up for enough of its flaws with a memorable personality.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 8.5/10]\\n\r\nA nice tense soundtrack that gets the blood pumping during action sequences. It ranges from orchestral music to EDM and I liked all of it. It\u2019s also present during the slower scenes where characters are conversing to add a layer of tension, reminding you that they have to kill each other as soon as they finish talking. There are times it strikes the audience with some more sad songs to hammering home the brevity of some of the show's tragic situations. I feel safe saying it's one of the best OSTs of the season, as well as having a great alternative rock OP. The ed has a good song that\u2019s more subdued than the show that precedes it.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is good across all 12 contestants and there's a dub as well that's not as good as the Japanese voice acting but it's nice to have the option.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 9/10]\\n\r\nDespite having exciting action, a majority of the show\u2019s screen time is flashbacks and talking scenes. I liked a lot of the backstories, but as I said earlier not all of them are interesting. Your mileage may vary when it comes to enjoying Juuni Taisen, I really liked it but it may not be for everyone. If you can embrace the edginess regardless of the absurd plot then you\u2019ll probably find it to be an enthralling watch.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Score: 7.7/10]\\n\r\nYou know how Fate Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works has great visuals but it leans on them so hard because it has almost nothing else noteworthy going on? Well, Juuni Taisen doesn\u2019t have the luxury of being able to slack off because its visuals aren\u2019t anything to write home about, that's why it devotes so much time to its characters and offers up some intriguing hooks. In the end, it\u2019s just a good time. If you go into it expecting Fate you\u2019ll be disappointed.",

They kill someone off every episode, and to give the characters a little depth before they die the writers shove 15 minutes of exposition down your throat before killing the character said exposition corresponds to with an obsessive level of violence    effectively wasting your time because you just learned the backstory of cannon fodder.\\n\\n\r\nAre you worried about your favorite character dying? Well don't be I assure you that every backstory is written in a way to guarantee that the viewer will hate the guts of any character that gets one. \\n\\n\r\nAlso it has a decent into madness type vibe so there's also that.",

            "content": "[Spoiler Warning]\r\nDo you know what Juuni Taisen lacked? The music in comedy anime where someone does something stupid. Everything was so stupid here that it might've been better to just make it a comedy anime. And even with that my score would've been maybe 5 instead of 4\r\nAfter watching all of the show, I want to say that this anime... Had potential. And a lot of it. But it went downhill really fast.\r\nI'm going to talk about the pattern of the anime, which makes almost every episode the same, the poor \"border story\" and why the anime which is tagged only as \"Action\"- doesn't doanything interesting with action. Minor spoilers but I do not specify names.\\n\\n\r\nSo, when I first saw Juuni Taisen, I got hyped \"Another Fate? Sounds cool!\" and the story is pretty simple. 12 fighters, 1 wish, fight to death, last one standing (probably).\\n\\n\r\nWhere did it fall off? Basically at the end of the first episode, but you only realize it later.\\n\\n\r\nJuuni Taisen repeats a pretty bad pattern for almost every episode.\\n\\n\r\nShow flashbacks of character->Show character's amazing plan how to win->Character dies a random, quick death. (You sit there afterwards and ask yourself what the hell has happend)->Show next episode's title which contains an animal and spoils the next death in the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nI have been watching it and hoping- Will the pattern break? And also, we are spoiled the order of the deaths, I do not want to spoil where, but once you see it and realize and doesn't break pattern and unlikely to.... You lose 80% of the enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nThe border story? None. They fight for a wish, that's it. Oh and there's some guy who started all this and introduces them in the first episode to that Juuni Taisen, we don't know who that guy is (....yet?).\\n\\n\r\nI wanna give props to the music (kinda), the OP and ED were top notch. The soundtrack.. Mostly forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nBut the art on the other hand... Went downhill real fast.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, my score is 4/10. And if you're looking for a Fate alternative, you better watch Kiss X Sis because at least it's better than Juuni Taisen.\\n",

            "content": "Some spoilers. \r\nIt's unbelievable how terrible this anime is. The premise of the show is that these 12 \"badass\" mercenary warriors each representing a zodiac animal are pitted against each other to fight to the death for the victory to be granted any wish much like that of the Fate series. The battle that takes place every 12 years (like the zodiac calendar) is supposed to be a war that replaces all other wars in the world to prevent the unnecessary loss of life, but yet the show constantly flashback to each warriors history of years of war experience. This completely contradicts the whole premise.\r\nWhilethe concept seems like it'd be fun to watch a bunch of people killing each other, the story telling aka plot progression completely ruins any enjoyment. It starts off with a interesting character you think is the protagonist by telling you the backstory and then kills them off. What a twist right? Then the show proceeds to replicate this formula for EVERY single character for the whole show. It's so predictable that there's no reason to even guess who's going to die next. Also these heroes are constantly dying in the dumbest ways to the point that each build up become anti-climactic. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know how anyone would think this was worth making into an anime. There's no character development and there's no concept of storytelling.",

            "content": "Every season nowadays, we get one of those \u201cdark, edgy\u201d shows that can make our stomach growl. From this year, we had plenty of those. Titles such as Kakegurui, Chaos;Child, and even Vatican Kiseki Chousakan tried to sell its ideas to viewers with mixed results. Then, there\u2019s Juuni Taisen, a show that features a battle royale theme. Based on the signs of the Eastern Zodiac, it\u2019 a character battle for the ultimate grand price of having a wish fulfilled. But honestly, Juuni Taisen is a show that betrayed expectations. It didn\u2019t fulfill my wish of a show that is memorable. Instead, it delivered a half-assedTV anime that makes headlines for the wrong reasons.\\n\\n\r\nJuuni Taisen is interesting to note for its creator, the brainchild behind the Monogatari novels. While that franchise takes on a more narrative approach, Juuni Taisen tried to do something different. It became a show that heavily focused on its characters, ones that I honestly found to have many problems by their standards. That\u2019s another subject by itself though. For this anime to succeed, it had to really get viewers invested into the story and be something unique of itself. Unfortunately, the battle royale theme is hardly original. The popular Fate franchise already had a similar premise while other shows in recent years also took on such an approach. (ex. Btooom, Mirai Nikki) What Juun Taisen failed to really do is not bringing in characters that are worth watching for but instead kills them off like they are some failed experiment. To say the least, that\u2019s just awful to realize.\\n\\n\r\nWatching this anime will probably get you to realize what it wants you to like. The bloodthirsty action, tragic drama, and emotional storytelling is what people should really expect from a show like this. Unfortunately, it only capitalizes on a small percent of that. Its straightforward storytelling is very predictable as you\u2019d expect from a battle royale theme show. Every time you see an episode filled with storytelling based on a certain character, almost always expect that character to die sooner or later. As for the storytelling itself, this show took a risk and it didn\u2019t truly pay off. Most of the characters in this anime has some sort of background story, motivation, and apparently goal for themselves. However, it doesn\u2019t really evoke any feelings in the end as it\u2019s hard to get attached to them. With perhaps the exception of the Tiger, almost every episode made me feel less sensitive about the characters. I don\u2019t feel much sympathy for them because there\u2019s really no point to after realizing what their fate awaits them. It\u2019s so predictable that you can almost guess exactly what may from scene to scene for some episodes. The worst offender is the Usagi (Rabbit) because this anime omits any sort of character development for him. He is literally portrayed as a psychotic abomination who tries to make \u201cfriends\u201d and enjoys the thrill of killing. It doesn\u2019t also help that the character lacks a personality and is there to fill the bloodthirsty action part of the show. By storytelling context, I do want to say that the show provides reasons for the battle royale itself and that there\u2019s a larger end-goal than just making a wish come true.\\n\\n\r\nIf you came for a show with graphic content, then this may end up being somewhat of a crowd-pleaser. The body horror, bloodshed, and overall psychology lives up to certain expectations. So really, if you plan to watch Juuni Taisen, you won\u2019t be disappointed for a show that offers its violence. I also have to add that through its battle royale theme, the show sometimes gets creative with how characters uses their approach to kill. While it\u2019s far from being an intelligent anime with strategies and clever psychology, some characters are deceptively cunning. The anime makes it clear that there will be one victor so death is something that you\u2019ll see often. The way these are carried out can occasionally be impressive despite the extreme predictably.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by studio Graphinica, I will admit that the overall visual quality gave me some favorable impressions. From the character introductions to the battle choreography, Juuni Taisen knows how to get viewers pumped up for some of its episodes. As dark and edgy as this show can be, it does live up to some expectations in regards to its technical content with graphic horror. Body parts are shredded, blood is spilled, and mentality is tested through facial character expressions. There isn\u2019t much censorship either. Tragic background stories has a black and white stylish tone that expresses a sense of vulnerability. Most of the animation also remains fluid without questionable raw quality. The character designs are interesting to take notice ranging from Usagi\u2019s man service to some of the sci-fi gimmicky outfits such as those wore by Tsumita siblings. The animal motifs and characteristics are also evident to represent the Chinese Zodiac.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to soundtrack delivery, there are several qualities that makes this barely watchable. First, the battle OST is far too generic. It just seems to be there and isn\u2019t unique by any standards. Second, there are the character voices. Some of them really doesn\u2019t make an impact while others are memorable just by their voice alone. The guiltiest example is Usagi, a character voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto. His voice from this show channels the craziest and ridiculous lines I\u2019ve seen from this show. On the other hand, the theme songs gives a feeling of melancholy and grimmer mood. I mean, it is a very moody anime after all.\\n\\n\r\nShould you really watch Juuni Taisen? As a light novel adaptation with 12 episodes, it\u2019s about as predictable as it can get. Expectations were shattered in pieces once you realize what you\u2019re in for. Beyond the predictably, the anime fails to get over most or if any of its character cast. Even when there are characters that you try to feel sympathy for, it ends up being wasted in the end. It\u2019s a show that I tried to accept for what it is but ended up being a dumb action flick that ran dead on its shoes.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Before the start of the fall anime season, Junni Taisen was one of the animes that caught my eye. The reason why is because it had the term Novel on what material it was adapted from. As in it wasn\u2019t a light novel series or a regular novel series, but rather it was one single novel. As in all it needed to do has been done, and all that\u2019s left is to adapt it to animation that has an ending in sight that will leave little to no loose ends. What started as mild intrigue was quickly overtaken with dissatisfaction as the first two episodesrolled around. \\n\\n\r\nJuuni taisen starts out in terms of its premise, as a very simple battle tournament between some of the best \u201cwarriors\u201d in the world. The gimmick in this story is that each the the contenders is representative of each of the chinese zodiac. Add on top of that a desolate city where the contenders can do whatever they want, and you have a formula for some fun. It may not be the most smartest of stories, but it has the ability to bring many great fighting scenes which sadly never becomes the case.\\n\\n\r\nBackstories and their utilization\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most noticeable aspects of this show, mostly because of how much time it takes from the show, is that it has a lot of backstories. Almost every episode has a backstory for one of the characters which is fine, I mean there are 12 characters and only 12 episodes worth of screen time for them. The problem is that each backstory is too long, and even worse is that it's the only shreds of characterization that we have for almost all the characters. I mean i\u2019m fine with backstories as a way to develop a character and give them more depth, but it should be used as the base not the entirety of the character. It\u2019s because of this that all the characters feel shallow, and it\u2019s difficult to get engaged with them which in turn removes a lot of tension that could have been given to the anime. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s also because of the overuse of backstory that during my time watching I began to wonder, how are backstories are used in a story? One of the answers i came to is the one i used a paragraph above, as a way to develop a character and give them some depth while serving as a base and point of reference for how far they have or haven\u2019t changed through the course of the story. It could as be used as a way for characters to interact as a way to sympathize or persuade each other, as well as the characters and readers getting a chance to know the characters. Now how are they are inserted into the story? Well as stated above it could be through character interaction, but another way is through characters reminiscing over their past. A majority of Junni Taisen\u2019s implementation of backstory is through reminiscing, which also becomes another of its faults. Reminiscing over your past is better used during the low points in the story when there is not much conflict and characters are allowed time to think about things without interruption. However since Junni taisen is mostly conflict it seems unreasonable for characters to think about their past, since they should be more busy thinking of strategy plans. It\u2019s only used properly twice and that\u2019s because it was before and after the battle royal, which is basically the low point, and it also does backstory via character interaction maybe once. All  other backstories feel hamfisted into the story as a way to give the characters some form of depth. They should have also thrown in a record scratch and a freeze frame before delving into their backstories because at least that would give them some value even if comedic. Even worse is what comes after each backstories that turn the show into a bore which leads to. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter focus and the wheel of predictability\\n\\n\r\nJunni Taisen doesn\u2019t really have a central that the story focuses on, but insteads puts focus on almost the entire cast, with each given an episode each. It did comes as quite the surprise during the first episode when only one character was given the most focus to, as well as a backstory, to the point that it was made to believe that they were the main character. Of course that thought was dashed away as they died in the very same episode. It was a nice subversion of expectations, but the problem is that it didn't go anywhere with this. It kept on doing the same thing over and over again with each character. If they are the main focus of the episode, and are given a backstory than they are likely to die soon. It may not be in the same episode, but they still die in a certain manner that holding back their death for an episode or 2 didn\u2019t really matter. Another thing to add on top of that is the order that the characters die. All you need to do is look at the chinese zodiac wheel and after the death of the three contenders, it\u2019s easy to see how the show is going to play out.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems that the people of the show were aware of the predictability of the show, and made heavy hints on how it will play out via the ending title, and the name of each episode. Even so it really adds nothing to the show. The show tells you what it\u2019s going to do and does it, and does nothing else. It\u2019s fine but leaves nothing for the viewers imagination, and removes even more tension from the show. With a predictable story and shallow characters, it\u2019s hard to see the point in the story as it drags on.\\n\\n\r\nthe fuckery of the junni taisen world\\n\\n\r\nThe world of juuni taisen doesn\u2019t make any fuckin sense. At first there wasn\u2019t much to the world other than a group of assassins wearing costumes corresponding to their zodiac animal meeting in the middle of a desolate city to duke it out in order to have their wishes granted by the host. Gimmicky and simple sure, but it allows for things to be straightforward and brush of things that are never explained such as, how are they able to fight in a city that seemed to be abandoned recently? Well if they are able to gather the best killers in the world than they must be stinkin rich which also could explain how they are able to grant a wish and have people evacuate the city, via money and power. However in the same first episode near the end magic is also introduced through the use of necromancy. So that leaves questions that weren\u2019t questioned now difficult to explain because now the wish and the the abandoned city could have been explained with magic or money, but it seems the writers weren\u2019t bothered now to actually explain it.\\n\\n\r\nSo now you have a world where there is some sort of magic in the world and the contenders are able to use them, but it seems that one ability is restricted to one character each. It\u2019s never explained why only one ability or how abilities such as theirs play in the world outside of people being assassins. It also leads to a power imbalance as it could be possible for one of the characters to have an op ability that can beat the rest of the contenders. \\n\\n\r\nI think the thing that bothered me more was the entire point of junni taisen was that it served as a proxy war so that unknown people can make bets to take counties, and the whole thing is just dumb. There\u2019s been enough flashbacks from the series to show us that there is still war between nations and fighting over land outside the battle royal. Is there going to be a change of government are borders going to be redrawn especially for something that happens every 12 years. Even then it\u2019s not like the citizens will be happy which can lead to civil unrest and rebellion.\\n\\n\r\nI was also going to go into the 12 families and the happenstance of the character aesthetics to their respective zodiac, but at this point it\u2019s too much. Basically as more about the juuni taisen world is shown the more convoluted and contradictory it really is. It looks like a bunch of things slapped together with not much thought in the big picture. \\n\\n\r\nProduction Value and other final thoughts\\n\\n\r\nThe production value during the beginning was fine to say the least. I liked the character designs of the warriors mostly because of how gimmicky they are just so they can be identifiable to their zodiac. Although backstory boars combat outfit looked nice as it had a metal gear look to it. The animation was smooth although it had a rough looked to it which i personally liked even some of the cg animation was good. But that\u2019s just the beginning as the quality in terms of both art and animation go down. Animation starts to look jagged and cg is used even though the characters are standing around which looks ridiculous. In terms of sound there\u2019s nothing to harp about as most of it was forgettable. Characters sound like how they\u2019re supposed to sound, and music play when it\u2019s suppose to, but nothing truly stands out.\\n\\n\r\nGoing into this show i was at least expecting some action shlock, but it seems that wasn't the case. There were interesting things in the show for sure such as the backstories which themselves could make interesting stories, but they are confined to this one. There was also some \u201cwitty\u201d writing when it came to the characters and what they represent, but nothing mind blowing. This is a show that said it will do a thing, did it, and nothing more.",

            "content": "This is an extremely fast-paced show so if you are the type of person that likes deep character development and to bond with the characters in a killing game story this might not be for you. If you are the type of person to like nonstop action with a small amount of character development you've come to the right place. Every episode we learn the short backstory of a character then we watch them fight.  The story itself is about 12 people representing the zodiac killing each other to retrieve a poisoned gem from each other bodies and then getting the one inside youtaken out upon victory. Somehow we have pacifists in this competition but that's not important. We don't know exactly why people showed up for this tournament but maybe we will learn. I do like any killing game plot and this is no different but I like character development also so I have a love hate relationship with this show maybe you won't.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is amazing as shows like this need good art because there is so much going on and people will drop janky and bad art like a sack of rocks. They have nothing to hide behind with this show and I appreciate the effort. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is also pretty nice and fits everything the show needs well. You know what you're getting just from the music used when it shows up. The voice acting is also pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said before we get a short backstory every episode for each character then we don't learn much more about them. I don't mean that as a bad thing though. So you can't make bonds with everyone except for maybe the pacifists if they live long enough. What I will pick out is the powers. Every character has an ability related to their zodiac even if it may not seem like it. the chicken can control birds, the boar holds ammo like a pig does it's slop with endless reloading so she never has to stop firing her gun as long as she has ammo like a pig never stop eating as long as they have food. The rabbit has necromancy so the people he kills does his bidding for him with their powers intact I don't know how to compare that one. The dog can control poisons I guess because dogs can sniff them out and etc.\\n\r\nI like the way they balance this powers out so no one is too overpowered even though all the dog has to do is sit around until everyone else dies since he is immune to poisons.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'm loving this anime and can't wait for a new episode every week especially since we have so many duds this season. I'm somewhat liking everything about this show and hope it keeps it up. They even keep you on your toes by throwing you things you may never expect.",

            "content": "Sometimes it is easy to grab a club and hit a series as hard as possible with an unconvincing criticism, and we forget that our tastes are not the same as those of the readers.\r\nThe plot is about a group of assassins (zodiac configuration) who joined a fight to death called Juuni Taisen, that's all.\r\nFirst, let me ask you something. What story do you expect from a fight to the death or deathmatch? All the characters will die, so the story is easy to follow. The substantial part of the spectacle is not in the fight against death itself; it is in the background fromthe secondary stories. Besides, all the personality, skills and reasons to be in the battle are explained in the secondary stories. Why should an author focus on the deathmatch, knowing the predictable outcome? The anime gives constant clues about WHO will die later, so pretending to be surprised by the plot is a big mistake. Do not have high hopes for the story, it is predictable but you can enjoy the small stories and the animation instead. Remember, it is not Death Note, Made in the Abyss, etc.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, \u00bfwhat will you expect from these characters? In summary, they all are assassins, murderers, most of them are psychopaths and antisocials so what background do you want to see? A killer lover of all living beings? \u00bfA killer, that have some morals and will cry at night for all the persons that died? They are not like Monkey, and that character was a killer as well. Please, do not overthink a deathmatch plot and do not try to explain it either with false and bold arguments.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is normal. The show is predictable.  Moreover,  for an animation studio is hard to invest a significant amount of money and time in some fights when the outcome is evident for the audience. Also, the chapters try to explain the character's perspective, so the animation used is acceptable for this purpose. On the other hand, the sound is typical, it helps with the fights and boosts the events but nothing more. The OP was ok.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the show gives the casual enjoyment when you watch any predictable show. For example, you could enjoy the character's short stories, but you already know the outcome, so you will feel a bit disappointed at the end because the show did not fulfill a more significant plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6.5 rounded 7.0\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the show has some remarkable short stories, but not all them are fascinating. The plot isn't hard to follow, and it is very predictable. However, the outcome fits the adaptation's objective and relinquish some information about the characters using short stories. Sadly, the pacing could be a problem because the time between the short story and the dead of the characters do not allow any further character progression. Besides, the show isn't as bad as some reviewers are trying to manifest. A lot of spectators will enjoy that genre and the story, but the show isn't fantastic either, so if you expect too much from it, you could receive a hit in the face.",

            "content": "I think this may be the most underrated anime of the season... but for good reason.\r\nJuuni Taisen is a battle royale anime, pitting 12 characters against each other in a fight to the death. A simple enough premise right? Every character is explored and as a result you do feel some connection or sympathy with a character when they die. And as its a Battle Royale, nearly every character... well dies. Written by the same writer of Katanagatari this anime is NOT meant to be a Mystery anime. People come into this show and somehow become upset when a character they like dies - ifyou can't stand shows like Game of Thrones or Breaking bad where characters that are built up die because thats the context of the world they are in, this show isn't for you.\\n\\n\r\nPutting aside the obvious which apparently needs to be said, this show is moreso like a character study instead of a pure action anime. When put into a situation like this, every soldier/warrior has a different creed/way of thinking that leads them to act the way they do both in everyday life and in this said situation. What makes this show incredibly enjoyable is that we get to see multiple perspectives of how to handle a situation like a Battle Royale with every character receiving a thoughtful depiction. Yes there is gore and yes there is violence, but stripped to its core Juuni Taisen is more like an episodic case study show of how characters would act/behave within the given world of Juuni Taisen.\\n\\n\r\nIts a fairly straightforward story -> Characters connive, plan, team up and kill. Art is alright. Only thing to really note is CGI is used for once in an anime fairly seamlessly within the show, which not many shows have been able to manage to pull off. Sound fits the show and helps with characterizations. Again, despite this being an action anime this show shines the most at being a set of individual character studies. Some of the other reviews here dislike the fact that characters they became attached to... well died. If you are willing to accept that fact, this becomes a thoroughly enjoyable show to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThis show isn't going to have you thinking about large philosophical questions like a Shinseaki Yori, but it does what it sets out to do. Provide a Battle Royale where every character is provided characterization and their methods/ideas are explored and examined. I would sincerely say this is one of the most enjoyable anime of this season.",

            "content": "Juuni Taisen is one of the best examples of a bonafide \"what if\" anime: What if the show was 24 instead of 12 episodes? What if the art and animation were more consistent? What if half the show wasn't pure flashbacks? What if the character deaths weren't so laughably predictable? I really could go on, and it's a shame imagining what could have been an outstanding show. \r\nThe anime is plagued by a myriad of small problems which by themselves would be insignificant and ignorable, but when you account for so many of them, it becomes detrimental to the viewing experience. On its surface, JuuniTaisen aspires to be an epic, exhilarating battle royale where 12 warriors representing the signs of the Chinese zodiac volunteer or are chosen to partake in the brawl, with the winner to be granted any one wish. \\n\\n\r\nNaturally, comparisons will be made to the Fate/Stay Night series, and while that juxtaposition isn't too far-fetched, Juuni Taisen is far more character driven and in that fact lies the show's greatest strengths and weaknesses. On principle, most of us can't get attached to characters if a said character received little to no screen time, or barely any development or backstory. To meet this principle, the anime dedicates one episode to most of the characters, where we see the conflict from their point of view and learn about their past. The problem here is that their backstory is told through an often intruding and abysmally long flash back that takes up the majority of their episode. I'm not one of those guys that hates flashbacks, heck I loved the original Naruto, but the difference here is that Naruto had dozens of episodes to tell its story and flesh out all its characters; Juuni Taisen does not have that time or liberty, so to see almost all of a character's screen time be dedicated to a flashback feels like a superfluous disservice to them, however effective it might have been to their development.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of disservice, one thing I'm sure that bothered others besides me was how suddenly the majority of the characters are killed off. About 80% of all the characters perish instantly to a sneak attack or die sacrificing themselves for another character. You can hardly call this an action anime if only 2 or 3 of the characters die fighting, while the others never really even got a chance to shine in the combat they so loved. Again, I'm not an action enthusiast, but if you're going to dump a huge flashback on us only to suddenly kill the character off afterwards, you've wasted any potential for growth that character might have had, as well as what could've been a great fight. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that leads to the other problem: Predicable deaths, very predictable deaths. The anime is very formulaic --- The episode focuses on one character, they get a 15 minute long flashback, and about 2 or 3 minutes after the flashback ends, they die, usually without a fight. While this isn't always the case, you can usually guess with surprising accuracy the next character to be killed off by just figuring out which character that previously got no screen time is suddenly getting lots and go from there. In this anime, flashbacks are the death flags, and screen time is the precursor to that. \\n\\n\r\nThe last bit of bad news if you're interested in this anime is the often wonky art and animation. It's all over the place to be honest, bouncing between amazing and sluggishly lazy. Honestly, at the times when the animation is downright jaw dropping, it only irks me even more for the lack of action scenes that could have greatly utilized it. Even the CGI is fluid and alive, might even be the best CGI I've seen in anime. But again, it all varies as sometimes the art devolves significantly past the point of saying its the anime's art style and just leaves me wondering \"why?\" But of all the negatives, this one is probably the most ignorable. \\n\\n\r\nAs for strengths, the biggest one is that its very character driven and knows how to make us care for characters in such a short amount of time, but it comes at the cost of the above negatives and due to the nature of the anime, the characters would not live long enough anyway to solidify a deep connection to. More episodes would have been amazing for this show, but we have to consume what we have been served. I can also say with certainty that not one of the problems I listed was enough to affect my overall positive enjoyment of the show, and my lower overall rating of 6 is  mostly due to objective critique. I'm a firm believer of watching a show for the enjoyment rather that to look to criticize it, so if the synopsis interests you at all, I still recommend you give it a try. Just bear in mind the above qualms and perhaps lower expectations accordingly.\\n\\n\r\nIn all, Juuni Taisen presents a simple yet effective story with compelling characters, though both of these are mired down by easy predictability and a lack of focus on action where there should be more of it. There was a lot of missed potential here, but at the same time it hit just enough right marks to distinguish itself as something truly unique in its field.",

From the start it's just 12 people, essentially and aesthetically bound by simbolysm ties which alone should haw rang a bell for anyone with more exposure to books rather than mainstream media.\r\nLooking at how the story is build around 12 episodes, there is almost no room for more world building or entertainment candy by prolonged character study and stretched EPIC fight visuals. It's bound to realism even with the fanatasy elements in it.  I couldeven call it cruel; how all aspects of life are finite in the end - if you are to strong, fights are one sided and quick, deception and technology can fight on equal grounds against the strong, but no matter how strong anybody gets, no one can be a one man army in the end. Thus, the value of the warrior lies in his led life of fighting, not in a single moments comfrontation with reality.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the stories achilles heel lies in the constrains of simbolysm it chose to delve into. You just can't igonore the hint's so blatantly put in your face and make assumtions on face value alone.

            "content": "Disclaimer: This review might contain spoilers on the anime \"Juuni Taisen\". Please excuse me if I make a mistake or you don't understand a part, as English is not my first language. Thank you.\r\nJuuni Taisen or How to Scam the Audience\r\nAs a fan of NisiOisiN it is uncomfortable to write this review. I still can not believe that Juuni Taisen, an anime based on his novel, could be so mediocre.\r\nAnd the worst thing is that at the beginning it looked promising. Everything seemed to point to this anime would be avant-garde to break with the clich\u00e9s of the formula \"Battle Royale\"; however, episode after episode,Juuni Taisen was transformed into a mess unable to maintain interest.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nSome characters so one-dimensional that, with some exceptions, it was impossible to connect with them; and a plot that folded to a totally predictable formula, killed any kind of suspense or mystery possible. In case anyone did not notice, the order of the deaths was the inverse of the order of the Chinese zodiac; and if that was very difficult to guess, the ending showed the sequence in all the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, what was initially innovative and unexpected, soon became a heavy and insipid structure. I mean the formula of showing a character's background right before he died. I have to admit, that even in the final episode itself I expected a plot twist that would justify everything, but no, that salvation never came.\\n\\n\r\nIt is supposed that the subject of this type of series is that each death is unexpected and that it is never known who will win until the end; nevertheless, Juuni Taisen decided to remove that suspense from the middle to focus on making a veiled criticism of the war?\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with that is that without suspense it is difficult to maintain interest. Not to mention that the characters have hardly any development and it is extremely difficult to empathize with them; not only because of its poor construction, but because just at the moment they develop a little they end up dying.\\n\\n\r\nAnd in the midst of that scenario, do you want to teach us that war is bad? Using cheap self-help book philosophy? With this panorama it was inevitable that this series would fail. A pity that a work of a great like NisiOisiN ends up happening without pain or glory.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, as in everything, there are exceptions, for example the Ox and the Tigress were two of the rescue characters; unfortunately they did not have more minutes on the screen. The rat could be another prominent character, especially for those last two episodes; however, his absence during more than 75% of the series made him lose all the weight he could potentially have.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the resolution was totally anticlimactic, which did not help at all to improve the series. Only the issue of desire in the final episode was a bit like raising the quality a little; however, in the end even that was handled horribly.\\n\\n\r\nFor that desire to forget everything had had an impact, it was necessary that the rat had more weight during the 12 episodes; If the audience had suffered their pain while living each path, for example, they would have had more connection with the boy and his predicament.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical section. The soundtrack only has the opening to highlight, but it is not to launch rockets; the rest of the music is totally forgettable. The animation started well, but soon it went to the floor, leaving a lot to be desired in the process.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the direction was frightening in every minute. There were hardly two or three sequences to remember and it was not because they had been first level, but because everything else gave pity. Character design is the only thing to be highlighted within the technical section; Here I must say that a very good job was done.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, a series that disappointed with a mediocre execution of a premise with enormous potential. If you have not seen it, do not even come near it. See you in the next review.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nA series with a huge potential that went to hell for a mediocre execution.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal rating\\n\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "I have observed some mixed opinions about Juuni Taisen (Zodiac War) during its airtime. Like that the plot is weak, it\u00b4s predictable, the fights are boring, the deaths are stupid, and the characters are scumbags with no development. And from the other side that it\u00b4s actually quite good, even great. That the characters are fairly interesting, with as much focus on their past, (with some interesting stories) as the actually death game. In my review I will give you my point of view on this, and how I perceived the whole show. \r\nI wouldn\u00b4t call the plot weak, just narrow. The premises are a deathbattle in 24 hours, based on the Twelve Zodiacs Hours. According to Chinese astrology, though not popularly used, a person\u2019s personality and life is more decided by his/her birth hour than year. So instead for each animal sign belonging to a specific sequence of years, it depends on which hour of the day you were born. Which is the case with the narrative of Juuni Tasien. Which explains the otherwise kind of weird age span of the characters, and how that is that dragon and snake can be twins. Knowing that is not a spoiler, whatever you google on it or not can be doe. In my point of view, Juuni Taisen delivered what it promised. You get to know why these battles are hold (whatever you find it interesting or believable is up to you), what the participants and organizers gain from it, and the battle setup. So, to me the plot isn\u00b4t weak, just very straight forward and narrow. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is predictable to some extent, but just as much it isn\u00b4t (don\u00b4t get fooled by the first 3-episode pattern). Yes, there are a major spoiler for who is going to die next included in the show, but not how and when they die. If you can live with that, this won\u00b4t be a problem for you. \\n\\n\r\nSince many probably signed up for Juuni Taisen due to the action tag, there is somethings that can be good to know in advance. The fights are short, intense, consume little airtime, and not your typically anime type of fights. You know, the type that can last a half of an episode, with the participants taking an immense amount of punishment, just for them to rise up again and keep fighting because of their \u201cstrong determination and will\u201d. You aren\u2019t going to find any of this in Juuni Taisen. The fights, battles and strategies in Juuni Taisen are a bit more \u201crealistic\u201d. Read me right, nothing about JT is quite realistic, but in the manor of how they play out. \\n\\n\r\nLet me clarify by Mike Tyson\u00b4s famous quote; \u201cEveryone has a plan until they get punched in the face\u201d. Which much align with how it works in Juuni Taisen. The characters are scheming, plotting, and planning, but as in real life, things seldom unfolds according to plan. There are factors that you forget to take in count, the misreading of a situation or opponent, the overestimation of your own abilities, or the underestimation of the opponent\u00b4s. The fights themselves is in my opinion often pretty interesting and nicely executed, I enjoyed them a lot, much due to what I mentioned above. You could clearly make out what of the things I mentioned above, went wrong when a character lost.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads me to the deaths. One might call some of them stupid, but I would call them human. The characters are often finding themselves in a situation where they get surprised, overwhelmed or hesitate a second to long, and end up dead because of it. If that isn\u00b4t typically human traits, I don\u00b4t know what is. Even the strongest, bravest, most experienced man can crack under too much mental pressure, which JT displays well. And the participants are for sure under much mental pressure, they are after all in a time limited death battle with only one winner outcome. If that doesn\u00b4t for fill your desire for \u201ccool\u201d deaths, well you may want to watch something else. \\n\r\nAs for the characters being scumbags, is absolutely partly true. A number of characters are really some of the worst scum the human race can offer, and some are far from it. With that said, I didn\u00b4t find any of the characters boring, quite the opposite. I found the depraved characters just as interesting as the rest. It\u00b4s a question of balance, and there did JT also delivered, its got the whole span of personalities. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the character development, let me first ask you a question. How much do you develop as a person during 24 hours? I myself, can say, that I probably doesn\u00b4t develop significantly much during that span of time. So, don\u00b4t expect any revolutionary character developments, this is the type of show that focuses more on how characters will act after their current state in life. \\n\\n\r\nWhich leads me to how the characters are handle together with the story. The plot can thoroughly be divided into two sets. Set one being the battle occurring in present time, and set two being the backgrounds of the characters, with set one and two mixing together from the start to the end. I liked the concept, which gave information about certain characters along the way, and at the same time pieced together their current place in the battle, or filled out the narrow plot with some good context. That made them feel more like persons then just war-robots. Tiger\u00b4s story was especially touching, and when put in with her role in the battle, it actually accounts as development for me. There\u00b4s a fair amount of time spent on dialogues and inner monologues, which let\u00b4s you get to know the characters and how they think. For the little time 12 characters have in just 12-episodes, I think most of them where quite fleshed out.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song \"Rupture\" by Panorama Panama Town, is in my opinion the best OP this season. The song and visuals are capturing the atmosphere of JT really well, and set me in the perfect mode for an episode. The ending song \"Keshin no Kemono\" by Do As Infinity, is equally as good, which round up that episode by showcasing the civil side of the warriors. The VA\u00b4s are well matched with their characters, and all preform their role to satisfaction. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the art and animation holds a high quality. Nice coloured and detailed backgrounds, fluent and intense action scenes, cool character designs, and fitting light settings. There are some parts where the quality drops (running out of budget?), but those scenes are pretty rare. \\n\\n\r\nSo, conclusion time. Juuni Tasien surprised me, and drew me in much more then I had expected. I enjoyed every episode, predictable or not. Some of the backstories were more touching than what one might expect for this type of show, and somewhat humanized the warriors a bit. I recommend this show to everyone who can live with the conditions I mentioned in this review, and won\u00b4t expect something similar to the Fate-series. The plot base is the same, but everything else has a completely different vibe. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoy your watch!  \\n",

            "content": "I never thought I would write a review, but here I am. I am writing this because too few people seem to get what this series is about.\r\nFirst of all, I have to say that if you only like action-comedy shounens, this is not a series for you. If you want just a lot of fight scenes and plot twists, watch something else.\r\nNow, let me explain why I liked Juuni Taisen.\r\nCharacters:\r\nWell, all the characters die in the expected order, and there aren't any major plot twists. In each episode, we get some backstory, a bit of fighting (I will talk about that later) and usuallya death. However, I can say that the backstories are well written. Not even one of them tries to be too tragic, and the characters vary from pacifists to thieves and psychopaths. However, most of them contain some tragedy, and some of them really touched my heart. I even cried one, which I really didn't expect to happen when I was watching this series.\\n\\n\r\nAction:\\n\r\nThe action isn't really a focal part of this show, but the animation is really well done. However, I was more impressed by a thing you don't really see anywhere else. In general, there are two types of fights: the classic direct power clash and the more indirect fights in which the opponents try to analyze the opponent's unique power ( the activation conditions, limits and weaknesses) and try to find a smart way to win. Juuni Taisen looks at first like it belongs to the second class, but it has a surprising element of realism added to the battles: almost all of the plans DON'T work. And they end up failing for some really simple reasons that the characters just overlooked. \\n\r\nFor some, it may sound anti-climactic, but I thought it was awesome how this anime showed just how quickly a life can end in battle.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack:\\n\r\nWell, I don't really know much about music, but I enjoyed the op, and the rest of the music was pretty good. Not one of the best, but good.\\n\\n\r\nNegative points:\\n\r\nI liked this anime from the beginning and around episode 10 I was thinking I might just give it a 10/11 (11 being the masterpieces). However, the last episode was just unsatisfying. Most of the people who are reading this are probably going to ignore my advice, but I am going to say it anyway: DON'T watch the last episode. Just pretend ep 11 is the conclusion. That is going to be much better. Or, at least, stop at the half point and imagine yourself what the winner asked for. I am going to say this again: DON'T watch the last episode till the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime a personal 9/11 and a recommendation to watch it only if you think you will enjoy it in the way that I described it.\\n\r\nYou can watch it legally for free on Crunchyroll.",

It is the formula that been used in many battle royale anime and so it also applies here. Who will win? Who will lose? But, most importantly, who will get the longest backstory? \r\nSo sit back, relax and \"Everybody, clap your hands!\" as I present to you the anime review for Juuni Taisen. Lets begin: \r\nStory: 6/10 \r\nSo like I said, the anime is aboutthe Juuni Taisen. A battle royale where 12 combatants compete to kill off each other in order to win the prize of having one wish of their desires; that's about it. Honestly you don't need to have a complex story for a premise that is this simple. You are given the premise and then you move on to see what happens next. It is the kind of story that develops depending on the actions of the characters and what they do to survive. \\n\\n\r\nNow one of the things that Juuni Taisen does that I like is that there is no true protagonist. Almost every character gets the light shine on them for an episode or two and we get to see how they plan to win the Juuni Taisen what actions they are planning to make. We also get to see what actions they took before they entered the Juuni Taisen to get an idea of kind of character they are in backsotries. The problem is that they can be inconsistent in terms of actually being interesting and length. While some are enjoyable to watch, some of them can be kind of boring. It doesn't help that sometimes that the backstories can take an entire episode to just tell us the lives of these characters and their morals. This doesn't help when you get these long backstories and then they get killed off quickly, leaving the viewer disappointment due to it feeling anticlimactic. This is mainly due to the mistakes that the characters make but more on that later. \\n\\n\r\nJuuni Taisen also likes to portray the battle royale as a literal war. The city that the anime is based in is a battlefield with soldiers in it; fighting each other in order to survive. Not to win, but to survive. Because by the end of the anime you get the message that there are no winners in war, only survivors. That is exactly what Juuni Taisen is trying to portray. It's not trying to be Fate or Future Diary, it is trying to be Juuni Taisen. But the message can be difficult to understand because the characters aren't really grounded in reality when they can do supernatural things that no normal human could, making it difficult to see that message. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nOne of the best things Juuni Taisen gets right is that it understands that a battle royale anime needs to have a diverse set of characters and thankfully it does. Juuni Taisen has a large variety in characters all representing an animal in the Chinese Zodiac Line. From the weird dressing but psychotic nature of Rabbit to the calm and collective nature of Ox to the carefree but kindhearted Tiger. These characters are interesting to watch and makes for good entertainment when their personalities clash together.....most of the time. Some characters can be one dimensional and uninteresting to watch, making their expected deaths less shocking. I'm not going to say who due to spoilers but they can be uninteresting. \\n\\n\r\nNow like I said earlier, their deaths are mainly caused by their mistakes because in war, you can't make mistakes otherwise you are dead. You make a mistake, you die, simple as that. This is something people tend to gloss over without thinking because it is an important factor. They can die because they were overconfident or they can die because they let their guard down. A couple of mistakes do happen multiple times but mainly they die because of the mistake they specifically made. However I do believe that the characters can still make these mistakes and still put on some good fights. There was only a couple of fights in the anime that were noteworthy as the rest ended very quickly. I think that it is a waste considering what these characters can do. These characters can control birds, levitate for no reason, see into different world lines (get it?) and resurrect the dead. It just feels wasteful and I believe that if the anime is not going to be really using all these abilities to the fullest, then they should have more grounded characters. It would certainly make its message about war more easy to understand. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 6.5/10 \\n\\n\r\nNow the overall animation can be rather inconsistent. But I must give credit where credit is due though, the fight scenes that are in the anime are well animated, especially in the earlier episodes. There is a lot of smooth action in them, especially since some of them are noticeably animated in 3D, making them an enjoyment to watch. The 3D animation doesn't hinder it and won't bother many people since its mainly animated in the standard 2D animation anyway. \\n\\n\r\nHowever the character designs, while being unique to represent their animal in the Chinese Zodiac line, are rather poorly animated. Most of the time they look like they've been poorly drawn as there are notable black lines in their designs, making them lack detail and look sloppy. This happens a lot in this anime and you will notice it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack most of the time didn't really stand out besides a couple of tracks at specific times. Most of the time it plays to itself to match the atmosphere and tone at that moment.  However I do want to give credit the OP and ED of this show. The opening, \"Rupture\" Panorama Panama Town is quite possibly one of my favourite OP this year. It has a nice calm rhythm and beat that you don't normally here in an anime opening. It matches the anime well as it is not really explosive and is trying to be different than other openings. However, its ending song, \"Keshin no Kemono\" by Do As Infinity, is the complete opposite. Its fast and loud which, again, is the complete opposite of what many other anime ED songs matches the anime well because because like the anime, it is trying to be different. \\n\\n\r\nI also want to give very quick praise to the dub as I do believe the voice actors do good jobs of capturing the characters personalities well. I specifically like Jerry Jewell as Usagi/Rabbit. While the Japanese voice actor makes Rabbit sound creepy, He makes Rabbit sound quirky and sometimes humorous which I like. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.8/10 Recommendation: \"Consider it\" \\n\\n\r\nLike I said, this show isn't trying to be Fate or Future Diary, it's trying to be Juuni Taisen. It wants to be its own thing and I respect it for it. This show is trying to portray the message that \"War is hell\" in the wise words of Jim Carry and it wants people to understand that. If you are looking for a show like Fate then you won't find it here but if you looking for something different in a battle royale anime then it is worth checking out. It is only 12 episodes long so it won't take you too long to watch.",

            "content": "Juuni Taisen is a very unique breed of anime. It's left me with more mixed feelings than most shows I can honestly think of. Some of it's good, some of it's bad and what we're left with is a very strange package to unwrap right before Christmas. Well, let me try and tackle this with some structure. \r\nThe three key things that define Juuni Taisen as a show are it's characters, it's thematic storytelling and it's anti climaxes. And all of them have their ups and downs.\r\nSo i'll start with characters. It's hard not to be immediately drawn in because all the characters have prettystellar designs, both visually and how they're written. None of the 12 participants feel interchangeable and clear work has gone into making them interesting and fun to watch. A lot of the good stuff in Juuni Taisen is just watching these characters interact and deal with one another across the show's runtime. We're given a decent amount of time to learn about most of their backstories, their motives and their goals and they work well with their actions.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the strength of these characters is cut short as, since this is a death game, the characters tend to die off very quickly before they can have any actual development in the show. Once you know a character's backstory, for the most part, it's just a countdown to when they'll die, so sometimes it can be hard to get attached to them, especially early characters. There are some exceptions to this, for instance Tiger is easily one of the more standout characters and Rat also have some development, but they're drops in a bucket. \\n\\n\r\nOnto the plot, the strength of it is definitely in the themes of the show. Every character having clearly defined goals and methods means their actions and even deaths are particularly fitting. It's nice as well that it's not drawn a huge amount of attention to and there to expand on for the more eagle eyed viewer who spies a cue in a certain backstory or in dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the plot itself is very bare bones and basic. It's your standard killing game affair with a rich group betting on it and somehow being able to grant wishes, none of which is given any detail. And on top of that, the plot does get predictable quickly, thanks to the show being based on the story of the Chinese Zodiac, if you're even vaguely aware of the story, you already know who the winner is and who will die in what order, which for a killing game is kind of detrimental. \\n\\n\r\nWhat will surprise about Juuni Taisen is its use of anticlimaxes, something not often seen in anime. These tend to be both good and bad, sometimes they will earnestly catch you off guard for how sudden an action is or how shocking an event was and other times you'll feel somewhat robbed of a potentially interesting payoff.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation itself can be pretty good when the show actually decides to use it, certain fight scenes later in the show are pretty good but unfortunately a lot of the actual 'animation' is just used on simple talking scenes and it's something of a shame because when fight scenes are present, they tend to be pretty good and make you want more. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, while I personally got some enjoyment out of Juuni Taisen, this is definitely not a show for everyone. I'd say give it the three episode rule and if you're enjoying the characters and can get over the predictable nature of the plot, it's a fun but bumpy ride right until the end. If you're just here for action and violent scenes, you'll get some of it, but probably not as much as you're craving. \\n\\n\r\nI'm glad I watched Juuni Taisen, but it's only getting a polite round of applause from me.",

I watched until ep 7). Also like the most helpful post said they just kill everyone then spit out of exposition(either before or after they die), itbarely lets you connect with the character if you even did connect with the character.",

            "content": "I'm sick and tired of seeing people treat Juuni Taisen like trash because the plot is predictable. \r\nIt might just be intentionally predictable!\r\nI know, how blasphemous! \r\nAs if its intention was to besmirch the name of our beloved Fate and the tarnish the genre it birthed into existence!\r\nDid it really take everyone 12 episodes to realize that the show reveals the order of every characters\u2019 death by the end of the first episode?\r\nWould it be so far-fetched to imagine that Juuni Taisen actually wanted to put an original spin on the battle royale genre? \r\nOr does every battle royale show have to be likeFate to be deemed \u201cgood\u201d? Don't get me wrong, I love Fate/Zero, but just because it's an exemplary entry in the genre doesn't mean every other show in it needs to be exactly like it. \\n\r\nInstead of trying to stand out with spectacular visuals, Juuni Taisen offers compelling characters and lots of new spins on the genre to keep you engaged.\\n\\n\r\nPositives:\\n\r\n+Exhilarating Music\\n\r\n+Interesting Character Backstories\\n\r\n+Tense Action\\n\r\n+Solid CGI\\n\r\n+Innovations to the Genre\\n\r\n+Grimdark Aesthetic\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\n-Lacking World Building\\n\r\n-Dragon and Snake's episodes\\n\r\n-Visual Quality Inconsistencies\\n\\n\r\n[Story: 6.5/10]\\n\r\nIn coming up with the score for the story I included both the actual plot and the way that the story is delivered because it is a crucial part of the experience.\\n\\n\r\nJuuni Taisen understands how predictable stories in the Battle Royale genre can be, and it plays with this idea of predictability. It\u2019s a show that acknowledges the nature of its genre, all of the opponents in a death game but one will die eventually. It rubs its predictability in your face and forces you not try to figure out who will die next, but to analyze the show\u2019s other aspects. Namely, the characters, but we\u2019ll cross that bridge when we get there. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the setting and plot themselves, they are fairly barebones but sturdy enough to hold up the exciting action and character stories. Whenever the show draws attention to the behind the scenes of the zodiac war it feels very apparent that it\u2019s the most undercooked part of the show. Occasionally we see anonymous bidders watching the battle, but there is little reason for these segments other than showing us important people view the game as a form of entertainment. In the backstories side characters offhandedly mentioning how the zodiac war is some myth that is typically referred to as very important, but that doesn\u2019t come across at all during the actual war itself, as it mostly focuses on the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe city that the competitors battle in is entirely devoid of life, with little explanation to the why and how. Characters have special powers connected to their zodiacs, although the powers are cool and well implemented into the action they have no explanation for their existence in the real world. Very little of the actual plot is clear, but each character\u2019s backstory is enough to make up for its issues. The backstories worked so well to get me invested that whenever the characters engaged in combat I was on the edge of my seat hoping for the more developed character to survive despite knowing the inevitable would come. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending will no doubt disappoint some people, but its tameness didn't bother me. For me, it concluded the characters' stories in a satisfying way and it gave me everything I expected from the ending.\\n\\n\r\n[Character: 8/10]\\n\r\nMost of the entertainment from Juuni Taisen comes from the characters, as you\u2019d expect from a battle royale show with a paper-thin plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe cutthroat cast of twelve mercenaries/warriors are each represented by one of the twelve zodiac signs. Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Boar. They all have special abilities related to their sign which are revealed over time, another mystery that adds a layer of tension to the thrilling atmosphere. Even their deaths are directly tied to their zodiac sign. This opens another avenue for analyzing each character, and frankly, it's not surprising to see a writer as impressive as Nisio Isin try to innovate the battle royale genre like this. Also, they\u2019re all edgy as hell. All of them, it's funny how on point they are to the edgy battle royale genre style the show is aiming for and successfully hitting it. Their personalities are all very distinct and are represented by their character designs. Their designs also have elements that represent their zodiac sign. Whether it be Usagi\u2019s bunny ears and high heels or Niwatori\u2019s chicken style outfit and pitchfork for a weapon. They all look absurd and have the strong personalities and backstories to justify their designs.  \\n\\n\r\nTheir personalities are quite overdone, but once you see the explanation for why they behave the way they do you\u2019ll be more inclined to embrace them. Although a couple of the character backstories didn\u2019t quite do it for me (namely Dragon and Snake) because of their stories, while funny and full of action, blatantly disregarded what made the other character so well developed. Even with all the absurdity, a majority of the challengers evoke empathy from their backstories and make you think, oh now I get why that character is trying so hard to look cool. At first, they\u2019re vicious killing machines, then the show makes you pity them and you'll become endeared in their struggle to win, no matter how futile it may be.\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 6.5/10]\\n\r\nThe quality of the art and animation varies, it starts off great but has a noticeable drop-off in quality in the later episodes. While in the actual present-day Zodiac War the visuals are quite good, solid character art, a dark and moody desolate city, and sometimes really great battle animation. During the flashbacks is where the art quality starts to drop. In the early episodes the art and animations look good all around, but as the episodes go by the flashbacks have noticeably less motion and become mostly conversation scenes. Not to say that the conversations aren\u2019t interesting, but the show is at its best during the high stakes action.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s understandable that the budget isn\u2019t huge considering it\u2019s a new story from a fairly small studio. I can commend Graphinica for subtly swapping the art style to CGI to save funds in the later episodes because of how great it looks. Don't expect to see low frames CGI like what we got with Ajin in this show. Graphinica previously worked a fairly good looking CGI movie, Expelled from Paradise, so it\u2019s great to see that they\u2019ve only gotten better through practice. I didn\u2019t struggle to forgive the issues with the visuals while watching the show, but I have to knock it a few points for some distracting quality dips during the middle episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe greatest saving grace of the show's visuals is its grimdark aesthetic. You might just call this \"edge\" and you'd be right, but it's consistent edge that is totally in keeping with the rest of the show. Scenes are full of shadows, dark colors, and the fact that the war takes place during mostly the nighttime with rain and clouds during the day. Every aspect of the show contributes to this style and the visuals pull plenty of the weight. While the art is far from perfect, I can say it makes up for enough of its flaws with a memorable personality.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 8.5/10]\\n\r\nA nice tense soundtrack that gets the blood pumping during action sequences. It ranges from orchestral music to EDM and I liked all of it. It\u2019s also present during the slower scenes where characters are conversing to add a layer of tension, reminding you that they have to kill each other as soon as they finish talking. There are times it strikes the audience with some more sad songs to hammering home the brevity of some of the show's tragic situations. I feel safe saying it's one of the best OSTs of the season, as well as having a great alternative rock OP. The ed has a good song that\u2019s more subdued than the show that precedes it.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is good across all 12 contestants and there's a dub as well that's not as good as the Japanese voice acting but it's nice to have the option.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 9/10]\\n\r\nDespite having exciting action, a majority of the show\u2019s screen time is flashbacks and talking scenes. I liked a lot of the backstories, but as I said earlier not all of them are interesting. Your mileage may vary when it comes to enjoying Juuni Taisen, I really liked it but it may not be for everyone. If you can embrace the edginess regardless of the absurd plot then you\u2019ll probably find it to be an enthralling watch.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Score: 7.7/10]\\n\r\nYou know how Fate Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works has great visuals but it leans on them so hard because it has almost nothing else noteworthy going on? Well, Juuni Taisen doesn\u2019t have the luxury of being able to slack off because its visuals aren\u2019t anything to write home about, that's why it devotes so much time to its characters and offers up some intriguing hooks. In the end, it\u2019s just a good time. If you go into it expecting Fate you\u2019ll be disappointed.",

Everything was so stupid here that it might've been better to just make it a comedy anime.

But it went downhill really fast.\r\nI'm going to talk about the pattern of the anime, which makes almost every episode the same, the poor \"border story\" and why the anime which is tagged only as \"Action\"- doesn't doanything interesting with action. Minor spoilers but I do not specify names.\\n\\n\r\nSo, when I first saw Juuni Taisen, I got hyped \"Another Fate? Sounds cool!\" and the story is pretty simple. 12 fighters, 1 wish, fight to death, last one standing (probably).\\n\\n\r\nWhere did it fall off? Basically at the end of the first episode, but you only realize it later.\\n\\n\r\nJuuni Taisen repeats a pretty bad pattern for almost every episode.\\n\\n\r\nShow flashbacks of character->Show character's amazing plan how to win->Character dies a random, quick death. (You sit there afterwards and ask yourself what the hell has happend)->Show next episode's title which contains an animal and spoils the next death in the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nI have been watching it and hoping- Will the pattern break? And also, we are spoiled the order of the deaths, I do not want to spoil where, but once you see it and realize and doesn't break pattern and unlikely to.... You lose 80% of the enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nThe border story? None. They fight for a wish, that's it. Oh and there's some guy who started all this and introduces them in the first episode to that Juuni Taisen, we don't know who that guy is (....yet?).\\n\\n\r\nI wanna give props to the music (kinda), the OP and ED were top notch. The soundtrack.. Mostly forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nBut the art on the other hand... Went downhill real fast.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, my score is 4/10. And if you're looking for a Fate alternative, you better watch Kiss X Sis because at least it's better than Juuni Taisen.\\n",

            "content": "Some spoilers. \r\nIt's unbelievable how terrible this anime is. The premise of the show is that these 12 \"badass\" mercenary warriors each representing a zodiac animal are pitted against each other to fight to the death for the victory to be granted any wish much like that of the Fate series. The battle that takes place every 12 years (like the zodiac calendar) is supposed to be a war that replaces all other wars in the world to prevent the unnecessary loss of life, but yet the show constantly flashback to each warriors history of years of war experience. This completely contradicts the whole premise.\r\nWhilethe concept seems like it'd be fun to watch a bunch of people killing each other, the story telling aka plot progression completely ruins any enjoyment. It starts off with a interesting character you think is the protagonist by telling you the backstory and then kills them off. What a twist right? Then the show proceeds to replicate this formula for EVERY single character for the whole show. It's so predictable that there's no reason to even guess who's going to die next. Also these heroes are constantly dying in the dumbest ways to the point that each build up become anti-climactic. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know how anyone would think this was worth making into an anime. There's no character development and there's no concept of storytelling.",

            "content": "Every season nowadays, we get one of those \u201cdark, edgy\u201d shows that can make our stomach growl. From this year, we had plenty of those. Titles such as Kakegurui, Chaos;Child, and even Vatican Kiseki Chousakan tried to sell its ideas to viewers with mixed results. Then, there\u2019s Juuni Taisen, a show that features a battle royale theme. Based on the signs of the Eastern Zodiac, it\u2019 a character battle for the ultimate grand price of having a wish fulfilled. But honestly, Juuni Taisen is a show that betrayed expectations. It didn\u2019t fulfill my wish of a show that is memorable. Instead, it delivered a half-assedTV anime that makes headlines for the wrong reasons.\\n\\n\r\nJuuni Taisen is interesting to note for its creator, the brainchild behind the Monogatari novels. While that franchise takes on a more narrative approach, Juuni Taisen tried to do something different. It became a show that heavily focused on its characters, ones that I honestly found to have many problems by their standards. That\u2019s another subject by itself though. For this anime to succeed, it had to really get viewers invested into the story and be something unique of itself. Unfortunately, the battle royale theme is hardly original. The popular Fate franchise already had a similar premise while other shows in recent years also took on such an approach. (ex. Btooom, Mirai Nikki) What Juun Taisen failed to really do is not bringing in characters that are worth watching for but instead kills them off like they are some failed experiment. To say the least, that\u2019s just awful to realize.\\n\\n\r\nWatching this anime will probably get you to realize what it wants you to like. The bloodthirsty action, tragic drama, and emotional storytelling is what people should really expect from a show like this. Unfortunately, it only capitalizes on a small percent of that. Its straightforward storytelling is very predictable as you\u2019d expect from a battle royale theme show. Every time you see an episode filled with storytelling based on a certain character, almost always expect that character to die sooner or later. As for the storytelling itself, this show took a risk and it didn\u2019t truly pay off. Most of the characters in this anime has some sort of background story, motivation, and apparently goal for themselves. However, it doesn\u2019t really evoke any feelings in the end as it\u2019s hard to get attached to them. With perhaps the exception of the Tiger, almost every episode made me feel less sensitive about the characters. I don\u2019t feel much sympathy for them because there\u2019s really no point to after realizing what their fate awaits them. It\u2019s so predictable that you can almost guess exactly what may from scene to scene for some episodes. The worst offender is the Usagi (Rabbit) because this anime omits any sort of character development for him. He is literally portrayed as a psychotic abomination who tries to make \u201cfriends\u201d and enjoys the thrill of killing. It doesn\u2019t also help that the character lacks a personality and is there to fill the bloodthirsty action part of the show. By storytelling context, I do want to say that the show provides reasons for the battle royale itself and that there\u2019s a larger end-goal than just making a wish come true.\\n\\n\r\nIf you came for a show with graphic content, then this may end up being somewhat of a crowd-pleaser. The body horror, bloodshed, and overall psychology lives up to certain expectations. So really, if you plan to watch Juuni Taisen, you won\u2019t be disappointed for a show that offers its violence. I also have to add that through its battle royale theme, the show sometimes gets creative with how characters uses their approach to kill. While it\u2019s far from being an intelligent anime with strategies and clever psychology, some characters are deceptively cunning. The anime makes it clear that there will be one victor so death is something that you\u2019ll see often. The way these are carried out can occasionally be impressive despite the extreme predictably.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by studio Graphinica, I will admit that the overall visual quality gave me some favorable impressions. From the character introductions to the battle choreography, Juuni Taisen knows how to get viewers pumped up for some of its episodes. As dark and edgy as this show can be, it does live up to some expectations in regards to its technical content with graphic horror. Body parts are shredded, blood is spilled, and mentality is tested through facial character expressions. There isn\u2019t much censorship either. Tragic background stories has a black and white stylish tone that expresses a sense of vulnerability. Most of the animation also remains fluid without questionable raw quality. The character designs are interesting to take notice ranging from Usagi\u2019s man service to some of the sci-fi gimmicky outfits such as those wore by Tsumita siblings. The animal motifs and characteristics are also evident to represent the Chinese Zodiac.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to soundtrack delivery, there are several qualities that makes this barely watchable. First, the battle OST is far too generic. It just seems to be there and isn\u2019t unique by any standards. Second, there are the character voices. Some of them really doesn\u2019t make an impact while others are memorable just by their voice alone. The guiltiest example is Usagi, a character voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto. His voice from this show channels the craziest and ridiculous lines I\u2019ve seen from this show. On the other hand, the theme songs gives a feeling of melancholy and grimmer mood. I mean, it is a very moody anime after all.\\n\\n\r\nShould you really watch Juuni Taisen? As a light novel adaptation with 12 episodes, it\u2019s about as predictable as it can get. Expectations were shattered in pieces once you realize what you\u2019re in for. Beyond the predictably, the anime fails to get over most or if any of its character cast. Even when there are characters that you try to feel sympathy for, it ends up being wasted in the end. It\u2019s a show that I tried to accept for what it is but ended up being a dumb action flick that ran dead on its shoes.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Before the start of the fall anime season, Junni Taisen was one of the animes that caught my eye. The reason why is because it had the term Novel on what material it was adapted from. As in it wasn\u2019t a light novel series or a regular novel series, but rather it was one single novel. As in all it needed to do has been done, and all that\u2019s left is to adapt it to animation that has an ending in sight that will leave little to no loose ends. What started as mild intrigue was quickly overtaken with dissatisfaction as the first two episodesrolled around. \\n\\n\r\nJuuni taisen starts out in terms of its premise, as a very simple battle tournament between some of the best \u201cwarriors\u201d in the world. The gimmick in this story is that each the the contenders is representative of each of the chinese zodiac. Add on top of that a desolate city where the contenders can do whatever they want, and you have a formula for some fun. It may not be the most smartest of stories, but it has the ability to bring many great fighting scenes which sadly never becomes the case.\\n\\n\r\nBackstories and their utilization\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most noticeable aspects of this show, mostly because of how much time it takes from the show, is that it has a lot of backstories. Almost every episode has a backstory for one of the characters which is fine, I mean there are 12 characters and only 12 episodes worth of screen time for them. The problem is that each backstory is too long, and even worse is that it's the only shreds of characterization that we have for almost all the characters. I mean i\u2019m fine with backstories as a way to develop a character and give them more depth, but it should be used as the base not the entirety of the character. It\u2019s because of this that all the characters feel shallow, and it\u2019s difficult to get engaged with them which in turn removes a lot of tension that could have been given to the anime. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s also because of the overuse of backstory that during my time watching I began to wonder, how are backstories are used in a story? One of the answers i came to is the one i used a paragraph above, as a way to develop a character and give them some depth while serving as a base and point of reference for how far they have or haven\u2019t changed through the course of the story. It could as be used as a way for characters to interact as a way to sympathize or persuade each other, as well as the characters and readers getting a chance to know the characters. Now how are they are inserted into the story? Well as stated above it could be through character interaction, but another way is through characters reminiscing over their past. A majority of Junni Taisen\u2019s implementation of backstory is through reminiscing, which also becomes another of its faults. Reminiscing over your past is better used during the low points in the story when there is not much conflict and characters are allowed time to think about things without interruption. However since Junni taisen is mostly conflict it seems unreasonable for characters to think about their past, since they should be more busy thinking of strategy plans. It\u2019s only used properly twice and that\u2019s because it was before and after the battle royal, which is basically the low point, and it also does backstory via character interaction maybe once. All  other backstories feel hamfisted into the story as a way to give the characters some form of depth. They should have also thrown in a record scratch and a freeze frame before delving into their backstories because at least that would give them some value even if comedic. Even worse is what comes after each backstories that turn the show into a bore which leads to. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter focus and the wheel of predictability\\n\\n\r\nJunni Taisen doesn\u2019t really have a central that the story focuses on, but insteads puts focus on almost the entire cast, with each given an episode each. It did comes as quite the surprise during the first episode when only one character was given the most focus to, as well as a backstory, to the point that it was made to believe that they were the main character. Of course that thought was dashed away as they died in the very same episode. It was a nice subversion of expectations, but the problem is that it didn't go anywhere with this. It kept on doing the same thing over and over again with each character. If they are the main focus of the episode, and are given a backstory than they are likely to die soon. It may not be in the same episode, but they still die in a certain manner that holding back their death for an episode or 2 didn\u2019t really matter. Another thing to add on top of that is the order that the characters die. All you need to do is look at the chinese zodiac wheel and after the death of the three contenders, it\u2019s easy to see how the show is going to play out.\\n\\n\r\nIt seems that the people of the show were aware of the predictability of the show, and made heavy hints on how it will play out via the ending title, and the name of each episode. Even so it really adds nothing to the show. The show tells you what it\u2019s going to do and does it, and does nothing else. It\u2019s fine but leaves nothing for the viewers imagination, and removes even more tension from the show. With a predictable story and shallow characters, it\u2019s hard to see the point in the story as it drags on.\\n\\n\r\nthe fuckery of the junni taisen world\\n\\n\r\nThe world of juuni taisen doesn\u2019t make any fuckin sense. At first there wasn\u2019t much to the world other than a group of assassins wearing costumes corresponding to their zodiac animal meeting in the middle of a desolate city to duke it out in order to have their wishes granted by the host. Gimmicky and simple sure, but it allows for things to be straightforward and brush of things that are never explained such as, how are they able to fight in a city that seemed to be abandoned recently? Well if they are able to gather the best killers in the world than they must be stinkin rich which also could explain how they are able to grant a wish and have people evacuate the city, via money and power. However in the same first episode near the end magic is also introduced through the use of necromancy. So that leaves questions that weren\u2019t questioned now difficult to explain because now the wish and the the abandoned city could have been explained with magic or money, but it seems the writers weren\u2019t bothered now to actually explain it.\\n\\n\r\nSo now you have a world where there is some sort of magic in the world and the contenders are able to use them, but it seems that one ability is restricted to one character each. It\u2019s never explained why only one ability or how abilities such as theirs play in the world outside of people being assassins. It also leads to a power imbalance as it could be possible for one of the characters to have an op ability that can beat the rest of the contenders. \\n\\n\r\nI think the thing that bothered me more was the entire point of junni taisen was that it served as a proxy war so that unknown people can make bets to take counties, and the whole thing is just dumb. There\u2019s been enough flashbacks from the series to show us that there is still war between nations and fighting over land outside the battle royal. Is there going to be a change of government are borders going to be redrawn especially for something that happens every 12 years. Even then it\u2019s not like the citizens will be happy which can lead to civil unrest and rebellion.\\n\\n\r\nI was also going to go into the 12 families and the happenstance of the character aesthetics to their respective zodiac, but at this point it\u2019s too much. Basically as more about the juuni taisen world is shown the more convoluted and contradictory it really is. It looks like a bunch of things slapped together with not much thought in the big picture. \\n\\n\r\nProduction Value and other final thoughts\\n\\n\r\nThe production value during the beginning was fine to say the least. I liked the character designs of the warriors mostly because of how gimmicky they are just so they can be identifiable to their zodiac. Although backstory boars combat outfit looked nice as it had a metal gear look to it. The animation was smooth although it had a rough looked to it which i personally liked even some of the cg animation was good. But that\u2019s just the beginning as the quality in terms of both art and animation go down. Animation starts to look jagged and cg is used even though the characters are standing around which looks ridiculous. In terms of sound there\u2019s nothing to harp about as most of it was forgettable. Characters sound like how they\u2019re supposed to sound, and music play when it\u2019s suppose to, but nothing truly stands out.\\n\\n\r\nGoing into this show i was at least expecting some action shlock, but it seems that wasn't the case. There were interesting things in the show for sure such as the backstories which themselves could make interesting stories, but they are confined to this one. There was also some \u201cwitty\u201d writing when it came to the characters and what they represent, but nothing mind blowing. This is a show that said it will do a thing, did it, and nothing more.",

            "content": "This is an extremely fast-paced show so if you are the type of person that likes deep character development and to bond with the characters in a killing game story this might not be for you. If you are the type of person to like nonstop action with a small amount of character development you've come to the right place. Every episode we learn the short backstory of a character then we watch them fight.  The story itself is about 12 people representing the zodiac killing each other to retrieve a poisoned gem from each other bodies and then getting the one inside youtaken out upon victory. Somehow we have pacifists in this competition but that's not important. We don't know exactly why people showed up for this tournament but maybe we will learn. I do like any killing game plot and this is no different but I like character development also so I have a love hate relationship with this show maybe you won't.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is amazing as shows like this need good art because there is so much going on and people will drop janky and bad art like a sack of rocks. They have nothing to hide behind with this show and I appreciate the effort. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is also pretty nice and fits everything the show needs well. You know what you're getting just from the music used when it shows up. The voice acting is also pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nLike I said before we get a short backstory every episode for each character then we don't learn much more about them. I don't mean that as a bad thing though. So you can't make bonds with everyone except for maybe the pacifists if they live long enough. What I will pick out is the powers. Every character has an ability related to their zodiac even if it may not seem like it. the chicken can control birds, the boar holds ammo like a pig does it's slop with endless reloading so she never has to stop firing her gun as long as she has ammo like a pig never stop eating as long as they have food. The rabbit has necromancy so the people he kills does his bidding for him with their powers intact I don't know how to compare that one. The dog can control poisons I guess because dogs can sniff them out and etc.\\n\r\nI like the way they balance this powers out so no one is too overpowered even though all the dog has to do is sit around until everyone else dies since he is immune to poisons.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'm loving this anime and can't wait for a new episode every week especially since we have so many duds this season. I'm somewhat liking everything about this show and hope it keeps it up. They even keep you on your toes by throwing you things you may never expect.",

            "content": "Sometimes it is easy to grab a club and hit a series as hard as possible with an unconvincing criticism, and we forget that our tastes are not the same as those of the readers.\r\nThe plot is about a group of assassins (zodiac configuration) who joined a fight to death called Juuni Taisen, that's all.\r\nFirst, let me ask you something. What story do you expect from a fight to the death or deathmatch? All the characters will die, so the story is easy to follow. The substantial part of the spectacle is not in the fight against death itself; it is in the background fromthe secondary stories. Besides, all the personality, skills and reasons to be in the battle are explained in the secondary stories. Why should an author focus on the deathmatch, knowing the predictable outcome? The anime gives constant clues about WHO will die later, so pretending to be surprised by the plot is a big mistake. Do not have high hopes for the story, it is predictable but you can enjoy the small stories and the animation instead. Remember, it is not Death Note, Made in the Abyss, etc.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, \u00bfwhat will you expect from these characters? In summary, they all are assassins, murderers, most of them are psychopaths and antisocials so what background do you want to see? A killer lover of all living beings? \u00bfA killer, that have some morals and will cry at night for all the persons that died? They are not like Monkey, and that character was a killer as well. Please, do not overthink a deathmatch plot and do not try to explain it either with false and bold arguments.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is normal. The show is predictable.  Moreover,  for an animation studio is hard to invest a significant amount of money and time in some fights when the outcome is evident for the audience. Also, the chapters try to explain the character's perspective, so the animation used is acceptable for this purpose. On the other hand, the sound is typical, it helps with the fights and boosts the events but nothing more. The OP was ok.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the show gives the casual enjoyment when you watch any predictable show. For example, you could enjoy the character's short stories, but you already know the outcome, so you will feel a bit disappointed at the end because the show did not fulfill a more significant plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6.5 rounded 7.0\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the show has some remarkable short stories, but not all them are fascinating. The plot isn't hard to follow, and it is very predictable. However, the outcome fits the adaptation's objective and relinquish some information about the characters using short stories. Sadly, the pacing could be a problem because the time between the short story and the dead of the characters do not allow any further character progression. Besides, the show isn't as bad as some reviewers are trying to manifest. A lot of spectators will enjoy that genre and the story, but the show isn't fantastic either, so if you expect too much from it, you could receive a hit in the face.",

            "content": "I think this may be the most underrated anime of the season... but for good reason.\r\nJuuni Taisen is a battle royale anime, pitting 12 characters against each other in a fight to the death. A simple enough premise right? Every character is explored and as a result you do feel some connection or sympathy with a character when they die. And as its a Battle Royale, nearly every character... well dies. Written by the same writer of Katanagatari this anime is NOT meant to be a Mystery anime. People come into this show and somehow become upset when a character they like dies - ifyou can't stand shows like Game of Thrones or Breaking bad where characters that are built up die because thats the context of the world they are in, this show isn't for you.\\n\\n\r\nPutting aside the obvious which apparently needs to be said, this show is moreso like a character study instead of a pure action anime. When put into a situation like this, every soldier/warrior has a different creed/way of thinking that leads them to act the way they do both in everyday life and in this said situation. What makes this show incredibly enjoyable is that we get to see multiple perspectives of how to handle a situation like a Battle Royale with every character receiving a thoughtful depiction. Yes there is gore and yes there is violence, but stripped to its core Juuni Taisen is more like an episodic case study show of how characters would act/behave within the given world of Juuni Taisen.\\n\\n\r\nIts a fairly straightforward story -> Characters connive, plan, team up and kill. Art is alright. Only thing to really note is CGI is used for once in an anime fairly seamlessly within the show, which not many shows have been able to manage to pull off. Sound fits the show and helps with characterizations. Again, despite this being an action anime this show shines the most at being a set of individual character studies. Some of the other reviews here dislike the fact that characters they became attached to... well died. If you are willing to accept that fact, this becomes a thoroughly enjoyable show to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThis show isn't going to have you thinking about large philosophical questions like a Shinseaki Yori, but it does what it sets out to do. Provide a Battle Royale where every character is provided characterization and their methods/ideas are explored and examined. I would sincerely say this is one of the most enjoyable anime of this season.",

            "content": "Juuni Taisen is one of the best examples of a bonafide \"what if\" anime: What if the show was 24 instead of 12 episodes? What if the art and animation were more consistent? What if half the show wasn't pure flashbacks? What if the character deaths weren't so laughably predictable? I really could go on, and it's a shame imagining what could have been an outstanding show. \r\nThe anime is plagued by a myriad of small problems which by themselves would be insignificant and ignorable, but when you account for so many of them, it becomes detrimental to the viewing experience. On its surface, JuuniTaisen aspires to be an epic, exhilarating battle royale where 12 warriors representing the signs of the Chinese zodiac volunteer or are chosen to partake in the brawl, with the winner to be granted any one wish. \\n\\n\r\nNaturally, comparisons will be made to the Fate/Stay Night series, and while that juxtaposition isn't too far-fetched, Juuni Taisen is far more character driven and in that fact lies the show's greatest strengths and weaknesses. On principle, most of us can't get attached to characters if a said character received little to no screen time, or barely any development or backstory. To meet this principle, the anime dedicates one episode to most of the characters, where we see the conflict from their point of view and learn about their past. The problem here is that their backstory is told through an often intruding and abysmally long flash back that takes up the majority of their episode. I'm not one of those guys that hates flashbacks, heck I loved the original Naruto, but the difference here is that Naruto had dozens of episodes to tell its story and flesh out all its characters; Juuni Taisen does not have that time or liberty, so to see almost all of a character's screen time be dedicated to a flashback feels like a superfluous disservice to them, however effective it might have been to their development.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of disservice, one thing I'm sure that bothered others besides me was how suddenly the majority of the characters are killed off. About 80% of all the characters perish instantly to a sneak attack or die sacrificing themselves for another character. You can hardly call this an action anime if only 2 or 3 of the characters die fighting, while the others never really even got a chance to shine in the combat they so loved. Again, I'm not an action enthusiast, but if you're going to dump a huge flashback on us only to suddenly kill the character off afterwards, you've wasted any potential for growth that character might have had, as well as what could've been a great fight. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that leads to the other problem: Predicable deaths, very predictable deaths. The anime is very formulaic --- The episode focuses on one character, they get a 15 minute long flashback, and about 2 or 3 minutes after the flashback ends, they die, usually without a fight. While this isn't always the case, you can usually guess with surprising accuracy the next character to be killed off by just figuring out which character that previously got no screen time is suddenly getting lots and go from there. In this anime, flashbacks are the death flags, and screen time is the precursor to that. \\n\\n\r\nThe last bit of bad news if you're interested in this anime is the often wonky art and animation. It's all over the place to be honest, bouncing between amazing and sluggishly lazy. Honestly, at the times when the animation is downright jaw dropping, it only irks me even more for the lack of action scenes that could have greatly utilized it. Even the CGI is fluid and alive, might even be the best CGI I've seen in anime. But again, it all varies as sometimes the art devolves significantly past the point of saying its the anime's art style and just leaves me wondering \"why?\" But of all the negatives, this one is probably the most ignorable. \\n\\n\r\nAs for strengths, the biggest one is that its very character driven and knows how to make us care for characters in such a short amount of time, but it comes at the cost of the above negatives and due to the nature of the anime, the characters would not live long enough anyway to solidify a deep connection to. More episodes would have been amazing for this show, but we have to consume what we have been served. I can also say with certainty that not one of the problems I listed was enough to affect my overall positive enjoyment of the show, and my lower overall rating of 6 is  mostly due to objective critique. I'm a firm believer of watching a show for the enjoyment rather that to look to criticize it, so if the synopsis interests you at all, I still recommend you give it a try. Just bear in mind the above qualms and perhaps lower expectations accordingly.\\n\\n\r\nIn all, Juuni Taisen presents a simple yet effective story with compelling characters, though both of these are mired down by easy predictability and a lack of focus on action where there should be more of it. There was a lot of missed potential here, but at the same time it hit just enough right marks to distinguish itself as something truly unique in its field.",

From the start it's just 12 people, essentially and aesthetically bound by simbolysm ties which alone should haw rang a bell for anyone with more exposure to books rather than mainstream media.\r\nLooking at how the story is build around 12 episodes, there is almost no room for more world building or entertainment candy by prolonged character study and stretched EPIC fight visuals. It's bound to realism even with the fanatasy elements in it.  I couldeven call it cruel; how all aspects of life are finite in the end - if you are to strong, fights are one sided and quick, deception and technology can fight on equal grounds against the strong, but no matter how strong anybody gets, no one can be a one man army in the end. Thus, the value of the warrior lies in his led life of fighting, not in a single moments comfrontation with reality.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the stories achilles heel lies in the constrains of simbolysm it chose to delve into. You just can't igonore the hint's so blatantly put in your face and make assumtions on face value alone.

            "content": "Disclaimer: This review might contain spoilers on the anime \"Juuni Taisen\". Please excuse me if I make a mistake or you don't understand a part, as English is not my first language. Thank you.\r\nJuuni Taisen or How to Scam the Audience\r\nAs a fan of NisiOisiN it is uncomfortable to write this review. I still can not believe that Juuni Taisen, an anime based on his novel, could be so mediocre.\r\nAnd the worst thing is that at the beginning it looked promising. Everything seemed to point to this anime would be avant-garde to break with the clich\u00e9s of the formula \"Battle Royale\"; however, episode after episode,Juuni Taisen was transformed into a mess unable to maintain interest.\\n\r\n\u00a0\\n\r\nSome characters so one-dimensional that, with some exceptions, it was impossible to connect with them; and a plot that folded to a totally predictable formula, killed any kind of suspense or mystery possible. In case anyone did not notice, the order of the deaths was the inverse of the order of the Chinese zodiac; and if that was very difficult to guess, the ending showed the sequence in all the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, what was initially innovative and unexpected, soon became a heavy and insipid structure. I mean the formula of showing a character's background right before he died. I have to admit, that even in the final episode itself I expected a plot twist that would justify everything, but no, that salvation never came.\\n\\n\r\nIt is supposed that the subject of this type of series is that each death is unexpected and that it is never known who will win until the end; nevertheless, Juuni Taisen decided to remove that suspense from the middle to focus on making a veiled criticism of the war?\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with that is that without suspense it is difficult to maintain interest. Not to mention that the characters have hardly any development and it is extremely difficult to empathize with them; not only because of its poor construction, but because just at the moment they develop a little they end up dying.\\n\\n\r\nAnd in the midst of that scenario, do you want to teach us that war is bad? Using cheap self-help book philosophy? With this panorama it was inevitable that this series would fail. A pity that a work of a great like NisiOisiN ends up happening without pain or glory.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, as in everything, there are exceptions, for example the Ox and the Tigress were two of the rescue characters; unfortunately they did not have more minutes on the screen. The rat could be another prominent character, especially for those last two episodes; however, his absence during more than 75% of the series made him lose all the weight he could potentially have.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the resolution was totally anticlimactic, which did not help at all to improve the series. Only the issue of desire in the final episode was a bit like raising the quality a little; however, in the end even that was handled horribly.\\n\\n\r\nFor that desire to forget everything had had an impact, it was necessary that the rat had more weight during the 12 episodes; If the audience had suffered their pain while living each path, for example, they would have had more connection with the boy and his predicament.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical section. The soundtrack only has the opening to highlight, but it is not to launch rockets; the rest of the music is totally forgettable. The animation started well, but soon it went to the floor, leaving a lot to be desired in the process.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the direction was frightening in every minute. There were hardly two or three sequences to remember and it was not because they had been first level, but because everything else gave pity. Character design is the only thing to be highlighted within the technical section; Here I must say that a very good job was done.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, a series that disappointed with a mediocre execution of a premise with enormous potential. If you have not seen it, do not even come near it. See you in the next review.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nA series with a huge potential that went to hell for a mediocre execution.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal rating\\n\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "I have observed some mixed opinions about Juuni Taisen (Zodiac War) during its airtime. Like that the plot is weak, it\u00b4s predictable, the fights are boring, the deaths are stupid, and the characters are scumbags with no development. And from the other side that it\u00b4s actually quite good, even great. That the characters are fairly interesting, with as much focus on their past, (with some interesting stories) as the actually death game. In my review I will give you my point of view on this, and how I perceived the whole show. \r\nI wouldn\u00b4t call the plot weak, just narrow. The premises are a deathbattle in 24 hours, based on the Twelve Zodiacs Hours. According to Chinese astrology, though not popularly used, a person\u2019s personality and life is more decided by his/her birth hour than year. So instead for each animal sign belonging to a specific sequence of years, it depends on which hour of the day you were born. Which is the case with the narrative of Juuni Tasien. Which explains the otherwise kind of weird age span of the characters, and how that is that dragon and snake can be twins. Knowing that is not a spoiler, whatever you google on it or not can be doe. In my point of view, Juuni Taisen delivered what it promised. You get to know why these battles are hold (whatever you find it interesting or believable is up to you), what the participants and organizers gain from it, and the battle setup. So, to me the plot isn\u00b4t weak, just very straight forward and narrow. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is predictable to some extent, but just as much it isn\u00b4t (don\u00b4t get fooled by the first 3-episode pattern). Yes, there are a major spoiler for who is going to die next included in the show, but not how and when they die. If you can live with that, this won\u00b4t be a problem for you. \\n\\n\r\nSince many probably signed up for Juuni Taisen due to the action tag, there is somethings that can be good to know in advance. The fights are short, intense, consume little airtime, and not your typically anime type of fights. You know, the type that can last a half of an episode, with the participants taking an immense amount of punishment, just for them to rise up again and keep fighting because of their \u201cstrong determination and will\u201d. You aren\u2019t going to find any of this in Juuni Taisen. The fights, battles and strategies in Juuni Taisen are a bit more \u201crealistic\u201d. Read me right, nothing about JT is quite realistic, but in the manor of how they play out. \\n\\n\r\nLet me clarify by Mike Tyson\u00b4s famous quote; \u201cEveryone has a plan until they get punched in the face\u201d. Which much align with how it works in Juuni Taisen. The characters are scheming, plotting, and planning, but as in real life, things seldom unfolds according to plan. There are factors that you forget to take in count, the misreading of a situation or opponent, the overestimation of your own abilities, or the underestimation of the opponent\u00b4s. The fights themselves is in my opinion often pretty interesting and nicely executed, I enjoyed them a lot, much due to what I mentioned above. You could clearly make out what of the things I mentioned above, went wrong when a character lost.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads me to the deaths. One might call some of them stupid, but I would call them human. The characters are often finding themselves in a situation where they get surprised, overwhelmed or hesitate a second to long, and end up dead because of it. If that isn\u00b4t typically human traits, I don\u00b4t know what is. Even the strongest, bravest, most experienced man can crack under too much mental pressure, which JT displays well. And the participants are for sure under much mental pressure, they are after all in a time limited death battle with only one winner outcome. If that doesn\u00b4t for fill your desire for \u201ccool\u201d deaths, well you may want to watch something else. \\n\r\nAs for the characters being scumbags, is absolutely partly true. A number of characters are really some of the worst scum the human race can offer, and some are far from it. With that said, I didn\u00b4t find any of the characters boring, quite the opposite. I found the depraved characters just as interesting as the rest. It\u00b4s a question of balance, and there did JT also delivered, its got the whole span of personalities. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the character development, let me first ask you a question. How much do you develop as a person during 24 hours? I myself, can say, that I probably doesn\u00b4t develop significantly much during that span of time. So, don\u00b4t expect any revolutionary character developments, this is the type of show that focuses more on how characters will act after their current state in life. \\n\\n\r\nWhich leads me to how the characters are handle together with the story. The plot can thoroughly be divided into two sets. Set one being the battle occurring in present time, and set two being the backgrounds of the characters, with set one and two mixing together from the start to the end. I liked the concept, which gave information about certain characters along the way, and at the same time pieced together their current place in the battle, or filled out the narrow plot with some good context. That made them feel more like persons then just war-robots. Tiger\u00b4s story was especially touching, and when put in with her role in the battle, it actually accounts as development for me. There\u00b4s a fair amount of time spent on dialogues and inner monologues, which let\u00b4s you get to know the characters and how they think. For the little time 12 characters have in just 12-episodes, I think most of them where quite fleshed out.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song \"Rupture\" by Panorama Panama Town, is in my opinion the best OP this season. The song and visuals are capturing the atmosphere of JT really well, and set me in the perfect mode for an episode. The ending song \"Keshin no Kemono\" by Do As Infinity, is equally as good, which round up that episode by showcasing the civil side of the warriors. The VA\u00b4s are well matched with their characters, and all preform their role to satisfaction. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the art and animation holds a high quality. Nice coloured and detailed backgrounds, fluent and intense action scenes, cool character designs, and fitting light settings. There are some parts where the quality drops (running out of budget?), but those scenes are pretty rare. \\n\\n\r\nSo, conclusion time. Juuni Tasien surprised me, and drew me in much more then I had expected. I enjoyed every episode, predictable or not. Some of the backstories were more touching than what one might expect for this type of show, and somewhat humanized the warriors a bit. I recommend this show to everyone who can live with the conditions I mentioned in this review, and won\u00b4t expect something similar to the Fate-series. The plot base is the same, but everything else has a completely different vibe. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoy your watch!  \\n",

            "content": "I never thought I would write a review, but here I am. I am writing this because too few people seem to get what this series is about.\r\nFirst of all, I have to say that if you only like action-comedy shounens, this is not a series for you. If you want just a lot of fight scenes and plot twists, watch something else.\r\nNow, let me explain why I liked Juuni Taisen.\r\nCharacters:\r\nWell, all the characters die in the expected order, and there aren't any major plot twists. In each episode, we get some backstory, a bit of fighting (I will talk about that later) and usuallya death. However, I can say that the backstories are well written. Not even one of them tries to be too tragic, and the characters vary from pacifists to thieves and psychopaths. However, most of them contain some tragedy, and some of them really touched my heart. I even cried one, which I really didn't expect to happen when I was watching this series.\\n\\n\r\nAction:\\n\r\nThe action isn't really a focal part of this show, but the animation is really well done. However, I was more impressed by a thing you don't really see anywhere else. In general, there are two types of fights: the classic direct power clash and the more indirect fights in which the opponents try to analyze the opponent's unique power ( the activation conditions, limits and weaknesses) and try to find a smart way to win. Juuni Taisen looks at first like it belongs to the second class, but it has a surprising element of realism added to the battles: almost all of the plans DON'T work. And they end up failing for some really simple reasons that the characters just overlooked. \\n\r\nFor some, it may sound anti-climactic, but I thought it was awesome how this anime showed just how quickly a life can end in battle.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack:\\n\r\nWell, I don't really know much about music, but I enjoyed the op, and the rest of the music was pretty good. Not one of the best, but good.\\n\\n\r\nNegative points:\\n\r\nI liked this anime from the beginning and around episode 10 I was thinking I might just give it a 10/11 (11 being the masterpieces). However, the last episode was just unsatisfying. Most of the people who are reading this are probably going to ignore my advice, but I am going to say it anyway: DON'T watch the last episode. Just pretend ep 11 is the conclusion. That is going to be much better. Or, at least, stop at the half point and imagine yourself what the winner asked for. I am going to say this again: DON'T watch the last episode till the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime a personal 9/11 and a recommendation to watch it only if you think you will enjoy it in the way that I described it.\\n\r\nYou can watch it legally for free on Crunchyroll.",

            "content": "If you were given one wish to have anything you want, what would you choose?\r\nThis is the question our 12 combatants have over their heads as they try to survive in this battle royale anime where only one can survive. It is the formula that been used in many battle royale anime and so it also applies here. Who will win? Who will lose? But, most importantly, who will get the longest backstory? \r\nSo sit back, relax and \"Everybody, clap your hands!\" as I present to you the anime review for Juuni Taisen. Lets begin: \r\nStory: 6/10 \r\nSo like I said, the anime is aboutthe Juuni Taisen. A battle royale where 12 combatants compete to kill off each other in order to win the prize of having one wish of their desires; that's about it. Honestly you don't need to have a complex story for a premise that is this simple. You are given the premise and then you move on to see what happens next. It is the kind of story that develops depending on the actions of the characters and what they do to survive. \\n\\n\r\nNow one of the things that Juuni Taisen does that I like is that there is no true protagonist. Almost every character gets the light shine on them for an episode or two and we get to see how they plan to win the Juuni Taisen what actions they are planning to make. We also get to see what actions they took before they entered the Juuni Taisen to get an idea of kind of character they are in backsotries. The problem is that they can be inconsistent in terms of actually being interesting and length. While some are enjoyable to watch, some of them can be kind of boring. It doesn't help that sometimes that the backstories can take an entire episode to just tell us the lives of these characters and their morals. This doesn't help when you get these long backstories and then they get killed off quickly, leaving the viewer disappointment due to it feeling anticlimactic. This is mainly due to the mistakes that the characters make but more on that later. \\n\\n\r\nJuuni Taisen also likes to portray the battle royale as a literal war. The city that the anime is based in is a battlefield with soldiers in it; fighting each other in order to survive. Not to win, but to survive. Because by the end of the anime you get the message that there are no winners in war, only survivors. That is exactly what Juuni Taisen is trying to portray. It's not trying to be Fate or Future Diary, it is trying to be Juuni Taisen. But the message can be difficult to understand because the characters aren't really grounded in reality when they can do supernatural things that no normal human could, making it difficult to see that message. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nOne of the best things Juuni Taisen gets right is that it understands that a battle royale anime needs to have a diverse set of characters and thankfully it does. Juuni Taisen has a large variety in characters all representing an animal in the Chinese Zodiac Line. From the weird dressing but psychotic nature of Rabbit to the calm and collective nature of Ox to the carefree but kindhearted Tiger. These characters are interesting to watch and makes for good entertainment when their personalities clash together.....most of the time. Some characters can be one dimensional and uninteresting to watch, making their expected deaths less shocking. I'm not going to say who due to spoilers but they can be uninteresting. \\n\\n\r\nNow like I said earlier, their deaths are mainly caused by their mistakes because in war, you can't make mistakes otherwise you are dead. You make a mistake, you die, simple as that. This is something people tend to gloss over without thinking because it is an important factor. They can die because they were overconfident or they can die because they let their guard down. A couple of mistakes do happen multiple times but mainly they die because of the mistake they specifically made. However I do believe that the characters can still make these mistakes and still put on some good fights. There was only a couple of fights in the anime that were noteworthy as the rest ended very quickly. I think that it is a waste considering what these characters can do. These characters can control birds, levitate for no reason, see into different world lines (get it?) and resurrect the dead. It just feels wasteful and I believe that if the anime is not going to be really using all these abilities to the fullest, then they should have more grounded characters. It would certainly make its message about war more easy to understand. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 6.5/10 \\n\\n\r\nNow the overall animation can be rather inconsistent. But I must give credit where credit is due though, the fight scenes that are in the anime are well animated, especially in the earlier episodes. There is a lot of smooth action in them, especially since some of them are noticeably animated in 3D, making them an enjoyment to watch. The 3D animation doesn't hinder it and won't bother many people since its mainly animated in the standard 2D animation anyway. \\n\\n\r\nHowever the character designs, while being unique to represent their animal in the Chinese Zodiac line, are rather poorly animated. Most of the time they look like they've been poorly drawn as there are notable black lines in their designs, making them lack detail and look sloppy. This happens a lot in this anime and you will notice it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack most of the time didn't really stand out besides a couple of tracks at specific times. Most of the time it plays to itself to match the atmosphere and tone at that moment.  However I do want to give credit the OP and ED of this show. The opening, \"Rupture\" Panorama Panama Town is quite possibly one of my favourite OP this year. It has a nice calm rhythm and beat that you don't normally here in an anime opening. It matches the anime well as it is not really explosive and is trying to be different than other openings. However, its ending song, \"Keshin no Kemono\" by Do As Infinity, is the complete opposite. Its fast and loud which, again, is the complete opposite of what many other anime ED songs matches the anime well because because like the anime, it is trying to be different. \\n\\n\r\nI also want to give very quick praise to the dub as I do believe the voice actors do good jobs of capturing the characters personalities well. I specifically like Jerry Jewell as Usagi/Rabbit. While the Japanese voice actor makes Rabbit sound creepy, He makes Rabbit sound quirky and sometimes humorous which I like. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.8/10 Recommendation: \"Consider it\" \\n\\n\r\nLike I said, this show isn't trying to be Fate or Future Diary, it's trying to be Juuni Taisen. It wants to be its own thing and I respect it for it. This show is trying to portray the message that \"War is hell\" in the wise words of Jim Carry and it wants people to understand that. If you are looking for a show like Fate then you won't find it here but if you looking for something different in a battle royale anime then it is worth checking out. It is only 12 episodes long so it won't take you too long to watch.",

            "content": "Juuni Taisen is a very unique breed of anime. It's left me with more mixed feelings than most shows I can honestly think of. Some of it's good, some of it's bad and what we're left with is a very strange package to unwrap right before Christmas. Well, let me try and tackle this with some structure. \r\nThe three key things that define Juuni Taisen as a show are it's characters, it's thematic storytelling and it's anti climaxes. And all of them have their ups and downs.\r\nSo i'll start with characters. It's hard not to be immediately drawn in because all the characters have prettystellar designs, both visually and how they're written. None of the 12 participants feel interchangeable and clear work has gone into making them interesting and fun to watch. A lot of the good stuff in Juuni Taisen is just watching these characters interact and deal with one another across the show's runtime. We're given a decent amount of time to learn about most of their backstories, their motives and their goals and they work well with their actions.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately the strength of these characters is cut short as, since this is a death game, the characters tend to die off very quickly before they can have any actual development in the show. Once you know a character's backstory, for the most part, it's just a countdown to when they'll die, so sometimes it can be hard to get attached to them, especially early characters. There are some exceptions to this, for instance Tiger is easily one of the more standout characters and Rat also have some development, but they're drops in a bucket. \\n\\n\r\nOnto the plot, the strength of it is definitely in the themes of the show. Every character having clearly defined goals and methods means their actions and even deaths are particularly fitting. It's nice as well that it's not drawn a huge amount of attention to and there to expand on for the more eagle eyed viewer who spies a cue in a certain backstory or in dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the plot itself is very bare bones and basic. It's your standard killing game affair with a rich group betting on it and somehow being able to grant wishes, none of which is given any detail. And on top of that, the plot does get predictable quickly, thanks to the show being based on the story of the Chinese Zodiac, if you're even vaguely aware of the story, you already know who the winner is and who will die in what order, which for a killing game is kind of detrimental. \\n\\n\r\nWhat will surprise about Juuni Taisen is its use of anticlimaxes, something not often seen in anime. These tend to be both good and bad, sometimes they will earnestly catch you off guard for how sudden an action is or how shocking an event was and other times you'll feel somewhat robbed of a potentially interesting payoff.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation itself can be pretty good when the show actually decides to use it, certain fight scenes later in the show are pretty good but unfortunately a lot of the actual 'animation' is just used on simple talking scenes and it's something of a shame because when fight scenes are present, they tend to be pretty good and make you want more. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, while I personally got some enjoyment out of Juuni Taisen, this is definitely not a show for everyone. I'd say give it the three episode rule and if you're enjoying the characters and can get over the predictable nature of the plot, it's a fun but bumpy ride right until the end. If you're just here for action and violent scenes, you'll get some of it, but probably not as much as you're craving. \\n\\n\r\nI'm glad I watched Juuni Taisen, but it's only getting a polite round of applause from me.",

So what exactly is Juuni Taisen? I'll try not to write any Spoilers on this review, but you are warned.\r\nThe story of this anime goes around 12 War Assassins that are gathered to participate on a \"Battle Royale\" fest, the last man standing will have the power to have a wish. But Juuni Taisen is not exactly what you think it might be, take itthis way: Juuni Taisen is NOT an action anime, at first I thought that Juuni Taisen would succeed if the fights were good despise not having story at all, sadly the fights were just a predictable slaughter fest to get rid of characters in order to have a winner. The true purpose of this anime, the one I found, were found in the very end, the wish. If you are the winner of the Juuni Taisen you get a wish, but what wish will you choose? Wealth?, Safety? World's Peace? \"Not even 100 wishes could end a man's ambition\" is an interesting quote I found at the end of this anime. Story: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation were smooth in the first episode, but each week the animation went downhill to the point of having CGi Models for the last fights, and it didn't just look bad, but pretty out of place after that amazing first episode and the animation that were set on it. Still some fights are quite good enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. Art: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP sequence is quite catchy, there were some interesting fighting generic soundtrack included on this Anime as well as the sound effects, nothing really impressive, but it is quite enough. Sound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime consist on the formula of setting death flags each time a character's back ground story is told, so there isn't a significant development to almost any character on this anime, except for the winner. Gladly I liked how it won and how much it struggled to get its wish. This end up being an interesting way to fill the lack of character development that this anime generated, it was interesting enough to redeem (Just a bit) this anime. Characters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI won't lie, I did like this anime, even if it were predictable, it was enjoyable enough, specially towards the end. Sadly it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It could have been better, specially if it didn't have such stupid and pathetic way to kill off characters after showing up their background stories. At the end I discovered the true purpose of this anime, which wasn't a Battle Royale, but the wish, which was meant for the viewer to think about it, to elaborate what it is to have a wish to fulfill. What will it be? will it be enough? Is it right? That's up to you. Enjoyment 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5,6 (6)/10: So Juuni Taisen isn't entirely a bad Anime, but it isn't that great either, it has its highs and its lows, This anime could have been a masterpiece if it were polished on a different way rather than being predictable.",

Knowing the order of the deaths in a battle royale will definitely ruin the experience.\r\nYou don't have to worry about this in the first episode, since it's the opening that plays in the end. But the problem is the second episode. I'm glad I noticed it just in time to save my experience, whenthe character that died in the first episode appeared first, and the next character that appeared was the one who died in the second episode, I could see what was coming, so I closed the video and just kept watching all the episodes without watching the endings, except in the last episode, when I finally watched it. This is probably not the way the producers meant it to be watched, but I don't care. It was a horrible decision they made, and the way I explained is definitely the best way to enjoy it. \\n\r\nLooking at the score I can clearly see that most people fell in the ending trap, so I really hope that more people will do like I did so they can see how amazing this battle royale anime is.\\n\r\nI really loved Juuni Taisen, and it just became one of my favorites. The opening, the OST, and the characters were really good, especially Ushii, and I'm seriously planning to use his philosophy from now on.",

The show itself is first and foremost an action anime. The story is not complex or hard to follow so don\u2019t expect any deep meaning from the plot.

After completing the show I beleive that too many people viewed this anime in the wrong light. \r\nFirst, I would point out that if you are simply looking for a show to take the place of the Fate series then you will be disappointed. Juuni Taisen is very different from its battle royale counterparts, but I would argue it is better than most others, aside from Fate Zero. \r\nNext I would address the most common complaint, being that the plot was too predictable. I would agree that at times theepisodes fell into a pattern but the purpose of the show is not necessarily to surprise viewers at every turn. This is not a mindless action show designed to simply excite and surprise. \\n\\n\r\nJuuni Taisen is a look at the people who are fighting in the death game and a story about who they are, why they are fighting, and what they want in the end. it is character driven in nature, and excels at attaching you to multiple characters as you learn about what makes them, and they will make of the battle. It is far from flawless with a few of the characters falling flatter than others but for what it is, I enjoyed it more and more with each episode.",

A deathmatch is nothing new, but its the ambiance of Junni Taisen that's different. Firstly, the story is told without a main character. The attention latches you in with a mystery aspect concerning many of the characters, but these are held out just as long as they need to be.The characters have pretty unique designs too, but don't expect anything too deep. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike many shows, Junni Taisen actually ends and everything is answers, which is rare.

            "content": "So, Juuni Taisen, eh? It was on my watch-list while I was watching the Summer anime of 2017, and now that I have watched it, what do I think of it? To be straightforward about it, this anime was probably my greatest disappointment in 2017. I\u2019m usually not surprised if an anime is really bad, since I usually read the reviews and check its rating before I watch it. I did the same this time, but somewhere deep inside my heart, I was hoping that there might be at least one decent element to this anime. Perhaps the action scenes, perhaps the opening song, orperhaps a certain character that stands out? That wasn\u2019t the case at all. I was let down by every aspect of Juuni Taisen.\\n\\n\r\nI took an interest in Juuni Taisen because of its creator, Nisio Isin. He was also the author of the much acclaimed Monogatari series. The Monogatari series follows an excellent narrative and is able to indulge it\u2019s viewers in the story, while Juuni Taisen focuses more on its characters. The plot of Juuni Taisen is pretty simple- it\u2019s a battle royal among 12 warriors who have individual fighting styles that define them, and are each designated as one of the zodiac signs from the Chinese zodiac. Sounds familiar? Yes, the it\u2019s similar to the Fate Series.  But, that doesn\u2019t matter as there are several anime with a battle royal theme. No complications until this part, but the problem starts from the first episode. It\u2019s simply too predictable, unlike what a battle royal should be. The story is not compelling enough to persuade you keep watching, but even in case you decide to watch the rest, you\u2019ll realize that it\u2019s predictable for the entire 12 episodes. The plot had a lot of potential but it was poorly executed.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like blood, gore and psychotic bloodthirsty characters hunting down people all over a city, then maybe this anime is for you. For me though, it just didn\u2019t work. Since I am talking about the predictability of this anime, let me just give you an example of how predictable it is- they pretty much show the order in which the cast dies in the opening video itself. I am a fan of anime openings with subtle clues about the story and plot, and one anime that does this beautifully would be Your Lie In April, but Juuni Taisen is just stupid. I mean there\u2019s a thing called subtlety! You just don\u2019t go ahead and put the order in which the characters die on the opening song! Get it together, guys.\\n\\n\r\nAs I have mentioned before, the show focuses on its characters, and despite that I could not find myself attached to the characters at all. Every character is provided with a backstory, and whenever the recounting of a particular character\u2019s backstory begins, it means the said character is going to meet an untimely death sooner or later. The only character I felt myself feeling sorry for was Tora (Tiger), and even that was just a marginal emotion. The characters die in the most ridiculous ways. After all the talk of how skilled and experienced they are, they do the stupidest mistakes and poof, they\u2019re gone. The worst character would be Usagi (Rabbit), since he is not even given a backstory like the others. The character of Usagi is just a sorry excuse for a psychotic, bloodthirsty killer they needed for the advancement of the story. For an anime that relies on its characters to make up the story, Juuni Taisen does a poor job at character development.\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say about the animation? Animated by studio Graphinica, the animation is awful too. The animators are so lazy that none of the battle sequences have been properly animated and this is supposed to be a battle royal. The trifling number of sword exchanges that have been animated are just a bunch of stills that are put together. As for the sound- wait there were sound effects? What? If there were, they were so appalling that I did not even notice them. Both the opening and ending songs fail to make an impact. I felt that they were just monotonous and boring.\\n\\n\r\nSo, would I recommend watching Juuni Taisen? Well if you\u2019re someone who likes to watch unoriginal, thoughtless action that shows blood and gore and wouldn\u2019t mind the predictability, then go ahead. I was greatly disappointed by this anime, and I hope I never come across something like this again. It\u2019s just a waste of time for me and any person who likes to watch decent content. Sure, it had great potential, but potential in theory doesn\u2019t matter if the creators have already failed to exploit that potential and made a sorry excuse for an anime.",

            "content": "Please note this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching Juni Taisen and while care has been taken to ensure that there are no spoilers within story analysis there may still be spoilers in character analysis. You have been warned. \r\nWhen 12 fierce and powerful warriors that have the names of one of the 12 Chinese constellations are chosen to fight in a contest where the prize is one wish the only result is a fierce struggle to obtain it. \r\nJuni Taisen based on a popular light novel of the same name is an action anime that makes use ofan interesting premise that when combined with the genre and theme makes it a potent combination. The traditional contest between fighters and struggles that ensures between them is reinforced by the interesting medium that it uses which is a contest between 12 houses all of which have different ideologies and the attitudes of each of the chosen fighters that take part in it. The first episode made a pretty good impression on me because it addressed one of the main problems that such anime\u2019s have which it\u2019s lack of a good origin story for its fighters which when combined with the actions of the characters adds much more depth to them.  \\n\\n\r\nTaking place in modern day Japan Juni Taisen focuses on the Juni Taisen a fierce competition that takes place every 12 years and pits the representatives of each of the 12 Zodiac families against each other in a large-scale battle royal that replaces conventional war between nations on the global stage. In a battle that is fierce beyond measure 12 of the best fighters from their houses would fight with everything that they have in battles that are just as contests of strength as it is of strategy and maneuvering. The prize of this battle is the ability to grant one wish and one wish only. While the overall story of the anime is the battle royal itself the series also takes great care in explaining the backstory and origins of each of the main characters a move that I thought was well done as it allowed us the viewers to understand the motivations and desires of each of them and from there invest in the ones that we like. \\n\\n\r\nDokatsu \\n\\n\r\nDokatsu voiced by veteran voice actor Tomohiro Nishimura is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the fighters that were chosen to take part in this years Juni Taisen representing his house in this large-scale battle royal. A member of the House of Dogs of the 12 Zodiac families Dokatsu is an intelligent, calm and cautious person that believes in the simple belief that they should use every weapon and tactic at their disposal to eliminate their enemies and secure victory.  As a result of this Dokatsu is someone that loves to break the rules and fight his way. While intelligent and fast thinking and possessing of good deduction skills Dokatsu was noted to have a certain element of arrogance about him in that he views his fellow competitors and their respective houses with disdain and venom best shown in his assessment of the other fighters when he was still in the game. His death by his miscalculation that was caused by his arrogance was somewhat ironic as a result.  \\n\\n\r\nHitsujii \\n\\n\r\nHitsujii voiced by veteran voice actor Cho is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the fighters that were chosen to fight in this years Juni Taisen. A member of the Zodiac\u2019s House of the Ram Hitsujii is a cautious, quiet, patient person that matches well with the traditional attributes that a ram would have. Unlike the rest of the competitors that were chosen to take part in this contest Hitsujii is by far the oldest fighter that was chosen and as a result, is often referred to as the old man of the 12 a term that I thought was appropriate to him as a sign of respect. A veteran fighter Hitsujii can easily be defined as someone that is cautious and cunning in equal nature that when combined with his patience truly makes him a fierce warrior to contend with. While not one that prefers to strike using nefarious tactics like necromancy Hitsujii is no less lethal with his method of using powerful explosives to destroy his opponents with. Hitsujii\u2019s ability to stay both undetected by the rest and his ability to stay one step ahead of any hunters was a great proof of his abilities.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile Hitsujii is noted to be an intelligent and patient person it's interesting to note that he also has the semblance of pride as well which often clouds his judgement on things. However, what I really admired about the character of Hitsujii is his backstory that was used to show his motivations for joining the fight and the backstory of what actually made him the man that he was. His reason for joining the fight I felt was also pretty heartwarming as well as his thoughts towards his family. \\n\\n\r\nInounoshishi \\n\\n\r\nInounoshishi voiced by veteran seiyuu Yoko Hikasa of High School DxD and Rokka no Yuusha fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the fighters that were chosen to fight in this year\u2019s competition. A member of the House of Boars of the Zodiac families Inounoshishi is an intelligent, fast thinking and cautious person by nature that is reinforced by a fierce tenacity and cunning that matches well with what a boar\u2019s personality will be like. On the surface, Inounoshishi is a capable fighter that seems to be cordial to others and able to think beyond of simple victories and defeats that characterize the Juni Taisen but beneath that, however, it\u2019s another story altogether. While cordial on the surface Inounoshishi is shown to be a cruel and manipulative person that\u2019s also rather cold-hearted and willing to do all that she can to secure victory and fame for herself. Perhaps as a result of this, she also displayed a certain level of arrogance at the other Zodiac houses seeing them as obstacles to her aims.  The backstory for this character I felt did an interesting job of showing the struggles that she went through as she trained to become a fighter and her gradual evolution into cruel, manipulative and intelligent person from the quiet and reluctant girl that she was then. Though by far one of the shortest-lived fighters I felt that her backstory combined with her development from that actually made her a pretty interesting character.  \\n\\n\r\nNezumi  \\n\\n\r\nNezumi voiced by veteran voice actor Shun Horie is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the fighters that were chosen to take part in this years Juni Taisen. A member of the House of Rats of the Zodiac families Nezumi is a quiet, calm and composed person that seems to prefer solitude than working together with others. Despite that Nezumi is also shown to be intelligent and cautious in his moves willing to work together with others if their goals and ideologies remain similar to each other. While respectful and cordial towards others it can be seen that Nezumi is someone that trusts slowly and is wary of others particularly if they approached suddenly. While seemingly quiet Nezumi surprisingly can be rather talkative and perceptive at times and his analysis of the fight and its purpose was an interesting one. A prominent trait of Nezumi is his perception and his ability to understand the mood and the feelings that people near him is feeling which is a direct result of his powers. This ability I felt was an interesting one as it not only gives him an edge in combat but also able to tell if someone is trying to lie to you as well. The core ability of Nezumi, however, was by far the most interesting one but one that I felt was revealed rather late in the series. The character of Nezumi is by far the most mysterious of the fighters that took part in this years Juni Taisen. \\n\\n\r\nNiwatori  \\n\\n\r\nNiwatori voiced by veteran seiyuu Ayane Sakura of Charlotte and Dragonar Academy fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the fighters that were chosen to take part in this year\u2019s contest. A member of the Zodiac\u2019s House of Roosters Niwatori on the surface is a shy, quiet and kind young woman that seems out of place on the battlefields in which the Juni Taisen is taking place. Beneath the surface however, it can be seen that the surface personality of a meek young and innocent maiden only serves as a mask for Niwatori and its what lies beneath to this that is actually her true personality. Niwatori\u2019s true personality contrasts greatly with the young innocent maiden look that she wore when around other fighters being someone that was deceptive and adept at using her looks and behavior to secure an advantage over her opponents. This last point is helped greatly by her battle outfit which is rather revealing for someone that fights on the field. While Niwatori retains the positive and cheerful attitude that she used on her mask here it can be seen that she\u2019s not loyal to anyone but herself and see\u2019s others as mere stepping stones in her game of finding fame.  The character of Niwatori I felt was an interesting one that was one of the more developed characters of the series as her personalities contrasted greatly with each other. I felt that her seiyuu Ayane Sakura really did a great job voicing her. \\n\\n\r\nShuryuu\\n\\n\r\nShuryuu voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami of Yamada and the Seven witches and Owari no seraph fame is one of the main characters of the series and one of the fighters that were chosen to take part in this years Juni Taisen. A member of the Zodiac\u2019s house of the monkey Shuryuu is an enigma within the Zodiac families chosen for this contest as unlike the rest of the fighters Shuryuu is a pacifist by nature and works to end conflict and wars across countries rather than start and participate in them as the other houses do something that has earned her no small amount of disdain from the others. A kind, caring and honest person by nature Shuryuu is someone that having seen the worst excesses caused by humanity\u2019s endless lust for war and conflict works tirelessly to promote peace and cooperation between countries which is an admirable concept. Despite knowing that the other Zodiac houses dislike her immensely Shuryuu is someone that cares deeply about ending the threat of conflict in the human world and even when faced by hostility will still try her utmost to help others which is best shown in her attempt to create an alliance between the 12 members at the start of the contest. Though mindful that she\u2019s going to be a target of the other houses due to her actions it can be seen that Shuryuu is someone that\u2019s also intelligent and inquisitive able to deduce someone\u2019s beliefs and intents by interacting with them a fact that\u2019s helped greatly by her ability to sense people\u2019s intents and being sensitive to people\u2019s feelings.  As can be expected of someone that has the attributes of one Shuryuu was noted to be a capable planner that believes in having backup plans something that I felt was really necessary for this contest. The character of Shuryuu I felt was a well-designed one as she had a personality and ideology that contrasted greatly with the other fighters and the determination to help the other fighters despite the fact that they are all trying to kill her was admirable. Saori Hayami I felt did a fantastic job of portraying the character of Shuryuu.\\n\\n\r\nTora \\n\\n\r\nTora voiced by veteran seiyuu Hiromi Igarashi of Brave Witches and High School Fleet fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the fighters that were chosen to take part in this year\u2019s contest. A member of the Zodiac\u2019s House of the Tiger Tora is someone that best be described as being carefree, relaxed and joyful and indeed has a very joking personality when met for the first time. Despite seemingly not taking the fight seriously Tora can become surprisingly ferocious and competitive when provoked into becoming serious and in this, we can see just how powerful her real combat skills actually are. The fact that Tora also took care to create a rather revealing outfit and act like a drunken idiot in combat in an effort to lure enemies within range of her claws I felt was an indication of her cunning as a warrior of the Tiger. The Character of Tora I felt was an interesting one, but I felt that it was her backstory and origin story that combined with her future self-was the thing that made her so as it allowed us to see the kind of person that she was like in the past and see how far she had come from her past self.  Her connection with Ox and how that allowed her to find her own path in particular I felt was especially well done. \\n\\n\r\nUsagi \\n\\n\r\nUsagi voiced by veteran voice actor Nobuhiko Okamoto of Three Gatsu no Lion and Alderamin of the sky fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the fighters that were chosen to take part in this year\u2019s contest. A member of the Zodiac\u2019s House of Rabbits Usagi is a quiet, composed and calm person on the surface and indeed, in the beginning, his nature was such that I thought he will be peaceful like Shuryuu was. However, beneath this mask, it can be seen that Usagi is someone that is intelligent, creative and really cunning and well versed at using deception to gain an advantage over his enemies. Although all of the fighters that have been chosen to take part in this years Juni Taisen can be said to be notable in their respective strengths and personalities it can be said that Usagi\u2019s is by far the most interesting and revolting of them all. The most notable trait of Usagi is without a doubt his rather warped sense of what friends are in that he seems to see friends just as he see\u2019s other fighters which are that of mere pieces of a game that is the Juni Taisen that is to be used as shields and swords to beat his opponents with the least effort. While Usagi\u2019s warped sense of what friends are was no doubt one of his prominent traits the other one is no doubt the ability that defines him as a member of the House of Rabbits which when combined with his creative use of tactics really made him a formidable foe on the battlefield for the others. \\n\\n\r\nUshii \\n\\n\r\nUshii voiced by veteran voice actor Yuuichirou Umehara of Amanchu and Girlish Number fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the fighters that were selected to take part in this year\u2019s contest. A member of the Zodiac\u2019s family House of the Ox Ushii even before the contest began was already well known to the world as a formidable warrior that had the ominous nickname of the Genius of slaughter. On the surface, Ushii is a calm, composed and quiet person that thanks to his vast experience at war is also wise and adept at combat and can be considered the very image of a warrior in that he\u2019s fair and honourable preferring the direct approach. When in combat while still radiating calmness Ushii is someone that becomes serious, ruthless and determined and will fight with all his might showing no mercy and is no doubt this state that earned him such a nickname as his skill with the blade when matched with his speed make him unmatched in close combat. Though a veteran of countless battles an interesting thing about Ushii is that he will rarely make use of strategy of any kind opting to instead go for the frontal route which I felt was odd for someone with his experience. Beneath his serious nature, however, it can be seen that Ushii is someone that treats everyone that he meets with respect and kindness and is, in fact, an honourable person that believes heavily in tradition and in paying back the debts that he owes to people a side of him that was really surprising.  The character of Ushii I felt was an interesting one as though he was regarded as the ultimate warrior by many he had neither the cunning and deceptiveness that was shown by the likes of Usagi or the arrogance of Inounoshishi seemingly preferring to go with calmness and strength of arms instead. The fact that he had a somewhat kinder and more honourable side to him I felt was an interesting contrast that proved that sometimes even the fiercest of warriors can have a more human side to them that no one realises. \\n\\n\r\nAMV \\n\\n\r\nThe animation for the series I felt was pretty good especially with regards to the combat scenes that show the battles that make up the contest itself. The individual designs for each of the characters I felt were also pretty good as it gave each character a unique look that matched well with what their personality was like. Though the series was set in modern day Tokyo it notably did not feature any of the cities notable landmarks which I felt was something that they could have added in to make the combat scenes more dramatic. Music wise the series I felt had a very catchy opening theme that helped set the tone for the series being a powerful one while the ending theme also did a good job of inducing a sense of peace. Both of these were helped greatly by the visuals that the opening and ending themes make use of. In terms of voice acting, I felt that overall the voice cast did an excellent job in voicing their respective characters. In particular, I feel that Ayane Sakura, Saori Hayami, and Hiromi Igarashi deserve some particular praise as I felt that they did an excellent job in portraying their respective characters \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn overall Juni Taisen, I felt was an interesting anime that had as its main strong points an interesting premise, excellent story, well-designed characters, excellent combat scenes and excellent music and voice acting. The premise of Juni Taisen itself isn\u2019t actually anything new to the genre as we have seen the idea of a massive battle royal before such as in Akame Ga Kill and in the Fate Zero series but what makes the premise of Juni Taisen special is the fact that victories in this contest not only secure prestige and riches for the house whose representative won the battle but also affects the real-world borders that the houses control in the world as well. The idea of using such contests to determine the influence that each of the faction has on the world stage was an interesting idea as it replaced the notion of conventional war with a battle royal that pits 12 fighters against each other. The fact that each of the main characters had a well designed and developed backstory that detailed their origins and motivations for joining the Juni Taisen was also something that I enjoyed and appreciated as it added depth to them. The overall story for the series while revolving around each of the battles that were fought between the fighters was also intermingled with memories of the fighters past that was shown in between the battles that were fought between them. These past memories I felt did a really good job at not just establishing the origin stories of each of the fighters but also did well to show their development that led to them developing the personalities that they will take into the Juni Taisen itself.  \\n\\n\r\nIn overall Juni Taisen was a series that I really enjoyed watching as it not only had an intriguing premise, but it combined this with a strong story and interesting characters and well-designed combat scenes. The decision to use the past memories as a means to show the characters development that led to the Juni Taisen was also rather notable and only served to improve their development. As a final score, I would say that Juni Taisen deserves a score of 10/10. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Honestly this isn't explained at all and don't expect any explanation about this, the writers simply don't give a damn about writing a coherent scenario.\r\nYou know about character development, right? Well, when a character gets character development in this anime (via flashbacks), they are killed right away. Predictable doesn't even start to describe how terribad this is. The viewer doesn't knowanything about the background of the characters still alive, thus the viewer has no reason to care about them, thus this show is condemned to be trash until the very end.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scenes are fine, but since the viewer doesn't feel attached to any of the characters (since they either don't have any character depth, or will die shortly after getting some via a flashback), they have absolutely no appeal whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nThere are 12 characters, 12 episodes, one killed by episode, the only depth they give to the characters is when they will be killed, so it doesn't contribute at all to the \"story\" (or rather lack of).\\n\\n\r\nDon't waste your time.\\n\\n\r\nDropped at Episode 6 when main character got killed.",

            "content": "Juuni Taisen is a 'Battle Royale' type of anime written by Nisio Isin of Monogatari fame. The premise is about a tournament that is held every 12 years where the participants are mercenaries who are each named after the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac and the winner will have a wish granted. There is also no main character in the show so the one that'll win is supposedly up in the air.\r\nKnowing this, you'd probably expect a cool show where we get to see crazy mercenaries skewering each other for 12 episodes, which is what I expected.. Instead I got a show that feelslike it's desperate to fill its episode count with as much philosophical monologues that aren't supported by the weight of the anime, as well as pointless character backstories and having the participants stand around and not kill each other for as long as possible.\\n\\n\r\nThis show attempts to avoid having a main character by focusing on a different one in each episode and killing them off straight after showing you their backstory - the duration of which ranges from half an episode to an episode and a half. While the battles usually come down to one hit kills in about 2 mintues. And the ones that last longer than that, are usually due to philosophical inner monologues the characters have while standing in one location and doing absulotely nothing. Not to mention many battles stop momentum midway for no in series reason and are handled poorly in terms of choreography.\\n\\n\r\nNot only are the character backstories an intrusion and constantly breaks whatever immersion you may have in a battle happening in the present but they're also entirely pointless since the characters identies and personalities and how they formed their current personalities have no bearing on how they die in the battle, with the exception of the Ox and Tiger participants where it happened to be relevant for once. \\n\r\nAlso these backstories are way too long and only inform us about basic traits that we could've picked up on just by seeing their actions in the present - \"this character is a drunk soldier\", \"this character is greedy\", \"this character is a pacifict\" and so on and so forth. So all of that feels like a waste of time since there's not enough content in this story to justify the 12 episode count which feels bloated in the long run.\\n\\n\r\nSo after all that wasted time and boredom you'd think the show will at least reward us with a good ending, right? Nope, the winner of the battle turns out to be someone who'd have to be a complete moron if he'd lost since he had an ability that (trying not to spoil here) gave him an overwhelming advantage that had very few chances of losing. Not to mention that this ability was never displayed throughout the series all for the sake of a weak twist ending. Also there's a revelation midway about what else is at stake in this tournament that goes absolutely nowhere and the wish that the winner gets is only an excuse to have more philosophical ramblings take up most of the last episode as well instead of actually delivering on that idea. Which is really pathetic and boring if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nVisually this show looks kind of ugly and cheap. while the character designs have cool body proportions and faces that aren't generic stocky crap, their accessories and costumes look ridiculous and the color mixes don't always match up that well. And though it does manage to pull off some cool looking individual scenes from time to time, the animation is sloppy as a whole and it often takes shortcuts when it comes to more complicated motions. It also suffers more than it should considering characters half the time just stand in one location and don't do much. It even has some random CGI near the end that surprisingly wasn't that bad, but was jarring nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of soundtrack there's some ok techno and rock tunes that don't stand out but serve their purpose and the voice acting and sound design is passable even though the former doesn't take much effort since most of the dialogue is emotionless monologues anyway.\\n\\n\r\nSo there you go, a death game anime that does nearly everything wrong, brings Nisio Isin's writing quality in to question (as if it wasn't questionable already) and worth watching only for the occasional gore, but even in that respect there are countless better choices out there than this. So yeah a completely skippable show that I regret wasting my time watching, so naturally I wasted even more time reviewing it.. I don't know, don't judge me.",

            "content": "So it's very premature to be criticizing this show on the actual story, but so far the BEST and WORSE aspects of this show are the same characteristics. The story and more specifically the predictability of who will win.\r\nUnlike fate, future diaries, battle royal, (hunger games in a way), and almost every other battle royal. THERE IS NO PLOT ARMOR. We don't have a main character that \"Must survive\" or that everything centers around. At first you are like oh yeah Boar is the main character totally a bad ass going to win it all..... \r\nSPOILER\r\nBut NOPE dies right in the first episode. Watching itnow I feel like I know who wins due to a very obvious story fault, but even so I still feel like they might throw in a curve ball and knock us all away.\\n\\n\r\nThe downside is so far aside from Snake which their is tons of discussions about, they have all died in the order of the zodiac. This kind of defeats the purpose of not having plot armor, or not knowing who wins if you know the story they based this on. Even so I'm hoping snake is the exception and throws that idea out the window for the second half of the show. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless this show is fantastic, one of the better battle royal series I've watched thus far, would defiantly recommend this to anyone.\\n",

            "content": "Ah, Juuni Taisen, one of the series I enjoyed the most last year. It took me a while to finally write this review, but here it is.\r\nFirst, I see way too many people complaining that the story was \"predictable\" because the ending theme shows who was gonna die in order. But honestly, if this is the reason why you're mad at this anime, you totally missed its point. This was obvious from the beginning. \r\n- Story 8/10\r\nThis is the original 12 Zodiac Animals story told as a battle royale. The story follows the order of the original myth - The last one to arrive atGod's party (or Heavenly Gate, or the Emperor's party, depending on which version you know) is the first one to die; The first one to arrive is the winner.\\n\\n\r\nYou see characters representing each one of the animals killing each other until there's only one left - A typical battle royale, so if you're in the mood for some free violence with fun characters, jump on it!\\n\\n\r\nThe story is, as I said, predictable, but that is if you know the right order of the 12 Zodiac Animals. If you don't, you have the option of simply not watching the ending and everything will be a surprise to you. If you want an unpredictable show this is the only tip I can give you.\\n\\n\r\nObviously nobody would know this when the anime started airing, but now it's a possible option.\\n\\n\r\n- Characters 8/10\\n\r\nThis is where this show shines. All characters have their own personalities and all of them have a unique character design, mostly with traits of their respective zodiac animals. It's almost impossible to not find one that you're gonna like, even if it's one that die early. Since some of them do die very early, they have little time to make themselves likeable. The character design is the first thing to call your attention, to make you curious, and them you have at least a basic explanation of the characters' personalities and backstory, this way you can decide your favorite. Sadly the chance of you getting attached to someone who won't last long is very high. Some of them were a lot of wasted potential so it could fit the order of the original myth, and this is the only reason why I don't give them the highest score.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound 9/10\\n\r\nI'm absolutely in love with the opening theme, even a year later, and also love the ending theme a lot. The soundtrack was decent, to be quite honest I don't remember much of it, but I assume it suited the anime pretty well since it didn't leave me with any negative impression.\\n\\n\r\n- Art & Animation 8/10\\n\r\nThe art is much better than the manga's, and less cutesy than the novel's, it was well adaptated in the anime. Sorry, Hikaru Nakamura, I love you, but your original design made the characters too cute for this show, Chikashi Kadekaru's style was better.\\n\r\nThe animation was good. Not exceptional but decent, at least most of the time. Although I admit the quality dropped in a few later parts. The dark atmosphere suited the story well, the use of CGI was well done. I don't really have many complains here.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall 9/10\\n\r\nI loved this show. Everything about it was interesting to me, the characters were attractive enough for me to want to learn more about them, the battle itself made me curious to know how it would be developed, how the deaths would happen, and I was really curious to know everyone's wishes, specially the winner's. This was a show that held my attention because it kept me interested in what was gonna happen next, even if the ending was predictable, the story was still good enough for me to want to now the means to the end.\\n\r\nJuuni Taisen is a good anime for those who are into action shows, I would definitely recommend it.",

            "content": "This is one of those shows I loved so much that I started plotting how a Western live-adaptation would go about it.\r\n-The story, whilst nothing TOO creative, still adds a nice little spin on the 'Battle Royal' genre by making all the characters resemble the Chinese Zodiac animals. The show usually eliminates one contender per episode which is fine BUT it kinda tells you at the start of the episode who it's going to be by giving you all their backstory (not ALWAYS the case but just have it in mind). This personally doesn't ruin it for me as it's still as much of asurprise as the start of the episode and the journey of the episode is definitely still interesting enough to watch. The ending also very satisfying and not one of those cop-out shows that are becoming all too familiar these days - the 'winner' is surprising and the 'prize' is also cool.\\n\\n\r\n- Art and sound nothing special what you would expect from shows now a days (which is actually pretty high quality).\\n\\n\r\n- Each character definitely has their own distinct personality and has an interesting backstory to watch. The show begins with presenting you a supposed protagonist in the 1st episode and then completely pulls the rug out from under you which was a nice surprise and something I hadn't seen before in an anime. You can start to root for one character to win but for me personally I just had characters I didn't want to win. The backstory for the twin characters does drag on for too long (goes over two episodes) and kinda takes you outta the story for a bit but a minor failing.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Basically an anime Hunger Games with very interesting characters.",

The characters are unique and diverse, but at the same time characters based on the zodiac (be it Eastern and/or Western) isn\u2019t all that unique or creative.

I don\u2019twant to compare it to other \u201dbattle royale deathmatch\u201d anime, but both AgK and MGRP had better stories and characters than this.

A group of warriors with special abilities are asked to engage in a battle-royale and the last warrior standing will be granted any one wish that they desire.\r\nWhile it sounds like a Fate/Stay Night rip-off, it's not. Not even close. Because while the Fate franchise manages to balance the deeper meanings behind wars, their aftermath and it's futility with jaw-dropping action sequences and well developed characters, Juuni Taisen barely manages to deliver a cohesive plot and on more than one occasion falls flat on it's face. \r\nThe standout qualities of the show areundoubtedly it's Art/animation and Soundtrack. The fight sequences (although few) are well animated and the soundtrack does an adequate job of keeping up with both the action and the moments of calm. Another positive quality of the show is that it delivers on the concept of a battle-royale very well. The shifting alliances and inevitable betrayals come with blistering speed, sometimes so quickly that it's upsetting.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacterization and Story are of little consequence as at no point in time does the show really make you care about the characters and their respective motivations, although some of them possess curious (if not badass) abilities. Indeed the only 'twists' that come in the show are the rate at which participants are killed. However, given the long and tedious flashback that is shown immediately before their deaths, one can't help but think of some episodes as a monumental waste of time.  \\n\\n\r\nConceptually, Juuni Taisen had all the ingredients of a proper and even fun Battle-Royale story, but it took itself too seriously by trying to attach deeper meanings to it's plots and characters. The only reason I'm giving it a score of '5' is because despite all it's flaws, the show still prompted me to binge watch it in a single sitting. Maybe it was like reading a bad novel. Once you're past the halfway point, you want to see it through to the end. If for no other reason than to satisfy yourself by saying \"When I start something, I finish it.\"    \\n\\n",

            "content": "It isn\u2019t often that I pick up anime on the spot, but, as you probably could guess, I did so with Juuni Taisen. I just remember myself looking through the currently airing anime, saw a fairly simple premise, and thought I\u2019d give something a shot I normally wouldn\u2019t. I am glad I did so, actually.\r\nStory:\r\nIf you have any clue as to what a \u201cBattle royale\u201d is, you\u2019ll have a decent grasp of how the story of Juuni Taisen is set up. Twelve warriors, each representing an animal from the Chinese zodiac, battling to the death trying to get a single wish granted. Simple, isn\u2019t it?In fact, this story is almost too barren at points.\\n\\n\r\n\tWhilst the story manages to keep focused on the war itself, the part we came to see, it then sacrifices world-building. How can this war be arranged? Who set it up? How did they erase an entire city\u2019s worth of citizens? Things like this are basically just left in the air, and whilst I can understand leaving some things unexplained, these questions bugged me throughout the whole anime, and I was constantly hoping to get explanations eventually, only to then get a very minor scene at about midway, and that\u2019s it. You could say they knew what they needed to focus on, but it\u2019s not like the story structure of this anime was even that complicated.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nSo, you might be wondering, where did they focus on, if not the story? The battles? Well, even that isn\u2019t the case, actually. Instead, Juuni Taisen decided to build on our twelve warriors a bit, by essentially giving everyone a single episode where they were the spotlight, flashbacks and all. Just saying that out loud doesn\u2019t sound that bad, right? At least they treated everyone equally, you may think.\\n\\n\r\n\tWell, it is true that pretty much all of the characters got an equal amount of background, they basically shot themselves in the foot at the same time. If it wasn\u2019t obvious already, I can tell you that a single episode is not enough time to get the viewer to care about any given character. Especially when a lot of the runtime of every episode was just those flashbacks, which weren\u2019t even that creative. So, to sum this up, they developed every character, but then in turn didn\u2019t develop anybody enough. Parallels the phrase \u201cJack of all trades but master of none\u201d quite well.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound:\\n\r\nIt\u2019s unfortunate how much potential Juuni Taisen had, only to then end up rather disappointing in the end. By that I meant that the first episode especially had above average animation-quality, and some great choreography to boot. The animation wasn\u2019t really ever as impressive as back then, and by episode 9 I can only assume the budget got so abysmal that they had to resort to CG animation. I\u2019m not kidding. For just one episode, the scenes in present time were in CG, whilst the flashback-scenes of the episode had just really poor regular animation. It wasn\u2019t as bad afterward, sure, but the score for the animation overall suffered heavily due to that one episode.\\n\\n\r\n\tSo, when one comes to watch a battle royale story, it\u2019s understandable that they would like some action, or at least mind-games, correct? Seems like the people creating Juuni Taisen didn\u2019t quite get that memo, however. Yes, ironically enough, this battle royale anime actually has very bare-bones action. And no, this is not a battle royale that isn\u2019t supposed to have action, it\u2019s meant to be a brawl. So it certainly started disappointing me when I saw how short every fight of the show was. That, and only a couple characters got an actual satisfying death, and a select few of the people who didn\u2019t, felt almost rushed or unfinished. \\n\\n\r\n\tIn terms of sound, I don\u2019t have much to say. There aren\u2019t any tracks that were that memorable, although I do remember it being passable overall. The opening song, Rapture by Panorama Panama Town, was a delightful surprise that I\u2019m listening to right now as I\u2019m writing this, in fact. The ending was also decent, although definitely not on the same level.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nSo far, I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you thought the first paragraph was from a completely different review, but maybe it all starts to make sense here. Despite falling short of even good on basically every category, Juuni Taisen pulled through in one aspect; Its concept.\\n\\n\r\n\tNot every anime has to strife to be amazing, and I feel like the author of Juuni Taisen definitely got that. The story was so simplistic that it didn\u2019t need to do anything outstanding or unique. The animation didn\u2019t need to be breathtaking, the characters didn\u2019t need to be developed too much other that giving the viewers an opportunity to differentiate each of them. If anything, the character-designs were so unique already that they didn\u2019t even need to go much beyond that. If you look at Juuni Taisen as what it is instead of what it could\u2019ve been, it isn\u2019t disappointing in the slightest. If anything, it delivered its promise, and its simple premise got me interested, kept me hooked, and ended the story with me having a smile on my face the whole time. A job well done.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nFate/Zero was a battle roayle anime that excelled at creating memorable characters with varied ideals and ambitions, and pinned those ideals against each other beautifully. And despite having insufferable main characters, Mirai Nikki succeeded as a battle royale with giving a unique set of powers for each contestant. Juuni Taisen, however, was a good battle royale anime by being just that. It didn\u2019t do anything exceptionally well, if anything it was disappointing in a lot of ways, but Juuni Taisen\u2019s fun-factor and simplicity are the things that made it enjoyable as a watch. \\n\\n\r\n\tIf you\u2019re a fan of battle roayles like me, then definitely give Juuni Taisen a shot. If not, then I say it\u2019s up to your own discretion. It\u2019s not something I\u2019d go out of my way to recommend to people, but to those that are curious, I say go right ahead. Take it as what it is and you\u2019ll definitely get your wish granted.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 7",

            "content": "Although I've seen my fair share of anime, Juuni Taisen will forever be memorable.\r\nLikes:\r\n1)  The backstorys are unique and explore complex themes.  Even though they usually only span one episode, viewers are left with a well painted picture of each protagonist, which sheds light on both internal and external conflicts we see today.  The pacifist's story was especially clever and touches on the idea of empathy being the missing link in modern day politics.  The twin's story explains why charity fails to solve the underlying causes of human suffering (our own corrupted values).  And tiger's story touches on moral subjectivitybut more importantly, what it means to hold fundamental principles and WHY we hold those beliefs.  \\n\\n\r\n2) The ending was fantastic.  Rat's dilemma really makes us consider what our purpose in life is and what we truly want.  Most people go through life seeking their dreams and aspirations without truly understanding what those aspirations are.  Rat's internal conflict and eventual decision, especially pertinent as he is a high schooler, highlights the problems of modern day education (being a \"cog in the social machine\"): brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nDislikes:\\n\\n\r\n1) Fight's could have been longer and better choreographed.  I was oftentimes dissapointed by the overwhelming character buildup and underlwhelming death scene.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Juuni Taisen is able to fit a great deal of content into a 12 episode series.  The story takes a common premise but like the Fate series, is able to incorporate insightful philosophies while keeping the episodes interesting.  The series is easily a 7.\\n\\n\r\nBTW\\n\r\nI don't have a problem with main characters dying.  I'm a fan of the Game of Thrones style.  Those who aren't: beware.\\n",

            "content": "I've only finished three episodes so far and I can already say that this show has had a lot of potential, but, just as a lot of others have said, began to fade away very quickly. As a writer, I tend to be fair and unbiased when it comes to subjects such as what I enjoy and don't, and also tend to not let my personal interests get in the way of what I think is the score of the show. So, after three episodes, I am going to give my own score of what I think of it so far.\r\nThe art is pretty unique.It has a 3D aspect to it, but sways more with the 2D character style in terms of movement. The environment is interactive with how each of the characters react with different situations, and every character has a specific interest in what type of environment they wish to be a part of. What I like most about the environment is that each character is assigned to what they feel is most comfortable, such as the Monkey and Rat hiding within the sewer to keep themselves safe, while the others scour above to look for their next victim.\\n\\n\r\nBut the show isn't all about the environment and artwork and how good they are. It also has its downsides. This show, already, goes way too fast. And don't get me wrong, I don't mean timewise\u2014characters that someone seems fond of always gets killed off early, such as the Dog. I loved that character the moment I saw him. I knew he would be strong, but when the anime kills him off so early, it makes me disappointed that I won't get to see someone I enjoy watching prevail instead of some other phony character.\\n\\n\r\nThat is what I want to talk about next: perspective and the enjoyment of characters. This anime doesn't give us the fulfillment of having one character and being in that perspective. Instead, with every episode, it switches around and causes mass confusion. Of course, it provides us with backstory of everyone, but it never sticks with one character, so we don't get to see how they develop emotionally. I think the closest we got to having a change in emotional view of the battle was the Chicken before she died. But, sadly, that was it. I think it was misleading to start out with Boar and have her killed off, because it made me very confused as to why they would kill a main character.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, after talking about what I had previewed in my mind and what I wanted to express, I would give this show just a 6 for now. It's enjoyable, but not very good.",

Where do I even begin?\r\nI guess I'll start this off by saying i watched this show weekly with a friend which made it more enjoyable. There was a lot of whiskey and \"Holy Shits!\" on our journey through this show. It was a breath of fresh air that is for sure. Don't get me wrong, this isn't the greatest anime of all time by any means. I did like it though.\r\nThe reason this show captured me was because how out of left field it was. A show that shows the backstory for almost an entire episode just to have them almost always be the next to get brutally murdered. If you like a sort of hunger games plot, but one that is actually decent and entertaining, then watch this. All the loops this show throws you through is hilarious. Expect what happens in the first few episodes to happen all through out. This show gives zero fucks. The way me and my friend found that out was in the earlier episodes when the Fighter of The Boar got loads of dialogue. Only to get full nelsoned by a necromancer and get brutally stabbed.\\n\\n\r\nThat caused me and my pal a giant \"OH...FUCK\" which is what this show always puts you through. This is one of those \"turn your brain off\" anime. Don't think too hard about it while watching it you'll probably drop it. For example in the back story leading up to the Rat Nezumi's victory. The tiger asks him if he wants to drink with her. He replies \"I'm underaged.\" I'm over here thinking.. You're in highschool fighting a death game for a black market gambling system. I don't think society gives a fuck if you get intoxicated. Just little things like that are hilarious. You also get 1 wish if you claim victory, so who cares about the law? I don't know lol. Solid 7/10 from me. Juuni Taisen was pretty awesome. If you're bored of constant slice of life and just want a WTF experience. Watch this!",

            "content": "Juuni Taisen is disengaging, inconsistent, annoying, but oddly satisfying right at the last moments. \r\nIn terms of story, it sounds interesting at first with the battle arena idea and the whole culture of replacing country wars and conflict with a single tournament, but it isn't even consistent with that. The world building sucks, and seriously required more details because most viewers will be left confused rather than informed and interested. I will talk about the ending later.  \r\nNow about the whole concept. When you think of battle arenas, do you think of some cool battles, tension and suspense, not knowing who the victor willbe, potentially some really crazy twists that add a big shock to the battle? Well you won't find it here. When there is actual fighting in the show, I'm actually feeling hyped because it seems like the action is going to be really great! But all the fights and non fights were very anticlimactic and the precise word for this is...\"stupid.\" I will say, the idea that each character had their own unique way of exploiting or finding loopholes in the Juuni Taisen was really great - I actually enjoyed seeing the fighters find ways around the rules and ideas of the competition and kind of dive into their minds with their planning and plotting - such a shame there is not enough of this kind of stuff. I will say this though - one of the characters in particular had a specific loophole that honestly didn't really work for me, it threw off the balance of the show and made them OP and boring.\\n\\n\r\nNo real comment in terms of art and sound, to me it was okay. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter. The thing that stands out most in this show but for negative reasons. Firstly the designs are whack. What the hell are half of these people wearing? Some may make sense, for example, military gear or specific clothing for weaponry and equipment. But some have zero meaning and practicality! (I'm looking at Rabbit and Tiger here...) I get that it's supposed to represent the zodiac creature, but you could've done without....some of the things in this show...\\n\\n\r\nSo without spoiling too much, the first episode introduces a character and gives their story and then a twist happens. This was okay just for the first episode, the problem is they regurgitated this exact formula for every character and it was very boring and disengaging to watch. Not to mention, they went in full detail for like 3/4's of each episode for some of the backstories of the characters - I believe it was supposed to create an empathetic effect that would make the audience interested and captivated. Instead, like many have already said, made it predictable and in fact have the opposite intended effect and I actually didn't really care for the characters with these obsessively long and drawn out  sappy back stories.\\n\\n\r\n(More detail: I will say, some of the back stories were done okay or pretty well. For example, Dog's backstory was actually done well - it was done in a way where it was actually relevant to the Juuni taisen, like the transition into his backstory was done smoothly and his story was short and simple! Because of this, I actually enjoyed his character! Another example I guess would be Rat who also had a short backstory - literally two lines of dialogue, which was actually perfect for his character and made viewers understand him)\\n\\n\r\nContinuing on from before, they skip some of actually interesting characters stories which was actually so annoying - why give 15 minutes of screen time to someone I don't care about when you could give at least a few minutes to someone quite exciting and who seriously needs context?\\n\r\nPlease readers, if you ever make a show and want character contexts, under 5 minutes is enough please don't go on for 3/4's of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nNow the ending of the show will either make viewers quite annoyed. Or make some, like me, oddly satisfied. I won't say exactly what it is, but it was the only thing (I suppose you could also apply this to the twins? But they have two episodes of backstory so no.) that was actually different in this show, something that made it not a typical and predictable, not some sob story or some sappy thing. Instead it was a realistic depiction of a real persons thoughts that put things into a unique perspective. And I agree with the character's choice in that episode. It made a lot of sense and it was real. \\n\\n\\n\r\n(TL;DR) So, as you can see the problems with this show lie with character and story and the only good episode was the last. However, if you are looking for a obscure guilty pleasure with weird characters and a bad story then you have found the right show right next to DMMD! If you just treat it like a comedy, the \"fights\" just get so much better. Nice move leaving out two of the more interesting character's context/backstories out! If I could wish for anything I wish I could unsee Rabbit's character design. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Juuni Taisen is disengaging, inconsistent, annoying, but oddly satisfying right at the last moments. \\n",

            "content": "Juuni Taisen's premise is straightforward and unsurprising: twelve warriors, each carrying the name and various traits of one of the animals of the Chinese Zodiac, engage in a brutal free-for-all battle royale. Why? All for the sake of having any one wish of their choosing granted. If it sounds familiar, it is because it very much is, the premise being a near-exact imitation of the Fate series'. So the question remains: does Juuni Taisen do enough to set itself apart in this bloody free-for-all, wish-granting niche? Or does it fall flat on its face, and accept forgettable mediocrity, achieving little besides its initial zodiac gimmickto forge a new identity for itself?\\n\\n\r\nIf someone were to stop watching Juuni Taisen after only a couple of episodes, they would probably remain under the impression that the show's strong suit is of a visual nature. In these opening episodes, animation is fluid and crisp, making early bouts of violence and action a genuine pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nIf they were to keep watching, however, they would no doubt have to eat their words. As the show progresses, the animation absolutely falls apart, making it increasingly difficult to understand characters' movements, and just downright painful to experience. In fact, the 8th episode is probably one of the worst, visually, that I have seen all year, due to shockingly low-quality animation, and background + character art that is so poorly done that it is, at times, a struggle to even understand what you are looking at anymore.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, it does pick up a bit after the horrendous 8th episode, but it never again meets the high standard the show establishes in its introductory episodes, which is quite a shame.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is overall okay, maintaining a dark, somber palette throughout, which does complement the show's overall tone and themes appropriately. Most of the character designs are well-done too, going hand-in-hand with each character's associated Zodiac, but some feel a bit over-the-top, especially Usagi's, considering the otherwise serious tone throughout.\\n\\n\r\nJuuni Taisen's narrative effort is an uphill battle, especially considering how similarly it sets itself up to other, much more beloved anime. Unfortunately, it doesn't really do much to distinguish itself from these other works, and what little it does attempt to do, ultimately falls short and ends up not worth investing over 4 hours to get to.\\n\\n\r\nA major fault on Juuni Taisen's part is that it decides to spend each of its 12 episodes focusing on one of the Zodiac warriors, revealing their backstories and unfolding the events of the war through their eyes, all in one shot. The problem with this is that no character ends up fleshed-out enough nor memorable enough to garner any audience interest in their ultimate fate. Without a central character arc, the show has to rely mainly on shock twists (i.e. unexpected deaths) to keep viewers watching, which, while not the best way to tell a good story, would be a decent idea. Yet, we are still subject to flashback after flashback, with way too much of the show's airtime wasted on failed attempts to flesh out characters who, ultimately, have little impact on both overarching narrative and audience.\\n\\n\r\nAside from this significant weakness, a few of the characters' backstories are somewhat intriguing, especially in their relation to the respective warrior's present-day situation.\\n\\n\r\nIn the grand scheme of things, it is the Zodiac war, not the flashbacks, that are most intriguing to watch. Fake alliances, rivalries, tricks, bonds being formed, and all of the other various political aspects of the war are cool to watch in action, and benefit quite well from the show's shifting perspective structure, as we are privy to how different characters feel about and approach similar situations.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I found odd was that the final episode occurs post-war and focuses on one particular character and a dilemma that they are currently facing. The details around their ability and the nature of this dilemma are introduced way too late to have any significant impact on the viewer, and the whole thing just seems kind of jarring and inconsequential, especially considering the climax had already passed.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is a mixed bag for the most part. Approximately half of the warriors are forgettable and are of little importance in the grand scheme of things, while others stand out as power players. Sharyuu's pacifistic personality works well as a contrast to the situation she is placed in, and, ironically, is one of the most exciting to follow for this reason alone. Ushii is also likable and is given standout moments here and there, but is for the most part, appealing for his coolness factor as opposed to multi-dimensional, nuanced character writing. In fact, the majority of the cast is characterized in a rushed, stereotypical nature, but the show doesn't seem to want to be more than a standard action entry anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAs a villain, Usagi is satisfactory if only for his unsettling personality alone. Crazed and bloodthirsty, he functions as the main driving force behind the series' bloodshed and does feel like a real threat for the most part. On the other hand, he is also very one-note and is in no way more complex or nuanced than he appears at first glance, which is a bit of a let-down.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a dumb, enjoyable time, Juuni Taisen is not that bad of a choice. Of course, there are other anime that share its battle-royale flair while, in addition, managing to juggle profound themes and intriguing character writing with their action quite well. A prime example of this is Fate/Zero, which should 100% be watched before even considering a show like this. Nonetheless, once you have finished with the brainier shows and find yourself looking for something similar, Juuni Taisen is a watered-down yet still acceptable variation to try out.\\n\\n\r\nFans of pure action anime may enjoy the series' commitment to violence and bloodshed, but potentially also find themselves let down by the show's selection of fight scenes. Though intense, visceral and competently-choreographed, a large part of Juuni Taisen's fights don't end up lasting very long, which could certainly turn off viewers who have just waded through the endless flashbacks hoping to finally experience some actual action.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Juuni Taisen does manage to offer its viewers an opportunity to experience some mindless, action-packed fun. On top of that, the typical viewer will likely find at least one character to root for, one fight to take their breath away, and one backstory to find themselves sympathizing with.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond these few positives, the show has too many glaring flaws to merit being considered anything more than mediocre. Flashbacks stunt the flow of the narrative and offer little in the way of satisfaction and enjoyment, characterization is too tropey and simplistic, fights are cut way too short, and the visual presentation makes viewing a painful and confusing experience in later episodes.",

And that's the best grade I can personally give it. Meaning it's pretty shitty made. And that's all there is to say about it. They tried, I guess...\r\nIf you want something easy, then go ahead and give this a try. But if you where looking for something that is actually good and worth while. Move along. \r\nIf you make it to the end. At least you have been warned to not take it to serious. \r\nIt starts ofaverage but ends in pure disappointment. As a battle royal named Juuni Taisen where all opponents have super natural powers it should set of to quite an interesting mix. Where the winner takes it all and is given one wish that will be ultimately granted. \\n\r\nBut it turn very fast very flat. \\n\r\nLike a bad and illogical come back from a sibling. The depth just turns laughably stupid. Without the laughs. \\n\\n\r\nOn the way to complete disappointment you get to be half halfheartedly engaged, without having to get serious or in depth, with _some_ of the characters. The characters that by the way starts of as deep and traumatized. In a disappointing try to give the viewer a sense of connection to the twelve main characters. Which is impossible since the trauma of the twelve characters are way out of hand for your average Joe to feel connected with. They are all just to over powering to comprehend. The only thing good about this anime is that the characters are fairly well made and in balance with each other.\\n\r\nThey are all represented as from the twelve zodiac signs and they all have different superpowers. We get to watch them on their way to becoming who they are and how they got to this battle royal called Junni Taisen that happens every twelfth year. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime tries to take on the philosophical question of individuality and how we are formed by the life we choose to live under the circumstances that are given us. But it fails to give an adequate answer to it completely. \\n\r\nThe monotone motion that brings the story ahead turn very quickly too flat to keep up with the serious note that was set in the beginning of each episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's all it offers unfortunately. \\n\\n\r\nI personally had higher hopes for this one and wanted to believe that the end would give some clarity to the blunt flatness it presented. But all hope was lost and now I want to die. Truly horrible anime, in all the bad ways. I regret everything. \\n\\n\r\n(My wish if I would have won the Juni Taisen would be omnipotence, of course.)",

            "content": "There's nothing complicated about 12 super warriors in a battle royale. And it's not like this one is exactly ground-breaking. The universe is not well fleshed out and a lot of the plot is pretty predictable. Death flags everywhere.\r\nI still enjoyed the show, the fight animations look great and though it's not difficult to predict who's gonna win, it's still fun to guess. \r\nWhat's nice is that each character gets their own episode, fleshing out their back story so we can get an idea of what sort of background each of the warriors comes from. Each character is memorable in their own right and noneof them are completely unlikable. \\n\\n\r\nThere's two main criticisms of this anime: the first is that it's really predictable. But I would say that the predictable nature was established as a given for the series from episode 1. Ultimately the show isn't about who dies, but how they lived and how they died. It's about the journey rather than the destination. Not that the show is all that deep, but it's not entirely brainless.\\n\\n\r\nThe second criticism is the ending. A lot of people disagree with the winner's choices and while I don't want to spoil too much, the show does reach a satisfying conclusion. \"Wtf I wouldn't have wished for that\" is not a valid criticism because they haven't lived the life of any of these characters. Ultimately, all of the warriors are human, with human desires (well except rabbit) and human weaknesses despite their ridiculous weapons and powers.",

            "content": "Before I start this off, please know that this review is entirely based on my own enjoyment of the anime, and so it's heavily biased. I suppose reviews are usually like that, so even if you just wanna read reviews if you personally disliked the anime, you might enjoy seeing a different viewpoint.\r\nBut now let's get to the actual review. If you plan to watch it and don't want spoilers, don't read past this, though. Cause I'm gonna take this apart a little, and there's gonna be some little spoilers.\r\nAt first, I wasn't gonna watch Juuni Taisen. It was in the \"New episode\"-section whenever Iwent to my streaming site of choice, and I didn't really notice it. That was until my friend, a sworn lover of Battle Royale anime texted me some screenshots, telling me to watch it as soon as possible.\\n\\n\r\nSo me, bored and having wanted to pick up another seasonal anime just said \"ok, sure\" and I went to said steaming site of choice and checked out the first episode. I'm not a big fan of Battle Royale stuff, usually. It's cool in wrestling, but in anime? Eh, I had yet to find something I enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nI definetely enjoyed Juuni Taisen.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 7/10\\n\r\nA lot of people call this show \"predictable\", and they're not wrong. If you know the chinese zodiac, or know the story of \"the Zodiac Race\", you'll know who'll win the anime. Hell, if you watch the ending or even pay attention, you know who'll win. And after two episodes, the old \"Backstory equals Death\"-cliche kind of makes it easy to know who'll die, too, so if you want to be surprised about who dies... Yeah, this probably isn't for you.\\n\r\nSo why did I still give it  seven points, even though the story was predictable and the deaths were mostly unpredictable? Well, the backstories were interesting, the reason the \"Juuni Taisen\" was held was kinda cool, and it was exciting to wonder about who would kill the victim the of the week, how they'd die, etc.\\n\r\nTowards the end of the show, there's even a little plot twist I genuinely didn't expect. I can see how the last episode made people get mad, by the way, but I found it bittersweet, and I like the idea of the winner's wish having been just that.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason it's still only seven of ten, is the fact that sometimes the flashbacks slowed down the flow, alongside some minor stuff, but it's still pretty good in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nArt and animation are definetely pretty well done. There's a lot of CGI, but to my surprise, it wasn't bad. Sure, sometimes, it was a bit weird on some characters in particular, but the action scenes definetely were made really dynamic at times because of it. The art style itself is pretty nice, making the characters look colorful and expressive. I also find a lot of the designs very attractive, which is a plus, if you're a shipper like me.\\n\r\nBackgrounds were fitting too, usually the city the tournament was set in, a lot of battlefields in the flashbacks, sometimes more domestic stuff. The characters fit in them well, and interacted with them a fair bit.\\n\r\nThe way the \"camera\" moved helped making the shots more interesting too. All in all, the art was good, and I liked it a lot. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\r\nThe music, OP and ED included, was honestly really good. Especially the opening is something I listen to on a regular basis now (and the art in it is real good). The OST is all in all enjoyable, not forcing you to pay special attention to it, just setting the mood for the scenes. I can't even say a lot about it, it genuinely just was a good soundtrack. But I'm also known for not knowing music, so this is particularly subjective.\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a great job as well, having just the right amount of ham for some of the characters. I can't really think of any character who didn't have a fitting voice, so kudos.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 8/10\\n\r\nGotta admit: The reason I didn't rate this higher is because my favorite character didn't get any backstory, and I'm salty about it. But they still were a colorful bunch, and I loved them.\\n\r\nThe girls, while all sexy and most of them wearing revealing stuff, each had their own personality without being reduced to a single character trait and being only there for the fanservice. The guys were equally fun, having a range of different body types and age ranges. A lot of them were \"edgy\" (especially Usagi), but that made them more enjoyable to me, because it's the type of edginess that makes something more fun. I liked the weird outfits everyone was wearing to look more like their zodiac sign (Tiger's fake ears, striped bikini and boots and tail-collar thingie, Boar's little hair-buns looking like pig ears and her tusk-earrings, Dog's dog ears and fur-cloak, Rabbit's.. everything), and the overall designs. \\n\r\nTheir powers also were really cool, even if some of them lacked proper explanations on how the hell that would work. So.. yeah. I liked those characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nWith all the edginess, the gore and the crazy action, I found myself really enjoying this show. I'm a bit of a gore-hound already, and Juuni Taisen just really indulged me, giving me rolling hands, impaled torsos and a bulking abomination of reassambled flesh. \\n\r\nIt wasn't a perfect show, but just something you could watch and enjoy the crazy violence and weird plot twists from time to time. I honestly had a lot of fun, even if there's shows I like more.\\n\r\nIt was, what it promised to be, a colorful, crazy gorefest. And I'm glad I watched it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8/10\\n\r\nAs I said, it's not the best show ever. It's got its flaws, it's predictable (if you don't like that) and it was edgy, but it was just really, really fun. I get why people wouldn't like it, or why they'd drop it, but it's a fun watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this marks the end of my super subjective, really biased and kinda messy review. If anyone who hasn't watched this read this until now, and found themselves thinking \"Wow, that sounds kinda fun, I might check it out\", I'd tell them to give it a try. Maybe they'd decide to drop it after a few episodes, or get mad at the sorta cop-out at the end, but.. yeah.\\n\\n\r\nJuuni Taisen definetely made my autumn a little more fun. I'm glad my friend made me watch it.\\n",

            "content": "Juuni Taisen has just finished airing, I enjoyed it quite a bit. So the show is about 12 warriors representing the Chinese Zodiac, in a killing game against each other known as the Juuni Taisen. These warriors have, some subtle, some not so subtle, superpowers of some sort. Whomever wins the Juuni Taisen will be granted one wish of their choosing. Okay, so this anime was initially praised for being truly unpredictable, until you get about 3-4 episodes in then you can see the death order obviously. Although, this is not different from other popular death game shows and doesn't ruin the basis of theshow at all. It definitely lost potential when it showed the order of deaths so abruptly. The art is nothing special, and unfortunately the animation takes a big dip in certain parts of the show, but I don't think that makes it show terrible. I enjoy the character designs, they really play into what the character was meant to represent in the Zodiac. I would recommend this show to somebody who doesn't particularly care about being spoiled about death order, but who wants to see how they would die. I give this show a 7 out of 10. If the order of death would have not been mentioned, then it would have definitely gotten a higher score. This has been your spoiler free but not really review on Juuni Taisen.",

            "content": "The Zodiacs, a Chinese representation of animal sign for every year that gives ones luck, personalty and out look and next year 2018 would be the year of the Dog and it's gonna kill us by biting, Woof, Woof! Ok, so in a city of  half a million people somewhere in China (trust me such ghost city does exist) all been removed to give way to the 12th Zodiac Tournament which takes place every 12 years.  Where 12 of the deadliest mercenary warriors (at least that's what it says) with the names and attributes of the 12 Chinese zodiac animals are pitted againsteach other, the prize, one wish that could change their lives...or at least that's the plot..............but....................:\\n\\n\r\nGood 7, Story: Killing me softly \\n\\n\r\n..........That's not the whole case in this anime, good as it is since it was suppose to be a survival of the fittest, for a while it did deliver some sort of excitement of seeing them duke out with each other, that's the good part, but when one realizes as to how the characters die one by one, one would get the sense that the winner was already decided from the start. Now don't get me wrong , it has a good plot at least in paper, but as it goes on, the fighting and how the character dies becomes less of a priority and the focus was on the backstories of the characters, in a way it does provide some touching moment about some of the characters like Niwa Tori's and Kanae Aira's backstory, where you'll sympathize with them as to the horrors that they have undergone, but all that get's wash down as how evil they become. It's like giving you something nice only to be shock of the strings attached.  \\n\\n\r\nPoor 3, Art: Killing by Disgust\\n\\n\r\nThere goes them Japaneses' over-elaborate sense of crime of fashion, the character illustration were everything were just too ill-fitted, so let's go over them:\\n\\n\r\n  Toshiko In\u014d/Boar- In the start of the tournament we see her dressed for success , so why the heck was she wearing an office attire when she could have wore her outfit when she's killing some mrecs at the start of the first episode?\\n\\n\r\n   Michio Tsukui/Dog- Was he suppose to look like a dog or a werewolf? Cu'z his outfit was just too shabby to even be a hitman, he basically can pass as an mountain man who would kill anybody who stray in his territory.\\n\\n\r\n  Ry\u014dka Niwa/Rooster/Chicken- So, as a chicken , what's up with that pitch fork that she never get;s to used?????Also, she's suppose to look like a chicken and not a club stripper who dresses up like a parrot. Also, the character should have been a man not some chicken shit girl who kills deceptively.  \\n\\n\r\nMisaki Y\u016bki (Sharyu)/Monkey- Ok, she a mix of someone who is suppose to go hiking because of her backpack, green fatigue jacket  and hiking shoes and someone who is going to an  AKB48  audition  with her zettai ryoki, head phone and bloomers, also her tied down hair and glasses add's to her dorkyness. \\n\\n\r\nSumihiko Tsujiie/Ram/Sheep- They should have use the younger version of him, his outfit makes him look like someone who should be in the 1880's era in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nYoshimi S\u014dma/Horse- All that muscle and meat should belong to the Bull.\\n\\n\r\nTakeyasu Tsumita/Snake- Well he's dressed for the occasion, I give him that, but he should be handling a freeze gun and not a flame thrower.\\n\\n\r\n  Nagayuki Tsumita/Dragon- All white, seriously?????Also he ought be carry a flame thrower and not Capt Cold's freeze gun. \\n\\n\r\nUsagi/Rabbit- Face-palm, major crime of fashion, he's like a gay stripper with that big puffy tail , rabbit ears and high heels.\\n\\n\r\n Kanae Aira/Tiger- Ok, so were there any beaches or a pool party going on around the setting that she has to be in a bikini????? Major face-palm, major not dressed for the occasion............ though she does look hot in it. It would have been better if she opted for her Karate Gi than that bikini. \\n\\n\r\n Eiji Kashii/Ox- Long hair, slim body, GAAAAAAYYYYYYYY, also that matador outfit????Sheees, he should be in the Bull Ring duking it with a wild bull, also he should have been the one to have the horse's meat and muscle and use his strrups as his killing weapon and not that Calvary saber.  \\n\\n\r\nTsugiyoshi Sumino (Nezumi)/Rat- His attire makes him look like a member of the Power Rangers, which is too dorky and his hair was just too disgusting that he needs to see a hair stylist.\\n\\n\r\nDuedeculpe- Is there a circus around here, cu'z that where he should be? Or maybe he's pimp, either way he's a major crime of fashion.\\n\\n\r\nI really don't understand why in their back stories them characters were dressed for that occasion and not in this occasion .\\n\\n\r\nGood 7, Sound: Killing me with joy\\n\\n\r\nThe score was for the opening and closing theme, cu's it suited that anime well, and that's that.\\n\\n\r\nPoor 3, Characters: Killing the chef\\n\\n\r\nOk, so, I did mention something about being misplaced, also there is big plot hole as to how they got there special abilities which makes us wonder as how they got it in the first place  , so let's discuss each of them:\\n\\n\r\n  Duedeculpe- The moderator of the Juuni taisen/ Wish granter who has the ability to grant any wish for the victor, so is he a man with influence or a demon? That is the question,given that he can grant such wish like magic and at the same time works like a mafia boss who makes money on the competition.\\n\\n\r\n Tsugiyoshi Sumino (Nezumi)/Rat-  He's the Killing All or Killing by Swarm or wtf kind of killing method he does, but the fact is he hardly kill anyone at all , the death of Ox was with consent and with his \"Hundred Paths\" shit kinda make him a cheater, which is the only way he won, but in the end the wish he choose was to forget the tournament was just too lame . Also him being the obvious winner serves as one reason for my score.\\n\\n\r\n Eiji Kashii/Ox-The Killing Systematically guy, does he do that, cu's it doesn't look that way, cu'z he doesn't show any interest in joining the monkey's peace proposal, also, at the first couple of episode we see him just stab and slash anyone he sees , so where is the systematically there? Looks more like he's killing randomly, his killing should have gone to the rabbit cu'z he is the one who kills systematically.\\n\\n\r\n  Kanae Aira/Tiger- The Killing in a Drunken Rage kind of a girl, she started as a High School girl who is into martial arts who becomes crazy and drowns her sorrow with allota alcohol, so her being this Killing in a Drunken Rage, is not enough to describe her as a whole, she should have been the Killing Psychotically While in a Drunken Rage one ,cu'z in her backstory we did see her running amuck while killing were she see herself no longer a human but an animal and that is where the psychotically part belongs.\\n\\n\r\n Usagi/Rabbit-The psychotic homo, ok so he's the Killing Psychotically guy, but let's not forget even psycho kills systematically so he should have been the Killing Systematically guy and not the Ox.\\n\\n\r\n Nagayuki Tsumita/Dragon and Takeyasu Tsumita/Snake- They are like oil and water that original creator Nisio Isin tries to mix, ok so they both Kill for Money, but they both have a double standard in fact they are a double standard in everyway , they love money and yet we see them threw it away, they're both part of some cult that has different views and worshiped different patron deity  and yet they function as criminal organization. So basically each twin can be any side of the coin, which is why for them to the Killing For Money twins doesn't suit them, Killing Deceptively is what they should be since they're very deceptive not only to others but to each other as well, as seen when the snake get to be killed by the Rabbit the dragon doesn't seem to mind, in fact he even feels relived to see his twin bro dead. also, it was unfair that the snake has to die first, his role should have been utilize further since he has to be the 7th person to die.\\n\\n\r\nYoshimi S\u014dma/Horse- So the man who is the Killing Silently is a pussy, disappointing that he has already lost his nerve the moment he encounters the Ox. Shit, all that muscle and speed , not to mention all the things he has undergone to have all that ability only went to waste. Killing His Time , is what he should be.\\n\\n\r\nSumihiko Tsujiie/Ram/Sheep- This Killing Deceptively old man, shouldn't even be in the tournament , unless the Original Creator uses a younger version of him. His Killing Deceptively doesn't quite make him , since he was more if a bomb and trap  guy,  so Killing Silently should have been his title, also his Killing Deceptively isn't limited to him, cu'z even the boar, chicken and them twins also kill deceptively. \\n\\n\r\n  Misaki Y\u016bki (Sharyu)/Monkey- Ok, she a pacifist and a peace maker who prefers to Kill Peacefully, frankly her character was an oxymoron, cu'z how can she have such title as Killing Peacefully when she hates to see people dying, also, why would she be a merc when it's very obvious that she specializes in negotiations rather than warfare, she prefer to use her kung fu skills than with a weapon such as a gun or a knife.... Frankly the best way to describe her character in general was that she is like a knife in a gunfight or a dove in a flock of raptors, so really she should have the title Killing by Nagging. Also, the part where we see her setting explosive should have been done by the Sheep since he like things that goes BOOM.\\n\\n\r\n  Ry\u014dka Niwa/Rooster/Chicken- Her Killing by Pecking was just sooooo lame , he should have had the rat's Killing All , since she, like them twins, was also as deceptive as them, as seen in her backstory and as we see she does kill all even her own side. \\n\\n\r\n   Michio Tsukui/Dog- As much as I hate to say it , his Killing by Biting suit him well, since dogs do carry rabies.\\n\\n\\n\r\n Toshiko In\u014d/Boar- For her to be this Killing Bounty fully is an understatement, since she has the ability to convince somebody to kill for her ,so she should have been the Killing by Mongering, since she did used some kind of hypnosis to make her sister kill everyone she knows, then again too bad she's the first to die, if we can call it that.\\n\\n\r\nGood 7, Enjoyment: Killing by excitement\\n\\n\r\nIt was exciting when you haven't figure out the order of death, which is good, but as you find out the order, you'll be a bit disgusted , since the one you expect to put up a good fight didn't happen, the one we expect to win didn't happen cu'z there is reverse order of death, soooooooo....\\n\\n\r\nPoor 3, Overall: Everybody Clap Your Hands\\n\\n\r\n..........Was poorly executed, too predictable, and a plothole as to how those contestant got such ability were never mentioned.......season 2???????? Maybe.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This anime is loosely based on the Zodiac Race. Is it worth your time? Definitely. Are you looking for a traditional Battle Royal anime? Then this is not for you.\r\nStory: \r\nThe plot is what you will expect from a battle royal anime, but this time the focus is less on who is going to die, and more of a brief study of the aspirations and mindset each participating character has in this event. In that regard, it's also less about the battles themselves and more about the history and hubris of the characters; and in what way would it lead to their fate. If youare aware of the Zodiac Race, or have seen the first two episodes, then you would know immediately in what order each character will die. Juuni Taisen also heavily utilises tropes of irony and poetry.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe combat scenes are well animated, despite not being the main focus. And the animation on a whole is consistent. There is one particular episode where the quality dipped lower than what's usual for this anime, but it wasn't to the point where the anime suffered. Computer generated animation was used in place of the more common 2D hand-drawn animation in that episode, but it was done in a way that it didn't matter.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art for the characters are well-done as well. Each character has their own distinctive look and are easily recognisable from each other. They also have their own special way of walking and running, which helps sell each of their personalities. The background art doesn't stand out, and works how it was intended. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound direction, there aren't any particular standout soundtracks. There is only one piano track which stood apart from the rest. Otherwise, the opening and ending are standard fare.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, you will find enjoyment out of this series if you have more interest in learning the history of the characters and wondering how they'll die, rather than musing about who will die.\\n\\n",

Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\n\u2726Story\u2726\r\nEssentially a battle royale with edgy and quirky characters with some backstory to them. Nothing else to add, simply a battle fest with a straightforward plot-device and goal, but feels it's just absolutely pointless. Anyhow, the story aspect is simply dull and disappointing.\r\n\u2726Art & Sound\u2726\r\nArt and animation is probably the best part about this Anime. It had some cool action and odd designs.\r\nMusic on the other hand, can't remember anything memorable. Fair enough.\r\n\u2726Character\u2726\r\nAll sorts of character with their own past and reasons of being inthe whole \"battle royale game\". All have their own skill sets and surprisingly enough dumb \"progression and finale\" for the most of them. I just couldn't care less about characters for the most part. And somehow, my first guess who would \"win the game\" after first one fell in it. Was spot on. And that characters ability was as well rather easy to guess and just dull usage in this Anime.\\n\\n\r\nVariety of stereotypes and backstories were nice. Aside that it was rather boring.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\u2726\\n\r\nI remember seeing trailer before this Anime got released. It seemed edgy and fun. Something right up my alley. But now that I watched and saw it being simply a \"battle royale\" ... with rather disappointing combat, characters and the whole ending and how it ended. I simply feel I got scammed. It wasn't anything about being hyped or not. It simply felt dull as I were watching.\\n\\n\r\nIn another words.. it wasn't my cup of tea and almost everything in there felt so pointless by the end of it.\\n",

I enjoy horror/gore and action anime but when it doesn't have a plot then its rather boring to me. \r\nThe anime as we all know it, is a battle royale between the 12 zodiac warriors. They must all fight to be the last one standing and whoever is left alive wins and gets a wish granted. \r\nCharacters: We got to sort of meet all of the characters at this point. We know what Boar, Dog, Chicken, Monkey, Horse and Rams lives were likeand what they were trying to do. However, when it came to Chicken and Monkey, their stories or at least their mini character arcs weren't really clear or were rather mediocre. It seemed rushed particularly for chicken with the whole her emotional susceptibility; yet shes a cold hearted liar who can deceive anyone. Seeing as it is a battle royale , chances of having a favorite are slim if any character really appeals to anyone. \\n\\n\r\nArt: It's not the greatest but its not the worst either. There are some interesting character design choices...... particularly with Chicken, Monkey, and Tiger. Considering they are going to be in an all out war they are the least dressed for that. Likewise with Rabbit, I'm curious to know why they changed his outfit from the beginning to what he is during the battle. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly I just think the story is not catching my attention because it spends an entire episode giving you backstory and trying to get you to feel bad for some of these characters who weren't exactly good people either. To then get 5 minutes of a bit of action and then the inevitable death of said character. I am skeptical as to how this is going to develop further.",

            "content": "Wanted to kill some time by watching anime people kill each other. It was pretty much that. The art felt really poor at times along with boring pacing that made this short series hard to sit through. \r\nSTORY:\r\n2/10\r\nI like how they never explain why some of them have \u201cpowers\u201d or whatever? I guess it\u2019s the human world but\u2026.not like there\u2019s much story to begin with so it doesn\u2019t really matter. I think this is a take off of Battle Royale or something? If you want to see some edgey anime people fight each other with lots of slow exposition and backstories, then this is foryou.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nGot really lazy and ugly a lot, like the noses were always shifting along with reusing the same character pose/same shots for like 5 minutes of exposition get really noticeable. Not like I could do that but dang, felt cheap and \u201csuper edgy\u201d but poorly done. \\n\r\nThe 3D did actually work for some of the fights rather well which was surprising, but the 3D wasn\u2019t that great so it didn\u2019t help much.\\n\r\nThe colour as a whole felt ugly and dark, maybe that\u2019s for the theme but didn\u2019t help it look any better as a result. \\n\r\nAlso interesting censoring at times that was kinda funny unintentionally. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\n5/10\\n\r\nI\u2019m neutral with this. Never really listened but the bits I heard were fine.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\n2/10\\n\\n\r\nThe pattern seemed to develop of \u201chere\u2019s a character who died/about to die so we\u2019re gonna flesh out their backstory for an episode\u201d and it happened every time I think. Trying to make me care about someone when it\u2019s the same almost every time with a few twists feels cheap. The only character that felt like had somewhat redeeming qualities was the winner with their wish at the end, felt human and had emotion.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nI did want to see the end so I sat through this in 2 days.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR easy enough way to pass some time.  \\n\r\nThe pacing along with sometimes ugly art and animation made it dull and hard to sit through.",

That's hard to really describe. Basically all more or less important characters have some backstory, to which we could refer. Some of it is also a filler for a screentime, but I believe that, depending on the receiver, you might relate to their cause a little bit more or less.\\n\\n\r\nEven though some stories might look futile, I feel like it might have been necessary to ask and answer some questions by itself. Whenever you like it or not, it depends on your personal preferences.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI must say, that I enjoyed quite a lot, even though there were some filler scenes that I skipped or just ignored, the show kept my attention for most of the time. I wasn't really curious about who will win, it was more about the war within and confrontation of the contrasts.\\n\\n\r\nThe further part might contain spoilers, since it refers to the last episodes of the show.\\n\\n\r\nTaking on point my personal experience with it, the final lesson given by the winner shows us the situation with no 'good' way out.\\n",

            "content": "Well well well, after all of this recent chit chat over the new holy grail of existence (Battle Royales), I looked through the list of anime I missed while hibernating in fall 2017 and the only thing that really stood out to me (besides 3-gatsu, of course but that's another story) was Juuni Taisen, an anime in which 12 furries engage in bloody combat for the grand prize of ONE WEESH!! Yes, my blood is pumping like a jackrabbit on a frick frackin tortoise hare if ya ask me! \r\nSeriously though, all of these new battle royale games really aren't that fun. I mean, theyhave a good idea, but the execution just isn't there. UNLIKE Juuni Taisen, of course! Seroosly though, the execution in JT is god-like. The pacing is so well balanced and while everyone seems to be complaining about the backstories in almost eery dernd epis0de, I really liked these backstories, and the blending between the backstories and present fights just worked so well. So what if they predict who dies neckst, because it pretty dern fun watchin' dem backstoris rat?!?\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure you know the basic plot by know, so let's dive into the furries. 12 people played SO MUCH Animal Jam that they transformed into animal people in real life. Seriously, I see so many similarities between this and Mahou Shoujo Isukei Keikaku (bless jesus if I spelled that right)(also I haven't finished that anime as of writing this so don't spoil my eggs). But these 12 furries are really not as cancerous as real life furries. In the words of Keel Mombasa, 2D girls are better than 3D girls, and boi is he right. Obviously among the 12 humanoids, there will be some you like, some you love, and some you wanna shove their ass down their throat and make them eat their underwear. Personally, my favs were rabbit, chicken, and Scooby doo. Lets be real though, nobody gives a shit about boar. She's just such a BOARing character. And the super scaleo brothers were kinda dull as well. Not to mention they wasted 2 episodes of this 12 episode masterpizza so SCREW THEM. \\n\\n\r\nTalkin bout them animashins, howeva, can be a rel dern micks baeg. The animation during the first few episodes is really grrrrrrraet though, but starts to dip as the episodes go on, especially right in the middle. However, it gets back up during the last few episodes and BEATS THE CRAP OUT OF STAIN!!! The animation for Jooney Toisan is Deku, basically. CGI is used for a few fights, but it actually looks pretty good. Its not stiff shit like Ajin (seriously, I need to update my old reviews from my 12 year old self) and while a little unsettling, it actually enhances the dark atmosphere that Edgy Taisedge is tryna give ya. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the derned moosic, its pretty go0d. The opening is honestly one of the most catchy sausages ever, and the ending is a fun piece from Do As Infinity, and the OST, while not necessarily memorable, is fitting from what I remember. Voice actors all do a grrrrrraet job of making them furries more complex, showing whats really under all that hair.\\n\\n\r\nAs sexy as Julyey Teisken has made itself, it does have a few minimal flaws. The one majah thang is the lack of screen time with certain characters, mainly HORSEEE. He was really warming up to be my favorite of the serious (I love tank type of characters), and while I did like that his personality was different from the typical tank warrior, I wish we could have seen him do a little more than run around. Rip, I guess thats what horses do best, but with how interesting his backstory is, its a shame. That's honesly the only thing I really majorly dislexically dislike about JT. \\n\\n\r\nAll I can say is that you should watch Juuni Taisen, no matter what gender, race, or weaboo level you are. Even if you're a typical white football track runner who gives no shits about anime, you shoud still watch it. Its a fun anime that, well, is simply fun and keeps you on the edge of your seat. If you're one of those typical teens who OBSESSES over forknife or something like that, this may be the gateway to anime for you. If you like the idea of 12 furries competing for the holy grail then GET OUT OF MY SIGHT AND GO WATCH FATE/TAISEN\\n\\n\r\n9/10 \\n",

            "content": "Juuni Taisen is not a bad anime.\r\nI wanted to start this show once it finished airing. I mean, a battle royale theme? Different and distinct characters? Survival? Sign me up!\r\nHowever, I got caught up in life and forgot all about it until last weekend but when I checked its page, I found many negative reviews and 3/10 ratings here and there and all over the place.\r\nNaturally, I started it with mixed feelings. I will be lying if I said I didn't think it was crap from the first two episodes. \r\nHowever, once I finished the third and fourth episode, I started to re-evaluate my opinion.Was that opinion in the beginning really mine? I couldn't judge just yet.\\n\\n\r\nAs the series went on, I realized that my thoughts on the beginning were affected by the reviews I have read and a sudden realization hit me: \"Hey! This anime isn't bad at all!\"\\n\\n\r\nMy overall rating of it is 6, which is above the average. \\n\\n\r\nI tried to understand why people have been quick to bash it, and I came to a few conclusions: \\n\\n\r\n1- The very short fight scenes: \\n\r\nIf you go on wishing for very long, epic, fight scenes, you will just be disappointed. This is not Dragon Ball or One Piece, where the fights stretch off for weeks. In Juuni Taisen, a fight will end within 3 seconds. But I grew to love this aspect because it took me off guard and the creators just found a different 'killing' way each time that I wasn't expecting.\\n\\n\r\n2-The 'flashbacks': \\n\r\nSixty (sometimes forty) percent of the episodes are background stories of the characters. I loved them because it made me feel sympathy for them and get to know them. If there wasn't any background story, how would we know of them? We would end up just watching twelve strangers fight.\\n\\n\r\nJuuni Taisen was a very entertaining show. It mixed elements of thriller, paranormal, survival, drama and in my opinion succeeded in giving a fun anime to enjoy.\\n\r\nI loved the introductions of each character before each fight. I loved their individuality. \\n\r\nWhat lowered my rating would have to be the story. If there was more of a plot explored in depth, my rating would have been a solid eight. The concept of twelve countries fighting against each other, each one with a warrior that represented it, seemed to lack a lot. What is the cause of this conflict? Who are the people that bet on the winner? Why? What happens to the countries that lost their warriors? \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this was a decent show that I enjoyed very much. I would definitely recommend it for a change of pace in the survival genre. Oh! I LOVED THE OP!  \\n",

            "content": "Juni Taisen is the story of a proxy war, set up by mysterious people to bet on the winner! Supposedly it's pretty high stakes with even countries possibly being on the line. The proxy war is being fought by people who represent the twelve animals of the Chinese Zodiac. Think Fruits Basket, but a fighting anime.\r\nThe way this story is told, we're not really following it from one certain point of view, so there is no real main character. As the viewer you're more so expected to pick a person to root for and hope they win I suppose. As it goes along we seepeople get cut down. Death can be pretty sudden! Which is a nice change of pace at times, when you watch a lot of fighting anime you know how people can seem to be able to survive most anything.  Basically this is a story about fighting, for fighting.\\n\\n\r\nTaste: The show has a decent taste, but I think it really needed some more seasoning. What I mean by that is that they don't really go off the, at least from my point of view, the obvious path. The winner seemed obvious and there was never a reason for me to doubt it. They had a few ways they could have tried to have thrown me off the scent, but they didn't really seem to try. \\n\\n\r\nAnother issue is in how the story is presented, and what I mean by that is that we have no real main character to follow. If the person who I wanted to win died off early. I lack much in the way of incentive to keep watching, apart from just the nifty battles. Sadly those also didn't do much for me, we lacked a real tense fight, and even the final confrontation was a bit lack luster. If you're going to give me a show about fighting to the death. Give me some intensity!\\n\\n\r\nStill, I did make it to the end, and there were some interesting characters. I suppose I wish that we could have followed one of them, or that one of them pulled out in the end. Instead we got a meh winner, and a meh finale, so it really dragged it down. Taste gets a 5 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nPresentation: We had some good animation here. I thought we were lacking in the gore department, but that's just me wanting a bit more spice to the show. The opening to the show was cool and the characters had some neat looks. Man the rabbit, so daring! They didn't have anything that really stood out to me in the art or music area, but they also didn't slack off. 2.5 out of 5 here\\n\\n\r\nOriginality: When I saw this show, I was brought to thinking about the Fate series. Buncha people get to together, and the winner gets any wish they want granted. You don't see this sort of thing all that much in other shows, and how it was presented was also pretty original if you ask me. Some of the people also had some pretty neat abilities that you don't often get to see. I wish they could have shown off more! 3.5 out of 5\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion I'd say this is a show to watch if you wanna see some people fighting for no real reason. I'd probably watch it again, but I'd more likely just make silly comments as I do. I think the show starts off really well, but dies off as it loses steam. 11 out of 20!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

So what if you may guess who is gonna die in the episode? So what if you can guess who is going to win? Is that really that big of a deal? But I really doubt there is a single person who could say HOW the person was going to win. That was not predictable at all, it was greatly made and it all just made sense in the end, not beforehands. So yeah, you may find yourself asking why this one had to die like that, or why does that one win, but the end makes you say, \"ah\", because everything just HAD to happen that way and that makes it wonderful... that there was a really good reason why did everything happen the way it happened. So even if you hate that your favorite chars died, or how they died, in the end, at least in my case, I was like \"oh okay\" and the bitterness fades away, because it just makes sense. And thats one of the reasons why I like this anime so much, because only few anime have that.\\n\\n\r\nEven tho Im a fan of Fate/Zero, I don't like the others like Fate/Stay night etc, and Juuni Taisen has what I liked about Zero. There's action, there's blood, there's story, there's different and likeable characters, there's no room for teenagers and their drama - and especially there is a simple ending - one winner, and not just like any other anime that just ends whatsoever. Simply its one of the good ones. Sure, everyone has their own opinion, but don't be stupid and let the haters ruin the anime for you when you haven't even watched it yet, make your own opinion and reasons why you hate or like it. Give yourself a chance to watch it without being influenced.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I disliked about this anime was that every character had their background explored but one. And I kinda hated the 9th episode, haha (especially the animation, since the whole anime had this really cool animation, but then in that one episode it was like playing some game, it was really disappointing, but it eventually got better again, so yay)\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, I like the story, I love the characters, in the most episodes I loved the art, the music wasn't that memorable tho but I enjoyed the whole anime to the fullest.",

            "content": "English Versi\u00f3n:\r\nJuuni taisen is the latest adaptation of a novel by the famous NisiOisin (Monogatari Series) and is the most disappointing thing I've seen from this author.\r\nSincerely Juuni taisen is a battle royal like any other: stupid, without context, silly and extravagant action but with the difference that he discards the common narratives for a very little sight and that makes it bad and tedious.\r\nThe episodes of Juuni Taisen follow with clear guidelines such as:\r\n> Presentation.\r\n> Introspection.\r\n> Death.\r\nDuring the 12 episodes we are presented to each participant in the same way and this worked the first episode because it grabs us on guard and keepsus expectant but being a constant loses the \"hook\" and only ends up making it tedious. It is true that there are animes like Kino's journey or mushishi that repeat their way to tell their stories but those anime are not style / substance and follow that pattern to continue showing aspects related to the human being instead in the case of shows like Juuni Taisen is necessary keep the listener hooked adding that for the second half we can only see how each person falls one by one in ridiculous ways and ends up killing all the desire to continue.\\n\\n\r\nAnother important point is the large number of characters that try to manage and in a way it does well because they all have well defined features and have some degree of charisma but do not have enough time or dialogue to note that charisma, another error is that At the time of doing the proper introspections, the series takes on a too serious tone that does not fit with what the series tries to be besides being sincere, none of these is as versatile as they are the Monogatari or Katanagatari and all based on a group of lunatics and grace is lost (Baccano! and Durarara! They also had crazy characters but they had more characteristics than being just crazy)\\n\r\nFinally, the productive values \u200b\u200bat the beginning are quite good considering that the study is relatively new but from chapter 6 the kinesics fails, the designs are constantly deformed but that if the funds are ok.\\n\r\nThe direction is usually regular pulling bad and the soundtrack although it is not bad does not have any subject that is recognizable and ends up being ignored.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion juuni Taisen is a bad show and any other work of nisio deserves more attention than this.\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------------------\\n\r\nVersi\u00f3n en espa\u00f1ol:\\n\\n\r\nJuuni taisen es la m\u00e1s reciente adaptaci\u00f3n de una novela del famoso NisiOisin (Monogatari Series) y es de lo m\u00e1s decepcionante que he visto de este autor. \\n\r\nSinceramente Juuni taisen es un battle royal como cualquier otro: est\u00fapido, sin contexto, acci\u00f3n tonta y extravagante pero con la diferencia de que desecha las narrativas comunes por una muy poco vista y eso mismo la hace mala y tediosa.\\n\r\nLos episodios de Juuni Taisen siguen con unas pautas claras como por ejemplo:\\n\r\n>Presentaci\u00f3n.\\n\r\n>Introspecci\u00f3n.\\n\r\n>Muerte.\\n\r\nDurante los 12 episodios se nos va presentando a cada participante de la misma forma y esto funcionaba al primer episodio porque nos agarra en guardia baja y nos mantiene expectantes pero al ser una constante pierde el \"enganche\" y s\u00f3lo termina volviendolo tedioso. Es cierto que hay animes como Kino's journey o mushishi que repiten su forma para contar sus historias pero esos anime no son estilo/sustancia y siguen ese patr\u00f3n para seguir mostrando aspectos relacionados al ser humano en cambio en el caso de shows como Juuni Taisen es necesario mantener enganchado al espetador sumandole que para la segunda mitad s\u00f3lo nos queda ver como cada persona cae uno por uno de formas rid\u00edculas y termina matando todas las ganas de querer continuar.\\n\\n\r\nOtro punto importante es la gran cantidad de personajes que intenta manejar y en cierto modo lo hace bien pues todos tienen rasgos bien definidos y tienen cierto grado de carisma pero no tienen el tiempo suficiente ni los di\u00e1logos para hacer notar ese carisma, otro error es que al momento de hacer las debidas introspecciones la serie adquiere un tono demasiado serio que no encuadra con lo que la serie intenta ser adem\u00e1s que siendo sinceros, ninguno de estos es tan vers\u00e1til como lo son los de Monogatari o Katanagatari y al todos basarse en un grupo de lun\u00e1ticos ya se pierde la gracia (Baccano! y Durarara!! tambien tenian personajes locos pero tenian m\u00e1s caracter\u00edsticasque ser simplemente locos)\\n\r\nPor ultimo, los valores productivos al principio estan bastante bien considerando que el estudio es relativamente novato pero a partir del capitulo 6 la kinesica falla, los dise\u00f1os se deforman constantemente pero eso si, los fondos estan okey.\\n\r\nLa direccion es en general regular tirando a mala y el soundtrack si bien no es malo no tiene ningun tema que sea reconocible y termina siendo ignorado.\\n\\n\r\nEn conclusion juuni Taisen es un mal show y cualquier otra obra de nisio merece m\u00e1s atencion que esta.",

What originally attracted me to it was it reminded me of the Hunger Games. 12 Zodiac houses send someone to fight for them to keep peace. One person is the winner and they get one wish. If you are looking for a good story and good plot, you won\u2019t find it here. There wasn\u2019t a lot of explanation why these houses are fighting each other. What stood out about this anime was the characters. Each episode we get backstory on most of the competitors. It gave a very human perspective on why each person wasfighting. And depending on the character, it was sad when they died. This is a story about 12 people, for one reason or another, have been entered in the Juni Taisen to fight for something; some for honor, some for glory, to make a difference, and to see a face important to them. \\n",

If you're looking for a short action show to binge or drop in on from time to time you could do worse. \r\nThe Long: \r\nWhen I started watching Juuni Taisen (JT), I wasn't really that into it. I figured I'd be dropping it in a couple of episodes, but each of the first few were just interesting enough to make me come back for the next one. About half way in I found myself legitimately invested in several of the characters, and legitimatelylooking forward to the next episode; eventually I just binged the last there and, well, that's where it fell apart; specifically the last episode. The whole show builds up to this big wish; any Fate/fans out there know exactly where it's going, except this time someone actually gets to make a wish. However, the wish it's self is the issue, it's disappointing; as if the writer didn't really have a plan, and that is not an accusation I raise lightly. Alternatively, it may be that they thought they were being clever, but unfortunately it wasn't. If you go in knowing that the ending is distinctly disappointing, you may still enjoy the characters and animation, but if you're looking for a gratifying conclusion you'll be sourly disappointed.",

It's kinda fast paced and short which makes it a good watch for people who prefer anime that aren't long running. It's a little predictable when it comes to who wins the Juni Taisen but how it happens makes it a bit more interesting. Also, I like how it covered the backstories of the characters. I recall someone saying that the character development they get is wasted since, you know, it's a death game and these characters die. Idon't agree with this at all. Getting to know these characters is what makes us like them in the first place. Anyway...there's one issue. It doesn't really effect the anime but it would've been nice to know the backstory of Rabbit. I do like how we get to know more about certain characters even after they die though.\\n\\n\r\nThe art's also nice and the same goes for the animation...most of the time. The CGI (I think) that they used in the opening looks cool as heck. But, in a certain episode, the animation got kinda weird looking at times and the art definitely could've been better. After that, everything was good though.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is great. The opening had an interesting feel to it but, in my opinion, the ending song was way better. Whenever they used emotional or dramatic music, everything was good. Nothing felt out of place or oddly timed.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were very good. Most of them were developed and had personalities. You could actually like some of these characters and find others interesting. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Juni Taisen was a great watch and I don't regret a second of it.

            "content": "Okay, I will say it in the beginning just to get it over with: The fact that the anime is predictable is just one of many problems. I've seen a lot of fans get angry when people say it's predictable, so I just wanted to get that out there. Pleased? Okay, moving on. \r\nJuuni Taisen is a trainwreck. It started out so promising, but slowly sank into the ranks of meh. It's probably the most underwhelming anime I've ever seen. That said, there were good things about it. Sadly the bad things were just too glaring and I just got very bored. The only reasonI finished it was because I wanted to see if it managed to redeem itself, but sadly it never happened. \\n\\n\r\nAs I said, there are some good things about this anime. The artstyle looks pretty good. A lot of dark shadows and cool costumes helped set a certain atmosphere. There were also some decent characters among all the bland ones, especially Monkey. The OP and ED were also pretty good. The best thing about the anime though is the potential. Since there was no main character I thought that would mean that anyone could die at any moment and that made me feel hyped. Finally, a battle royal without a set winner! And then I realized the set order of deaths (this isn't a spoiler, it's very obvious). \\n\\n\r\nSadly all the potential this anime had got quickly flushed away when I noticed the set deaths and the way every episode was structured. If the anime wanted to be predictable on purpose for some effect, it failed. \\n\r\nThis anime has a lot of talking and inner thoughts. Too much actually. There are so few silent moments it gave me a headache. Everything in this anime is explained and repeated to the smallest detail. Every observation is either said out loud or we hear the thoughts of someone explaining it. This anime does not trust its viewers to see or figure out anything by themselves, which made me feel like the anime thought I was a toddler. That is especially insulting when the anime seems to want to be mysterious. \\n\\n\r\nAs everyone has mentioned before me, the animation quality very quickly dropped. A lot of repeated scenes, scenes where everyone stands still and even when they try to up it with something cool it only lasts for a second. Especially the action. I've seen people say that the action is \"non-stop and blood-pumping\", which I don't really understand since the action in each action-scene lasts for maybe a few seconds with a lot of long talks or thoughts in between. And every death happens way too quickly. Was this to save on the animation budget or on purpose? I don't know, but it was very disappointing nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nThough some of the character backgrounds were a little interesting, many of them were also pretty standard. It was also hard to focus on them since every time we saw a flashback it was like the anime was raising a death flag for the character, which made it very hard to care. \\n\\n\r\nIf I was to find one word to describe this anime it would be underwhelming. Almost every aspect was lacking in one way or the other. It's so disappointing since I truly wanted the anime to be good! Sadly, all the way until the end, it was boring and lacking. Still, I can see why some people like it. For me though, the bad outweighed the good by too much. \\n\\n\r\n+Artstyle/costume design\\n\r\n+Some of the characters were interesting\\n\r\n+Potential\\n\r\n+Good OP and ED\\n\\n\r\n-Animation drop\\n\r\n-Predictable\\n\r\n-Repeating episode structure\\n\r\n-Too much explaining\\n\r\n-Actionscenes were too short\\n\r\n-Many standard character backgrounds\\n\r\n-Disappointing\\n\r\n-Wasted potential\\n\\n\r\nDespite all that I've said, this anime is not terrible. It has some aspects that make it so I understand why people like it, but sadly it's just way too underwhelming and lacking. It could've been great, but ended up being meh.",

But i'm getting ahead of myself here, let us start from the begining.\r\nThe Juuni Taisen is a great competition of sorts that happens once every few years between various selected members of the twelvezodiacal houses.\\n\r\nThe objective is for them to fight to the death while the rich folk watching from a fair distance bet on who they believe will emerge victorious.\\n\r\nWhat is the purpose of this? Well, that would ruin the surprise, but let's just say that there's a much larger picture here to which the participants remain oblivious throughout the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, they grant a wish to whoever happens to win. This is supposed to be important, but no one seems to talk about it until the very last episode, which is kind of a boomer.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, even if i did spoil it, there isn't THAT much to explain because the show doesn't experiment too much with that idea, something i think they could've handled much better.\\n\\n\r\nWhere this show truly shines is in it's characters. While not all of them got proper development, the ones who did, exceeded all expectations. They felt like real people, and i wished the series was longer all just so the characters that didn't get much time in the spotlight had some extra minutes of screen time.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design is just gorgeous, i want a poster with each and every one of the participants, like holy waffles.\\n\r\nRemember how Shirobako portrayed how hard it was to nail original character design? Well, this show makes it look like child's play, kudos to whoever drew that.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was ok, they showed what all the participants... Well, what MOST participants had to go through, and it felt really believable. This has a bad side however. Most of the time you could tell exactly who was going to die and in what order because the anime had the bad habit of showing their backstory right before they're killed off.\\n\\n\r\nEven the ending sequence tells you the order in which they die... And yes, the chinese zodiac does too, so stay away from those if you don't want any spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is... There.\\n\r\nI mean, i can apreciate it, it was gorgeous when played in the show, but it was forgettable nonetheless. I can't seem to remember much about it... Except for the OP and ED, those are a masterpiece in their own right.\\n\r\nOn their own they're nothing special, but when played alongside the show... It just works!\\n\\n\r\nThe low point of the anime is the animation of course, which is rough around the edges to say the least, and at times can be really inconsistent.\\n\r\nIt's serviceable, but you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who enthusiastically likes it.\\n\r\nHad the animation been better, this show could've been an 8.5... Then again, MAL scores aren't on a spectrum, so i guess that wouldn't change much. But still, something in the style of Hellsing would've worked perfectly, in fact, they kind of do that in some of the later episodes (I did say the art was inconsistent).\\n\\n\r\nAnd now on to what changed my mind from giving the show a 7 to a solid 8: The ending.\\n\\n\r\nWhat an ending.\\n\\n\r\nI obviously can't spoil much, but the ending explores some very deep themes about the responsability of having your wish granted, its consequences, and how to use such wish efficiently.\\n\r\nIf the show had explored these themes more, it would've easily been a 9, maybe even higher.\\n\\n\r\nTo some, the ending alone isn't enough to recomend an anime, but to me, this ending is proof of how much heart and soul were poured into this anime, and that's more than enough reason for me to tell you to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nIt's only 12 episodes, so i definitely recomend it. After all, you lose nothing, and when it comes to this genre, you can do much, much worse.\\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 8.",

For an anime that is just classified as action the action was very lack luster and left a lot to be desired. All deaths were pretty much one shots and the fights between the zodiac signs lasted 2-3 mins tops. Now you have 12 characters that need to be killed off with 12 episodes so I understand this decision but it doesn't make it a good decision. Also the animation during the fights was also very underwhelming when this is supposed to be the biggest draw to your series and withthe fights only last 2-3 mins not like there is much of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe saving grace that made this series average and watchable for me was the characters backstory and intentions (which there was only little of but when it was there it was a very nice touch) \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw however was revealing the order of character deaths within the first episodes. I actually couldn't believe any anime would do such a  stupid thing as it took all the suspense away and the ending left a lot to be desired.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it wasn't terrible but it was not good. So a 5 is my fair score for it.",

            "content": "Now this is what the Twelve Zodiacs is suppose to be! \r\nI've always felt the the Twelve Zodiacs in Hunter X Hunter was overrated and far too tame. Unlike the other characters in the series like the Zoldycks, the Phantom Troupe, Chimera Ants or the Chairman, they never showed us any of their skills in battle, their awesomeness or why they even deserved to be Netero's successors. They never lived up to their premise as the strongest hunters and all they did was bicker like children over the Chairman's position.\r\nNow imagine someone else had the same idea, took that concept and did a total reimaginingof the characters. With the same style and execution of Hunter X Hunter, with the same kind of deadly power battles and retaining the same cleverness and philosophy that runs concurrent to the series. This, my friends, is what you'd get with Juuni Taisen.\\n\\n\r\nTwelve Zodiac warriors, coming together every twelve years in a battle to the death to determine the best of their number. With the reward of having their most desired wish granted, the participants will pull out all stops, to fight, to survive, and win. It's a simple concept and one that Juuni Taisen have executed with style.\\n\\n\r\nThe battles are wildly entertaining, you never know what's going to happen. Its like whenever think you think everything's gonna be ok, something comes along and unexpected things happen.\\n\r\nThe enemies are clever. They play mind games. They're over the top and do tons of crazy stuff. It's such a thrill to watch because often, in many animes, especially shounen types, you pretty much know how a fight is going to turn out before it even begins. But this? No way. I've never seen protags gets off'ed in such unexpected ways. lol.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was superb and very well suited to the show. I especially liked the OP with the badass shadowed frames, almost like a homage to the Madhouse series.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, they are definitely a varied bunch in this series. Love'em or hate'em but you've got to admit they're unique. They just ooze personality. And I think that's part of the charm. It's such a wild clash of egos and character types. In keeping with the Zodiac theme, it's almost like an experiment of what would happen if you threw a bunch of wild animals like tigers, rabbits, snakes, etc into a room together. Only they're not normal animals but are equipped with machine guns, explosives and super powers! \\n\\n\r\nYet beneath all that chaotic fighting, the story still goes into enough depth of the background of each character that you still find yourself rooting for them as time goes by. Some of their philosophies may be flawed, yet it also shows they're human. With all the contradictions therein. It's a nice touch that speaks to the quality of writing.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion I believe this is one hell of an underrated gem that has flown under the radar. It's so good that I wish they should straight up replace the whole HxH chairman election arc with Juuni Taisen! Then it'll be the perfect series ^^!\\n\\n\r\n(BTW don't read too much into negative reviews, like SAO it's just unfairly targeted by hater trolls on this site.)\\n\\n",

The story progresses quite quickly and tries to focus on characters in between battle sequences. \r\nArt: The art style is beautiful and I love how fluidly the characters move. \r\nSound: I had no qualms about the sound. The soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous! It's strange but it is just right. Kind of reminds meof the opening song of Paranoia Agent.

Predictable outcomes\r\n3. Boring characters, except two who I'll be mentioning below\r\n\r\n\"Juuni Taisen\" or \"Zodiac Wars\" is a double edged sword for me. I don't know if I like it or dislike it, mainly because there are episodes where the anime stood out and there are also episodes which, to me, are boring AF.\r\nNow let me clarify first that I like Battle Royale anime. You can see it from my rating of the last Battle Royale-esque anime last year \"Magical Girl Raising Project\". Ilove that series. When I found out about Juuni Taisen I was seriously hyped for it. \\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the first three episodes, it didn't impress me a single bit. It's just characters boasting about how powerful they are and getting killed off easily. To me, I hate that kind of development. I hate seeing characters who seemed strong getting killed off in one shot. I'd consider that lazy writing. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, after episode 3, I started to enjoy this series more. It didn't go down the route of killing one character per episode and I thank the series for that. But that doesn't change the fact that the character backstories told were pretty much the same and boring. I like MGRP because every character has a tragedic backstory to make me sympathize with them. However in this series, characters backstory often show how strong the particular character is, and I don't like it that much. What's the point of showing the power level of a character if he is going to die sooner or later. The only episode that stood out to me was episode 10, when the backstory of Tiger and Ox was shown, that is how this anime should be like, THAT IS HOW YOU WRITE A GOOD BATTLE ROYALE anime! Cannot believe I need to sit through 10 episodes of mediocrity to see one which actually impressed me. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also pretty one dimensional. I don't feel any depth in them. Although their backstory were told and I totally appreciate it, but the fact still remained the same in which every character are who they are at first glance, except the two I mentioned earlier. It made me feel nothing about their death and that is sad because a battle royale anime needs to be impactful. \\n\\n\r\nWell I don't blame this anime for being predictable. After all this is based off of the Chinese Zodiac race. So I just want to be more invested in the characters. But each character had almost the same backstory making me feel a bit bored while watching it, especially the story about the dragon and the snake. But I still appreciate that the show actually told us who the character are to let us learn more about them. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is pretty consistent. I like the use of CG in this series. The action scenes were well animated and I love it. If only this anime had more of those scenes other than characters talking non-stop about their tactics and telling you how strong they are, then I would love this series more. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is upbeat. I love it. I love the OP theme and the ED theme. Background musics, although didn't stood out to me, but were still well placed making the action scenes more impactful. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, as a fan of Battle Royale anime myself, I won't give this anime a shit rating, it's a fair enough/above average anime. I do find myself enjoying this. But whether or not to recommend this, I'd say watch it if you like battle royale anime like Fate. If you hate it, then skip this. It's not for you. That's it. 6/10 Thanks for reading.",

I know, this is the exact antithesis of what it's advertised to be, but taken at face value it has major issues holding it back, chief among them being a majority of screen-time being taken up by past events, plot holes galore, very obvious death-flags, not enough actual battle to even fill a kiddie pool, very off-puttingtransitions between 2D and 3D animation, and a terrible ending with zero payoff. I won't even count the fact that the entire death order is evident to anyone that pays attention. \\n\\n\r\nNo, if you want to actually enjoy this show, you have to go in expecting twelve short stories about characters that just *happen* to be fighting to the death. If Juni Taisen has any particular strength, it's in the characters. While not particularly exceptional, most of the fighters have interesting designs and backstories, and while condensed to an episode each their flashbacks convey their character well.\\n\\n\r\n I get the feeling this is more the direction the studio was trying to go for, since each episode was very heavily focused on one character with each getting their own turn. To be honest, I may have preferred twelve completely standalone stories based on these characters, but this is what we have, and I can't willfully recommend a show based on the merits of half, when the other half is so woefully underdeveloped.",

There's a lot of backstories, even the first episode is mostly just world building and backstory.\r\nHonestly, the only reason I'm writing this, is because someone had to tell me this exists.  For those that call this story predictable... it is.  Because it's the retelling of something.  In the 10th episode, one character makes a reference to a specific something.  I cannot give spoilers here,but if you pm me I can explain if you would like.  The reference, is what Juuni Taisen is a retelling of, just in a different setting.\\n\\n\r\nMy only real problem, is I told myself midway if I did not like the winner, I would not like the show.

            "content": "I\u2019m gonna go out on a limb here and say I liked it. Quite a lot too. Sure, it was predictable at times, and sure, the quality of the animation took a huge nosedive about halfway through, but I really don\u2019t think it deserves all the hate I\u2019ve been seeing it get lately.\r\nFirst off: the story. It\u2019s true that from about episode 3 you can tell who\u2019s going to die based on how the anime works. But that doesn\u2019t actually take away from the enjoyment. It\u2019s just like having a friend tell you a major spoiler for a series \u2013 the surprise might be gone,but sometimes you enjoy it all the more for that. (The only difference here is that the anime spoilers itself.) I personally didn\u2019t mind knowing who was going to die, it just meant I knew who to focus on when watching an episode. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development was basically episodic. One episode per character (although there were exceptions). I thought Tiger\u2019s story was great \u2013 that was probably my favourite part of the anime. Most of the backstories were interesting (with the exception of Snake and Dragon, or at least that\u2019s my opinion), and the characters were just quirky enough that I enjoyed watching them without getting bored. That\u2019s actually one thing that can be a con for an anime, but in this case was a pro; the amount of time spent on each character was manageable - bite sized pieces, if you will.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending, whilst not necessarily a brilliant one, was nevertheless a fitting send-off for the show. The anime did take a rather different approach during the last episode \u2013 much more philosophical \u2013 but it addressed the question raised at the beginning. I thought the way the wish (the overall point to the story) was handled was very thought-provoking, and even though I didn\u2019t necessarily agree with the wish itself, it was very human. That humanity is something that the anime needed after the Taisen bloodbath. It gave the show\u2026closure, you might call it. There were some plot-holes, and some questions that remained unanswered, but in relation to those I don\u2019t think answers were actually needed.\\n\\n\r\nThere were a lot of fabulous fight scenes (at least in the first half), and some pretty good music too.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was faithful to its Battle Royale/Hunger Games trope, and even though there are parts of it that I feel could have been handled better, I respect it for that. Most of the episodes did leave me wanting more, after all. (In regard to parts that could have been handled better\u2026I\u2019d say the Dragon and Snake siblings, and basically everything to do with Rabbit. My main bugbear; there was so much potential\u2026)\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, if you like the survival horror trope, and like seeing a mix of interesting characters (but don\u2019t mind if there\u2019s not much plot), I\u2019d recommend you check out Juuni Taisen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy watching!

            "content": "The premise of a battle royale anime where the winner can get any wish he desires isn\u2019t anything new or original; this series adds the twist of relating the characters with the Chinese zodiac and giving them special abilities. The premise and concept of this show is actually good and interesting, the series itself however is something entirely different.\r\nThe show starts off great with a good first impression. If they were able to keep the quality of animation and story-writing that was in the first episode, this series wouldn\u2019t have such a low rating. \r\nEach episode usually focuses on a character and his/her backstory beforejoining the tournament. This gave a better impression of the characters to the viewers and adds more depth to the series. Doing this in a 12 episode series however is very difficult which is probably why the characters in the latter half of the show barely had any dedicated episodes or backstory given to them. This hurt the show because the characters who the viewers know about, or can relate to were killed off in the series and the characters left didn\u2019t have anything to make viewers more excited to watch. This is clear especially with the winner of the Juuni Taisen, who had the least impact throughout the show and had little to no backstory with the most overpowered ability.\\n\\n\r\nThe show tried to aim for a story without a clear protagonist or antagonist and focus on character development by animating each character\u2019s individual stories. Unfortunately because the series was constrained to 12 episodes, they were only able to animate this for the characters who died early on in the series and left the ending feeling like it was rushed. The ending was rushed, but only because the series was poorly planned.\\n\\n\r\nNote: The CG animation in this show is also one of the worst cases I\u2019ve seen. Luckily it\u2019s mostly present only in a few fight scenes toward the end of the show but it\u2019s still really bad.",

            "content": "May Contain Slight Spoilers\r\nNormally a show like Juuni Taisen would get quite a low score from me. From very early on you could figure out the order the battle royale was going for, and even if you couldn\u2019t there were plenty of other hints to let you know who would die and who would be the winner. However, I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to hate it. What saved the show from going below 5/10 were the characters. I, like many others, love a good villain, and a show that has such a variety of messed up individuals was able to slightly make up for thelacklustre action and deaths.\\n\\n\r\nFor any show to work, it needs interesting characters. For all that Juuni Taisen did poorly, the characters it created were pretty great. Each one is a warrior, doing jobs that no one else could with the lost lives of thousands in their resumes. Of course, not everyone goes about this the same way, and it creates a cast that you want to get invested in even though they'll probably die. You get a deceitful Robin Hood that causes both the rich and poor to suffer, a beast-like soldier that drowns their PTSD in alcohol and blood, and a master manipulator with some special eyes in the sky, just to name a few. Almost every character felt unique in the way they act upon and view their surroundings, making it quite a grim experience as you watch all their planning go to ruin. Even some of the abilities were able to capture my curiosity as I watched them either raise an army of the dead, create poisons and bombs as their weapons or just simply rip people to shreds in a variety of different ways.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, for as much as I enjoyed the characters, the rest of the show just didn't quite hit the mark. For an action show, the fights were so lacklustre. You rarely got to see them battle it out and when they did it felt pretty messy with it either jumping from scene to scene way too much or using off looking CG animation for the characters. To be perfectly honest, the backstories of each character showing them outside of the Juuni Taisen was much more fun to watch than the actual show. They were a perfect representation of how fucked up war is and how it affects people differently, even the ones that you\u2019d think are used to the everyday slaughter. Grief, joy, trauma, ecstasy, and a plethora of other emotions can be found across the cast as they continued their awful ways of living. The only characters that I wasn't too fond of in terms of personality and backstory were Dog (an assassin who specialises in poison) and Horse, (a science experiment soldier afraid of losing) as they felt a bit shallow compared to the rest of our cast, but ignoring them the show really nailed its flashbacks.\\n\\n\r\nSo, you\u2019re probably asking how exactly does a show about killing each other work if there isn\u2019t much action, and sadly it just doesn\u2019t. Most of the deaths are too quick and lack impact, with only a few occasional ones that are given enough time to give a little more depth to the characters in their final moments. I get that the show is trying to say that if these people make even just one simple mistake, they could die on the battlefield as quickly as snapping your fingers, but watching such nice characters get such swift ends is just not as enjoyable as it could have been.\\n\\n\r\nI really wanted Juuni Taisen to be amazing, but it just couldn\u2019t reach the expectations I had for it. It was still an enjoyable show, but it could have been so much better if it hadn\u2019t been a battle royale. Give me a spin-off series where it\u2019s just the characters on the battlefield instead of the arena where we watch them do what they do best, and I\u2019ll fall in love. For what I have right now\u2026 I\u2019m a little disappointed knowing that recommending it to others will probably just add to the number of people that hate it.",

Let's get non-spoiler part of review out first: \r\nIt's not worth it, there's some cool animations and fight scenes, sure, but there's even more poorly written \"character background\" which I recommend to just skip with 5 second intervals and I'm pretty sure you'll get everything you needed. Tbh you should just skip the whole show and look up gifs and videos/amvs from this, there's nothing else valuable here, just super-badly-written-overly-edgy-fate/taisen.\r\nNow, SPOILER part: \r\nOk, it started out pretty well with that Boar lady, and backstory was one of the better ones,so I could easily get into the show, and visuals/fights surely made it worthwhile, but after first episode it was all downhill. It's not like I hated everything, where else can you see \"mostly-naked-necromancer-bunny-on-heels vs monkey with a THICC ass\" fight?! Ox stabbing chicken in the face was so well made scene as well. And episode 11? Brilliant. I had high hopes for the last episodes after that! Just to be backstabed by show like the rest of the cast. \\n\\n\r\nNormally, I'd rate Enjoyment part of the show a lot higher in a case like this, but story was so badly written and some of the characters so bad, it sucked most of it out. Character backstory just before they die - I'm sick of this already god damn it, is this so hard to learn that it doesn't work that way? Character isn't more likeable because it has more lore, it doesn't give their death any weight at all either. One of the most likeable characters in this show imo was that Bunny dude, and look at how much backstory he has - none. Does he need? No. Did others need? Some - maybe, but only if 12th episode doesn't fuck up and just throws everything under water. Show gave us 0 conclusions, and it's a pure form of frustration of finally getting to the good part - just to be denied. It's the laziest and most pretentious of all writings to just act like it was a wise thing to do when it in fact was a very poorly put dot on a story writer had not skill to pull of in the first place. \\n\r\n....\\n\r\nwait I just looked it up and the author is Nisio Isin? Wait wha... Jesus. Please don't let this man get near to anything other than monogatari stuff. I love monogatari too much to go on shit-talk about him more, so I'm just gonna assume he put himself in a corner where he had no good way to finish story and just ended it as quickly as he could.",

            "content": "TL;DR: If the ending of a show is more important to you than its other aspects, then watch Juuni Taisen. Otherwise, skip it.\r\nJuuni Taisen (JT) is a battle royale anime in which 12 participants, each representing one of the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac calendar, battle it out for the sake of having one wish granted. JT tries to do away some of the \u2018fluff\u2019 that other battle royale anime (such as Fate Zero, for example) have and the entirety of JT, except for flashbacks, takes place over the course of one night. That being said, while JT does provide some novelty, parts ofit are mired in bad writing, abysmally inconsistent visual quality, and pacing that is all over the place. Some of these aspects are somewhat tempered by a redeeming final episode. I\u2019m not going to compare it with anime like Fate Zero because JT is an entirely different beast.\\n\\n\r\nLet's focus first on the few things this anime does well: This anime is good at initially subverting expectations. In other words, it initially goes against the viewers' expectations about what will happen, which makes for a few entertaining \"did they really just do that\" moments. It also captures the battle royale aspect better than other related anime, there is no clear protagonist until the end. Almost no character has plot armor, and the times plot armor is used, it is justified in the story. The final episode is also a surprisingly good conclusion to this story and adds many of the elements that were missing up to that point. The final episode is decent enough for me to increase JT\u2019s rating from a 4 to a 5.\\n\\n\r\nNow moving on to what it does badly: Everything else. Lets start from the worst. The anime sucks at foreshadowing. It makes everything too obvious. The moderately savvy anime viewer can figure out the big \u2018plot twist\u2019 from the very start. Most anime viewers can very easily figure out the order of the deaths very early on, and also figure out who has the plot armor. Sure, this was intended, but that doesn\u2019t make it any better.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the anime is good at initially subverting viewer expectations, this gimmick becomes old quite fast. Not only can you expect JT to try to surprise you, after the first few episodes you can also guess with reasonable accuracy as to how it will try to surprise you. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the pacing, JT gives almost each character a backstory in the form of flashbacks. The flashbacks are not enough to flesh out a lot of the characters, which I don\u2019t actually mind, since considering the 12 episode length, it is unreasonable to expect JT to fully develop each of the 12 characters. The flashbacks are a problem because they really mess with the pacing of the show. Some flashbacks are very short. Some take up whole episodes. Like many anime with a cast of characters this large, some characters receive decent characterization and some receive very little. Most of the characters in JT fall in the latter category, and even when some characters do receive characterization, it isn\u2019t always very good. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing and narrative suffer from issues that are independent of the flashbacks as well. A built up final confrontation is ended through a contrivance, leading to a very anti-climatic end to the tournament. It also has several plot holes regarding that confrontation, and inconsistencies regarding a very crucial character's powers. \\n\\n\r\nJT also has issues with world building, it isn\u2019t able to decide on how it wants to incorporate supernatural elements in its narrative and in its characters. In this tournament you have characters with shitty powers like not needing to reload a gun, characters with no powers, characters with useful powers like being able to fly, and characters with stupidly overpowered abilities. This destroys any semblance of the battle royale feel that JT is going for, because some characters have almost no chance of winning.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then you have the production quality. The anime starts off fine, but the production quality really, really dips after the middle. Clearly the issues of pacing showed in the budget as well. The visual quality is all over the place after the initial half.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, despite all these issues, JT does have one of the more interesting finales I have seen so far. I don\u2019t feel like I wasted my time watching JT, although it is far from the best, and if I could go back in time, I wouldn't watch it. If you like the destination rather than the journey, watch JT, otherwise skip it, \u2018cause the journey ain\u2019t that pretty. Hell, one of the reasons I like the finale is because what came before it was bad. It's like being glad that you've reached some horrible war-torn place because your plane ride was so bad.",

            "content": "Juuni Taisen is a battle royale where the characters face off against each other until there is an eventual winner. The differentiating factor here from other similar shows that have come before Juuni Taisen is that there is a tie-in with the Chinese zodiac in that each warrior represents a sign.\r\nI walked in with the expectation that the action might be decent and the story would be mediocre(as is the case with most anime of this type). What I got was something slightly different from those expectations. The story had a very strong start with it's first episode and set the tone well for therest of the series. However even in the first episode, it was easy for me to guess who the winner of the Juuni Taisen might be and this was eventually confirmed be the spoilerish ending song(My suggestion would be to not look at the visuals for the ED if you don't want to know the outcome of how the battle plays out beforehand).\\n\r\nAnother thing that slightly irked me initially was that the outcome of the fights between the characters felt underwhelming when compared to the expectations I had in my head as the fights lacked the action I was looking for. However upon thinking about it, the fights felt more realistic in that all it takes is for the slightest mistake/miscalculation to occur or even just being unlucky on that particular day for your life to be forfeit. I was able to appreciate what the show was trying to do more after making this realization.\\n\r\nI loved the art style of the show and I thought the character designs were interesting in particular. The animation in comparison was average most of the times with 3D animation being utilized for some of the fights scenes. The 3D wasn't horrible and I had no problems with it, it's  just something to make note of.  The soundtrack was barely noticeable but at the same time I can't say it was bad either.\\n\r\nI thought that the characters of the show were very likable and entertaining and made my watching experience of Juuni Taisen a very easy one. A negative aspect for me in my opinion is that even though most characters got backstories(try to ignore the death-flags that these stories cause), it still feels like the character development in the show was slightly lacking. Then again, I didn't need that much more character development in a battle royale to begin with.\\n\r\nAlthough the result of the Juuni Taisen became predictable rather quickly, the anime was enjoyable and I was always looking forward to the new episodes as they came out to see how the battle royale would develop. I'd like to note here that the show had a strong conclusion and I thought the way it was executed was excellent. Juuni Taisen isn't necessarily a show I would recommend to anyone but personally it was one that in the end, I was happy and satisfied that I watched it.",

            "content": "Juuni Taisen is not a good show. It has good moments in it, and the occasional character I liked, but it is not a good show. Yet for the entire 12 episodes, I was never forcing myself to keep watching it. \r\nLet's start with how it's not a good show. At first, it kinda sets itself up as a battle royale with no main character and as such is just a \"pin your hopes and see who survives\" sort of ordeal. However, if you know about the Chinese Zodiac, watch the end credits, or have basic pattern recognition, you will know the order of deathsand who will die. Okay, then maybe it's the sort of show where the appeal is not what will happen, but how it will happen. Except that for the most part, for a battle royale show, the battles aren't really that interesting. There's a few moments, but generally this show doesn't go for big climactic moments, but more understated deaths, usually to its detriment. Then maybe the characters pull it through?\\n\\n\r\nActually, that's probably the closest answer. The characters aren't great, but seeing how and why each of them is in this is actually kinda interesting. There are some characters I grew to like or find their motives interesting enough to keep watching, but the basic pattern recognition mentioned above comes in here, as the death order is the order in which characters give their backstory. Consistently. \\n\\n\r\nSo why did I keep coming back? Well, I can unreservedly say I found the last few episodes actually legitimately good, partially due to developing a character that I found really engaging and partially due to some of the twists, but what kept me going through most of the series was actually the how. Just seeing what the characters had planned even if we knew they wouldn't be around to execute it was kinda cool honestly. But even then, this is the sort of set-up I want someone to take and just do it better. A battle royale with no clear protagonist is cool, but it's undermined by a different way of predicting deaths. Some of the characters have interesting motives, but it's cut short by the fact that by the time we hear them, they're close to death. I want someone to try this again and learn from what this show did wrong and make it better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Juuni Taisen gets a critical score of 4/10 with an enjoyment of 6/10. Technically, it's not a good show, but I had a decent bit of fun with it, and did want to see what happened. If it sounds interesting and you're willing to put up with many flaws, it might be worth your time, but there's much better shows out there and nothing here you have to check out by any stretch of the imagination.",

Lets have some amazing fights........or lets just go looking at 12 backstories of some random guys just so you can see them dying 5 minutes later.\r\nStory: This is one of the main reason why its mediecre at best. More than half of story is flashback for every character which also mean that this character will die very soon. It these flashbacks it always is about some pseudo-philosofical teory why somebody fight or what is and isnt good or another bullshit. This is not reasona started to watch these series. I want to see good fight, i want to see intrique, betrayal, suprise atacks, guessing who will die first. None of this is here. Every fight with one exeption end one minute after it begins many times with some deus ex machina move. First time is really suprising and refreshing after many shonens which can have 5 minute of fight have in 3 episodes. but after third episode it gets boring and predictable. And another problem is that is not suprising who will die next. There is way to know it and you dont even have to give it much thinking. I knew who will die in episode 9 after i saw just 3 episodes. So you have series who wants you to guess who will die next but also it will just tell you before it even begins. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I must say characters are little bit interesting. Every character have his way of killing which could be interesting to see. Every character have some reason to go to this deathmach some of them even know they wont probably survive but they still go there. Some of them have even some kind of special power which can make fight even more interesting......but its one why isnt nearly as good how it could be. There is little bit of spoiler. One of the character is necromant(it was shown in first episode so not much of spoiler). So instead of seeing some interesting fights with clash of ideals or protecting someone. we have fight agaist corpse. which can move even without head. How can be this interesting? Also this whole ability have some really big asspulls. Some of the charactercs can be little bit interesting but thats about it. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Unfortunately i never give much attetion to music so cant say if its good or bad because without opening/ending i never can remember any of music. I must say that i quite liked them so i dont see any problem here. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: It started good. nothing exeptional but not bad either. But with every episode it gets worse to the point you can see bad links without even trying. It may be because lack of funds or more probably lack of time. But still its not good. 4/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Like i said it started really good after first 2 episodes it would be clearly 9/10 but then it started to go down really quickly. Seeing flashback every episode with it taking it at least half of episode it gets boring. And because i already know winner and even order of dying it takes away every little suprise. And the bigges problem its anime about fighing almost without fighting. How can this be any good? 4/10(and gets lower)\\n\\n\r\nSummary: It had really good potetial being first true battle royal without clear winner from begining. Unfortunately it got lost in endless backstories with actual fight taking less than 5 minutes in every episode. Overall 5/10 with one point taking it for having potetial.",

The story for this series in particular is very hit or miss. If you think you could enjoy a show that OBVIOUSLY kills off all but one character in a specific fashion then it's very good. The show accomplishes what it says it will. It's exactly what it says. It was very good for what it was and most of the characters were different and interesting. The ending is, I guess, 'predictable', but only becausethe premise itself does not allow for a surprise. This show was not meant to have some deep dark story or massive character development, nor was it trying to bring something in that it could not execute properly. It was entertaining and did occupy me for the 12 episodes. It is a very alternative story for the typical anime, but I was extremely surprised to have enjoyed myself after reading the reviews. I wish people would understand that every anime is different and does not have to conform to everybody's standards on what is 'great'.  Point being, if people are salty in their reviews, don't take their opinion as your major influence when deciding to watch things without a conventional story line. There is a reason so many people have watched this and for me, that's enough proof to support my aforementioned statement.",

            "content": "Juni Taisen\r\nEnglish: Ju = 10, Ni = refers to People, Taisen = War\r\nResult = 10 man war\r\nThis anime is a breed of it's predecessors based on the competition of individuals who must survive to win. Each individual is viewed as honorable masters of war and were chosen by their countries to compete in this battle. Each represents an animal and each has different strengths. The winner of this battle is granted any one wish.\r\nThe advantage that this anime has over other competition-based anime is that many real-life morals are presented for the audience to feast upon. Consequently, you will have a favorite character either becauseof their fighting style or the morals that they represent and their backgrounds. Each character is given at least one episode worth to provide a sustainable background for, and you will likely favor one person's strife over another's. \\n\\n\r\nYou will never suspect when one character will die. It will happen suddenly and without warning.\\n\\n\r\nRatings time:\\n\r\nStory - 8 - The battle for survival is the clear purpose. Not much beyond the battlefield. It is simple in nature, complex in technicalities, and entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nGraphics - 9 - Modern graphics. Nothing insanely crazy, though well done.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack - 9 - Geared for battle. Cool to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10 - I appreciate how each character was given a proper backstory, or at least enough to understand why they are within this war and their feelings. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7 - Because my own personal bias comes into this now. It was an awesome and entertaining watch, though was not given enough episodes, I believe, to further the fulfillment of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended - I think if you want to add an interesting and eccentric anime to your list without expecting too much then this would be a good one.",

            "content": "JUNI TAISEN REVIEW \r\nWARNING: SPOILER ALERT\r\nOVERALL: 6.8\r\nPLOT: 5/10\r\nDifferent types of action series are available out there who can take our interests. It can be horoscope, sins, great heroes, mythology and zodiac signs. This one revolves around chinese zodiac participants who are willing to fight and kill each other for just one wish. The first episode is too exciting, too interesting, the you'll never expected that the whole series will be too predictable. Yes, the action on this one is kind of great but still it lacks on it. There are multiple loopholes and things that you'll find disturbing after watching it. First, why there isa war against zodiacs every twelve years? What happened that time that resulted on this kind of tournament? Second, where is the back story of rabbit? I know that he is a psycho. One who you can't speak normally. But why is he like that? Why did he decide to turn himself into a corpse? He is fighting for his wish to be friends with all of people. Not to kill himself and turn into a monster. Third, the series became too a loop of story and death. Whoever is reminiscing his past will die. So will you really know who's going to survive. Fourth, who are the people betting on them?  Who's the guy in hat? Is he God? And last one, the rat give off a really mysterious aura. Well, he did have a unique skill. But I expected more on him which I shouldn't have. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThey all have a different principle in life. Something they hold onto to keep on living. Something in their past which makes them the person they are in the competition. Truth to be told, the characters are created humanely. They have their bad and good side. They have their strength and weakness. Though I ended up not liking the series, the characters are on different criteria. For me, the characters are great. But still, I expected more in rats' character. \\n\\n\r\nANIMATION AND SOUND: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is great. What will you expect in a new release series, right? The way the things around them breaks and how the series show the expression on the characters face is quite amazing. Most of the time, it is very detailed. The dubbing is also fine.  As well as the opening and ending songs. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile I enjoy in the action brought by this series. It became also predictable which resulted in making it boring. Yes, the action scenes are good, no doubt about that. But overall, the series just take turns from story to death. The most interesting character rabbit is the only one who made me decide to finish the series, I think. \\n\\n\r\nENDING: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is a mess for me. They leave a lot of questions. They leave a lot of unexplainable things in the series. Additionally, the series ended up with a depressing person who has no will to live. No dreams, No wish. Though he did seem happy in the end, I still expected more on him.",

I seen the word edgy been thrown around a lot especially in regards to this anime.\nWhat makes this anime different than other death game type animes like Mirai Nikki is that there is a reason for all of the dark content, this anime has a lot of things to say for just 12 episodes. All of the characters back stories are really deep and thought provoking. \nThere are themes of war and morality that are presented beautifully in this anime. I found that each episode kept on getting better andbetter. I think this anime can draw a very strong emotional response from the viewer. The only thing is that this anime is predictable. This anime has a formula for the way it progresses and you will be able to pick up on that which is a little disappointing. Also I found the ending to not be as good as the rest of the show.\\n\nAnyways I think this is a very deep anime and I highly enjoyed it.\\n\n(Story: 8)  (Art: 7)  (Sound: 8)  (Character: 9)  (Enjoyment: 9)  (Overall: 8)",

Then it changed by the final of the show but it can't justify the horror we had to through toreach these chapters.\\n\\n\r\n2.

            "content": "In short, Juuni Taisen is a skippable anime.  It starts out very strong, but then the battle royale scenario gets drowned out by long back stories and a lackluster plot. . The back stories were the heart of this show and really took away from anything else Juuni Taisen could have brought to the table.  Nothing else about the show really stood out or kept me entertained past episode 1. As a battle royale in general it was bad. None of the characters really utilized much of a plan or the environment. They all seemed to leave the starting spot and go about100 feet in the same general direction before squaring off.  The outcome of the whole show, and each episodes battles were very predictable. I picked my winner in episode 1 and got it right on the money.  I guess when 4-5 of the 6 hours are used for back stories, you don\u2019t have time to do much with the actual battle or present day plot.  Oh well...\\n\\n\r\nAfter one episode I was all in. The art was decent, the music was exciting, and there were unique and exciting camera angles that really caught my eye. The story seemed like it was going to have a good pace, and the characters seemed unique and mysterious. After the first episode I could not wait to continue the series.  The remaining episodes in my opinion both hit the brakes hard, and took the show in a direction that just didn\u2019t interest me. The music stayed at a high quality, but there were points that the animation seemed to take a big drop in quality.  The camera angle and slow motion scene from the first episode was never topped or equaled by any other scene in the show.  The characters were extremely forgettable, and I really didn\u2019t feel invested in the contest at all. I just wanted it to end....\\n\\n\r\nThis is my little blurb after reading the top review for this show.  I think it is only natural to compare shows that are in the same generic bubble, such as Juuni Taisen and Fate. Comparisons like this are only natural, just like comparing French fries from 2 fast food restaurants. Can you like both? Yes. Can you hate one and like the other?  Sure! Is the statement, \u201cthis is much worse than Fate\u201d valid? 100%. I would hope that statement would be backed up with some solid logic, but I think that comparing 2 like shows is totally ok, especially as you probably get a lot of fans of something like fate checking out reviews to see if this is worth a watch. \\n\\n\r\nI guess that wasn\u2019t too short Sorry!\\n",

I had complaints here and there but the show did it's job of making me want to see it through. But god was that ending just absolute and utter trash. Not only does a warrior have a complete mental break down despite their ability that you think would have made them immune to something like that, but they had a very clear and simple wish. They even straight up said that theywanted someone else's wish to come true but that they never figured it out.... THAT RIGHT THERE IS YOUR WISH THEN IDIOT. It's simple...if they can make any wish come true and you want \"BLANKS\" wish to come true than just say \"I wish blanks wish came true\" done. Instead you get the piece of crap wish and ending they give you. Should have known though. From the start it was basically like an anime made straight out of george r.r. martins notes. Lets introduce you to ned stark, you'll find this character super interesting. Ha jk we are just gonna kill him instantly and everyone else you start to enjoy in this show. Shit hopefully game of thrones actually has an ending that closes it well.\\n\\n\r\nSo pretty much just watch episodes 1-11. DO NOT watch 12. Just use your imagination on what you think they wish for because honestly, absolutely anything would have been better.",

            "content": "If you like buff bunny guys in boyshorts then this ones got you covered. What a wonderful human nature study, sadly I feel people either don't get the point of it or just don't care. This series based off the light novel by the same name features 12 Zodiac Fighters in a battle royal for their wish to be granted. Let's start by saying if you want drawn out fights, this series isn't for you. If you want a series that you and your mates can place bets on who will win, this isn't for you, If you want a series that ends up beinga revolution \"rah rah fight the power,\" this isn't for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe story actually makes a risky decision of focusing on the characters were watching, and deciding their moves. Instead of showing any long choreographed action. Not to say there isn't any action, but some might not appreciate how quick the payoff is with how much buildup there is. Not to mention when they do fight the action is very fast paced and it does that thing where half of it is CGI which at times works in its favor, but for the most part looks really cheap despite the rest of the animation being well done with amazing lighting and camera work. That and the dark murky colors really match the mood of the series and emphasizes on how each characters are feeling. Dark brown the character is upset, Blood red a character is frustrated. The art goes really well with how the characters are feeling and in return how you should be feeling. The music works well too. The intro theme being the perfect mood setter that is amplified by two scores. The first is a soft piano piece typically played as a way to signal that a character is hopeless and it really is effective. A lot like the song \"Say Something\" by A Big World. In fact several times I thought it was what they were playing. The other noticeable piece is the complete opposite. This one sounds like bagpipes mixed with women screaming giving the show a very disturbing feel to it and is very effective.\\n\\n\r\nSo you may be asking why give it a Nine if its a battle royal with hardly any good battle. Well that's the reason I feel it impressed me so much. It's not necessarily a dark edgy gorefest like Deadman Wonderland, or Elfin Lied. This is closer to a psychology piece on twelve different Assasin\\Soldier\\Murderers. The show deals most of its run time showing us the different behaviors and thought processes on ten of the warriors through narration. And looking at it this way makes it one of the more fascinating series in a while in my opinion. All of them are so different from one another from Ushii(OX) \"The Genius of Slaughter\" who starts off as a single note stoic murderer before we take a look into his thought process, in wich he transforms into the guy I was rooting for. Such complexity is further shown when each of them except one get flashbacks each episode to go with their narration to further make you attached to each only to kill them off at a later time. Making for its own twisted kind of drama. That is if your watching it with the right mindset.\\n\\n\r\nMy thoughts are if you haven't watched yet go in not expecting amazing fights, or a mystery on whose going to win. If that's your kinda thing then I'd rethink this one. The winner is easily deducible after two or three episodes hell the end credits tell you who wins. Its better to watch it thinking not when each will die but how and its relation to the build up. I didn't expect any of these guys to die the way they do, Its the build up to their death where you get your reward. \\n\\n\r\nLastly if your really into philosophy or Chinese literature or just references to anything you will have a blast with this show. Whether its figuring out how each of their choices in outfit is linked to their animals. Or the different references they make in one liner form for example \"Didn't you hear about the story of the rabbit that leaped over the moon?\" And many others. So if your looking for complex character studies give it a watch. If you want a gory battle royal....Hunger Games is still a thing right?",

So, the first impression of the anime was: \"There are going to exist a variety of strategies for each warrior, and this is the anime focus.\" But no. The anime focus on the past of each warrior, to see their difficult past.\r\nLet's start by the Art and the Sound (7 and 4, respectively): The 3D element is well used in the anime, and that was the only thing that caught my attention about the art. About the sound, well... I like the opening.\r\nCharacter (8): The characters are very well made, and have definedtypes of thought. As the anime shows their past, the characters gets closer to the viewer. The exception to the rule is like, the Horse.\\n\\n\r\nStory (4): It have no story, its literally 12 guys fighting to grant a wish. Just that and the backstory of each warrior. There are some parts of the anime that really seems to be killing the time too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (3): Sounds like a cliche right? But it isn't. It presents a Fate type of story but it tells us the backstory of each character, all in 12 episodes. It is predictable as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (4): Watch Juuni Taisen if you like to see individual stories, because the main one it's just so irrelevant and predictable that it turns out to be boring.",

            "content": "While people may prize the unpredictability of a show as something that is pivotal in deciding whether its a hit or miss for them, Juuni Taisen is able to execute its plot decently with the intention of wanting their audience to have full awareness of the way the show will progress, including its ending. Yes, you heard me right, it's ENDING. So what value is there in watching something in which you already know the events that will unfold? While to put it simply, it's HOW these said events happen. Because as cliche as 'it's about the journey, not the destination' sounds, it does applyto this show to a certain extent. At the end of it all, the ending itself isn't anything mindblowing (which is what I initially had my hopes for), but the route that the show takes us through is what that really matters. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, this show is far from being deemed as a masterpiece. It had a very strong start (one of the most shocking endings of a first episode might I add), and just when I was about to coin it the anime of the season, things went downhill with the plunge in animation, pacing and storytelling in general. The animation in the later episodes of 6-9 was such an eyesore, not because its the worst art I've seen in the entirety of my anime watching experience, but because in comparison to the astonishingly detailed and smooth action sequences in episodes 1 and 2, the distinct difference in quality was extremely apparent. But, to give the show its benefit of the doubt, I assume my enjoyment would be raised higher should the show have sufficient budget to pull of what it intended to. \\n\\n\r\nAnd while it's one thing to want the audience to be able to predict what happens next, it's another to be highly formulaic in the execution, leaving us only with the empty shell of what Juuni Taisen aimed to be \u2014 a series that was no short of some extremely mediocre episodes. I'm talking about ones that were so badly structured, with flashbacks thrown in abruptly with no sense of direction. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, when I think back to certain moments that left me shell-shocked and so desperately wanting more when the ending credits kicked in, I'm able to barely close an eye and pretend that such episodes were merely a deja-vu that are not actually in the show. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I acknowledge that many might find this show to be garbage (as reflected in its poor ratings), but despite the holes in its narrative and subpar animation quality, it did resonate with me emotionally and has made me ponder on certain philosophical things that I'd never given any attention to prior to watching Juuni Taisen. The characters were also memorable and unique, and despite some of them having barely any screen time, they all left an impression on me. Lastly, I loved the openings and endings of this anime so that's also a plus! :) \\n\\n",

            "content": "The worst anime I have seen this season. (There may be some  spoilers in here.)\r\n-Story-\r\nAn action fantasy battle royal, with the action being small and or nonexistent with the fantasy being wasted or introduced through interesting abilities. The idea was for twelve combatants, one bearing the title of a specific zodiac, to fight to the death so they could be giving a wish at the end. It basically ended up being a poor man's Fate series.\r\n-Art-\r\nWas fine to star and I gave some leeway as many 12 season series don't always have the best art. Though maybe I can be too giving in thisarea.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\r\nThe OST was actually pretty good itself, by itself I mean. The music didn't fit in so many scenes, either too emotional for what was happening or just wasn't proper. Like I said the music itself was good but was just implemented poorly. Very poorly.\\n\\n\\n\r\n-Characters-\\n\r\nUninteresting. They were just one directional, too easily changed or just nonexistent in most cases. Which was weird seeing as the show was basically a full episode about each character. I watched everything feeling so detached and bored. Not to mention the ability overload of some characters. \\n\\n\r\nSome of them had skills that were just obscenely strong if really actually use and ended up just being wasted. I'm specifically referring to the 3rd, 4th, 6th, 8th and 9th deaths and even though you know who was going to die it didn't justify how or they died. \\n\\n\r\nReal quick, an issue most people have is that the deaths are in reverse zodiac order. While I personally have no issues with the order system the deaths could have been implemented better, the characters are given more interesting background or moments and could have been less predictable. Just because you know someone will die doesn't mean how they die doesn't matter.\\n\\n\r\nThere plenty more I could say about this but I'll pass it for now.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment-\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show only because I watched it with a friend and we'd rant and make fun of the show. It's a show I enjoyed making fun of more than I generally actually enjoyed. \\n\\n\r\n-Overall-\\n\r\nIt felt poorly done, lackluster, thrown together on a whim and all in all disappointing. I would be willing to give the show another try if it was remade to be long and more fleshed out because I don't mind the idea of the battle royal, character abilities, backstories, where and how the fight takes place and so on. It's just the way it was done was poor at best and left MUCH to be desired. \\n\\n\r\nWould not recommend to any who want a serious show, but would offer it as a good show to watch for joke value.\\n",

            "content": "The best way I can describe Juuni Taisen in one word is \"inoffensive\". It takes very, very few risks, and brings very, very little to the \"battle royale\" genre as a result.\r\nSTORY: Juuni Taisen is your traditional \"battle royale\" anime story-wise (12 people compete for the chance to win one wish of their choosing granted, modern day setting and technology, whoop-de-doo) save for one thing- the perspective the story is being told from varies from episode to episode. It's nothing particularly groundbreaking, but it creates a small sense of suspense in that we have no \"favorite\"- there's no Saber, no Katniss- there is no explicithero/heroine, so the viewer can choose who they're rooting for from a near unbiased standpoint. Certain twists interested me, not going to lie, but many of the character's backstories bored me. \\n\\n\r\nART: Gory. Completely inoffensive. It's not awful, and the character designs are interesting, but I kind of expected more from a \"battle royale\" anime visually. The battles we see are lacking in quality animation, especially in later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: Again, inoffensive. Does nothing of praise, but doesn't deserve criticism. There are no interesting musical pieces present, and the sound effects in battle are just kind of \"there\". Voice acting was just ok, as well.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: This is where this anime shines (if it really shines anywhere), and I can't say too much without spoiling deaths and such so I will leave it at an admittedly vague statement of \"I was pleasantly surprised\". The characters are much more complex then they appear at first, and their interactions are one of the few things that save this show from truly scraping the depths of mediocrity. Many characters interacted in ways I didn't expect, and positively affected my perception of the show overall.  Although some characters had muddy motivations, those who got a full episode explaining their backstory were quite well developed with decently clear (albeit not the most original/interesting) motives.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: I enjoyed Juuni Taisen a fair bit, being intrigued at points but absolutely disinterested at others. I found it absolutely average, unquestionably so, starting around episode 5, but it rebounded back a little bit towards its last couple episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Juuni Taisen is just ok, and nothing else. It's not of the quality I would've expected from Nisio Isin, seeing his other works (namely the Monogatari Series) adapted and written far better. There are, indisputably better anime, especially \"battle royale\" anime, out there, so watch those first, even if you're a Nisio Isin fan.\\n\\n\r\n5/10.",

            "content": "Oh boy, here we go.\r\nIf I can sum up this anime in one word, it would be \"disappointment.\" \r\nFrom the predictable plot, to the animation's fluctuating quality, this show goes down the drain pretty hard.\r\nThe first episode of Juuni Taisen actually impressed me heavily, to the point of thinking it could be anime of the season. The fight choreography was spot-on, the animation had its own distinct look, characters, and it even had one of the best anime scenes i've probably ever witnessed. (At the end of the first episode, you'll know it when you see it.)\r\nBut after that everything is a train wreck. Tosay this anime is predictable is an understatement. You will know when a character will die, always. And there is no suspense because of this. To put this in perspective, it follows the 12 Chinese Zodiacs in order, it shows the entire characters backstory right before they die, and even in the very opening of the show it shows you in reverse order who will die. And that's probably the biggest flaw of the show. \\n\\n\r\nIgnoring other plot points that never really got addressed at the end of the show, my other biggest complaint was the animation. The animation fluctuates CONSTANTLY. In the first episode, it's wonderfully and smoothly animated. Later on, characters lack details like faces , their hands and limbs look like doodles, and at one point for some reason Ox was missing a horn and in the next scene it was back in place. Then, it gets even more inconsistent with the introduction of heavy 3D CGI. Even while characters were standing in place, only moving their mouths, their entire body has been replaced with CG models. I have no reason why this decision was made, but it was a poor one. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of it all, to all of those who died in the show, they all died terribly unsatisfying. Right when you think there will be an epic battle, somebody just gets stabbed and they die. This applies to every single character. They pop in, say their introductions to eachother, then they just die and plop to the ground. It's not a long drawn out battle or even a seat clincher. For a show in the genre of and based around action, there's a significant lack of attention to it.\\n\\n\r\nI can really only recommend this show if you're bored and just need something to fill that gap. But if you are looking for something with substance or even mindless action, you're gonna have to look elsewhere.",

            "content": "I would like to start off this review by saying PLEASE skip the ED and previews if you want to watch this series. They do contain spoilers.\r\nSo, what were the good parts of Juuni Taisen? The art was honestly pretty nice, in my opinion. Occasionally there was some distracting 3DCG used, but otherwise there was this nice sketchy style throughout the series that was nice to look at and matched the tone. The character designs were also good, matched the characters themselves, and easy to tell apart - well, except for the Tatsumi brothers, whose voices, appearances and personalities are stupidly similar. This wasn't evenfor any real reason and was flat-out confusing. Fortunately other than the flashback, there are... other ways to tell them apart, so it wasn't too much of a problem. Sound is also fine, nice OP and ED, decent enough soundtrack. The deaths, although predictable, were entertaining to watch, and the fight choreography was good, and there's plenty of blood.\\n\\n\r\nSo what did it get wrong? Well, the character deaths are predictable as hell. It follows an episodic pattern, as well as another pattern that becomes obvious after a few episodes. The characters are somewhat bland with very basic motivations, and it would've definitely been nicer to go more into depth into the stories of some of them, but there's only so much that can be done in twelve episodes. The characters' powers are ridiculously unbalanced as well. The last few episodes are particularly egregious with this, where certain characters have a stupidly long amount of time to get out of bad situations. The powers themselves are also somewhat nebulous in their rules - why can this character use their power to do this thing, but then suddenly they can't do that thing later on? To what extent do their powers work? There are a lot of moments when you're just shouting at the screen because of missed opportunities.\\n\\n\r\nThis is more of a personal grievance than anything, but also, Usagi doesn't get a flashback. He was an interesting character (also my own Zodiac animal) and I looked forward to seeing his motivations and deeper personality, but the closest he gets are a couple short lines detailing his wish.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the series was... good. A decent 7/10. I didn't regret watching it or anything. Again, there were so many things that could've been done better, and so many missed opportunities. Waiting for the twists that never came. The final ending is also idiotic so don't expect anything great. But if you're looking for a run-of-the-mill battle royale that offers a good amount of bloodshed and even some intense gore at some points, then Juuni Taisen will do that job fine.",

            "content": "Juuni Taisen: The NOT Battle Royale Battle Royale.\r\nFor LA, Juuni Taisen was one of the more surprising anime at the start of Fall 2017, LA had huge expectations and by the end of it...........those expectations weren't met.\r\nBut that's still ok.\r\nJuuni Taisen is a battle royale anime about the Chinese Zodiacs personified fighting to be granted one wish. Typical Battle Royale scthick and all.\r\nBut with numerous deaths coming from a mile away, from the ending theme to the deaths going in reverse Chinese zodiac order...hey it's not a spoiler if it's given away in the first 2 episodes!.\r\nSo why is LA saying all this?...well it's thecharacters as small of a screentime they develop that are the central focus of this anime.....as well as the brutal action scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, LA is the Year of the Chicken...so LA should like Niwatori voiced by Ayane Sakura, but LA sees Shuryuu (Monkey) voiced by Saori Hayami and Tora (Tiger) voiced by Hiromi Igarashi having the best character backstory and probably the most likable characters out of the cast. LA hated Usagi voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto and the Tatsumi Brothers voiced by Takuya Eguchi and Kousuke Toriumi as one of them is a homicidal maniac but is one of the most threatening forces in the anime besides Ushii while the other just had the most boring uninteresting character backstory out of the entire cast. OK so character wise it just really depends who you like or hate in this anime and it goes accordingly even if your favourite character dies or not will have an impact which would happen whether your disagree with LA or not with this one.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise by Studio Graphinica, the animation for the most part is done decently from the rather uhhh exotically made character designs to some of the set battle scenes are choreographed quite well. The thing is for LA, LA saw many of later episodes to have dipped in quality to seeing blatant CGI and the choreography flatlined too. So Graphinica long story short, started off well but fell and fell down HARD.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was decent all round and hell, LA even heard of the Funimation Dub as well. So let's start with the Japanese cast. The Japanese cast was VERY good, from Ayane Sakura, Saori Hayami, Yoko Hikasa, Hiromi Igarashi and Nobuhiko Okamoto was great in this anime. Yeeeahhh Nobuhiko voicing Usagi and doing his tranquil crazy scthick was done very well even if LA didn't like Usagi as a character. LA's favourite voice actor in the Japanese department would be Hiromi Igarashi for LA, if only because of Hiromi's consistently drunken accenting and keeping it up for like 90% of the anime was stellar oddly enough, with Saori Hayami being LA's second favourite because..Saori Hayami duh. Moving over to the Funimation Dub and sorry but Jerry Jewel is a great voice actor and all but he hammed it up too much for LA to take him seriously in comparison to Nobuhiko's voice acting. This voice cast was still great, from Collen Clinkenbeard as Tora, Caitlin Glass as Shuryuu and Monica Rial as Niwatori but the MVP this voice cast easily goes to Stephanie Young as  Inounoshishi because damn does she do that mature femme fatale almost similar to Yoko Hikasa!. All in all, the voice cast in both versions is AMAZING and LA would have suggested either versions to anyone who's gonna watch Junni Taisen.\\n\\n\r\nSo you kinda guessed that this anime disappointed LA at the start of this anime review and you are right, as it went into an anti climax and because this is the Chinese Zodiac and all, references and homages to the Chinese Zodiacs. For what the ending tried to do, LA \"gets\" it and everything and but even then LA's expectations of Junni Taisen dipped as soon as the Tatsumi Brothers backstory was put into focus (but then got it back once the focus was put onto Tora), so what the ending did, LA gets it. Ohh and spoilers...kinda. Isin Nisio tried to put the battle royale like as per usual, but it's what's the WISH that becomes important by the end of it. We know from previous wish granting battle royale animes that the protagonist in question, that we know what they will wish for or if the wish granting is gonna be an ass and do the opposite and the wish becomes meaningless. (see Fate/Zero and/or Mirai Nikki). In Juuni Taisen we don't get to find out who the \"main character\" is, let alone the wish is until the finale.....and it's an anticlimax sure but Nisio put focus onto the wish and oddly does not make it meaningless...anticlimactic sure, but meaningless...NOPE.\\n\\n\r\nJuuni Taisen is LA's most disappointing anime for Fall 2017, no doubt, but that's ok.",

            "content": "We've had quite a few edgy shows this season and this is one of them. However, I did keep an open mind while watching it and it was pretty enjoyable.... For a very very little amount of time.\r\n[Story: 6/10]\r\nSo the story surrounds a group of 12 warriors, representing 12 families, who're called by the names of the 12 zodiac signs and they each have powers related to the creature that their sign is. They participate in a battle royal, held once every 12 years called the, \"Juuni Taisen,\" and whoever wins, gets a wish of his or her's granted. Now, if someone enjoys shounen andhas watched a couple of famous shows, they've come across this kind of plot, specifically because of the Fate Series and let's be honest here, the Fate Series isn't always always good but it's pretty enjoyable. Juuni Taisen tries to be the edgier cousin of Fate but it fails. As the story progresses, we learn more and more about each character and delve into their background, we also learn about their individual powers. However, the series mostly follows the 'show and kill formula,' where they show us the past of the character they intend to kill off in that very episode, or in the next episode, this makes the show very predictable as we know who's going to die, for the most part. The answer to who's going to be the final winner is fairly obvious if one pays enough attention as, being the clich\u00e8d show it is, the show tries to put less attention on the important character and hence because we know we have the least amount of information about the Rat, we figure out that he is going to win very early on.\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 6/10]\\n\r\nThere's not much to share about the art to be honest, it's not bad but it's not good either. They do use a little bit of CGI here and there but it's so minimal that it isn't bothersome. The character designs aren't groundbreaking but they do help you remember who's who and what their powers are. The hand to hand combat scenes are well choreographed for the most part, especially in the first couple of episodes.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 6/10]\\n\r\nThe sound track tries to make the atmosphere tense and it does succeed in some cases but overall, it doesn't draw a lot of attention to itself. The OP is an electric guitar laden song, not exactly the type that hypes you up, it has more of a melancholic feel to it.\\n\\n\r\n[Characters: 6/10]\\n\r\nShows like Juuni Taisen rely heavily on their characters because with such a big and diverse cast that demands equal attention, there's really no way to make an overarching and complex narrative that relies solely on the story itself and not the characters. Juuni Taisen throws at us 12 people with varied motives that aren't explained. Simply put, we slowly figure out why these people are fighting but we don't know what they are fighting for. We don't know what they want, sure we do find out in the case of Nezumi but, for the most part we don't know and I refuse to believe that everyone is like Nezumi and they never thought about what they wanted. In the case of Sheep however, we are aware that he is fighting in the place of his grandchild and so we can assume that he doesn't have an ulterior motive.\\n\\n\r\nSince almost every character is explored within the confines of an episode, it's very difficult to figure out wether we like them or not. The actions of these characters have had a profound effect on the battlefields of the world and yet it feels like they're inconsequential. Simply put, Juuni Taisen fails to make us care for these characters.\\n\\n\r\nBy far, the most interesting characters on this show are The Rabbit, The Ox and The Monkey. The Monkey makes the interesting character list because of her understanding of the way that peace works, her non violence beliefs should disqualify her as a warrior but she still is one, a rather good one at that. The Ox makes the cut because he is the most level headed out of all of them and he is different because he doesn't have a special power but he has experience and technique. The Rabbit is just bat shit crazy and a crazy factor is needed in shows like these. Nezumi would've made the cut had they put more attention on him and his very interesting but overpowered ability.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 5/10]\\n\r\nJuuni Taisen is pretty enjoyable in parts but these parts are few and far between. Being predictable isn't necessarily a bad thing but in this case, it makes the show uninteresting. The fight choreography can be enthralling and do give us moments of joy but that's about it. One isn't really attracted to the OP not the ED.\\n\\n\r\n[FINAL SCORE: 6/10]\\n\r\nI won't call Juuni Taisen a massive waste of time or anything but I would suggest that you only watch it if you're hard pressed to find anime that you actually want to watch. If you enjoy a predictable plot that has some moments of good action then sure, give this a go. \\n",

            "content": "This is my first review so it might not turn out that good but I`ll try anyway\r\nSo Juuni Taisen was one of the shows I was excited about for this season for a number of reasons : 1. The original light novel was written by Nisio Isin who created Monogatari which we all probably know and which I really enjoyed watching 2.The synopsis was just like Fate/Stay Night but with more competitors and no masters and Fate is another of my favorite anime 3. I usually enjoy these battle royal anime and I was expecting some twists from this because Isin is known for creativity.\\n\\n\r\nYa needless to say this show did not live up to the hype or my expectations. \\n\\n\r\nStory 5/10:\\n\r\nSo what I wanted to see was an all out battle between any number of the competitors because that`s what a battle royal should be about, the battles. Instead the show is created so that around 80% of the time the characters are monologuing about something or you are watching a flashback. Now I admit some of the flashbacks were interesting like Ox and Tigers. However the majority of them are pretty forgettable. Also it is kind of pointless since usually the character in the flashback would meet their demise after it ends. Even when the characters were fighting it would usually end quickly and most of the fights never gave me that epic feeling that I wanted to experience from this show. The flashbacks also ruin the plot twists I wanted to see. Except for the first episode where you did not expect the person in the flashback to get killed after it was over it became painfully obvious after the first one on what you should expect.  \\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10:\\n\r\nCan`t really say much about the animation it does not leave much of an impression. It was not that good and not terrible either. It suited the flashbacks well but to me did not really feel like the best animation for fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 4/10:\\n\r\nThe music in this anime never stood out to me. During the many flashbacks I understand having loud and action themed music would not work when the characters were not fighting. It might have helped to have decent music playing during those scenes though to make them less boring but instead it was usually either quiet or ambient. Even during the fight scenes the music played just felt like your generic tracks that could be found in any battle anime. The opening sounded really whiny and the visuals in it were just shots of the characters doing cool poses so it does not add much. I have some things to say about the ending though. The ending music actually sounds really good and livens up the show. I feel that if it was played during the opening it might have been better. The main thing about the ending is that it basically spoils the show. If you payed literally any attention to it you see that the order shown in it is the order the characters are killed so ya the show pretty much spoils the winner for you on its own.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10:\\n\r\nThe characters were average. Some were just forgettable because they never really did anything of note and the only thing you knew about them was what you saw in their respective flashback. The only characters that stood out to me were Rat, Ox , Tiger, Monkey and Rabbit. In the start of the show when you see Rabbit it leaves an impression on you. You think this guy would just be some kind of insane killer and you`d be right but really he just wanted some friends and his power lets him have friends, in a way. He was a cool character with his playboy outfit and dual machetes and when I first saw him I did not think he would get as far in the contest as he did and be as strong as he was. Monkey was one of those typical characters you would always see in battle royal anime who doesn`t want to fight and wants peace for the world as a whole. I would have liked to have seen more of her and see what her plan may have been to accomplish that goal but you can probably tell what happens to her. Ox was another decent character. His fight scenes were probably the best part of the show but there weren`t that many of them. He was the character that always fights fair and does not hold back on anybody. Tiger was the character I did not expect much of. Most of the show she was not present but when she does show up you see her as some kind of drunken martial arts master. The thing I liked about her was why she became and drunk and her connection with Ox. Their joint flashback was pretty touching and you feel bittersweet when she dies. Rat was the enigma of the show. You don`t see his power until the very end and it is a creative one but Rat himself did not live up to his buildup. Especially the last episode makes you feel like in the end the whole show was a waste of time you could have spent watching something better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10:\\n\r\nThis just was not the show for me. If you can find enjoyment from watching a lot of flashbacks be my guest but it didn`t do it for me. If the flashbacks were so long the fight scenes should have at least been an epic climax but that was not the case. I guess it was more realistic than having long drawn out fight scenes but still that would have been more entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10:\\n\r\nAs I have explained the show wasn`t what I expected it to be. It was predictable most of the time expect for the first episode. The fights and music were mediocre at the best of times and the conclusion was not worth watching the other 11 episodes. If you want a good battle royal anime this isn`t for you. Unless you are a really dedicated Nisio Isin fan you`re better off not watching this and watching some other battle royal anime instead. If you like flashbacks than this is the anime for you.\\n\\n",

The Boars death caught me off guard, but that was the highest point of the series. The next few episodes were ok as we learn more about the juuni taisen. The last few episodes were repetitive and Nezumi's final wish made little sense. In fact, I think the majority of the plot made little sense. How can so many professional mercenaries let their guard down every single time?? even with Nezumi's ability I find that the mercenaries should not be making those mistakes... \r\nThe art and music were prettygood, but that is all the anime had going for.",

            "content": "Fair warning to anyone who might have expectations based on the synopsis or promotional video: Juuni Taisen is NOT a battle royale. It is a character drama about the twelve participating warriors, with each episode dedicated to flashbacks for the warrior of the week, and you should temper your expectations accordingly. There is some action in each episode, but overall you will see warriors' showcase their powers in fights against soldiers/gangsters/etc. and not so much against each other\r\nThe Good:\r\nJuuni Taisen's definitely bucks convention in how it presents its story, which can be refreshing to people who are tired of the standard (some might argue stale)way of storytelling in anime; a few of the characters are interesting, with well defined origins, motivations, and growth in their characters; the opening and ending themes are great.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\nDespite bucking storytelling convention, Juuni Taisen over-uses the exact same formula for every episode, which makes it extremely predictable; this formula also makes all of the characters are largely disposable, so you're unlikely to become invested in most of them; animation and art quality suffers immediately after the first episode and takes until episode 10 to improve again (they introduce CGI for a few fight scenes, it's not terrible though, but you will notice it). \\n\\n\r\nThe Ugly:\\n\r\nJuuni Taisen doesn't try to be an action anime, it doesn't even try to be unpredictable (seriously, ending credits spoils the order of the episodes and who ultimately wins), so it can only be judged by the strength of its cast of characters... but it's an incredibly inconsistent cast, with a third being very interesting, a third being serviceable, and the remaining third being incredibly shallow and forgettable; it's a story that abandons everything to do one thing very well, but fails as much as it succeeds.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not bad, but it's not particularly good either.

The dialogue and storylines are relatively simple, however the show plays in such a manner that the repeated themes help play into the realism aspect of war. I really don\u2019t have much more to say without revealing the plot so I hopethat by the end of this sentence the review will be long enough.",

            "content": "Story 6/10\r\nI'm usually drawn towards series with premises that I haven't heard of before and I've been looking for a new battle royale anime to watch. In this aspect it partially succeeded - it was a battle royale but it doesn't really seem to focus too much on that. Any given episode mostly focuses on interpersonal problems within the characters, which is interesting but I would prefer some more info on the battle itself considering the audience is just told \"we hold a battle royale every year for some reason\" and not much else is mentioned about it. This results in a confusing story thatfocuses too much on sob-stories instead of getting to the details the audience really wants to know.\\n\\n\r\nArt 2/10\\n\\n\r\nNoticeable drops in animation quality. VERY noticeable. The line thickness changes on a frame by frame basis, proportions are completely out the window, sometimes they use CGI (which seems to be the best quality so far) and other times characters just don't move during very important scenes. The backgrounds have been fine but the characters themselves are stiff, not proportioned right and honestly funny looking. I've seen 3 minute animations done by amateur students that are better than the entire \"professional\" studio working on a half hour show. Overall, very inconsistent.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is really good, probably the best part about the series. It's FILLED with spoilers but only to those who can read symbolism very well. The voice acting is less than great but I imagine some of the sound effects would make more sense if the animation would catch up a bit. For example, if I character growls or scoffs at someone, the face doesn't move with them making that noise, so it seems very odd sounding/looking. I think most of the sound problems can be blamed on the animation because there are many examples like that where you watch it, hear it and think \"why...did they make that noise? that sounded so weird...\" but in reality, they're probably just reading the script they're given and they can't really do much about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 4/10\\n\\n\r\nSome of the writing for the characters is really reaching for the audience to pity them. Some backstories went on for over two episodes and at some point I was like \"who cares anymore!? Just move on!\". Its unreasonable for the producers to write 12 sob-story character backgrounds and expect all of them to land. Each character should be different and in a weird way they're all the same. \"I was sad as a child, I started training to be part of the juuni taisen, I started doing bad things, I'm sad (or happy) that I did so many bad things\" and then they die. The design of the characters is also pretty rough. Monkey, Tiger and Rabbit in particular have outfits that don't make a lot of sense. Monkey has like 3 coats on, thigh high socks and combat boots and no pants, Tiger just has a bikini and a leather jacket, and Rabbit is supposed to be like...playboy bunny I guess?? All of the girls outfits are pretty skimpy except for Boar and everyone else is dressed pretty randomly, though not necessarily badly. It's just easy to get visually distracted when watching any given episode because of the colour clashing, seasonal wear differences, and outfits that just don't make sense for an anime about survival. If they're supposed to be fighting for their lives, maybe a bikini isn't the best protective gear? all in all, costume design and writing needed to be refined quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment would be higher if not for how long the series can drag something out for. The series honestly wastes so much time on ONE thing that it frustrates the audience into thinking about how much they could've covered if they would've just let the sob-story die about 10 minutes in instead of using it for the full 30 minutes. For example, one episode was dedicated entirely to Sheep thinking of a plan on how to survive, except his plans involved characters that had already died and didn't really make sense. He repeats himself several times in the episode and at the very end decides to generally scrap the plan and move on to something else. Lots of wasted time that I didn't enjoy on things that could've been enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\\n\r\nPoor animation, poor design and poor writing. At this point I'm watching the series to find out how it ends. The concept is good and the opening is good but its hard to think of a character I like or anything in particular that stood out as \"good\". Its not particularly extraordinary but if it were maybe rebooted in the future with better animation I may be a little more generous.",

            "content": "War.  War never changes.  People die when they are killed, greed overpowers all, fighting never gets us anywhere, yada yada yada.  At some point in our lives, we've all heard a spiel kinda like this, and repeated doses of the phrase demotes the saying to an irritating platitude that means absolutely nothing.  So, if you want to decide the fate of the world, what do you do?  Pit 12 people against each other of course.  What other way would there be?\r\nStory:\r\nEvery 12 years, twelve warriors are gathered together in order to participate in the Juuni Taisen, a battle royalein which the twelve warriors, each representing one of the animals in the chinese zodiac, fight to the death in order to get one selfish wish granted and determine the fate of the world.  On the eve of the twelve Juuni Taisen, the 12 warriors gather up, and the event to see which animal will come out on top commences.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, Juuni Taisen appears to be a nonsensical gorefest as the twelve warriors duke it out in an abandoned city, each equipped with their own method of killing representative of their respective animal.  Its main problem as a series stems from how little the show is willing to stay as a simple concept.  With each episode, we're introduced to one of the twelve warriors' backgrounds, introduced to a world plagued with war that eventually molds them into the person (or animal...) that they become by the start of the Juuni Taisen.  This in and of itself poses a problem for the viewer because once you figure out the pattern, the experience becomes all the more lackluster cause the place order and by extension the winner is easy to figure out.  \\n\\n\r\nThe result of this eventually muddies the content of the show greatly, spending an abhorrent amount of time on so much backstory and world building information on each of the twelve warriors that what you end up getting is less battle and more \"listen to my edgy and sad backstory\".  This ultimately breaks the flow of the show as in the middle of a battle, we're forced to listen to up to an episode's worth of information before we're thrust back into the action as if we're supposed to care for the respective warrior whose backstory we just finished watching.  \\n\\n\r\nEventually, this problem comes full circle when the show gets so stuck up and drunk off of the philosophies of its various zodiac members that it becomes confusing what the hell they're even talking about.  Everything from 'righteousness' to 'right and wrong', all the way to 'what is my selfish desire' intoxicates the show's runtime to the point that the show's battle royale feels like almost a secondary thought.  While admittedly it is kind of refreshing to see a show spend so much time focused on character development of its main cast, the way they went about was so instrumental to the show ultimate downfall that I acts more as a detriment to what is otherwise a horse-betting competition.  \\n\\n\r\nThe ending also gives the experience a very bittersweet flavor, but not a nice kind.  Frankly speaking, it's pretty much a culmination of everything the show is or tries to be, all wrapped up in a pretentious bow cause it feels like the show feels smug about what it's done with just how much information is jam packed in the episode and how it ended.  Newsflash, it ain't a good end.  An understandable conclusion, but given all the information we were given about the world and the people living in it, I'd expect something a little more than 'Ignorance is Bliss'.  Which I guess you could say is poetic in a way, but I'm not willing to give the show any slack for how piss poor this show was structured.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Fun?  (I mean...it was kinda fun to watch.)\\n\r\n-  Breaks from the action way too often\\n\r\n-  Many unanswered questions\\n\r\n-  Can be predictable once you figure the show out\\n\r\n-  Too much philosophy and attempt to be edgy/thought-provoking\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nNo one else matters except for the Juuni Taisen.  If anything, the supplementary characters are part of the 'world building' and 'character development' attempts that the show made.\\n\\n\r\nThe warriors are unique style-wise, I'll give the show that much credit.  Aside from that, they all, every one of them, leaves something to be desired (except I guess Tiger).  Case in point, they all want something.  Coming from prestigious warrior families or are renowned warriors themselves, the twelve participants enter the ring each with a story to tell: How they rose in power, the way they live their lives, the philosophies they embody, etc.  My main issue stems from how the backstory is relatively simple, but each progressive character we're shown breeds more and more complexity with their stories, to the point that philosophy IS their story.  It's the kind of gradual spoonfeeding that doesn't sit right with me because in a sense, that shows favoritism, and in a battle royale, immediate narrative favoritism reveals who's staying till the end.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect of the warriors is their powers.  For some reason, they all have some kind of special ability that makes each of the warriors superhuman to an extent which makes absolutely no sense to me because a) How and why do they get these powers?  and b) Does everyone in the world have these powers?  Or is it just specific to 'warriors'?  My theory is that this is just the show's excuse to have more edge and battle potential which, while true, poses those questions that loom over the show's entire runtime cause still confused as to how a human being is physically capable of producing a multitude of poisons in his own body or create zombies by killing them.  Seriously, they don't explain this at all and it frustrates me to no end.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Interesting cast\\n\r\n-  Powers make no goddamn sense\\n\r\n-  Again, drowned in philosophy (and pattern makes things kinda easy to figure out.)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nProduced by Graphinica, a small studio with almost nothing major under their belt (they helped animate Hellsing Ultimate, so I guess that's part of their resume), Juuni Taisen's quality wavers greatly.  \\n\\n\r\nOn one hand, the art isn't terrible.  Sure most of its is stills due to the amount of downtime the show seems to have with how often the warrior are willing to sit down and have a chat for some reason, but there aren't many real issues popping up during these moments.  That being said, it's not fantastic either.  Action scenes are kind of choppy as expected of a low budget show, but the real kicker is how the ending fights seem to crank up in intensity and end up relying on CGI in order to showcase these battles.  It's a noticeable change that I'm just vaguely annoyed about after seeing it for the first time.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/-  It's decent, but not great.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\n\"Rupture\" by Panorama Panama Town poses a peculiar standard for the show's soundtrack.  Honestly, I thought that the show would have a more high-energy and intense rock track rather than the smoother and less energetic rock that we got.  Like seriously, I thought we were gonna get some super hype battle music or something, but instead we get...this.  Don't get me wrong, it ain't bad, just not what I expected.  Which I suppose is an upside really all things considering.  I will say that hearing the artist roll their 'r's' like they are is...weird.  Excessive if you ask me.\\n\\n\r\nLikewise, the show's ED, \"Kenshin no Kemono\", is an equally smooth rock track that I didn't expect from a show as battle-filled as this.  Personally, this one is less memorable to its OP counterpart, but it is by no means a bad song.  Honestly, I'd say that the sound is the best part of the show, and whenever that happens, I'm always scared.  I also want to bring special attention to the fact that they managed to get Hayami Saori and Sakura Ayane, some pretty well-known seiyuu to voice in this rather underground show.  Iunno, that's just a detail that vaguely amuses me.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/-  Good, but average soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI really just took a swing at Juuni Taisen to see what I would end up getting by watching this show.  To my surprise, the series actually showed some promise at the start.  Sure I haven't seen many battle royales, but I was at least intrigued to see where it was going.  Turns out, it went badly.  Oh so badly.  The story suffers from being overtly complex, the characters suffer the same way, the art quality wavers greatly, and the sound is more or less average.  Are there any upsides to this show?  Critically speaking...no.  But by not thinking about things too hard like I've done with certain aspects of the show, your mileage will probably increase with this show.  But probably not that much considering the show tries so hard to impress you that you end up hating yourself for falling into the show's trap and think along its lines.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nKind of?  I mean there are philosophies which are interesting enough to see here (Like \"Is what I'm doing right or wrong?\")  But in the context of the show, they don't make any sense so I'd take those words with a grain of salt.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?\\n\\n\r\nUsagi.  I am sorry, but that character is just downright unsettling, and not in the good way.  It's like they sat down and said \"Alright, we need an OP character who's batshit crazy\", threw all of the board's ideas in a hat, then just used everything in the hat anyway to create this monstrosity.  A super muscley individual wearing what is basically stripper gear without any known backstory aside from killing to 'make friends' and can literally not go down even in death to fulfill the 'psychotic person' quota is just asking for trouble.\\n\\n\r\nAlso WHERE IS THE WAR?!  You spent an entire twelve episodes establishing the fact that the world in this show is filled to the brim with war and shit, going so far as to establish a gambling ring for power with the world's countries, yet in the last episode where we're actually in the world and not in the battleground of twelve superpowered individuals, everything seems hunky dory.  Even if they're past events, if the world is as war-filled as you say it is, you could at the very least make the winner watch TV and see that a war is escalating somewhere.  That ain't hard, right?\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nHonestly...no.  At the start I thought that at the very least I could recommend this for some good ol' fashion 'turn off your brain' fun, but the show shoves so much of what it tries to do down your throat that it's not worth the headache.  If you ask me, the show tries way too hard and gets almost no satisfactory result by the end of it.  You might as well have said that none of this ever happened and it was all a dream, cause that what it feels like when that's our end.",

Overall it's good if you just need to spend some times without watching something hard but thrilling, and less thinking.\r\nArt : 8/10\r\nThe design is amazing.

Pleasant for my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 9-9.5/10\\n\r\nThe sound effect, backsound, everything is very supporting with the story. I jumped several times because of the sound effect (like when the monkey popped out from the rabbit's body etc) Also love the OP and ED.
