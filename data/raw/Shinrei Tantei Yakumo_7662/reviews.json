            "content": "'Shinrei Tantei Yakumo' ('Psychic Detective Yakumo') is about Yakumo, an university student and private detective, who has a red left eye that lets him see ghosts and spirits.\r\nThe premise and atmosphere of this show is very similar to 'Ghost Hunt', just that the good guys have no offensive super powers, and the ghosts and spirits are directly harmless. The basic format of the show begins with Haruka asking Yakumo to investigate on a case, he takes a look at the scene, ask for help from allies (police detectives, journalist, priest etc), and puts the spirits at ease after a showdown. At the same time, thereis another parallel story of a group of villains watching Yakumo's move and plotting a evil scheme.\\n\\n\r\nThe introduction was done very well, the characters seemed very interesting, but it seemed to be downhill from there instead of picking up in pace and intensity.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I liked about the story was that it focuses on human beings despite being a show about ghosts. Instead of senseless showcase of super powers, Yakumo and company actually trace back the problems like a real detective, and also focuses on the issue of discrimination he faces for being different. The problem was that none of the cases were particularly interesting nor memorable, and the showdowns are rather anticlimatic. Even the main and final case was severely underdeveloped, as we still don't know the reason \"red eyed man\" became a spirit, why he had the ghost-seeing red eyes, or his relationship with Yakumo and his mother other than the obvious. Painfully slow pacing certainly did not help.\\n\r\nOf course, we're left with an open ending that explains nothing, and starved for another season.\\n\\n\r\nYakumo was an interesting character though, with a complex and painful past that's gradually revealed to us as we follow the cases he was assigned by Haruka. I particularly liked how his antisocial personality was explained by his past and ghost-seeing eye that enabled him to see things others can't. Unfortunately, Haruka existed mostly to set up the case and an attempt to add a little romance to the story. Their chemistry was rather poor, and she rarely play any significant role in solving the cases or development of the protagonist. She was also portrayed as an extremely dumb girl just to demonstrate how smart Yakumo is compared to an ordinary person.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt style was very generic, but the backgrounds had a nice atmosphere. The characters seemed disturbingly flat though. I can't quite put my finger to why it is so, but if I had to guess, it was either awkward shading or lack of detail despite realistic design.\\n\r\nThe presentation was also very boring, standard still camera or slowly moving screens.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBGM was rather good for this series. Sets the creepy mood well, and some sound really touching or melancholic. Unfortunately, the story was nowhere near engaging, and could not take advantage of the music. It also lacked variety, as if every scary scenes had the same song, one for touching scenes, and another mysterious theme.\\n\r\nNo complaints for voicing, everyone sound they should and performed average or better in my opinion.\\n\r\nOP is rather original with the song that sets the mysterious mood for the show, ED was rather ordinary.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI hate to use this word to describe a series, but there's no other way... dull. 'Shinrei Tantei Yakumo' had a strong introduction and all the ingredients to make it a great show, but it just didn't live up to its potential. There's no eye candy since action was very limited, the story lacked suspense despite being a mystery, and the presentation was boring.\\n\\n\r\nIt turned out to be yet another bland forgettable mystery anime. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Shinrei Tantei Yakumo revolves around a strange college student with a cursed red left eye. Through his eye, Yakumo is able to see and communicate with spirits of the dead, helping them move on from their earthly dwelling. \r\nThe events unfold in an episodic format familiar to detective series fans, giving STY the double effect of being easy to follow while having a tendency to be repetitive. Personally, though, I liked the format. Despite the mini-cases, the plot still followed the main conflict, which is big and complex and absolutely mind-boggling. Technically, the art is so-so, but the sound is fantastic. BGM is perfectly timedand gives just the right feeling. \\n\\n\r\nI love this show for its complex plot, and its excellent script. (You know those cheesy lines you only get out of detective stories with psychological drama tendencies?) I hate it for what I feel is its lack of attention on character development, given we only ever hear about Yakumo's life and nobody else's. Oh yes, and the stories aren't scary at all. \\n\\n\r\nShinrei Tantei Yakumo is recommended for lovers of old-style detective mysteries and ghost stories. Although there's admittedly less of the latter than the title implies. It's really just a police story with a paranormal flavor.",

            "content": "Ghosts, the supernatural, and mystery-- with more focus on the former two and less of the latter.\r\nSo far, each episode seems to be formatted like this:\r\nSome character development, a mystery involving a ghost/supernatural forces, foreshadowing of a bigger plot. (And this pattern has stayed consistent on the episodes I've seen so far...)\r\nObviously, with a pattern like this one or all of the three has to be sacrificed and we end up with a mystery per episode that is neither challenging to us nor expanded well on. Just a plain \"oh here's an issue, here's -briefly- what the characters did, and here's the solution.\"\r\nIt's not abad formula but for people who are expecting/wanting a more dramatic or drawn out mystery, it might not quench your thirst.\\n\r\nThe nice thing this series does (so far) is that despite the rather short \"character development\" segments it is done rather cleverly and leaves you a little curious about more and whether they'll have a bigger role later. Same can be said about the segments that seem to \"foreshadow something bigger\" except they are even shorter and may prove more of a tease than anything.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, so far it's an average standard show, it doesn't have a crazy \"cliffhanger ending\" pacing nor is it so slow you wished the episodes would air faster. \\n\\n\r\n((Edit/Note: in the later part of the series the pattern has changed so that character/background development has become a bigger part of the episodes-- however this results in the \"mystery per episode\" parts needing to be stretched beyond one episode, which can be both a good or bad thing depending on whether you mind cliffhangers or not))\\n\\n\r\nNeither epic nor horrible --a series that one can check out if you have the spare time to spare. But it's not a great loss if you don't check it out. \\n",

            "content": "This show is about a high school student named Yakumo who has the ability to see spirits with his left red eye and sometimes communicate with them(not a super original premise, but highly entertaining nontheless). He spends his spare time tricking kids out of their money with fake card tricks, or just sleeping about. But, once in a while, he'll take a spirit associated police case that has piqued his interest. But with his troubled family past and issues with humanity, will Yakumo ever be able to live a normal life?\r\nSTORY: (9/10)\r\nWhile not an entirely original premise, they definitely utilized it to it's full potential,much more effectively than many other similar shows. The story basically has everything a good anime needs: A complex main character with a troubled background, a helpful and insightful love interest, a devoted detective, and ghosts. Really, that's all they needed here, but they added even more into the mix to give it an added level of depth and enjoyability.\\n\\n\r\nYakumo's disturbed background piqued my interest in him, and also apparently the interest of those around him. But the best part isn't when they discuss Yakumo, but when Yakumo discusses with the accused how he knows that they are guilty. With pounds of accurate speculation, Yakumo presents his inner monologue better than even Yagami Light of Death Note.\\n\\n\r\nHe solves murders, abductions, and even poltergheist possesion, making for an interesting watch.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say, it suits the series. It's dark and forboding when it's supposed to be, and bright and happy when it's supposed to be. Also, although not littered with fight scenes, when they pop up in Shinrei Tantei Yakumo, it looks damn realistic. The character designs aren't the most original I've ever seen, but I suppose that look best suits their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to animation, this show did it right.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, the opening theme represents the show so well I was actually considering making this review simply a link to it on YouTube or something. The opening theme is truly fitting, and the ending just as much so. The voice acting was just as it should be to match the theme of the show, and the background noise/music was never out of place.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, a 2010 show did animation and sound well.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: (9.5/10)\\n\\n\r\nAlthough sometimes the main love interest (Haruka) can be absent minded occasionally, every other character plays their role perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nBoth of Yakumo's parents are dead, and he has always been shunned or even beaten up due to his red left eye.\\n\\n\r\nLater you find out that Yakumo and Haruka's past goes back further then either of them thought, giving their relationship and added level of depth.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I absolutely love about their relationship though is that there is no stupid blushing, and the girl is simply trying to help the guy, which is a refreshing change of pace seeing as most anime series these days have the protagonist being an emotionally immature nitwit who freaks out at the sight of anything related to women.\\n\\n\r\nIn this show, Yakumo doesn't express any feelings for her at all, and instead simply allows her to tag along, while she is trying to help him in dealing with his troubled past. It's obvious they are concerned about eachother and harbor feelings, but the best part is that it's successfully conveyed without either character being awkward or embarassed in any way.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters also offer comic relief and intel on future missions, as well as being occasionally super adorable(I just wanna give his deaf little cousin a hug for being so cute",

            "content": "I often visit Anime44 and browse through the recent releases. I spotted Psychic Detective and the cover art struck me. I read the synopsis and I had to admit that I thought it sounded a bit plain, but something was telling me to watch it. After a few weeks of procrastinating and reading comments from the watchers, I half-heartedly started the first episode. Needless to say, I only got as far as the opening that day (was very busy). But the opening was very unique. Still, I wasn't convinced. \r\nFinally, I pushed myself and watched the first episode. My first thought about the main characterswas that Haruka reminded me of the chick from Eureka 7 and the guy was the typical shoujo guy. A lot of the characters had the same names as the characters from Hakuouki, which was interesting. \\n\\n\r\nAfter I finished the first episode, I found myself watching the second, and the third, and so on. Now I honestly think I'm hooked. \\n\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, the story isn't the most amazing thing I've ever seen. It doesn't have one focus plotline throughout the series, merely just a problem that they solve within the episode etc. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThere are some parts that I favored in the series. The part when Haruka is thrown into the river to drown and Yakumo doesn't hesitate to go after her. The part when Haruka stops Yakumo from throwing his mother's necklace into the river, and the scene where she finds him tied to the chair after being kidnapped by his father's accomplice and confesses to him, thinking he is dead. Those scene's seemed to hold the most emotion and character development for me. Even so, my inner masochist wanted them to torture Haruka in front of Yakumo to see his reaction because you can almost never tell what he is feeling, especially toward her.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime an 8. :)\\n\\n\\n",

Watching one episode makes you want to watch the next, and the next, and so on. Just when things seem predictable, it ends up twisting a smidge. But, each episode either repeats the same routine, or is a continuation of the previous episode. Since this series has only 13 episodes, you don't grow tired of it. Like I mentioned before, there are twists, and it'll keep you hooked till the very end.\r\nScore: 10\r\nThe Art: The art was perfect. It has a balance to it. The important scenes wereput some effort into, while the less imporant scenes were put less effort into. The important scenes were simply emphasized---which was good. It sorts out which parts were needed to be remembered and which were not needed to be. Simple.\\n\r\nScore: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound: The sound of the cars stopping, speeding up, and halting while going at a high speed---all were dynamic. [Footsteps, someone running up behind you, a gun being pulled out, the sound of a taser----amazing.] \\n\r\nScore: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: Each character had their own purpose, personality, and something that made them unique, still fitting the mood. Many characters were relatable. For example, Yakumo----he doesn't really open up much, independent, and at most times, mysterious. You probably have a friend like that. This anime has a few morals, figured out by almost every character.\\n\r\nScore: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment: I finished this anime in 1 day. It was gripping. Curse my curiosity!! But, I enjoyed every bit of it, still maintaining full focus throughout the estimate of 6-7 hours of watching this unforgettable anime series. I felt like I was a ghost following along the \"gang\".\\n\r\nScore: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI loved Shinrei Tantei Yakumo. Distant and Distinct characters are the best, because when they unravel, it's certainly undescribable. \u2665\\n\\n",

Also, we've got a normal girl who has a sad past who's intrigued by the skills of this guy. Plus, we've got random characters who accompany these two.\r\nAnyway, beside the simple storyline, it is very well thought out and planned. For example, as each episode goes on, more and more is revealed about Yakumo's past. The experiences that each character faces are extremely well done. The elements of this anime is very well thought of and disaplayed.\r\nArt:\r\nI thought thepeople who drew this anime was awesome. The way who each character looks is fantastic and they are all very good looking.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI'd have to say the music in this drama is amazing. The opening song is appealing and the ending song is so sweet. Not to mention, the background music is beyond awesome. I have to admit, the background music really made me interested and appeal to this anime. Why? Well, the music creates an even more dramatic entrance to the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters are really obviously layed out. There's the smart and cold guy with a mysterious past, the clumsy tag-along heroine, the smoker detective who hides his feelings behind a tough guy look, the clumsy apprentice, the one who's saved but still tags along on adventures, the gentle father figure, and, lastly, the enemy who is only interested in one thing.\\n\r\nBut, overall, I liked each of the characters. I thought they played a great role in the storyline of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. It was inspirational and very interesting. I had fun watching it and was very disappointed that it had to end early. Yet, I know I'll rewatch it numerous times.",

            "content": "Having seen 9 episodes I have finished the first story arc which was three episodes long, this last arc was in stark contrast to the usual single layered plots we've been getting throughout the series. I loved the first episode it really showed promise, after that the show pretty much established itself as mediocre, the scope of what it could have been is limitless though, the characters are likeable (if not a tad typical - but hey its hard to have completely original characters nowadays). Yakumo is a lazy, unapproachable uni student with an emo attitude - I think they're trying to turn him intothe male version of a tsundere. Haruka the female lead is pretty, full of life, and in love with Yakumo. Gotou is the series' typical detective, the type who wears the same clothes all day and doesn't seem efficient at first glance but he gets the job done - he often relies on yakumo's help to solve cases (as yakumo can see spirits). The art is wonderful, it gives the show a dark atmosphere in exactly the way it should. The art is probably the best thing about the show in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nSeries with episodic plots ARE NOT ALL BAD some have been EPIC look no further than bebop, darker than black s1, or katanagatari. For me yakumo is lacking the same flair those shows had, after the first episode I wasn't sucked in and during the melodramatic multiepisode arc I didn't find myself on the edge of my seat I  found myself not caring. I give this show 7/10 unless something good happens between now and when the show ends. Sadly this was a show with the makings of death note 2.0 but it is a chance that has been wasted by story writers not wanting to experiment with novel stories instead they are content with a supernatural version of CSI - think ghost whisperer or true calling - tried and tested formulas.",

            "content": "Shinrei Tantei Yakumo is a shoujo series based on a series of light novels by Kaminaga Manabu. It's had two manga adaptations, the second of which is still going. In 2010 it got an anime adaptation from Bee Train. Not long ago we looked at their work with Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom and I've also looked at Murder Princess. So, they're two for two so far. Of course, this is the first thing I've reviewed from them where they weren't co-producing. Still, let's see if they can make it three for three and give me something good to close out the month. \r\nStory:\r\nOzawa Harukahas a problem. After she and some friends went inside a forbidden building, one has committed suicide and another is in hospital, possessed by spirits. Haruka seeks out the help of Saitou Yakumo, a supposedly psychic boy at her University. Yakumo agrees saying that he can see spirits and might be able to persuade them to leave her friend. Over the course of that investigation, Haruka discovers that Yakumo can, indeed, see ghosts and that his left eye is actually red. From there, the two keep finding themselves involved in more mysteries involving spirits. Meanwhile, a shadow is closing in on them that's intimately connected with Yakumo's past. Can the two of them stay alive and find the truth? \\n\\n\r\nLet's start by discussing the weaknesses of the series. In this case, the big one is the mysteries themselves. Most of them have answers that are made really obvious to the audience through the use of really unsubtle hints or, in some cases, by the series actively showing you who's responsible. Which just leaves you to see how the characters are going to figure them out and makes the investigation portions a bit lacklustre. There's also the romance betwixt Haruka and Yakumo. While it does have some good moments here and there, it's also pretty static. Haruka develops an obvious crush on Yakumo really quickly and then the two of them hang out a lot, in spite of his seeming disinterest. From there, it moves at a really slow pace. There are some hints that he also has feelings for her, especially towards the end, but nothing gets done with it and, ultimately, it comes across as more of an excuse to keep her in the story than a serious attempt at writing romance. There are a couple moments that are a bit nonsensical too. For example, there's a scene where Haruka is in a car and its driver can't move. Rather than climbing over him to hit the brake, she just settles for steering. There aren't many moments like that, but the ones they have are really head-scratching. \\n\\n\r\nLet's move on to the positive factors of the series. The first is that the world is built really well and there are defined rules for what ghosts can and can't do. It's not one of those vague things where it bends and shifts based on plot convenience. The series is paced really well and it is interesting to see how the characters solve the mysteries even if the audience has already been handed the answer. The series is also good about showing the plot elements that it's going to use in the climax early on while using those elements in a way that it feels very unique and is actually compelling. Tension is used  effectively in the series and its portrayals of sexual assault are respectfully done. They're told through description rather than actually shown but they have a lot of weight to them and they're actually relevant to the story instead of being thrown in. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well written. They have a good level of complexity and they do come across as actual people. Crazy people, in some cases, but not in an exaggerated or forced way. There are some really compelling dynamics in the series as well both friendly and antagonistic. On the down side, I will say that the way that Detective Gotou's character ultimately develops is a bit contrived. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nTaken as a whole, the character designs and animation are quite good. The backgrounds are nicely detailed as well and the supernatural effects are visually interesting. The biggest fault with the artwork is that, like they did in Phantom, Bee Train mistakes putting their animation at an odd angle for intensity. Showing someone slanted diagonally isn't more intense nor does it make the scene more dynamic, it's just annoying. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThis series has a strong cast. Ono Daisuke gives a strong performance in the leading role. Fujimura Ayumi does well as Haruka. Takase Akimitsu makes quite a villain. Touchi Hiroki is good and, I really have to give credit to Koshimizu Ami, the voice of the young deaf girl, Nao. She does an amazing job conveying the thoughts and emotions of a character who communicates entirely in grunts without a single line of actual dialogue. I knew she was a good actress from hearing her performances as Claes in Gunslinger Girl, Alita in Murder Princess and Holo the wise wolf, but this was a really difficult role and she aces it beyond what I would have expected. The music isn't as strong as the cast. It's all right but nothing that really grabs you. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay: \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't any. The closest it gets is that there's a period where Gotou thinks his partner, Ishii, might be romantically attracted to him. This causes things to be awkward for a while as Gotou freaks out. I can't fault the series for lack of realism, since there are plenty of blokes who freak out about the idea that another bloke might be into them, but it's a pretty stupid reaction. Just tell him you aren't interested if he confesses. Chances are very high that he'll understand and accept it. It's not like you have to give him a good long snog just because he expresses interest. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: \\n\\n\r\nShinrei Tantei Yakumo is a solid series. It certainly has some issues that detract from it, but in spite of those it has a compelling narrative, strong characters, a great cast and good artwork. Overall, I rate this one a 7/10. It is a good series. Next week, I'll take a look at the final instalment of the Kara no Kyoukai films. Have a happy Halloween in the interim.",

            "content": "\u201cI see the spirits of the dead. We can even communicate with one another. To be clear, I don\u2019t have the power to purify or exorcise. I can only see them.\u201d \u2013Saitou Yakumo\r\nThat quote completely describes the beauty of Yakumo\u2019s power. Because of his cursed red eye, he can see the spirits of the dead. But he cannot touch them, purify them, or exorcise them. He can only speak to them. This is a cause for internal conflict for him, and what a heart-wrenching process that is.\r\nOne of Shinrei Tantei Yakumo\u2019s strong points is its story. It is not completely original, but it is appealingand well-written. Everything in the plot is utilized to its full potential. Combine this with good pacing and foreshadowing, and an intriguing plot is created. The set-up is slightly repetitive, but only slightly, and will be familiar to those who revel in the detective genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe style of the art isn\u2019t particularly ground-breaking, original, or gorgeous, but it\u2019s well done. It definitely has some beautiful moments. Everything is pleasing to the eyes and the animation is smooth. Character designs aren\u2019t the most original, but they do what they\u2019re meant to.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m personally very fond of the music in this anime. It, again, fits the mood of the anime. It never feels like it doesn\u2019t belong. The OP is beautifully haunting; the ED soothes you after a cliffhanger. OSTs are very nice, and all of the music is unique. The voice acting sounds good.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also pleasing. Everyone has their place in the anime, and all of the characters are lovable. Yakumo is a wonderful character; his emotions are real and he acts the way that he does for an apparent, and heart-wrenching, reason. Because of his red eye, he has been shunned, but yet you can always see that, deep down, he has a beautiful and pure heart.\\n\\n\r\nThe love interest, Haruka, is often clueless, but genuinely nice. She has strength, a big heart, and an adorable relationship with Yakumo. It\u2019s apparent that she really wants to help him. Their relationship, though it doesn\u2019t develop into anything huge, does grow in a really sweet, convincing way.\\n\\n\r\nSupporting characters are equally lovable, and though they aren\u2019t developed as much, they have wonderful moments and are never just tossed to the side.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Shinrei Tantei Yakumo is a good anime that is certainly worth a watch. I recommend the ongoing manga to any fans (or half-hearted fans) of this series. It exceeds all expectations in character development, plot, and art, and is eager to please.",

While the anime might not be the best out there it has certainty from start to finish been  a pleasure to watch and has become one of my favourites.\r\nStory:8/10\r\nThe Story revols around Yakumo and the use of his red eye which can see the spirts of the dead. The story is done well and while most of the series is episodic the overarching story is well done.The only criticism is that some of the episodes are a bit to fast passed for me but others may like that.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8/10\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is or a decent quality for a 2010 anime and while it is not as good as some anime you see nowadays it has its charm. The characters are done well and the scenes are also done well with the things like the spirits easily distinguished from the rest of the scene. Also the actions scenes are done well. Also the opening and closing animation is really good and fits the whole shows dark tone and spirit/ghost look on things.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9/10\\n\r\nThe sound for me is a high point as the sound fits every scene well and it contributes to what you are watching, whether it is an action scene or an emotional scene the music is done well to fit the show. The voice actors also do a good job. The Openings and Endings are also very memorable and very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:9/10\\n\r\nThe characters in the show are done well and the mains have good characteristics to seperate them from others and to make them enjoyable to watch. The supporting cast are also brilliant, and while they are done well it would have been nice if some of them were given a bit more character development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10\\n\r\nThis show was enjoyable all the way through. The story was done well so that I could be engaged for all the 12 episodes and the characters were also enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOveral Verdict:9/10\\n\r\nThis show is great. While some episodes were a bit to fast pased for me, some of the characters were not developed as much as I wanted and the art was not the best of quality, the show made all 12 episodes enjoyable, the art was, even though not of best quality, good enough to want to watch in HD, the sound/music was brilliant, the openings and closing themes and animations were brilliant and the cast of characters kept me interested in a story that was done well and was enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are put of this anime, because it is not that popular and doesnt have the hightest average score, please don't be as it is fantastic and you won't regret it and it is easily one of my favourite animes of all time.",

            "content": "Psychic Detective Yakumo \r\n13 episodes of unexpected (mostly) twists and turns down a dark alley of paranormal mystery. The storytellers pack quite a lot into those 13 episodes. The focus begins on the two main characters and deftly brings in other characters, expanding the viewers knowledge of their friends and family, while at the same time giving us a broader, more insightful, look into Yakumo and Haruka. \r\nThe usual tropes are there, but there are reasons these tropes are used over and over again. When done right, they make for good story telling. \r\nYakumo is the tragic, good looking hero who just needs the loveof a good heroine to put him on the path of righteousness and, of course, happiness. \\n\r\nHaruka is the naive, heedless of her own beauty and charm, heart of gold, but courageous of spirit, young woman, who finds herself drawn into our hero\u2019s world. Both hero and heroine are forever changed. \\n\r\nGood overcomes evil, love overcomes hate, but what happens in between, and is told in the 13 episodes, is definitely worth watching. \\n\r\nThe story has a great buildup of seemingly unrelated cases that begin to intertwine and mesh into each other in unexpected and delightfully twisted ways. There are places where one does guess accurately what will happen but then the show will surprise you when you least expect it. Don\u2019t be surprised if a gasp or two escapes you while watching. \\n\r\nThere are a few areas that I did find lacking, but certainly not enough to detract from the enjoyment I took in watching the series. I\u2019m not certain if the intention was to do more than one season or not and they may have been planning to fill in or fix those areas at a later date. \\n\r\nThe villain, while suitably evil, was not a satisfying villain. They were more of a caricature of evil than something or someone to truly fear. The story, in my opinion, would have been better served if we had learned more about the motives and history of the villain\u2014something to flesh them out, so to speak. \\n\r\nThe last episode was done well in that, if it was the last episode it would be fairly wrapped up with a few loose ends so that if a second season were coming they could build on it. \\n\r\nOverall, I loved this series. If you like mystery, romance and a good story, you need to check this out.",

            "content": "Overall, this is a good anime to pass the time. Or in my case, it's a break from a long anime like KHR. If you liked Ghost Hunt, you'd enjoy this too! The more I watch, the more I feel the similarities between GH and Shinrei Tantei Yakumo. \r\nStory:\r\nAn anime adapted from a novel, again like GH. The idea isn't exactly original, but the storyline is. Because it's a short 13 ep season, some of the plots are quite fast-paced. Depending on personal preference, it may be too rushed for some, but it's just right that it doesn't bore or leave you behind in dust.There is a nice blend of supernatural and detective, with a tinge of romance in it. A word of warning though, if you're going for sappiness, you will be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nYes, there are plenty of unanswered questions and mystery, mostly regarding the Red-eyed man who's supposedly Yakumo's father. Though since the novel is still on-going, we can hope for possible second season (: \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really pleasant to the eye. Okay.. I'm a fan of red-eyed bishies. That aside, I'm not expecting huge, explosive reactions, but the lack of expression of the characters bothered me a little. The characters are also a tad too flat and stuck in the background. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI loved the OST! In fact, I got it after the first episode. The song \"White Wing\" is one of my favourites. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nHm, they were all the usual characters you'd find in similar animes; Yakumo's the cold, unsociable guy with a reason for acting as so; Haruka the friendly, cute girl who accepts Yakumo for who he is; Ishiin the understanding uncle who wish for Yakumo's happiness, Gotou the rough but really caring friend; Ishii the side-kick who's clumsy and a coward, who decided to face his fears for his friend. \\n\\n\r\nI still love the characters despite their typicality, because they do develop and grow along the way. And the seiyuus definitely did justice to them!! \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I cannot help but get reminded of L from Death Note and Naru from Ghost Hunt when I watch it. Yakumo reminds me too much of the both of them! His dressing and personality wise!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\n7/10. It's definitely worth your time if you like animes from similar genres (: But you probably want to skip it if you hate endings with tons of unanswered questions.",

            "content": "I will refer to the series being reviewed as Psychic Detective Yakumo. I watched this to try and alleviate my boredem. The synopsis will not be typed here for obvious reasons. This is just my opinion and attitude towards this series. \r\nThis series is suppose to be a horror but I have no recollection of being scared, nervous, alarmed or even startled while watching Psychic Detective Yakumo. The ghosts were more of a joke than terrifying really. They come off as people's shadows . Could you please just for the sake of this review try to scare someone you know by standing still and askingthem to look at your shadow whenever you have free time. The episodic structure of the show is a chance for this show to tell refreshing stories that improve on the previous episode, but it is the exact same formula over and over and over again. Girl asks psychic for help on a potential case, psychic insults girl, detective that the psychic helps and vice versa becomes involved in the case and the trio set off to solve the mystery. After a few episodes watching became more of a chore. There is no unpredictablity and the writing is just flat. How can I get rid of this ghost? Why don't I try the exact same method I used the previous week. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are complete strangers to the viewer with no real development. The only characters that I really cared for was detective Gotou and Isshhin Saito but they can't really save this series from being the exact oppisite the creators were trying to achieve. You will read about this in a lot of reviews but it's still a complaint from my side: The villian is a complete alien. You get that type of my kids should stay away from that guy whenever possible vibe but he does not live up to his full potetntial. His goals are never stated which means everytime the show cuts him you have to squeeze interest out of yourself to listen to something that may or may not have something to to do with the plot. If you hear what everybody calls him in the series you will realize exactly how uninteresting and stale this weirdo is. The romantic plot that that makes up alot of the show's \"story\" goes nowhere. I was really expecting something , anything. I have to listen to whining and arguing between two people I dont give a damn for for 13 episodes. Give me something,anything!\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is run-of-the-mill voice acting with the exception of the most intersting characters Gotou and Isshhin. My cousin told me he realized that a lot of voice actors speak with a mono tones when they have to dub anime to english. This is the exact case with Yakumo. When he is supposedly shocked or sad yo just hear that mono tone (a lot like Edward's tone of voice from Twilight). The OP  is terrible. If you can classify under what type of music this falls under please let me know (I only listened to it for about 10 seconds).The ending theme was actually beautiful,it is that type of song you can understand without speaking the language it is performed in.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was alright. It's not like Dragonball where everyone is drawn according to Asian sterotyping,you know that saying . These characters have looks that fit what liitle personality they have perfectly. The backgrounds are okay and the ghost are just \"meh\".\\n\\n\r\nThe show was alright at the beginning but went to make my weekend feel a lot longer and declined after just 2 episodes. I have to admit I liked the ending, I'm a sucker for stuff like that and because the experience was over. Here's what I thought about the show:\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Gotou and Isshhin\\n\r\n-Ending theme  \\n\r\n-Ending\\n\r\n-Art was alright\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Everything else\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5/10\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\\n",

This made it very easy to picture myself in the situations.\r\nThe only thing I missed in the story was a huge plot twist, because, even though there were some unexpected events, I wasn't put completely off track all at once. However, I did very much enjoy trying to solve the puzzles they're solving in this detective anime.\r\nAnother thing I liked, was the art: it showed a lot of detail.\r\nOne of the details, by example, is the pupils of Yakumo. If you closely you can seea round pupil in his green eye, but the one is his red eye is more cat like, making it more inhuman.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is probably the best thing in the whole anime: there was character development! Oh, do I love character development...\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the combination of mystery with some supernatural, good art and character development made this a good anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt is the kind of anime you can watch in a very short amount of time, really enjoy, but don't have to become all obsessed over, which is a nice thing, if you have too much too fangirl/fanboy about already in your life like me.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, just go watch it.",

The only thing i don't like about this anime as a boy is that it's also shojou... I never noticed it until the day i read it here. And that makesme sad because Shinreitantei Yakumo is nothing boys can't watch or read! I wonder why it's shojou because i read the light novel and the novel is not shojou...

            "content": "'Shinrei Tantei Yakumo' ('Psychic Detective Yakumo') is about Yakumo, an university student and private detective, who has a red left eye that lets him see ghosts and spirits.\r\nThe premise and atmosphere of this show is very similar to 'Ghost Hunt', just that the good guys have no offensive super powers, and the ghosts and spirits are directly harmless. The basic format of the show begins with Haruka asking Yakumo to investigate on a case, he takes a look at the scene, ask for help from allies (police detectives, journalist, priest etc), and puts the spirits at ease after a showdown. At the same time, thereis another parallel story of a group of villains watching Yakumo's move and plotting a evil scheme.\\n\\n\r\nThe introduction was done very well, the characters seemed very interesting, but it seemed to be downhill from there instead of picking up in pace and intensity.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I liked about the story was that it focuses on human beings despite being a show about ghosts. Instead of senseless showcase of super powers, Yakumo and company actually trace back the problems like a real detective, and also focuses on the issue of discrimination he faces for being different. The problem was that none of the cases were particularly interesting nor memorable, and the showdowns are rather anticlimatic. Even the main and final case was severely underdeveloped, as we still don't know the reason \"red eyed man\" became a spirit, why he had the ghost-seeing red eyes, or his relationship with Yakumo and his mother other than the obvious. Painfully slow pacing certainly did not help.\\n\r\nOf course, we're left with an open ending that explains nothing, and starved for another season.\\n\\n\r\nYakumo was an interesting character though, with a complex and painful past that's gradually revealed to us as we follow the cases he was assigned by Haruka. I particularly liked how his antisocial personality was explained by his past and ghost-seeing eye that enabled him to see things others can't. Unfortunately, Haruka existed mostly to set up the case and an attempt to add a little romance to the story. Their chemistry was rather poor, and she rarely play any significant role in solving the cases or development of the protagonist. She was also portrayed as an extremely dumb girl just to demonstrate how smart Yakumo is compared to an ordinary person.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt style was very generic, but the backgrounds had a nice atmosphere. The characters seemed disturbingly flat though. I can't quite put my finger to why it is so, but if I had to guess, it was either awkward shading or lack of detail despite realistic design.\\n\r\nThe presentation was also very boring, standard still camera or slowly moving screens.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBGM was rather good for this series. Sets the creepy mood well, and some sound really touching or melancholic. Unfortunately, the story was nowhere near engaging, and could not take advantage of the music. It also lacked variety, as if every scary scenes had the same song, one for touching scenes, and another mysterious theme.\\n\r\nNo complaints for voicing, everyone sound they should and performed average or better in my opinion.\\n\r\nOP is rather original with the song that sets the mysterious mood for the show, ED was rather ordinary.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI hate to use this word to describe a series, but there's no other way... dull. 'Shinrei Tantei Yakumo' had a strong introduction and all the ingredients to make it a great show, but it just didn't live up to its potential. There's no eye candy since action was very limited, the story lacked suspense despite being a mystery, and the presentation was boring.\\n\\n\r\nIt turned out to be yet another bland forgettable mystery anime. \\n\\n",

Through his eye, Yakumo is able to see and communicate with spirits of the dead, helping them move on from their earthly dwelling. \r\nThe events unfold in an episodic format familiar to detective series fans, giving STY the double effect of being easy to follow while having a tendency to be repetitive. Personally, though, I liked the format. Despite the mini-cases, the plot still followed the main conflict, which is big and complex and absolutely mind-boggling. Technically, the art is so-so, but the sound is fantastic. BGM is perfectly timedand gives just the right feeling. \\n\\n\r\nI love this show for its complex plot, and its excellent script. (You know those cheesy lines you only get out of detective stories with psychological drama tendencies?) I hate it for what I feel is its lack of attention on character development, given we only ever hear about Yakumo's life and nobody else's. Oh yes, and the stories aren't scary at all. \\n\\n\r\nShinrei Tantei Yakumo is recommended for lovers of old-style detective mysteries and ghost stories. Although there's admittedly less of the latter than the title implies. It's really just a police story with a paranormal flavor.",

(And this pattern has stayed consistent on the episodes I've seen so far...)\r\nObviously, with a pattern like this one or all of the three has to be sacrificed and we end up with a mystery per episode that is neither challenging to us nor expanded well on. Just a plain \"oh here's an issue, here's -briefly- what the characters did, and here's the solution.\"\r\nIt's not abad formula but for people who are expecting/wanting a more dramatic or drawn out mystery, it might not quench your thirst.\\n\r\nThe nice thing this series does (so far) is that despite the rather short \"character development\" segments it is done rather cleverly and leaves you a little curious about more and whether they'll have a bigger role later. Same can be said about the segments that seem to \"foreshadow something bigger\" except they are even shorter and may prove more of a tease than anything.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, so far it's an average standard show, it doesn't have a crazy \"cliffhanger ending\" pacing nor is it so slow you wished the episodes would air faster. \\n\\n\r\n((Edit/Note: in the later part of the series the pattern has changed so that character/background development has become a bigger part of the episodes-- however this results in the \"mystery per episode\" parts needing to be stretched beyond one episode, which can be both a good or bad thing depending on whether you mind cliffhangers or not))\\n\\n\r\nNeither epic nor horrible --a series that one can check out if you have the spare time to spare. But it's not a great loss if you don't check it out. \\n",

            "content": "This show is about a high school student named Yakumo who has the ability to see spirits with his left red eye and sometimes communicate with them(not a super original premise, but highly entertaining nontheless). He spends his spare time tricking kids out of their money with fake card tricks, or just sleeping about. But, once in a while, he'll take a spirit associated police case that has piqued his interest. But with his troubled family past and issues with humanity, will Yakumo ever be able to live a normal life?\r\nSTORY: (9/10)\r\nWhile not an entirely original premise, they definitely utilized it to it's full potential,much more effectively than many other similar shows. The story basically has everything a good anime needs: A complex main character with a troubled background, a helpful and insightful love interest, a devoted detective, and ghosts. Really, that's all they needed here, but they added even more into the mix to give it an added level of depth and enjoyability.\\n\\n\r\nYakumo's disturbed background piqued my interest in him, and also apparently the interest of those around him. But the best part isn't when they discuss Yakumo, but when Yakumo discusses with the accused how he knows that they are guilty. With pounds of accurate speculation, Yakumo presents his inner monologue better than even Yagami Light of Death Note.\\n\\n\r\nHe solves murders, abductions, and even poltergheist possesion, making for an interesting watch.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say, it suits the series. It's dark and forboding when it's supposed to be, and bright and happy when it's supposed to be. Also, although not littered with fight scenes, when they pop up in Shinrei Tantei Yakumo, it looks damn realistic. The character designs aren't the most original I've ever seen, but I suppose that look best suits their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to animation, this show did it right.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, the opening theme represents the show so well I was actually considering making this review simply a link to it on YouTube or something. The opening theme is truly fitting, and the ending just as much so. The voice acting was just as it should be to match the theme of the show, and the background noise/music was never out of place.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, a 2010 show did animation and sound well.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: (9.5/10)\\n\\n\r\nAlthough sometimes the main love interest (Haruka) can be absent minded occasionally, every other character plays their role perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nBoth of Yakumo's parents are dead, and he has always been shunned or even beaten up due to his red left eye.\\n\\n\r\nLater you find out that Yakumo and Haruka's past goes back further then either of them thought, giving their relationship and added level of depth.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I absolutely love about their relationship though is that there is no stupid blushing, and the girl is simply trying to help the guy, which is a refreshing change of pace seeing as most anime series these days have the protagonist being an emotionally immature nitwit who freaks out at the sight of anything related to women.\\n\\n\r\nIn this show, Yakumo doesn't express any feelings for her at all, and instead simply allows her to tag along, while she is trying to help him in dealing with his troubled past. It's obvious they are concerned about eachother and harbor feelings, but the best part is that it's successfully conveyed without either character being awkward or embarassed in any way.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters also offer comic relief and intel on future missions, as well as being occasionally super adorable(I just wanna give his deaf little cousin a hug for being so cute",

            "content": "I often visit Anime44 and browse through the recent releases. I spotted Psychic Detective and the cover art struck me. I read the synopsis and I had to admit that I thought it sounded a bit plain, but something was telling me to watch it. After a few weeks of procrastinating and reading comments from the watchers, I half-heartedly started the first episode. Needless to say, I only got as far as the opening that day (was very busy). But the opening was very unique. Still, I wasn't convinced. \r\nFinally, I pushed myself and watched the first episode. My first thought about the main characterswas that Haruka reminded me of the chick from Eureka 7 and the guy was the typical shoujo guy. A lot of the characters had the same names as the characters from Hakuouki, which was interesting. \\n\\n\r\nAfter I finished the first episode, I found myself watching the second, and the third, and so on. Now I honestly think I'm hooked. \\n\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, the story isn't the most amazing thing I've ever seen. It doesn't have one focus plotline throughout the series, merely just a problem that they solve within the episode etc. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThere are some parts that I favored in the series. The part when Haruka is thrown into the river to drown and Yakumo doesn't hesitate to go after her. The part when Haruka stops Yakumo from throwing his mother's necklace into the river, and the scene where she finds him tied to the chair after being kidnapped by his father's accomplice and confesses to him, thinking he is dead. Those scene's seemed to hold the most emotion and character development for me. Even so, my inner masochist wanted them to torture Haruka in front of Yakumo to see his reaction because you can almost never tell what he is feeling, especially toward her.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give this anime an 8. :)\\n\\n\\n",

Watching one episode makes you want to watch the next, and the next, and so on. Just when things seem predictable, it ends up twisting a smidge. But, each episode either repeats the same routine, or is a continuation of the previous episode. Since this series has only 13 episodes, you don't grow tired of it. Like I mentioned before, there are twists, and it'll keep you hooked till the very end.\r\nScore: 10\r\nThe Art: The art was perfect. It has a balance to it. The important scenes wereput some effort into, while the less imporant scenes were put less effort into. The important scenes were simply emphasized---which was good. It sorts out which parts were needed to be remembered and which were not needed to be. Simple.\\n\r\nScore: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound: The sound of the cars stopping, speeding up, and halting while going at a high speed---all were dynamic. [Footsteps, someone running up behind you, a gun being pulled out, the sound of a taser----amazing.] \\n\r\nScore: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters: Each character had their own purpose, personality, and something that made them unique, still fitting the mood. Many characters were relatable. For example, Yakumo----he doesn't really open up much, independent, and at most times, mysterious. You probably have a friend like that. This anime has a few morals, figured out by almost every character.\\n\r\nScore: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment: I finished this anime in 1 day. It was gripping. Curse my curiosity!! But, I enjoyed every bit of it, still maintaining full focus throughout the estimate of 6-7 hours of watching this unforgettable anime series. I felt like I was a ghost following along the \"gang\".\\n\r\nScore: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI loved Shinrei Tantei Yakumo. Distant and Distinct characters are the best, because when they unravel, it's certainly undescribable. \u2665\\n\\n",

Also, we've got a normal girl who has a sad past who's intrigued by the skills of this guy. Plus, we've got random characters who accompany these two.\r\nAnyway, beside the simple storyline, it is very well thought out and planned. For example, as each episode goes on, more and more is revealed about Yakumo's past. The experiences that each character faces are extremely well done. The elements of this anime is very well thought of and disaplayed.\r\nArt:\r\nI thought thepeople who drew this anime was awesome. The way who each character looks is fantastic and they are all very good looking.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI'd have to say the music in this drama is amazing. The opening song is appealing and the ending song is so sweet. Not to mention, the background music is beyond awesome. I have to admit, the background music really made me interested and appeal to this anime. Why? Well, the music creates an even more dramatic entrance to the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters are really obviously layed out. There's the smart and cold guy with a mysterious past, the clumsy tag-along heroine, the smoker detective who hides his feelings behind a tough guy look, the clumsy apprentice, the one who's saved but still tags along on adventures, the gentle father figure, and, lastly, the enemy who is only interested in one thing.\\n\r\nBut, overall, I liked each of the characters. I thought they played a great role in the storyline of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. It was inspirational and very interesting. I had fun watching it and was very disappointed that it had to end early. Yet, I know I'll rewatch it numerous times.",

            "content": "Having seen 9 episodes I have finished the first story arc which was three episodes long, this last arc was in stark contrast to the usual single layered plots we've been getting throughout the series. I loved the first episode it really showed promise, after that the show pretty much established itself as mediocre, the scope of what it could have been is limitless though, the characters are likeable (if not a tad typical - but hey its hard to have completely original characters nowadays). Yakumo is a lazy, unapproachable uni student with an emo attitude - I think they're trying to turn him intothe male version of a tsundere. Haruka the female lead is pretty, full of life, and in love with Yakumo. Gotou is the series' typical detective, the type who wears the same clothes all day and doesn't seem efficient at first glance but he gets the job done - he often relies on yakumo's help to solve cases (as yakumo can see spirits). The art is wonderful, it gives the show a dark atmosphere in exactly the way it should. The art is probably the best thing about the show in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nSeries with episodic plots ARE NOT ALL BAD some have been EPIC look no further than bebop, darker than black s1, or katanagatari. For me yakumo is lacking the same flair those shows had, after the first episode I wasn't sucked in and during the melodramatic multiepisode arc I didn't find myself on the edge of my seat I  found myself not caring. I give this show 7/10 unless something good happens between now and when the show ends. Sadly this was a show with the makings of death note 2.0 but it is a chance that has been wasted by story writers not wanting to experiment with novel stories instead they are content with a supernatural version of CSI - think ghost whisperer or true calling - tried and tested formulas.",

            "content": "Shinrei Tantei Yakumo is a shoujo series based on a series of light novels by Kaminaga Manabu. It's had two manga adaptations, the second of which is still going. In 2010 it got an anime adaptation from Bee Train. Not long ago we looked at their work with Phantom: Requiem for the Phantom and I've also looked at Murder Princess. So, they're two for two so far. Of course, this is the first thing I've reviewed from them where they weren't co-producing. Still, let's see if they can make it three for three and give me something good to close out the month. \r\nStory:\r\nOzawa Harukahas a problem. After she and some friends went inside a forbidden building, one has committed suicide and another is in hospital, possessed by spirits. Haruka seeks out the help of Saitou Yakumo, a supposedly psychic boy at her University. Yakumo agrees saying that he can see spirits and might be able to persuade them to leave her friend. Over the course of that investigation, Haruka discovers that Yakumo can, indeed, see ghosts and that his left eye is actually red. From there, the two keep finding themselves involved in more mysteries involving spirits. Meanwhile, a shadow is closing in on them that's intimately connected with Yakumo's past. Can the two of them stay alive and find the truth? \\n\\n\r\nLet's start by discussing the weaknesses of the series. In this case, the big one is the mysteries themselves. Most of them have answers that are made really obvious to the audience through the use of really unsubtle hints or, in some cases, by the series actively showing you who's responsible. Which just leaves you to see how the characters are going to figure them out and makes the investigation portions a bit lacklustre. There's also the romance betwixt Haruka and Yakumo. While it does have some good moments here and there, it's also pretty static. Haruka develops an obvious crush on Yakumo really quickly and then the two of them hang out a lot, in spite of his seeming disinterest. From there, it moves at a really slow pace. There are some hints that he also has feelings for her, especially towards the end, but nothing gets done with it and, ultimately, it comes across as more of an excuse to keep her in the story than a serious attempt at writing romance. There are a couple moments that are a bit nonsensical too. For example, there's a scene where Haruka is in a car and its driver can't move. Rather than climbing over him to hit the brake, she just settles for steering. There aren't many moments like that, but the ones they have are really head-scratching. \\n\\n\r\nLet's move on to the positive factors of the series. The first is that the world is built really well and there are defined rules for what ghosts can and can't do. It's not one of those vague things where it bends and shifts based on plot convenience. The series is paced really well and it is interesting to see how the characters solve the mysteries even if the audience has already been handed the answer. The series is also good about showing the plot elements that it's going to use in the climax early on while using those elements in a way that it feels very unique and is actually compelling. Tension is used  effectively in the series and its portrayals of sexual assault are respectfully done. They're told through description rather than actually shown but they have a lot of weight to them and they're actually relevant to the story instead of being thrown in. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well written. They have a good level of complexity and they do come across as actual people. Crazy people, in some cases, but not in an exaggerated or forced way. There are some really compelling dynamics in the series as well both friendly and antagonistic. On the down side, I will say that the way that Detective Gotou's character ultimately develops is a bit contrived. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nTaken as a whole, the character designs and animation are quite good. The backgrounds are nicely detailed as well and the supernatural effects are visually interesting. The biggest fault with the artwork is that, like they did in Phantom, Bee Train mistakes putting their animation at an odd angle for intensity. Showing someone slanted diagonally isn't more intense nor does it make the scene more dynamic, it's just annoying. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThis series has a strong cast. Ono Daisuke gives a strong performance in the leading role. Fujimura Ayumi does well as Haruka. Takase Akimitsu makes quite a villain. Touchi Hiroki is good and, I really have to give credit to Koshimizu Ami, the voice of the young deaf girl, Nao. She does an amazing job conveying the thoughts and emotions of a character who communicates entirely in grunts without a single line of actual dialogue. I knew she was a good actress from hearing her performances as Claes in Gunslinger Girl, Alita in Murder Princess and Holo the wise wolf, but this was a really difficult role and she aces it beyond what I would have expected. The music isn't as strong as the cast. It's all right but nothing that really grabs you. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay: \\n\\n\r\nThere isn't any. The closest it gets is that there's a period where Gotou thinks his partner, Ishii, might be romantically attracted to him. This causes things to be awkward for a while as Gotou freaks out. I can't fault the series for lack of realism, since there are plenty of blokes who freak out about the idea that another bloke might be into them, but it's a pretty stupid reaction. Just tell him you aren't interested if he confesses. Chances are very high that he'll understand and accept it. It's not like you have to give him a good long snog just because he expresses interest. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: \\n\\n\r\nShinrei Tantei Yakumo is a solid series. It certainly has some issues that detract from it, but in spite of those it has a compelling narrative, strong characters, a great cast and good artwork. Overall, I rate this one a 7/10. It is a good series. Next week, I'll take a look at the final instalment of the Kara no Kyoukai films. Have a happy Halloween in the interim.",

I can only see them.\u201d \u2013Saitou Yakumo\r\nThat quote completely describes the beauty of Yakumo\u2019s power. Because of his cursed red eye, he can see the spirits of the dead. But he cannot touch them, purify them, or exorcise them. He can only speak to them. This is a cause for internal conflict for him, and what a heart-wrenching process that is.\r\nOne of Shinrei Tantei Yakumo\u2019s strong points is its story. It is not completely original, but it is appealingand well-written. Everything in the plot is utilized to its full potential. Combine this with good pacing and foreshadowing, and an intriguing plot is created. The set-up is slightly repetitive, but only slightly, and will be familiar to those who revel in the detective genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe style of the art isn\u2019t particularly ground-breaking, original, or gorgeous, but it\u2019s well done. It definitely has some beautiful moments. Everything is pleasing to the eyes and the animation is smooth. Character designs aren\u2019t the most original, but they do what they\u2019re meant to.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m personally very fond of the music in this anime. It, again, fits the mood of the anime. It never feels like it doesn\u2019t belong. The OP is beautifully haunting; the ED soothes you after a cliffhanger. OSTs are very nice, and all of the music is unique. The voice acting sounds good.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also pleasing. Everyone has their place in the anime, and all of the characters are lovable. Yakumo is a wonderful character; his emotions are real and he acts the way that he does for an apparent, and heart-wrenching, reason. Because of his red eye, he has been shunned, but yet you can always see that, deep down, he has a beautiful and pure heart.\\n\\n\r\nThe love interest, Haruka, is often clueless, but genuinely nice. She has strength, a big heart, and an adorable relationship with Yakumo. It\u2019s apparent that she really wants to help him. Their relationship, though it doesn\u2019t develop into anything huge, does grow in a really sweet, convincing way.\\n\\n\r\nSupporting characters are equally lovable, and though they aren\u2019t developed as much, they have wonderful moments and are never just tossed to the side.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Shinrei Tantei Yakumo is a good anime that is certainly worth a watch. I recommend the ongoing manga to any fans (or half-hearted fans) of this series. It exceeds all expectations in character development, plot, and art, and is eager to please.",

While the anime might not be the best out there it has certainty from start to finish been  a pleasure to watch and has become one of my favourites.\r\nStory:8/10\r\nThe Story revols around Yakumo and the use of his red eye which can see the spirts of the dead. The story is done well and while most of the series is episodic the overarching story is well done.The only criticism is that some of the episodes are a bit to fast passed for me but others may like that.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8/10\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is or a decent quality for a 2010 anime and while it is not as good as some anime you see nowadays it has its charm. The characters are done well and the scenes are also done well with the things like the spirits easily distinguished from the rest of the scene. Also the actions scenes are done well. Also the opening and closing animation is really good and fits the whole shows dark tone and spirit/ghost look on things.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9/10\\n\r\nThe sound for me is a high point as the sound fits every scene well and it contributes to what you are watching, whether it is an action scene or an emotional scene the music is done well to fit the show. The voice actors also do a good job. The Openings and Endings are also very memorable and very good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:9/10\\n\r\nThe characters in the show are done well and the mains have good characteristics to seperate them from others and to make them enjoyable to watch. The supporting cast are also brilliant, and while they are done well it would have been nice if some of them were given a bit more character development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10\\n\r\nThis show was enjoyable all the way through. The story was done well so that I could be engaged for all the 12 episodes and the characters were also enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nOveral Verdict:9/10\\n\r\nThis show is great. While some episodes were a bit to fast pased for me, some of the characters were not developed as much as I wanted and the art was not the best of quality, the show made all 12 episodes enjoyable, the art was, even though not of best quality, good enough to want to watch in HD, the sound/music was brilliant, the openings and closing themes and animations were brilliant and the cast of characters kept me interested in a story that was done well and was enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are put of this anime, because it is not that popular and doesnt have the hightest average score, please don't be as it is fantastic and you won't regret it and it is easily one of my favourite animes of all time.",

            "content": "Psychic Detective Yakumo \r\n13 episodes of unexpected (mostly) twists and turns down a dark alley of paranormal mystery. The storytellers pack quite a lot into those 13 episodes. The focus begins on the two main characters and deftly brings in other characters, expanding the viewers knowledge of their friends and family, while at the same time giving us a broader, more insightful, look into Yakumo and Haruka. \r\nThe usual tropes are there, but there are reasons these tropes are used over and over again. When done right, they make for good story telling. \r\nYakumo is the tragic, good looking hero who just needs the loveof a good heroine to put him on the path of righteousness and, of course, happiness. \\n\r\nHaruka is the naive, heedless of her own beauty and charm, heart of gold, but courageous of spirit, young woman, who finds herself drawn into our hero\u2019s world. Both hero and heroine are forever changed. \\n\r\nGood overcomes evil, love overcomes hate, but what happens in between, and is told in the 13 episodes, is definitely worth watching. \\n\r\nThe story has a great buildup of seemingly unrelated cases that begin to intertwine and mesh into each other in unexpected and delightfully twisted ways. There are places where one does guess accurately what will happen but then the show will surprise you when you least expect it. Don\u2019t be surprised if a gasp or two escapes you while watching. \\n\r\nThere are a few areas that I did find lacking, but certainly not enough to detract from the enjoyment I took in watching the series. I\u2019m not certain if the intention was to do more than one season or not and they may have been planning to fill in or fix those areas at a later date. \\n\r\nThe villain, while suitably evil, was not a satisfying villain. They were more of a caricature of evil than something or someone to truly fear. The story, in my opinion, would have been better served if we had learned more about the motives and history of the villain\u2014something to flesh them out, so to speak. \\n\r\nThe last episode was done well in that, if it was the last episode it would be fairly wrapped up with a few loose ends so that if a second season were coming they could build on it. \\n\r\nOverall, I loved this series. If you like mystery, romance and a good story, you need to check this out.",

            "content": "Overall, this is a good anime to pass the time. Or in my case, it's a break from a long anime like KHR. If you liked Ghost Hunt, you'd enjoy this too! The more I watch, the more I feel the similarities between GH and Shinrei Tantei Yakumo. \r\nStory:\r\nAn anime adapted from a novel, again like GH. The idea isn't exactly original, but the storyline is. Because it's a short 13 ep season, some of the plots are quite fast-paced. Depending on personal preference, it may be too rushed for some, but it's just right that it doesn't bore or leave you behind in dust.There is a nice blend of supernatural and detective, with a tinge of romance in it. A word of warning though, if you're going for sappiness, you will be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nYes, there are plenty of unanswered questions and mystery, mostly regarding the Red-eyed man who's supposedly Yakumo's father. Though since the novel is still on-going, we can hope for possible second season (: \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really pleasant to the eye. Okay.. I'm a fan of red-eyed bishies. That aside, I'm not expecting huge, explosive reactions, but the lack of expression of the characters bothered me a little. The characters are also a tad too flat and stuck in the background. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nI loved the OST! In fact, I got it after the first episode. The song \"White Wing\" is one of my favourites. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nHm, they were all the usual characters you'd find in similar animes; Yakumo's the cold, unsociable guy with a reason for acting as so; Haruka the friendly, cute girl who accepts Yakumo for who he is; Ishiin the understanding uncle who wish for Yakumo's happiness, Gotou the rough but really caring friend; Ishii the side-kick who's clumsy and a coward, who decided to face his fears for his friend. \\n\\n\r\nI still love the characters despite their typicality, because they do develop and grow along the way. And the seiyuus definitely did justice to them!! \\n\\n\r\nAlthough I cannot help but get reminded of L from Death Note and Naru from Ghost Hunt when I watch it. Yakumo reminds me too much of the both of them! His dressing and personality wise!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\n7/10. It's definitely worth your time if you like animes from similar genres (: But you probably want to skip it if you hate endings with tons of unanswered questions.",

            "content": "I will refer to the series being reviewed as Psychic Detective Yakumo. I watched this to try and alleviate my boredem. The synopsis will not be typed here for obvious reasons. This is just my opinion and attitude towards this series. \r\nThis series is suppose to be a horror but I have no recollection of being scared, nervous, alarmed or even startled while watching Psychic Detective Yakumo. The ghosts were more of a joke than terrifying really. They come off as people's shadows . Could you please just for the sake of this review try to scare someone you know by standing still and askingthem to look at your shadow whenever you have free time. The episodic structure of the show is a chance for this show to tell refreshing stories that improve on the previous episode, but it is the exact same formula over and over and over again. Girl asks psychic for help on a potential case, psychic insults girl, detective that the psychic helps and vice versa becomes involved in the case and the trio set off to solve the mystery. After a few episodes watching became more of a chore. There is no unpredictablity and the writing is just flat. How can I get rid of this ghost? Why don't I try the exact same method I used the previous week. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are complete strangers to the viewer with no real development. The only characters that I really cared for was detective Gotou and Isshhin Saito but they can't really save this series from being the exact oppisite the creators were trying to achieve. You will read about this in a lot of reviews but it's still a complaint from my side: The villian is a complete alien. You get that type of my kids should stay away from that guy whenever possible vibe but he does not live up to his full potetntial. His goals are never stated which means everytime the show cuts him you have to squeeze interest out of yourself to listen to something that may or may not have something to to do with the plot. If you hear what everybody calls him in the series you will realize exactly how uninteresting and stale this weirdo is. The romantic plot that that makes up alot of the show's \"story\" goes nowhere. I was really expecting something , anything. I have to listen to whining and arguing between two people I dont give a damn for for 13 episodes. Give me something,anything!\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is run-of-the-mill voice acting with the exception of the most intersting characters Gotou and Isshhin. My cousin told me he realized that a lot of voice actors speak with a mono tones when they have to dub anime to english. This is the exact case with Yakumo. When he is supposedly shocked or sad yo just hear that mono tone (a lot like Edward's tone of voice from Twilight). The OP  is terrible. If you can classify under what type of music this falls under please let me know (I only listened to it for about 10 seconds).The ending theme was actually beautiful,it is that type of song you can understand without speaking the language it is performed in.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was alright. It's not like Dragonball where everyone is drawn according to Asian sterotyping,you know that saying . These characters have looks that fit what liitle personality they have perfectly. The backgrounds are okay and the ghost are just \"meh\".\\n\\n\r\nThe show was alright at the beginning but went to make my weekend feel a lot longer and declined after just 2 episodes. I have to admit I liked the ending, I'm a sucker for stuff like that and because the experience was over. Here's what I thought about the show:\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n-Gotou and Isshhin\\n\r\n-Ending theme  \\n\r\n-Ending\\n\r\n-Art was alright\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Everything else\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5/10\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\\n",

This made it very easy to picture myself in the situations.\r\nThe only thing I missed in the story was a huge plot twist, because, even though there were some unexpected events, I wasn't put completely off track all at once. However, I did very much enjoy trying to solve the puzzles they're solving in this detective anime.\r\nAnother thing I liked, was the art: it showed a lot of detail.\r\nOne of the details, by example, is the pupils of Yakumo. If you closely you can seea round pupil in his green eye, but the one is his red eye is more cat like, making it more inhuman.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is probably the best thing in the whole anime: there was character development! Oh, do I love character development...\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the combination of mystery with some supernatural, good art and character development made this a good anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt is the kind of anime you can watch in a very short amount of time, really enjoy, but don't have to become all obsessed over, which is a nice thing, if you have too much too fangirl/fanboy about already in your life like me.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, just go watch it.",

But gladly it's not that boring that you want quit watching it. I was looking for a good detective anime and saw this one being suggested at the MAL featured article. But actually this anime is primarily about human spirits, which are said in this anime to be the remaining emotions left after a human dies. The cases arepretty simple, nothing complicated about it. The story is not that attractive.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nThe background is always dark, my favorite. Most of the incidents happen at night time.

Some awful choice of music made me at awe quite a few times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7/10\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nThe characters are average. We see the characters doing the same thing almost every time.

It is about Yakumo Saitou, an enigmatic student born with a mysterious red eye that allows him to see and communicate with the dead. The story is full of suspense and never boring. The art is just fantastic and the anime has the best anime-soundtrack I've ever heard! The characters are great and make the anime even more enjoying. The only thing i don't like about this anime as a boy is that it's also shojou... I never noticed it until the day i read it here. And that makesme sad because Shinreitantei Yakumo is nothing boys can't watch or read! I wonder why it's shojou because i read the light novel and the novel is not shojou... Nevertheless i can say that the Anime and the Manga can be watched and loved by boys and girls as well!",

            "content": "If you plan on watching Shinrei Tantei Yakumo (Psychic Detective Yakumo) because it has the word 'Detective' in it, I recommend that you don't. Although the name does spell out Detective, the anime does not really fall under the mystery genre. Same goes if you're an action fan - this contains no fight scenes. \r\nWhile starting Psychic Detective Yakumo, I didn't really expect a lot out of it and the first couple of episodes did not help the cause.\r\nBut gradually, this show did better exponentially. This is a story about Saitou Yakumo - a teenager capable of seeing spirits of the dead with his blood- red left eye, and Ozawa Haruka - a girl who initially approaches Yakumo for help, after the death of her friends under mysterious circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nAlthough the plot doesn't contain a lot of suspense, it does contain its fair share of surprises. Since every episode contributes to the main story line, there is no one episode that is completely irrelevant. Honestly speaking, the ending was slightly clich\u00e9, but not disappointing. As this a no-action type of anime, it was kinda expected. \\n\r\nBut in the end, the story is one of the attractions of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThere is nothing about the art that is exceptional and nothing that stands out. It is just your every day anime type of art. (Yakumo closes resembles a mix between Light Yagami from Death Note and Lelouch Lamperouge from Code Geass).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nAs with the art, there is nothing phenomenal about the sound. At times, the sound even feels annoying and misplaced.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nUnlike the art and sound, the characters involved were pretty interesting. And what's more interesting is how the characters in the anime develop. The way the protagonist's true personality is revealed is indeed mesmerising. Some characters (supporting ) though, were left unexplained\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nWhichever way I look at it, I did find the anime enjoyable. There was seldom a dull moment.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nAll in all, I did like Shinrei Tantei Yakumo (Psychic Detective Yakumo) and recommend that you give it a shot and see for yourselves.",

Very suspenseful, with well-though out 'cases.'\r\nHowever, towards the end the anime tries to unify all of the cases under a single plotline, which ends weakly and unresolved. The romance aspect of the anime seems to be completely jammed within the last 4-5 episodes, and detracts from the rest of the experience.\r\nOverall: Worth a watch if you're bored and have nothing else to do.",
