            "content": "Raising a child isn't easy, and every parent or guardian knows just how taxing all of the daily tasks can be, the sacrifices that need to be made in terms of work and social life, and the almost constant stream of considerations and worries. The truth is that looking after children is one of the biggest causes of stress and grey hairs (or hair loss), amongst adults, but given that the majority of people in the world are (or will be), parents, it's a little odd that such a major topic is still a rarity in anime.\r\nThe again, who wants to watch a show aboutthe trials and tribulations of raising children, especially when the steady diet of fanservice, explosions, brainless muscular heroes, top heavy heroines, nonsensical plots, pseudo-psychology, quantum-hokum, etc, are apparently what passes for entertainment these days. It's a sad fact that in a medium where literally any story can be told, the ones that may actually cast anime in a positive light are constantly overlooked or ignored completely.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is why Usagi Drop is such a rarity.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted from the josei manga by Unita Yumi, the story begins with Kawachi Daikichi, a 30 year old salesman who has returned home to attend a family funeral. During his stay he finds out that his deceased grandfather had an illegitimate daughter called Kaga Rin. Nobody knows who the girl's mother is, so the family begin arguing over who will raise her until Daikichi, who has become increasingly annoyed and disgusted by their behaviour, asks Rin if she wants to live with him.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop is one of those uncommon adaptations where the anime has tried to stay true to the source material, and while that does place a number of limitations on it, the series also manages to retain the charm of the manga. The story develops at a measured pace that can sometimes feel a little slow, and there's a surprising lack of over the top melodrama that is so often a hallmark of shows like this. The plot takes a much more mature approach to the issue of parenting than one might initially expect, and while certain problems that Daikichi is faced with are specific to Japanese society, the overall theme is one that will resonate with anyone who has raised children.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is also the reason why some viewers may not enjoy this anime, but we'll get to that in a bit.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the story, the artwork also tries to stay as true as possible to the source material. The characters are depicted in a stylized form, and the rather simplistic approach to emotions is surprisingly expressive. The design is focused on showing each person as an individual not only facially, but also in their build, posture, and even their movements. The animation is fluid, if a little utilitarian at times, and it's clear that attention has been paid to each character's physical traits and personalities. In addition to this each episode is preceded and concluded by short, but rather charming scenes that are notable for the watercolour style palette that is used in them. The dichotomy between these scenes and the style and colouration used in the main body of the narrative adds a nice, almost picture book touch to proceedings.\\n\\n\r\nBetween these shorts and the story proper lie the opening and ending sequences, both of which are designed with children's paintings in mind. The opening theme, \"Sweet Drop\" by Puffy AmiYumi (yes, they of Teen Titans and Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi fame), is a surprisingly well suited J-pop song that's very much in keeping with Rin's character. In contrast to this the ending theme, \"High High High\" by Kasarinchu (a pop duo consisting of a beatboxer and a guitarist/singer), is more reflective of the overall atmosphere of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the background music, Usagi Drop features a variety of tracks that are generally quite mellow or upbeat, but every so often the score is punctuated by a slow, simple piano piece to highlight the more sensitive moments of the story.\\n\\n\r\nNow it's a trite thing to say that good acting can bring any type of story to life and give it the feeling of something new and different, but in this case it's actually a true statement. The simple yet natural script allows the seiyuu far more room to express themselves than one might expect, and with little in the way of manufactured melodrama, all of the cast (especially the child actors), are able to deliver some truly worthwhile performances.\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting character in Usagi Drop is, without a doubt, Kawachi Daikichi. Part of the reason for this is because much of the story is told from his perspective, but he's also one of the most defined adult male leads in anime to date. From the start he is shown to be a complete individual with his own thoughts, habits and values, and rather than trying to develop him, the narrative is more focused on evolving him through his relationship with Rin, and the problems, worries and sacrifices he works through in order to be a good parent.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand Rin is very much how one would expect a child of her age to be - inquisitive, precocious, and somewhat withdrawn around people she doesn't know well. As with Daikichi, she doesn't really develop as a character, but instead what the viewer is shown is a little girl who is slowly coming to terms with her new life and coming out of her shell. Now this is surprising as it's a clear message about how resilient children actually are and how they are able to cope as long as they know they have the support of the adults who care for them.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of support, aside from the two leads there are a surprising number of well written characters in Usagi Drop, both adults and children, and it's their presence in the story that really rounds out the whole thing. The particularly strong friendship between Nitani Kouki and Rin for example, or the slightly befuddled attraction between Daikichi and Kouki's mother Yukari, all add to the overall charm of the series. In addition to this, one of the things that really stands out about Usagi Drop is the lack of angst where relationships are concerned. While there are events like the death of Daikichi's grandfather, these don't cast a pall over the narrative, and this allows for some interesting interactions and dynamics to emerge, the prime example of this being the bond that develops between the two lead characters.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop is a simple, straightforward and charming tale about what it means to be a parent, and while the story and characters are presented in an ideal form, this doesn't really detract from one's enjoyment of the show. It goes without saying that anyone who has experience of raising children will be able to relate more readily to a number of the themes in the show, but it should be pointed out that the plot is simple enough to allow anyone to enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us back to why some people won't like this series.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the sometimes slow pace, the main theme of the show is one that many younger fans (and even a few older ones), may not like, especially if their penchant is for action, heavy melodrama, etc. On the surface it can seem as though Usagi Drop is nothing more than another lighthearted slice of life drama that's only different from the likes of Aishiteruze Baby because a full fledged adult is cast in the role of parent instead of a teenaged playboy, but there's more to the show than that.\\n\\n\r\nThe simple fact is that this anime is one of those rare titles that doesn't use the word \"mature\" as a marker for violence, gore, sexual content, etc, and this makes it almost unique when one considers the shows that have been released this past year. The emphasis on realism, albeit in an idealized form, may also be a factor as there are a few people out there who want pure fantasy and escapism.\\n\\n\r\nWhatever your opinion or taste, one thing remains true - Usagi Drop is clearly aimed at a more mature audience than the norm. The fact that it doesn't demean the creators with pointless gore, violence or fanservice, or insult the viewer's intelligence by explaining everything that happens, are what sets it apart from many other slice of life shows out there.",

            "content": "\u201cDaikichi\u2026 Daikichi, wake up.\u201d \r\n\u201c\u2026mmhhh\u2026 Yes.\u201d\r\nI\u2019m happy. Why? Well, because this show did so much right that it\u2019s tough not to be. Usagi Drop stayed true to the essence of the manga (before the timeskip) and didn\u2019t stray far, if at all, from the original story progression. It captured splendidly the little nuances of an abnormal parent-child reality.\r\nOur lives are full of insignificancies. Waking up irritable and half alert, washing your teeth, brushing your face, fumbling to find your valuables, grocery shopping without a list. The shit we wade through daily but clean up and forget soon after. These are experiences almost all can relateto but never share with one another because it\u2019s stuff not worth sharing. Then of course, spliced in between those bits of irrelevance are the undoubtedly meaningful moments to be remembered. And we want to save those precious moments by documenting them. It\u2019s in our nature to try and preserve the best times of our lives in some form or another. So when something like Usagi Drop comes along that personifies \u2018life\u2019, in both the boring and the beautiful, we\u2019re able to really connect with the characters and their story on a more personal level. \\n\\n\r\nRin is modest, caring, independent, and responsible. She\u2019s very mature but then not without those traits which you find ever-present in kids around her age. Joyful, curious, and downright adorable! In terms of lovability, she\u2019s on par with Ushio in my book. You just want to squeeze those little cheeks and embrace her till she dies of asphyxiation. She\u2019s that HNNNGGable. Needless to say, her expressions are genuine signs of love and appreciation, even for something like a poor attempt at tying pigtails. How she feels shows on her face clear as a sunny day. And the window through which we get to see all these sides of her is Daikichi.\\n\\n\r\nDaikichi\u2019s a very straightforward guy, both in personality and appearance. On top of that, he\u2019s nurturing, compassionate, and protective. A little awkward at times but it comes with the job. Not to say I don\u2019t like my dad, I love him, but Daikichi is the kind of father I wished I\u2019d had growing up. He juggles his new responsibilities well with work and still manages to maintain a good relationship with everyone around him. Standing in as a guardian for your past grandfather\u2019s illegitimate kid probably isn\u2019t easy so I think he deserves a break here and there for his goofups. Watching Daikichi is a true breath of fresh air what with all the high school/university kids hogging most of the attention in anime. What you get is a middle aged guy just trying to do his best to provide for himself and his new little house warmer.\\n\\n\r\nTWO little house warmers considering the frequency of Kouki\u2019s visits. He and his mother are two more people you\u2019ll find to be endearing as they interact with Rin and Daikichi. Aside from his apparent cheekiness, Kouki\u2019s a good kid and it shows in his submissive yet protective behavior towards Rin. Looking at their close friendship and the overt chemistry between Yukari and Kawachi, it\u2019s quite easy to envision them becoming a family in the near future. In fact, beyond the show\u2019s conclusion you could say they\u2019re already family.\\n\\n\r\nAnd because of the relatively fluid art and animation, we\u2019re able to see how they become so close. Soft watercolour-esque scenes start out each episode before the opening song rolls. It\u2019s really a nice way of preceding the bulk of the episode. Character designs are markedly simplistic but there\u2019s no need to fuss over it. With some added touches of realism, it\u2019s nice knowing they do change clothes each day and night and that Daikichi does grow a stubble if he doesn\u2019t shave every day like any other grown man. The backgrounds are subtle yet detailed; from pavement cracks to packaged market meat, everything in view is easy on the oculars.\\n\\n\r\nTo supplement the animation is the writing which shines through in the dialogue. Ayu and Tsuchida\u2019s performance as the voices of Rin and Daikichi leave little more to be asked for. Thanks to them and all the other seiyuus, the talking that goes on in the show becomes one of its strengths. For example, in one episode, Daikichi and Harumi, Reina\u2019s mom, have a serious discussion about Harumi\u2019s marital problems which is eavesdropped on by Rin. But noticing this, Reina takes her aside and shows her how she copes when mom and dad don\u2019t get along. Not something seen every day, you get both the child and parent\u2019s perspectives of when things aren\u2019t going so smoothly at home. Really, kids are keen in times like that and it\u2019s great to see that the anime picks up on this detail. And it\u2019s not only those I\u2019ve listed who have depth of character but everyone has their own charm about them and grows, if just a little, in their own way in the span of only a year.\\n\\n\r\nNow soundwise, the piano melodies and environmental acoustics fit well with whatever present surroundings were onscreen. The opening/ending songs are two very cheery jingles. Catchy it was but not enough to my taste to warrant a replay every week. Though, I would\u2019ve never known that the group who did the opening is the same group who did the Teen Titans theme song (one of my favorites) had I not looked it up. Nostalgia, woo! From their tower they can see that all together, the music worked in pacing the way scenes played out.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop was an engagingly heartfelt tale of an atypical family living and learning how to adjust to their odd circumstances and the intricacies it affords. It handled themes like the importance of family values and the trials of child raising with great consideration for its audiences. \\n\\n\r\nDespite its title I advise against dropping this anime because sitting down to watch Rin and Daikichi go through child/parenthood is an experience to be cherished. And I, for one, certainly have.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Secretly funded by the Japanese government to combat declining birth rates, project \"USAGI DROP\" targeted a very specific, generally non-reproductive demographic of the Japanese population: the otaku. At the core of the project was a 11 episode television series that was specifically designed to thoroughly rouse hibernating paternal instincts. Researchers noted a 41% increase in the desire to have children in males in their 20s to 30s who watched a single episode of Usagi Drop. Researchers also noted that of that 41%, 77% of those males explicitly stated that they wanted daughters. One of the biggest advantages project USAGI DROP had over its predecessor, projectMINDLESS ECCHI is that it instilled the desire to propagate in its viewers rather than the desire to merely fornicate. Researchers of the project also documented what later became termed as the \"Usagi Drop effect;\" after watching an episode of Usagi Drop, viewers would often ramble off a list of random names before being able to engage in proper conversation. After a conducting several widespread interviews, researchers discovered that these ramblings were the external symptoms of an internal debate that was common among all viewers of Usagi Drop; the viewers consistently tried to decide what name they wanted to bestow on their offspring after watching an episode of Usagi Drop. After these very promising test results, the Japanese Government gave the project the green light and the anime aired in the Summer of 2011. They are expecting great returns in nine months.",

            "content": "I have watched every single slice-of-life anime since 2005 and Usagi Drop still manages to easily stand out. A good amount of slice of life shows focus on pumping high school girls full of moe and or filling their daily lives with excessive drama and irrationally difficult people. Usagi Drop, however, portrays itself in stark contrast; unforced, un-contrived, and totally natural, the show manages to make its characters and events truly heartwarming without having to resort to overcoming some out-of-place difficulty or killing off characters.\r\nNow more than half-way into the season at episode 6, all the characters have managed to display a definite depth ofpersonality and emotion that most other shows never achieve. Daikichi, his mom, his sister, Rin, Haruko, and even the controversial Masako all refuse to be classified down into silly anime stereotypes. Though they each have their own problems in life, they all manage to radiate a heartwarming and real aura. In their actions and words the mature audience can easily spot a heartfelt kindness and the tender je ne sais quoi of life. The characters are, in fact, more than just characters in some story.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd although Usagi Drop still holds an intrinsically touching storyline, it delivers it in pleasant harmony with its characters, its art, and its background music. The audience is transported into the somewhat daunting life of a single Japanese salary-man and sudden father. Yet despite this bleakness, we see the world of Daikichi and Rin as a place filled warmth and a firm sense of family. The chorus of music in the background, neither harkening doom nor hollering gloom, is instead a duet of simplicity, playfulness, and nostalgia. The environmental BGM seeks to neither to overshadow nor contradict the characters, but instead augment gentle Daikichi's kindness, precocious Rin's sweetness, energetic Gotou's friendliness, etc. \\n\\n\r\nNext, the opening theme, Sweet Drops by Puffy, is a touch of crayon magic mixed with a well-performed song that perfectly captures the pure and innocent love so subtly themed throughout the show. This show is quickly leaving the realm of simple afternoon entertainment and entering the realm of heartwarming artwork.",

            "content": "To be Frank, I was skeptical about committing to watching Usagi Drop having read all the manga. Adaptations are great and all, but boy oh boy the direction source material (manga) took didn't sit well with me, leaving me doubtful about this as a whole.\r\nNow, I can safely say I'm glad to have watched this amazing experience. \r\nSo how do I describe and score Usagi Drop? Well, this happens to be one of those shows where numbers just won't do, and an in-depth analysis is quite frankly overkill. I can talk all I want about what it's about; the premise, the execution, the pacing; noneof this will do it justice. But heck, I'll give it a shot just for you. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\\n\r\nWe follow our Main \"protagonist\" Karachi Daikichi, a single 30 year old man whose grandfather has recently passed away. At his grandfather's funeral, he meets his grandfather's  daughter, Kaga Rin; age 6. \\n\\n\r\nHmm.... Ok... So this little girl is his....\\n\\n\r\nMoving along, Both the two meet and under the rather dreary atmosphere of mourning adults, Daikichi takes Rin under his wing and thus begins Daikichi's new life as a parent. \\n\\n\r\nPretty basic premise... Meh, not really. Transition into parenting/parenthood is a topic RARELY touched on in anime. Why? Doesn't sell... Anyways, the story focuses heavily on Daikichi's and Rin's new life, how they adapt, perceive, and going about the day. Now, remember, Daikichi has been a single 30 year old working and drinking constantly, having only to care and feed for one person. Let's add another expense to deduct from your income... Don't forget, kids have soccer (football) games and stuff. Better to make some time in my already dreadfully unflexible schedule..\\n\\n\r\nGet the picture? Good, but ultimately, the story only moves forward with each new experience both Rin and Daikichi undergo. With that, we see that as time goes on,  they change and develop.\\n\r\nAs far as pacing goes, it's relatively slow paced... Then again, with an awkward number of 11 episodes, this seems appropriate. Each episode never seems rushed.. Scratch that, each scene never seems rushed. The story isn't overly complex, so holes aren't an issue. All in all, the only word to describe the story is simple, and that isn't such a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nFans could give this a 10, those without a heart could name it plotless. Depending on what you're expecting, it could go either way.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis was a surprise considering Production I.G touched this one up. If we look at Production IG's other works, we see something completely different from what you see here. Please be aware, this is a pleasant surprise. Thumbs up on this one.\\n\\n\r\nThe show comes off as.. Rather childish, but it isn't that big of a deal considering that kids are involved in the story after all. In fact, the art is rather fitting, and in those few moments throughout the show, I stared in awe at the magnificently drawn and animated scenes. This might be a surprise because the art is so simplistic. Character design, lighting,  the background. Nothing held extraordinary detail except, again, in those few moments of high interest and excitement, although \"excitement\" isn't so appropriate to describe this.\\n\\n\r\nI must compliment the pastel, water color-y (forgive me as I am uneducated in accurate art terminology) scenes through out the series. It's very different than what many people are probably used to seeing on the current market.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, because of how boldly the art is presented, the different art style showing off as strongly as it does might end up being a miss for many.\\n\\n\r\nSo how do I sum up the art? Like the story. Simple, but sweet, with a touch of magnificent sprinkled in. It isn't Shinkai breathtaking, but it's pretty dang close in many scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 \\n\\n\r\nCharacter voices are appropriate for the whole cast. I might have a problem with only one character, but she's completely overlook able in comparison to everyone else. The sound track was well done, though Unmemorable. Heck, everything was done satisfactorily here as the pleasant background music compliments the \"feel good\" atmosphere. The music even addresses the more dramatic scenes with ease. The OP and ED are nothing too special, but very fitting to the theme of Bunny Drop.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nNow, this may seem like a slice of life show, and it is, but the abnormal time frame this series has is rather stressing to many viewers for many reasons. For example, many short series fail to develop their characters since, like in life, time is limited, so rushed plots and such can hurt the cast as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Usagi Drop nails that instinctive preconception to the ground. With only two main characters and very well planned out execution and pacing, there is a feeling of satisfaction by watching Rin and Daikichi grow. Heck, we even see there is more to the support roles than what we are presented prior to the next time they make an appearance. The show addresses how Daikichi feels and grows quite clearly, which then leads the viewer to imply a few thing about Rin. While Rin arguably is very static, we must realize that she is a 6 year old. A child whose mind is still in development. Realistic? Appropriate? Do you have a problem with this ideally perfect little girl? Stuff your whining and refresh your perspectives.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the show, I came to realize what a delight It was to watch Daikichi & Rin grow as characters as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nA rare delight and one of the best shows of 2011. It's hard to explain why this anime was so successful. The story is a heartwarming one, packed with many little lessons on ethics and such. Perhaps our reaction to the characters and their interactions came off as hilarious. Going into the show, you might find plenty of the characters relatable even. Perhaps this caused me to reflect on my childhood and outlook for my future. Usagi Drop offers something for everyone to relate to and enjoy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\\n\r\nHopefully this gave you enough insight as to whether or no you should pick up Usagi drop. Be aware, the intended audience is a more older one, not really specifically targeting teens or younger audiences of the sort. Still, the show is appropriate for a broad audience. If you're looking for action, harem, a complex plot, you'll find none of that here. What exists before you is a really simple but sweet treasure that can be watched without being disappointed. I encourage you to give this show a shot at becoming what could be one of your favorites of all time. My only issue with this show is that it was given a measly and awkward 11 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts? It was far from perfect, but Usagi Drop did so many things right that it doesn't even matter.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this was helpful. \\n\\n",

            "content": "To: Anime Fans   \r\n   Since there is only one episode of this out and I can't speak for the whole thing, of course, but I do want people to know that this one, so far, is definitely worth watching and why I think in the future it will be well worth your time.\r\nFIRST RESPONSE (Literally minutes after finishing my first watch through of the first episode. I actually posted it as a comment then copied and pasted it here because I thought it fit well.)\r\n  Wow, simply beautiful and intriguing, this episode alone could stand on it's own. I knowthere's going to be more and that awesome but in retrospect it may not, hopefully will though, live up to what this has episode portrayed and what I expect to be the standard for the rest of this anime's duration. Overall it's a great set up to what could have a wonderful, touching, deep, story with vivid and evolving characters to bout. But that's to be seen; for now, my hopes are high.\\n\\n\r\n   Now for the review portion of this review.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: I don't want to say much into this regard as there has been only ONE episode but I can say confidently that it will be good...if not played out, but good never the less. I say this only because I have seen these types of anime before and if the birth mother is ever out of the picture to start then, naturally, she will re-enter the frame. But as a famous quote states, it's not the path you take but it's how you walk it. Ok that's not famous (I actually just made it up) but you get the picture. I read some complaints about how you don't know enough of the story and how people are feeling lost. My only response to that is...IT'S THE FIRST EPISODE! Give it time. If they revealed all at the start why would you watch it? Suspense is key to good ratings and they know this. I think they did a great job, but I'll talk about that later.  Moving right along,\\n\\n\r\nART: Now I'm no art major nor do I claim or want, no offense, to be one. As a person who can only draw stick figures, anything that has any sembalnce of resembalnce to reality is good (that's a tongue twister), does that make this anime good? Yes, to me at lest. I have seen plenty of anime and have come across ones that even I don't care for but the art style here really seems to flow with the feel of this show. It's calm and smooth. It's dull and faded. It's bright and happy. It's perfect, in my none expert's opinion. The art will add a level of feeling to the show that mere story or characters could bring (not saying those aren't equally as important). And so we're off to the next one,\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: ...? Um...Hmu.....I...no that's n...it's...I...well its sound. I have never really understood this one. The again I watch streaming anime so the sound quality is not on par all the time. But, I expect it's more for the action animes, the one with a lot going on and what not, but for this anime I am at a lose for words (I know! Me! Well actually you don't do you? O well) Lets just say the voice acting is stellar, as usual (SUBS NOT DUBS), anyway, the music all fits well, nothing played that seemed out of place or that distracted me in anyway from the anime and the goings ons. Moving ons,\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Oh My God! (I know who types that out anymore?) That's just how excited I am to see how these characters will progress! The first episode did an amazing job at setting up each important character. Not letting on to much into anyone's past but giving enough background information so that you can feel a certain level of understanding towards most of them. Lets go down the list: \\n\r\n  Rin. Quiet and reserved, never went out of here way to defend or react to anything that happened, with one exception. She only had about 4 or 5 lines but actions speak louder then words (who said that? Hold up one second...to Google! Well I heard that Mark Twain said it, also that some old German writer coined it, also that a 5 year old said it as his first words. That was a pointless expedition, lets return to the review, shall we). The one exception that I mentioned earlier...um spoiler I guess...is when Daikichi asks if she wants to live with him and she runs to his side. Can't wait to see what changes she bring to Daikichi and herself. \\n\r\n  Daikichi. I was having troubles trying to pinpoint his specific character. At first I thought he was a loner and not socially aware, someone who throws them self into there work, that's how I justified a social loner getting a phone call in the beginning. But he acts and reacts to well in a social setting. So I moved to, not a social loner, but a self proclaimed loner, no matter what, I can tell he is a loner in some form or another. He was always segregated just a little bit from the group, even though they are his family, like sitting away from the table, actually noticing and paying attention to Rin, simple things that are both in his personality and his manner of speech. Cant wait to see how he changes, as fore-mentioned in the paragraph above. \\n\r\n  Haruko. I don't know why but I feel like she will become an important character later in the show (god I hope I'm not wrong here). I cant say much about her character as she had little lines and even less air time but her presence made an impact on me, though that was probably because her child was quiet prominent. I'm going to go out on a limb and say she will, most likely, be Daikichi's love interest; however, if they are related disregard all of this. I say this because there was no indication that she was related to Daikichi. I know she has a child but there was not the slightest inkling of mention to a husband. Though it troubles me why she was, at all, at the funeral. Also, Daikichi was caught starring at her. This is what probably peaked my interests. For know just note I said this and disregard it if I'm wrong.\\n\r\nIn summary (of the character portion) Rin is quiet, Daikichi a loner, and Haruko possibly a insectual love interest, all show great promise and I cant stress enough how much I can't wait to see their growth. \\n\\n\r\nI have high hopes, very high hopes. Don't let me down Usagi Drop.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Rin has the most adult face I have ever seen on an anime child. There normally so bubbly and cute but hers is stern, beautiful and elegant and reminds me of some other female (adult) character I've seen somewhere...can't quiet place it though. Also, disregard the ratings I just thought I had to rate it and it wont let me change it back to nothing so I set them to all 10's in expectation of my high hopes being fulfilled. \\n\\n\r\nFrom: Steve",

            "content": "God. I suppose this was best time in my life for me to watch this series. I just went through a lot of stress with family and this really helped me understand some of the things that go on when you're a parent, even a single parent. I'm not gonna say the cliche stuff like \"It's never easy being a parent.\" and I can't say anything from experience, as I am not a father or legal guardian. But I was raised by a single mother without a father in my life until 7 years ago.\r\nThis review is going to differ from my other reviews inthe fact that I can't really find anything that was wrong with the series. It was cute and it was heart warming. There was no action, that wasn't what the writer was going for, and that might push a few people away because a lot of people watch anime for an unrealistic story that goes away from what happens in reality. This series provides that realism that is missing in so many other series that I have seen. It is really nice to see a realistic series once in a while. The animation really fit the feel of the series.\\n\\n\r\nBut onto the other aspect that I loved. The characters. Mostly Rin. I loved Rin because i could relate to her. And she has made it up in the list of my favorite fiction characters for that reason. I also loved the Daikichi on the main fact that he took this 6 year old girl, whom he had never met before, into his home and raised her as a daughter. There are other characters I liked. Nitani reminding me of my own mother and Kouski reminding me of a few childhood friends.\\n\\n\r\nThis series really it hit it in the heart for me. It didn't cry, but I related to a lot of the things that happened in the series.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\r\nIf you want to watch a heart warming series. Watch this one. It doesn't have action, it's not overplayed. And all the characters feel more or less original and human.\\n\\n\r\n9/10",

            "content": "The 'Slice of Life' genre is presented best as two sides of the same coin: one side depicts naturalism - showing a parallel to the reality of an average person, whether that\u2019d be hardships through life lessons, growing up and facing the real world, or experiencing something for the first time that leaves you in awe, while the other displays mundane experiences lacking conflict and development for the story and characters, solely presented to 'tug the heartstrings' of a person. It's a challenging idea to demonstrate for a wide variety of audiences who have their own preferences of what 'Slice of Life' is, simply bythe fact that everyone is unique, and will experience different aspects of what life has to offer as they grow up. Usagi Drop, however, manages to do everything right that all Slice of Life anime should strive for; Showcasing realism told through a strong narrative. \\n\\n\r\nTired of unrealistic, teenage, school dramas that have predictable outcomes, lack of character development, cheesy romantic sequences, and excessive melodramatic encounters? Tired of fan service characters and scenes that have no purpose in being in an anime, or sequences that were solely made to make us feel bad on-purpose? I know I sure was. With the exception of shows like Mushishi, I never once really felt like Slice of Life was natural or displayed a true realistic outtake on life; always having a forced outcome on situation that could be easily solved without immoderate drama, shoving moe down our throats, or painting a greater, grander picture of something that's meant to be a far fetched philosophical outtake on life. Usagi Drop is nothing like this, hell, it\u2019s probably one of the most unique, heartwarming, and ambitious anime I\u2019ve watched this year.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop is about what it means to be a family, and how raising a child has its merits and challenges. We are presented with something that has a mature feeling about each situation Kawachi Daikichi, the main character, encounters when put to the task of raising Rin Kawa, his grandfather\u2019s illegitimate daughter, taxing his already stressful life of being a single, working man. Usagi Drop doesn\u2019t try to woe you with pretty aesthetics or complicated characters to analyze, it\u2019s trying to showcase an event in our lives that will happen to most people: parenthood; as well as time management, dealing with no duel income, stress when things don\u2019t go your way, and normal things that eventually pile up and happen to us.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop isn\u2019t just solely based on a parent\u2019s perspective of life though, we also get to witness what the children in the anime are feeling as well, with Rin specifically, on how losing a loved one and moving in with a stranger you just met from the same family has an effect on you psychologically. Presenting two perspectives on the same situation of starting a family is a sign of a strong narrative, as it can relate to two different types of people watching the anime to get a better idea on the greater thematic value the show displays through realistic scenarios each of these characters go through. Maturity in the story-telling is what made the immersion and enjoyment so much more enjoyable than your typical run-of-the-mill anime. Not once was disbelief suspended, nor did I have to go back to understand something that didn't make sense the first time around due to flawed logic. \\n\\n\r\nCharm in not only the story, but characters, is a frequent occurrence that makes Usagi Drop differentiate from majority of Slice of Life anime. Daikichi is the perfect example of how to write a realistic character, and in fact, a dad. With popular dad characters like Shou Tucker, Gendou Ikari, and Gamino, perspectives on what a fatherly figure is positively shown is a rare occurrence. Daikichi is a loving, compassionate, and hardworking fatherly figure that supports Rin\u2019s transition into his life and will go to any lengths he can to make sure she\u2019s comfortable and gets the proper necessities, while also spoiling her. Awkward and laid-back, but brimming with motivation and determination. Rin is a believable child character. With a side of independence and maturity, she also has a childish side to her who eventually learns to open up more and love her family that once shunned her. Masako, Rin\u2019s biological mother, takes the role as the typical \u2018I don\u2019t want anything to do with my child\u2019 role, but has a unique personality and traits of a stressful, mangaka workaholic who never could possibly have time to support Rin. The supporting characters, the Nitani family, are very similar to Daikichi and Rin with a single parent raising one child. Both the mother and Daikichi, as well as Kouki and Rin, become friends that help each other when dealing with later occurrences, while also learning from each other.\\n\\n\r\nScenes incorporating the right use of music to enhance the overall mood, as well as visuals to enrich the beauty of the anime were all very solid and consistent, never breaking off or diminishing in quality. While the anime is beautiful on its own, and setting up the mood helps make scenes and story telling more influential through visuals and sound, it's important to not pay too much attention to these sort of details in Usagi Drop's case, as what really shines is how the narrative and characters connect to make a grand experience of witnessing life.\\n\\n\r\nWhat kind of an effect did Usagi Drop leave on me? It made me realize the importance of family and how important it is to stay in touch with them. Falling outs with family members is tragic and unfortunate, or with loved one dying. It\u2019s a situation where you as an individual need others to help coupe with such feelings that friends may not be able to understand clearly as much as family members do. It made me realize how life is moving fast, and at any minute something can happen which can result in your entire perspective on life changed in an instant. Treasuring moments now instead of waiting for what\u2019s in store for the future will help you better understand what it means to live and start a family.  Now, I\u2019m not a father/parent, nor was I adopted. So I\u2019m sure that people who actually are can relate to Usagi Drop on another level. Even so, that didn\u2019t hinder my outcome on what the core message Usagi Drop was trying to showcase. Anyone can see the value and beauty in such a heartwarming, telling narrative, recommended for anyone who wants a realistic approach on what your future might be like when raising a child. \\n",

            "content": "Story:\r\nThere really isn't that much to say about Usagi Drop.It's a feel-good story about a man rediscovering/ or discovering for the first time on the true joys of life through the child rearing of his adoptive daughter, Rin. There isn't anything groundbreaking or particularly unique with the plot but it will definitely pull on your heartstrings and you'll come out out of the series with a simile on your face\r\n7/10\r\nArt:\r\nThe art-style of Usagi Drop is something that follows the original art-style from the manga faithfully and to put it bluntly its unique. Its a style of art different to the trends of modern anime butit has an innocent and whimsical joy that seems to capture the essence of the show . Though beware if you are something who judges an anime but this aspect can be hit or miss. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe Voice-Acting in this is spot-on for Rin, the voice-actor in the Japanese Dub did a fantastic job in capturing the lovable innocence whilst also not giving her that annoying vocal pitch that children tend to have in anime. The other voice-actors were decent, nothing really stood out and they did their jobs. The OP and the ED are adorable, especially that Opening which captures the innocent joy and love between the two main characters. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThis is where i think the anime shines. On a technical viewpoint, Usagi Drop is not the an artistic wonder but the characters that have been created and terrific. You feel like all of these characters are real, that their personalities and actions can all be attributed to something someone in that demographic would do. Rin, in my opinion is the stand out character, she mixes in that innocent joy without the grating annoyance of anime children. She simply is a joy to watch 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you can't already tell from my review that I love this anime, then well let me state it a secondary time. I love this anime, I had a great time watching it and its one of the few that I could be bothered to a) Marathon and b) Repeat Watch. Usagi Drop is not a technical masterpiece, don't watch it for stunning animation, deep philosophical story line or jaw-dropping sound; you watch this for its fleshed out characters and for those moments of just heart-tweaking joy. 9/10\\n",

            "content": "This is definitely a slice of life anime, yet something is different about it. The style both in the art and story telling is breathtakingly simple. It is the story of a 30 year old man who takes on the task of raising a child. A 6 year old girl no less. The child of his grandfather, his illegitimate child. \r\nUsagi drop presents us with a very simple yet complicated issue which plagues society daily. How does one deal with a child? How would you raise her and what do you teach her? How do you share memories with them that you do not bothhave? Children are smart, they can make a connection if you mention the simplest things, and there is nothing you can hide from them. How do you calm her heart, when she notices that her life is different from her peers? What can you do? This show does not answer these questions, it just makes you wonder more about them. The simple story is sweet and heart felt with every event. One can relate to this child as we've all felt the same way when we were children. Will he really be back to pick me up? will i just be abandoned (in this case, again)? What is death? Just like anyone else in the world but a child's especially, trust must be earned and this is made more complicated in a society where it has become customary to trust no one.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is simple again just like the story and fits the feel of the show perfectly. The section before the opening theme in every episode is done in a way that feels as though the line art was handed to a child to fill in the colors with her marker set, giving that section a very strong reminiscent feeling.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, consisting primarily of piano solos sometimes accompanied by strings, kicks in at the perfect times fading in and out seamlessly. They are not grand scores but are beautiful nonetheless. At key moments the director sometimes chooses to have the music go silent, leaving only the key background noises and the voices of the characters, and he uses this to great effect. It can be said the music is as light as a child's emotions, void of the heavy ideals of a grown up, easily carried away by the breeze of the moment.\\n\\n\r\nOver all this is a very sentimental show, and completely character driven. By it's nature it is very VERY slow paced, however it would not have the same effect otherwise and i would not have it any other way. As long as you do not mind a slow paced show i recommend this to anyone who likes emotional ones.",

            "content": "UD is a parenting manual. It is an anime that deals with the issues of raising a kid and how you must pretty much sacrifice everything for it. There are no boobs or giant robots here; this is so much slice of life it is practically bleeding. \r\nStory: \r\n30-year-old bachelor Daikichi decides to adopt his recently deceased grandfather's love child Rin as a way of flipping the bird to his snotty relatives. Domestic bliss ensues. \r\nThe story started off very powerfully and was very cunningly adept at tugging on heartstrings the way it portrayed a neglected but very sweet child building a trusting family relationshipwith an adult who was clueless about parenting but nevertheless grew to be quite good at it. Then, somehow, each succeeding episode focused more on making a point about how wonderful/terrible parenting is rather than telling a story. Much like real life, the plot shows random stuff happening within the span of a year without much cohesion. While this is not a bad thing per se, the story would have benefited from some sort of conflict and climax. A plot, in short, is missing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nDaikichi is a stoic character taking everything in stride with admirable patience. He is a lovely character to watch as he faces the terrors being a parent: from arranging for daycare to discovering a pool of piss on his bed. His spontaneous act of reckless kindness at the beginning slowly forms into a bond of responsibility with his adopted daughter. His interactions with the other characters make him realise things he had never before thought of. Very solid character development.\\n\r\nRin is the adopted daughter. Simply put, she is a fictional character. The only way a kid her age could be as cute, polite and sweet is to shoot it full of Valium. Leaving this detail aside, she also has excellent character development. Little by little she is shown to come out of her shell and finally come to trust her substitute parent completely. \\n\r\nMasako is Rin\u2019s biological mother who dumped her. Refreshingly, Masako is not portrayed like a filthy demon from hell but as a real individual. She made her choice and we see her dealing with the consequences. Still, I expected her part to be slightly more important.\\n\r\nRin\u2019s classmate Kouki & his single mom are pretty much permanent fixtures in Daikichi and Rin\u2019s life. They are a form of mirror to our protagonists, so similar in their single parent family structure yet so very different in character and dynamics. \\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are also very realistic. Slice of life up to 11. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: \\n\r\nExcellent animation. Realistic backgrounds, awesome details, very fluid motion. The studio worked their asses off on this one. Also, as a neat bonus, the first minute or so is done in soft watercolour-y style. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nDiscreet. It underlines the emotional parts and fulfils its function simply and cleanly. \\n\r\nOP & ED: truth be told, they annoyed the hell out of me so I skipped them every single time.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\nThis is tricky. While I've enjoyed this show, its realistic characters and its window into Japan's family ties it ultimately failed to move me. The first three or four episodes were dynamite but then it fizzed out. Too much moral lecturing on the virtue of sacrifice, too little structured plot. I am glad I watched this but I don't feel the need to keep this or watch it again. \\n",

            "content": "Usagi Drop is a breath of fresh air for those who are a bit tired with the excessive amounts of fanservice, dull characters, and even duller plots that seem to plague the medium. For once we can have an anime that touches upon issues in a serious and honest manner, while having just about the right amount of lightheartedness and humor that prevents the series from getting too heavy. The result is a heartwarming, feel good tale that manages to allow viewers to empathize with the characters and perhaps the show as a whole to be adorable without feeling that they are being insulted.\r\nVisually, UsagiDrop is pleasing to the eye, and the watercolor style art creates a pretty distinct effect-- it also looks different.  It's not the most breathtaking artwork out there, but it's consistent and you never get a feeling of blockiness that tends to happen with the cheaper animated works. It also gives off kind of a nostalgic feeling that makes me feel like I'm watching a family oriented children's cartoon, but not in a bad way.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals also go really well with the audio, most notably the opening song Sweet Drops. \"Yay, everything is happy and cute\" is the mood I get from it. Overall, it's very upbeat and optimistic\\n\\n\r\nBut while we have this atmosphere of idealism and happiness, the story itself isn't all just a happy world where nothing can go wrong. Indeed, the very premise is about a child by name of Rin who has no one that wants to take her in, and a lot of her family didn't even know she existed. It's a terrible thing for a child to feel unwanted, yet here we have the relatives playing hot potato with a child. On the other hand, taking care of a child isn't exactly something you can just do, and this is what the story will go on about. Answers aren't easy and clear cut.\\n\\n\r\nEnter Dakachi; a man that is still single and has no idea of how to raise a child. Naturally the folks around him aren't exactly confident, but since he's the only one that will step up to the plate.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime takes us along with Dakachi and Rin, as well as their friends and family on a journey of growth.  Dakachi must learn to raise Rin, and Rin must learn to recognize this man that just took her in. Naturally it's not exactly an easy process, and I really enjoyed how gradual the anime made the process. Never has an experience about the typically boring routine of people's lives been so entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop isn't the most exciting of animes, nor is the plot the most complex, but watching the characters gradually develop into people that are more able to handle the difficulties of life makes this an outstanding watch. It truly does justice to the term \"Slice of Life\".\\n\\n\r\nSo if you need something a bit different, but is also light and relaxing, I wholeheartedly recommend this. Perhaps it'll allow you to see anime in a better light, or even be able to share this with other folks without having them look at you funny.\\n",

            "content": "Script - A guy takes care of a girl. Implications? She gets happier than before. Guy becomes more responsible. New connections are established on a superficial level and by the end what you have is a guide on how to raise children that actually doesn't work. Why? Because the child in question isn't a child, but an adult. A smaller version of it at least. She's so mature it is not even fun to see the protagonist parenting, we know it is not necessary. The only reason why the initial relationship between the two takes place is that she's traumatized due her father's death. Thatleads to a very interesting moment when she's afraid of death and all, but it ends there. So in every episode you have a minor struggle and the bigger one is present in all episodes, that would be both trying to act like a natural family. However, that's already solved in previous episodes and I can't see signs of such struggle, making the plot tiring and boring. I don't care about parenting for the sake of parenting. Put something interesting in between such simplistic events otherwise no way it'll end up being poignant at all. The dialogues are rather normal and full of sameness and tropes like the one where the father says he's not going to do something, the child drops the head in disappointment and right after the father says he's going to do something else for the kid's amusement. How cute, I've seen this just a couple of million times. The only credit I can give this show in terms of maturity is the fact it does not create stupid situations that would never happen in real life.\\n\\n\r\nCinematography - Watercolor amuses me at some points, but suddenly everything goes normal again and there's nothing attractive about characters' look. Camera angles are captivating at times, like in the first episode where they're utilized to construct a non-verbal relationship between the protagonist and the little girl. However, I'll not go as far as saying it impressed me overall, just decent enough and that's it.\\n\\n\r\n\"The opening represents the growth process through plants just like in the actual story\" Obvious, Captain.\\n\\n\r\nSound - I love tracks that keep playing all the time in most slice of life because there wasn't that much of effort being put in their production. The opening and ending are cool. Voices are not forced what is cool, but besides the girl's one that actually conveys some emotion in emotional moments, there's nothing special at all.\\n\\n\r\n1234 - zzzzzzzzz going to kindergarten zzzzzzzz going back from kindergarten zzzzzzzzz poop jokes from the boy who's there for some reason zzzzzzzzz *WAKING UP* did it end? Cute show. What happened again?\\n\\n\r\nGuy takes care of a girl very realistically during almost 4 hours. It's not bad, but not my thing either. I like parenting, but I don't like hearing from other people how they raise their children nor seeing it because it gets boring pretty fast. Usagi Drop could've been great if only had explored themes or created bigger struggles for its characters. I heard from someone that the manga contains Incest, now that seems exciting.",

            "content": "Beautiful...a word often used in the realms of the arts, except of course in anime. Anime is often comical, action packed, suspenseful, mysterious, heart-warming...but it is rare when one can truly describe an anime as being beautiful.\r\nUsagi Drop is that anime. A show that, from the very beginning, knows exactly what it is, and is completely unapologetic about it. It's the video game without any combat, the movie without the almost naked woman, the novel where the main character is not the most important. Usagi drop breaks down all boundaries by attempting to break none. Tension, real tension, over tiny bumps in the road, andsubstantive emotional feedback in the most mundane circumstances is what makes Usagi Drop stand tall above all other slice of life anime, and most others for that matter.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\r\nSimplicity is the name of the game. Written out, the plot of Usagi drop would be an advanced kindergarten book, but that doesn't matter. No ridiculous plot twists, just an anime which attempts to shine a light on the inherit beauty of kindness, children, and life. But that is not to say the anime is too slow, rather it is paced perfectly throughout the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nNothing to say here. The art style was different, but it fit well with the theme of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nThe sound track, like the story is simple. The voices and acting is well executed and directed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\r\nI will only address the two main characters here. Daikichi is written excellently, he is nonchalant about most everything, but is easily freaked out by new things that Rin does or new experiences with Rin. Like a real person, he isn't some hell spawn constantly begging for the audience to feel for him, he's just a guy living an almost normal life.\\n\\n\r\nRin is written like a child, and while it's strange to say, her, as a normal child, is incredibly refreshing. She isn't a target for emotional outpouring, she's just a child who behaves like a child. She's the weird combination of shy and outgoing that children tend to be.\\n\\n\r\nLike the story, the characters are written without anything particularly impressive, if you don't count behaving like humans without seeming impossibly cool or outrageously clueless impressive in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nUsagi Drop is just a good watch, and it is very easy to watch....I gave it a 10, so I obviously enjoyed everything...",

            "content": "Slice of life is generally a tricky genre to get right. When I say slice of life, I don't mean those dime-a-dozen high school comedies the industry has become oversaturated with as of late. Rather, I refer to series that find something meaningful to explore through the small conflicts of commonplace events. All too often, attempts at this genre come off as either excessive and unnatural or dull and listless. It stands to reason, then, that the best shows of this kind are the ones that introduce unfamiliar elements that make these characters' lives distinct from our own, while still staying in touch with thelittle aspects of ordinary life that make people who they are. Bunny Drop is one such work, and it executes this beautifully. It's a small, unambitious story about ordinary people but it carries itself with a certain measure of refined dignity that's rarely seen in anime in general, let alone the slice of life genre. It has genuine insight into parenthood, but it never talks down to its audience and you don't have to be a parent to get behind the story. This is quite honestly one of the most accessible anime I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe staff of Production IG handled this show with the sort of nurturing care rarely seen in a slice of life anime, which usually tend to get the short end of the stick production-wise. Backgrounds are surprisingly detailed, colors are warm and rich, and even when the character models go into super-deformed mode (which happens often) movements are fluid and quality control remains excellent. Of particular note are the opening segments of each episode, which are animated in a soft crayon-esque style reminiscent of a children's storybook. That's to say nothing of the charming character designs. Every character is distinctive in an understated way that isn't too far-removed from reality. Family members really do resemble one another (which is especially great since this is a show about family), but not to the point that they could be called carbon copies. The children are cute without defaulting to an overly moe-fied style as Japanese animation is wont to do. This is a spectacular visual effort that sets the tone for the show perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is mostly comprised of low-key string pieces, and can best be described as charming for its gentle, sincere simplicity. It can get a bit repetitive, a good portion of the soundtrack is comprised of several different instrumentations of the same basic piece, but perhaps due to the series' short length it never wears out its welcome. I've seen longer anime get away with worse, so really I have no complaints.\\n\\n\r\nThere's one thing about anime voice acting in Japan that makes it perfectly suited to this kind of show, and that's their willingness to fill their child roles with real children. It does happen in the States occasionally (Aaron Dismuke as Alphonse Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist comes to mind immediately) but it's not nearly as common. Rin, her friend Kouki, her cousin Reina and several minor child characters are all played by age-appropriate voice actors, which makes them sound genuine as only real children can. Ayu Matsuura in particular does a great job as Rin, and I wouldn't be surprised to hear more from her in the years to come as she grows and matures into new roles. The adults sound pretty good too, at least to my ears. The lack of a dub does create a problem for some potential viewers, though, which is unfortunate because otherwise I'm fairly confident I can recommend this series to just about anyone.\\n\\n\r\nBunny Drop is first and foremost an emotional series. It's a pretty consistently upbeat series but it never goes too far into \"flowery sunshine and rainbows\" territory. This show works because of how true it is to the small, understated moments that a parent and child really do share every day. These moments never feel unnecessary because Daikichi is as new to Rin and to parenting as we are (unless, y'know, you're already a parent), so we get to discover these things as he does. Both Daikichi and Rin have time to develop in small, believable ways and build a realistic family relationship. Daikichi is always well-meaning, and you never doubt he's suited to raise Rin, but he does run into a lot of problems that he overcomes with believable difficulty. Rin, meanwhile, is a well-mannered girl who is in some ways wise beyond her years, but she still faces common everyday problems for a child her age like wetting the bed, and she confronts these problems as any child would, so even when she acts a bit old for her age you never forget she's six. The two of them complement each other sweetly but never come across as saccharine--no small feat. They're not particularly complex characters, but they're still charming and memorable, and feel like real people rather than archetypes.\\n\\n\r\nActually, \"charming\", \"memorable\" and \"real\" are good ways to describe the entire cast. From Daikichi's family to Rin's playmates, they all act remarkably true to the people we could really meet at these various stages in our lives. The show uses its surprisingly large cast to its full advantage, with every character acting as a foil to Daikichi and Rin in some way or another. For example, there's Daikichi's mother Sachiko, who's already been through everything Daikichi is going through right now, and his sister Kazumi, who's on the cusp of starting a family of her own. Both of them initially question Daikichi's decision, but after warming up to Rin and reflecting on their own lives we do see them change for the better in little ways. The lessons are simple but important ones, and they come across naturally through everyday interactions rather than being crammed down our throats.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one character in this series who deserves special mention, though, it's Masako, the mother who abandoned Rin with her father. When Daikichi meets her, she's nothing like he expects her to be, and it turns out her reasons for leaving Rin are more complex than pure apathy. She's focused on her own career and not at all suited to being a mother, but despite her efforts to distance herself she can't help but care about Rin in her own way. She doesn't feel that she was ready to be a mother, and maybe she's right, but that doesn't make her a bad person. That the show managed to portray her in such a light is probably its greatest achievement, and the closest the series comes to delving into the dark side of parenthood. Her character arc is so good, in fact, that it casts the show's greatest flaw into sharp relief.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, Bunny Drop falls into a bit of a comfort zone, in that it's severely limited in its thematic and emotional spectrum. Not that it doesn't bring anything meaningful to the table, but the picture it paints of parenthood is a little too rosy to encompass the full experience. Daikichi never really messes up, the little mistakes he make and the details that slip through the cracks are quickly forgiven and forgotten, and many of the difficulties he and Rin might have to face are discussed but never actually portrayed, such as the possibility that Rin might be teased for her family circumstances. Am I being too cynical? Perhaps, but it's arcs like Masako's that prove that the show can strive for something more without sacrificing its purity and sincerity; Masako wasn't in the right, exactly, but what she did was still understandable, sympathetic even, and it shed light on some truths about parenthood that are rarely addressed. The show needed more material like that, but aside from that one arc and a pretty powerful opening episode (the scene where Daikichi takes Rin home is actually a great moment), Bunny Drop systematically dodged every opportunity to become something more. I mentioned Daikichi's mother earlier, and on a whole I didn't dislike her character, but one thing that bothered me was that even after she warmed up to Rin she never apologized for treating her so coldly early on. That's something the show would have been better for confronting rather than tiptoeing around it the way it did, and this series does quite a lot of tiptoeing in its short run.\\n\\n\r\nWhat we're left with is a rather baffling creation. Bunny Drop is primarily a feel-good anime, but I can't write it off as meaningless fluff. It does have some genuine depth and weight to it, and it's true to life in its portrayal of the joys of family, but a limited scope does take its toll on the series. The final episode is just like every other episode: nothing particularly powerful, conclusive or poignant, life just goes on. Perhaps that's for the best, as I've had the ending to the source manga spoiled for me and it does not sound like a good direction to take the story, but even if the inconclusive ending we got was preferable that certainly doesn't make it good. Not that it's bad, mind you, it's certainly better than seeing it try for something conclusive only to fall flat on its face. Still, the series as a whole never really strives for greatness, and that's too bad. To be fair, maybe too much weightiness would have damaged the series' charming tone, so I can't fault it too much. Some anime just aren't meant to be great, and for what it is Bunny Drop is still undeniably good.\\n\\n\r\nBunny Drop is a gentle, extremely lovable look at parenting and family. It's not a grand or complex or particularly thought-provoking story, nor is it the peak of what slice of life anime can achieve, but it is sincere from start to finish, with hardly single beat that rings false in the entire show. Lack of a dub notwithstanding I think this is something even non-anime fans can enjoy. I recommend it wholeheartedly. Watch it, enjoy it, maybe you'll get more out of it than I did.",

Over time they begin to have a real father-daughter bond and both love each other greatly. Showing a realistic approach to how children act in this anime, it's something everyone can relate to and genuine enjoy to watch a family grow and love each other.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters being a key role in any slice of life, this has one of the best character development and realism in each of them. They all have a realistic personality that anyone can relate to such as panicking when their child is ill for the first time, meeting new parents and wishing your kid to have a good day.\\n\\n\r\nYou're introduced to Rin, a girl who is quiet and shy towards the rest of the family at the start of the anime. Through the bonding with Daikichi and her new parent, she gets to be introduced to each family member along the way and truly starts to love each and one of them as real significant people in her life. She's a normal girl with trust issues at first and problems that every child goes through, such as wetting the bed. She's mature for her age, but still childish in many points. \\n\\n\r\nNext we have Daikichi, he's a middle aged man who has no experience with children, but takes Rin into his home with open arms and learns as the time goes on. With the role of being a parent, he learns a lot about taking care of children and the habits of being one. He soon starts to focus on Rin and asks for a job position change so he can get off work earlier just to pick her up.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is something that really compliments the mood of the anime in a way that gives it a childish feeling, but also giving off a warm feeling through the entire anime. The scenery was always nice to look at and made it really nice with the light color palette that the anime has. All the characters are given really nice detail with their facial structure and nothing is overly emphasized. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening is a really cute song that supports the theme of family. The background music always fit each scene regardless if it was supposed to be a comedic scene or a serious scene. Along side the great characters you have wonderful voice actors to give them life and bring more to the table to offer. With Rin they used an actual kid as a voice actor which gave the anime a whole better sound to it rather than the usual adult voice actor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is an anime that is very realistic to which anyone can relate to. The concept of family and learning parent hood is something that is often overlooked and rushed with people today. The character development is very true to their personality and lets them shine from start to end to make a heartfelt anime that any true slice of life fan would enjoy. I recommend this to anyone who's looking for something relaxing and adorable to watch!",

            "content": "\u201cGive me more episodes!\u201d\r\nThat was how if felt by the end of the series. There was just something magical about the series and it started to grow on me. I started off appreciating the show but not really enjoying it, but by the last episode I could not help but feel that another season of this series would be something nice to have.\r\nGoing home from his grandfather\u2019s funeral, thirty-year-old Daikichi is floored to discover that the old man had an illegitimate child with a younger lover. The rest of his family is equally shocked and embarrassed by this surprise development, and not one of themwants anything to do with the silent little girl, Rin Kaga. In a fit of anger, Daikichi decides to take her in himself. As Daikichi nurtures Rin, he started to understand the struggle while at the same time the joy of parenting.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are realistic and are characters that you would be able to relate to. As such, you feel a bigger impact of each episode\u2019s situations and you feel like you are part of that family as they go through their times of trouble when adjusting to the life of parenthood.\\n\\n\r\nDaikichi is a salary man who has spent his life as a single 30+ years old male without much thought about the future and thus struggles with life as a parent when it is suddenly thrust upon him. His character is so confused when it comes to most of the things regarding childcare and is essentially just taking things as they come which always makes it a fun to watch when he suddenly realises some of the simple things that are important to a kid.\\n\\n\r\nRin takes on the role as the \u201cmature/wiser\u201d child who still retains her immaturity despite her maturity. She reminds me of kids who have gone through a lot and thus are wiser than the other kids around her age yet her behaviors and knowledge when it comes to things are still that of a kid. I think that is a good thing because that is essentially what her character is meant to be and her complicated past reflects in her behaviour and attitude. If only kids were like that these days. Oh how times have changed.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are also interesting to watch. Each of them have their own unique personality that are once again very nicely executed and easy to relate to.\\n\\n\r\nI love the pastel tones that are used for this show as it really gives that gentle and soft feeling that compliments the style of the show very well. \\n\r\nThe character designs take some getting used to since they are not similar to the generic style which our eyes would be used to but they are also not too drastically different.\\n\\n\r\nThe one slight flaw of the show is the music, and while it is not bad, it is not memorable. It works as a part of the series, but the opening, ending and all the music in between do not stay with you long. That is probably just as well because what should stay with you after watching Usagi Drop is the show, and perhaps the music is an intentional after-thought.\\n\\n\r\nAt eleven episodes, you really don't have an excuse to not watch this series. Usagi Drop will make you cry, it will make you laugh, and it will make you believe that there are beautiful things in this world and help you hope for a better tomorrow for all those who are shoved to the margins by society. I can't give this series a high enough recommendation, but it should suffice to say that you need to watch this show and hope that more studios are willing to break the mold in the future.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a relaxing, gentle family drama series that will leave you with a heartwarming feeling at the end of each episode. To me, \u2018relaxing\u2019 would be the key word to describe this series.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing over-the-top when it comes to this show and it is simply just a good and enjoyable series to watch during your off time.\\n\\n\r\nRin, why you such an awesome child?!",

            "content": "Japan has a declining birth rates in the past 10 years, and Otaku(s) is one of the reason. Most of their people refuse to have a child since it will be make their life more complicated. This series was aimed at the ones who always thinks like that, and hoping they will change their mind after watching this series. Usagi Drop showed the world how beautiful your life with a child, explained perfectly how a child can colors your house and living room.\r\nIt doesn\u2019t have supernatural things, it doesn\u2019t have action fighting, it doesn\u2019t have high quality comedies, it doesn\u2019t have over dramatic story, andit also doesn\u2019t have romantic story, yet I still find it brilliant. How? The writer just keep the story simple and interesting consistently. Usagi Drop is a proof that genre is a very subjective view to assess a story quality. The most important thing is to make the story interesting consistenly, always keep it simple and interesting. I believe there\u2019s no bad written script on the story, the writer keeps the conversation and background story as simple as possible, and it made this story is so easy to understand and fun to follow. The relationship between Daikichi and Rin is a relationship that everyone will adore whoever you\u2019re.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop is a rare adult-story anime. Usually, an anime that aimed to the more mature audience is mostly about sex, murder, torture, psychological freak, and other negative vibes. I honestly think Japan should\u2019ve make and adapts this kind of anime more often, I know it probably doesn\u2019t sell very well, but it\u2019s important to teach people more about humanity.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop may be aimed at more mature audience, but I would recommend this to everyone, no matter how old you are. It doesn\u2019t only showed us about how beautiful a family life is, but it also teach us about how to have a better life, and know what to prioritize.",

            "content": "Usagi Drop started out as a manga by Unita Yumi. The anime adaptation was handled by Production I.G. It's also the second Josei series I've been asked to review. The other being Nodame Cantabile. Let's take a look at Usagi Drop and see how it compares.\r\nThe story follows a man named Daikichi who goes to his grandfather's funeral only to discover that his grandfather had an illegitimate child named Rin. His family treats her like a nuisance, which angers him so he makes a snap decision to take custody of her. You know, like all of those other stories where someone without kids is somehowforced into looking after one. The anime follows the two in their daily lives as they grow closer and as Daikichi uncovers information about Rin's past. There's really not much in terms of an actual story. The biggest negative is just that the series is largely boring. A bunch of ordinary events like a kindergarten graduation or visiting family may be a natural part of life, but they don't make for an interesting or compelling narrative. Not unless there are some really spectacular characters behind them, but I'll get to that in a bit. The most tension you get is that Rin comes down with the flu for all of an episode. The series tries to maintain a humorous tone most of the time, but most of the jokes aren't really funny. They're just like those stories that  some parents tell about their kid doing something kind of stupid that the parent finds hilarious but no one else actually cares about because it's not really funny but you feel compelled to fake a laugh to be polite. To give the series some credit, there are some cute moments and Daikichi's search for Rin's mother is kind of interesting. It also avoids the cheesy romance plot that usually comes with \"single person is compelled to look after a kid and discovers the 'joys' of parenthood\" stories.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the characters. The kids in this act like actual children which translates to them being pretty obnoxious most of the time. The only real exception is Rin, who's, thankfully, the one we spend the most time with. She can be annoying at times, but most of the time she's mature in enough ways to be tolerable. Most of the adult characters are just kind of boring. They spend a lot of their time focusing on their kids, which kind of reminds me of some people I've known who were interesting before they had kids but won't shut up about their kids now that they've had them and aren't interesting anymore. Now, before you send me a bunch of angry messages, I'm not saying all parents are like that. I'm specifically talking about parents who don't have interests outside of being parents or don't seem to since all they ever talk about is their children. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this is kind of sketchy. The opening scenes for every episode have this kind of chalky unfinished look and then it transitions into a more complete look. Initially I thought that they'd just run out of time and hadn't been able to completely finish, but after a few episodes it became clear that it was just a very odd stylistic decision. They also have some very strange moments where the character's faces convert to a very minimalistic style which I think is done as an attempt at humour, but I'm not sure since it can be hard to discern what's supposed to be funny and what's just whimsical. The backgrounds tend to be pretty plain. Most of the time the characters and various objects do look pretty nice though. The flora especially. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast in this is decent enough. Although not really anything special. the music is kind enough to play an effect most of the time something funny is supposed to have happened. Which is kind of weird. Did they just know the material wasn't going to actually be funny and having a character hold a sign saying \"laugh\" would've been too obvious? The music is pretty fitting for the series. It's slow and soft. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 1/10. Most of the focus is on six year olds so it makes sense that there's not yuri in this. \\n\\n\r\nSo, that's Usagi Drop. Honestly, I'm not in the demographic for this since my general reaction to children can best be summed up as \"meh.\" It's a mostly light-hearted and very dull series. There's nothing egregiously wrong with it, but you probably aren't going to be entertained by it unless you really like children. For myself, I give it a 5/10. Meh.",

Please don't call the cops.\r\nStory:\r\nA 30 years old man \"adopts\" a six year old girl out of pity and has to live with the consequences of suddenly becoming a \"father\". That is technically all there is to it, but it is more than enough to work with. After all, the life of a child is full of events, a lot is changing and on top of that, we have 2 characters who have their lives turned upside down from one day to the next. All this is shown through Daikichis eyes, which is the perspective I canrelate to a lot more. It also makes Usagi Drop as sweet as a candy cane. This is slice of life done right, a little bit of drama here and there but ultimately a ride of fuzzy feelings and smiles. The only downside is that it's way to short with only 11 episodes.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nDespite being focussed on a cute little girl, the anime does not fall into \"moe territory\". It is cute and simplistic, but nowhere near the point where you could get the feeling it is forced. Being a story about children, Usagi Drop is bright and colorful, which fits this show very well. I also liked to see some normal looking adults for a change, you rarely have that in anime either.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening theme is kinda childish, fitting the anime well (fitting seems to be the major word of this review) and it is pretty catchy. Yet, it is not that great in my eyes, but as I mentioned in other reviews, this may just be a case of me having a very different taste in music. Pretty much the same goes for the ending. Something Usagi Drop really shines in though is the voices. Rin is voiced by an actual child, making her sound very convincing, but the others aren't bad either. Soundtrack is spare but never distracting.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe main selling point of this anime. Rin is the most adorable child you will ever see (spoiler: your child will not be this well-behaved) and it is pure joy seeing her grow from the shy little thing in episode one to the happy, normal kid in episode 11. Daikichi does a really good job being a father for her. His initial decision was pretty crazy from a realistic point of view, but he knows this as well and keeps improving to make Rins world a better place. The rest of the cast was okay, none of them stood out as special, but I guess that was not the point of Usagi Drop anyway.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI have a working day of about 8\u00bd hours plus 1\u00bd-2 hours of driving. When I get home, I just wanna relax and have some fun. When I tuned into my daily dose of Rin, I felt at peace. It made me think that life is good. To watch a child grow up can really be all the joy you'll ever need and I think I can finally understand parents who give up everything for this one little thing.\\n\r\nOkay, that was very cheesy, I apologise.\\n\r\nUsagi Drop will give you a good feeling, wether you like children or not. As long as you don't mind the slice of life genre, you should definitely take a look at this.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n9.0/10",

            "content": "Raising a child isn't easy, and every parent or guardian knows just how taxing all of the daily tasks can be, the sacrifices that need to be made in terms of work and social life, and the almost constant stream of considerations and worries. The truth is that looking after children is one of the biggest causes of stress and grey hairs (or hair loss), amongst adults, but given that the majority of people in the world are (or will be), parents, it's a little odd that such a major topic is still a rarity in anime.\r\nThe again, who wants to watch a show aboutthe trials and tribulations of raising children, especially when the steady diet of fanservice, explosions, brainless muscular heroes, top heavy heroines, nonsensical plots, pseudo-psychology, quantum-hokum, etc, are apparently what passes for entertainment these days. It's a sad fact that in a medium where literally any story can be told, the ones that may actually cast anime in a positive light are constantly overlooked or ignored completely.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is why Usagi Drop is such a rarity.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted from the josei manga by Unita Yumi, the story begins with Kawachi Daikichi, a 30 year old salesman who has returned home to attend a family funeral. During his stay he finds out that his deceased grandfather had an illegitimate daughter called Kaga Rin. Nobody knows who the girl's mother is, so the family begin arguing over who will raise her until Daikichi, who has become increasingly annoyed and disgusted by their behaviour, asks Rin if she wants to live with him.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop is one of those uncommon adaptations where the anime has tried to stay true to the source material, and while that does place a number of limitations on it, the series also manages to retain the charm of the manga. The story develops at a measured pace that can sometimes feel a little slow, and there's a surprising lack of over the top melodrama that is so often a hallmark of shows like this. The plot takes a much more mature approach to the issue of parenting than one might initially expect, and while certain problems that Daikichi is faced with are specific to Japanese society, the overall theme is one that will resonate with anyone who has raised children.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is also the reason why some viewers may not enjoy this anime, but we'll get to that in a bit.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the story, the artwork also tries to stay as true as possible to the source material. The characters are depicted in a stylized form, and the rather simplistic approach to emotions is surprisingly expressive. The design is focused on showing each person as an individual not only facially, but also in their build, posture, and even their movements. The animation is fluid, if a little utilitarian at times, and it's clear that attention has been paid to each character's physical traits and personalities. In addition to this each episode is preceded and concluded by short, but rather charming scenes that are notable for the watercolour style palette that is used in them. The dichotomy between these scenes and the style and colouration used in the main body of the narrative adds a nice, almost picture book touch to proceedings.\\n\\n\r\nBetween these shorts and the story proper lie the opening and ending sequences, both of which are designed with children's paintings in mind. The opening theme, \"Sweet Drop\" by Puffy AmiYumi (yes, they of Teen Titans and Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi fame), is a surprisingly well suited J-pop song that's very much in keeping with Rin's character. In contrast to this the ending theme, \"High High High\" by Kasarinchu (a pop duo consisting of a beatboxer and a guitarist/singer), is more reflective of the overall atmosphere of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the background music, Usagi Drop features a variety of tracks that are generally quite mellow or upbeat, but every so often the score is punctuated by a slow, simple piano piece to highlight the more sensitive moments of the story.\\n\\n\r\nNow it's a trite thing to say that good acting can bring any type of story to life and give it the feeling of something new and different, but in this case it's actually a true statement. The simple yet natural script allows the seiyuu far more room to express themselves than one might expect, and with little in the way of manufactured melodrama, all of the cast (especially the child actors), are able to deliver some truly worthwhile performances.\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting character in Usagi Drop is, without a doubt, Kawachi Daikichi. Part of the reason for this is because much of the story is told from his perspective, but he's also one of the most defined adult male leads in anime to date. From the start he is shown to be a complete individual with his own thoughts, habits and values, and rather than trying to develop him, the narrative is more focused on evolving him through his relationship with Rin, and the problems, worries and sacrifices he works through in order to be a good parent.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand Rin is very much how one would expect a child of her age to be - inquisitive, precocious, and somewhat withdrawn around people she doesn't know well. As with Daikichi, she doesn't really develop as a character, but instead what the viewer is shown is a little girl who is slowly coming to terms with her new life and coming out of her shell. Now this is surprising as it's a clear message about how resilient children actually are and how they are able to cope as long as they know they have the support of the adults who care for them.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of support, aside from the two leads there are a surprising number of well written characters in Usagi Drop, both adults and children, and it's their presence in the story that really rounds out the whole thing. The particularly strong friendship between Nitani Kouki and Rin for example, or the slightly befuddled attraction between Daikichi and Kouki's mother Yukari, all add to the overall charm of the series. In addition to this, one of the things that really stands out about Usagi Drop is the lack of angst where relationships are concerned. While there are events like the death of Daikichi's grandfather, these don't cast a pall over the narrative, and this allows for some interesting interactions and dynamics to emerge, the prime example of this being the bond that develops between the two lead characters.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop is a simple, straightforward and charming tale about what it means to be a parent, and while the story and characters are presented in an ideal form, this doesn't really detract from one's enjoyment of the show. It goes without saying that anyone who has experience of raising children will be able to relate more readily to a number of the themes in the show, but it should be pointed out that the plot is simple enough to allow anyone to enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us back to why some people won't like this series.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the sometimes slow pace, the main theme of the show is one that many younger fans (and even a few older ones), may not like, especially if their penchant is for action, heavy melodrama, etc. On the surface it can seem as though Usagi Drop is nothing more than another lighthearted slice of life drama that's only different from the likes of Aishiteruze Baby because a full fledged adult is cast in the role of parent instead of a teenaged playboy, but there's more to the show than that.\\n\\n\r\nThe simple fact is that this anime is one of those rare titles that doesn't use the word \"mature\" as a marker for violence, gore, sexual content, etc, and this makes it almost unique when one considers the shows that have been released this past year. The emphasis on realism, albeit in an idealized form, may also be a factor as there are a few people out there who want pure fantasy and escapism.\\n\\n\r\nWhatever your opinion or taste, one thing remains true - Usagi Drop is clearly aimed at a more mature audience than the norm. The fact that it doesn't demean the creators with pointless gore, violence or fanservice, or insult the viewer's intelligence by explaining everything that happens, are what sets it apart from many other slice of life shows out there.",

Well, because this show did so much right that it\u2019s tough not to be. Usagi Drop stayed true to the essence of the manga (before the timeskip) and didn\u2019t stray far, if at all, from the original story progression. It captured splendidly the little nuances of an abnormal parent-child reality.\r\nOur lives are full of insignificancies. Waking up irritable and half alert, washing your teeth, brushing your face, fumbling to find your valuables, grocery shopping without a list. The shit we wade through daily but clean up and forget soon after. These are experiences almost all can relateto but never share with one another because it\u2019s stuff not worth sharing. Then of course, spliced in between those bits of irrelevance are the undoubtedly meaningful moments to be remembered. And we want to save those precious moments by documenting them. It\u2019s in our nature to try and preserve the best times of our lives in some form or another. So when something like Usagi Drop comes along that personifies \u2018life\u2019, in both the boring and the beautiful, we\u2019re able to really connect with the characters and their story on a more personal level. \\n\\n\r\nRin is modest, caring, independent, and responsible. She\u2019s very mature but then not without those traits which you find ever-present in kids around her age. Joyful, curious, and downright adorable! In terms of lovability, she\u2019s on par with Ushio in my book. You just want to squeeze those little cheeks and embrace her till she dies of asphyxiation. She\u2019s that HNNNGGable. Needless to say, her expressions are genuine signs of love and appreciation, even for something like a poor attempt at tying pigtails. How she feels shows on her face clear as a sunny day. And the window through which we get to see all these sides of her is Daikichi.\\n\\n\r\nDaikichi\u2019s a very straightforward guy, both in personality and appearance. On top of that, he\u2019s nurturing, compassionate, and protective. A little awkward at times but it comes with the job. Not to say I don\u2019t like my dad, I love him, but Daikichi is the kind of father I wished I\u2019d had growing up. He juggles his new responsibilities well with work and still manages to maintain a good relationship with everyone around him. Standing in as a guardian for your past grandfather\u2019s illegitimate kid probably isn\u2019t easy so I think he deserves a break here and there for his goofups. Watching Daikichi is a true breath of fresh air what with all the high school/university kids hogging most of the attention in anime. What you get is a middle aged guy just trying to do his best to provide for himself and his new little house warmer.\\n\\n\r\nTWO little house warmers considering the frequency of Kouki\u2019s visits. He and his mother are two more people you\u2019ll find to be endearing as they interact with Rin and Daikichi. Aside from his apparent cheekiness, Kouki\u2019s a good kid and it shows in his submissive yet protective behavior towards Rin. Looking at their close friendship and the overt chemistry between Yukari and Kawachi, it\u2019s quite easy to envision them becoming a family in the near future. In fact, beyond the show\u2019s conclusion you could say they\u2019re already family.\\n\\n\r\nAnd because of the relatively fluid art and animation, we\u2019re able to see how they become so close. Soft watercolour-esque scenes start out each episode before the opening song rolls. It\u2019s really a nice way of preceding the bulk of the episode. Character designs are markedly simplistic but there\u2019s no need to fuss over it. With some added touches of realism, it\u2019s nice knowing they do change clothes each day and night and that Daikichi does grow a stubble if he doesn\u2019t shave every day like any other grown man. The backgrounds are subtle yet detailed; from pavement cracks to packaged market meat, everything in view is easy on the oculars.\\n\\n\r\nTo supplement the animation is the writing which shines through in the dialogue. Ayu and Tsuchida\u2019s performance as the voices of Rin and Daikichi leave little more to be asked for. Thanks to them and all the other seiyuus, the talking that goes on in the show becomes one of its strengths. For example, in one episode, Daikichi and Harumi, Reina\u2019s mom, have a serious discussion about Harumi\u2019s marital problems which is eavesdropped on by Rin. But noticing this, Reina takes her aside and shows her how she copes when mom and dad don\u2019t get along. Not something seen every day, you get both the child and parent\u2019s perspectives of when things aren\u2019t going so smoothly at home. Really, kids are keen in times like that and it\u2019s great to see that the anime picks up on this detail. And it\u2019s not only those I\u2019ve listed who have depth of character but everyone has their own charm about them and grows, if just a little, in their own way in the span of only a year.\\n\\n\r\nNow soundwise, the piano melodies and environmental acoustics fit well with whatever present surroundings were onscreen. The opening/ending songs are two very cheery jingles. Catchy it was but not enough to my taste to warrant a replay every week. Though, I would\u2019ve never known that the group who did the opening is the same group who did the Teen Titans theme song (one of my favorites) had I not looked it up. Nostalgia, woo! From their tower they can see that all together, the music worked in pacing the way scenes played out.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop was an engagingly heartfelt tale of an atypical family living and learning how to adjust to their odd circumstances and the intricacies it affords. It handled themes like the importance of family values and the trials of child raising with great consideration for its audiences. \\n\\n\r\nDespite its title I advise against dropping this anime because sitting down to watch Rin and Daikichi go through child/parenthood is an experience to be cherished. And I, for one, certainly have.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Secretly funded by the Japanese government to combat declining birth rates, project \"USAGI DROP\" targeted a very specific, generally non-reproductive demographic of the Japanese population: the otaku. At the core of the project was a 11 episode television series that was specifically designed to thoroughly rouse hibernating paternal instincts. Researchers noted a 41% increase in the desire to have children in males in their 20s to 30s who watched a single episode of Usagi Drop. Researchers also noted that of that 41%, 77% of those males explicitly stated that they wanted daughters. One of the biggest advantages project USAGI DROP had over its predecessor, projectMINDLESS ECCHI is that it instilled the desire to propagate in its viewers rather than the desire to merely fornicate. Researchers of the project also documented what later became termed as the \"Usagi Drop effect;\" after watching an episode of Usagi Drop, viewers would often ramble off a list of random names before being able to engage in proper conversation. After a conducting several widespread interviews, researchers discovered that these ramblings were the external symptoms of an internal debate that was common among all viewers of Usagi Drop; the viewers consistently tried to decide what name they wanted to bestow on their offspring after watching an episode of Usagi Drop. After these very promising test results, the Japanese Government gave the project the green light and the anime aired in the Summer of 2011. They are expecting great returns in nine months.",

            "content": "I have watched every single slice-of-life anime since 2005 and Usagi Drop still manages to easily stand out. A good amount of slice of life shows focus on pumping high school girls full of moe and or filling their daily lives with excessive drama and irrationally difficult people. Usagi Drop, however, portrays itself in stark contrast; unforced, un-contrived, and totally natural, the show manages to make its characters and events truly heartwarming without having to resort to overcoming some out-of-place difficulty or killing off characters.\r\nNow more than half-way into the season at episode 6, all the characters have managed to display a definite depth ofpersonality and emotion that most other shows never achieve. Daikichi, his mom, his sister, Rin, Haruko, and even the controversial Masako all refuse to be classified down into silly anime stereotypes. Though they each have their own problems in life, they all manage to radiate a heartwarming and real aura. In their actions and words the mature audience can easily spot a heartfelt kindness and the tender je ne sais quoi of life. The characters are, in fact, more than just characters in some story.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd although Usagi Drop still holds an intrinsically touching storyline, it delivers it in pleasant harmony with its characters, its art, and its background music. The audience is transported into the somewhat daunting life of a single Japanese salary-man and sudden father. Yet despite this bleakness, we see the world of Daikichi and Rin as a place filled warmth and a firm sense of family. The chorus of music in the background, neither harkening doom nor hollering gloom, is instead a duet of simplicity, playfulness, and nostalgia. The environmental BGM seeks to neither to overshadow nor contradict the characters, but instead augment gentle Daikichi's kindness, precocious Rin's sweetness, energetic Gotou's friendliness, etc. \\n\\n\r\nNext, the opening theme, Sweet Drops by Puffy, is a touch of crayon magic mixed with a well-performed song that perfectly captures the pure and innocent love so subtly themed throughout the show. This show is quickly leaving the realm of simple afternoon entertainment and entering the realm of heartwarming artwork.",

            "content": "To be Frank, I was skeptical about committing to watching Usagi Drop having read all the manga. Adaptations are great and all, but boy oh boy the direction source material (manga) took didn't sit well with me, leaving me doubtful about this as a whole.\r\nNow, I can safely say I'm glad to have watched this amazing experience. \r\nSo how do I describe and score Usagi Drop? Well, this happens to be one of those shows where numbers just won't do, and an in-depth analysis is quite frankly overkill. I can talk all I want about what it's about; the premise, the execution, the pacing; noneof this will do it justice. But heck, I'll give it a shot just for you. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\\n\r\nWe follow our Main \"protagonist\" Karachi Daikichi, a single 30 year old man whose grandfather has recently passed away. At his grandfather's funeral, he meets his grandfather's  daughter, Kaga Rin; age 6. \\n\\n\r\nHmm.... Ok... So this little girl is his....\\n\\n\r\nMoving along, Both the two meet and under the rather dreary atmosphere of mourning adults, Daikichi takes Rin under his wing and thus begins Daikichi's new life as a parent. \\n\\n\r\nPretty basic premise... Meh, not really. Transition into parenting/parenthood is a topic RARELY touched on in anime. Why? Doesn't sell... Anyways, the story focuses heavily on Daikichi's and Rin's new life, how they adapt, perceive, and going about the day. Now, remember, Daikichi has been a single 30 year old working and drinking constantly, having only to care and feed for one person. Let's add another expense to deduct from your income... Don't forget, kids have soccer (football) games and stuff. Better to make some time in my already dreadfully unflexible schedule..\\n\\n\r\nGet the picture? Good, but ultimately, the story only moves forward with each new experience both Rin and Daikichi undergo. With that, we see that as time goes on,  they change and develop.\\n\r\nAs far as pacing goes, it's relatively slow paced... Then again, with an awkward number of 11 episodes, this seems appropriate. Each episode never seems rushed.. Scratch that, each scene never seems rushed. The story isn't overly complex, so holes aren't an issue. All in all, the only word to describe the story is simple, and that isn't such a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nFans could give this a 10, those without a heart could name it plotless. Depending on what you're expecting, it could go either way.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis was a surprise considering Production I.G touched this one up. If we look at Production IG's other works, we see something completely different from what you see here. Please be aware, this is a pleasant surprise. Thumbs up on this one.\\n\\n\r\nThe show comes off as.. Rather childish, but it isn't that big of a deal considering that kids are involved in the story after all. In fact, the art is rather fitting, and in those few moments throughout the show, I stared in awe at the magnificently drawn and animated scenes. This might be a surprise because the art is so simplistic. Character design, lighting,  the background. Nothing held extraordinary detail except, again, in those few moments of high interest and excitement, although \"excitement\" isn't so appropriate to describe this.\\n\\n\r\nI must compliment the pastel, water color-y (forgive me as I am uneducated in accurate art terminology) scenes through out the series. It's very different than what many people are probably used to seeing on the current market.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, because of how boldly the art is presented, the different art style showing off as strongly as it does might end up being a miss for many.\\n\\n\r\nSo how do I sum up the art? Like the story. Simple, but sweet, with a touch of magnificent sprinkled in. It isn't Shinkai breathtaking, but it's pretty dang close in many scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 \\n\\n\r\nCharacter voices are appropriate for the whole cast. I might have a problem with only one character, but she's completely overlook able in comparison to everyone else. The sound track was well done, though Unmemorable. Heck, everything was done satisfactorily here as the pleasant background music compliments the \"feel good\" atmosphere. The music even addresses the more dramatic scenes with ease. The OP and ED are nothing too special, but very fitting to the theme of Bunny Drop.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nNow, this may seem like a slice of life show, and it is, but the abnormal time frame this series has is rather stressing to many viewers for many reasons. For example, many short series fail to develop their characters since, like in life, time is limited, so rushed plots and such can hurt the cast as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Usagi Drop nails that instinctive preconception to the ground. With only two main characters and very well planned out execution and pacing, there is a feeling of satisfaction by watching Rin and Daikichi grow. Heck, we even see there is more to the support roles than what we are presented prior to the next time they make an appearance. The show addresses how Daikichi feels and grows quite clearly, which then leads the viewer to imply a few thing about Rin. While Rin arguably is very static, we must realize that she is a 6 year old. A child whose mind is still in development. Realistic? Appropriate? Do you have a problem with this ideally perfect little girl? Stuff your whining and refresh your perspectives.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the show, I came to realize what a delight It was to watch Daikichi & Rin grow as characters as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nA rare delight and one of the best shows of 2011. It's hard to explain why this anime was so successful. The story is a heartwarming one, packed with many little lessons on ethics and such. Perhaps our reaction to the characters and their interactions came off as hilarious. Going into the show, you might find plenty of the characters relatable even. Perhaps this caused me to reflect on my childhood and outlook for my future. Usagi Drop offers something for everyone to relate to and enjoy.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\\n\r\nHopefully this gave you enough insight as to whether or no you should pick up Usagi drop. Be aware, the intended audience is a more older one, not really specifically targeting teens or younger audiences of the sort. Still, the show is appropriate for a broad audience. If you're looking for action, harem, a complex plot, you'll find none of that here. What exists before you is a really simple but sweet treasure that can be watched without being disappointed. I encourage you to give this show a shot at becoming what could be one of your favorites of all time. My only issue with this show is that it was given a measly and awkward 11 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts? It was far from perfect, but Usagi Drop did so many things right that it doesn't even matter.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this was helpful. \\n\\n",

            "content": "To: Anime Fans   \r\n   Since there is only one episode of this out and I can't speak for the whole thing, of course, but I do want people to know that this one, so far, is definitely worth watching and why I think in the future it will be well worth your time.\r\nFIRST RESPONSE (Literally minutes after finishing my first watch through of the first episode. I actually posted it as a comment then copied and pasted it here because I thought it fit well.)\r\n  Wow, simply beautiful and intriguing, this episode alone could stand on it's own. I knowthere's going to be more and that awesome but in retrospect it may not, hopefully will though, live up to what this has episode portrayed and what I expect to be the standard for the rest of this anime's duration. Overall it's a great set up to what could have a wonderful, touching, deep, story with vivid and evolving characters to bout. But that's to be seen; for now, my hopes are high.\\n\\n\r\n   Now for the review portion of this review.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: I don't want to say much into this regard as there has been only ONE episode but I can say confidently that it will be good...if not played out, but good never the less. I say this only because I have seen these types of anime before and if the birth mother is ever out of the picture to start then, naturally, she will re-enter the frame. But as a famous quote states, it's not the path you take but it's how you walk it. Ok that's not famous (I actually just made it up) but you get the picture. I read some complaints about how you don't know enough of the story and how people are feeling lost. My only response to that is...IT'S THE FIRST EPISODE! Give it time. If they revealed all at the start why would you watch it? Suspense is key to good ratings and they know this. I think they did a great job, but I'll talk about that later.  Moving right along,\\n\\n\r\nART: Now I'm no art major nor do I claim or want, no offense, to be one. As a person who can only draw stick figures, anything that has any sembalnce of resembalnce to reality is good (that's a tongue twister), does that make this anime good? Yes, to me at lest. I have seen plenty of anime and have come across ones that even I don't care for but the art style here really seems to flow with the feel of this show. It's calm and smooth. It's dull and faded. It's bright and happy. It's perfect, in my none expert's opinion. The art will add a level of feeling to the show that mere story or characters could bring (not saying those aren't equally as important). And so we're off to the next one,\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: ...? Um...Hmu.....I...no that's n...it's...I...well its sound. I have never really understood this one. The again I watch streaming anime so the sound quality is not on par all the time. But, I expect it's more for the action animes, the one with a lot going on and what not, but for this anime I am at a lose for words (I know! Me! Well actually you don't do you? O well) Lets just say the voice acting is stellar, as usual (SUBS NOT DUBS), anyway, the music all fits well, nothing played that seemed out of place or that distracted me in anyway from the anime and the goings ons. Moving ons,\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: Oh My God! (I know who types that out anymore?) That's just how excited I am to see how these characters will progress! The first episode did an amazing job at setting up each important character. Not letting on to much into anyone's past but giving enough background information so that you can feel a certain level of understanding towards most of them. Lets go down the list: \\n\r\n  Rin. Quiet and reserved, never went out of here way to defend or react to anything that happened, with one exception. She only had about 4 or 5 lines but actions speak louder then words (who said that? Hold up one second...to Google! Well I heard that Mark Twain said it, also that some old German writer coined it, also that a 5 year old said it as his first words. That was a pointless expedition, lets return to the review, shall we). The one exception that I mentioned earlier...um spoiler I guess...is when Daikichi asks if she wants to live with him and she runs to his side. Can't wait to see what changes she bring to Daikichi and herself. \\n\r\n  Daikichi. I was having troubles trying to pinpoint his specific character. At first I thought he was a loner and not socially aware, someone who throws them self into there work, that's how I justified a social loner getting a phone call in the beginning. But he acts and reacts to well in a social setting. So I moved to, not a social loner, but a self proclaimed loner, no matter what, I can tell he is a loner in some form or another. He was always segregated just a little bit from the group, even though they are his family, like sitting away from the table, actually noticing and paying attention to Rin, simple things that are both in his personality and his manner of speech. Cant wait to see how he changes, as fore-mentioned in the paragraph above. \\n\r\n  Haruko. I don't know why but I feel like she will become an important character later in the show (god I hope I'm not wrong here). I cant say much about her character as she had little lines and even less air time but her presence made an impact on me, though that was probably because her child was quiet prominent. I'm going to go out on a limb and say she will, most likely, be Daikichi's love interest; however, if they are related disregard all of this. I say this because there was no indication that she was related to Daikichi. I know she has a child but there was not the slightest inkling of mention to a husband. Though it troubles me why she was, at all, at the funeral. Also, Daikichi was caught starring at her. This is what probably peaked my interests. For know just note I said this and disregard it if I'm wrong.\\n\r\nIn summary (of the character portion) Rin is quiet, Daikichi a loner, and Haruko possibly a insectual love interest, all show great promise and I cant stress enough how much I can't wait to see their growth. \\n\\n\r\nI have high hopes, very high hopes. Don't let me down Usagi Drop.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Rin has the most adult face I have ever seen on an anime child. There normally so bubbly and cute but hers is stern, beautiful and elegant and reminds me of some other female (adult) character I've seen somewhere...can't quiet place it though. Also, disregard the ratings I just thought I had to rate it and it wont let me change it back to nothing so I set them to all 10's in expectation of my high hopes being fulfilled. \\n\\n\r\nFrom: Steve",

            "content": "God. I suppose this was best time in my life for me to watch this series. I just went through a lot of stress with family and this really helped me understand some of the things that go on when you're a parent, even a single parent. I'm not gonna say the cliche stuff like \"It's never easy being a parent.\" and I can't say anything from experience, as I am not a father or legal guardian. But I was raised by a single mother without a father in my life until 7 years ago.\r\nThis review is going to differ from my other reviews inthe fact that I can't really find anything that was wrong with the series. It was cute and it was heart warming. There was no action, that wasn't what the writer was going for, and that might push a few people away because a lot of people watch anime for an unrealistic story that goes away from what happens in reality. This series provides that realism that is missing in so many other series that I have seen. It is really nice to see a realistic series once in a while. The animation really fit the feel of the series.\\n\\n\r\nBut onto the other aspect that I loved. The characters. Mostly Rin. I loved Rin because i could relate to her. And she has made it up in the list of my favorite fiction characters for that reason. I also loved the Daikichi on the main fact that he took this 6 year old girl, whom he had never met before, into his home and raised her as a daughter. There are other characters I liked. Nitani reminding me of my own mother and Kouski reminding me of a few childhood friends.\\n\\n\r\nThis series really it hit it in the heart for me. It didn't cry, but I related to a lot of the things that happened in the series.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\r\nIf you want to watch a heart warming series. Watch this one. It doesn't have action, it's not overplayed. And all the characters feel more or less original and human.\\n\\n\r\n9/10",

            "content": "The 'Slice of Life' genre is presented best as two sides of the same coin: one side depicts naturalism - showing a parallel to the reality of an average person, whether that\u2019d be hardships through life lessons, growing up and facing the real world, or experiencing something for the first time that leaves you in awe, while the other displays mundane experiences lacking conflict and development for the story and characters, solely presented to 'tug the heartstrings' of a person. It's a challenging idea to demonstrate for a wide variety of audiences who have their own preferences of what 'Slice of Life' is, simply bythe fact that everyone is unique, and will experience different aspects of what life has to offer as they grow up. Usagi Drop, however, manages to do everything right that all Slice of Life anime should strive for; Showcasing realism told through a strong narrative. \\n\\n\r\nTired of unrealistic, teenage, school dramas that have predictable outcomes, lack of character development, cheesy romantic sequences, and excessive melodramatic encounters? Tired of fan service characters and scenes that have no purpose in being in an anime, or sequences that were solely made to make us feel bad on-purpose? I know I sure was. With the exception of shows like Mushishi, I never once really felt like Slice of Life was natural or displayed a true realistic outtake on life; always having a forced outcome on situation that could be easily solved without immoderate drama, shoving moe down our throats, or painting a greater, grander picture of something that's meant to be a far fetched philosophical outtake on life. Usagi Drop is nothing like this, hell, it\u2019s probably one of the most unique, heartwarming, and ambitious anime I\u2019ve watched this year.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop is about what it means to be a family, and how raising a child has its merits and challenges. We are presented with something that has a mature feeling about each situation Kawachi Daikichi, the main character, encounters when put to the task of raising Rin Kawa, his grandfather\u2019s illegitimate daughter, taxing his already stressful life of being a single, working man. Usagi Drop doesn\u2019t try to woe you with pretty aesthetics or complicated characters to analyze, it\u2019s trying to showcase an event in our lives that will happen to most people: parenthood; as well as time management, dealing with no duel income, stress when things don\u2019t go your way, and normal things that eventually pile up and happen to us.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop isn\u2019t just solely based on a parent\u2019s perspective of life though, we also get to witness what the children in the anime are feeling as well, with Rin specifically, on how losing a loved one and moving in with a stranger you just met from the same family has an effect on you psychologically. Presenting two perspectives on the same situation of starting a family is a sign of a strong narrative, as it can relate to two different types of people watching the anime to get a better idea on the greater thematic value the show displays through realistic scenarios each of these characters go through. Maturity in the story-telling is what made the immersion and enjoyment so much more enjoyable than your typical run-of-the-mill anime. Not once was disbelief suspended, nor did I have to go back to understand something that didn't make sense the first time around due to flawed logic. \\n\\n\r\nCharm in not only the story, but characters, is a frequent occurrence that makes Usagi Drop differentiate from majority of Slice of Life anime. Daikichi is the perfect example of how to write a realistic character, and in fact, a dad. With popular dad characters like Shou Tucker, Gendou Ikari, and Gamino, perspectives on what a fatherly figure is positively shown is a rare occurrence. Daikichi is a loving, compassionate, and hardworking fatherly figure that supports Rin\u2019s transition into his life and will go to any lengths he can to make sure she\u2019s comfortable and gets the proper necessities, while also spoiling her. Awkward and laid-back, but brimming with motivation and determination. Rin is a believable child character. With a side of independence and maturity, she also has a childish side to her who eventually learns to open up more and love her family that once shunned her. Masako, Rin\u2019s biological mother, takes the role as the typical \u2018I don\u2019t want anything to do with my child\u2019 role, but has a unique personality and traits of a stressful, mangaka workaholic who never could possibly have time to support Rin. The supporting characters, the Nitani family, are very similar to Daikichi and Rin with a single parent raising one child. Both the mother and Daikichi, as well as Kouki and Rin, become friends that help each other when dealing with later occurrences, while also learning from each other.\\n\\n\r\nScenes incorporating the right use of music to enhance the overall mood, as well as visuals to enrich the beauty of the anime were all very solid and consistent, never breaking off or diminishing in quality. While the anime is beautiful on its own, and setting up the mood helps make scenes and story telling more influential through visuals and sound, it's important to not pay too much attention to these sort of details in Usagi Drop's case, as what really shines is how the narrative and characters connect to make a grand experience of witnessing life.\\n\\n\r\nWhat kind of an effect did Usagi Drop leave on me? It made me realize the importance of family and how important it is to stay in touch with them. Falling outs with family members is tragic and unfortunate, or with loved one dying. It\u2019s a situation where you as an individual need others to help coupe with such feelings that friends may not be able to understand clearly as much as family members do. It made me realize how life is moving fast, and at any minute something can happen which can result in your entire perspective on life changed in an instant. Treasuring moments now instead of waiting for what\u2019s in store for the future will help you better understand what it means to live and start a family.  Now, I\u2019m not a father/parent, nor was I adopted. So I\u2019m sure that people who actually are can relate to Usagi Drop on another level. Even so, that didn\u2019t hinder my outcome on what the core message Usagi Drop was trying to showcase. Anyone can see the value and beauty in such a heartwarming, telling narrative, recommended for anyone who wants a realistic approach on what your future might be like when raising a child. \\n",

            "content": "Story:\r\nThere really isn't that much to say about Usagi Drop.It's a feel-good story about a man rediscovering/ or discovering for the first time on the true joys of life through the child rearing of his adoptive daughter, Rin. There isn't anything groundbreaking or particularly unique with the plot but it will definitely pull on your heartstrings and you'll come out out of the series with a simile on your face\r\n7/10\r\nArt:\r\nThe art-style of Usagi Drop is something that follows the original art-style from the manga faithfully and to put it bluntly its unique. Its a style of art different to the trends of modern anime butit has an innocent and whimsical joy that seems to capture the essence of the show . Though beware if you are something who judges an anime but this aspect can be hit or miss. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe Voice-Acting in this is spot-on for Rin, the voice-actor in the Japanese Dub did a fantastic job in capturing the lovable innocence whilst also not giving her that annoying vocal pitch that children tend to have in anime. The other voice-actors were decent, nothing really stood out and they did their jobs. The OP and the ED are adorable, especially that Opening which captures the innocent joy and love between the two main characters. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThis is where i think the anime shines. On a technical viewpoint, Usagi Drop is not the an artistic wonder but the characters that have been created and terrific. You feel like all of these characters are real, that their personalities and actions can all be attributed to something someone in that demographic would do. Rin, in my opinion is the stand out character, she mixes in that innocent joy without the grating annoyance of anime children. She simply is a joy to watch 10/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you can't already tell from my review that I love this anime, then well let me state it a secondary time. I love this anime, I had a great time watching it and its one of the few that I could be bothered to a) Marathon and b) Repeat Watch. Usagi Drop is not a technical masterpiece, don't watch it for stunning animation, deep philosophical story line or jaw-dropping sound; you watch this for its fleshed out characters and for those moments of just heart-tweaking joy. 9/10\\n",

            "content": "This is definitely a slice of life anime, yet something is different about it. The style both in the art and story telling is breathtakingly simple. It is the story of a 30 year old man who takes on the task of raising a child. A 6 year old girl no less. The child of his grandfather, his illegitimate child. \r\nUsagi drop presents us with a very simple yet complicated issue which plagues society daily. How does one deal with a child? How would you raise her and what do you teach her? How do you share memories with them that you do not bothhave? Children are smart, they can make a connection if you mention the simplest things, and there is nothing you can hide from them. How do you calm her heart, when she notices that her life is different from her peers? What can you do? This show does not answer these questions, it just makes you wonder more about them. The simple story is sweet and heart felt with every event. One can relate to this child as we've all felt the same way when we were children. Will he really be back to pick me up? will i just be abandoned (in this case, again)? What is death? Just like anyone else in the world but a child's especially, trust must be earned and this is made more complicated in a society where it has become customary to trust no one.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is simple again just like the story and fits the feel of the show perfectly. The section before the opening theme in every episode is done in a way that feels as though the line art was handed to a child to fill in the colors with her marker set, giving that section a very strong reminiscent feeling.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, consisting primarily of piano solos sometimes accompanied by strings, kicks in at the perfect times fading in and out seamlessly. They are not grand scores but are beautiful nonetheless. At key moments the director sometimes chooses to have the music go silent, leaving only the key background noises and the voices of the characters, and he uses this to great effect. It can be said the music is as light as a child's emotions, void of the heavy ideals of a grown up, easily carried away by the breeze of the moment.\\n\\n\r\nOver all this is a very sentimental show, and completely character driven. By it's nature it is very VERY slow paced, however it would not have the same effect otherwise and i would not have it any other way. As long as you do not mind a slow paced show i recommend this to anyone who likes emotional ones.",

            "content": "UD is a parenting manual. It is an anime that deals with the issues of raising a kid and how you must pretty much sacrifice everything for it. There are no boobs or giant robots here; this is so much slice of life it is practically bleeding. \r\nStory: \r\n30-year-old bachelor Daikichi decides to adopt his recently deceased grandfather's love child Rin as a way of flipping the bird to his snotty relatives. Domestic bliss ensues. \r\nThe story started off very powerfully and was very cunningly adept at tugging on heartstrings the way it portrayed a neglected but very sweet child building a trusting family relationshipwith an adult who was clueless about parenting but nevertheless grew to be quite good at it. Then, somehow, each succeeding episode focused more on making a point about how wonderful/terrible parenting is rather than telling a story. Much like real life, the plot shows random stuff happening within the span of a year without much cohesion. While this is not a bad thing per se, the story would have benefited from some sort of conflict and climax. A plot, in short, is missing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nDaikichi is a stoic character taking everything in stride with admirable patience. He is a lovely character to watch as he faces the terrors being a parent: from arranging for daycare to discovering a pool of piss on his bed. His spontaneous act of reckless kindness at the beginning slowly forms into a bond of responsibility with his adopted daughter. His interactions with the other characters make him realise things he had never before thought of. Very solid character development.\\n\r\nRin is the adopted daughter. Simply put, she is a fictional character. The only way a kid her age could be as cute, polite and sweet is to shoot it full of Valium. Leaving this detail aside, she also has excellent character development. Little by little she is shown to come out of her shell and finally come to trust her substitute parent completely. \\n\r\nMasako is Rin\u2019s biological mother who dumped her. Refreshingly, Masako is not portrayed like a filthy demon from hell but as a real individual. She made her choice and we see her dealing with the consequences. Still, I expected her part to be slightly more important.\\n\r\nRin\u2019s classmate Kouki & his single mom are pretty much permanent fixtures in Daikichi and Rin\u2019s life. They are a form of mirror to our protagonists, so similar in their single parent family structure yet so very different in character and dynamics. \\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are also very realistic. Slice of life up to 11. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: \\n\r\nExcellent animation. Realistic backgrounds, awesome details, very fluid motion. The studio worked their asses off on this one. Also, as a neat bonus, the first minute or so is done in soft watercolour-y style. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nDiscreet. It underlines the emotional parts and fulfils its function simply and cleanly. \\n\r\nOP & ED: truth be told, they annoyed the hell out of me so I skipped them every single time.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\nThis is tricky. While I've enjoyed this show, its realistic characters and its window into Japan's family ties it ultimately failed to move me. The first three or four episodes were dynamite but then it fizzed out. Too much moral lecturing on the virtue of sacrifice, too little structured plot. I am glad I watched this but I don't feel the need to keep this or watch it again. \\n",

            "content": "Usagi Drop is a breath of fresh air for those who are a bit tired with the excessive amounts of fanservice, dull characters, and even duller plots that seem to plague the medium. For once we can have an anime that touches upon issues in a serious and honest manner, while having just about the right amount of lightheartedness and humor that prevents the series from getting too heavy. The result is a heartwarming, feel good tale that manages to allow viewers to empathize with the characters and perhaps the show as a whole to be adorable without feeling that they are being insulted.\r\nVisually, UsagiDrop is pleasing to the eye, and the watercolor style art creates a pretty distinct effect-- it also looks different.  It's not the most breathtaking artwork out there, but it's consistent and you never get a feeling of blockiness that tends to happen with the cheaper animated works. It also gives off kind of a nostalgic feeling that makes me feel like I'm watching a family oriented children's cartoon, but not in a bad way.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals also go really well with the audio, most notably the opening song Sweet Drops. \"Yay, everything is happy and cute\" is the mood I get from it. Overall, it's very upbeat and optimistic\\n\\n\r\nBut while we have this atmosphere of idealism and happiness, the story itself isn't all just a happy world where nothing can go wrong. Indeed, the very premise is about a child by name of Rin who has no one that wants to take her in, and a lot of her family didn't even know she existed. It's a terrible thing for a child to feel unwanted, yet here we have the relatives playing hot potato with a child. On the other hand, taking care of a child isn't exactly something you can just do, and this is what the story will go on about. Answers aren't easy and clear cut.\\n\\n\r\nEnter Dakachi; a man that is still single and has no idea of how to raise a child. Naturally the folks around him aren't exactly confident, but since he's the only one that will step up to the plate.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime takes us along with Dakachi and Rin, as well as their friends and family on a journey of growth.  Dakachi must learn to raise Rin, and Rin must learn to recognize this man that just took her in. Naturally it's not exactly an easy process, and I really enjoyed how gradual the anime made the process. Never has an experience about the typically boring routine of people's lives been so entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop isn't the most exciting of animes, nor is the plot the most complex, but watching the characters gradually develop into people that are more able to handle the difficulties of life makes this an outstanding watch. It truly does justice to the term \"Slice of Life\".\\n\\n\r\nSo if you need something a bit different, but is also light and relaxing, I wholeheartedly recommend this. Perhaps it'll allow you to see anime in a better light, or even be able to share this with other folks without having them look at you funny.\\n",

            "content": "Script - A guy takes care of a girl. Implications? She gets happier than before. Guy becomes more responsible. New connections are established on a superficial level and by the end what you have is a guide on how to raise children that actually doesn't work. Why? Because the child in question isn't a child, but an adult. A smaller version of it at least. She's so mature it is not even fun to see the protagonist parenting, we know it is not necessary. The only reason why the initial relationship between the two takes place is that she's traumatized due her father's death. Thatleads to a very interesting moment when she's afraid of death and all, but it ends there. So in every episode you have a minor struggle and the bigger one is present in all episodes, that would be both trying to act like a natural family. However, that's already solved in previous episodes and I can't see signs of such struggle, making the plot tiring and boring. I don't care about parenting for the sake of parenting. Put something interesting in between such simplistic events otherwise no way it'll end up being poignant at all. The dialogues are rather normal and full of sameness and tropes like the one where the father says he's not going to do something, the child drops the head in disappointment and right after the father says he's going to do something else for the kid's amusement. How cute, I've seen this just a couple of million times. The only credit I can give this show in terms of maturity is the fact it does not create stupid situations that would never happen in real life.\\n\\n\r\nCinematography - Watercolor amuses me at some points, but suddenly everything goes normal again and there's nothing attractive about characters' look. Camera angles are captivating at times, like in the first episode where they're utilized to construct a non-verbal relationship between the protagonist and the little girl. However, I'll not go as far as saying it impressed me overall, just decent enough and that's it.\\n\\n\r\n\"The opening represents the growth process through plants just like in the actual story\" Obvious, Captain.\\n\\n\r\nSound - I love tracks that keep playing all the time in most slice of life because there wasn't that much of effort being put in their production. The opening and ending are cool. Voices are not forced what is cool, but besides the girl's one that actually conveys some emotion in emotional moments, there's nothing special at all.\\n\\n\r\n1234 - zzzzzzzzz going to kindergarten zzzzzzzz going back from kindergarten zzzzzzzzz poop jokes from the boy who's there for some reason zzzzzzzzz *WAKING UP* did it end? Cute show. What happened again?\\n\\n\r\nGuy takes care of a girl very realistically during almost 4 hours. It's not bad, but not my thing either. I like parenting, but I don't like hearing from other people how they raise their children nor seeing it because it gets boring pretty fast. Usagi Drop could've been great if only had explored themes or created bigger struggles for its characters. I heard from someone that the manga contains Incest, now that seems exciting.",

            "content": "Beautiful...a word often used in the realms of the arts, except of course in anime. Anime is often comical, action packed, suspenseful, mysterious, heart-warming...but it is rare when one can truly describe an anime as being beautiful.\r\nUsagi Drop is that anime. A show that, from the very beginning, knows exactly what it is, and is completely unapologetic about it. It's the video game without any combat, the movie without the almost naked woman, the novel where the main character is not the most important. Usagi drop breaks down all boundaries by attempting to break none. Tension, real tension, over tiny bumps in the road, andsubstantive emotional feedback in the most mundane circumstances is what makes Usagi Drop stand tall above all other slice of life anime, and most others for that matter.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\r\nSimplicity is the name of the game. Written out, the plot of Usagi drop would be an advanced kindergarten book, but that doesn't matter. No ridiculous plot twists, just an anime which attempts to shine a light on the inherit beauty of kindness, children, and life. But that is not to say the anime is too slow, rather it is paced perfectly throughout the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nNothing to say here. The art style was different, but it fit well with the theme of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nThe sound track, like the story is simple. The voices and acting is well executed and directed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10\\n\r\nI will only address the two main characters here. Daikichi is written excellently, he is nonchalant about most everything, but is easily freaked out by new things that Rin does or new experiences with Rin. Like a real person, he isn't some hell spawn constantly begging for the audience to feel for him, he's just a guy living an almost normal life.\\n\\n\r\nRin is written like a child, and while it's strange to say, her, as a normal child, is incredibly refreshing. She isn't a target for emotional outpouring, she's just a child who behaves like a child. She's the weird combination of shy and outgoing that children tend to be.\\n\\n\r\nLike the story, the characters are written without anything particularly impressive, if you don't count behaving like humans without seeming impossibly cool or outrageously clueless impressive in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nUsagi Drop is just a good watch, and it is very easy to watch....I gave it a 10, so I obviously enjoyed everything...",

            "content": "Slice of life is generally a tricky genre to get right. When I say slice of life, I don't mean those dime-a-dozen high school comedies the industry has become oversaturated with as of late. Rather, I refer to series that find something meaningful to explore through the small conflicts of commonplace events. All too often, attempts at this genre come off as either excessive and unnatural or dull and listless. It stands to reason, then, that the best shows of this kind are the ones that introduce unfamiliar elements that make these characters' lives distinct from our own, while still staying in touch with thelittle aspects of ordinary life that make people who they are. Bunny Drop is one such work, and it executes this beautifully. It's a small, unambitious story about ordinary people but it carries itself with a certain measure of refined dignity that's rarely seen in anime in general, let alone the slice of life genre. It has genuine insight into parenthood, but it never talks down to its audience and you don't have to be a parent to get behind the story. This is quite honestly one of the most accessible anime I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nThe staff of Production IG handled this show with the sort of nurturing care rarely seen in a slice of life anime, which usually tend to get the short end of the stick production-wise. Backgrounds are surprisingly detailed, colors are warm and rich, and even when the character models go into super-deformed mode (which happens often) movements are fluid and quality control remains excellent. Of particular note are the opening segments of each episode, which are animated in a soft crayon-esque style reminiscent of a children's storybook. That's to say nothing of the charming character designs. Every character is distinctive in an understated way that isn't too far-removed from reality. Family members really do resemble one another (which is especially great since this is a show about family), but not to the point that they could be called carbon copies. The children are cute without defaulting to an overly moe-fied style as Japanese animation is wont to do. This is a spectacular visual effort that sets the tone for the show perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is mostly comprised of low-key string pieces, and can best be described as charming for its gentle, sincere simplicity. It can get a bit repetitive, a good portion of the soundtrack is comprised of several different instrumentations of the same basic piece, but perhaps due to the series' short length it never wears out its welcome. I've seen longer anime get away with worse, so really I have no complaints.\\n\\n\r\nThere's one thing about anime voice acting in Japan that makes it perfectly suited to this kind of show, and that's their willingness to fill their child roles with real children. It does happen in the States occasionally (Aaron Dismuke as Alphonse Elric from Fullmetal Alchemist comes to mind immediately) but it's not nearly as common. Rin, her friend Kouki, her cousin Reina and several minor child characters are all played by age-appropriate voice actors, which makes them sound genuine as only real children can. Ayu Matsuura in particular does a great job as Rin, and I wouldn't be surprised to hear more from her in the years to come as she grows and matures into new roles. The adults sound pretty good too, at least to my ears. The lack of a dub does create a problem for some potential viewers, though, which is unfortunate because otherwise I'm fairly confident I can recommend this series to just about anyone.\\n\\n\r\nBunny Drop is first and foremost an emotional series. It's a pretty consistently upbeat series but it never goes too far into \"flowery sunshine and rainbows\" territory. This show works because of how true it is to the small, understated moments that a parent and child really do share every day. These moments never feel unnecessary because Daikichi is as new to Rin and to parenting as we are (unless, y'know, you're already a parent), so we get to discover these things as he does. Both Daikichi and Rin have time to develop in small, believable ways and build a realistic family relationship. Daikichi is always well-meaning, and you never doubt he's suited to raise Rin, but he does run into a lot of problems that he overcomes with believable difficulty. Rin, meanwhile, is a well-mannered girl who is in some ways wise beyond her years, but she still faces common everyday problems for a child her age like wetting the bed, and she confronts these problems as any child would, so even when she acts a bit old for her age you never forget she's six. The two of them complement each other sweetly but never come across as saccharine--no small feat. They're not particularly complex characters, but they're still charming and memorable, and feel like real people rather than archetypes.\\n\\n\r\nActually, \"charming\", \"memorable\" and \"real\" are good ways to describe the entire cast. From Daikichi's family to Rin's playmates, they all act remarkably true to the people we could really meet at these various stages in our lives. The show uses its surprisingly large cast to its full advantage, with every character acting as a foil to Daikichi and Rin in some way or another. For example, there's Daikichi's mother Sachiko, who's already been through everything Daikichi is going through right now, and his sister Kazumi, who's on the cusp of starting a family of her own. Both of them initially question Daikichi's decision, but after warming up to Rin and reflecting on their own lives we do see them change for the better in little ways. The lessons are simple but important ones, and they come across naturally through everyday interactions rather than being crammed down our throats.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one character in this series who deserves special mention, though, it's Masako, the mother who abandoned Rin with her father. When Daikichi meets her, she's nothing like he expects her to be, and it turns out her reasons for leaving Rin are more complex than pure apathy. She's focused on her own career and not at all suited to being a mother, but despite her efforts to distance herself she can't help but care about Rin in her own way. She doesn't feel that she was ready to be a mother, and maybe she's right, but that doesn't make her a bad person. That the show managed to portray her in such a light is probably its greatest achievement, and the closest the series comes to delving into the dark side of parenthood. Her character arc is so good, in fact, that it casts the show's greatest flaw into sharp relief.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, Bunny Drop falls into a bit of a comfort zone, in that it's severely limited in its thematic and emotional spectrum. Not that it doesn't bring anything meaningful to the table, but the picture it paints of parenthood is a little too rosy to encompass the full experience. Daikichi never really messes up, the little mistakes he make and the details that slip through the cracks are quickly forgiven and forgotten, and many of the difficulties he and Rin might have to face are discussed but never actually portrayed, such as the possibility that Rin might be teased for her family circumstances. Am I being too cynical? Perhaps, but it's arcs like Masako's that prove that the show can strive for something more without sacrificing its purity and sincerity; Masako wasn't in the right, exactly, but what she did was still understandable, sympathetic even, and it shed light on some truths about parenthood that are rarely addressed. The show needed more material like that, but aside from that one arc and a pretty powerful opening episode (the scene where Daikichi takes Rin home is actually a great moment), Bunny Drop systematically dodged every opportunity to become something more. I mentioned Daikichi's mother earlier, and on a whole I didn't dislike her character, but one thing that bothered me was that even after she warmed up to Rin she never apologized for treating her so coldly early on. That's something the show would have been better for confronting rather than tiptoeing around it the way it did, and this series does quite a lot of tiptoeing in its short run.\\n\\n\r\nWhat we're left with is a rather baffling creation. Bunny Drop is primarily a feel-good anime, but I can't write it off as meaningless fluff. It does have some genuine depth and weight to it, and it's true to life in its portrayal of the joys of family, but a limited scope does take its toll on the series. The final episode is just like every other episode: nothing particularly powerful, conclusive or poignant, life just goes on. Perhaps that's for the best, as I've had the ending to the source manga spoiled for me and it does not sound like a good direction to take the story, but even if the inconclusive ending we got was preferable that certainly doesn't make it good. Not that it's bad, mind you, it's certainly better than seeing it try for something conclusive only to fall flat on its face. Still, the series as a whole never really strives for greatness, and that's too bad. To be fair, maybe too much weightiness would have damaged the series' charming tone, so I can't fault it too much. Some anime just aren't meant to be great, and for what it is Bunny Drop is still undeniably good.\\n\\n\r\nBunny Drop is a gentle, extremely lovable look at parenting and family. It's not a grand or complex or particularly thought-provoking story, nor is it the peak of what slice of life anime can achieve, but it is sincere from start to finish, with hardly single beat that rings false in the entire show. Lack of a dub notwithstanding I think this is something even non-anime fans can enjoy. I recommend it wholeheartedly. Watch it, enjoy it, maybe you'll get more out of it than I did.",

            "content": "Children are no easy task to take care of. They require a lot of attention and patience to deal with. As a child, I was reckless and very stubborn. I'm glad my parents dealt with me and loved me for who I am. Though when a family member dies, a person can change in a way to make them more secluded and feeling alone, but when someone reaches out to you with love and care, they can change back.\r\nThe story follows a girl named Rin and she was an unknown child belonging to an old man named Souichi and when he dies, she's left alone.No one wanting to take her into their care knowing the problems a child may cause,  she's left there not knowing what to do. Angry at their reactions Daikichi, a middle aged man, takes Rin into his care with open arms.\\n\\n\r\nAfter the whole affair and Rin starts to live with him, the anime follows their daily lives and the bond that the two start to grow for each other. Over time they begin to have a real father-daughter bond and both love each other greatly. Showing a realistic approach to how children act in this anime, it's something everyone can relate to and genuine enjoy to watch a family grow and love each other.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters being a key role in any slice of life, this has one of the best character development and realism in each of them. They all have a realistic personality that anyone can relate to such as panicking when their child is ill for the first time, meeting new parents and wishing your kid to have a good day.\\n\\n\r\nYou're introduced to Rin, a girl who is quiet and shy towards the rest of the family at the start of the anime. Through the bonding with Daikichi and her new parent, she gets to be introduced to each family member along the way and truly starts to love each and one of them as real significant people in her life. She's a normal girl with trust issues at first and problems that every child goes through, such as wetting the bed. She's mature for her age, but still childish in many points. \\n\\n\r\nNext we have Daikichi, he's a middle aged man who has no experience with children, but takes Rin into his home with open arms and learns as the time goes on. With the role of being a parent, he learns a lot about taking care of children and the habits of being one. He soon starts to focus on Rin and asks for a job position change so he can get off work earlier just to pick her up.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is something that really compliments the mood of the anime in a way that gives it a childish feeling, but also giving off a warm feeling through the entire anime. The scenery was always nice to look at and made it really nice with the light color palette that the anime has. All the characters are given really nice detail with their facial structure and nothing is overly emphasized. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening is a really cute song that supports the theme of family. The background music always fit each scene regardless if it was supposed to be a comedic scene or a serious scene. Along side the great characters you have wonderful voice actors to give them life and bring more to the table to offer. With Rin they used an actual kid as a voice actor which gave the anime a whole better sound to it rather than the usual adult voice actor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is an anime that is very realistic to which anyone can relate to. The concept of family and learning parent hood is something that is often overlooked and rushed with people today. The character development is very true to their personality and lets them shine from start to end to make a heartfelt anime that any true slice of life fan would enjoy. I recommend this to anyone who's looking for something relaxing and adorable to watch!",

            "content": "\u201cGive me more episodes!\u201d\r\nThat was how if felt by the end of the series. There was just something magical about the series and it started to grow on me. I started off appreciating the show but not really enjoying it, but by the last episode I could not help but feel that another season of this series would be something nice to have.\r\nGoing home from his grandfather\u2019s funeral, thirty-year-old Daikichi is floored to discover that the old man had an illegitimate child with a younger lover. The rest of his family is equally shocked and embarrassed by this surprise development, and not one of themwants anything to do with the silent little girl, Rin Kaga. In a fit of anger, Daikichi decides to take her in himself. As Daikichi nurtures Rin, he started to understand the struggle while at the same time the joy of parenting.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are realistic and are characters that you would be able to relate to. As such, you feel a bigger impact of each episode\u2019s situations and you feel like you are part of that family as they go through their times of trouble when adjusting to the life of parenthood.\\n\\n\r\nDaikichi is a salary man who has spent his life as a single 30+ years old male without much thought about the future and thus struggles with life as a parent when it is suddenly thrust upon him. His character is so confused when it comes to most of the things regarding childcare and is essentially just taking things as they come which always makes it a fun to watch when he suddenly realises some of the simple things that are important to a kid.\\n\\n\r\nRin takes on the role as the \u201cmature/wiser\u201d child who still retains her immaturity despite her maturity. She reminds me of kids who have gone through a lot and thus are wiser than the other kids around her age yet her behaviors and knowledge when it comes to things are still that of a kid. I think that is a good thing because that is essentially what her character is meant to be and her complicated past reflects in her behaviour and attitude. If only kids were like that these days. Oh how times have changed.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are also interesting to watch. Each of them have their own unique personality that are once again very nicely executed and easy to relate to.\\n\\n\r\nI love the pastel tones that are used for this show as it really gives that gentle and soft feeling that compliments the style of the show very well. \\n\r\nThe character designs take some getting used to since they are not similar to the generic style which our eyes would be used to but they are also not too drastically different.\\n\\n\r\nThe one slight flaw of the show is the music, and while it is not bad, it is not memorable. It works as a part of the series, but the opening, ending and all the music in between do not stay with you long. That is probably just as well because what should stay with you after watching Usagi Drop is the show, and perhaps the music is an intentional after-thought.\\n\\n\r\nAt eleven episodes, you really don't have an excuse to not watch this series. Usagi Drop will make you cry, it will make you laugh, and it will make you believe that there are beautiful things in this world and help you hope for a better tomorrow for all those who are shoved to the margins by society. I can't give this series a high enough recommendation, but it should suffice to say that you need to watch this show and hope that more studios are willing to break the mold in the future.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a relaxing, gentle family drama series that will leave you with a heartwarming feeling at the end of each episode. To me, \u2018relaxing\u2019 would be the key word to describe this series.\\n\\n\r\nThere is nothing over-the-top when it comes to this show and it is simply just a good and enjoyable series to watch during your off time.\\n\\n\r\nRin, why you such an awesome child?!",

            "content": "Japan has a declining birth rates in the past 10 years, and Otaku(s) is one of the reason. Most of their people refuse to have a child since it will be make their life more complicated. This series was aimed at the ones who always thinks like that, and hoping they will change their mind after watching this series. Usagi Drop showed the world how beautiful your life with a child, explained perfectly how a child can colors your house and living room.\r\nIt doesn\u2019t have supernatural things, it doesn\u2019t have action fighting, it doesn\u2019t have high quality comedies, it doesn\u2019t have over dramatic story, andit also doesn\u2019t have romantic story, yet I still find it brilliant. How? The writer just keep the story simple and interesting consistently. Usagi Drop is a proof that genre is a very subjective view to assess a story quality. The most important thing is to make the story interesting consistenly, always keep it simple and interesting. I believe there\u2019s no bad written script on the story, the writer keeps the conversation and background story as simple as possible, and it made this story is so easy to understand and fun to follow. The relationship between Daikichi and Rin is a relationship that everyone will adore whoever you\u2019re.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop is a rare adult-story anime. Usually, an anime that aimed to the more mature audience is mostly about sex, murder, torture, psychological freak, and other negative vibes. I honestly think Japan should\u2019ve make and adapts this kind of anime more often, I know it probably doesn\u2019t sell very well, but it\u2019s important to teach people more about humanity.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop may be aimed at more mature audience, but I would recommend this to everyone, no matter how old you are. It doesn\u2019t only showed us about how beautiful a family life is, but it also teach us about how to have a better life, and know what to prioritize.",

            "content": "Usagi Drop started out as a manga by Unita Yumi. The anime adaptation was handled by Production I.G. It's also the second Josei series I've been asked to review. The other being Nodame Cantabile. Let's take a look at Usagi Drop and see how it compares.\r\nThe story follows a man named Daikichi who goes to his grandfather's funeral only to discover that his grandfather had an illegitimate child named Rin. His family treats her like a nuisance, which angers him so he makes a snap decision to take custody of her. You know, like all of those other stories where someone without kids is somehowforced into looking after one. The anime follows the two in their daily lives as they grow closer and as Daikichi uncovers information about Rin's past. There's really not much in terms of an actual story. The biggest negative is just that the series is largely boring. A bunch of ordinary events like a kindergarten graduation or visiting family may be a natural part of life, but they don't make for an interesting or compelling narrative. Not unless there are some really spectacular characters behind them, but I'll get to that in a bit. The most tension you get is that Rin comes down with the flu for all of an episode. The series tries to maintain a humorous tone most of the time, but most of the jokes aren't really funny. They're just like those stories that  some parents tell about their kid doing something kind of stupid that the parent finds hilarious but no one else actually cares about because it's not really funny but you feel compelled to fake a laugh to be polite. To give the series some credit, there are some cute moments and Daikichi's search for Rin's mother is kind of interesting. It also avoids the cheesy romance plot that usually comes with \"single person is compelled to look after a kid and discovers the 'joys' of parenthood\" stories.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the characters. The kids in this act like actual children which translates to them being pretty obnoxious most of the time. The only real exception is Rin, who's, thankfully, the one we spend the most time with. She can be annoying at times, but most of the time she's mature in enough ways to be tolerable. Most of the adult characters are just kind of boring. They spend a lot of their time focusing on their kids, which kind of reminds me of some people I've known who were interesting before they had kids but won't shut up about their kids now that they've had them and aren't interesting anymore. Now, before you send me a bunch of angry messages, I'm not saying all parents are like that. I'm specifically talking about parents who don't have interests outside of being parents or don't seem to since all they ever talk about is their children. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this is kind of sketchy. The opening scenes for every episode have this kind of chalky unfinished look and then it transitions into a more complete look. Initially I thought that they'd just run out of time and hadn't been able to completely finish, but after a few episodes it became clear that it was just a very odd stylistic decision. They also have some very strange moments where the character's faces convert to a very minimalistic style which I think is done as an attempt at humour, but I'm not sure since it can be hard to discern what's supposed to be funny and what's just whimsical. The backgrounds tend to be pretty plain. Most of the time the characters and various objects do look pretty nice though. The flora especially. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast in this is decent enough. Although not really anything special. the music is kind enough to play an effect most of the time something funny is supposed to have happened. Which is kind of weird. Did they just know the material wasn't going to actually be funny and having a character hold a sign saying \"laugh\" would've been too obvious? The music is pretty fitting for the series. It's slow and soft. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 1/10. Most of the focus is on six year olds so it makes sense that there's not yuri in this. \\n\\n\r\nSo, that's Usagi Drop. Honestly, I'm not in the demographic for this since my general reaction to children can best be summed up as \"meh.\" It's a mostly light-hearted and very dull series. There's nothing egregiously wrong with it, but you probably aren't going to be entertained by it unless you really like children. For myself, I give it a 5/10. Meh.",

            "content": "I fell in love with a 6-year old. Please don't call the cops.\r\nStory:\r\nA 30 years old man \"adopts\" a six year old girl out of pity and has to live with the consequences of suddenly becoming a \"father\". That is technically all there is to it, but it is more than enough to work with. After all, the life of a child is full of events, a lot is changing and on top of that, we have 2 characters who have their lives turned upside down from one day to the next. All this is shown through Daikichis eyes, which is the perspective I canrelate to a lot more. It also makes Usagi Drop as sweet as a candy cane. This is slice of life done right, a little bit of drama here and there but ultimately a ride of fuzzy feelings and smiles. The only downside is that it's way to short with only 11 episodes.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nDespite being focussed on a cute little girl, the anime does not fall into \"moe territory\". It is cute and simplistic, but nowhere near the point where you could get the feeling it is forced. Being a story about children, Usagi Drop is bright and colorful, which fits this show very well. I also liked to see some normal looking adults for a change, you rarely have that in anime either.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening theme is kinda childish, fitting the anime well (fitting seems to be the major word of this review) and it is pretty catchy. Yet, it is not that great in my eyes, but as I mentioned in other reviews, this may just be a case of me having a very different taste in music. Pretty much the same goes for the ending. Something Usagi Drop really shines in though is the voices. Rin is voiced by an actual child, making her sound very convincing, but the others aren't bad either. Soundtrack is spare but never distracting.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe main selling point of this anime. Rin is the most adorable child you will ever see (spoiler: your child will not be this well-behaved) and it is pure joy seeing her grow from the shy little thing in episode one to the happy, normal kid in episode 11. Daikichi does a really good job being a father for her. His initial decision was pretty crazy from a realistic point of view, but he knows this as well and keeps improving to make Rins world a better place. The rest of the cast was okay, none of them stood out as special, but I guess that was not the point of Usagi Drop anyway.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI have a working day of about 8\u00bd hours plus 1\u00bd-2 hours of driving. When I get home, I just wanna relax and have some fun. When I tuned into my daily dose of Rin, I felt at peace. It made me think that life is good. To watch a child grow up can really be all the joy you'll ever need and I think I can finally understand parents who give up everything for this one little thing.\\n\r\nOkay, that was very cheesy, I apologise.\\n\r\nUsagi Drop will give you a good feeling, wether you like children or not. As long as you don't mind the slice of life genre, you should definitely take a look at this.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n9.0/10",

Now here me out now, I only write reviews when I have a new take on a thing; this is a heartworming story about a very lonely man who is very clever, and it is a great social insite! Let me tell you about this awww-dorable show that captured my heart, get it!? \r\nThe story is about a very lonely loser, Daikatchi, who ends up buckling down and taking responsibility to adopt a cute, little perfect blonde girl that no onewanted even though everyone wants one in the real life. Since he's lived alone, like most of us, in a miserable stupor doing irresponsable things for so long, it's a joy to watch him transform with the girl into a respectible adult! That's what the show wants you to think, though...!\\n\\n\r\nActually, the journey of the show is watching the main character condition and train the girl to be his girlfriend so they can have their inevitable romatic relationship! It's simplicity genius at work; he even cuts her hair the way he wants it! As time goes on this becomes more and more clear that our Daicatchy is on a mission, waiting for the years to go by until he has his very own 20-years younger girlfriend. See, it's an educational show, too, for teaching lonely otaku how to grow your own wife!\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is all pastels, baby colors for the unedukated, which makes sense since there's a very warm presence to the show as it's a love story. Colors are everywhere, and the art is drawn all sketchy like a child's drawing. Cute and expressove, The characters are all bright-eyed aside from Daicatchy, which in traditional japanese villain fashion has beady pupils, signifying he's not just a nice father, he's a love-starved maniac waiting for the fruit to ripen like a good, patient, timid, old-fashioned, otaku! \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is good, but the sound track really doesn't exist. I didn't hear anything. I don't even remember if there was music, which is probably this show's biggest flaw if it has one at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall if you like romance, evil geniuses, educational and pratickle ideas for your own loveless life, or just plain cute stories about a being a good parent, you'll love this show. It's not usually my thing, either, but with all the subtest I really got into it! I hope there's a sequel where we get to see a relationship and maybe a breakup since evil doesn't pay off.\\n\\n",

            "content": "As a kid, I often searched for inspirations through celebrity pop stars, acclaimed sportsmen, and even fictional characters wearing underpants outside of their trousers. Whilst all that time, the tall figure holding my right hand was, and still is, the biggest hero of my life.\r\nKanta Kamei gained lots of fans in 2011. Prior to that, he was involved in some other works, too, but this was his biggest and most successful role. As the director of Usagi Drop, he boosted confidence in 16 and 17 year olds into thinking doing \u201cit\u201d without protection might not be that bad.\r\nDaikichi attended his grandfather\u2019s funeral and brought backwith him his 6 year-old aunt, Rin. Detested by his relatives for disowning her, Daikichi couldn\u2019t forgo his sense of duty and adopted Rin on impulse. This might make Daikichi sounds irresponsible, he isn\u2019t. Our protagonist quickly became aware of the needs to change his lifestyle and adapt. He accepts this wholeheartedly. You will see how the rapport between the duet flourishes into a father-daughter affinity.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Rin and Daikichi grew episode per episode. From what was an escape route becomes much more to Rin, her trust to Daikichi becomes that of a pure and innocent dependency. Throughout the 11 episodes, every little aspect, from planting Rin\u2019s birth tree to doing Rin\u2019s hair, add to strengthen their sense of comfort around each other. Without a mother in the house, Rin, somewhat, takes on the role and tries her best to fill the shoes. As mature as Rin might appear, she is and does act like a 6 year-old. Rin\u2019s eyebrows curl when she\u2019s irritated and her eyes portray a genuine surprise and excitement when she catches a glimpse of something new. You will see, but might not notice until it has happened for an extended amount of time, how Rin shifts from the sluggish girl who lost hope of being loved, to the spirited, big sister that is top of her class. Even Daikichi\u2019s mother, who wanted to feed Rin to the wolves, begins to take a liking to Rin and labels herself as Rin\u2019s grandma. This is, actually, a realistic character development.\\n\\n\r\nAt times, Daikichi\u2019s clumsiness will make you laugh at him and his abashment behaviour would make you pity him. But it\u2019s the times when he shows his sense of duty, which would enact you to look up to him, carving a much stronger image of his character.\\n\\n\r\nThe support cast carry weights as well. Daikichi\u2019s two sisters provide insights from different angles into marriage, the conflicts that Usagi Drop didn\u2019t make Daikichi and Rin go through, you can catch a sniff of from the supporting characters. After becoming a parent himself, Daikichi meets new people he would not have had otherwise. For example, Yujiari Nitani (voiced by the same seiyuu that voiced Lelouch from Code Geass\u2026) gives this series an additional dimension; romance between Yukari and Daikichi is subtle but distinct. More significantly, Yukari can be seen as a mentor, for she is a more experienced and dependable single parent. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation is well done, Daikichi moves like a giant when he walks whilst Rin skips next to him like a child would. Art is generally, crayon and childish looking, but by no means under-detailed. The manga has lots of frames for simple and short passages and its drawings are extremely clear, but the manga didn\u2019t hint how an anime adaptation should look. This left Production I.G to make that decision themselves; the colour pallet they chose is very fitting of what the series projects and I am happy with their interpretation.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuu for Rin did excellently for her infantile role. In fact, Rin is voiced by Matsuura Ayu, a 10 year-old girl, who later voiced for a supporting role in Eureka Seven AO.  Daikichi was voiced by Tsuchida Hiroshi, whose other roles were of mostly in shounen series, from evil scientist to Wolverine. It is nice to see Hiroshi attempting such a caring and mature role with a softer voice and doses of slapstick humour. Soundtracks are gentle, the opening and ending theme songs are very nursery.\\n\\n\r\nHeart-warming and comical moments help balance the serious topic of \u201chow much one is willing to sacrifice for another\u2019s child?\u201d The comic-relief present here would not work in all series, it works here because Rin is just so cute. The V-shaped grin and button eyes are adorable; I too, would quit drinking and smoking for her sake and centre her as my priority. Never do I want to see those soulless eyes on her face again. The pace is slightly slow because nothing really dramatic happens in the series, but its charm accumulates through their daily activities and interaction with society.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop does a good job in making you think raising a child can be a very rewarding tenure, an extra pair of hands around the house, cook the breakfast and water the garden. But what it pulls off even better is aspiring how being a parent, beyond its sacrifices and uncertainties, is the sudden realisation and transformation into a knight-in-shiny-armour to an innocent and na\u00efve little sprout that would bloom into whatever form, shaped by the guardian\u2019s influence. The growth of this intertwining and indivisible bond is to be forever cherished. Usagi Drop allowed me to discover all this alongside Kawachi Daikichi.\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Thanks to Vis4Vanity for recommending this series.)\\n",

            "content": "\"Usagi Drop\" is perhaps the most perfect example of Slice of Life anime there is, it does the genre justice. For a short moment at least it makes you forget the complexity of life by promoting the simple aspects of life from a rather artistic point of view. If passing away some time in absolute relaxation is your motive then this is, without a doubt, just what you're looking for.\r\nWhen thinking about relationships, it feels kind of uneasy to think too far ahead, or at least to the point where you have to think about having kids. Sometimes too much time passes by without usrealizing that we may have missed a bus. This anime is like a window to a life such as that.\\n\r\nDaikichi Kawachi is a single man in his early 30s. Circumstances made him decide to adopt a little girl named Rin. And the girl just happens to be his late grandfather's illegitimate child.\\n\r\nThe life a person new to parenthood and a self independent child goes on at a lovely pace. Little things get them all worked-up, little moments bring smile. I don't think there's another anime that will take you so close to the emotions of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nFor such a classic slice of life anime I'll say it deserves a 9.6",

            "content": "Do you like the slice-of-life genre? Do you like a story that is realistic in virtually every way? Do you want to feel all warm and fuzzy after every episode? If so, then Usagi Drop is the anime for you! Continue reading and you'll see why. \r\nArt (8/10)\r\nTo be honest, the art threw me off quite a bit for the first few episodes. It was unique, but didn't really appeal to me. Although as the series went on, I got used to it and felt that it nicely complimented the feel of the series. To me, the artwork, especially the parts before the OP, ismore soft and relaxing than most of the artwork in other anime these days. This style effectively sets the mood for the series, making it a great addition to one's viewing experience. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\r\nExcellent character development. That phrase can easily sum up my thoughts on this category. Despite the main protagonists Kawachi Daikichi and Kaga Rin being on the receiving end of most of the show's the development, it is great to see some of the supporting characters getting their fair share of development, too. But since the two mentioned above are the main characters of the series, I'll focus more on them in this category. When you first see Daikichi, it is easy to write him off as a lazy and uncaring 30-year-old man who is living a regular, boring life. But during the one year after Rin enters his life, you can see that he is actually a hard-working and caring individual. Alongside Rin, the two go through their new lives together; through both times of hardship and times of joy. Despite the story only being a year-long, it is evident that the two undergo massive transformations. Looking back and seeing them grow and mature together was heartwarming. These days, it's hard to find anime of this genre that are able to develop characters so well in such a sort amount of time. Luckily, Usagi Drop was able to to just that. \\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nArguably the weakest category of the series, but still quite decent. The OP and ED are considered upbeat in my opinion - more so the OP than the ED. In the end, they, along with the BGM, didn't leave a lasting impression on me as they quickly faded from my memory. The highlight of this category was definitely the voice acting. Though there weren't many big name seiy\u016bs in the cast, the presence of 10-year-old Matsuura Ayu was a lovely surprise. This was the first time that I had watched an anime with a child voicing a character, let alone the main character. Nonetheless, I felt that she did a great job considering her age and that the producers decided well in choosing her to voice Rin. \\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10)\\n\r\nFirst off, let me say I haven't read the manga. After watching all 11 episodes, I've heard that some things in the anime version didn't match with the manga version. Nonetheless, I will base my review solely on the anime version. The story, despite it being only one year long, was really good. It didn't feel rushed nor was anything exaggerated/unrealistic. In fact, I think this has been the most realistic anime of this genre that I have ever watched - fully worthy of being slice-of-life. The story is enjoyable and heartwarming, never ceasing to entertain me or helping me to unwind after a long day. The fact that this is all done in only 11 episodes adds to its list of positive aspects. Overall, it's a lovely story that has the potential to appeal to the general audience. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10)\\n\r\nEasily one of the better anime of the Summer 2011 season, and arguably the best one out of those in the slice-of-life genre. Considering the fact that there's still material from the manga not animated, a second season is still not out of the question. The question now is if people are willing to wait for an indefinite amount of time or will they give in to the temptation to see what happens next and read the manga. Aside from that, I wholly recommend Usagi Drop to anyone looking for a laid-back and heartwarming story. None of the action, violence or gore that you find in other genres; just a lovely story about a single man learning to raise a child. Keep your heart and mind open when watching it and I am confident that you will be able to enjoy it just like I did.",

            "content": "This show is simply amazing. Honestly I don't think I've really enjoyed a slice of life like this in a long time. It's a simple story about a 30 year old man suddenly becoming the guardian of a 6 year old girl under some weird circumstances. His life gets turned upside down and things he never really had to think about are suddenly very important. I don't think any show has captured early parenthood like this show. \r\nStory: 9\r\nThe best analogy I can use for this show is like eating a bag of Warheads. It starts off sour (sad, depressing), but then you get tothe sweet center, and everything becomes very lighthearted. Then you eat another, and the cycle continues. It's a very well written and well paced show. With only 11 episodes you wouldn't think they would cover so much, but with the well placed time skips it honestly works really well. I guess the one thing I can complain about is that it ends kinda abruptly. I kinda want to know what happens with Kukei's mom and Daikichi and Rin's mom, too. It's one of those GO READ THE MANGA HURRDURR type endings. Whether or not it was budget cuts or simply not being given an opportunity for more episodes, it still kinda sucks. Kinda like Noragami. Or Blood Lad. Or Zombie Loan. You know, this actually happens a lot.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nNow THIS is where this show excels. It has this pastel color pallet that's kinda childish and soft, which really fits the tone of the show. The animation is great for what it is and I never looked at the show and said, \"Well I know where they cut their budget!\" Like some shows *COUGH COUGH BOKURA GA ITA COUGH COUGH*\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nI mean, there was this ONE instance where the audio for Daikichi's voice clipped because the actor screamed too loud into their mic, but other than that this show's sound is pretty nice. The music isn't too memorable but it fits the scenes ell enough. The opening song seriously reminded me of My Neighbor Totoro, honestly this entire show makes me want to go rewatch My Neighbor Totoro for the, like, millionth time. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nDaikichi is literally the embodiment of a 30 year old Japanese man, at least from everything I've read. He has a demanding job that keeps him at work late, goes out drinking with his coworkers, lives alone, no girlfriend or any intent to start a family. Having Rin enter his life literally changes everything and it's very interesting to follow along his slow decent into parenthood. The ONLY complaint I have for ANY character in this show is Rin, because at times she doesn't seem like a 6 year old. This is kinda a common occurrence in most anime/manga/and media in general so I can't really complain. I guess you can say she's mature because of everything that she's gone through but idk man. I could swear she was 10 sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI had so much fun watching this show. I can't explain it, it's just so cute yet so heartbreaking I feel like I can go on and on about how wonderful this show is. I feel like everyone should watch this. Not just because it's so good but also to maybe appreciate your parents just a little bit more. I mean, this show tends to strain the sacrifices that parents make to raise their children, and it doesn't do it in such a way where it makes you feel like shit. Rather you feel more thoughtful than anything. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nIt certainly isn't perfect, but it comes damn close. This show is really fantastic, and short enough to finish on a slow boring day. If you haven't seen it, go watch it. Seriously, right now, it's on Crunchy Roll. Sit back, relax, and enjoy this simple little story about a 30 year old man taking care of his 6 year old Aunt.",

            "content": "Usagi Drop is a cute and charming anime that tugs at your heart strings and makes you want to grab it and pinch its cheeks. This anime is very different from what I, or maybe you too, may be used to. There's no heart pounding action, no violence, no giant robots, no panty shots, and no swords and sorcery. But its still just as good and just as entertaining.\r\n[Story]\r\nThe anime is very short, only 11 episodes.This is a perfect number of episodes for this specific anime. Since its not dragged out, each episode manages to be well paced and interesting. The story is character driven,focusing solely on the relationships between the characters. Each of these characters manages to be interesting and contribute some sort of wisdom or wit to the story. As the story progresses, we see the kids as well as the adults of the show (specifically Daikichi and in a way Masako) mature and/or change. The anime shows Daikichi going from your average salaryman with no wife or kids who only thought about himself and his needs, to a loving and caring parent towards Rin. Each episode gives you a little bit to chew on and think about. The topics of marriage and parenting frequently come up. If you're young like me, this anime really makes you think more about the challenges of parenthood, and what you're parents went through just to raise you. If you're a parent, you'll probably sympathize and understand Daikichi's troubles. Regardless, there is a little something for everyone. 9/10\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]\\n\\n\r\nThis anime's cast of characters really shine. They're realistic and you can relate to them. Again, the story is largely character driven, so it really helps that each character is so interesting. And most get at least some sort of character development. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll refrain from specific details and examples. All I'll really say is, Daikichi is an entirely different person at the end of the anime. Its amazing how only a year with Rin changed him so much. You may also dislike Masako at first, but later feel sorry for her due to how she chooses to deal with her thoughts of Rin later in the anime. I did not find a single character that I disliked in this anime. 10/10.\\n\\n\r\n[ Art and Sound ]\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is very...different. Its not bad though. It has a nice, colorful, and soft hand drawn look to it. The character designs are very simplistic, no odd hair colors or big hair. To me, this, coupled with their great personalities, makes the characters more realistic. The soundtrack is decent. It consists of soft and mellow songs along with a few more upbeat ones to match the tone of the anime. 9/10\\n\\n\r\n[ Enjoyment ] \\n\\n\r\nI found this anime very enjoyable. Its very cute and I didn't become bored during a single episode. This is coming from someone who usually avoids most slice of life anime, because I find them uninteresting. Not in this case. 9/10\\n\\n\r\n[ Overall ]\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime is great. I'd highly recommend it. Its short and sweet, easy to get in to, and even provokes some thought in the viewer. That doesn't always happen when you watch an anime.  9/10\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Some of the best stories have always been about the most simple things in life, and in this respect Usagi Drop manages to excel greatly. \r\nThe story of Usagi Drop revolves around the 30-year-old Daikichi who decides at the funeral of his grandfather to adopt an unwanted and illegitimate 7-year-old child, Rin. The very premise of this story lends itself to quite the heart warming tale, but the story is at the same time undoubtedly mature. In a nutshell, Usagi Drop is a story about parenting, and the societal worries and responsibilities that come with parenting, and in this case, adopting a child. As itso happens, Daikichi's act of kindness would lead to a complete restructuring of his day to day life.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the most enjoyable aspects of Usagi Drop are its explorations of some of the simple responsibilities being a parent entails. Things like feeding your child, taking your child to school and trying to pick her up at a reasonable time, shopping for school supplies, shopping for groceries, and much more. These are all simple activities and tasks for most people that we take for granted, but become all the more complicated with additional layers of consideration when raising a child. Usagi Drop manages to bring up issues like these and more generally in a a very interesting manner.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, Usagi Drop never becomes heavy handed in its approach. It does not show the process to be without reward, nor does it overly idealize parenting. It tries to present the topic realistically, and does not try to ham fist any sort of hidden agenda. Rin is very cute and/or moe, but the anime never tries to overly exploit her in a way that many more otaku shows would. It is just a very genuine story, that really feels like it came from the heart of the creator. All the meanwhile, it manages to blend enough fun and comedic moments to make this a very entertaining experience, but again in a mature manner.\\n\\n\r\nLike the story itself, Usagi Drop just has such genuine characters. The interactions of the characters are never expressively overly dramatized, and they just seem to feel very natural. Daikichi and Rin in particular have a very enjoyable relationship that really resembles that of a father and daughter. Generally empathy is felt for Rin and Daikichi throughout this story both because Rin is such a great young girl in an unfortunate circumstance, and Daikichi is an incredibly admirably human being for taking on child rearing head on.\\n\\n\r\nFor the production side of things, Usagi Drop excels at visuals while it's audio merely sufficed. The audio was not bad certainly, but nothing really worth remembering on that front other than perhaps the OP, which really manages to brighten your mood upon entering each episode of the show. The visuals deserve praise though. The water color effects reminiscent of another Notamina block show, Wandering Son, are very pleasing and they generally compliment the tone of the show very well. Usagi Drop's style is something I would love to see in more shows.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop manages to cement itself as one of the best slice of life shows around. It manages to transcend anime in the fact that I think the story is one that can be enjoyed by both anime and non-anime viewers alike. The story is very heart warming and provides many uplifting emotions throughout its run. It is a show I would recommend to almost anyone, and it is definitely deserving of much accolades.",

His story is more than extraordinary. Just imagine his grandfather on the ninth decade of life got himself a young mistress and not just started, but also managed to cook up a daughter. The point is certainly not tricky,but at that age is worthy of respect. But my mother was a child in the shower, and when my grandfather went to the light quickly retreated in the hope that someone else will take care of the little daughter. And all of this information falls like a snowball on Daikichi's grandfather's funeral. Of course he was not alone. Gathered all the relatives to decide who care for a child, but fell otmazy river - who have children who work, who have some business. \\n\r\nBut then begins a new round of stories - Daikichi mysteriously like his grandfather, and it is only natural that a little abandoned Rin finds in it something familiar and dear. So begins this story about the life of two people - Daikichi and Rin. Story about the fact that hard to raise a child, it is difficult, time-consuming, anxiety, etc., but it's nothing compared with the love child, who returns from a child to its parent. The story about the fact that not only adults are raising their children, but the children are very much to teach us. \\n\r\nOn your life path Daikichi meets the same parents as he learns a lot of new. His life ceases to be ordinary - and it's great. Rin also matures before our eyes - from the cute first graders to the beautiful high school student who knows himself and his feelings for the young people. But the most important thing that instantly fervent love Daikichi and Rin goes off at the first difficulties, but on the contrary will be strengthened day by day. \\n\r\nIn the manga, the characters reveal much more, as is usually the case. And the story itself has a continuation (in the anime it ends at the elementary school). We will be able to get acquainted with adult Rin and her childhood friend Coke - pretty mischievous and restless. They get older and begin to realize that they are attracted to each other, but as is often the case - girls-modest, and the boys do not think about their actions. \\n\r\nIf we talk about the depiction of, here again, the creators have tried, there was no drawing or fanciful details. All anime (and manga) made \u200b\u200bas if in watercolor sketches, but in this and have their own charm. We can think through everything that we want, when viewing sensations arise levitation on so much light and airy done. But for all its simplicity, each time touching the soul, impossible not to fall in love with the characters and their lives. \\n\r\nI advise you to look at and read everything! everyone can find something of themselves in this anime, each will open something new for myself. \\n\r\nAfter viewing guarantee positive sea with a drop of sadness, a smile from ear to ear. \\n\r\nAdults, but children stay :)\\n\\n\r\nP.S. sorry, original text in russian was google translated because of amateur knowledge of english.

There is no such thing as an anime that will be considered perfect for everyone, and to this day I have only found a handful that are perfect even in my eyes.\r\nUsagi Drop is one of them.\r\nWhile the bare-bones of the story is nothing new, the execution of it was flawless.  The growth between Daikichi and Rin is not rushed and you feel as if you are getting the full picture as you watch them struggle to adapt.  No scene is pointless asevery little moment that they spend together, and apart, strengthens their bond.  Never have I seen a story so well paced as this.  I was not bored for a second.\\n\\n\r\nDaikichi and Rin's world is brought to life through wonderful use of color and atmosphere.  In particular I love that the art style seems almost water colored before the opening credits roll, a little touch that added a lot of enjoyment in my eyes.  No corners are cut when it comes to animation, and each scene is full of little details for you to find one your second or third watch of this series.\\n\\n\r\nWhile music is important for almost all anime, Usagi Drop uses it to full effect.  The over all emotion of a scene is perfectly matched with an elegant piece of music, putting full force behind whatever is happening on screen.  The music, matched with the incredible talent of the voice actors, left a impression on my soul.  So much so that I went and bought the sound track as soon as I was done with the series.\\n\\n\r\nSlice of life anime are character driven, so without strong characters everything falls apart.  Every single character was believable, everything from Daikichi's family's reaction to him taking Rin,  down to how the characters grew as the show went on.  When the show introduces a new character, even if they are only in once episode, the have a purpose.  Their interactions are meaningful, and a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nHeartwarming.  If I were to be asked to sum this anime up into one word, heartwarming would have to be it.  As I said before, masterpiece is a subjective word.  Everyone will have their own idea one what a masterpiece should and should not be.  But to me, Usagi Drop embodies everything that I want from a show. \\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop has left an impression on me that I will not soon forget.  And I am ok with that.",

Characters get the time they need to grow on you, yet the pacing never drags it feet either. Other than a show like Clannad, which has the emotional sublety of a wrecking ball, it's emotional in places you may not expect it, and it can be beautiful or hard hitting with seeminglylittle effort. \\n\\n\r\nLike many anime, Usagi Drop is also great at including technical details without breaking with the flow, making it quite educational in an entertaining way.",

Usagi Drop however is that unique diamond amongst the rough, for it will, quite literally, from start to finish, warm your very heart.\r\nYou might expect the story of a 30-year-old bachelor taking in his relatives unwanted six-year-old child to be full of twisted fan-service or, even worse, lolita wish fulfillment.  Fortunately, the show doesn't sacrifice it's principles to chase those fair-weather fans, and instead focuses on telling a simple tale about the trials and tribulations of suddenlybecoming a parent. \\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop doesn't shy from the very real problems that a completely inexperienced adult would face when trying to raise a child, and that's what drives most of the episodes.  The surrogate father Daikichi is tested throughout, and more than once he questions his resolve.  Thankfully, if ever there was a child that could restore that will to go on, Rin is it.  Precocious, bubbly and effortlessly cute, she could make even the most ardent critics of children reconsider their stance.\\n\\n\r\nTo further make the show stand out, the art is an unusual blend of watercolor hues and soflty drawn characters.  It works remarkably well, and gives the world of Usagi Drop a very dreamy, almost nostalgic sort of quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe into/outro songs are fitting for the subject matter, and the title sequence itself has a wonderfully colorful and childlike design.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop was a refreshing surprise and a welcome deviation from the current anime norm.  If you're looking for an anime that will put a smile on your face from the start to end of each episode, then look no further.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Boy, did you find the right anime.\r\nUsagi Drop is a non-stop train to feel good town. The show starts off on a minor down note in order to set up all the characters and make you empathize with them, but even by the end of episode 1 the cute and fluffy starts. By the time you hit the last episode you'll be riding high on a wave of happy.\r\nYou will be moved by the selflessness and genuine kindness in this series, and even thoughthe story is not a particularly unique one, it is a timeless and heartfelt story that should resonant with any but the blackest of hearts. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10. A great anime. The only reason I don't give this full marks is because: 1) I wish there was more (I even watched the X.5 episodes and wished I could've seen more), 2) Nothing about the art/sound/characters was particularly revolutionary or mindblowing. \\n\\n\r\nI tend to save the almighty 10/10 for those shows that are truly breathtaking. However, this show is as good as a show can get without being breathtaking. It is flawlessly executed and masterfully written. Well worth your time and money.\\n\\n\r\n(Something of note: there is a stigma in Japan against single parenthood, more so than in the West. It is also extremely uncommon for men to be the single parent as well. Japan has far fewer safety nets for single parents than a lot of western countries, so it is much more difficult to raise a child by yourself. Keep this in mind as you watch this series, I found this knowledge made the first few episodes much more pointed and meaningful.)",

Although the relation can look a little bizarre the truth is there are  men around the world having  to deal daily with similar situations. In my opinion a manthat take the determination to do what the protagonist of this manga did, I can say that man is a real Super Hero. \\n\\n\r\nThe only negative aspect is in the manga because once someone really decides to be  father or son, the change of rolls is not possible. Luckily the anime took the right way and I strongly recommend to watch this anime. do not wait an action anime instead enjoy of an anime with a great message of love.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Usagi Drop is a heartwarming SOL anime about a man called Daikichi who gets to take care of a 6 year old Rin. It does seems like a standard SOL anime with its share of cute and educating moments as the characters progress through life; but the anime was so much more. Beneath all the gleeful moments the anime subtly portrayed the tensions and  care that is required to successfully raise a child. Raising a child in itself is a difficult task, more so if the child is an adopted one. The anime goes further than just the joy associated with the experience itshows the adequate grief too. It doesn't show the intricate details of the process but still delves deeper into the territory than most anime prefer to go to. This creates a balance between the serious story and the light moments the anime tries to go for; besides who would be interested in a super serious anime about raising a child and the patience and anger that attaches itself with the endearing process. The show goes for the cute and happy moments associated with the process and succeeds largely to pull the masses. The theme of parents sacrificing their own life is present throughout the anime but sometimes was forced down on the viewers. Don't get me wrong, I know my parents have sacrificed a lot for me, I reckon yours have done the same, but the end fact remains that they do not tell much about their sacrifices to me. This anime especially in few episodes that center around the said theme talks about the same with enthusiasm and sometimes with over enthusiasm which feels forced. The characters and their design/art beautifully complemented the story.  Diakichi was a lazy man with a strong set of morals which prevented him from abandoning Rin. He took her in out of pity and learnt how to care for her along the way. He was tired but was determined to give her the best. He did not know the right way, yet he was determined to learn it and not just wing it as the time comes. This showed his earnest nature when he asked a co worker about tips to manage both work and personal life. Another thing that the anime managed to get spot on was progress of the character's inter personal relationship. Even though Daikichi got the custody of Rin, even though he wanted to raise her for a certain time, he wasn't ready to abandon his own world for her. Though, over time and after being exposed to other parents and acknowledging their sacrifices he gradually started learning what it meant to a parent and what it meant to love and take care of a kid. He then left his job and transferred to a lower post to take better care of Rin. She too didn't trust him and other people at the beginning and was terrified of outsiders but overtime got attached to them. The way this relationship was portrayed was commendable as it was synonyms with real life. The art too was bit rough and felt quite real and thus attached itself brilliantly to the story. The soundtracks too were rightly placed and gave a fuzzy and warm feeling which elevated the feelings the anime was trying to achieve. \\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, Usagi Drop was a beautiful anime about the trails and hardships a person encounters while being a working parent and the joy the associated with the little things the kids do. It is a must watch for any SOL anime fan and would be fantastic addition to their watch list.",

To be honest, I wasn\u2019t sure if my lack of interest in parenthood would keep me from fully enjoying the series but these thoughts were quickly put to bed.  Right off the bat I was hooked!  This is truly one of the purest and most gentle series I\u2019ve seen.  Every second I watched, the characters would draw me in more and more, and by the end I felt almost at home in their world.  \r\nWhile everyone knows that being a parent is difficult, watching a man takeon that responsibility for a little girl who he had met earlier the same day was incredible, and was a great jumping off point to get me interested and invested in the first episode.  The art style felt warm and welcoming, which complimented the tenderness of the series greatly.  While our main characters were certainly in the spotlight for the majority of the series, the side characters were no less enjoyable to watch.  Each character had enough depth to them to keep me interested in learning more.  Each had their own set of problems in life and seeing these characters develop throughout the series was wonderful.  At no point in the show did I ever feel a lull in the story.  With the end of each episode I was excited and looking forward to the next.  \\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop is an easy recommendation for me to make.  It\u2019s simple in its presentation but profound in its content.  It was calming and sweet but still left me thinking about my own life.  For those who appreciate beauty in simplicity and need some chicken soup for your soul, this is a must watch!\\n",

            "content": "This is my first slice of life anime and I have to say, if this is what to expect, I'm going to be a big fan.  Usagi Drop starts with a simple yet entirely novel premise: after his grandfather dies, middle-aged bachelor Daikichi Kawachi and the rest of the family discover that the old man had an illegitimate daughter, Rin Kaga, by a much younger woman.  With her mother nowhere in sight, Rin is not only alone but also shunned by her only family.  When someone raises the prospect of sending her to an orphanage, a fed up Daikichi offers to takeher home.  The story follows Daikichi's struggles in raising a young girl alone, and the development of the bond between them. \\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop is heart-wrenchingly beautiful.  I had to hold back the waterworks on multiple occasions (and once or twice to no avail).  It's the sort of story that will make a grown man bawl, especially if he has kids.  Because the plot is necessarily mundane - a slice of life about raising a child - the show focuses almost entirely on character development, and as a result Daikichi and Rin are wonderfully dynamic.  It is simply delightful to watch Daikichi's entire person evolve as the result of a single selfless act.  Initially a bachelor who smokes and frequently works overtime, he gradually gives up his entire life in order to care for a child who is not his own.  Rin is easily one of the sweetest, saddest, and cutest characters ever created, and thanks to Daikichi is able to develop from a scared and lonely child left behind by the world into a confident, warm, and genuinely happy little girl.  Although the story is generally about Daikichi and Rin learning to live together, there are several nice subplots that keep the story from getting stale: Daikichi's interactions with Rin's mother; Rin's interactions with the other kids at school, especially Kouki; and Daikichi's potential romance with Kouki's single mother, Yukari.  These also help to add a sense of suspense over whether Rin's mother will try to take her away from Daikichi, and whether Daikichi and Yukari will end up together.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I clearly loved this show, I have to pause for a moment to let out some frustration, and I'll be sure to tread carefully so as not to spoil anything.  In the final three or four episodes, the story focuses heavily on a particular subplot and hints at a resolution.  Yet rather than finishing strong with a decisive and happy ending, we're left with a cliffhanger.  Understandably dissatisfied and confused, I took to the forums to see why things ended the way they did, only to find that the manga provides a clear, and frankly deeply disappointing, explanation.  Conscious of my role of reviewing Usagi Drop the anime rather than Usagi Drop the manga, I can nevertheless say that this revelation fundamentally altered my perspective of the show, and I strongly recommend against reading the manga.  End unfortunate digression.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond a very touching story, Usagi Drop features a surprisingly beautiful and memorable collection of piano tracks that complement the story's emotional side perfectly, (e.g., Ketsui), as well as some nice slice-of-life themes (e.g., Koigokoro).  The animation, which essentially feels like you're watching a children's storybook come to life, also complements the show well, despite its lack of detail or beauty.  The voice actors are on the whole very good, and Ayu Matsuura was an excellent pick for Rin. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end Usagi Drop is unlike any anime I've ever seen.  Perhaps it's par for the course for slice of life anime, but I really felt connected to the characters and their story in a way that few shows have ever been able to accomplish.  Maybe I'm just a sucker for sweet stories, but this is absolutely a show I would recommend, and definitely one I won't soon forget.",

Usagi Drop is one of them.\r\nDaikichi is a 30 year old that works hard and plays hard, living the single life to the full although without much success with the ladies. Whilst at is grandfather's funeral he sees a strange girl, called Rin, playing by herself, ignored by the rest of his family, who he is told it his grandfather's daughter. Appalled at the suggestion to put her in care Daikichi decides without thinking it through to take her home and his life changes forever.\r\nDaikichi's life changes completely. He has todeal firstly with a frightened and insecure little girl, find day care for Rin when he is at work, skepticism of his family that he can cope and a new life work balance.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly Daikichi's work life changes as he has to take a lower paid job in his company as being a salesman doesn't allow him the time to look after Rin. This isn't a bad thing. It means he builds new relationships at work with people at work who have children and are more than happy to give him advice whenever he needs it.\\n\\n\r\nDaikichi also finds that being a single Dad gives him a lot of female attention including the good looking divorced mother of Rin's best friend at day care.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Rin starts elementary school Daikichi's changes dramatically. Out goes heavy drinking sessions and in comes trips to the park with other parents and their children.\\n\\n\r\nDaikichi also gets new respect from his family for coping with the task of raising a child by himself and accept Rin very quickly as one of them.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop has some very strong characters. Daikichi is becomes more and more likable as he warms to the task of looking after Rin. Rin is cute without being annoying. There is also the difficult story of Rin's mother, Masako, a manga artist who throws herself into her work to the point of affecting her health to forget the guilt of abandoning Rin and Daikichi's cousin, Haruko, who is trapped in an unhappy marriage caused by an overbearing and interfering mother-in-law.\\n\\n\r\nThe art has a soft water colour feel to it and fits the anime perfectly as the the opening song and animation.\\n\\n\r\nIt may seem there are a lot of spoilers in this review but trust me there isn't and it is difficult to fault Usagi Drop.\\n\\n\r\nI hope there is a second season as the story of Rin's mother and her reasons for abandoning her aren't really resolved and whether Haruko will find happiness in her marriage.\\n\\n\r\nThis a josei anime but it is really an inspiration for any fathers or fathers to be out there.",

            "content": "The first 26 chapters of the manga/11 episodes of the anime is perfect! It's loveable, likable, adorable and relatable. Most people will give it 9 stars. However, after the time skip things went landslide. I really enjoyed the show tho.\r\nDestroying their own masterpiece as if they started hating what they initially loved doing. The way I can compare it as would be marriage. You start by being boyfriends and girlfriends that's where the thrill is, that's where most romance story starts and ends with marriage right? While it's common that high level of difficulties arises during marriage and some do inevitably go for divorce orsimply split. It's the same with this show.\\n\\n\r\n Now with the spoilers.\\n\r\n [spoiler]After Ch.26 it goes to a time skip with Rin in 1st year of High School. Rin started to develop romantic interest for Daikichi not as a father but as a man. Rin never considered Daikichi as a father since Daikichi is just Daikichi. [spoiler]\\n\\n\r\nHere's my personal version of continuation of anime ending.\\n\r\nDaikichi and Kouki's Mom, Yukari Nitani started a relationship with Daikichi and eventually got married. Create few common family problems and have character developments after that goes to time skip to High School. After all those years, Rin still loves Daikichi as a man. Rin confesses her bottled up feelings and gets rejected by Daikichi. \"Rin, I am sorry. But to me you will always be my daughter. Even though I am not your biological father, I am still your parent at heart. I love Nitani-san.\" She then gets heartbroken and Kouki consoles her. She then soon falls in love with Kouki which creates the other taboo. Since Daikichi and Kouki's mom are married, they are basically step-siblings but they are not really family related. Remember she kept her last name Kaga? It still creates that taboo of step-sibling or simply sibling love taboo. Story goes on with that. I think this version of story is way better. It's my personal version ~Kevin Gundran. Thank you for reading.",

            "content": "There are some very few rare cases when an adaptation overcomes it's original material; Usagi Drop being one of these. The series itself having a very simple premise: How difficult and rewarding raising a kid is. It revolves around the life of Kawachi Daikichi and  the secret daughter of his just deceased grandfather.\r\n     Story (9/10)\r\nAlbeit simple, the story feels really fresh and has many interesting characters in it, from Daikichi's cousin's dysfunctional (and rather oppressive) family to Kouki's hardworking single mother and Daikichi's coworker, all great characters on their own right who in some way or the other contribute onshowing Daikichi how to get the hang of being a parent and are helped out in turn (There's also some crappier character whose only good trait is her seiyuu, not pointing at anyone *cough* L\u0336a\u0336l\u0336'\u0336C\u0336S\u0336h\u0336i\u0336k\u0336i\u0336S\u0336h\u0336i\u0336n\u0336o\u0336b\u0336u\u0336M\u0336o\u0336t\u0336o\u0336k\u0336o\u0336L\u0336e\u0336i\u0336l\u0336a\u0336A\u0336l\u0336i\u0336s\u0336a\u0336M\u0336e\u0336r\u0336l\u0336i\u0336n\u0336J\u0336e\u0336a\u0336n\u0336n\u0336e\u0336E\u0336t\u0336o\u0336Q\u0336u\u0336i\u0336n\u0336e\u0336l\u0336l\u0336a\u0336Masako *cough*). Many topics are explored such as the sacrifices some parents have to make in order to raise their children, these going from asking for a demotion to get out earlier to not having a social/romantic life. The story is ever progressing with Daikichi always discovering new things about parenting and getting to be a true loving family with Rin and her getting more mature (not in the anime way) by the episode. \\n\\n\r\nAs a note, the pacing may be a little bit slow to the one not used to slice of life anime, then again this IS a SoL anime so if you don't like those don't watch this.\\n\\n\r\n     Art (7/10)\\n\r\nNot much to say here, It has a Shojo-esque (or J\u0336o\u0336J\u0336o\u0336DIO-esque if you prefer) style that fits quite well, the color palette is usually not too saturated amplifying the feels one gets while watching. The animation is average but the expressions are spot on, overall It compliments the slice of life theme quite well.\\n\\n\r\n     Sound (8/10)\\n\r\nIt's this high mostly because good voice acting and the fact that as long as you keep good ambientation you are pretty much set for success in this genre.\\n\\n\r\n     Character (9/10)\\n\r\nHere Usagi Drop shines, as many characters feel real and one gets to see the struggles they go trough and how they get over them. It is not the appearance or appeal of characters that triumphs here, but It's complete opposite, that being the innocence and naivete the characters display which allows one to empathize with them.\\n\\n\r\n     Enjoyment (10/10)\\n\r\nUsagi Drop is a truly endearing and heartwarming story, one that everyone probably would enjoy after a certain age, It is not meant to have action or romance in it (unlike Its twisted parent story), and that's what keeps It great.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Usagi Drop is one of 2011 summer's Noitamina shows and it is one damn good show at that. Based on the manga of the same name by Unita Yumi and produced by Production IG, Usagi Drop is a slice of life show that brings a somewhat realistic touch to what faithful parenting should be about.\r\nWhat can go wrong when a 30 year old businessman adopts his grandfather's illegitimate grandchild? One would think 'a lot.' A 30 year old man taking in his 6 year old aunt? Not something you hear everyday. Thus begins the journey of Kawachi Daikichi and Kaga Rin as they live together,cry together, and eventually love each other as a family.\\n\\n\r\nThe progression of the story doesn't involve great dramatic climaxes or severe character trauma. It simply tells us the every day life of two people living in a world that's flipped upside down for them (Daikichi in particular). Daikichi is a selfless man as he takes care of Rin. Yet he is as straightforward as he is compassionate about those around him. He strays far from the stereotypical high school male lead who's dense and stupid most of the time. Rin on the other hand, is as mature as a young child can get. At only 6 years old, she thinks for herself and asks questions that even Daikichi sometimes are flabbergasted at. But of course, she is still as naive and curious as a 6 year old is. Together, it makes Rin as dynamic a character she can be.\\n\\n\r\nAs each episode passes, Daikichi learns something new about parenting. Rin learns to open up to the world before her after her father's (who she decidedly calls 'grandfather' instead) death. With each passing, these two grow closer together and develop a one of a kind relationship between a surrogate guardian and his 6 year old companion.\\n\\n\r\nOf course this doesn't just occur without the introduction of a supporting  cast that leads Daikichi in his revelations as a father figure. Two of the central supporting are Nitani Yukari and Nitani Kouki, a mother and son duo who befriends Daikichi and Rin. These two are crucial in both Daikichi's and Rin's characters as they grow into a sort of whole family. Daikichi not only is attracted to Yukari simply for her beauty, but for her efforts as a single mother as well. Rin and Kouki, well, they're both the same age and end up in the same school and class; they'd of course end up as childhood friends. Not only do they grow closer to their familial counterparts, Daikichi pretty much becomes a sort of father figure to Kouki and Yukari a mother figure to Rin. Together, it's almost as if they complete a whole family themselves. Add in several other support characters such as Daikichi's parents and coworkers, you have an all around cast that lends their hand in assisting Daikichi in growing as a father figure to Rin.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and characters are only one part of what makes Usagi Drop so pleasing. It's the aesthetic value of the show itself. The art consists of light water colored backgrounds and character designs. The characters break into some hilarious faces as the show goes on but never as annoyingly obnoxious like other shows can get. It adds a great mellow and lighthearted feel to the show. It's simplistic yet dynamic in its presentation.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is not flashy. It's not loud or obnoxious. It's simple melodies really add to the airy flair of the show. The little piano jingles perk up the scenes in light comedy and lightheartedness. The voice acting is great as well. The characters are not met with obnoxious sterotypical loud voices like typical loli voices but with realism. Matsuura Aya is simply astounding voicing Rin and Tsuchida Hiroshi pulls off Daikichi with near perfection.\\n\\n\r\nThe show may seem slow throughout the course, but it's a steady character driven piece that delivers consistently. Normally I'd pass up shows like this but I am always anxiously waiting for an episode every week. Usagi Drop is a breath of fresh air among all the loli harems and shounen action as of late. It's simplistic, it's homely, and it's soft presentation just draws you into the lives of these characters. Although the anime ends prematurely in comparison to the manga, Production IG has made a grand decision in ending the anime where it is.",

            "content": "Usagi Drop seems to be throwing me into the slice-of-life genre in a very charming way. I have watched six episodes so far, and I am utterly captivated by the halcyon atmosphere of this anime. \r\nStory 9:\r\n====\r\nThe story is quite simple indeed. Out of the blue, Daikichi decides to take Rin under his wings! A very surprising, and somehow far-fetched decision coming from a single man who has no experience whatsoever at raising a child. What's not surprising, though, is of course the fact that Daikichi's life is about to drastically change... Well, the idea of a single man suddenly thrown into the catacombs ofparenthood has been tackled so many a time before, so what's special about Usagi Drop? It is the PACE! The pace, at which this change comes through, is simply perfect. Each episode takes you by the hand, along with Daikichi, and makes you slowly sip this change like red wine. And just when you feel like this is going to be only a portrait of Daikichi and Rin's everyday activities, you are reminded about the origin of the whole situation, and you start getting answers for your questions: who is Rin's mother? Is she alive? Why has she abandoned her daughter? Would she wish to see her daughter... \\n\\n\r\nArt 7:\\n\r\n===\\n\r\nWell, although it is not fantastic, I believe it is perfect for the story. I mean, in such a slice-of-life anime, What you really look for is the general atmosphere. The art is simple, yet consistent and relevant. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8:\\n\r\n=====\\n\r\nBe it jocund, when Rin is enjoying her time, or nostalgic when Daikichi is searching through his grandfather's stuff... The music is very soothing indeed. Needless to mention that the piano background cannot but dazzle your feelings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9:\\n\r\n======= \\n\r\nTwo main characters: Daikichi and Rin; however, Daikichi is the most important focus of this anime. Rin is but a reflection of Daikichi's development. We get to see the \"change\" through his eyes, and we do await his next moves. Daikichi is but a romantic teenager in the head. Had he not been one, he would have never made such a decision. Portrayed as a considerate man right from the very first episode, Daikichi always tries to put himself in Rin's shoes. Goodhearted enough to accept this from the start, he is also a very good learner. Quite often you see Daikichi asking for advice, whether directly from his sister, or implicitly acquiring it by observing how other parents behave... Yet, the most important quality Daikichi's character lays on the table is LOVE. This huge sacrifice he is offering, simple to see a child's smile, is nothing but pure love. \\n\r\nRin, on the other hand, is just six years old, and so often she does behave as such... Yet, from time to time, we are reminded of her calamity: her father is dead, and she has no clue who or where her mother is. This is why we get to see her having qualms about being abandoned; these qualms are naturally displayed as nightmares from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10:\\n\r\n========\\n\r\nI could never understand how to explain this part. How can one explain or even rate \"enjoyment\". Well, as far as I'm concerned, I have enjoyed each and every episode of Usagi Drop so far, so that must be a ten. :) \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9:\\n\r\n=====\\n\r\nI recommend you watch this anime; that is, of course, if you are interested in experiencing some realistic sentiments for a change. It is a great show so far.",

All characters are unique, each character has it's own personality and ALL of them are lovable.

Definitely very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (9/10)\\n\r\nThere is really nothing bad in this show for me and I don't see anything that would prevent you from enjoying it.

            "content": "I will start this review by summarizing my thoughts. I got to this anime after watching an AMV called Ivy Bridge on youtube and good AMVs many times boost anime's real value, however. I will never regret the decision I made to watch this anime, as it was a really great one. \r\n9/10 Overall\r\nThe story itself is heart-touching. As it happens many times, people got used to being bystanders instead of having strong characters and being able to stand up at the right moment, and that actually make Usagi Drop an anime that captures me, as this fantasy world puts us in a world thatcould eventually be a real one. The only bad point I found during the whole anime about characters is that they do not have enough \"space\" to properly show how they really are. (Could give examples, however, I do not want to spoil the anime for those who didn't see it yet. I can only recommend rather sending me a message after you've seen the anime if you want to discuss it.)\\n\\n\r\n10/10 Story\\n\\n\r\nThe Art has its own unique aura, which lets the viewer feel like he/she is reading a full-color manga that came to life. Actually, I felt surprised by how much I liked it, as I have thought of such a thing to happen, but never thought that there is already an anime using that idea, also never thought that it will turn out so nice. \\n\\n\r\n10/10 Art\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds are pretty well made, I will not really talk much about this, but I felt like I have to mention that I did not get enough of some characters... such as some characters did not have enough strength in the story, could put an emphasis on this, but it's already another part of the review.\\n\\n\r\n9/10 Sound\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before I missed some character development, many characters could have had more than the anime brings us to know about them, but it's all fine as long all the sacrifice made on characters improved the stability of the main storyline. So we did not get too far away from what it was originally meant to tell.\\n\\n\r\n8/10 Characters\\n\\n\r\nSo, all in all, I fully enjoyed it and would actually recommend it to those who like animes filled with adorable little moments, but would also recommend to those who might have missed it out only because they put as a reason the art and design, they got my word that this anime will melt into their heart as it is, as a good story doesn't need to have graphics like The Garden of Words(it captures eyes, but won't make the story greater).\\n\\n\r\n10/10 Enjoyment \\n\\n\r\n=(^-^)=",

            "content": "I want to say that Usagi Drop was one of the better slice of life anime I've seen so far (having seen Toradora, Oregairu, Hanasaku Iroha, to name a few), but keep in mind that I've never written a review nor have I critically analyzed an anime before, so take whatever I say with a grain of salt.\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nThis is a slice of life genre anime, so of course story is going to lack a little bit. There is little cohesion between episodes, aside from the recurring cast of Rin and Daikichi, and the overall relationships between characters, which I'll get to later inthis review.\\n\\n\r\nHow the show itself begins wasn't necessarily a turn off for me, but as you can see from the synopsis, it's a \"different\" premise to start on, but that was only my real \"problem\", if I'd even call it that, with this show, but with this premise, we can see how the relationships can roll out through the course of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art-style of the series wasn't bad at all, but neither was it exceptional either. Why I decided to to give it such a high score was because of how they animated the characters, mostly in this case, Rin. When animating her different emotions, whether it was pouting or being smug, she was animated with dots for eyes, instead of the traditional large-ass anime eyes we're so accustomed with. \\n\\n\r\nAnother reason why I was so drawn to the art-style was of the different style they used before the OP of every episode. Before the opener, they would animate the frames and characters using a method that looked like watercolors, or some other sort of painting technique. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed both the OP and ED of this series, though if I were to choose, it probably be the opener over the closer. But really shines in this anime is the overall soundtrack used throughout the show. No bit of music sounded out of place, as if it fit every scene to create the mood it needed. Scenes that gave chase had a good fit track, where it felt frantic, assuming that was the idea the studio wanted to give out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly liked every character introduced in this series. Daddy Daikichi really cleans up his act after \"adopting\" Rin, though they never get to deep in his big party life he had before her. Even Daikichi's parents I came to like, as they removed their past ideas of ostracizing Rin (since she's the late granddad's illegitimate daughter) and came to accept Rin as their own \"granddaughter\". Of course, there was a lack of love for Rin's baby momma, but I don't want to get too deep into her, due to spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall Score - 10/10 and 8.8/10\\n\\n\r\nI love me good slice of life anime, and this really filled a place in my heart, at least enough to motivate me to write my first review for it. The wholesomeness, great soundtrack, and wonderful characters really bring this show up high in my list, making it a must-watch for anyone, as its cuteness would surely bring them in.\\n\\n",

But Daikichi loves Rin enough to take her in and love her like she is his own child.\r\nSTORY:\r\nThe background story of Daikichi's grandfather having an illegitimate child is interesting. Since this show is a slice of life there is not much plot to the show, but what I can say is that following Daikichi and Rin going about their lives is so much fun to watch.\r\nCHARACTERS:\r\nThere is little development of characters but that's what I expect from a sliceof life. Rin and Daikichi's relationship is so sweet and heartwarming. Rin is literally the cutest! She cares for Daikichi and others which I love about her.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nGreat art and animation!\\n\\n\r\nSOUNDS:\\n\r\nGood voice acting. I loved the OP and ED songs!! The OP song is now one of my favorite anime OPs!\\n\\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\\n\r\nThis is the kind of show that gives you a warm and fuzzy feeling inside when you watch it. You can see how much Daikichi and Rin love and care for each other which is amazing. This show has rightfully earned it's place as on of my favorite animes. 10/10 for me!",

Both from the perspective of the little girl, Rin, to whom everything about the world around heris new and unknown, and the middle-aged Daikichi, who has never had a child of his own, but does his very best to be a good father, and makes sacrifices of his own to make sure Rin is well.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorite episodes **SPOILERS** is one where Rin is upset that she is the very last one to get picked up at kindergarten because Daikichi works late, to the point where the institution is closed and she has to wait outside with the caretaker, until she gets picked up. Daikichi understands her frustration, and although he isn't making that much money to begin with, he has a talk with his boss to reduce his working hours, so that he can pick Rin up before it gets dark **SPOILER END**\\n\\n\r\nIf you like calm and gentle stories, that manage to touch your heart with very little, then this I can't recommend enough!",

            "content": "I wasn't planning on writing a review for this series. The show is older and many valuable and to the point reviews have already been written. I started re-watching the series on the weekend and as usual when it ended I was left wishing for more. Then I checked recommendations on MyAnimeList and was directed to Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai!. I watched it. These two series are really not on the same wave length. Yes, in both the circumstances leave a male relative caring for the child/ren of another, and yes they both do grapple with changed lifestyle and added responsibilities. But really theyare not alike. Let me put it to you this way. 50Cent lost his mother when he was 8 and I lost mine when I was 10. Now let me ask you this. Do you think I can rap like 50 Cent?\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nSynopsis is very accurate. That said, Usagi Drop is one of the loveliest slice of life anime out there. Despite being only 11,5 episodes long, the story surprisingly manages to be deep and serious and yet maintains an uplifting attitude and humor at the same time. So much so that when you are watching the episodes you don't actually fully grasp the seriousness of the topic. The serious part sort of hits you in the gut, when the episode has ended and you are actually basking in the afterglow of the pleasant experience. And then you think back, and realize, the anime did not make light of the topic in question, but simply managed to present it, in an uplifting manner. (e.g. parental abandonment and it's effects, marital discord etc.)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt is nothing \"fancy\" like the style that seems to be the \"usual\" these days. (Please forgive the quotation marks. I just don't know how to describe them, I am not trying to be sarcastic or overbearing.) \\n\r\nWhat I mean by that is, you won't find eyes sized half the face, ready to water up, or pouty lips that would make Angelina Jolie jealous, or hair that is glossy and shiny as if pearl dust has been spread over it. They look like normal people. And yet, Rin is exploding the cute-meter, Daikichi is adorable when he is slowly moving into his guardian mode and so on. In short, while it is not glossy, it is still very very fine. \\n\\n\r\nAudio:\\n\r\nThe seiyuus do an outstanding job. Considering this is a slice of life anime, if one of the characters sounds \"out of whack\" you are bound to go \"eeeek, what the heck was that, that type would never sound like that!\". But it never happens. Especially the kids. They never sound like 20-something year-olds that are trying to sound childish, nor do they sound over the top childish. They simply sound like children should sound. I have to admit, I watched the anime for the 6th or 7th time this weekend, but not once did I pay much attention to the opening nor the ending song, or to any other song in between for that matter. So I can't say anything about that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are great. No matter how short their role, they all get handled with TLC and get their depths. As for the main characters Rin and Daikichi, watching their development as persons as well as their interaction with others and with each other is all what this anime is about and it is a joy to follow.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI remember the first time I watched this anime. I was expecting something \"angst\"y to happen any second. But it didn't. This anime tells its story without creating drama for drama's sake. There are moments, you laugh, there are moments, you dither, there are moments you get a little frustrated or agitated. It just simply takes you over the board of emotions without going over the board. It stays real. I really enjoyed this anime fully.\\n\\n\r\nFacit, this is an excellent slice of life anime. If you are undecided, watch it. If the general tags \"slice of life, comedy\" are in your wheel of preferences, watch it. You won't be disappointed. But if you are looking something like Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai!, this is not your series. Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai! is slightly shoujo, slightly loli, slightly slice of life, slightly romance, slightly  something. Not my taste, but not bad. Usagi Drop is not loli, it is not shoujo. It is just not really similar to Papa no Iukoto wo Kikinasai!. But it is definitely worth trying!  \\n",

            "content": "USAGI DROP REVIEW:\r\nMINDSET:\r\nRealism is out of the ordinary for the Slice Of Life genre, since most of it some simplistic Harem or Moe shtuff I get bored of within the five minutes while being devoid of any sort of realsim and putting more emphasis on the monsters, panty shots, lasers, generic mains and a bunch of innuendos.\r\nSYNOPSIS:\r\nDaikichi is apparently some 30 year old bachelor, and apparently he discovers that he's granddad has an illegitimate child called Rin and due to rather excusable and understandable reasons, no one in the family wanted to look after the poor thing, so Daikichi decided what is most logical: toadopt her as a guardian.\\n\\n\r\nREVIEW:\\n\r\nUnlike most Anime which treats itself as an escapism fantasy that has less to no realism or depth at all, I'm serious when I say that Usagi Drop is one of those shows that You only see in a blue moon, especially if You consider this show being made in the 2010's when it was just too easy to make a simple Slice Of Life show that can target the masses, it is a show, at its time, deserves the value and recognition it gets for what it does.\\n\\n\r\nNow having said that, the show presents its themes and clearly focuses on them in \u201clegitimately mature\u201d context. It centers around the whole parenthood thing with Daikichi trying to take care of Rin like a parent, You see him going through situations that may happen in real life, like how he sacrifices some of he's free time, or just trying to pick Rin up from Kinder Garden at 7:00pm midnight due to work, and this is what I love about this show so much, sure its not real-life realistic (and that could a bad thing) but it still attains that simplistic, yet deep feeling for what its really like to look after a child.\\n\\n\r\nHas anyone noticed when Daikichi gotten the paperwork to adopt Rin, was never signed or authorised? Well, it did seem too easy when Daikichi decided to look after Rin without putting much thought into it, and how it kind-of came out of nowhere as if he only wanted to look after after her because of empathy. Though that\u2019s just a small bug I noticed after re-watching it...\\n\\n\r\nSince the show centres all around a realistic take on the Slice Of Life genre, it does seem semi-episodic with the whole Slice Of Life aspect, yet it there is always a piece of character development like Daikichi learning more about Rin through the duration, or how Rin becomes a happier girl.\\n\\n\r\nThough the show really does centre around Rin and Daikichi, the supporting cast had just enough screen time for You to know them well, but there really isn't much to talk about them other than that they fill the roles quite nicely like Reina, a completely bombastic little girl whose one of Rins friends always seemed fitting to act in this bombastic way at her age. The sidecast all have a purpose, and fit their roles and themes in the story quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nQuite a contradictory with Production I.G's work. What I like about this company is the very consistent budget without it ever feel like its dropping, but instead of them using the usual blended CGI graphics onto 2-D backgrounds without it looking like a complete fail, You gotta give some praise for the Animators using animated pastel drawings in the OP, and I really liked the start of an episode when the first 30 seconds of it uses a more artistic style, but even if it never done that, the Animation just feels, perfectly fitting for the whole light hearted yet mature \u201cLooking after a Child\u201d theme, as it uses such delicate colours and a lack of greys. Its very bright colour scheme feels very refreshing from all the greys or artificial-like backgrounds that most Anime tend to draw towards... And yes, Rin is the cutest thing ever... nuff said...\\n\\n\r\nWhat else is their to say for the OST? It fits the mood really, and its quite clear there wasn\u2019t that much effort put into it, nor it is bad. It's one of those Slice Of Life soundtracks You just hear, and then forget. The OP is great and You can skip the ED.\\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nEasily the best show when it was aired at its season, it is an Anime that I, anime critics and fans will remember this Slice Of Life for having the balls to tread over the bombastic and unrealistic or just plain boring tropes on what\u2019s really defining a Slice Of Life Anime... \\n\\n\r\nCRITICAL SCORE:\\n\r\n8/10 \u2013 The characters portray the mature themes very well.\\n\r\n7/10 \u2013 Story does seem semi-episodic, but its Slice Of Life, what is there to say?\\n\r\n7/10 \u2013 Animation fits the whole, looking after the child thing very well, with a brighter gradients and being more simplistic.\\n\r\n6.5/10 \u2013 OST is nothing special except for a memorable OP.\\n\\n\r\nCRITICAL FINALE: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nPERSONAL SCORE: (enjoyment)\\n\r\nI'm not the type of guy who is REALLY into the whole trying to look after a child kind of shows (like Wolf Children) though I feel genuinely immersed in the whole ordeal, I personally prefer more battle oriented themes, or something darker than general... Now because I've said that:\\n\\n\r\nPERONAL FINALE: 7/10",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW HAS SPOILERS\r\nStory: Usagi Drop has no particular plot, but that doesn't make it a bad thing. The anime still manages to maintain a very strong flow of direction and it sort of grows on you as you progress onto each episode. Usagi Drop is about a middle-aged man, Daikichi, who decides to take in and raise his grandfather's 6-year-old daughter, Kaga Rin. The story idea is very unique which helps to grab the attention of the average anime viewer. It presents the problem instantly, Rin needing a new home with one of the relatives. A lot of animes beat around the bush withits objective and it's great to see that this anime doesn't. The main character becomes the solution once he realizes no one wants the burden of a child and decides to take her in. The anime gives the viewer a new light, illustrating the hardships of parenting and the necessary sacrifices needed to be made. It's a journey for the main character and for us. I got to enjoy the journey Daikichi went through making sure Rin grew up properly and ensuring her happiness. Aside from the sappy stuff, the pacing was excellent. Nothing was rushed and nothing was too slow. The anime stayed consistent, although there is isn't really a way for it to go off track. There were no plot holes, although it is very hard to create one for such an anime like this. There was no particular ending to this anime, although I did wish it wouldn't end. There is no set amount of episodes that could have made this anime truly \"finish\". I guess it would officially end if Rin had her own kids? Who knows.\\n\r\nStory Rating: 10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art wasn't very good, I'll admit that. There are definitely many other animes that can outclass this one in terms of art and have been produced during that exact time and season. However, sometimes you don't need amazing art to tell a great day. The anime still manages to shine with some of its art and the way it illustrated it to the viewers, The way the anime presented the bell flowers in particular really caused them to have a great meaning. You may not agree with me on that one, but that's just how I feel.\\n\r\nArt Rating: 6\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  I felt that a lot of the characters were important, but I just want to highlight 3 of them in particular. I'll start with Daikichi. Daikichi is a prime example of many middle-aged adults with an above average job, yet no lovers. He clearly makes enough money to support a family if he can afford to live comfortable while paying for Rin's life expenses. He evolves as a character once he starts adopting Rin. He realizes the sacrifices he needs to make to keep Rin happy. He feels unsure if this is the right decision at first, but soon acknowledges the fact that Rin's happiness is actually his happiness. Daikichi has the most effect as the main character in Usagi Drop and I feel that this change really truly represented him of his familial love for Rin. As for Rin,throughout the anime, we notice Rin has a problem with dealing with lost loved ones, especially with grandpa. She wonders if Daikichi will die in her lifetime and Daikichi responds by saying that he won't go anywhere until she becomes an adult. Rin begins to be able to leave her past behind and realizes the more important things in front of her in her new life: Daikichu, Kouki, etc. The final character I wanted to mention besides these two is Kazumi. For those of you unfamiliar with her name, it's fine because she wasn't a very active supporting character but what I love about Kazumi is that she is the complete opposite of Daikichi. I'm sure some viewers, including me, were watching this anime and felt all this sacrifice stuff wasn't too bad. Kazumi lays down the hammer when she mentions how she doesn't feel ready for kids because she isn't willing to give up what she wants to do and what she has. Kazumi's characer offers a really good contrast to the idea of the series and Daikichi and Rin which is something I really like. As little of an effect some people thought she had, I felt that her role was a supporting character was a short, but crucial one.\\n\r\nCharacter Rating: 9\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I have nothing to say besides how emotional I became when this ended.\\n\r\nEnjoyment Rating: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall Average Rating: 8.75, which rounds up to a 9.",

Beautiful...\r\nFor the first time, I have seen a slice of life anime that actually offers slice of life and not weird shenanigans that are a bit too abnormal to relate to everyday life.\r\nNot everyone would be able to relate and enjoy this series because of its plot and theme. But for me, I never found each episode dull even if it's completely too ordinary. Each and every episode progression makes you grow fond of the characters and you can't seem to hate or blame them no matter how dense or ignorant they are. The art styleof this is not that detailed but it is decent enough for a show that was released in its time. I loved the transition of the art style from the start to end of an episode. The soundtrack is also very fitting and emotional. The openings and endings match the series very well and the background songs are well placed. I don't really watch series with Josei tagged on them but I swear that I realized that it was Josei after I finished it. It may seem to be tagged that way but I didn't really mind watching it and for someone who watches the counterpart, Seinen, I enjoyed this series very much. Overall, this show may be a masterpiece that has been overshadowed by many of its related series and that's one of the reasons why it is so underrated. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is not something that makes you go wow in awe or amazement that give you thrills but it is something that makes your feelings light and touches your heart gently with passion. If you're into these kinds of themes, I recommend it very much.",

Anyways, Usagi drop, it seems like being a father isn't so easy after all, but that doesn't mean it's also a liability, having a child is one of the best thingthat could happen to a person, whether it be by your own breed, or adopted, being responsible might be hard, but the fruit it bears in the end makes it all worth it. This show was also regarded as one of the most realistic anime out there, like situations such as the daily life of the girl, her thoughts on her own situation, the scary gossips behind her, the dad also suffers from anxiety, it may not seem like it, but clearly with no experience as a father you suddenly take up the role with little to no help, and with no mother too, can affect your sanity, however the father does his best and continues to learn together with the child walking on the strings of life.\\n\\n\r\nDaikichi Daikichiiii Daikichiiiiii!

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nDeciding to become a parent is no easy task. Not only do you sacrifice many of the liberties you once held dear but you also now have to worry about that precious little someone who is now in your life. With Usagi Drop, the show looks to explore what it means to be a parent and all of the difficulties associated with the job. And in the end, you are left with a smile on your face and a special place in your heart for the duo that is Daikichi and Rin.\r\nSTORY\r\nUsagi Drop sets us up with Daikichi,a man whose Grandpa just recently passed away. When visiting his funeral, he discovers that his Grandpa had a child before he died. This little girl, Rin, is taken in by Daikichi, and the story proceeds from there.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is pretty much the definition of slice-of-life. There is no story to be had within Usagi Drop. Rather, each episode takes the time to show off the characters and expand upon the meaning of being a \"dad\". The show is incredibly heartwarming and a joy to watch. Daikichi is obviously there to help Rin grow and mature. But at the same time, Daikichi grows as a person by having Rin by his side. He makes sacrifices, makes fatherly decisions, and goes out of his way to support the little girl who looks up to him so much.\\n\\n\r\nIn that regard, Daikichi's and Rin's relationship is best described as \"pure\". They understand one another and are always having each other's backs. It becomes apparent early on how much they rely on one another. But at the same time, they have the \"father-daughter\" relationship that is always precious. And the show does a nice job of showcasing this, especially because they are technically not even in that type of relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is very cute (mostly due to Rin), humorous, and sad at times. It does a nice job of letting the characters grow through the actions that they take and the different experiences that they have.\\n\\n\r\nMy only gripe would be that it ends too soon. I wasn't sure how it was going to end exactly, but when it did, while filled with the same happy tone as the rest of the show, I was left wanting more of the two I had grown so attached to. The show is three years old now at this point, so I am not sure if there will ever be a continuation. But we are at least left with a smile on our face when all is said and done.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThis is a tricky section. For the most part, Usagi Drop is \"plain\" looking. There are no extremely pretty scenes due to the style. However, it also helps to give the show a somewhat unique feel. At certain times, it almost feels as if the animation itself is a drawing (this is especially apparent before the OP for every episode). The show takes place in a relatively few amount of locations but they are filled with nice details such as background people movement or the swaying of trees and flowers. I also found the character movements to be nicely done, especially with Rin. It is more difficult to get the actions of a child down-pat (since the people doing the animating are not children themselves), but I feel like Production I.G. did a wonderful job in that regard.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter design-wise, I enjoyed it. I liked the contrast between the tall and lanky Daikichi with the small yet pretty Rin. Rin's facial expressions were also nothing less than adorable. Whenever she was smiling on screen, you were too.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nI love kids. So I am going to be slightly biased here when I say that I loved the characters. It is rare to see such a nicely done child character like Rin, but when it is done as well as it was here, it makes the experience that much more special. I adored Rin's smile, the way she talked, how she interacted with Daikichi, and her overall positive attitude about everything. She was a star whenever she was present, always attracting your attention to what she was doing at that moment.\\n\\n\r\nBesides her actual being, her development is also looked at. She learns to cope with particular feelings and how to deal with the troubles of growing up. She expresses her ideas on subject matters and relies on Daikichi when she needs to. It's a joy to see her grow up into a \"young lady\" (as she puts it!) and I only have complete love for her character.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other notable character (and rightly so) is Daikichi. Daikichi also \"grows up\" himself. He learns what it means to be a dad, he sacrifices parts of his life to help the one he now holds dear, and he learns to make adult decisions not only for Rin but for himself as well. I really liked seeing him become such a good parent. He starts off unable to really deal with the situation at hand but he slowly learns to deal with the problems thrown his way.\\n\\n\r\nDaikichi learns these things due to Rin and the minor characters, such as with Kouki and Kouki's mother Nitani. Many of the arcs feature minor characters that give Daikichi insight into what it really means to be a parent. And this happens for almost every single episode. Daikichi is constantly learning that there is more to being a \"dad\" than just having a child. And that is what the show does so well with his character; he is always evolving.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, I enjoyed both the OP and the ED. I can't seem to find a link with audio, but both the OP and the ED have nice catchy tunes and lyrics that are easy to follow.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the soundtrack, there was one piece in particular that stood out to me. It and its variations were always nice to hear. The rest of the soundtrack is also nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I want to note the performance of Rin. I believe I had read it somewhere here, but I wanted to double check. The VA for her was actually a 10 year-old child, and she did a splendid job. Her voice worked beautifully with Rin's character, and should be used as an example of how child voice acting should be done.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nTo put it simply, I loved this anime. I said previously that I love kids. And to that extent, I hope to be a father one day. So I think this show struck some sort of chord with me. I know they are not real, but part of me wishes to have the same sort of loving relationship that Daikichi and Rin have with my own daughter if I ever have one. They are a simple, innocent, and kind-hearted duo, but there is more love between them than many other pairings in this medium.

            "content": "Usagi Drop is the story of a little girl and a grown up man who raises her despite having little relation with her. It depicts the hardships faced by the man as he tackles the difficulties that come his way upon choosing this new lifestyle. Though most of the episodes are happy and give a nice warm feeling, some do show the problems that come when raising a child.\r\nStory 9/10:\r\nThe story is pretty easy to understand. A small girl taken into the care of a man who has no experience whatsoever. He changes his ways of living just to make it better for the girl.Along the way, he meets other parents who are in a similar situation as him. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\r\nThe artwork for this anime is good. Not too action-y and not too shoujo. It gives the nice atmosphere this anime is supposed to give. Some soft and warm.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10:\\n\r\nI didn't find the theme songs anything exceptional to be mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10:\\n\r\nOur main protagonist is Kawachi Daikichi. A 30 year old man who works in a company and goes mostly into overtime. He lives alone but his life changes when he takes into his care Kaga Rin.\\n\r\nKaga Rin is the little girl around which the story focuses. She comes from an unusual background. She stays with Daikichi. The anime shows almost a year of their life together.\\n\r\nOther characters that have importance are Rin's mother, Daikichi's family, Kouki and his mother.\\n\r\nThere are some disputes but most of it is people helping each other out.\\n\r\nNow, one thing must be noted that this is a slice of life and not a romance anime. So, if you are expecting some romance, it's best to remove that thought. (Though there are some really strong \"would-be\" couples)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10:\\n\r\nI was in search of a good slice of life anime similar to Barakamon. Usagi Drop is a bit more serious but it was definitely what I wanted to watch. Happy and warm relations among people, helping each other out and a happy ending for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, as a slice of life anime, this is really a good watch. I completed it in 2 days. It's definitely a good anime for those looking for some warm happy anime with some good lessons about reality.",

            "content": "Story \u2013 Daikichi is a thirty year old man. Rin is his grandfather\u2019s six year old daughter born out of wedlock. After Rin\u2019s father dies unexpectedly, who will take care of her? Everyone present at the funeral treats her like an outcast and no one wishes to take responsibility\u2026except for one man: Daikichi. However, Daikichi has never taken care of a child! How will his life change now that has Rin? \r\nCharacters \u2013 The characters are so special in this anime because they feel so realistic and relatable to. Daikichi is a single man who hasn\u2019t had anything exciting happen in his life since becomingan adult. He is patient, kind, and also a dedicated worker. He has a face that may be somewhat intimidating, but Daikichi is anything but that. His new \u201cdaughter\u201d, Rin, is a young child who is both innocent and mature at the same time. While acting mature in many situations (she can even cook for herself), she also has a childish side to her. It is quite adorable to watch and share her happiness. We meet several other characters, such as Kouki, who is a boy in Rin\u2019s class and his mother. Kouki is extremely energetic and felt the most lifelike of all the characters in the anime. We also meet Rin\u2019s cousin who likes to come over to play as well. There are some other parental figures introduced in the anime, like Rin\u2019s mother, Daikichi\u2019s parents, and the parents of the other students in Rin\u2019s class. Though they do not play as major of a role, they all help support the story and aid in character development. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation \u2013 As expected from Production I.G , the animation was spot on. It worked impeccably alongside the simple, yet appealing artwork that formed Bunny Drop. The beginning of each episode always starts off with scenes that look almost as if it\u2019s a moving watercolor painting. It was so unique that I actually wished the entire anime to be in this style.  The rest of the episodes are filled with bright, soft colors that fit the atmosphere perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nMusic \u2013 As far as music in Bunny Drop, there is not anything extremely special or memorable. However, for a show that is so accurate to real life, I feel as if there was no need for a huge musical score to back it up. The opening and ending songs were both cute and fit the anime really well though.\\n\\n\r\nPros \u2013 The constant, accurate sense of realism was prominent in this anime. It shapes the anime for what it really is; natural and kind-hearted. There are no exaggerations or deceptions, just normal daily interactions. This anime emulated human communications so well that I almost felt like I was watching real people instead of anime characters. Of course that can have its downsides as well, but for most of Bunny Drop, it was a very positive quality. \\n\\n\r\nAlso the character development was marvelous. Our two main protagonists grew so well in just a short span of 11 episodes. I\u2019ve seen anime where it takes almost 25 episodes for one character just to develop some sort of personality! Rin changes from being shy and quiet to fun and outspoken. She is able to make a lot of friends at school and warms up to Daikichi as the anime continues. Daikichi develops more slowly, but he does become more understanding and less clueless when it comes to parenting as the anime goes on.  The bond between Daikichi and Rin increasingly strengthens with each episode, making Bunny Drop a very uplifting watch. \\n\\n\r\nCons \u2013 Many scenes in this anime were peaceful\u2026\\n\\n\r\na little too peaceful. Nothing extremely exciting occurred and while that isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, I did dose off a couple of times. A lot of the moments we see are very relatable and almost makes you feel like you are watching real human interactions. That can be great to watch, but not so great if it\u2019s putting you to sleep.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 Bunny Drop is a sweet, relaxing, and warm-hearted watch. It is definitely an anime that fans of all genres can enjoy. It might be a little too slow or too simple for some, but its simplicity is what makes Bunny Drop so special.\\n\\n\r\nRating \u2013 8.5/10",

            "content": "Bunny Drop or Usagi Drop is a Japanese jousei manga series by Yumi Unita (Manimani, Parapara Days, Yoningurashi.) Bunny Drop\u2019s story focuses on a thirty-year-old Daikichi that becomes the guardian of Rin, the illegitimate six-year-old daughter of his grandfather. Usagi Drop was serialized in the monthly magazine Feel Young from October 2005 to April 2011. An anime adaptation by Production I.G aired in Japan between July 7, 2011 and September 15, 2011. A live-action film adaptation of this manga premiered in Japanese theaters on August 20, 2011. The series was released on four Blu-ray Disc/DVD volumes between October 28, 2011 and January 27, 2012, eachcontaining a bonus mini-episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime centers on Daikichi, who takes a break from his busy life only to attend the funeral of his grandfather. Daikichi is 30: he is a very hardworking individual, who has never thought about his love life. During the funeral he meets relatives who are discussing the fate of his grandfather\u2019s daughter and his aunt, Rin. Rin is only six and she is now literally alone in the world; there is no information on her mother, too. She is very shy and very quiet and for some reason her only relatives do not even care about her future: they simply find it too boresome to adopt the little angel, Rin. In the end, they decide to send her to an orphanage\u2026 Daikichi becomes enraged by indifference of his relatives and decides to adopt Rin. His life will change now. \\n\\n\r\nIt might be too difficult sometimes to find a proper slice of life: forced drama, unrealistic relations, comedy ruining seriousness, fanservice, etc, etc, and etc; at some point you just become bored and you do not care how an anime will end. Usagi Drop is absolutely different. It is one of the most realistic SoL titles you will ever find and it has everything any SoL needs to offer: a real life story, drama, comedy, and an amazing cast you will fall in love with. There is, however, one thing I would like to focus your attention on: Usagi Drop does have an ending, a very good one, but if you wish to know more about this title, I highly recommend you to read the manga, too. I cannot guarantee you that you will love the ending, but one thing is clear, you will either love, or hate it, but later about it. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that you might dislike about Usagi Drop is its artistic approach. What I am trying to say is that the series switches between realistic pictures and some child\u2019s drawings. On top of that, character designs sometimes are just ugly; take Daikichi, for example. However, after some time you will be charmed by the animation and it will do its magic; just be patient, you will get used to it.  Sound wise, both opening and ending themes amazingly fit the series, they are worth listening to over and over again, especially with the amazingly beautiful artwork. Japanese voice actors also did a great job making their characters be more realistic. P.S. You simply must find and watch full clip of Usagi Drop\u2019s opening theme \u2018PUFFY - Sweet Drops.\u2019  \\n\\n\r\nBut as enjoyable as the animation is, Bunny Drop shines in presenting realistic characters in realistic situations, doing realistic things. Usagi Drop focuses on father-daughter relationships of Kawachi Daikichi and Kaga Rin. Kawachi Daikichi, as it has already been mentioned before, is 30. He is an absolutely normal man, who is not an otaku, a hardcore gamer, or anything else. He is actually a hero, because he saves Rin by becoming her guardian. He does not like children, has his own life, but he is not similar to his relatives that simply do not care about the future of Rin. Kaga Rin is a six-year-old girl and the illegitimate daughter of Daikichi's grandfather, Souichi Kaga. She is very quiet and somewhat careful when it comes to any communication with an adult. However, she is able to finally feel the true happiness of having a family when Daikichi decides to become her guardian. \\n\\n\r\nThat said, Usagi Drop offers its viewer a very realistic and perhaps dramatic story of an abandoned \u2018rabbit\u2019 and her new dad. Being a huge fan of the genre, this title was a great success for me and if you are also a fan of SoL anime, you will enjoy Usagi Drop. However, I should also mention that if you read the manga, you might start to hate Usagi Drop, so I would not recommend you to do that. Stick with the anime and just forget about it. Still, it is not for me to decide. With that being said, I give Usagi Drop a solid ten out of ten. Usagi Drop is a truly realistic and heartwarming story that might make you want become a better dad, or mother. It is, indeed, not a show for kids: there are many things to analyze, which I have not mentioned in this review and simply things that kids will find boring and will not understand. However, if you can call yourself an experienced viewer, as well as a fan of the genre, I highly recommend you to watch Usagi Drop.",

            "content": "Usagi Drop may sound like a very mundane anime from the description and synopsis but it is different from the mainstream anime that is popular at the moment.\r\nNow if you're looking for some weird fetish between a loli and a grown man, you are definitely in the wrong place. Usagi drop is a nice slice of life anime that warms the heart with moments that can be shared between a tight-knit family. I myself am a young adult male and I found myself thinking to the future about having a daughter of my own and sharing a close bond with her too.\r\nThe fact that theguardian in the story is still learning to be a parental figure makes the story even more interesting because it shows the growth of Daikichi as a guardian and Rin as she is literally growing up.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style and animation is pastel and soft which helps the lightheartedness of the series and is good for this type of slice of life anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are ones that you grow to love and the relationship between Daikichi and Rin is one that will warm you to the core because of how innocent both characters are as they become newly formed family. The secondary cast also provide great comedic relief but also act as a \"foil\" to enhance the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nIf I could improve something about the anime, it would be the problem of Rin's biological mother. Rin's mother is briefly mentioned and problems between her, her boyfriend, and her internal struggles are introduced but not gone into.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this anime and would recommend if you are looking for a nice anime to watch as a break between other hectic action-packed anime and are looking for something to calm down to.\\n\\n\r\nStory:9/10\\n\r\nArt:8/10\\n\r\nSound:8/10\\n\r\nCharacters:9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9/10",

The story itself might not be anything special, rather it's the simplicity that makes it so much better. Jumping in and doing a good deed for someone who's in need of your help but can't request it. It's something that the protagonist of this anime does all too well. A fantastic job all around!\r\nGoing into this anime, I was a bit concerned that he'll have many regrets throughout but the MC was legit concerned anddid everything he could to help Rin. He was kind, thoughtful and went the distance. He was more than willing to make lifestyle changes as required and overall, the whole experience has been rather enlightening for him. What was also nice to see was how the characters interacted with each other and changed their perceptions overtime. \\n\\n\r\nThey were all pretty believable characters and fit into the story really well. The story progression and pacing was also on key especially considering that this anime was only 11 episodes long (would've been even better if there was another cour!). The art reminds me highly of 3 gatsu which is currently airing and I'm a huge fan of that. I personally believe that it fits in well with the tone that the anime is trying to convey and is also pleasant to the eye. \\n\\n\r\nSome tears were shed here and there but at the end of it all, between the tough scenes, the comedy and faces, the characters and everything else, it was a highly enjoyable experience matched by few anime out there. The anime touches on the hardships of rejection and being a single parent as well as all the pleasures that come with taking care of a little girl or guy. Overall, a really heartwarming anime to watch and a must for any anime fan!",

            "content": "tl;dr: A story about a pseudo father-daughter relationship that is really cozy.\r\nUsagi Drop is an anime that is essentially focused on a relationship between a father like figure and a daughter like figure. This is a bond that isn't seen often in anime as far as I know, certainly not at the level seen here where it very much is the core of the anime. Really, parenthood in general isn't a theme often seen in anime, so that this anime seems to focus on that entirely without ever really focusing on anything beyond that, even tangentially, makes it pretty interesting even without much variety. Theshow starts out pretty plot oriented, with him adopting her, having to change his lifestyle to accommodate her, as well as the drama involving her actual mother. Throughout this though, there is a focus simply on showing off Daikichi and Rin interacting, which is slow, but really happy and cute. As the show goes on, this more serious plot focus begins to drop, and it begins focusing more and more simply on the simple every day interactions. However, this isn't an issue at all, because the start sets up a strong foundation where the viewer begins to get heavily invested in Daikichi and Rin, and furthermore begin to enjoy watching Rin simply being Rin. Hence, even though there isn't anything major going on, as the show itself acknowledges, caring about the small things is enough, and though words such as exciting or engaging don't really fit, it does give a good sense of satisfaction and contentedness.\\n\\n\r\nI wasn't much of a fan of the somewhat rough art style and felt that it looked off at times, though the animation was good. The soundtrack wasn't particularly memorable. The OP/ED had good music and visuals, with the visuals of the ED changing being a nice touch.",

            "content": "First off, this anime is excellent. It really has a great story in my opinion. Myanimelist categorizes it as an josei, but I can see how it could be a seinen. There probably isn't going to be too many guys watching this, at least my age (younger), but I appreciate a good story and a good slice of life just as good as anything else. I've only seen two episodes, but I know this is going to be one of the best animes I've ever seen in many ways. Ironically, being a music major, I didn't pay much attention to the soundtrack, but I guessthere wasn't one. The only real thing I dislike is the opener and ending theme. But that's just my taste. (That is along the lines of Josei, I suppose.) I could watch this in one sitting, but I'll just wait on Crunchyroll one week at a time. My piece of advice, which is for any anime, watch episode one and try it for yourself.",

            "content": "\u201cWhat life is\u2026\u201d\r\nStory\u2026\r\nUsagi Drops gives a heartwarming story where a man meets a little girl, not knowing what path they will take towards their life, as both of them doesn\u2019t know at first that fate brings them together. It is sort of a realistic story as this man \u201cDaikichi\u201d came into the life of this little girl \u201cRin\u201d, due to their status in life and the gap between their ages, both of them are having a hard time expressing their feelings towards to each other. Being the older one, he must take the responsibility to understand the situation that she is currently experiencing. \r\nThe mainattraction would be the simplicity of enjoying life that turns to be extraordinary by being true to their selves. As the story goes, there are happy and sad moments, obstacles, and new encounters that gave me some second thought. Even though it was a bumpy ride for them, it always gave a perfect smile that it must not be over thought. It may be a simple storyline where daily task are done in an ordinary manner, but the way it flows, it became extraordinary when just giving it a smile and not over thinking it.\\n\\n\r\nEven if the story is just like that when the turn of events, the flow, and the right execution are made right it will make a great and nice story. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAll is great with art & animation. The shade of colors that is used in the background, characters, and scenery really matched well in the theme and as a slice of life story. Art in OP and ED are also beautiful and adds a plus to the series. Characters are drawn in a detailed manner, sharper and clearer. The way it animated where they show different emotions, faces and gestures brings additional feelings towards it which is also nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound\u2026\\n\\n\r\nIt has a happy OP song that makes a good start and a soft and tender ED song to end it on every episode. Even inside an episode there are times that sound will make you happy, though there are times it makes you sad. As a slice of life, sound effects can cast a valuable role where it brings out the emotions of characters, on what they really felt.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\u2026\\n\\n\r\nDaikichi is a caring, responsible, and neat guy who sees that everything will be fine while Rin is a caring, responsible, and adorable child who seeks somebody who will love her. Maintaining their relationship as a guardian and a child makes this anime interesting as they unfold their emotions towards each other. Also the greatness with it is the supporting characters that help them to achieve what they truly desire in life and reveal who truly they are.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment takes place by being who they are and what they imply in life. It is the reason that gives entertainment and a heartwarming feeling. Everything in the setting like the plot, the sounds & backgrounds, and the characters, if they are mixed all together, it ends with an awesome slice of life story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\u2026\\n\\n\r\nIt is a simple yet outstanding slice of life story. A refreshing anime to watch, a definitely must not missed anime. 9/10 overall\u2026 \\n",

            "content": "Usagi Drop is a anime that was air last season. The show is comprised of 11 episodes.\r\nThe show is about Kawachi Daikichi, Who is a 31 year old bachelor. Who ends up living with his 6 year old aunt. I bet from the summary your already beginning to think this is another lolicon show. But suprising as it is. It really isn't. Instead I would say if you are a fan of something like Clannad After story you would greatly appreciate this show.\r\nKawachi Daikichi after arriving back in his home town to attend his grand fathers funeral and wake, meets a unknown girl, who runsaway as soon as she see's him. He later discovers that the girl is his grand fathers illegitimate daughter. Due to certain reasons of no one wanting to look after her. He takes it upon him self to raise her.\\n\\n\r\nThe show really centres on the twos day to day life. Which is filled with funny and heart warming moments. Especially as Rin begins to open up to Daikichi more and more. Even the family that wanted to leave her to adoption services begin to accept her.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it really brings back some child hood memories for me. The different situations Daikichi goes through in order to raise the girl is realistic, and the sacrafices he makes for her in order to ensure she is not neglected makes you feel some respect for the guy. As the show goes on he meets more parents, and learns more about raising a child.\\n\\n\r\nHis family's traditions, the sacrafices his mum had to make. The sacrafices other parents make for their kids, really kinda make you think back to the days when you were a child who knew almost nothing.\\n\\n\r\nThough personally as an ageing bachelor myself, I feel a connection to Daikichi. Especially since with each day you feel a sense of nothingness in life, especially when you have nothing that you really want from money, or what you can buy with money.\\n\\n\r\nGenerally its a slice of life anime. But with alot of important points about modern to day life and parenting. Maybe some of the stuff doesn't apply to some countries. Maybe you can't relate. But this show made me feel all nostalgic and warm inside.\\n\\n\r\nThe art work is simple. and at the beginning for the opening scene, is usually coloured with water colours. giving it a very light yet heart warming feel. (I know I have used the words Heart warming a few times now).\\n\\n\r\nThe music in it suits the show, each note just feels like its directing your emotions for the characters. There are moments when that key piece of BGM just climaxes on the most touching scene of the episode, making you feel all fuzzy. (Really caught with the OST, Constantly found myself singing the High High High ending.)\\n\\n\r\nHowever the last episode did not really cover all the open points, so I assume that there will be a second season. Atleast that is what I am hoping for. (Going to read the manga in the mean time.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall its a show anyone can watch, old or young. I personally give it a 10/10 and its a show I can rewatch. Just because there are so many moments in there that I have enjoyed. The characters in there are all lovable.\\n\\n\r\nI know some people will have a different view on this, but this is from what I have gathered from watching the show and what I felt from it.\\n\\n\r\nAlso I have submitted this review in a Blog on GT as Phoenix313 (Old Tag, since my current one was blocked).",

            "content": "Usagi Drop is easily my favorite show of the year so far. Easily so, in fact. I\u2019ve enjoyed others, like Madoka, AnoHana, Steins;Gate and others, but this was a gem through and through. It just oozed smoothness and had an ease to it I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen in an anime. Some other kind of true to life shows I might compare it to would be the depressing, but ultimately rewarding, Welcome to the N.H.K and the stellar romantic-dramedy Nodame Cantabile. I\u2019ll try my best to identity some of the well-laid elements of the show.\r\nFirst and foremost, any reviewer would be doing a greatdisservice without first mentioning the characters of Usagi Drop. I would sum them in 2 words\u2013Complex & Simple. It may sound paradoxical, but that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re like. I\u2019d go as far as saying that that\u2019s what real people in the real world are like as well. There are good times and bad times, there are times in which we need help and there are times that we can offer our help to others. The series creators did a superb job showcasing the characters. Especially in fact, the female characters.\\n\\n\r\nThis makes a lot of sense due to the mangaka of Usagi Drop being the very female Yumi Unita. While Daikichi is a well-formed male lead and the other guys (Kouki included) are completely solid, it\u2019s the real women of Usagi who steal the show. Gotou, Daikichi\u2019s co-worker gets some props for being the first person he encounters who shoots straight about family and sacrifice. Haruko, (Daikichi\u2019s cousin) along with Masako and Yukari, show multiple facets of not only motherhood, but womanhood in general. Daikichi\u2019s sister and mother also provide some small pointed moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are pretty much a joy from start to finish. If I have one knock on the entire show, it\u2019s that there can\u2019t possibly ever have existed a child as sweet as Rin. But I rationalize it like this\u2013if there was a child that sweet, someone would have to turn them into a fictional character, which Rin is. It\u2019s circular logic, see?\\n\\n\r\nThe production of the show is 100% flawless. In fact, while mulling over the live-action Usagi Drop, I can\u2019t help but think the story will suffer from lack of animation. I can\u2019t imagine this story without Rin\u2019s happy face or Daikichi\u2019s what the hell face. The animation is memorable, which means a lot from me\u2013an anime fan not so impressed by, well, not much of anything really. It\u2019s very simple in its colorful pastel-like colors and always easy on the eyes. The opening of each episode, in particular with its water colored illustration style, was outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was fantastic. I\u2019m not an opening/ending kinda\u2019 guy and Usagi didn\u2019t particularly overwhelm me. The background music however, was flawless, and unlocked an entire other dimension to the animation.  I submit the following sound clip as evidence letter U, and to which I now can\u2019t listen without getting a little choked up.\\n\\n\r\nRin and Daikichi's theme.  [sound clip found on review url posted below]\\n\\n\r\nJust one of many musically magical pieces used throughout the series. Another aspect of the sound was the ever-present Ayu Matsuura, the 11 year-old seiyu who voices Rin. Hearing her voice was like goddamn sunshine throughout all the summer days. All the actors and actresses were solid and I can\u2019t honestly remember noticing any characters with strange sound qualities. I imagine, in my silly mind, all these adult roles being that which voice actors go nuts over. I don\u2019t know about you, but I love mature sounding people in anime. All the adults and all the kids were wonderful. Like in all aspects in Usagi Drop though, it\u2019s Rin and Daikichi who are the centerpieces.\\n\\n\r\nThat leaves me with just the plot, which was tight and once again, simple. The story is set up in the first episode. And the story never changes up or switches out. There aren\u2019t other stories introduced that take away from the original. There seemed to be two main type of episodes, with some slight variations. There were central story episodes\u2013He takes Rin home, finds out about her and later her mother and deals with being parent. And there were the \u201cDaikichi learns a lesson\u201d type of episodes, in which he sometimes imparted those lessons to Rin as well.\\n\\n\r\nThere were slight variations, such as the Haruko episode, in which Daikichi\u2019s resolve is bolstered, just from bearing witness to the struggles of another familiar parent. I\u2019ll fight the urge to detail any further character growth or subtle plot development. By sticking to the \u201cnon\u201d rating system we developed last season, I would go ahead and recommend this show to anything with a pulse. It easily makes my favorite list, and were we to make another \u201canime shows you\u2019d recommend to someone who doesn\u2019t watch anime\u201d list, this would have to be near the top.\\n\\n\r\nJust know that if you haven\u2019t seen this series, the people in it and some of the things they deal with, will be true to life. Not always mind-blowing and not always exciting, but always just right. Thanks Usagi Drop for making my summer a little better. Thanks also to anyone who may have followed these reviews or left comments!\\n\\n\r\nThis was originally posted on my blog found here -- http://moemonster.com/2011/09/16/usagi-drop-episode-11-finale/  I had also reviewed the finale, which has been edited out for spoiler purposes.",

            "content": "A beautiful thing that I finished. \r\nIt was a work of art that displayed a realistic and simplistic story filled with heartwarming moments and times of deep thought, thoughts of whether or not our current actions were correct, whether or not it truly was worth giving one's dedication to something more important than them. Life isn't a fairy tale. Things happen, and people endure. It's the simplest values, like family and presence, that stay true in the end. \r\nThe world in Usagi Drop is unremarkable. That is, the same kind of world many of us live in. We go through a routine that follows usfor the rest of our lives. We eat, we sleep, we work, we weep, and we love. Each episode gave us just another taste in the life of Daikichi, who willingly chose to take care of a child she barely knew. For him, it is a strange thing, suddenly being given responsibility over something worth more than one's self. How many other people would give up their leisure and free time for something like this? He partied, and he lived his own life. Then, he learns what it means to have something to work for, a semblance of what thinks a parent should do. \\n\\n\r\nThe entire story is an anthology of one year that Daikichi raises Rin Kaga. He watches her grow up, perhaps too fast. They go through life just as someone else would, by doing our daily duties and then coming home. \\n\\n\r\nLaugh, and the whole world laughs with you. Weep, and you weep alone. However, interactions between Rin and Daikichi show that they aren't alone. For Rin, who was shunned by her family, and Daikichi, who has lived by himself for a long time, they take comfort in each other. Usagi Drop displayed human emotion in its simplest form, that is, simply finding happiness for taking care of one another. The people around Daikichi have all had their own struggles, whether they be marriage or raising children. For him, it is an entirely new but thoughtful experience. Family is an important part of everyone's life, and Daickichi and Rin give form to this idea. It was heartwarming, and it was lovely to see them grow up and teach each other. \\n\\n\r\nArt and animation were incredible. It was like watching a water color painting come to life. It was colorful, detailed, and created Usagi Drop's ordinary life. The opening and ending themes gave the show a very upbeat and optimistic feel, something very appropriate to the story it tells. \\n\\n\r\nIt was a masterpiece, and an amazing experience. It was a story about growing up and looking at life in a simpler way. Not many slice-of-life's can compare to how well it told its story. It teaches us that parenthood/childhood is something to be cherished. \\n\\n\r\nSudden change can be overwhelming, but sometimes, it may not be all that bad. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "A very touching anime about how a Man raises his grandpa's daughter. Aka Aunt. Weird enough, it is portrayed in a very comedic and dramatic way, and gives a relaxing and serene mood and atmosphere as well whilst watching.\r\nMakes you feel like you are literally raising your own child.\r\nStory 10: developing relationships between a man and his grandpa's daughter. \r\nArt 10: Very unique and subjective, beautiful and serene. Relaxing as it is, it allows the message of the anime deliver well to its audience, rendering the audience stoned and making them understand how challenging and difficult it is to raise a child as economically,socially and timewise, it is very hard. \\n\r\nDespite the difficulties they come across to, they make it together.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8: The op and maybe 1 soundtrack was good.\\n\r\nCharacter 10: Has 2 main ones. Both developed into a good relationship, deep one. 2 deep 4 me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9: was hard to follow at times as I was not used to the art and the slow pacing but then the message was delivered into my head and made me enjoy it much better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9: Many lessons can be learnt from this anime. As well as to always remember to change diapers for your kid and dont be late from work to pick your son up.",

            "content": "I heard of this anime through a vague mentioning on tvtropes about spoilery events, most precisely the end(RIP). Despite that, I had to know how it managed to get to that in the first place.\r\nAlso to note, When I first read heard about it, I though Daikichi, one of the two most important characters, was younger than he actually was until I was immediately set straight.\r\nStory 9/10: The story itself is well paced, meaningful, and introduces very few characters as they are generally not important to the plot revolving around Daikichi, Rin, and their relationship. Unlike some other anime's that seem to name off everysingle individual regardless of whether they are *truly* important or not. The story starts with key points, and some well hidden key points that are integral to the plot post-anime in the manga. Only looking back now can I really piece things together like a conspiracy theorist and fully understand what the story was building up to and appreciate it more.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: Generally fluent and unique animation, with the pre-intro scenes done in a different style.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10: The sound fulfills its role. As a true slice-of-life anime there is hardly much to consider above average or sub-par as long as it is functional.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: Of the few characters that are introduced, only 2 of them make any real impact on the story. Kouki and his mother Yukari. Daikichi immediately has some attraction towards Yukari, but she keeps her distance for unrelated circumstances later revealed in the Manga, as the Anime stops at Volume 4 and the series continues far past that. Rin however sees Kouki as a nuisance because he is what the Japanese would refer to as a \"delinquent\" and generally a feeling of disrespect towards and emanating from him.\\n\\n\r\nMost other characters that have names fulfill roles equal to plot devices. Generally being unhelpful or pushing their own beliefs onto the main characters for whatever reason. That's it. In the post-anime Manga, that's literally all anyone but Daikichi and Rin are there for. Most of which think that Kouki and Rin are dating, much to Rin's utter dismay and reluctance as Kouki is disrespectful, pushy, and generally abhorrent... compared to her serious and composed nature. Kouki however wants exactly that, to be with Rin. \\n\\n\r\nPotential Spoiler: As a viewer who actually hated Kouki's the second he was introduced and hoped he got what he deserved at some point, I couldn't be happier with the ending and the events leading up to it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: I entered the series generally knowing the ending. The anime itself is rather enjoyable with very few parts being off-putting. Most of which involve Kouki and his utter reluctance to be likable in any way both in the Anime, and  especially in the Manga itself until the very end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: The anime series is definitely worth watching with it's heartwarming slice-of-life nature. The manga though that continues the story after a sudden 10-year timelaps is dramatically different and moreover significantly less appealing. All it does is pander to ship-teasing(character shipping wars) with more or less obvious results. It wasn't even enjoyable at that and I found myself utterly disgusted and skipping upwards of 10+ pages at a time at one point simply because of how forced and disrespectful Kouki is of other peoples feelings. So much so that the aforementioned plot-device characters take part in it and almost successfully force results with peer pressure.\\n\\n\r\nIn otherwords, the Anime is worth watching without a doubt. The manga though isn't worth reading as the quality itself is pretty sad in virtually all regards. All regards except possibly the \"build-up\" and justification for the ending results. You'd very well be better off just asking someone like me who has gone through and knows what happens without having to trouble yourself with very sub-par and generic manga that has terrible pacing.",

            "content": "There\u2019s a certain beauty in simplicity. There\u2019s something inspiring about capturing the raw form of something, stripping away the extraneous elements. Usagi Drop captures the essence of this beauty.\r\nThis is Production I.G\u2019s 11-episode depression medicine, Usagi Drop. It aired in the Summer 2011 season, and adapted the manga of the same name. But enough with the formalities - let\u2019s jump right in.\r\nUsagi Drop follows the life and bonding of Daikichi Kawachi and Rin Kaga. After Daikichi\u2019s grandfather passed away, he was visiting his mother\u2019s house for the funeral and was shocked to discover a shy young girl hiding from the crowd who he\u2019d never met- this girl, as the evidence suggested, was the daughter of his grandfather and a missing woman they did not know. This strange set of circumstances made it so that during the family discussion no one wanted to take her in. But Daikichi, who has been quietly observing Rin\u2019s kind and innocent nature decides to take her in despite his lack of knowledge regarding childcare. The story follows Daikichi as he learns to care for Rin and as their relationship grows.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop is in many ways a love letter to parenthood. It often expresses fascination with and appreciation for the effort and sacrifice parents give - especially single ones - but also acknowledges how in the end it\u2019s so very natural and worth it all for the parent. The love expressed in the series feels incredibly genuine, when we see how the variety of parents express their care for their children, even if it\u2019s only a brief appearance. The way they talk, the little gestures and facial expressions, all these further contribute to making the love feel real, especially in the case of Rin and Daikichi.\\n\\n\r\nThe familial bond that\u2019s formed between Rin and Daikichi is a very satisfying one to watch, and as you see them grow closer - you yourself start to feel closer to them as well. This show makes you pay attention to the little things in life. In Usagi Drop, those passing moments are the most important ones.\\n\r\nWhat I especially appreciate about Usagi Drop is it\u2019s wise use of speech or the lack thereof. A fairly common trope in anime and pretty much everything is that of a character expressing what\u2019s happening, what they are thinking, or how they feel aloud. While it certainly gets the job done, it hurts the believability of the show and the character because simply put, normal people don\u2019t act like that. Usagi Drop smartly avoids this. Conversations feel like conversations, never exposition or anything of the sort. It also benefits from allowing for those few quiet moments, having something told to the audience through facial expressions and gestures rather than through dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nIt helps that the animation is so well directed. It\u2019s not done so in the sense that there are many stand out scenes and moments of brilliance, but rather that it equally conveys everything it needs to in a satisfying and effective manner throughout the show. The character designs are cute and memorable, and the animation of the facial expressions - especially for the kids - is utterly adorable. On a technical level the animation is generally pretty consistent, barring occasional off moments. What\u2019s especially impressive is the use of color. The soft color choices are comforting to the eye and easy to watch, much unlike the widely popular unnecessarily high-contrast with bright coloration used in many other shows. Something of note is that in the beginning portions of each episode before the opening theme, the animation is colored with a very distinct watercolor style. It\u2019s quite beautiful and I imagine they likely wanted to use this throughout the show but the budget didn\u2019t allow for it. However, the short scenes of it we did get I\u2019m quite happy we did.\\n\\n\r\nThe series\u2019 soundtrack also supports the pervading theme of gentle simplicity. As you bond with the characters, an emotional bond is also formed with the tracks that accompany those moments. The songs vary from bubbly and rhythmic to mournful and sweeping. In the OST there is often the use of a repeating theme or even single note that continues throughout the whole piece. Generally the instrument choice is sparing, and the technical complexity is rather basic, but this style suits the straightforward honesty of the show well. The notes may not be brimming with intricacy, but they are wisely chosen. Each note has a sense of purpose and identity, and effectively provokes an emotional response, often aided in doing so by its accessibility.\\n\r\nUsagi Drop is short, sweet, and will win your heart over any day of the week.\\n\\n\r\nDue to it\u2019s length and design, it\u2019s very easy to watch, and makes for an incredibly enjoyable experience. It even is one of the few shows that makes good use of the life-goes-on ending. Often times this type of ending is used when the show has run out of episodes or caught up with it\u2019s source material, and comes off as frustrating and lazy. However, in Usagi Drop, it proves to be effective. The story isn\u2019t about a final conclusive point, there isn\u2019t really an end goal. The show is about watching relationships develop, enjoying the beauty of everyday life, which is why it\u2019s fairly inconclusive end is still quite satisfying. Granted, there were a few story arcs that ended up being left unresolved because of this, but ultimately they did not play a major enough role in the story to really be a problem. \\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop is wonderfully touching little anime that you\u2019ll remember long down the line for being just that. It hits all the right places, and just does everything well, to the point that it\u2019s hard to find any major faults. Memorable, adorable, and pretty darn phenomenal, Usagi Drop is a fantastic Slice of Life that doesn\u2019t need you to be a Moe fan to fall in love with it.\\n\\n\r\n(\ufeffOriginally Posted December 7th, 2015)\\n\\n\r\nhttps://writtenandwriting.wordpress.com/\\n",

            "content": "Anime Title: Usagi Drop\r\nProduction Studio: Production IG\r\nDirector: Kanta Kamei\r\nAir Date: Summer 2011\r\nEpisode Length: 11\r\nGenres: Slice of Life, Josei\r\nFamily is the key to happiness. And the anime that is the very definition of this phrase. And if you the reader one day dreams of becoming a parent one day, then I highly encourage you to watch this show before you do.\r\n==================================================================\r\n~Story 7/10~\r\nThe story of Usagi Drop is centered around the character Daikichi whose maternal grandfather passes away in the first episode. At the time Daikichi\u2019s grandfather was currently raising a little girl who goes by the name of Rin, who ended up shortly becoming an orphanand had nowhere to live\u2026 until Daikichi steps in and offers to become the legal guardian of Rin. You could say this was a huge commitment for Daikichi concerning the fact in which he was currently single and had never had any prior knowledge in how one might raise a child.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters and Their Interactions 10/10~\\n\r\nAs how I previously noted above, the two main characters in this anime go by the names of Daikichi and Rin.\\n\\n\r\nDaikichi is a thirty year old bachelor who is also a hard working businessman that struggles to balance both his time at work and his time to take care of Rin. Yes he is new to parenting, but he does try his hardest to give Rin as normal of a life as possible. Whether it be by taking Rin to a daycare or by leaving her at his mother\u2019s house, Daikichi somehow finds a way to have someone looking after Rin whenever he is at work. \\n\\n\r\nRin is a six year old girl whose origin is not very well known but is ultimately one of the sweetest characters that I have personally ever seen in an anime. She is in fact someone that I would gladly adopt if I had the chance. Rin is a child who is as happy as one could ever be, but at times throughout the show she ends up dealing with the pain of losing her former father figure. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe most important aspect that this show excels at the most is the realism in the characters. The characters do get nightmares, they do get wet dreams, yes they do get sick, and sometimes they goof around with one another. An example of this is when Rin is sitting on a tall chair or porch, you will always see her swinging those feet as fast as they can go. As for Daikichi you may end up seeing him stumbling around with his words whenever he is in an uncomfortable/nerve-racking situation, or you might see his hair messed up with a un-properly tied tie all because he was running late for work. The thing that makes Usagi Drop memorable to me is the incredible amount of attention to detail that is put into animating this series.\\n\\n\r\n~Music~\\n\r\nThe opening theme to Usagi Drop is a more upbeat and happy song, it is there to evoke a sense of joy into the viewer all while making it a song that is very oriented towards young children. The choice of using an child oriented song is quite ingenious because the show is all about how someone should raise a child. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the ending theme it is there to evoke a very nostalgic memory of the viewer\u2019s past. It is there to for the viewer to look back and notice how far the bond between Daikichi and Rin have progressed since the very beginning of the show, all while also making the viewer have the desire to come back and watch one more episode.\\n\\n\r\nFinally for the soundtrack, it is very slow and relaxing. Which suits the show very well since Usagi Drop is a slice of life series. The timing of each track is masterfully placed to the point where it not only matches the tone of the scene in which it is being used in, but it also elevates that scene into something even more memorable than it would have been without the track in the background. And if you were to ask me what my favorite track was, I would respond back saying how Wakare 2 is my favorite song from Usagi Drop\u2019s soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\n~Art/Animation 10/10~ \\n\r\nFirst thing that I have to say about the art is how it is visually stunning. For the first 5 or so minutes in each episode the artstyle of the show is very pastel looking; it is as if the show appeared to be a moving work of art. But as the episode progresses the artstyle slowly yet seamlessly morphs into a flatter texture while also being slightly more realistic in design. As for the animation of the show I can not notice any animation errors or choppiness, so it passes with flying colors in this category.\\n\\n\r\n~Final Thoughts~\\n\r\nI originally watched this anime by conducting a poll in an anime community that I was apart of, I added it to the list and was skeptical about it at first but to my surprise it ended up winning. So I stuck to my word and watched it shortly after and all I can say is that this show sucked me into the world and made me feel as if I was a part of this bizarre father/daughter type of relationship. I started the show at the beginning of the day and just continued watching it all the way until the final episode and it just flew by as if only five minutes had passed when in reality four hours passed by. And as I was writing this review I went back and rewatched the first episode just as a refresher but to my surprise about two hours later and I had re-watched half of the show all by accident. The ending of the show makes me compelled to ask for more, but what lies after the anime\u2019s ending is the highly controversial ending in of which creeps me out everytime I think of it. Even tho I was disgusted by the ending of the manga, that stilled didn\u2019t take away any of my joy that the anime gave to me. \\n\\n\r\nI am officially awarding this series with the rating of 9/10 and an enjoyability rating of 10/10. This show also currently remains in my Top 5 Favorite Anime that I have seen up until this point in time.\\n\\n\r\n~Similar Anime Recommendations~\\n\r\nBarakamon & Wolf Children\\n\\n\r\n~Upcoming Review~\\n\r\nStay tuned next week when I review Zankyou no Terror.",

The story isn't the greatest thing you have ever heard of but it's still definetly very entertaining and the story is very cute and heart warming.\r\nThe art is definetly noticeable and different from other serious. The art style is great but what I think makes the art stand out is the colours! The colours are what I think standout the most in the art as they are very bright and vibrant.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the anime series is really good, the music and the story go hand in hand. The music is upbeat and very joyful which also gives life to the anime series.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are amazing (especially cute little Rin) :D The characters are what make the show shine the most! The little characters in the show such as Rin and Kouki are the cutest things imaginable! These characters are the part of the show that make the show fun and jolly. The adults in the show such as Daikichi show the difficulties of parent hood and the joys of parent hood. There are a lot of characters and seeing them grow and develop is what's fun\\n\\n\r\nIf anyone comes up to me and asks, \"what anime series should I watch.\" I would say Usagi Drop! Why you ask? Because it's a great show and I reccomend everyone to watch and give it a shot just like I did :)",

            "content": "Usagi Drop was an anime that you can feel at ease with. You are watching a child grow up and go through events that you can probably relate to. For that, it deserves to be praised to be one of the best.\r\nI didn't felt a reason to complain in any episode because I just let the story solve itself, and it seemed to be great to watch the characters solve their own problems in a meaningful way. I will be talking about the story, art, and the characters. \r\nStory: The story mainly focuses on the 2 characters that you get to see grow up together,Daikichi, and Rin. There isn't much to talk about with the plot, because all the details you get is that they are living together and growing up. Can a great anime only have a complicated plot? Of course not, because in each episode they have a problem or an event that you get to watch, and it was fun, adorable, and sweet. I was amazed and happy in every episode because I enjoyed having the characters have a good time together and try to solve their own problems without me trying to voice my opinion upon it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art isn't at all stunning, but it felt clean. I thought it fit well of what was going on. The animation wasn't stunning either because it was just simple. Although in every episode in the beginning, the art style changes and it looks like a child drew the animations, and I thought it was cute to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters are what gets your attention. I was amazed that you could get to the characters so well in just two episodes, especially Daikichi and Rin. Daikichi is a adult who doesn't know anything how to raise a child, but he tries his best to figure a way to have Rin be happy. He is kind, he thinks about the people before him, he gets easily irritated by his family and kids, and he's a loving father without realizing it himself. Rin is a young girl who was born by Daikichi's grandfather from his mother's side. She does things in a child's matter, but she also has a mature side in her, from what you can gather, she got that side from her father. She is sweet, kind, she cares a lot for the people that she loves, and she is also a little bossy. There are more characters that would peak your interests, but the cherry on top are the two characters that you get to see every episode, being happy.\\n\\n\r\nNow this review doesn't really show the charm of the Anime, but I guarantee, if you want to watch a start of a new family, then this would be a blast for you. Usagi Drop receives a 8/10 on my part. This is a anime that I will won't forget.  \\n",

            "content": "Usagi Drop? You mean Usagi Dropped??? Well, I wont be able to use that lame joke.  Since I absolutely loved this anime. There are different kinds of anime, and we cant use a single method to see if they're good or bad. Some tell a story, and some is solely for enjoyment and to make you feel good. This is what Usagi Drop is all about. \r\nStory 10/10\r\nAs I have said, we can't really judge a slice of life for it's lack of story progression and so on, since it mirrors real life. The story is simply Rin and Daikichi's adventures(?) and everyday life.And that is more than enough to make me recommend this to everyone.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThough it certainly isn't impressive, let alone ground-breaking; Usagi Drop's art complements the anime very well, and makes immersion pretty easy. Daikichi's design isnt so bad, in fact, I like his art. Rin's funny faces are also definitely one of my favorites. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are good, but not much to write home about. The soundtracks in the anime itself though, are pretty decent and fits the mood as far as I can tell. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nNow this is where slice of life anime should really shine. It's characters must be likeable and if its a comedy, funny. Usagi Drop has of course, lived up to this requirement. The characters are all lovable, and I personally, have become attached to some. Although the anime is a slice of life, there has been significant character developments in the series. Rin faces alot of problems and have come to terms with them, and Daikichi works his problems of not knowing how to raise a child out. \\n\\n\r\nOverall and Enjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nAll in All, Usagi Drop is something I'll remember. Each episode felt like 5 minutes to me, and before I knew it, It was already over. Half the comments were about how the manga was horrible, but don't let these stop you from enjoying the anime. Seeing the characters interact happily, but still realistically is something I loved very much. If you want to sit back and just enjoy a chill anime, then you might want to try this out!",

            "content": "Usagi Drop is quite simply one of the most beautiful stories out there. If someone is reading this, please, never read anything about the manga, it will just ruin all the sweetness and purity from the blissful experience that the animated version of Usagi Drop is. \r\nStarting with the characters, they are all impressive, everyone is truly authentic to what a real person would be, behaving genuinely according to what you would expect from a father, a daughter, a mother, a friend and so on. This is very evident fromt the get going as the robotic bachelor Daikichi meets Rin, who has always lived apeculiar life and is forced to abandon everything that she ever knew. Usagi Drop shows how strong a bond can be forged by not only a father and a daughter, but also two human beings who truly empathize with each other from the moment they meet. It also shows how brutal and cynical some families can be when an unusual situation arises and how quickly the tides change when someone rises above the hypocrisy and opportunism of others. That's who Daikichi is and that's why he recognizes who Rin truly is - an innocent child who has lost everyone who was meant to love her. \\n\\n\r\nI believe Daikichi is a great protagonist, since the story isn't too centered on him, but you still can easily put yourself in his shoes while appreciating the hardships and lessons from parenthood. It felt really nostalgic watching some of these episodes. I don't believe many people know how hard it can be to raise a child, let alone as a single parent. Coming late to daycare, worried to death about a kid; feeling lonely in the daycare, because your parent is late from work or stuck in traffic; being worried to death because a child is sick; feeling so bad that your only comfort is the unconditional support from those who love you - this is real life, this is as close as a parent-child relationship gets. Usagi Drop does this masterfully, using the anime setting to the fullest, sparring us from the artificialism of movies and TV series that more often than not force reactions, drama and sensationalism out of actors. Usagi Drop presents us with a suitable and distinguishable cast of characters, who are well voiced, which is a prominent advantage that Japanese animation has over other media. In other words, overall, Usagi Drop made me feel that it was a story best told through anime, which is a very good sign. \\n\\n\r\nI would watch both Daikichi and Rin grow up as parent and child for many more episodes, which is a testament to how well-executed a very short episodic anime can be. Every moment was blissful, entertaining, cute, moralizing, insightful, lovely, intimate... Many, many, positive adjectives could be added. It is pretty crazy how much happens in just 11 episodes and how much you can learn and sympathize from it, especially if you are familiarized with a single parent setting. A shoutout also needs to be made to Kouki and his mom, as they are also fully fleshed characters, who constantly motivate feelings of community and selflessness, while regularly providing the show diversity, aswell as opportunities to convey more meaningful messages to the overall show.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also worth talking about. With a solid ending and an opening that is a peculiar throwback to The Clash - I Fought The Law, a song that has these verses:\\n\\n\r\n\"I left my baby and it feels so bad\\n\r\nGuess my race is run\\n\r\nShe's the best girl that I ever had\\n\r\nI fought the law and the law won\\n\r\nI fought the law and the\" \\n\\n\r\nSomething, something, I think not. Anyhow the rest of the soundtrack is really good, stands on its own and really gives more emphasis to what's going on.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion the biggest setbacks from this show is its short length (which is not objectively bad at all) and a lack of a better disclosure. Usagi Drop has been one of the most enjoyable shows I've watched and I would recommend it to anyone who knows what it is about and who knows what to expect from it. I would also recommend that you would watch the Usagi Drop Specials, since these less than 5 minute episodes really feel like part of the journey and sometimes end up polishing certain episodes. Perhaps, it is not the anime that will leave you mindblown or push itself to the limits, but that's part of the reason why I felt it was a great experience - it doesn't need to do either of those things to provide you with truly positive content.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack - 8.5\\n\r\nAnimation - 8\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\r\nCharacters - 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10",

I will explain what I thought of each expect of the show.\r\nAlso pardon me if I get small details wrong like age etc, The review will stand for what I say even if I get a small detail wrong, I am going by what I personally thought.\r\nStory\r\nSo what happens when you're grandfather has a kid and he passes away? Well normally they're a little older and matured, but inthis case his child is only 6 and no one wants to take her. Fortunately his grandson, or her uncle decides that if no one else would do it, he would. Anyway in short the story revolves around there new found life together and how the manage to survive, and in all it is a very heart warming anime that anyone could sit back and relax while watching. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art is perfect to go with this anime, it gives off a childlike feel. I am going to assume that is what they wanted and so nothing else to say, the art was perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nNow the sound to the story was as if again like the art, had a childlike feel, and so nothing more to say it was perfect, it went with the story as best as it could.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe whole story was around the development of Rin and Daikichi. The development was paced perfect. there was something new every episode and it is not like you can put a load of fan service in a series like this, so again perfect.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series to its fullest. It was a perfect anime and a much watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\r\nIt was a perfect anime. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nP.s sorry for the bad review, but I don't know what to say after watching it so long again, when I think back to the anime I can only think perfect! anyway give the anime a shot I say.",

            "content": "An exemplary case of how a minor work can actually be a major work. Minor in the sense of the scope of the story, of course: there's barely any confrontation; the hardest emotions are probably those arising from the preoccupation with not doing enough, or not knowing how to deal with a cold. But japanese culture is very much about amplifying the minor into revealing the major: there's something very Ozu-ish about the (Tokyo) Story here, from the egotistical family discussing how to pass on a bothersome family member, to the greatest epiphany being a character sudden discovery of its empathy.\r\nAt the beginning of theepisodes there's a little scene, often loose from the arc of the episode, that is animated differently, like we're accessing the past in a snippet of quotidian nostalgia, as if those are the moments we -- maybe mysteriously -- will forever remember: a certain look on your kid's face, or her best friend pulling a teeth in the supermarket. And the whole anime is very mysterious: why does Daikichi takes the kid in? Where does this comes from? I don't think is particularly clear, but at the end this question kind of does get answered: life is about having pleasure in others, and how this pleasure can be as intense as the one we have only for ourselves. Our plans don't really matter, life also just kind of happens to us. And we can choose to be open to it.\\n\\n\r\nLoose thoughts:\\n\\n\r\n- My chest got so FULL during this, I felt like hugging and kissing my children. My cat ended up suffering this fate.\\n\\n\r\n- There's an enormous generosity to the characters here. Even those who would often get judged by their actions are kindly forgiven, as the anime is very clear that their lives are also difficult in their own way, from the glimpses we get into it.\\n\\n\r\n- Rin's character should be persecuted as the most blatant propaganda for children ever! I think Kouki's character is there solely to discourage people, \"think twice, you may get a Kouki instead of a Rin...\"\\n\\n\r\n- Where's the rest of this fucking anime, I need news on these characters as they get older! Does Rin turns into a mangaka? Do Daikichi and Yukari get together? Do Rin and Kouki end up a couple?? So much to know!!",

            "content": "Story\r\nStraightforward story, with no unnecessary complications; it is easy to follow. It is not a particularly thought provoking anime, nor does it try to be one, but it quite succinctly, and satisfyingly explores the subject of parenthood. There is an overarching plot, but that gives way to a more episodic sort of structure, with plot pieces being discovered along the way. This honestly works in favor of the show, making it easy to follow, and easy to consume.\r\nArt\r\nThe art style is definitely unlike other anime I have seen. The episodes begin with a short intro with frames like a watercolor/marker image. The rest of theepisode will use more typical style. Though the style is not particularly detailed or realistic, the designs of the characters are simple and realistic.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nBackground music was fitting, but nothing was particularly memorable. No complaints. I didn't find the OP/ED songs to be spectacular either. I did enjoy the voice acting on each of the characters though, as they were, how shall I say.. normal? With the realistic setting having the characters speak without the great exaggeration that many animes use, the voicing was pretty grounded and realistic, and each character was voiced by a fitting voice actor.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe characters are realistic, belonging to a realistic setting, and they do change over the season, as one can expect about an anime about a transition from one lifestyle to another.\\n\r\nRin in particular makes the whole anime work as, even though she is not the character we follow, she is the character that most of the anime revolves around. If you're worried about disliking an anime about taking care of a child, Rin will ease that immediately, as she is consistently super cute, intelligent, and well-behaved.\\n\r\nAs the anime follows Daikichi as he is thrust into the new world of parenthood, he is very relatable, which is good because there are many (not too much) instances where we hear his inner monologue. Really it is his development and interactions with new characters that keeps the show at a good pace.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI found this anime extremely easy to consume. While I imagine this may not be the case for everyone, I had no reservations about the show being about a new parent. It was a simple, peaceful kind of enjoyable, and I enjoyed it so much so that I would recommend it to just about anyone.",

            "content": "As a person who usually doesn't watch slice of life though there are good slice of life anime out there, they kinda seemed to die in story because the story doesn't progress towards a final goal, Usagi Drop is a slice of life that doesn't make you feel boring at all, in  my perspective. The story is amazing, I do really prefer these types of anime that has more of realistic side to it, I do love fantasy anime but this is just something I can't really explain. I personally loved how the characters developme in the anime, and the music how it allblends together to create this masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nStory \\n\r\nThis ain't no fantasy anime like re zero, the story it self is very simple, nothing crazy going on but the way the anime presents it self is crazy, a man taking care of his grandfathers child , who would thought of that? , the story ain't mainstream at all, its nothing but a collective events of a man and a girl living together, facing what ever that comes their way. The story it self is really beautiful, nothing mind blowing happens but it still keeps you wanting to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nNot an anime with great graphics, I might call it average on the art side and the animation\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nSound effects won't be much of a focus in the anime since there aren't any action or anything weird happening just a regular slice of life anime but the music was awesome. The opening song and the ending songs (Sweet drops and High high high) were awesome, I never skipped them, it suits the anime really well. Even the background music played from time to time were really beautiful, you will surely take note of it while watching the anime and will have a huge effect on how you feel while watching.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Design. \\n\r\nGraphically characters are not that attractive, but it definitely had depth in personality. I really liked how Daikichi adopted him self after bringing in Rin Chan, It was one of the splendid part of the anime, even Rin Chan adopting to Daikichi was really beautiful. You can see Rin Chan displaying few characteristics of her mother on the go, but she is very different from her mother, Rin is more lively I would say. Characters are very relatable if you put your self in their situations are see, which I did frequently.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up,\\n\r\nThere is nothing special in the anime, just a regular story, normal characters, normal backgrounds, but the way this series makes you feel is beyond normal. I'm not telling you this will keep you at the edge of your seat but instead this is more of a engaging series to watch, It makes you feel happy about how the characters interact with each other to make things happen the way they are supposed to. Personally I really enjoyed this, you probably won't, it depends on personal taste but this is something you must watch if you are taking a break from all those sci-fi fantasy romance anime.",

I suggest anyone who wants a serious and meaningful story to check this out because I'm already tempted to give this a 10 just for the first episode.\r\nStory: It's not all that complicated really... it's just as the summary says and nothing extra. But without a complicated story, its about the execution... and for a first episode... they pulled it off with flying colours.\r\nArt: Very unique, but it works. It's different and \"sketchy\", I don't know how it works, but I like it. It's prettymuch what you see in the display picture for the anime that MAL has up. \\n\\n\r\nSound: They know when to put music in the perfect places. In the first episode, compared to other anime.. not much words were being said. It was the background music that kept my attention for those moments of silence.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: OMG an anime that doesn't consist of teenagers or school kids. Wow. Amazing huh?\\n\r\nI already noticed Daikichi's unique thinking (intelligent if you may) right after he had a dream. He followed up with continuous thought of the dream. In any other anime he would've went \"oh well\" like an oblivious idiot like in most other anime.\\n\r\nRin's character is strongly shown through the comparison of the other girl, Reina. While Reina is loud and childish, Rin is mature and quiet. There even comes to a point where a comparison is shown. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Loved the first episode, can't wait for more, seems very interesting. Need I say more?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you're looking for a shounen, what on earth are you reading this for? go watch Sacred Seven or the second season of Nurarihyon no Mago. If you're looking for something that makes your heart all warm in an unexplained way and just simple, laid back, but meaningful, you've come to the right place.\\n\\n\r\nSince I have to select an Overall score, I'll make it 9. Since it would be cheesy to give anything a 10 for the first episode. \\n",

Following a 30-year-old man and a small cousin whom he has adopted recently without any childcare experience, this anime is a heartwarming story about affection, kindness and family, an anime about responsability and sacrifice, an story about two characters who raise and improve together. It has an unique vission of parenthood in the medium, and also realistic.\r\nTalking about the story itself, the pacing is slow, but it must to be slow, because real life is slow, and only in this way we can feel the progress of Daikichi and Rin asa family. It's simple and realistic, and probably the best slice-of-life anime out there in terms of realism, I've missed some drama like Clannad After Story for example, but Usagi has its own way to be heartwarming, which is Kaga Rin CUTENESS OVERLOAD.\\n\r\nThe character are probably the best part of the show. Daikichi is the perfect example of sacrifice and maturity, helping Rin with her insecurities like the best father in existence. But remember, he's not the father, Daikichi must remain as Daikichi.\\n\r\nSecondary characters are import too, especially Rin's friend, Kouki, who has many things in common with Daikichi, giving us many scenes dad-son-like.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the art and sound so bad, first minutes of each episode in watercolor are just beautiful. Cute OP and ED, and the general animation is rather superb, especially how it show the emotions of the character (Especially Rin, that I-can't-be-happier smile is genius, similar to the manga)\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack suits very well, some amazing piano and guitar pieces, fitting the pacing very well.\\n\\n\r\nI'm proud and glad to say that i enyoyed this series a lot. I'm not a big fan of slice-of-life and their pacing, but it is sure that this one is a must watch, unlike the manga (vol.5 onwards) that I reviewed too.\\n\\n\r\n\"Do you recomend this anime?\" Hell yes. Go watch immediately. You'll not regret.\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Usagi Drop, take a look to:\\n\r\n- Clannad: After Story, my favorite anime series that have many things in common with Usagi Drop.\\n\r\n- Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki (Wolf Children), a pretty beautiful film that also involves family with good character developing.",

I very seldom give such a high rating, but do so now because Usagi Drop goes far beyond its peers, regardless of genre. Sit back and enjoy a truly mature anime and its beautiful portrayal of life. Also, remember that each episode has a scene after the ending credits.\r\nStory [8/10]: Being a slice-of-life anime, Usagi Drop doesn't have a goal-oriented plot. It is a story about a man and his newly adopted daughter Rin over the course of half a year. Although this was portrayed to perfection, Ideducted points for not completing the romantic subplot.\\n\\n\r\nPacing [10/10]: Every episode of Usagi Drop is filled with such care that there is no dull moment. Quite apart from having constant action, this is accomplished with the subtly crafted interactions which speak volumes towards character development. \\n\\n\r\nArt [9/10]: Just as the show is about a dull and colorless life being filled with the adoption of a child, each episode begins in faded watercolor and fills into a more standard anime palette. The artwork itself is excellent, and furthers a major motif: the quiet beauty of the everyday.\\n\\n\r\nSound [9/10]: The mellifluous soundtrack which accompanies Usagi Drop is a pleasure to listen to by itself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [10/10]: As expected from the genre, the characters and their relationships make the show what it is. They are all developed into full personalities and given a chance to develop over the series, even the minor characters, and everyone is realistic and lovely.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [10/10]: I enjoyed every bit of Usagi Drop, and hope that future shows can strive for this level of sophistication. This is a must-see!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: [9.5/10]",

The situation that leads Daikichi to meet Rin was peculiar enough to grab my attention. Strange situations like that hold a lot of potential.\r\nThere is so much commentary to unpack here. The show addresses everything from adults who reject their responsibilities, to adults who put their own dreams on the back burner for their kids. There really are no good guys and bad guys in this one. Just people.\r\nAt it's core, it is a story about a little girl who, despite being mature forher age and well behaved, is abandoned by everyone through life or death. And it's about a single man who is so moved by what she has endured that he takes up his cross learns what it means to be a parent. \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those rare cases where the show beats the manga for me.",

I'm sure it'll turn out alright.\r\nLots of things could be said. I think I'll go with spectacular personally. The story is actually amazing. It has the potential to go in a very dark direction given how things start. This has been one of the most \"adult\" Slice of Life shows I've ever seen and with good reason. The subject matter is very sensitive to be blunt.\r\nThe pastel art style that was chosen was also a deviation from what we typically see. It mayjust be me, but I think they might have done that on purpose given the theme. Pastels usually being simple, smooth, less stand out types of colors, which is the polar opposite to how complex and rough the plot starts out. It was a nice change of pace for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe show itself is very heart-warming. Rin is an adorable kid who really is very mature for her age. The little kid does come out of her here and there though. I believe that Daikichi \"grew\" the most despite him being around 30 at the shows start. He definitely didn't have to do what he chose to do and he never made any real excuses for all the hardships he had to face which is extremely admirable. I think while it was sort of subtle Yukari and Kouki played really nice supporting roles to each respectively. The fact that they were the reverse of Daikichi and Rin made the pairs \"connect the dots\" really well if you ask me. I kinda wanna say a little something about Masako but I don't really know what to say without really giving spoilers. Ironically I think that's actually the best way I can say it. She's there but not. You'll know exactly what I mean if you watch.\\n\\n\r\nI don't say \"never\" very often at all but I'll say this... I never expected anything like this in the Anime world when I first started really watching over ten years ago. Re-watching again recently I can say this much... I can see a similar Manga being published but I haven't seen and I don't think there will ever be something quite like this making it to TV again. I'm glad I stumbled upon it.",

            "content": "Well, after hearing so many good things about this new series, I decided to opt in and watch it! Oddly, after starting yesterday, I'm already up to episode eight. ^_^\r\nOf course, the title did confuse me a bit, and it still kind of does. \"Usagi Drop? So, Rabbit Drop, then? Wonder what this is about...\" \r\nStory: Now, the first episode is what hooked me--an illegitimate six year old child of a now deceased seventy-nine year old man left without a mother and a home? And then there's the main character Daikichi, a single businessman who decides to take in this child to keep her frombeing left behind again. After reaching episode eight and discovering certain secrets behind little Rin's past, I must admit, the story is quite captivating! I give the story a nine, and can't wait to see how this story will continue to unfold!\\n\\n\r\nArt: ...The art could be a bit better character-wise, BUT... ^_^ They did give us adorable children characters like Rin and Kouki. However, the scenary is well drawn-out and it's different. I'd give the art a seven.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice acting is well done. Voice actors like Kana Ueda, who voiced Haruko, Daikichi's cousin, and Hiroshi Tsuchida who voiced Daikichi were among some of these seiyuus. I was completely surprised to find that Rin's voice actress, Ayu Matsuura is only ten years old voicing a six year old character, which made the work all the more believable! I give the sound a ten!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  I'm quite satisfied with Daikichi's character development as well as Rin's back-story as she grows and matures while living with Daikichi. This story is allowing them to both grow together and to become more... open with one another. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I was quite hooked from the start, and each episode tended to make me go \"AWWW\" because of the multiple cute-fest moments, as well as watching Rin grow attached... ^_^ And in addition, the story is much better than I had anticipated. I give the enjoyment a nine.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I rate this a nine, for now until the story unfolds more. If you enjoy stories of \"finding a place in the world\" or even just interesting tales and secrets, then Usagi Drop is the show for you!",

            "content": "This anime is mostly based on story content, and neglects most of the other features that make the animation stand alone in quality.  The story is great, and truly highlights the slice of life genre more so than all the harem centered stories.  While believable, and more focused on a family setting, it doesn't lack the attention-grabbing effect that is so commonly related to the \"average guy gets lots of fangirls\" genre.  I'm not going to give you numbers or a synopsis, you can read that elsewhere.  \r\nThe art isn't the greatest, but you could tell that by the picture adorningthe summary.  The anime has no scenes where action would be a hindrance to production quality; the majority of it is just based on the relationship and daily lives between Daikichi, Rin, and the rest of his family, co-workers, and friends.  You should understand that this anime was based off of a josei manga and was probably produced just for those who had no intention of reading it.  It is probably for this reason that the quality is not the best.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was unremarkable.  The OP and ED didn't have any lasting effect and were much like the art quality.  However, the voice actors were superb at their respective roles.  The face mechanics really fit well with their real life counterparts expressions and tones.  Realism really shined through with the dialects and word usage which usually plagues the plot progression in anime with simplistic designs.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were akin to the common Japanese man or woman.  There weren't any goofy looking people with green and blue hair walking around shouting about how they rule the world.  The struggle of the working class at middle age was portrayed quite well.  Though Rin talks very little, her character shines through with facial expression and well placed silence.  One of the big factors that keeps you coming back throughout each episode is the hope that the parental relationship between Daikichi and Rin will work out.  \\n\\n\r\nIf you like slow-paced, down to earth, and realistic anime, you should give this a watch.  If you don't like this sort of genre, still give it a watch.  It could very well change your view of the care and consideration that is put into the stories in anime.",

This anime is a breath of fresh air bringing us a new and heart warming story which is unlike anything released this year. Visually Usagi Drop is well animated and has great character designs but overall it's nothing ground breaking and it doesn't need to be. It's a mostly story ran series that uses simple but beautiful scenes tohelp portray different emotions depending on the situation. Watching the first episode I was reminded of Karuho Shiina's Kimi ni Todoke, with it's visuals, loveable characters and suspenseful scenes which leave you gritting your teeth with anticipation over the smallest acts or decisions e.g the suspense between Sawako and Kazahaya for the whole series of Kimi ni Todoke which kept me watching the series for nearly 2 years. In no way am I saying this is a carbon copy of Kimi ni Todoke. Usagi Drop has a very original story line which touches on some hard topics while keeping it funny and light hearted without removing the drama aspect of the series. I look forward to future episodes and I have high hopes for Usagi Drop.     \\n\\n\r\nRough review by Charles Shepherd\\n\r\nwww.electricbloomwebzine.blogspot.com",

            "content": "Series with lighter moods and simplicity have risen in popularity within anime in the last few years. While the late 90s wave rode on the popularity of action, cool protagonists and lively soundtracks, things have become rather sedate in recent times. Which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing \u2013 quieter series have their place within anime and can heal the soul from the perils of modern life. Although there\u2019s a fair case that things have perhaps gone too far from one extreme to another. Moe and slice-of-life series are numerous these days and while they are quite fulfilling if given good production quality, a good voicecast, solid characters and a fulfilling story, there\u2019s a glut of titles that have been stripped back of anything negative to the point it feels rather bland. Last time I checked, life encompassed that which was bad as well as that which was good. But what can one expect when K-ON!\u2019s gargantuan sales have set the bar for how to sell a series in the current anime environment, particularly for more than one season, to the point it thrives long-term with merchandise value to boot.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, over the last six years there have been a few titles that haven\u2019t been over-simplified or refined into a smooth sugar-coated pill for the masses to consume without any fear whatsoever. Titles that remembered that it is possible to give a story that warms the heart and revolve around cute, charming young girls while having tension and seeing said characters go through the harsher side of life as well as the gentler side, yet take it in their stride. Anime doesn\u2019t always have to be made easy and frills-free to be a good watch \u2013 something I think that has been forgotten in the last five years as moe series have been more prevalent in sales.\\n\\n\\n\r\nBunny Drop (called Usagi Drop in Japan) is a title that doesn\u2019t take the easy path. Originally a nine volume josei manga series \u2013 recently concluded - written and drawn by Yumi Unita, a mother of two in her 30s, the manga-ka\u2019s intent was to detail what it was like for males to raise children. The story\u2019s premise is an intriguing one. 30 year old male lead Daikichi Kawachi is at his parents\u2019 home to attend the funeral of his recently deceased grandfather. While there, he meets Rin \u2013 a 6 year old girl who is quite unlike other children her age. She\u2019s somewhat quiet, well-behaved and quite aware of what\u2019s going on around her. Then comes the bombshell to rock the family \u2013 Rin is the illegitimate daughter of the deceased grandfather. Tensions flare as the family fails to agree on how to handle this and who should take custody of Rin. Disgusted by the slandering of Rin and her imminent fate of foster care, Daikichi spontaneously decides to take care of Rin. And thus the oddball pairing begins \u2013 30 year old bachelor who\u2019s hardly in adult mode yet and a 6 year old girl who\u2019s mature beyond her years and so well behaved it\u2019s spellbinding. Over the following episodes, the two adjust to having each other in their lives and to becoming better people, while the rest of the cast is gradually won over by Rin.\\n\\n\r\nNo surprise that the anime adaption aired within the noitaminA time slot on Japanese TV \u2013 this is a show that will mainly appeal to adults. And it\u2019s also not that surprising that Production I.G. took this title on \u2013 they have shown they are capable of making good adaptations of manga/novels with more serious/non-typical material in recent times. Sadly, they have not been big sellers for the greater part \u2013 Toshokan Sensou (Library Wars) was the only notable seller. (10k sales per volume. 5k+ per volume for a TV series with an average budget is required to return a profit according to the Manabi Line model.)\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the ingredients for a \u2018good\u2019 series are all here. The wispy lines and pastel colours style of the source manga are faithfully carried on to the anime version. This style can be hit-and-miss generally but it suits the mood and vibe of this series very well, giving it a warm, organic touch \u2013 kudos to Yuu Yashimata for getting this right, because comparing a volume of the manga to what is in the anime \u2013 they\u2019re almost identical. Director Kamei Kanta  and series composer Taku Kishimoto are to be commended for getting the pacing right for a title that was clearly only getting a budget for one season. noitaminA\u2019s tendency for 11 episodes per season has sometimes made for headaches regarding whether a series had proper story development from start to finish, but Kanta picks his timepoints from the source manga well, resulting in a story that flows throughout and ends at a point where one feels they have been given what they wanted to see. (Note \u2013 The source manga was split about halfway with a timeskip from Rin\u2019s young childhood to her teen years. This adaptation solely covers Rin\u2019s younger arc.) The character cast is very solid. Rin is a delight and has a charm and magnetism that just makes her instantly likeable. Ayu Matsuura gets her seiyuu debut voicing Rin but is a perfect match for the role, able to switch from Rin\u2019s innocent, snappy and mature modes with ease. Hirochi Tsuchida\u2019s previous roles are mainly shounen yet he does a good job with Daikichi, conveying his awkward, continual worrying yet generally responsible nature accurately. 90s seiyuu legend Maaya Sakamoto (The Major in the Ghost in the Shell movie, Hitomi in Escaflowne) makes a cameo as Masako, Rin\u2019s mother, but has great impact voicing the most oddball character in the show. Kana Ueda (Rin in Fate/Stay Night, Hayate in the Nanoha series, Yumi in Maria Who Watches Over Us) shows depth in her tonalities by voicing Haruko, one of Daikichi\u2019s sisters, who is a source of advice for Daikichi as he struggles through the earlier episodes. Suguru Matsutani\u2019s (Nodame Contabile) musical score is a pleasant compliment to the visuals, with a focus on providing a soothing enhancement to a scene\u2019s mood rather than being the focus of the scene. PUFFY and kasarinchu provide appropriate opening and ending theme songs, with the former doing cameo voices in Episode 9.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s important to keep in mind that this title will not be for everyone. There are no explosions, there is no fanservice, there is no SPAM of anime clich\u00e9s/character styles found in the more popular series. Nor does this series ever claim to be anything spectacular. It doesn\u2019t need to. Rin and Daikichi make such a great oddball duo that will provide plenty of moments to smile and feel warm on the inside. But it does also provide some flipsides to remind the viewer that while there are feel-good times to be had, raising a child is no picnic. It is a very time-consuming role that heavily compromises one\u2019s lifestyle and will permanently impact how you live, what you can do and when. There will be agonising moments. One of my favourite moments of the show was the episode where Haruko, Daikichi\u2019s older sister, has a breakdown when she falls into despair with how her life has turned out since she became a mother. Her eventual resolution is somewhat shocking yet very admirable and typifies the sacrifice and resilience needed to be a responsible parent. Masako is a character that will polarise people. You almost wonder whether her brain is sometimes on the dark side of the moon, but it becomes clear that she is a career woman and knows she can\u2019t be a responsible mother to Rin. Gotou-san provides a sobering example of a person who willingly gave up her own personal ambitions to focus on her family. The mother of Kouki \u2013 the boy who Rin is friends with during their early years \u2013 is a good example of a single mother toughing it out against the odds and finding a way to provide a decent life for her son. Now nothing is spectacular about these people, per se. But all in their own way, despite their shortcomings and humble natures, they are people that are remarkable in their own way. They do what is needed to cope with life, to get through a day and do what is needed for the benefit of others. There is tension, heartbreak and worrying. Because those are integral parts of life. It\u2019s a good thing those things are present and I\u2019m damn grateful for that because while a lot of recent series are so sheltered like a bubble and stripped of negativity to the point of oblivion, Bunny Drop doesn\u2019t shy away from them. It utilises those aspects to make its characters that much more likeable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I quite enjoyed this series. I\u2019m normally not one to like kids, but Rin is such a delightful character it\u2019s impossible to hate her. While I occasionally felt things were a bit too light or slow, I didn\u2019t feel that to be much of a hindrance. Raising a child isn\u2019t action central or drama laden. It\u2019s testing and a long-term commitment, but a fulfilling one in more cases than not. In the final episode, Daikichi reflects on how his life is now and wonders if the fact his whole life now centres around Rin and the things he used to do are no longer doable is a bad thing. As Kouki\u2019s mother tells him, isn\u2019t that enough to get through a day? The act of raising a child is meant to be its own reward and fulfilment. Bunny Drop is an accurate, heart-warming portrayal of what it means and entails to raising a child. It\u2019s refreshing to see a title avoid taking the easy way out and not follow the crowd blindly. Bunny Drop won\u2019t be topping the sales charts, but it is a feel-good series that nourishes the soul and doesn\u2019t leave you with diabetic symptoms after viewing. Simply put, this is the best series I\u2019ve seen from the three seasons of 2011 anime thus far.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Score \u2013 8.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nGeneral Score \u2013 8-9/10 for those who like this kind of series.\\n\\n\r\nEssential viewing for: Those who like their \u2018Awww!\u2019/soul-food moments with the lumps included.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t watch if \u2013 You can\u2019t live without your mechs or moe.",

            "content": "In most animes the focus is usually on a teenager, or a group of teenagers, where the parents and adults are side characters or even pushed completely into the background. Usagi Drop on the other hand focuses on something we see rarely in anime; the relationship between a foster parent and daughter. This leads to the question most people would be wondering before watching this show; can an anime be entertaining while only focussing on a relationship between a father and daughter? The answer is; absolutely.\r\nUsagi Drop is fairly unconventional in it's method of storytelling, but this is perhaps what makes the show great. Insteadof having a story arc with a climax, this anime has opted to be more realistic. The whole story is simply the first year Daikichi and Rin spend together. Each episode focuses on a different event during that year that you would expect to happen in a 6 year old's life, for example Rin's first tooth coming out. \\n\\n\r\nNow, all that I've mentioned so far is what makes Usagi Drop unique, but you must be thinking, what makes it entertaining? To begin with, Rin. She is an adorable, smart, funny and caring child. The events that happen to her are events that one may have experienced in one's own childhoods, making it easy to relate and empathise with her. Then there's Daikichi. Unlike Rin who appears to be the perfect child, Daikichi is a fairly typical 30 year old single male. He himself isn't entertaining on his own, but his interactions with Rin make for some awesome comedy and touching moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe best aspect of Usagi Drop is the development of Daikichi and Rin's relationship. This is perhaps one of the most genuine relationships I've seen in television. While Daikichi is not ready to warm to Rin at first, it is easy to see why he does. The pacing is done perfectly to respect their relationship. There are no jumps or sudden changes; everything is gradual as we see the pair learn to depend on each other. All aspects of their relationship are portrayed too, from the hardships to the triumphs. It is simply wonderful to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style isn't very unique, but it fits well. Characters look quite reallistic, fitting in with the theme of the show. What was impressive though were the ways they portray Rin's different emotions to emphasise her youth. It's worth noting that there's no fan service too.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is great and does it's job emphasizing the emotions behind each scene. Especially during the lighthearted moments where the music makes you want to smile and laugh. What is most memorable about the show's sound department is Ayu Matsuura's role voicing Rin. She does a fantastic job and I have no doubt anyone who watches this show will always remember her yelling \"DAIKICHIII\".\\n\\n\r\nWhile I have spent most of this review praising this show, there is one downside; the show ends too early. Now, that does not mean that I would want it to go down the path of the manga, but it would be nice to have a bit more exploration of Rin's real mother and then to perhaps tie up some of the other loose ends. Nevertheless, Usagi Drop manages to cover a lot of material within the few episodes that it has.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was ever an anime to watch when you're down and need cheering up, this is it. Usagi Drop is an incredibly charming and realistic look at the difficulties and happiness that comes with raising a child. It's enjoyable from start to finish and I would recommend everyone to at least give it a go. It's almost guaranteed to make you smile.",

            "content": "Story and Character Development\r\nThrough 4 episodes we are already seeing some great character and story development. Diaichi has seen his rather boring life turn into something more worth while. He has so far sacrificed his time with his friends and coworkers, he's trying his best to learn about raising a child and even has gone as far to request a transfer to an easier going job in order to raise Rin properly. He's even convinced some of his family members to be more accepting of Rin, but still they hold some reservations as to whether Diaichi can raise a child or not; prompting them toquestion him whether he is really going to raise Rin or not. Diaichi himself seems to also question himself wondering if contacting his maternal mother would be best for Rin and probably him. Rin's development has been a bit more slower, though she has made friends and is learning \"fast\" as Diaichi soon finds out. Rin is always questioning, trying to find answers herself and slow turning into a more sociable child. Things a child would normally do. If you have ever raised a child or lived with one, you know what I'm talking about. Still she has her own fears, not knowing whether she wants to meet her mother or not. Both characters are struggling to find answers to situations that they find difficult to deal with. There are quite a few other developments, but I think that's best left for the viewer to find out. I have to say I am quite intrigued and am closely following this show. \\n\\n\r\nThe art has grown on me more, either that or it has gotten considerably better. Either way it's actually pretty good for such a show like this, including the funny faces Rin makes. It's very simplistic, but it works. The water \"colory\" feel is still there, but I seem to remember it being a lot more watery \"colory.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe music is fairly ambient, setting up the mood for the viewer. I'm not to fond of the opening and closing songs, but I guess it does get the job done. \\n\\n\r\nI gotta say I enjoy this show. It has a very warm and fuzzy feeling around it. You really do get to like the characters and hate some like that annoying little girl with the pigtails, but anyways, they are strong, human and likeable. I can't say more about the story, it's just great, now I can't wait for the next episode it really is that good. Just go ahead and watch it if you want something to warm you up or else you can watch some other crappy show like Blood C.\\n",

            "content": "Before I watched Usagi Drop I wanted kids.\r\nAfter watching it I wanted kids, and I wanted to show this to my former girlfriend who didn't want kids to rub in her face how wrong she was.\r\nThe first and most striking aspect of Usagi Drop is how it drops the nuclear feels bomb on you in the first episode.\r\nYou're just watching a well-done anime with a realistic family and realistic characters and in less than one minute you go from appreciating this good anime to cursing the damn tears that stop you from watching it. You go from enjoying it to thinking it might be reallyawesome.\\n\r\nYou just leave any desire to watch or do something else than binge watch all of Usagi Drop.\\n\r\nAnd after you've binge watched, you write a review on MAL explaining how you don't regret a second of it.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop is three things:\\n\r\n- one, it's a lesson as to what Moe should really be. \"Cute girls doing cute things\" doesn't hold a candle to Usagi Drop's natural, well-constructed and profoundly efficient charm.\\n\r\n- two, it's a solid anime with a very simple(too simple) and straightforward story that continuously makes you appreciate children for what they can be, delightful little bits of love in tiny people, and also brats.\\n\r\n- three, it's an enabler for those people(like me) who say that Slice of Life is usually an enjoyable type of show, even if it's boring as a desert of salt.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop just should be watched, it should be seen if only to teach people who aren't into kids, slice of life or moe, how it can be incredibly enjoyable on an intellectual level as much as an emotional level.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6 - Starting off with a bang, the story quickly devolves into the dunce of Usagi Drop. While the basic premise of a girl who has a runaway mother and a dead father, taken in by a kind relative, seems like a strong buildup, and it is, the story barely gets anywhere after this. Daikichi adopts Rin, Rin needs a lot of things from him, and while the first two or three episodes do have a story from that, the ones after seldom follow. You just have bits and parts of people accepting Rin or Daikichi learning to be a better guardian, and the subplot with the mother of Kouki which doesn't get anywhere. It's weak, but fine.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 : A good case of style being the powerful tool here instead of precision or animation. Every character remains somewhat simple and yet has a very good visual identity, and you can pretty much tell what kind of people they are just from seeing them(for most). There is charm in the art and quality in the writing, and it's a resounding success to behold.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 10 : Ten may be overrating it, but to be fair I've had two shows ever succeed at blowing me away from sound alone: this one, and Kill la Kill. And maybe Stand Alone Complex.\\n\r\nUsagi Drop isn't that fantastic in terms of music diversity, but it holds a ridiculously solid soundtrack of just a few piano songs that set a tone and style better than any JRPG-sized soundtrack. More than just the few very strong tunes that bring out the feels like the opening of a dam of tears, the VA work is also very solid and not a single one is miscast, they all seem to work their part perfectly and I fell in love with little Rin's voice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7 : Only seven, but that's because half the cast is children and no seriously written children will be all that complex. They're all solid, cute or charming or outright adorable, and they all pitch in to bring something, but they're not groundbreaking.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 : In the past year where I've started gobbling down anime, I've often found myself enjoying lots of it, and finding others interesting. Usagi Drop is neither. The notion of children being a joy to have isn't all that novel to me, and even if it's really well portrayed, it's ultimately a show about a guy learning to take care of a cute little kid and that little kid showering everyone with love. It's cute as all hell and lovely to see, but \"enjoyable\" isn't the term I'd use. However if Usagi Drop manages a record of sorts, it's that despite not being all that fun nor all that interesting, it is a tremendously charming, cute, and feels-train time, and it raises itself to an 8/10 enjoyable time despite not being all that fancy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 : From episode 1 on, I expected a solid 8 to a possible 9/10, a really good to great anime, and although the feels were strong, it never really quite reached that 9, mostly because the story was really tame. It was still a very good time, so many cute moments to watch that bury the \"fighting with cute girls with big boobs\" crapnime under a pile of rubble, so much cuteness and charm from start to finish, so many smiles budding on my face, so many moments where I genuinely wanted to hug the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSome say Usagi Drop was made to push the Japanese to fix their birth rates, and I say that joke or not, they're right. It's a ridiculously good moe anime that not only buries all moe, but makes you appreciate the idea of having children with every scene.",

            "content": "Usagi Drop feels like the type of show that would be critically acclaimed, but just not be very interesting. By that I mostly mean the story telling elements were good, the characters were presented well, and parts were endearing. But even though it told the story very well, the story itself was not very interesting. It is a similar issue I have with some classic pieces of literature like Great Expectations (for example). The writing is clearly world class but the story that it is telling just isn't all that interesting. \r\nThe show definitely isn't bad, I'd just wish they introduced better conflict or something.This feels like it should be the first half of a show. It kills me to, because I actually really grew to enjoy their relationship and all, but nothing really happened. \\n\\n\r\nI know a lot of people don't like where the manga took the story, but honestly I feel like that wasn't a bad twist. Partly because at the pace the show was going there was just 0 suspense and conflict, but also because they did a really good job of portraying their relationship as not Father Daughter. To me it almost felt like they were just two humans who loved each other, not quite friends, and not quite family. And while there is other places it could have taken it, it feels faithful to that aspect to me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, even though I really liked the characters and the show started off strong to me, Usagi Drop ended up as just another average show.",

            "content": "Wow did this show really hit me in the feels and my personal life experiences. I was also adopted and, since my mother was sick for many years and eventually passed away when I was quite young, it has been just me and my dad since then. It's not always easy to be a part of a non-stereotypical family background, especially when facing the occasional prejudice from the rest of society. But in comes Usagi Drop and some beautiful perspective on what it means to be family and what loving unconditionally looks like, regardless of circumstance. \r\nStory: (9) \r\nThe premise is truly refreshing against thebackdrop of popular action, fantasy, mystery, etc. shows that seem to top the anime charts each season. Even within the scope of typical slice-of-life anime, Usagi Drop presents a unique story that focuses on the relationship between parent and child. Within the parent-child sub-genre itself, this show centers on the, practically never explored, bond between a first-time single father, Daikichi, and his newly adopted young \"daughter,\" Rin.  \\n\\n\r\nThe show follows a linear plot that centers on Rin's childhood years from day-care to early elementary school. I admit that I would have liked to see a longer run that explored Rin's life into adolescence..but the period of time that was focused on was executed beautifully. I especially appreciated how most episodes highlighted a certain childhood milestone (i.e. losing baby teeth) which brought back some nostalgic memories. \\n\\n\r\nOf other special note is the fact the effort Usagi Drop took to explore a variety of different family dynamics. While it mostly focused on the father and daughter bond, the single-mother relationship between both son and daughter were also included. These non-stereotypical families were juxtaposed against the typical \"father, mother, and a couple children families.\" Usagi Drop truly excelled at highlighting some of the difficulties of growing up in an \"unusual\" or typical familial dynamic alike, without stigmatizing any singular type of family. There was also some exceptional scenes of the occasional difficulties a father (male) has in trying to relate to a daughter (female) and vice versa for mother and son which can be further exasperated within single-parent families. \\n\\n\r\nPacing was good and I found myself surprised that an episode ended so quickly on several occasions. In summation, this show provided warm feel-good moments of Daikichi and Rin bonding along with the other parents and children they made friends with along the way. \\n\\n\r\nArt: (9) \\n\\n\r\nI appreciated the \"cutesy\" art style of soft lines and color palette that fit in with the overall fluffy atmosphere despite the ups and downs of parenting. Occasionally some scenes lost some precision because of the soft lines, but the majority of scenes were beautifully animated in their simplistic style. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs were refreshingly accurate for such a mundane setting (no crazy blue, green, purple, etc. hair that is often typical of other genres of anime), and the background sceneries, especially during the changing of seasons, were particularly superb. \\n\\n\r\nSound: (9) \\n\\n\r\nBoth the opening and ending songs fit the mood of the show perfectly with their upbeat, feel-good vibe. The ending song is particularly catchy and personally evoked some really nostalgic feels of childhood \u201cnaivety\u201d for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack within the show is able to encompass a cutesy, upbeat sound for cute child moments, as well as a more melancholic tone by utilizing strings, especially when regarding Rin\u2019s background, equally well. The OST is not incredibly impressive as a standalone work, but each scene is made that much more emotional with the accompanying music in each scene.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was superb and gave each character incredible depth. Rin and Kouki\u2019s VAs get a special round-of-applause from me for capturing the way children speak so well! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (10) \\n\\n\r\nFor such a short one-cour anime, each character in Usagi Drop was developed and explored incredibly well. \\n\\n\r\nRin wins the award for being the most well-behaved, easy-going, compassionate six year old ever! I found it incredible that a young girl in the troubled situation she was in was able to find happiness and contentment with the good things she did have. \\n\r\nLittle Kouki\u2019s character provided some excellent contrast to Rin\u2019s. While Rin is pretty mellow, Kouki is an energetic, \u201cdisregarding the rules of the adults,\u201d kid that is typical of many boys his age. Yet somehow Kouki showed an understanding of how to care for his \u201csmall\u201d family that went well beyond the selfishness and unawareness that one would expect in someone his age. Both children came from unusual circumstances and still made the cutest of childhood friends- I enjoyed watching all their antics throughout the show. \\n\\n\r\nDaikichi is a first-time dad, not to mention single, who does an excellent job learning quickly in how to care for Rin. His compassion and unconditional love he shows towards her and her friend Kouki is portrayed in both his actions and his words- the sacrifices he makes for his child along the way encompasses all the struggles and joys of becoming a good parent. Kouki\u2019s mother, Yukari, is also healthily involved in the life of her son and in Rin\u2019s as well. I enjoyed the cute bonding scenes between Daikichi and Yukari alone as well as the cute \u201cfamily\u201d moments between the both of them and each of their children. \\n\\n\r\nAnother highlight of the character relationships that is worth pointing out are the scenes in which we see just how important it is sometimes to have a mentor of the same sex for a child as they are growing up. The scenes between Daikichi and Kouki, and Yukari and Rin were a bit too few and far between for my taste, but the ones that were shown portrayed the reality that some things can really only be understood between two males or two females. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting characters were touched on enough to provide a sense of satisfaction and meshed with the main characters well. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10) \\n\\n\r\nEach episode of Usagi Drop was a joy to watch. When reflecting on this show, I am able to pinpoint many beautiful aspects of this show: parents sacrificing for their children, the growth of children and the pride of their parents, learning how to become a family despite any circumstance, and many other warm, fuzzy aspects. I looked forward to watching each episode and was so sad when I reached the last of this short 11-episode anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: (9) \\n\\n\r\nAs much as I enjoy fantasy and psychologically dark genres of anime, Usagi Drop provided a much needed get-away from such shows. It was nice to be reminded of good times with the loved ones I hold dear. This show is only 11 episodes long so I urge anyone to just give it a shot. If you immerse yourself in this show, you will be able to gain a better perspective on how to find happiness no matter how unusual your circumstances are. \\n",

            "content": "Usagi drop is an Anime that definitely has charm. The intro music in itself was enough to bring a smile to my face.\r\nIf I were to summarize the feel of the show it is that it is something to watch on a lazy weekend or to lighten your heart after a hard day at work.\r\nThe main protagonist 30 year old Daikichi certainly proves himself, sticking by what he believes is right even if it makes life more difficult for him. This instantly makes his character likable, despite no other immediately special or interesting features about him. He is just an average guy. He is nota hero out to slay monsters but a hero that feels closer to home, a parent, which is what makes this show so special. He dives into a whole new battle, raising a child, with almost the naivety of a child himself.\\n\\n\r\nThe progression of the story certainly seems natural and in no way forced, feeling realistic in both the character development and how the plot is portrayed. However, I will admit my mind struggled to come to terms with the main concept and catalyst of the tale, Rin being the illegitimate child of Daikichi's 70 odd year old grandfather, but it didn't take me long to get over the weirdness of the situation and enjoy the relationship between the two protagonists and the direction that they take.\\n\\n\r\nThe joy, laughs and feelings it brings are all through general acts in the everyday that are brought about by having to raise a child. There is nothing groundbreaking there, but the tenderness and beauty of it is what I found so enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is not one I would typically be drawn to, but it fits the show perfectly through its subtlety and uncliche feel. It definitely complements the simplicity of an every day style story with its neutrality and it also allows a feeling of nostalgia and warmth to be portrayed. For these reasons I wouldn't want anyone to choose not to watch this show if they are not keen on the art style, it is worth it.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi Drop is a beautiful and heartwarming show which left me wanting more, and although after completing the series I did feel there was not a true air of finality, after looking up the continuation in the manga I am glad to see it left as it; giving you a taste of sweet longing and innocence.\\n\\n",

Every week waiting for the next installment. The simple things in life may be so delightfull and this story shows that. \\n\\n\r\nI sure advise to watch it and I am happy that we can expect such jewels to come about now and then!",

            "content": "Usagi Drop is a very heart-warming story about a little girl (that is illegitimate) growing up with a new guardian who has zero parenting skills, after her real father dies. As the story progresses, this little girl presents many challenges that she receives for herself and her new parent. During a year of living in a new place, she shows so many cute sides of herself leaving me to wonder if being a parent is as great as it looks.\r\nStory 9/10\r\nThis story is a very heart-warming one with a wonderful ending. The story at first starts out really slow and kind of boring, but afterthe first episode, things tend to pick up speed and progresses at a very good pace. Daikichi is presented with many challenges that every parent must face at one time or another and tries his hardest to be a good parent and a good friend. Rin finally gets to make friends and discover new things about life and slowly shows her personality to the people she has grown attached to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\nThe supporting characters of this series are not very unique, but the main characters (Daikichi and Rin) do seem to have some originality. Unlike many other anime shows I've seen, Rin is actually portrayed as a very innocent child that gets frustrated and sometimes ashamed with growing up. Daikichi seems like a very boring and lazy guy, but is showing his good will and good character by sacrificing more for Rin than he originally thought he would.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nI was  very impressed with the art and  liked how they tended to use two different art styles. In the beginning of each episode the style reminds me of what people would use when trying to convey a flashback or memory, while the rest of the episode is another more defined style.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style all together feels very nostalgic of what anime shows in the 80's and 90's had.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe music in the show is just spectacular. It is what makes this anime, not just a show, but a piece of art.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI couldn't get enough of the cute situations that Rin was always showing. It really makes me wish that I had a six year old kid. This is something I probably won't forget and I wish there were more than just 11 episodes. I hope there will be another season.\\n\\n\r\nSubs Used: [Kanjouteki]\\n\\n\r\nSimilar Animes:\\n\r\nAishiteruze Baby\\n\r\n- Aishiteruze Baby is about a girl who has been abandoned temporarily and has to live with a new household.

            "content": "If there's one phrase that describes Usagi Drop, it would be \"gentle yet thoughtful\". Usagi drop, at heart, is a simple series about a bachelor learning to raise a little girl, and learning all the joys and hurdles of being a parent along the way. The story premise itself is such a simple idea, yet the way in which Usagi drop goes about the story brings about a near perfect blend of light-hearted moments, as well as some more subtle and serious undertones. The plot itself is delicately woven, and complements the charming characters quite well. The overall result is some quiet and relaxed storytelling.\r\nThisseries, when you boil things down, is about parenting. To be more specific, the series' central focus is on Daikichi's growth as a parent, and how that gradually changes his perspective of many little details around him. While the premise itself sounds simple, the story progresses through Daikichi's new life with Rin in an extraordinarily realistic yet thought-provoking manner.\\n\\n\r\nAt the same time, the plot also explores some rather serious themes and ideas, all while balancing in the adorable antics of the cast. Darker themes such as single-parenthood, parents abandoning their children, divorce, and unhappy marriages, are all touched upon in this series. The balance between the serious and goofy moments in this series is superb, although this does somewhat break down near the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nUsagi drop is a rather unambitious series in a way, where it's not aiming for any sort of grand story. Yet it's the sheer simplicity of the story which makes this series so charming. We see little everyday moments like chopping up ingredients for dinner, or going shopping for a backpack, or jump roping in the local park, that makes for many memorable and charming moments. The chemistry between the main cast is great as well, and is gradually developed through the entire series. You really grow to sympathize with these characters as they grow up, and experience both their joyful and worrisome moments alongside them.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Usagi drop is a wonderful little slice of life series that was a relaxing and enjoyable watch. It proved to be an endearing series all the way until it's final moments, and brought plenty of smiles and laughter along the way. The anime does get a bit more overdramatic towards the end, yet it's believable enough to strike a chord with most viewers. Usagi drop explores it's themes in some rather clever ways, and has resulted in one of the most down-to-earth yet charming slice of life anime I've seen in a long time.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSetting: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.0/10\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment: 8.6/10 (Rounded up to a 9 on MAL)",

            "content": "Rarely in anime, do we ever get a heart warming tale that is slice of life combined with some comedy. Now a days, anime is concentrated on boobs, harem, or moe. Usagi Drop, however, concentrates on what it really means to be family, and how a tragedy can bring families together, and all the hard ships parents have to go through with  kids, even if the kids aren't their own.\r\nUsagi Drop was aired this past summer, animated by Production I.G. and Fuji TV, and the original novel was written by Unita Yumi. The anime follows Daikichi, an average man, focused on his job, butall of a sudden his grandpa dies. Right after the death, it is revealed that his grandpa had an illegitimate child with one of his maids! Rin, the child is stuck in a limbo and no one wants to take care of her, until Daikichi takes her under his care. At first, he doesnt know exactly how to handle Rin, but over time, their bond develops, and he realizes what it truly means to be a parent.\\n\r\nThe story was very simple slice of life, but it was not two people falling in love, but more the bond between an adult and a child. You are not actually able to hear what Rin thinks, but you are more or less following Daikichi and his part of the bond. You see all the sacrifices that he makes in order to do the best for Rin, even if it means he will loose pay at his company so he can be home earlier to take care of her.\\n\r\nI highly recommend Usagi Drop if you're looking for a slice of life with no ecchi, no lolicon, and just a pure story. Often times, this anime will make you smile in a way that can only be described as heartwarming. It will bring pureness into your life, and make you wonder what would you give up for the sake of a child.\\n\\n\\n\r\nReviews can also be found at my blog http://chiichannel.blogspot.com/ :D",

Mainly, it allowed for the characters to develop well, and made the anime flow easily to the viewer.\r\n7/10\r\nArt:\r\nI liked how before the opening the art was more childish to then transition to the actual art. The art itself is good, it really fits the anime's atmosphere.\r\n8/10\r\nSound:\r\nThe sound was fine, like the art, it fitted the atmosphere. However, I was never particularly impressed by it.\r\n7/10\r\nCharacter:\r\nThis is where Usagi drop excels. The relationship between the two main characters is very well constructed anddeveloped. Furthermore, even secondary characters had a good share of development, and all characters seemed credible.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe characters and plot allowed me to have a new insight on parenthood. And because of it, my enjoyment was good. \\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nWhile not being a fan of the genre, Usagi Drop still impressed me. I finished the anime thoughtful, feeling like I learned something, which is extremely rare. With that said, Usagi Drop remains as a breath of fresh air, but is by no means an anime masterpiece. I did enjoy the anime, and would recommend it to anyone pondering about parenthood as it provides valuable insight and different perspectives.\\n\r\n7/10",

Now without a guardian, as the mother is no longer in the picture for reasons later revealed, Daikichi takes on the role of being a surrogate father and Rin moves in with him. We are shown him struggling to get to grips with his new situation, getting knowledge and insight from parents around him (orhis childhood) and making sacrifices needed to be made as a new parent. As for Rin we see her natural progression through the stages of childhood; and her growing into her new home. \\n\\n\r\nRin is a loveable, sweet girl who at first appears quite closed off. Once comfortable with Daikichi she is louder and loving, and he often bears the brunt of her childish teasing. Daikichi is a selfless character; he is kind and seems fairly stoic but is actually easily flustered and swayed into giving Rin what she wants. He has a great want to raise Rin right, and we see his insecurity that he won't. He may often overreact when put in a quite harmless situation that other seasoned parents would barely bat an eye at; but this can be written off as his inexperience. \\n\\n\r\nA number of other characters make reappearances such as Daikichi's parents, his cousin Horiko and her daughter Reina. The most prominent would be Kouki, a friend of Rin's, who is little bit of troublemaker; and to a lesser extent his single mother Nitani (whom Daikichi warms to quite immediately).  \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is unique and cute; and mainly just soft colours are used. \\n\\n\r\nMostly just fluff; but there are some complex subjects covered.  Such as an estranged mother, complicated family ties, what it is to be married and of course the death of a loved one. Some are touched on more frequently than others; but all are done in an intelligent and heart-felt way. \\n\\n\r\nRecommended if you just want something mainly fun to watch. A good slice of life.",

            "content": "I have not enjoyed an anime as much as I enjoyed this one for a very long time. I did not read the manga so I can not compare it for following the story line but the story as presented in the anime was solid and stuck with the plot the whole way through. Unlike many other story lines which progress steady until the end when they suddenly need to wrap up.\r\nI am myself a 30-something man and I think this played a lot into my attraction for this anime. Who doesn't feel the need to shelter a little girl in that kind of situation?\r\nTheart style was rather appropriate given the focus of the show, it's about children after all. Even so the quality of the work was still very good, despite that I know some people who rejected the show simply for the art, their loss.\\n\\n\r\nThe theme songs were fun and uplifting, I normally don't bother listening to them in general but I spent some more time on this series to enjoy the songs.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be a crime not to make a sequel for this series, something about the characters just makes you want to know what happens next. I want to see what happens to the small family as the kids grow up, attend middle and high school. I want to watch the relationships between the adults grow and develop as well.\\n\\n\r\nThis show doesn't have great big huge dramatic events unwinding around some epic plot devised by some grand hero or villain. As such it's not the same old story line, it's every day life but somehow, that's more interesting, more important or exciting than the next grand adventure.",

Both of their life's changed for the good when they met each other for the first time, at that funeral in the first episode.

However after the first episode i found myself looking forward to the next episode then the one after than, and the one after that etc. This is a story that anyone would like it is nothing more than a tale of a kind man who sacrifices for a child yet by the end he doesn't view it as a sacrifice\r\nStory 9\r\nThe story was well written and focused on the main characters interaction with each other and development ofthe characters as well as a slight romance towards the end (which i found heart warming). The story takes place over the course of about a year and touched an many real life subjects ie abandoning a child, adopting a child and learning to raise a child. The whole story was nicely told and and the ending left me feeling all warm and happy which is rear in most of the anime normaly watch\\n\\n\r\nArt 10\\n\r\nThe art in this anime was unique all, the background art was hand drawn and while it was not a graphical impressive as other anime series i have watched however the hand drawn aspect really help the story in this case giving it a more of a personal feel as if the world around the characters was created just for them (which it was). The Art was beautiful and well drawn \\n\\n\r\nSound 9\\n\r\nThe music was soft and heart felt giving an emotional feel to the series. both opening and ending themes suited the anime perfectly\\n\\n\r\ncharacter 9\\n\r\nThe characters were very good Daikichi and Rin's relationship develop well over the year the story spans they become closer and develop a bigbrother/father relationship and how they over come the obsticals of life together.\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment 9\\n\r\ni thoroughly enjoyed the series from start to finish\\n\\n\r\noverall 9\\n\r\nover all i give the series a 9 and it would have been 10 had the romance of the series progress a bit further between Dikichi and Yukari other than that the series was great",

            "content": "First, I'd like to say that this is my first review, so I apologize if it isn't very good.\r\nBefore watching Usagi Drop, I don't think I've ever fully taken time to appreciate what my parents have done for me and the things that they have sacrificed. This anime shows just what comes with being a parents and how it can be scary, difficult, and demanding (both mentally and physically). However it also shows the many joys of being a parent and I personally, would love to have a daughter like Rin one day.\r\nThe story is relatively simple. Daikichi is a 30 year old manthat lives on his own. The day of his grandfather's funeral, he meets Rin, his grandfather's \"illegitimate\" daughter. Rin is only 6 at the time and her mother has left without a trace. No one in the family wants to take care of Rin, so Daikichi ends up taking care of her.  \\n\r\nFrom then on, the anime shows the life of these two and the simple events of everyday life that they experience. Usagi Drop, while simple, displays a amazing amount of charm and a constant feeling of warmth (for lack of a better word). Every episode just made me feel happy and warm inside. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is very pretty to look at. The art here settles for a water colour design that befits it extremely well. The environments really help sell the overall simple but lovely feel of the show. The animation itself is very good, but nothing extraordinary. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound for Usagi Drop is also very good. All the voice actors do their job really well and especially Rin's as she was voiced by a girl around her age. This definitely gave the a sense of authenticity to the show. The music is \\n\r\nalso good, however nothing really stands out in my opinion. I'm certainly not rushing to buy the soundtrack CD. The opening and ending weren't something all that special in my opinion, with the former reminding me a lot of Clannad's ending. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what make this show so great, in my opinion. Daikichi, the  main character is very  likable. I think the main reason is that he is 30 years old, and therefore does not possess many of the traits that make a lot of the   dominant teenage protagonists annoying, in my opinion. At first, he is very much unsure of his capabilities to take care of Rin bit gradually learns what it means to be a parent as he begins to care for Rin more and more in a fatherly way.  \\n\\n\r\nRin herself is adorable. She and Ushio Okazaki are by far the cutest people in anime if you ask me. She is intelligent, caring and really modest. She is also incredibly mature for someone her age. She's utterly impossible to hate and I challenge anyone not to \"aww\" because of her during the course of the anime. What is also great about her is she indirectly teaches Daikichi many things as well as myself while watching this. \\n\\n\r\nThe other supporting characters are also for the most part, likable. You have Rin's friends Kouki and Reina. Although these two are very excited and loud children, their innocence makes it sort of funny and not as annoying as I first expected. Kouki's mother, Yukari, befriends Daikichi and the moments between them I found to be lovely. As they are both single parents (in a way), they share a lot of moments by helping each other, usually concerning Rin and Kouki. The rest of the supporting characters are all rather likable apart from maybe Rin's mother, whom we never really are given a proper explanation of her situation and thus are given no resolution. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if you like slice of life anime, then I'm sure you'll love this. The story has so much charm that it made me feel so happy inside. If only it were longer than 11 episodes as it left me wanting more. Much more. However, I saw that the story in the manga continues on after where the anime ended. Hopefully that could mean a season 2 (fingers crossed). \\n\\n\r\nIf you've read this, thank you for taking the time to read my review and please feel free to offer any feedback. \\n\\n",

The anime brought a wonderful surface exploration of the transition of personal awareness from self of self to self as parent and self of primary family.  The anime examines an immediate \"immersion\" into one parent family life in a unique way.  Some real tough topics are approached in a heart-felt manner that can really leave you thinking or laughing or crying... or any combination.  \r\n  The exploration of parenting as a sacrifice or an expansion of a person's life is conducted via veryinteresting ways.  We get to see glimpses into a few perspectives through the story line.  I must say that there are some common experiences in parenting that are found in the story line that just make \"Usagi Drop a dear \"gem\".  \\n\r\n  While exploring the title prior to watching it, I noticed it was generally classified as  Josei.  I have had little experience with this genre that I am aware.  I am happy to report I will be looking for more Josei titles.\\n\r\n  Although my parenting years are long past, as my children are adults now, I still vividly recalled memories and feelings from those times while watching this warming series.

            "content": "Behind the cuteness and simplicity lies a strong bond between a father and \"daughter\".\r\nAnime dealing with various themes about actual reality are rare. Most of the time, we get a semi-realistic settings that does not manage to capture the feeling of living in a real world. \r\nUsagi Drop is one of those rare shows that really touch upon the real world scenario, bringing up one of the most complicated times in ones life; raising a child.\r\nTo put it simply, Usagi Drop follows the story of Daikichi, a 30 year old salesman who adopts Rin, the illegitimate child of his grandfather.\r\nIt may sound like a simpleslice of life about an adult raising a child (and it is) but it's how that said adult deals with the act and actions that really makes the show shine. From Daikichi's point of view, we see how he raises up his adopted daughter, shifting his job, attending gatherings and mingling with other parents. As someone who has never raised a child and lacking in knowledge, one can truly see Daikichi's inexperience during conversations and interacting with the people he never really expected to talk and relate to. Of course, as the show progresses, so does his development, being one of the main highlight of the series. You get to see how Daikichi gets a hand of things from simplistic ones like enrolling and fetching Rin from a daycare to more pressing issues like changing the sheets after a case of \"child night bedsheet wetting\". He develops from this inexperienced, young adult to a loving, caring father.\\n\\n\r\nFurthering the show's charm is none other than Rin herself. Most people would find kids to be annoying crybabies who run around only to hurt themselves and cry some more. Rin is not that kind of kid. Sure, there's quite a characterization to make her stand out but it's that very same characterization that makes her just fun to watch. Her carefree and up-ish attitude is more enjoyable than annoying. Watching her interact and move about innocently feels very warming and smile-worthy. Like seeing two young toddlers, a boy and a girl, promise to get married sometime in the future.\\n\\n\r\nBacking up the show is a unique and simple art style involving pastels and light colors, very fitting for a series such as this. The character designs are quite neat and the backgrounds are light and beautifully drawn. Both aspects just balance well and are pleasing to the eyes, making the show much more relaxed, of course, as a compliment.\\n\r\nThis is all accompanied by a wonderful soundtrack consisting of xylophones, pianos and violins to bring about musical emotion and serenity to the scenes. It's all so simple yet so... elegant and heartwarming.\\n\\n\r\nA heartfelt and relaxing watch.\\n\r\nA show that tells and shows the happiness and difficulty about raising a child isn't really aimed at \"regular\" audience, but it makes for a good change of pace from all the cliche action shows you see everywhere these days.",

            "content": "One of my first reviews and  what better than to do it on Usagi Drop another one of those titles I hold so dear. The story overall is very heart warming which is portrayed very uniquely. \r\nThe story revolves on the main character Daikichi a single 30 year old who takes in a young girl Rin. The story is sweet and like I say very heart warming as you see the characters develop. The overall animation is very nice the colours used on the character and the scenery are very soft and colourful. I find the ending very satisfying for the anime. Overall UsagiDrop is a real enjoyable anime. And should be a must see. 10 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nlike many who have already reviewed this anime, this review is more for focused on people who plan on continuing the story after the anime. However if you do happen to finish the anime I would strongly advise that you should really leave it at that don\u2019t go looking for the manga series (I mean the storyline after the anime).\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT:\\n\\n\r\nThis is really when you should stop reading this review; this is about the manga what happens after Usagi drop the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAfter hearing good things about the manga from people mentioning how great and how much better it is compared to the anime I decided to read into it. I do have to admit that I only read the manga chapters after the anime\u2019s storyline I did not start the manga from the very beginning.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway the story continues with a fast forward in time 10 years to be exact where Rin is a high school student. The story continues to develop the characters but the story lacks the emotional qualities that were in the beginning when Rin is still a young girl. I guess one of the main attractions which im sure most of you will enjoy is seeing how the character Daikichi develops as he slowly becomes a father to Rin. The story progresses in a way where you want to cheer for Daikichi struggling and learning to be a single father.\\n\\n\r\nThe Manga\u2019s story continuation looses that the story instead is more focused on the chracter\u2019s love life. I kept reading it as I was thinking it might involve how Daikichi continues to learn how to be a father for a teenage daughter however sadly it\u2019s not as interesting as the beginning. Rins love life gets complicated especially with her childhood friends. The story seems to have changed genres all of a sudden, it\u2019s about this boy liking this girl, this girl liking this boy, this boy doesn\u2019t like this girl, and this girl doesn\u2019t like this boy.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT: this part is for after you have finished the manga.\\n\r\nRegardless the story near the end decides to drop a huge bomb. Suddenly you get Rin loving Daikichi as a lover, why? The story was going so well. It feels the story near the end of the series seemed to be rushed suddenly you get this bomb and then to \u201cmake it ok\u201d you have Rin not being blood related to Daikichi and then they agreed that they might love one another romantically after Rin graduates which then you have yet another fast forward 2 years. Then you see Daikichi and Rin starting to be romantically involved (cause Daikichi accepted Rin) and then you hear Rin\u2019s future plans of wanting to have Daikichi\u2019s baby and raise it with him then end of story.\\n\\n\r\nMy reactions to story line after the anime especially with the ending gave me a sick feeling and also rather upset. How can you start a story where you were focusing on something that drew the readers/viewers to continue and then suddenly change the plot? We have a heart warming sweet story right at the start and then we have something completely different leading towards the feeling of incest. This is possibly one of the reasons the anime doesn\u2019t have a sequel.\\n",

I've been watching many action and comedy animes, and I figured it out to try to watch something that will.. uhh make me relax for a bit. And yep, I finally found it.\r\nA life of a parent wasn't that easy, and it'll be great if those people in adulthood would watch this and gain more lessons on how to raise a kid when watching it. Heheh.\r\nI like how things work well in the story, and I think it's great to see more shining love, smiles and laughter. Rin's smile was my favorite part, she's so cute.  I like thisanime series because I'm enjoying and find it really great to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAlso I'm quite disappointed because this series was too short and never seen Rin grow to adolescence, or even Daikichi did get a wife or something... That's the part where it's dull for me.\\n\\n\r\nBut after I finished watching it, I immediately recommend this to a friend of mine who likes watching animes. And yes, he likes it.\\n\\n\r\nMy overall rating is 10. That is all.\\n\\n",

            "content": "If I can use two words to describe Usagi Drop those words would be simple and heartwarming. The premise promises a nice slice of life anime about parenthood and that is exactly what it delivers. Much like Rin herself this anime is short and sweet.\r\nStory: 7\r\nUsagi Drop handles a very interesting topic in single parenthood but with a single father rather than single mother (because come on how many anime protagonists live in unconventional households like that). I will say that I came away from this anime wishing it were longer, maybe showing Daikichi before meeting Rin or maybe ending with Rin growing into adulthoodwith Daikichi reflecting on the memories of her growing up that he got to share in. Really though I feel like this anime isn't trying to tell a long story. Instead each episode focuses on rather mundane life experiences and I feel like the writers did their research on how children behave because this part of the story was very believable. \\n\\n\r\nI do have to criticize Usagi Drop from not really moving past its original premise. Its a single 30 year old guy raising a six year old girl...and thats all it is. The story advances to about 1 year and then just sort of stops. Also much is made about the relationship between Daikichi's grandfather and Rin's mother Masako. Sadly story never really wraps up that plot line (which I wished it would because the age gap in that relationship is the least believable thing in this anime). In the end if you look at Usagi Drop as just a short and simple slice of life anime then you get what you came for...nothing more and nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nNothing about the art style stands out really except for this childish art style that is used before the opening credits in each episode. Its a subtle shift and serves little purpose but the style itself reminds me of a child coloring with crayons. As for the main animation style...its good...that's about it. Nothing artistically spectacular here but the animation does the job.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nMuch like the art, the sound does the job. The music complements the mood of each scene well enough and the voice acting is actually very good. I almost gave this section an 8 but stopped short because the soundtrack stayed in the background and supported the story which is just what it needed to do.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThe strongest aspect of Usagi Drop is its characters which are mostly realistic and have their own wants, dreams, and flaws. Upon reflection though I was surprised to realize that some of the best characters are the supporting cast. Rin herself is adorable and acts much like a little girl in her situation might but as the anime progresses she is just a sweet little girl...which again is really all she needs to be. Daikichi talks alot about how he has changed since Rin came into his life but sadly we never get to see this so the audience never sees him grow. To me the most interesting characters are Haruko, Yukari and their children Reina and Kouki. These characters, along with other parents that we meet later, really show the sacrifices parents make for their children whether it means staying in an unhappy marriage because you know you can't support your child on your own, or sacrificing your own career for the sake of raising your child. The career sacrifices parents make is actually a reoccurring theme in Usagi Drop which is why Masako is such an interesting character. Early on we learn that Masako chose her career over her child though later on she shows some signs of regretting this fact. The fact that we never really see Masako's story arc pan out, along with a few other things is what keeps this category at an 8 instead of a 9.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOnce again I was really hoping this anime would be longer and explore the theme of parenthood from raising a child to seeing them grow into adulthood but I understand that is not what the writer was trying to do. The show focuses on the mundane and the plot takes place over about a year. I came into this anime looking for something heartwarming and thats just what Usagi Drop served up but I could really go for seconds. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nI really wanted to give Usagi Drop a higher score but looking at what else I have on my list I couldn't justify an 8. The 8's on my list include things like Azumanga Daioh and Itazura na Kiss, shows that take their starting premise and run with it until their character's have developed completely within a certain timeframe. Usagi Drop is far less ambitious and though it does its job well, as I said Usagi never moves past its original premise. Still I would recommend Usagi Drop for anyone who wants a short but sweet heartwarming story.",

I can see the same character styles in over a million anime! the studio needs to work hard on that and on the story too! it has to be deeper and more interesting, although there are a lot of people who already like this kind of animes so it is ok to watch it it's not that boring, however,  I would not recommend it to anyone!   \\n\\n",

But as I was just casually going through my Completed list of animes, I finally felt like writing a review. And I thought this anime was the right choice. Usagi Drop, one of my all-time favorite animes, which was left out of my favorites list because I was indecisive on what anime I should remove. Long intro aside, lets get into this.\r\nUsagi Drop is a cute little story about a man in his thirties, named Daikichi, and his adopted daughter, Rin. I say story, but its reallyall about the growth of Daikichi and the interactions between the two. And it really is beautiful. This is not an anime for the people who watch anime for the action and epicness that some of them bring. Rather, this is for people who want a lighthearted story about a man trying to be a dad for his adopted child.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nI really have no right to rate this. This anime is a slice of life about character interactions rather than plot. All I'll say here is that the ending to this anime was abrupt and sudden. It felt very rushed to say the least, but its about the only complaint I have with this anime. It's also only 11 eps, and I wish it was longer. That's just me being selfish though.^-^\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 10\\n\r\nI love the artstyle of this anime. It's very light and colorful, fitting the tone and mood of this anime perfectly. I love the character designs too, especially Rin. SHE. IS. SO. CUUUTE!!! The animation was good too. I think that an anime of this style doesn't need much budget for animation, but this anime blew my expectations anyway. It's really good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nOP was fine, but I always skipped the ending theme. The ED just didn't fit my taste. The songs throughout the anime matched the scene they were played on well, but none of them really stuck out. Now, the voice acting was absolutely brilliant. Rin's voice fit her amazingly, and Daikichi's was absolutely stunning too. The sound effects were fine as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nI love the characters. The characters have such relatable personalities and expressions, all except Rin. Rin is such a goody goody it's impossible. I have never met a 6 year old irl that was as responsible and caring as Rin. Daikichi, I could see the progression his character makes in the anime. He goes from unsure to more confident on what he's doing. And that progression is what makes his character shine. All the side characters had actual depth to them too. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nIs there really a need for me to say anything here? I love this anime very much, and is close to my heart as well. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nI recommend this anime to anyone who likes to watch a slow, heart filled story. This anime really is special among the vast sea of other Slice of Life shows that are always similar to each other. Now, sequel please? x)",

This story is about a grandson who takes in his grandpa's illegitimate daughter, (I know the plot sounds kind of lame). But , believe me, you will enjoy how the story develops. Usagi drop is a very realistic in terms of the relationship between the grandson and his grandpas' daughter(or his aunt to be literal). There aren't any over dramatic scenes-- those annoying scenes that are too emotional or simply out of point. \r\nIt is like the writer of the story painted on his/her canvasevery part of the story from a real-life situation without removing or adding any extra details. The art of the story itself seems to speak in a similar way. \\n\r\nOverall, Usagi Drop is a lighthearted and entertaining story which no one with a thing for slice-of-life genres should miss out. \\n",

            "content": "Usagi Drop to me is a breath of fresh air. It is a nice slice of anime about a 30 year old man who has to take care of his late grandfather's 6 year old daughter. \r\nThe character development is as realistic as it can get. There are no elements of fantasy or any outlandish situations, so it it very down to earth. There are no elements of fan service what so ever and it is pretty straight forward. Usagi Drop is both heartwarming and realistic. Every episode makes you feel warm and fuzzy and good. I would really recommend this show for people whowant to take a short break from the usual over the top elements that we see in many current anime shows.",

            "content": "Life is portrayed overly perfect and warm.\r\nThe story is not practical. I was hoping this slice of life anime to be more real. Really. I don't think and won't and have never seen any people who would easily adopt a child out of impulsiveness and what you think so call \"love.\" In real life, there will be a lot more to prepare. Nowadays, a lot of parents needs to prepare and plan and think what are the things that they can give to their future children and whether or not they have enough $ and time to support a new life. They really need todo all those things before they make a new life, not after they've already given birth. This is what I call being responsible. Any person who act out of impulsiveness and tries to be hero to some one, really don't really know what they are doing. \\n\r\nThe anime portrayed parenting overly easy, everything is portrayed overly wonderful. And the light-headed Daiichi suddenly adopted a child without carefully thinking and planning. He just suddenly adopted her just because he felt sympathetic and just. I think this kind of impulsiveness would bring a lot of problems and things will definitely won't turn out so smooth and happy and fortunate, like the anime. Daiichi is portrayed so lucky to have so many warm people popped up to help him. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a cartoon directed at children who believes that heroes still exists and there always will be happy ending.",

It's, in my perspective, a feel good show (kind of).\r\nIf you read the synopsis you already know that Daikichi is taking care of Rin which she so happens to be his Granddad's daughter which makes her Daikichi's aunt, i know its really weird/hard to understand. So we follow the life of Daikichi and Rin and begin to realize how hard it is to raise a child by your own, we see the hardships and joys of having a child and how you would do anything for their sake.\r\nI wish there was more episodes tothis anime because i really enjoyed it. I would have loved to see the stages of life through Rin's character as she goes from pre-k all the way to high school. I also would have loved to see how Daikichi ended up relationship wise.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really had fun watching this show and I'm certain that you will too.",

There he learns that the grandfather recently had a child droopped off at his place. it was his illegitimate child. First ep is basically about the main character figuring for himself that the kid is really his grandfathers child and about who is going to take the kid home. No one had time nor cared about her so the main guy decided to take her home. I am guessing its going to be about him and his kid-aunt under one roof. it looks likeit will be fun. Not hilarious but it will have a good serious story to it.\\n\\n\r\nEdit: \\n\\n\r\nI have watched 3 more episodes and I can honestly say I am loving where this is going. its calm, sweet and pretty funny. I love the way they ortrait the little girl. If you like a good story about a single dad and a lovely kid, this is a great story for you.",
