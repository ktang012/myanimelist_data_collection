            "content": "Before watching this show, I'd recommend you Wiki-up on the term known as \"Stockholm syndrome\". It will help you understand the ultimate wrong aspect of this anime far better, but, unfortunately, it still won't ease the fact that this anime is completely and utterly average. \r\nThe story is really simple and there isn't much to it: the girl joins high school, wants to make friends, lies to them about having a boyfriend, turns out that her made-up boyfriend goes to same school with her and is quite popular, he for some reason agrees to go along with her charade and then their adventures begin. Ican't say much for the story because there isn't any really. As a mainly character-driven series, the story is put-off into the sidelines and has trouble pacing itself over the episodes. At times, the episodes skip months worth of content they could show, and, for some reason, literally nothing seemed to have changed. I won't detail it out because it might be a spoiler, but you'll understand, trust me. The reason I gave the story such a low score is that even what's there isn't that good. It's predictable and filled with cliches and doesn't really work as a whole on any level. \\n\\n\r\nProduction of the show is its strongest part, alongside the comedy, and is quite eye-catchy. Especially for girl viewers. Even though there are some cute girls, most of them are not really THAT cute, while most of the guys that are important are made out to be quite hot - hence, extremely impossible to relate to just off the basis of the art. Animation hinges on the simplicity of movement and not much else and the series as a whole doesn't really have any heavy scenes when it comes to either art or sound. Speaking of sound, I had a really hard time hearing any music during this anime. For some reason, nothing stuck out and for the most part I didn't even bother looking for it. Voice actors did their jobs decently, but nothing really spectacular there either.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I expect you have looked up what I asked you to, so I can continue with my depiction of the characters in this show. We have Erika, our main girl, who desperately wants to fit in into high school and lies through her teeth to do so. I can relate to that and, probably, most people who've gone through high school can. What differs us, normal humans, from her is simply how far she's willing to push her lie. It goes bounds and leaps beyond what any sane human, who isn't riddle with any mental illness, would do. While the show puts it all on \"extreme masochism\", it's not. It can't be. You can't give such a vague attribute to your character and expect all her actions to make sense. Regardless of what Sato did to her, she came running back. Regardless of how much he'd hurt her, she came running back. It's not masochism - not even a form of it. It can be only explained as a complete and utter mental illness and, to be honest, show should have been about her going to the shrink and fixing it. Aside from that trait, she's not that interesting to watch. She's kind of likable, I guess,  and is shown to be a pathological liar although I'm pretty sure that whoever wrote this story really shouldn't attribute any mental illnesses to his/hers characters ever again because they have no basic idea what they are.\\n\\n\r\nNext up we have Sata, extreme version of male-tsundere. I'm going to say it upfront: nobody will ever relate to this character. And if you do, you are a horrible human being and you should know it. He lacks any likable traits, and I'd be fine with that if those unlikable traits were realistic. He's also showcased as sadist, but, again, I'm pretty sure that whoever wrote this doesn't understand what that means. He often says that he doesn't do it because he likes to, but still does it, which kind of contradicts the entire premise of the sadist. Instead, 90% of the things he says are intended to hurt the other party, and not in a sarcastic and funny way. Calling someone a dog over and over and over again, shunning the other people's emotions, dragging them along, doing things that go far beyond simple bullying - that's the kind of character Sata is. \\n\\n\r\n[MINOR SPOILER]\\n\r\nThere's a certain scene midway through the anime where Erika and Sata are sitting alone in a coffee shop and she asks him what he thinks of her. He then proceeds to tell her how much he likes her and turns it over by the end. Her reaction is okay, I guess, but what's the point of this is that it really showcased just how shallow, uninteresting and borderline insane character Sata is.\\n\r\n[/MINOR SPOILER END]\\n\\n\r\nThis goes for the majority of the characters: all of them (aside from 1 or 2 maybe) seem to be suffering from some sort of a pathological illness, or they're just really, really, really stupid. I won't describe any more because they aren't really worth the page. \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy the anime? Relatively, to be honest, hence this high of a score for all the bashing. Humor, for the most part, was well done and the show did make me laugh out loud a couple of times, but that was about it. Romance is shallow, insane and simply unrealistic, and the 'drama' moments are worth less than those of Clannad. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, unless you just want to fill your list with rom-coms, I'd stay away from this. Especially if you're looking for likable and relate-able characters.",

            "content": "A desire for acceptance is something that most of us can relate to, and at times that can drive us to certain extremes. It's a premise that is not necessarily unique, but for a shoujo series it actually is. The cliched trope of a spineless heroine and her tsundere love interest is all too common. However this series provides us with a slight variant; our main character is a compulsive liar with a penchant for emotional punishment (read: she's a masochist) that happens to, in a series of poor decisions and bad judgment, land herself a two-faced jerk who is content to treat her likea dog.\\n\\n\r\nOriginality is not this anime's forte, per se, but it is successful as a romantic comedy because it is uncommon. The two main leads seem initially very unlikeable, but if you accept the fact that they mutually (consensually) engage in something of a sadomasochistic relationship\u2014that neither one seems to want to disband even when given the chance\u2014then the series provides some amusing comedy.\\n\\n\r\nErika is not your traditional shoujo heroine, she's actually a plucky, resilient lead who for reasons unbeknownst to most viewers, seems to enjoy Kyouya's treatment. When situations arise that would stereotypically end in an angst-filled fight between our couple, Erika maintains her usual headstrong, blind determination to win over her ice-hearted prince. She does actually develop as the series progresses, because initially his treatment of her does seem to bring her spirits down, yet she rather quickly begins to learn just how Kyouya works and how outwardly dishonest he is\u2014and she adapts.\\n\\n\r\nKyouya is perhaps less impressive on the face of things, but the amusing reality is that he's not like your traditional tsundere love interest in that he doesn't have much in the way of redeeming qualities. He is, quite frankly, a jerk to Erika constantly and only occasionally showers her with some vague form of affection. But the series doesn't try too hard to redeem him\u2014he has no sad backstory to fall on, as he says himself. His behavior is not entirely without cause, given the influence of his older sister. Being cynical and misanthropic seems to run in the family.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is entertaining albeit peripheral, and they receive minimal attention or development. That is a disappointing fact about the series, which was limited in how much screen time it could offer them given its short runtime. But for their part in the series, they did contribute to the development of the main couple and to the overall humor of their antics.\\n\\n\r\nFor the part of the plot, there is nothing original in the least\u2014it is the traditional shoujo setup from the beginning until the end. What pulls it off in a unique way is the characters that are seemingly cliche but vary quite drastically from any traditional leads in a romance series. They carry the series where the plot might otherwise flop for not being terribly thought provoking or entertaining. It's the same old setup, but delivered in a way that can still rouse some amusement because the way everything plays out seems bland at first but the spice of the characters bring it some flavor.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the animation, the color palette is vibrant and charming. In comparison to the manga, it actually has adapted all of the character designs quite nicely and all of the scenes have at least done justice to or provided some improvement on their counterpart. Although it is like any other shoujo style, each design is unique and rather fitting giving each character's unique persona.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately another weak area is perhaps the soundtrack. The opening is catchy and adorable, but during the course of the series there are a few scenes with background music that just seem utterly out of place in an almost comedic sense. In general, the series doesn't suffer too much in this category\u2014at least not too noticeably, but it does lack the ability to match its own mood properly at certain moments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the series has enough merits to warrant it being a good shoujo anime. Although this review may lead you to believe that the main characters are the most redeeming part of the series, it would be disingenuous to claim they aren't the least bit frustrating. If you have difficulty appreciating that they are more nuanced than they seem at first glance, then you will be hard pressed to find anything enjoyable about the series. This certainly is not for everyone, it's not about a sweet couple that fall in love gradually\u2014it's about two characters who are so entirely human that they are flawed and utterly unlikeable, but as a result of which, happen to be highly entertaining together.",

            "content": "I read the manga version few years ago but dropped it eventually because of how annoying the characters were - especially Erika.\r\nI was actually surprised that it was adapted into anime. One day, I saw a video on youtube for \"top best shoujo anime of all time\" and this anime was included, so I decided to give it a try, which I regretted A LOT.\r\nBefore you watch this anime, please search and read the difference between S&M relationship and an abusive relationship - because there is a big difference.\r\nStory: 1/10\r\nWhat does this anime even want us to learn?\r\nThat it's okay to lie and let yourselfbe treated like an animal for the sake of getting along with your friends, because they will eventually like you?\\n\r\nThat it's okay to lie and let the man you love, humiliate you and treat you like an animal because he will eventually fall for you?\\n\r\nThat it's okay to endure everything because of love?\\n\r\nNo wonder there are so many women who choose to stay in an abusive relationship with the reasons: \" I love him, he will change somehow\" - or is this really what this anime wanted us to learn? - that it's okay to be treated like an animal and endure it all because they will eventually change and fall for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\r\nThe art okay is just okay. There were times when the anime looks dull but most of the time it's just okay.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nNot that really catchy for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nErika: The main character of this series - she is very very annoying, especially at the start of the series. There were lots of times when I really want to slap her just to make her back to her senses. I didn't see anything good about her character - first, she lied to her friends about having a boyfriend, took a picture of someone she doesn't even know and used it as a proof and lied about it to her friends just so, she have something to \"show off\". Then out of desperation to keep her lies: she agreed to become his \"pet\" - all because she was desperate to get along with her friends who obviously are no good for her. Then fell for the man who treated her like an animal and endured all of his abuses, simply because \"she loves him\"\\n\\n\r\nSata: At first, I thought he looked liked Gintoki (lol). He is your usual \"Handsome, popular but rude male lead who have a sad past\" - the author wanted to give him a sad past to justified his actions, but for me, that reason wasn't really bad enough for him to end up like that- for me, he is nothing but a weak and emo spoiled brat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1/10\\n\r\nEven though I am anemic, watching this anime made me feel like I am going to have a high blood pressure. The story is no good and the characters are pathetic and annoying. Some says that, this is like an S&M relationship, which I don't really agree with.\\n\\n",

            "content": "To begin, you should all know that I hate anime where the female protagonist bends over backwards to gather whatever crumbs of affection a cold, asshole of a male lead deigns to toss her way (I'm looking at you Itazura na Kiss).\r\nThat being said, there are exceptions to every rule; and I guess I found mine in Ookami Shoujo to Kuroouji. Part of my fondness for this anime could be that there seems to be a shoujo anime drought going on. But I digress, so without further ado, let me review.\r\nOokami Shoujo to Kuroouji is a twelve episode romcom and a predictably predictable shoujo formula.But I wouldn't say that it's a bad thing. \\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with an intro to our heroine Shinohara Erika. A typical bubbly and dense heroine who dreams of experiencing the fabled \"high school life\". A wrench is thrown into Erika's plans when she is separated from her best friend and they are placed in different classes. This is where Erika reveals a quirk that sets her apart from other shoujo heroines. \\n\r\nShe is a compulsive liar. In order to fit in with her classmates, Marin and Tezuka, with whom she has little in common, Erika makes up a boyfriend to give her something to talk about with them.\\n\r\nHer lie unfortunately only worked short-term. Her friends are beginning to sense the truth and Erika's cried wolf (or in this case, boyfriend) a little too loud, and a little too often to backtrack now. To reinforce her lie Erika takes a picture of a hot guy on the street and passes him off as her boyfriend. Too late, Erika finds out that the hot guy is actually a student at her school, Sata Kyouya. Erika asks him to pretend to be her boyfriend, thinking he will agree because he is such a prince, or whatever. And he does. On the condition that she be his dog.\\n\\n\r\nSo Sata-kun turns out to be an evil sadist and Erika his hapless victim, who inevitably falls in love with him because he was nice a couple times. And if the series continued on in this vein, this review would be a lot more scathing. It turns itself around at episode 6.\\n\\n\r\nErika does the usual thing where she \"works hard\" to win Kyouya's love but admits she gets tired when she does all the chasing with little reciprocation, and that she gets humiliated by him time and again. \\n\\n\r\nKyouya is a bit more complicated than your average male lead in that his popular, friendly personality is a complete lie. Later in the series one realizes his personality is more like that of a bitter, introverted loner (Hachiman Hikigaya, anyone?)\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of this show for me was seeing the two protagonists change because of their involvement with each other. Kyouya is less sadist and more tsundere. And it's adorable to watch him struggle to express his affection for Erika (which definitely becomes more apparent) and break through the barriers he's created to keep people at bay. Erika can be a little hard to take at times, but she was strong when it counted, and refreshingly forward. In the end I understood her determination to win Kyouya. After all, the bigger they are, the harder they fall. And it was supremely satisfying watching Kyouya fall. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in the show is clean with nice colour and is very, very shoujo.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was fine, not outstanding except for the punchy and unusual theme song. Sort of like a Japanese Avril Lavigne, I listened to it everytime, which is quite unusual for me. \\n\\n\r\nThis show had cringeworthy moments, but also had genuinely funny and sweet ones too. \\n\\n\r\nWhen you're suffering from drought, any refreshment is welcome, and Ookami Shoujo to Kuroouji quenched my thirst.",

            "content": "Ever heard of the phrase \u2018don\u2019t bite off more than you can chew?\u2019 Figuratively speaking, if you get a plain girl aiming for that dream guy, then that\u2019s more than what they can ask for. Meet Erika, the main female protagonist of this series who is exactly the plain girl. Then, we have the dream guy named Kyouya Sata. With those princely like looks, it\u2019s no wonder every girl wants to be his girlfriend. However, this show isn\u2019t about a perfect romantic get-away with these two. No, it\u2019s far from that. Wolf Girl (Erika) and Black Prince (Sata) unites two characters in a story ofdrama, abuse, and teenage youth by two complete opposite strangers.\\n\\n\r\nAs a standard shoujo series, Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji (Wolf Girl and Black Prince) is pretty generic from the get-go. It takes place in a school life setting where drama ensures. And judging by the ages of the characters, most of the girls seems to be interested in boys. No exception comes with Erika as she wants to a boyfriend, or at least someone to brag about. The funny part is that she ends up getting more than what she bargains for: Kyouya Sata. The first few episode depicts their awkward encounter that eventually gets her into a \u201crelationship\u201d with the guy. The quotation means that their relationship is fake although is used as a mask by Erika to prove her accomplishment of snatching the hottest guy at school. The picture isn\u2019t really pretty from behind the scenes though. Sata is more or less so the type of jerk where he cares about nothing but himself. Actually, his action implies himself as a sadist who rejects romance and wants Erika as her servant/dog. It\u2019s silly on the forefront and completely unexpected for someone like Erika. By some point, would you feel sorry for her? Perhaps but it\u2019s her problem to deal with now.\\n\\n\r\nThe series explains the problems that goes on between Erika and Sata. From the beginning, Erika must somehow always maintain the posture that they are dating as a couple rather than being labeled as frauds. Several instances throughout the series lands them in clich\u00e9 misunderstandings where their relationship become close to being jeopardized. While this is seen in many shoujo series, this anime goes into diehard mode to let the audience know exactly the type of person Sata is. At some point, you might genuinely feel sorry for Erika. However, there\u2019s also cases where we see a different side of Sata, one which we realize he might not be the bad boy he tries to be. Examples include situations where Erika gets into real trouble and Sata has to save the day. Also throughout the series, it\u2019s heavily implied that Sata develops real feelings for Erika and vice versa. As a controlling boyfriend though, Sata is one of those guys that is hard to please. Unfortunately, Erika is usually on the receiving end of punishments that lands her into even more trouble.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Erika herself, there\u2019s development for her character. At first, she often cares about what other people thinks and does anything to establish a reputation. Because let\u2019s face it, high school is about making an impact and youth really accelerates when you meet that special someone. Erika experiences this first hand later on when she realizes that special someone could actually be Sata. The question comes to matter is how far she is willing to go for Sata. At various times, she realizes that there may or may not be a way to change Sata. That isn\u2019t really the point anyways since the show focuses a lot more on their relationship rather than see who can change who. On an even more frustrating note, we don\u2019t really know much about Sata\u2019s past in regards to his background story. For a guy with such reputation at school, there\u2019s only very few that knows the real him.\\n\\n\r\nRelationships can be a nutshell when other characters gets involved. And like many other shoujo series, we do have side characters that complicates Erika and Sata\u2019s relationship. If the first two words that come to your mind are \u2018love rivals\u2019, then you are correct. As predictable as it can be, the show introduces both male and female characters as a seemingly way to test how Erika or Sata can cope when someone else asks them out. Characters introduced in the series ranges from shy loners to playboys. You can just imagine how this can influence their relationship when a misunderstanding between them can go out of hand. A problem with this is how the show neglects their relationship building but instead focuses on how they deal with it separately. Not only that but the comedy faded as well when certain situations become serious. Luckily, a good deal of the show has comedy, a factor that makes the series quite entertaining. There\u2019s no denying that there\u2019s comedy when it comes to this show whether it\u2019s be Sata\u2019s constant abuse or Erika\u2019s life. Still, when the story gets on the melancholic side with what it has built, then the series suffers from momentum. The plus side is that comedy is present in good doses throughout the series when there\u2019s opportunity. Timing is key and the show does nail that on most parts whether it\u2019d be Sata\u2019s taunts, zany imaginations, or anything you may see related in a couple who are nothing alike to each other.\\n\\n\r\nFor this particular shoujo series, the artwork would be labeled as average at best. The characters are designed with stereotypes with no particular character standing out above the others. Some noticeable features are probably Sata and his reactions that can strike as comedy gold. Otherwise, don\u2019t expect some high quality delivery from this series when it comes to artwork or visuals. The background, settings, and character designs is a bad joke itself with uninspired effort.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is more or less of an interest to take notice. I say this because of the character voice mannerisms, a trait that is actually quite important for the main characters. This is especially true for Sata as he hides his true character. I do give him some credit for his tone of voice when he is able to quickly shift between the prince charming to the controlling master. On the other hand, Erika can sound like a child at times when she complains. It gets tiresome and frustrating when the series continues to recycle her personality over and over to express it in audio scenarios. Otherwise, the OP and ED songs are amusing to watch not because of the lyrics but the coordination of the scenes. Like I mentioned before, comedy plays out a large part of this show\u2019s entertainment so those songs hit the right notes.\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji is like a test to see how far Sata and Erika will score as a couple by the end of the show. I don\u2019t mean it literally as this show\u2019s score but rather their relationship and its development. To say the least, it is a mixed bag with obstacles and challenges. However, the show knows its intentions and highlights that with plenty of opportunities to make the audience laugh. It may not be a stand-up comedy but the show has that enthralling grip when it does try. Just be aware that the show is nothing less than predictable, conventional, and saturated with the usual moments that may make you go \u2018been there, done that\u2019.\\n",

            "content": "Wolf Girl & Black Prince is a really sad excuse for a romance anime, doing for romantic comedy what Twilight did for teenage relationships and taking it a step further to S&M. \r\nWolf Girl & Black Prince is about Erika Shinohara, a 16-year-old girl who finds herself starting a new year of school, but is alienated from the other students because they have all formed their own cliques. In order to befriend two girls, she tells them about her romantic exploits with her boyfriend, despite the fact she has no boyfriend.\r\nShe claims that a handsome boy in a candid photo is her boyfriend, unaware thathe is her schoolmate, Kyouya Sata. In order to hide her lie, she asks him to keep her secret and he offers to become her fake boyfriend. Unfortunately for her, while Sata acts like a sweet person in public, he is actually a black-hearted sadist, and blackmails her into becoming his dog. \\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat, Wolf Girl is very bright and colorful, but the overall art is lacking, as most of the detail went into the male characters, mainly Kyouya, causing the others to pale in comparison. You'll notice that throughout the show the colors on Kyouya Sata just pop, but when the scene flips over to Erika, the same attention to detail is absent. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is barely sub-par and pretty average as far as shoujo anime go.  It's also too sharp of a contrast to the dark subject matter, and the opening theme feels like its trying to romanticize the story into something positive even though it isn't.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development-wise, there is some progression, though slow, with background on Kyouya to illuminate the viewers on why he's such a flaming douchebag. Yet again, a whole lot of focus on the male lead, which doesn't leave much room for the other characters to grow in the story. But several episodes in and the side characters make so few appearances they become generic plot devices anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire storyline is chock full of drama, with power play and S&M fleshed out across the whole series. Kyouya takes up almost all the limelight and character development, accounting for a huge chunk of each of the 12 installments. And because he's such convincing eye-candy, you don't notice you're wasting your life watching him hog screen time just so he can be an asshole to a teenage girl. \\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, Kyouya's entire personality detracts from his character, making him creepy and off-putting. His entire relationship with Erika from the beginning is founded on the basis for control, or put more simply, because he wants a dog he can order around. But that's about where things stop being funny. Kyouya's obsession with having power over her leads him to push the boundaries of what is acceptable, even going as far as to emotionally toy with Erika in increasingly cruel ways even when she bares her emotions to him.\\n\\n\r\nThis twisted rendition of a master/slave relationship ultimately personifies an abusive relationship and the death of feminism all in one series. If that was what the creators were going for, they hit two birds with one stone.\\n\\n\r\nBut seriously, who wants a heroine who just lets herself get walked all over and then comes back for more?\\n\\n\r\nWolf Girl & Black Prince tries to be lighthearted about the delicate subject matter, but its dark undertones make the whole relationship between Erika and Sata seem deeply disturbing. \\n\\n\r\nEven in light of the fact the anime tries to excuse Kyouya's behavior with his past, it doesn't do much in the way of rectifying all the torment he inflicted on Erika, nor does it convince me that all is okay. In the end, Kyouya's actions defy logic by bringing Erika closer instead of destroying their relationship. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, the one character is not Wolf Girl's only flaw. The amount of female subordination to boot is appalling. Erika Shinohara proves to be as dumb as she is naive, excusing Kyouya's abuse time and again and being bought with acts of fake kindness. \\n\\n\r\nSomewhere in the story line, a new love prospect opens up for Erika, but she opts out in favor of...you guessed it, Kyouya. \\n\\n\r\nUnbearably optimistic, Erika's seiyuu was bubbly and high-pitched to the point of inducing a headache. Kyouya's seiyuu on the other hand was impressive, but sadly not enough to lift this anime off the ground.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly wouldn't even recommend Wolf Girl & Black Prince, unless you're the type of person who likes watching S&M at its finest. This show calls itself a romance anime, but I was not feeling any love at all from this one.",

            "content": "Spoiler warning, just in case you didn't realize this was a shoujo anime:\r\nKyoya is an asshole. BUT ERIKA FALLS IN LOVE WITH HIM ANYWAY!!! I guess you figured this was coming, since it's a shoujo anime.\r\nI know that there's a cross-cultural divide between myself (American) and the story (Japanese), but in no way is it romantic to allow yourself to be abused the way Kyoya abuses Erika. Not to mention that even if he's only treating her badly because he doesn't care about her, what's to say that he'll stop treating her badly when he actually comes to love her. He basically doesn't stop treatingher badly, but he does stop treating her like a dog.\\n\\n\r\nAbuse, turn off number one. Even mild abuse is abuse. She should have walked away sooner, but I guess if she'd walked away, this anime wouldn't have happened and Kyoya would have just stayed the same as he was.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this story is pretty generic. What is it with girls in anime falling for assholes?? And then changing them???\\n\\n\r\nCan I just say: If you fall in love with someone who is not a great person, you are not going to change them. You're not going to change anyone you date, and this should not be your goal or mission, because you're the one who will end up hurt and changed.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the frankly obnoxious story, the art was decent. They did kind of interesting walking sequences. The sound was good. There was a variety of characters, but not much development as far as I could tell, except in Kyoya. But his development didn't make much sense to me, for reasons mentioned above.\\n\\n\r\nI struggled to enjoy the anime taking in to account that Kyoya's character development didn't make any sense.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I don't recommend this, unless you're bored.a",

            "content": "Demographics can be tricky thing to talk about when talking about anime. They aren't specific genres, but are more used for targeting specific groups of people. However, just because they are targeting a certain age group and/or gender doesn't mean those shows are limited to that group of people alone. But in Ookami Shoujo's case, I firmly believe it the vast majority of people who enjoy this show will be in the shoujo demographic, which is primarily why I found this show mediocre at best.\r\nThe shows first problem for me was came right off the bat. The basic premise of the show is Erika tryingto remain friends with two students by lying that she has a boyfriend, because that her two \"friends\" basically only talk about their boyfriends. The thing is, those friends are absolute assholes, and even tried to sabotage her \"relationship\" with Kyoya early on. If Erika was completely friendless, I could, at the very least, understand why she would want to be fake friends with them, but she already has a really good friend in Ayumi to begin with, so one of the major drawing points of the entire show just feels pointless and redundant to me. However, I can only help but feel like I can't understand Erika's plight simply because of the whole shoujo demographic thing, and that the whole premise might be much more relatable to actual teenage girls than to me. \\n\\n\r\nBut lets get into the real problem I have with this show. The whole relationship between Kyouya and Erika is more or less completely baseless, and it feels like the actions that led up to the end result made no sense. Kyoya treated Erika like trash, but for some reason, Erika falls in love with him. Kyoya did maybe 5 good things to Erika MAXIMUM throughout months and months of treating her like a dog, and Erika focused solely on those 5 good things that Kyoya did for her, and felt compelled to start an actual relationship with him.  The only real reason Erika and Kyoya got together was because the writers made it so. There was no rhyme or reason for it, no emotional connection, no nothing. Hell, Erika had a chance with this really nice kid, Kusakabe, who actually treated her like a human being, but she turned him down anyways because fuck logic.\\n\\n\r\nBut for all the bashing I have for this show, I'll give credit where credit is due. For once, an anime showcases a relationship that goes beyond the kiss scene, and shows Erika and Kyoya as a couple. Very few romance anime actually do this, and I did end up enjoying the last few episodes because of this. This doesn't make up for the fact that their relationship is based off of nothing, but I thought Erika and Kyoya were kind of cute together after they officially became a couple. Sure, this development kind of came out of nowhere, and Kyoya changed drastically personality wise (which is a big plus for his character, but didn't make much sense to me), but it at least made those last few episodes much more tolerable. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then, we have the supporting cast, which really didn't do much for me. Most of the supporting cast were either nice people, or just plain assholes, with the exception of maybe Nozomi. All the supporting: nice characters, assholes, , were pretty much one note archetypes, even if some of them are different than what we are normally used to. You have your lovable idiot, your playboy, your level-headed best friend, etc. Most of them were more fun to watch than Erika and Kyoya were (which isn't saying much), but they weren't much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound wise, there isn't much to say. The art is dull and uninspired, with not much detail throughout. The animation is choppy and framey. Hell, I could even point out some key frames that were left unfinished on the final episode, although that is just nitpicking. \\n\\n\r\nI can say the same thing about the sound that I can about the art, it was dull and uninspired. I don't even remember beat, any melody, or even if there were any insert songs because it was just that forgettable. The opening is notable only because it sounds like an Avril Lavigne pop song, but that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nIt's clear that I didn't like this show, but I can't say that it is necessarily bad, because the show wasn't made for teenage guys like me in mind. That being said, I don't know if I would recommend this show to a teenage girl either based on my experiences. Take this review with a grain of salt, because I bet there are some who would find the shit that I didn't like about the show actually compelling. As for me, I'm glad that this show is forever out of my mind, and I can go back to watching some more Monster or something.",

I'm not too fond of the abusive nature of the main male character Kyouya, and the weak-willed personality of the female main, Erika. Actually, I didn't care for any of the characters in this show. The \"teaching moments\" in this show felt really forced.\r\nKyouya was made be Tsundere character, but, really, this guys shows no change at all - he's just a jerk, and I don't thinkanyone would take his BS for that amount of time. No matter what, Kyouya treats Erika like she's a possession, and is not only controlling, but hurts her over an over again, and doesn't seem to care, and she just accepts it keeps taking the abuse.\\n\\n\r\nSure, love can do crazy things, but this is just too much to tolerate. Girls, women, females at any age do not enjoy being treated like that.\\n\\n\r\nI used to volunteer at women shelters, and I would see this kind of thing all the time. It was heart wrenching to see women who were abused both mentally and physically and still go back.\\n\\n\r\nI'm told that the manga gets better, but really, I just don't care to continue this, or explore it further. I'm sorry, I just cannot tolerate to watch the guy absolute torture this girl.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime sends a terrible message to young girls, and boys who think that young girls like this type of guy.

            "content": "Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji was a very up and down experience for me. It is, to some degree, a story about romance and acceptance, presented in a more comedic manner.\r\nStory - 6/10.\r\nThe story presented to us is a simple one. Our main character gets herself into a bit of a mess due to her compulsion to lie to gain friends, and this and that happens and she winds up with a frankly abhorrent guy who is essentially her 'owner'. A simple concept for a romance anime relatively well-executed, especially in the comedy aspect. Nothing ground-breaking, there was no real depth to the story, andany depth that was added into the story came off as a little shallow and contrived (for example, most of the flashbacks seemed to be trying to create a background just for the sake of it, as the story didn't really need much of it to be effective.)\\n\r\nMost of the 'story' really revolves around Erika and Kyoya and the way their relationship develops throughout the series, and as such it has no real resolution. It was also a little predictable at times.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10.\\n\r\nNot quite outstanding, but certainly worth a mention - the character designs were pretty consistent, the colours suited the mood the anime was trying to put across (for example the common bright colours seen in a comedy scene) and the backgrounds were nicely rendered. The characters weren't anything hugely unique, but at the same time they were very suited to the rom-com slice of life-ish genre, all looking relatively 'normal'.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10.\\n\r\nThe opening theme to the anime was fitting to the genre - quite cute and bouncy and generally fun. The voices were good, and the background noise fit well, especially in the comedic moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10.\\n\r\nAlthough the series really revolved around Kyoya and Erika and their relationship and relationships with others, the two main characters are what could have made or broken the series for me. At first they are presented as two pretty awful personalities, one being a compulsive liar (and a bad one at that) and subsequently a subservient wet leaf, the other being on a VERY high horse with some sort of superiority complex. The premise behind the series was that the two would get into their 'dog' and 'master' roles and as a consequence they would most likely end up changing one another. This did happen, though it took its sweet time (which is why the series was so up-and-down for me). Erika really comes across as a weak personality until about half-way through the series at which point you can really see her effect on Kyoya and how their relationship develops, and how she develops from a really un-likeable character to a quite sweet person.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10.\\n\r\nI couldn't enjoy this series as much as I would have liked simply because I felt it was quite slow to get started, although there were cute and funny moments I really couldn't stand the main characters and up until they started changing and affecting each other I was left pretty frustrated with them. The second half was an exception for me, although there were some feeble attempts at creating drama generally it was successful in portraying Erika and Kyoya's relationship with one another and the effect different situations had on them.\\n",

            "content": "Damn I gotta say this anime surprised me. \r\nSo today I decided to take a break from hajime no ippo and my rewatch of eyeshield 21 and watch a short anime that would be you know easy to watch and enjoyable. And one of the best animes for that in my oppinion are slice of life / school / comedy animes. So while searching for a comedy anime I randomly came across Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji...and I gotta say I really enjoyed it more than I expected to as it was very easy to watch. But enough small talk let's jump into the review.\r\nArt9 / 10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy this type of art and you could see the anime was made at a high quality. The characters were drawn as mostly generic / secondary characters but each one had a unique feature and you could easely tell them apart. The animation was fluid and smooth and really pleasant to the eye and damn Erika is sooo cute and Kyouya's eyes are epic.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is quite generic. I do like the intro but the soundtrack of the anime is nothing out of the ordinary. The voices for the characters are alright. Not too fancy but they are not bad either. I honestly really like Erika's voice because I think it furthers the idea that she is a cute fun girl not a \"hot\" one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are decent. They are nothing special though. You have this really funny (but also a very big and bad liar) protagonist girl (Erika) that is also a very sweet and nice person and you also got Kyouya who is kinda-of a sweet douchebag that turns into a somewhat nice guy by the end of the anime. The other characters are there but they are nothing too important since they episodic and just used to further the development of the 2 main characters Erika and Kyouya.\\n\\n\r\nStory 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOk before I rant a bit here is an explanation why the story is a bit lower for me. I felt the anime could have ended midway at 2 certain events (they kinda follow each other quite fast but I will refrain from talking about them since it might spoil the anime, though they are not hard to guess). \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the episodes felt a bit like useless fillers but they were enjoyable nontheless.(I know they wanted to show the characters actually grow and stuff still the anime would have been as enjoyable without them in my oppinion). \\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty generic MC1 falls for MC2 while MC2 is a tsundere type char (even though Kyouya is not that tsundere you get the point). The anime follows all the required steps in the story and has a solid one. If it was a bit shorter (let's say 10 episodes) the anime would probably have been 1 7/10 or maybe even 8/10. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason though I really enjoyed the anime. It was light-hearthed , somewhat funny and very easy to watch thus I went through it in one cold afternoon .\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime had charming MCs and their interactions were entertaining, it was light-hearthed , somewhat funny and very easy to watch and the art is really good.  I would recommend it to people who want an easy viewing while taking a break from more serious / longer animes.\\n",

            "content": "~generous note about how it's my first review and English isn't my native language~\r\nI'm not really good with writing this kind of things, so let's see how will it go.\r\n\"Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji\", also known as \"Wolf Girl and Black Prince\".\r\nThe story was told greatly. Nothing was missing. The great thing about it was that it isn't your typical shoujo/romance anime - it wasn't predictable and that's really what comes to liking. Although at the beginning I had problems with the romance/comedy that position has to offer - it's also not your usual humor (and romance) after all. The ending really satisfied me though.\r\nAsto art, I can't tell as a professional, because I'm none of that... although I really liked it. The characters' designs were great. Characters did not look similar.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuus' voices were matching perfectly. The background music was fitting and so I'll try to find the OST and listen to it. I particularly liked both OP/ED songs, they're catchy and may want to make you sing along.\\n\\n\r\nAs I stated before, this isn't your typical anime. This one tells a more realistic story. That also means the characters were more realistic, although I don't really know if you'd like to place yourself in the shoes of one of the main characters. I couldn't relate to any of the characters, but that didn't make me dislike them. The main characters actually grew throughout the series, which was great to look at. The supporting cast was hilarious in a good way. I'll definitely remember the characters in the future.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I think you'll enjoy this series, because... it shows some realistic things, which are surprising, but great nonetheless. Even if you're not a big fan of anime (or just these genres), you should definitely check this one out. I'll surely go back to the anime and start reading the manga. Also, I think re-watching will definitely add to the enjoyment. I'd love to own this series. The series was really memorable and unique in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nMoral of the story is: \\n\r\n~SPOILER~\\n\r\nDon't take pictures (or maybe do take them?) of random people and do not (?) try to pretend they're your second half.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nSociety can often exert pressures on everyday people, causing them to behave or act in a certain way. These may be small in scale, such as deciding what restaurant to eat at, or more grand, such as who to vote for in the next election. It's something that many people often experience, that inkling feeling of wanting to \"fit in.\" This is just as true in relation to love. People love others for fun, while some may find solace in establishing a meaningful connection. In Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji, these societal pressures and loving ideas are tested,giving us an okay little anime.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nOokami Shoujo follows Erika, a young high school girl who, finding herself without any friends in her new class, makes up a lie. This lie leads her to Kyouya, with the journey unfolding from there.\\n\\n\r\nFor Ookami Shoujo, it quite quickly sets up its overall \"format:\" introduce a side character, utilize him/her for a few episodes, progress Erika and Kyouya's relationship, and then repeat. It's simple, but often times it leads to the same repetitive character actions. Erika getting upset at Kyouya, the side character more or less not showing up ever again, and the relationship experiencing the same hurdles constantly are common within each mini-arc. This causes a bad association with often boring developments, because the audience knows exactly what to expect.\\n\\n\r\nWhat this one does right, though, is portraying or at least displaying such a couple. In anime, many romances revolve around the \"normal\" guy having the cute and kind girl fall for one another. Ookami Shoujo strays away from this. Instead, Kyouya is the goal, with Erika chasing after his coattails. In laymen's terms, it's the classic \"girls love bad guys\" idea. And it works. The reason for this comes from the perception that is created for Kyouya and Erika. His derisive remarks and her wavering emotions demonstrate how such an unlikely couple operates. While people may think that everyone in a loving relationship maintain traits of kindness, awareness, and respect, this one gives us a varied look at what it means to \"care\" for another person.\\n\\n\r\nThe show tries somewhat to present the idea that it's okay to just be yourself. There may exist a \"certain\" way to go about behaving, but learning to just be who you are (obviously, within reason) and not caving to such pressures makes life a much more rewarding experience. I say somewhat, because this direction is lost somewhere around halfway through the season, where it then begins to focus almost entirely on the romance. This is perhaps due in part to the character developments of the main cast. Opting for pure romance is fine, but since the earlier idea was first introduced, there needed to be some semblance of balance -- peer pressure and romance.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nOokami Shoujo sits in a rather strange spot.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is what I usually describe as \"soft.\" It most often exists within shoujo anime, where the locales and characters are given an aura about them that makes everything seem plain or natural. A good comparison would be to Kimi ni Todoke. With an average amount of detail, the show usually incorporates more flair and appeal during the comedy bits. Here, the anime defers to more goofy eyes and faces, shining backgrounds, and other fantastical tricks.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as character designs go, Kyouya is rather boring with his usual long-sleeve shirts and ruffled hair. Erika, however, sees many transformations from her hair to her outfits. Making more comparisons, while she doesn't hold the same allure, Erika's simple beauty reminded me greatly of Nanami from Kamisama Kiss.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual animation is somewhat lacking, mainly due to the nature of the show. That is, it's mostly just dialogue between the main couple or conversations existing between other classmates and side characters. The animation can pick up during the aforementioned comedic bits, though.\\n\\n\r\nIt also has a habit of doing this weird technique of having the characters speaking dialogue with just their portraits being shown in the foreground. This just adds to the argument that the animation within the anime is sometimes missing.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nOokami Shoujo actually contains an okay set of characters despite the underwhelming story.\\n\\n\r\nAs the star of the show, Erika is a nice young girl who is quick to be dishonest. Her \"true self\" causes her more trouble than it's worth, but she consistently makes it her mission to fabricate her life as much as possible. While she is quick to lie, when faced with hardship and reality, she is unusually emotional. While her initial relationship with Kyouya starts off as nothing more than a game, her feelings rapidly move from side girl to lover the more time she spends with him. Her ability to handle not only what Kyouya dishes out but also his rather hostile attitude makes her the seemingly perfect girl for him.\\n\\n\r\nKyouya's public persona paints him as a perfect prince. What hides beneath this kind mask he has created is a river filled with scorn, hatred, and just downright evil. At every opportunity that presents itself, he attempts to make Erika's life a living nightmare. He's actually incredibly standoffish and unbearably cruel. But in truth, this is just another of his masks. With Erika now in his life, what one finds behind his (many) shells is a young man filled with compassion and awareness.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a huge issue with his character, however. The anime attempted to expand upon why Kyouya acts the way he does, but it comes off as being insignificant due to its quick overview and extremely late inclusion. While his development from an intolerable brute to a slightly jerk-ish boyfriend was nice to see, his actual characterization lacks the depth that was constantly alluded to throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the side cast, while they are cast aside more literally than their title implies, what they do is try to propel Erika and Kyouya's relationship, and more specifically Kyouya, forward. Each mini-arc aims to add another crack to those shells of his, giving Erika the chance to crush them for good. This is accomplished by having Kyouya experience suppressed emotions: jealousy, happiness, and nervousness, to name a few. They're tiny actions, but they slowly build on one another, letting Kyouya go through the development that he does.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is okay. The vocalist, guitar, and drums work nicely in unison, with the singer being given the opportunity to showcase a decent amount of range.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED actually gets my vote as one of the best of the season. The strange ambient sound effects, the pinging, and the somewhat slow singing make it very fun to listen to on each and every playback.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is sadly not as good. The one track featuring a wavy trumpet and hanging triangle that played during certain sections was usually catchy, but everything else falls under the \"generic\" category.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, for voice acting, there are no notable performances to be had. At the minimum, Kanae Itou as Erika did somewhat above average.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI say it time and time again: romance is my go-to genre above all others. Watching Erika get flustered around Kyouya or Kyouya looking to protect his girlfriend from a potential jerk made me happy to see. Obviously there are other elements placed throughout, such as gift exchanges, pictures, and those all-important couple moments. And they all had their intended effect: making me smile.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is also pretty funny. Even though Kyouya is really cruel, Erika's reactions were always good for a laugh. The animation, as stated previously, also adds to the comedy. It does try to inject smaller dramatic moments, but these are overshadowed by the more hilarious and romantic ones, which was for the better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji is a simple romance story featuring a not-so-simple couple. While the plot may be missing, the characters involved at least try to make up for it. And if this anime teaches us anything, it's that not everyone should always be taken at face value.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, unique romance filled with repetition and unclear themes\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, \"soft\" art style, average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Erika is okay, Kyouya is good, side cast is okay\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, great ED, okay soundtrack, average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, nice romantic elements mixed with comedy\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "A pretty common complaint about romance anime is that the romance aspect \u2013 that is, the main attraction of the show \u2013 is slow to develop and the characters take an eternity to get together. Oftentimes, we have drama and comedy taking up screen time of what could be couples fawning over one another and going out on dates. To some people, that means that the bulk of a romance anime is filler, with the characters only getting together or confessing in the last few episodes \u2013 and sometimes, not even then! (Kimi ni Todoke, anyone?) Then came along Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji, wherethe main characters get together in the first episode \u2013 oh, no, wait, I'm mistaken. They're actually faking it. Sorry to get your hopes up! But wait, there's more. They do drop the faux couple act later on...it's just a matter of whether or not you'll have the patience to actually stick with it to the end. And I'm not promising you'll enjoy it, even if you do, for the simple fact that it takes some amount of distance to like this anime. \\n\\n\r\nShinohara Erika is a bit different from the usual shoujo main character. She's simple-minded and dense, true, but she also has an enormous yearning to fit in with her peers. Additionally, she's not afraid to tell a lie to do so. Erika wants to be accepted and loved so much that she is quick to fall head over heels for anyone who shows even the slightest bit of kindness to her. She's very gullible and very eager to please. That actually makes her a somewhat well-rounded protagonist; at least she's well-developed enough that she is believable and even understandable. I'm sure we all know someone who is a little (or a lot) like Erika in some ways. What is a bit less believable is her single-minded, almost self-destructive thirst to be accepted, but hey, there are people like that, too. \\n\\n\r\nSata Kyouya, on the other hand, adopts the persona of a \u201ckindhearted prince\u201d, when in reality he's a cold, sadistic individual. Calculating and observant, he's the sort that likes to know he has complete control of himself and his surroundings. He doesn't really understand emotions or romance, mainly because, as a child, a particular event caused him to become extremely closed off and reproachful of anyone who tried to get close to him. While it doesn't excuse his actions in any way, shape, or form, it definitely helps one understand his actions. There's almost nothing sadder than a home that lacks a mother, and that lack of presence is felt. Over the course of the anime, he becomes less of a cold bastard and more simply a reserved, introverted individual. In that regard, he's a bit original, even though he does display some tsundere traits.  \\n\\n\r\nSo, what brings this unlikely duo together? During the first day of high school, Erika meets two girls in her class. Desperate for friends, she nearly trips over her own two feet to integrate herself into their group. This entails being \u201cjust like them\u201d and having a boyfriend of her own. A few months into the semester, though, her newfound \u201cfriends\u201d are already beginning to smell her lie \u2013 especially since Erika doesn't have a single picture of her boyfriend to show them. One day, Erika sees a cute guy on the street and decides to take a picture of him, playing him off as her boyfriend. Only problem is that the guy she takes a picture of happens to be the \u201cprince\u201d of her school, Kyouya, and her friends recognize him almost immediately. This leaves her no choice but to ask Kyouya to pretend to be her boyfriend. He agrees, but for a price: she has to be his \u201cdog\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nI ought to be shaking my fist, right? I ought to loathe this anime along with the likes of Itazura na Kiss, Diabolik Lovers, and Mitsu x Mitsu Drops, right? Problem is, I don't. It takes a particular person to laugh at the jokes and humour in Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji, and a particular viewpoint, and if you fit neither, it's safe to say you'll hate this anime. However, this anime is a lot more tolerable than those of the same ilk \u2013 for one thing, Kyouya isn't a psychopath like Irie Naoki of ItaKiss. He's not doing the things he does because he genuinely wants to hurt her, he genuinely has no understanding of the fact that she's affected to the extent that she is. In fact, by the end of the anime, it's made pretty clear that he's trying his damned hardest to break down his own inner walls and inhibitions and be more affectionate to Erika. He just doesn't know how, darn it. I'm not the greatest at showing my emotions, either. I can hardly blame the guy. I'm betting he's an INTJ. We INTJs always have problems with those flimsy, abstract things. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm not excusing his actions, and if I were Erika's friend, I'd tell her to break it off with Kyouya. But Erika herself doesn't seem to want to. She's given multiple opportunities to break it off with him, and never takes them. Even when she's been separated from him for days, she still decides, of her own volition, to go back to him, because she still likes him no matter what he does. As she herself states, she likes him because of who he is, and changing even a single part of him wouldn't make him the same person anymore. If he makes her genuinely happy and he isn't forcing her to be with him, then who I am to judge? I certainly can't go about forcing my ideals on others. \\n\\n\r\nPlus, let's face it: not everyone's perfect, and not everyone is going to know exactly what's right and wrong to do in a relationship. The anime is basically the beginning of their adventure with something called \u201cdating\u201d, and forgive them if they don't know how to swim in deep water right away. Also, believe me: Kyouya's behaviour toward Erika gets a million times better in the manga, especially when you compare him to the first couple episodes of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nIf you don't have a sensitive skin and aren't the type to go social justice on everything, even the moments where Kyouya \u201cscolds\u201d Erika can actually be fairly amusing. At least, I found myself chuckling a few times upon my rewatch of the anime. In any case, there are times everyone has disagreements, and our main characters are no exception. Of interesting note is the fact that the anime brings up morals and conduct quite a bit, and really likes to pose the question of what is or isn't all right to do. Of course, one's mileage may vary, and the point of the matter is that there are different ways to approach love and romance, and making mistakes is fine so long as you realize what you're doing wrong and try to fix it. Neither Kyouya nor Erika are innocent in this regard. Erika, for her part, has a highly rose-coloured view of love, and Kyouya has a fairly negative impression of it. And Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji is what you get when those extremes clash. \\n\\n\r\nSince this is only a twelve episode anime, we don't have that many side characters. They are mainly Sanda Ayumi, Erika's best friend; Marin and Tezuka, the two girls Erika meets in her class; and Takeru, Kyouya's friend from the middle school era. Of course, there are other characters as well, but they hardly get enough screen time or development to be considered truly important. A couple are only introduced for one episode and then forgotten. That being said, that doesn't mean the other characters develop at all. They're static. Marin and Tezuka are introduced as two girls who constantly talk about their boyfriends, and that's who they are in the end. Sanda relentlessly offers Erika advice and informs her that she is a masochist for putting up with Kyouya's behaviour \u2013 that doesn't change, either. Takeru is introduced as a guy full of a manly sense of justice, and he doesn't change one bit. That doesn't meant they're bad characters, though, since the majority of the character development comes from Erika and Kyouya. Mostly Kyouya. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is a vaguely catchy number by SpecialThanks, called LOVE GOOD TIME. The vocalist has a somewhat slurry, \u201crock and roll princess\u201d sort of accent that immediately reminds me of Full Moon wo Sagashite's openings (both of which are by THE*SCANTY). The song itself is rather upbeat, but not necessarily memorable, apart from the singer's voice. The ending is Ookami Heart, sung by Oresama. It's pretty average stuff as well. The whole soundtrack is just quite mediocre; while I didn't notice any overly obvious usage of repeated tracks, there were several moments where I found myself thinking, \u201coh, this sounds just like a theme I heard in ___\u201d. In short, while the music isn't extravagant, it does its job just fine. The Japanese voice actors are pretty good. They really fit with the characters they were meant to represent. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is nice and clean. Typical shoujo fare, really. The guys are good-looking and the girls are cute. Sparkles and bubbles abound. When the animation isn't focused on those, it's pretty fluid. TYO Animations does a pretty good job! Thankfully, there isn't a surplus of chibi/super-deformed segments, which jives just right with me, since I'm not usually overly fond of those. One interesting thing to note is that Ookami Shoujo tends to animate talking heads over backgrounds during extended character interaction scenes. By that I mean, if two characters are sitting at a table and talking, often, the \u201ccamera\u201d will display a wide, blurry shot of the scene, and the busts of the characters will be added over top. Something similar is done with extended walking or travel scenes; just the legs of the character in question are shown while the scenery changes. Just something I noticed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, while Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji definitely can provide entertainment, laughs, and \u201cthe feels\u201d, it's definitely not for everyone. Kyouya's initial behaviour most certainly comes across as overly brusque at first. Take it from someone who was agonizing for hours over why she thought Ookami Shoujo was all right, though: he does get better, a lot better. As does the anime. Episode 8 and up ought to be pretty easy to get through, in fact, especially episode 10, which is probably my favourite, and really recommended if you want to see how tolerable the anime gets as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Watch at your own risk and don't be afraid to leave your overly quick conclusions at the door.",

            "content": "I have to admit I have a certain something against shoujo, and this show reminds me why. It's so... generic. So generic in fact I have difficulty thinking what exactly to review. Unpopular, average girl is paired up with the school idol due to certain circumstances... what's not to love...?\r\nThe main character, Erika, is easily dismissed as another generic female lead. She has absolutely nothing to distinguish her--save her tendencies to lie, and I got to admit she has a sort of talent to it if she can keep up with the other two girls she hangs out with. I find her to be fairlyshallow, however, as she doesn't seem to mind having fake friends as long as she isn't alone, tends to dismiss her only actual friend, and made a certain remark about loners being losers that made me dislike her from the start.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, fine, that last one was personal.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast doesn't get any better. Kyouya is another hot dude with temper issues and who can come off as a jerkass, but has a hidden nice side usually revealed by petting cats, or in this case dogs. Oh, and bonus points for having a dark past. \\n\\n\r\nThe closest thing resembling an original character is Erika's friend, you see, and I can't even remember her name. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is okay-ish, nothing that stands out, sound is fairly generic. The story is... well, what story? So Kyouya covers Erika's lies and pretends to be his boyfriend while torturing her mercilessly in secret? And that's about it. The rest are overused devices such as the sick episode or the Declaration of Protection. And let's not forget about the main lead soothing the broody guy's heart and making him fall for her. Please.\\n\\n\r\nA highlight is the comedy. It legit made me laugh and the dynamics between characters weren't terrible. I actually kind of liked Kyouya, maybe because he tortured Erika, whom I despise, and I'm rather fond of the trolling type of people.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's... well. Just an anime swimming in the middle of mediocrity, relying solely on wish-fulfillment, a hot guy, and maybe some comedic value to be popular. Definitely not something that will make you think, but then again anime like these come in handy when all we want is to get out of reality.",

            "content": "It's a shame I feel such a desperate need to review this show, such desperation I'm willing to lose my review virginity for it. But rather than offering a critique, I'd like to address how this became the first show (after years of continuous anime watching), that I truly believe no one should ever watch. \r\nJust so my inevitable bias is clear, my core evaluation of a show is its story. Not necessarily the execution of story-telling, but it must have the basic idea of what its story is and how to navigate us through it to achieve its purpose. That being said, a kindergartneris capable of telling a story as simple as \"A man fell in a hole and then got up .\" Yes, this is an incredibly dumb story, its more of a statement than a story, but yet, its still better than Wolf Girl and Black Prince. \\n\\n\r\n(This will spoil the show, but it will save you from watching it, so don't mind)\\n\\n\r\nWolf Girl and Black Prince - literally translated by the anime into Liar Girl and Sadistic Hot Guy, follows the story of Erika, a girl who lies about dating hot guy Kyouya; the most mentally abusive male MC in Shoujo's- correction: anime's history. Yes, even worse than Asta. Our story revolves around hot guy Kyouya verbally abusing, threatening, and manipulating Erika's emotions to the point where he jokingly offers to buy her (his dog, which she herself accepts as being) a collar and a leash for Christmas, she is so grateful for his kind offer its the happiest we see her the entire show. This abuse climaxes soon after when Erika finally steps up and requests Kyouya to reciprocate to her feelings, which contrary to what you may expect, he does. He lets her know how its all been a tease, how he truly loves her and never meant to hurt her. Only to moments later shatter this by self-retorting (and I take a small liberty in translation for clarity sake):  \"I would never say anything like that moron, go fuck yourself\". Erika (thankfully) responds correctly by dumping water all over him. \\n\\n\r\nThey make up next episode, don't worry. BUT WAIT! They actually break up the next-next episode after Erika overhears our new main-man, the savior, the light to amend this disgusting relationship- Yuu, question Kyouya about his true feelings, which receives the appropriate response: \"She just my play-thing\" -Kyouka. Erika, hearing all this, lets Yuu know he's got a chance. After an episode or two of Yuu being kind and cheerful, making sure Erika is recovering from her abusive relationship, Erika decides she misses being called a dog and friend-zones him. Returning to Kyouko (and I'm not kidding) 10 seconds later. \\n\\n\r\nPause. So far Erika dealt with 3 men, the second I won't bother naming. hot guy Kyouko- who she had no interest in, and he just wanted someone to bully. Hot guy #2- Another playboy who protecced her and instantaneously asked her out knowing she had a boyfriend. After Erika gladly accepts and falls for him, letting him know Kyouko isn't a real boyfriend, he rejects her saying \"I just wanted to steal Kyouko-san's girl, who are you?\" -#2. Now here comes our boy Yuu- they have chemistry from the get-go. Erika notices him albeit his timidness and they have the first (and only) none-cringe male to female conversation in this show. He humbly admits he isn't as attractive and Kyouko, but with him she'll be respected, happy, cared-for, anything is better than being called someone's bitch... right? The only romance that ACTUALLY sprouted from \"normal\" love got shutdown so fast Erika fetching a stick for Kyouko lasted longer (Again, not joking). This is where I dropped.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was a smidgen of decent story telling I would've stuck along just get it over with, but the foreshadowing, pacing, character development, humor, the decisions, their thoughts, their actions, the FUCKING GOAL of the story were all so miserable I felt watching any further will result in irreversible brain damage. I kept blindly believing there must be some light at the end of this dark dark journey, but it just kept getting darker. I don't need to watch the rest to know Erika will be called a dog for the rest of her life and they'll live happily ever after- I watched half the show and this relationship was so forced down your throat there was nothing to look forward to. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a story of an abusive relationship being displayed with shiny lights- letting all the innocent teenage girl viewers know no matter how good of a guy you find, if he isn't the hottest human being you know, he isn't good enough. And if you somehow get this god-tier attractive boyfriend, no matter what he does to you, \"you can't help who you fall for\", so get used to his abuse, his awful personality, and likely cheating, and smile through it. This anime feeds on teenage girls thirst for being popular rather than a good romance, and keeps them on edge through use of the worst \"plot twists\" I have seen, half the plot twists are by definition abuse. \\n\\n\r\nI have watched many similar shows, and this by miles on miles on miles the worst thing I've ever seen from anime. -1/10. I don't doubt many young viewers had an 'attractiveness over anything' shoved into their beliefs because of this. This is a disservice to society.",

            "content": "If you were to go and browse my manga list, you would know that I read a lot of shoujo stories. As somebody who is no stranger to shoujo series, I am aware of their frequent portrayals of unhealthy and abusive relationships, which they oftentimes fail to frame for what they are: absolutely disgusting. Certain gross behaviors of the male love interest may be acknowledged as wrong, but those instances are often few and far between. Even worse, many times these abusive behaviors are framed to be interpreted as \u201cromantic\u201d or \u201cendearing\u201d. Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji is one of these types of stories, whichis why I absolutely despised it. \\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: I love shoujo series. There\u2019s a reason why my manga list is loaded with that sort of thing, and I try to keep in mind that shoujo stories are just fun, romantic escapist fantasies for young women. They don\u2019t have to be totally realistic, and many shoujo series that I actively enjoy don\u2019t have perfectly healthy relationships, but this series featured such a detestable main couple that it was never able to win me over. Also, just because I enjoy something doesn\u2019t mean I shouldn\u2019t acknowledge some of its more unsavory aspects. With that out of the way, let\u2019s get on with the review.\\n\\n\r\nThe story for this anime centers around Shinohara Erika, a 16 year old high school girl with a seeming inability to stop telling fibs that get her into trouble. From the get go, this is shown to be Erika\u2019s greatest weakness (and what would inevitably be the catalyst for even greater conflict later on in the show), as only a few minutes into the first episode, she tells a fib to a bunch of children, while trekking to school with her friend, about how she\u2019s a pro soccer player, which leads to her breaking a window after kicking the ball into the air. After the soccer fiasco, she makes it to school, where she doesn\u2019t have class with her best friend, and everybody else seems to already be in their respective groups. She eventually takes notice of two girls talking about their boyfriends and sex life, and our desperate heroine sees this as an opening to lie about her nonexistent boyfriend/sex life, in hopes that she would catch their attention and become their friend. She succeeds, and they talk for awhile, until they eventually start to catch on to her lies. Erica realizes this, and starts brainstorming ideas about keeping up appearances on her way home from school one day. Upon overhearing two women commenting on a guy\u2019s handsome appearance, she looks up to notice the guy she they were talking about. Thinking about how great it would be if he was only her boyfriend, she snaps a picture of him very closely and without his consent. Once she\u2019s caught by him, she runs away, hoping never to run into him again. Unfortunately for her, he goes to her school, and he\u2019s the extremely popular and well-liked \u201cprince\u201d, Sata Kyouya. This causes Erika to fall even deeper into the hole that she dug for herself. In an attempt to keep her lie going with her new freinds, she confesses what happened to Kyouya, hoping he\u2019ll understand and keep up the lie with her. He agrees to pretend to be her boyfriend, but only if she would be his \u201cdog\u201d, somebody who he could throw around and have bend to his will. \\n\\n\r\nTheir relationship already starts under abhorrent circumstances, but the events that ensue as she genuinely starts to fall in love with him and tries to desperately win him over made me feel an array of negative emotions ranging from deep sadness to extreme rage. He regularly screws with her already fragile emotions, uses her for his own gain (obvious given the circumstances of their relationship), and is just an all around cold, abusive asshole. When he isn\u2019t being cold towards her, his behavior is regularly aggressive, and that\u2019s usually during the moments where the show wrongly portrays their relationship as \u201cromantic\u201d. I guess when he tends to be cold towards her, aggression just seems \u201cwarm\u201d in contrast. The most rage-inducing moment in the show would have to be in episode 5, when Erika and Kyouya sit in a restaurant together after school, where she openly expresses wanting to go on a Christmas date with him. He responds by finally telling her that he loves her, saying that he would happily go on the date. After a constant relationship of cold, aggressive, and abusive mixed signals, she finally had her answer. He loved her, and she was overjoyed. However, that wasn\u2019t the case. After confessing his seemingly genuine feelings to her, he then snorts, saying it was all a lie, and telling her that she was stupid for getting her hopes up. After constantly tearing her apart emotionally, he gave her a glimmer of hope, and then tore that apart too. In one of the most cathartic moments in all of anime, she tearfully splashes the water she was drinking in his face, calling him \u201cgarbage\u201d. Once Christmas comes along, she sits in her room, alone. Despite the way he had treated her, she still loved him, and it was hard to let him go. Suddenly, she heard a knock on the door, and it was Kyouya. He ends up bursting into her room, deriding her for daring to call him \u201cgarbage\u201d (even though he did act like TOTAL garbage), and then proceeds to present her with a silver necklace, saying it\u2019s her \u201ccollar\u201d, and a sign that she \u201cbelongs to him.\u201d All of this was done aggressively (although my description of the scene should have made that obvious) and I think the way he treated her at the restaurant vs. the way he treated her on Christmas is the best part of the show that I can use to describe the cold/aggressive dichotomy that Kyouya displays. One second he has no interest at all and intentionally tears her down to make it seems like he doesn\u2019t like her, and then the next thing you know, he\u2019s at her house on Christmas and angrily presenting her with a \u201ccollar\u201d because she \u201cbelongs to him\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nAfter he presents her with the necklace, she breaks down crying. I think the show was trying to portray her crying as \u201ctears of happiness\u201d, and wanted the audience to believe that Kyouya\u2019s gesture was romantic. Instead, I just felt depressed. All I saw in that scene was a girl\u2019s mental state breaking down because she was confused, abused, and didn\u2019t know what to think anymore. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m sure it wouldn\u2019t be hard to guess that Kyouya\u2019s actions are explained through his \u201ctragic past\u201d. It may have been true that Kyouya was cold towards her because he was afraid of attachment and making a genuine romantic connection, which was In turn due to his general fear of abandonment and worry that those who he loved would leave him, but it doesn\u2019t justify his actions towards Erika. Sure, it may make his character just a bit more sympathetic, but not by much. He does become slightly more tolerable by the end of the series, but since he\u2019s still an abrasive asshole by that point, I can\u2019t say that I ever grew to like him. Overall, the story and the main couple in this show (you know, the protagonists who we\u2019re supposed to root for) were so painful to watch that I couldn\u2019t ever give this series a positive score.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation both look standard for a 2014 shoujo anime. It\u2019s average and nothing phenomenal. The music, on the other hand, is pretty great. The opening theme is a fun and catchy little J-Pop tune, and the ending theme is more of the same, but both songs sound above average, to be sure (although that just might be my taste in music speaking). Ookami Heart, the ending theme, is the better song of the two, and I highly suggest you go watch the music video for it. Its got a fun, bright retro aesthetic, and all 3 minutes of it is 100 times better than every episode of this anime combined! This song is seriously the only reason I gave this show a 2/10.\\n\\n\r\nOokami to Shoujo to Kuro Ouji is one of the most infuriating pieces of media I\u2019ve ever consumed. Even as a die-hard shoujo fanatic, I really can\u2019t recommend this to anyone at all. This show hurt to watch, and for your sanity, I\u2019d recommend that you stay away from this anime.",

Everything, apparently. Once again I run into a show that abuses cliches to no end. Another show whose potential was wasted with convenient plot devices and little to no character development. I swear to god, the main heroine is a fucking shallow piece of shit. I don't know much about her other than the fact that she falls in love with anyone who does a nice thing to her. As a guy, I hope no girls are likethis, otherwise, they, just like the heroine of this show, will be played over and over and over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters and their development in this story is basically nonexistent. Plot devices. :/\\n\\n\r\nThe heroine? Fuck, what was her name again? The only thing I remember her being called was a dog. Shows how memorable she is, right?\\n\\n\r\nI think I might drop this show. I honestly don't know how much more I can take of an asshole guy and his trusty sidekick, a girl with one of the most annoying personalities of any show I've seen. Watch this show if you're just really bored and can't find anything else to watch. If you're expecting comedy, don't even bother. You'll just be met with slapstick humor that gets really dull after the second episode.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: In the end, I did end up dropping it. Lol.",

            "content": "Ok, after watching 7 episodes of this show I dropped it in pure disgust. For some reason I had the idea that \"Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji\" would be simiular to \"Class president is a Maid!\" (which I  loved), but boy was wrong. Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji made me feel at such unease that I felt compelled to write a review about why I disliked it so much. This review may contain minor spoliers to exemplify my grave distaste of the show. So let\u00b4s begin.\r\nStory: 1/10\r\nThe storyline of \"Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji\" are how the girl Erika is trying to fit inin a group of superfical girls at high school, and makes up a story that she has a boyfriend. The boy in question is the schools hottie (Sata) that every girl at the school drowls over. Sata agrees to play along with Erikas lie for his own reasons (basically to use her as a slave to do whatever he wants her to do, to satisfy his own dark needs). Sounds a little bit intresting right? But it soon turns out to by pathetic story about a girl with no other desire then the to make the cruel and cold boy to love her, and does anything to get his love. It comes to the point that Erikas highlight of the week is that she\u00b4s getting a pet on the head because she was a good dog and fetched whatever it was he wanted (it\u00b4s actually is illustrated by Erika with ears and a wiggeling tail). It gave my gag reflexes. But hey, the poor Sata had a childhood experince that made him sadstic and cruel so it\u00b4s ok right? I actually found myself screaming at Erika that, yes, you are stupied and have no selfrespect or selfesteam at all. Even the comedy became a place for Erika to further humiliate herself.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe only good thing about the show. Cant blame decent art for the catastrophic story. The characters are nicley drawn and the backgrounds fill their purpuse (to be the stage of this \"love\" story). \\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nCan\u00b4t remember so much of the music due to my horror of how the show played out. OP was ok but that nothing that stood out. Otherwise voice acting was fine but nothing I could appriciate. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\r\nI have all ready been talking about the characters a bit due to that the story pretty much only are character based. But I will elaborate a bit more.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we have Erika, your average high school girl whos only worries is to fit in and not be lonely at high school. Nothing wrong with that but it\u00b4s more important to her to fit in than get actual friends (even do she has ha great best friend, Sanda). Later on the only thing in the world that\u00b4s important to Erika is to upgrade from dog to girlfriend status to Sata. She is also a pathological liar whom later gives the advice to others \"to be true to them selfs\". Otherwise I really cant say much about her, because her whole beeing centers aorund Sata. Yes, didn\u00b4t finish the show so I can\u00b4t tell if there are any major character development for Erika, but I dout that. Once a masochist always a masochist. \\n\\n\r\nThen we have Sata... Yes, he is very good looking and appears to others as a gentleman but his true colors are really dark. He clearly enjoys to make others feel small and useless. He actually gets seroius kicks of making Erika run for sticks like a dog and do other humiliating things. Sata is also very controlling which screams \"psychopath\" long way. He doesnt use words like love, but states that things (oh I meen Erika) belongs to him. He actually claimed once in the show \"that he didn\u00b4t liked that a guy made Erika cry for now good reason, because she belonged to him\". But he himself makes Erika cry like 5 times each episode. He creeped me out.\\n\\n\r\nCan\u00b4t really say anything good or bad about the supporting crew, which only function seems to be contribute to the MC\u00b4s \"love\" story in some way. We have the best friends that give advices and listens to the MC\u00b4s complains, the guys whos function is to make Sata jealues and a superfical girls group which competes for \"I have the best boyfriend and best relationship\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nAbsolutly no enjoyment for me. Episode 1 gave some potentail to a bit wierd but intresting story but falls all ready in epsiode 2 for me.. After that I was just horrified.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\r\nThe only thing that makes me give it a 2 instead of 1 is the art, which was pretty good. It gives me nightmares that young girls watch this and starts idolize cruel psycho dudes whos only attributes is good looks and if you \"hang\" in there long enough and do whatever he wants he will some day love you.",

The beginning was very interesting, seeing Sata and Shinohara getting to know each other, and dealing with Sata's demanding and ownership towards Shinohara. It was quite an adventure. I would totally watch this again.\r\n[ART]\r\n-----------\r\nThe effort the producers put into the graphics in this anime must've been very rough, in a good way of course. The quality of this anime was very high quality, and I loved it. Everything was well created, especially the nature and scenery.\r\n[SOUND]\r\n-----------\r\nI'm not sure if there is a dubbed version for this anime, but the subbed version was fantastic! Sata's voice actor did a very fantasticjob of showing his true colors. His demanding tone really set a very dark and mysterious vibe in this anime.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nThe only characters I found well animated and created was Sata and Nozomi. Every other character in this anime didn't really suit their personality. \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nI really did enjoy this anime. Seeing Sata and Shinohara's rough situations, and seeing them get off and on relationships with each other was sure an adventure. I think a lot of people who have relationship problems can learn a lot from this anime, of course, this is only an opinion. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was very well made, but it wasn't perfect. Every anime has it's downsides. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE:\\n\r\n9/10 for red eyed Sata",

            "content": "Before watching this show, I'd recommend you Wiki-up on the term known as \"Stockholm syndrome\". It will help you understand the ultimate wrong aspect of this anime far better, but, unfortunately, it still won't ease the fact that this anime is completely and utterly average. \r\nThe story is really simple and there isn't much to it: the girl joins high school, wants to make friends, lies to them about having a boyfriend, turns out that her made-up boyfriend goes to same school with her and is quite popular, he for some reason agrees to go along with her charade and then their adventures begin. Ican't say much for the story because there isn't any really. As a mainly character-driven series, the story is put-off into the sidelines and has trouble pacing itself over the episodes. At times, the episodes skip months worth of content they could show, and, for some reason, literally nothing seemed to have changed. I won't detail it out because it might be a spoiler, but you'll understand, trust me. The reason I gave the story such a low score is that even what's there isn't that good. It's predictable and filled with cliches and doesn't really work as a whole on any level. \\n\\n\r\nProduction of the show is its strongest part, alongside the comedy, and is quite eye-catchy. Especially for girl viewers. Even though there are some cute girls, most of them are not really THAT cute, while most of the guys that are important are made out to be quite hot - hence, extremely impossible to relate to just off the basis of the art. Animation hinges on the simplicity of movement and not much else and the series as a whole doesn't really have any heavy scenes when it comes to either art or sound. Speaking of sound, I had a really hard time hearing any music during this anime. For some reason, nothing stuck out and for the most part I didn't even bother looking for it. Voice actors did their jobs decently, but nothing really spectacular there either.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I expect you have looked up what I asked you to, so I can continue with my depiction of the characters in this show. We have Erika, our main girl, who desperately wants to fit in into high school and lies through her teeth to do so. I can relate to that and, probably, most people who've gone through high school can. What differs us, normal humans, from her is simply how far she's willing to push her lie. It goes bounds and leaps beyond what any sane human, who isn't riddle with any mental illness, would do. While the show puts it all on \"extreme masochism\", it's not. It can't be. You can't give such a vague attribute to your character and expect all her actions to make sense. Regardless of what Sato did to her, she came running back. Regardless of how much he'd hurt her, she came running back. It's not masochism - not even a form of it. It can be only explained as a complete and utter mental illness and, to be honest, show should have been about her going to the shrink and fixing it. Aside from that trait, she's not that interesting to watch. She's kind of likable, I guess,  and is shown to be a pathological liar although I'm pretty sure that whoever wrote this story really shouldn't attribute any mental illnesses to his/hers characters ever again because they have no basic idea what they are.\\n\\n\r\nNext up we have Sata, extreme version of male-tsundere. I'm going to say it upfront: nobody will ever relate to this character. And if you do, you are a horrible human being and you should know it. He lacks any likable traits, and I'd be fine with that if those unlikable traits were realistic. He's also showcased as sadist, but, again, I'm pretty sure that whoever wrote this doesn't understand what that means. He often says that he doesn't do it because he likes to, but still does it, which kind of contradicts the entire premise of the sadist. Instead, 90% of the things he says are intended to hurt the other party, and not in a sarcastic and funny way. Calling someone a dog over and over and over again, shunning the other people's emotions, dragging them along, doing things that go far beyond simple bullying - that's the kind of character Sata is. \\n\\n\r\n[MINOR SPOILER]\\n\r\nThere's a certain scene midway through the anime where Erika and Sata are sitting alone in a coffee shop and she asks him what he thinks of her. He then proceeds to tell her how much he likes her and turns it over by the end. Her reaction is okay, I guess, but what's the point of this is that it really showcased just how shallow, uninteresting and borderline insane character Sata is.\\n\r\n[/MINOR SPOILER END]\\n\\n\r\nThis goes for the majority of the characters: all of them (aside from 1 or 2 maybe) seem to be suffering from some sort of a pathological illness, or they're just really, really, really stupid. I won't describe any more because they aren't really worth the page. \\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy the anime? Relatively, to be honest, hence this high of a score for all the bashing. Humor, for the most part, was well done and the show did make me laugh out loud a couple of times, but that was about it. Romance is shallow, insane and simply unrealistic, and the 'drama' moments are worth less than those of Clannad. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, unless you just want to fill your list with rom-coms, I'd stay away from this. Especially if you're looking for likable and relate-able characters.",

            "content": "A desire for acceptance is something that most of us can relate to, and at times that can drive us to certain extremes. It's a premise that is not necessarily unique, but for a shoujo series it actually is. The cliched trope of a spineless heroine and her tsundere love interest is all too common. However this series provides us with a slight variant; our main character is a compulsive liar with a penchant for emotional punishment (read: she's a masochist) that happens to, in a series of poor decisions and bad judgment, land herself a two-faced jerk who is content to treat her likea dog.\\n\\n\r\nOriginality is not this anime's forte, per se, but it is successful as a romantic comedy because it is uncommon. The two main leads seem initially very unlikeable, but if you accept the fact that they mutually (consensually) engage in something of a sadomasochistic relationship\u2014that neither one seems to want to disband even when given the chance\u2014then the series provides some amusing comedy.\\n\\n\r\nErika is not your traditional shoujo heroine, she's actually a plucky, resilient lead who for reasons unbeknownst to most viewers, seems to enjoy Kyouya's treatment. When situations arise that would stereotypically end in an angst-filled fight between our couple, Erika maintains her usual headstrong, blind determination to win over her ice-hearted prince. She does actually develop as the series progresses, because initially his treatment of her does seem to bring her spirits down, yet she rather quickly begins to learn just how Kyouya works and how outwardly dishonest he is\u2014and she adapts.\\n\\n\r\nKyouya is perhaps less impressive on the face of things, but the amusing reality is that he's not like your traditional tsundere love interest in that he doesn't have much in the way of redeeming qualities. He is, quite frankly, a jerk to Erika constantly and only occasionally showers her with some vague form of affection. But the series doesn't try too hard to redeem him\u2014he has no sad backstory to fall on, as he says himself. His behavior is not entirely without cause, given the influence of his older sister. Being cynical and misanthropic seems to run in the family.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is entertaining albeit peripheral, and they receive minimal attention or development. That is a disappointing fact about the series, which was limited in how much screen time it could offer them given its short runtime. But for their part in the series, they did contribute to the development of the main couple and to the overall humor of their antics.\\n\\n\r\nFor the part of the plot, there is nothing original in the least\u2014it is the traditional shoujo setup from the beginning until the end. What pulls it off in a unique way is the characters that are seemingly cliche but vary quite drastically from any traditional leads in a romance series. They carry the series where the plot might otherwise flop for not being terribly thought provoking or entertaining. It's the same old setup, but delivered in a way that can still rouse some amusement because the way everything plays out seems bland at first but the spice of the characters bring it some flavor.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the animation, the color palette is vibrant and charming. In comparison to the manga, it actually has adapted all of the character designs quite nicely and all of the scenes have at least done justice to or provided some improvement on their counterpart. Although it is like any other shoujo style, each design is unique and rather fitting giving each character's unique persona.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately another weak area is perhaps the soundtrack. The opening is catchy and adorable, but during the course of the series there are a few scenes with background music that just seem utterly out of place in an almost comedic sense. In general, the series doesn't suffer too much in this category\u2014at least not too noticeably, but it does lack the ability to match its own mood properly at certain moments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the series has enough merits to warrant it being a good shoujo anime. Although this review may lead you to believe that the main characters are the most redeeming part of the series, it would be disingenuous to claim they aren't the least bit frustrating. If you have difficulty appreciating that they are more nuanced than they seem at first glance, then you will be hard pressed to find anything enjoyable about the series. This certainly is not for everyone, it's not about a sweet couple that fall in love gradually\u2014it's about two characters who are so entirely human that they are flawed and utterly unlikeable, but as a result of which, happen to be highly entertaining together.",

            "content": "I read the manga version few years ago but dropped it eventually because of how annoying the characters were - especially Erika.\r\nI was actually surprised that it was adapted into anime. One day, I saw a video on youtube for \"top best shoujo anime of all time\" and this anime was included, so I decided to give it a try, which I regretted A LOT.\r\nBefore you watch this anime, please search and read the difference between S&M relationship and an abusive relationship - because there is a big difference.\r\nStory: 1/10\r\nWhat does this anime even want us to learn?\r\nThat it's okay to lie and let yourselfbe treated like an animal for the sake of getting along with your friends, because they will eventually like you?\\n\r\nThat it's okay to lie and let the man you love, humiliate you and treat you like an animal because he will eventually fall for you?\\n\r\nThat it's okay to endure everything because of love?\\n\r\nNo wonder there are so many women who choose to stay in an abusive relationship with the reasons: \" I love him, he will change somehow\" - or is this really what this anime wanted us to learn? - that it's okay to be treated like an animal and endure it all because they will eventually change and fall for you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\r\nThe art okay is just okay. There were times when the anime looks dull but most of the time it's just okay.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\r\nNot that really catchy for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nErika: The main character of this series - she is very very annoying, especially at the start of the series. There were lots of times when I really want to slap her just to make her back to her senses. I didn't see anything good about her character - first, she lied to her friends about having a boyfriend, took a picture of someone she doesn't even know and used it as a proof and lied about it to her friends just so, she have something to \"show off\". Then out of desperation to keep her lies: she agreed to become his \"pet\" - all because she was desperate to get along with her friends who obviously are no good for her. Then fell for the man who treated her like an animal and endured all of his abuses, simply because \"she loves him\"\\n\\n\r\nSata: At first, I thought he looked liked Gintoki (lol). He is your usual \"Handsome, popular but rude male lead who have a sad past\" - the author wanted to give him a sad past to justified his actions, but for me, that reason wasn't really bad enough for him to end up like that- for me, he is nothing but a weak and emo spoiled brat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1/10\\n\r\nEven though I am anemic, watching this anime made me feel like I am going to have a high blood pressure. The story is no good and the characters are pathetic and annoying. Some says that, this is like an S&M relationship, which I don't really agree with.\\n\\n",

            "content": "To begin, you should all know that I hate anime where the female protagonist bends over backwards to gather whatever crumbs of affection a cold, asshole of a male lead deigns to toss her way (I'm looking at you Itazura na Kiss).\r\nThat being said, there are exceptions to every rule; and I guess I found mine in Ookami Shoujo to Kuroouji. Part of my fondness for this anime could be that there seems to be a shoujo anime drought going on. But I digress, so without further ado, let me review.\r\nOokami Shoujo to Kuroouji is a twelve episode romcom and a predictably predictable shoujo formula.But I wouldn't say that it's a bad thing. \\n\\n\r\nThe story begins with an intro to our heroine Shinohara Erika. A typical bubbly and dense heroine who dreams of experiencing the fabled \"high school life\". A wrench is thrown into Erika's plans when she is separated from her best friend and they are placed in different classes. This is where Erika reveals a quirk that sets her apart from other shoujo heroines. \\n\r\nShe is a compulsive liar. In order to fit in with her classmates, Marin and Tezuka, with whom she has little in common, Erika makes up a boyfriend to give her something to talk about with them.\\n\r\nHer lie unfortunately only worked short-term. Her friends are beginning to sense the truth and Erika's cried wolf (or in this case, boyfriend) a little too loud, and a little too often to backtrack now. To reinforce her lie Erika takes a picture of a hot guy on the street and passes him off as her boyfriend. Too late, Erika finds out that the hot guy is actually a student at her school, Sata Kyouya. Erika asks him to pretend to be her boyfriend, thinking he will agree because he is such a prince, or whatever. And he does. On the condition that she be his dog.\\n\\n\r\nSo Sata-kun turns out to be an evil sadist and Erika his hapless victim, who inevitably falls in love with him because he was nice a couple times. And if the series continued on in this vein, this review would be a lot more scathing. It turns itself around at episode 6.\\n\\n\r\nErika does the usual thing where she \"works hard\" to win Kyouya's love but admits she gets tired when she does all the chasing with little reciprocation, and that she gets humiliated by him time and again. \\n\\n\r\nKyouya is a bit more complicated than your average male lead in that his popular, friendly personality is a complete lie. Later in the series one realizes his personality is more like that of a bitter, introverted loner (Hachiman Hikigaya, anyone?)\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of this show for me was seeing the two protagonists change because of their involvement with each other. Kyouya is less sadist and more tsundere. And it's adorable to watch him struggle to express his affection for Erika (which definitely becomes more apparent) and break through the barriers he's created to keep people at bay. Erika can be a little hard to take at times, but she was strong when it counted, and refreshingly forward. In the end I understood her determination to win Kyouya. After all, the bigger they are, the harder they fall. And it was supremely satisfying watching Kyouya fall. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in the show is clean with nice colour and is very, very shoujo.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was fine, not outstanding except for the punchy and unusual theme song. Sort of like a Japanese Avril Lavigne, I listened to it everytime, which is quite unusual for me. \\n\\n\r\nThis show had cringeworthy moments, but also had genuinely funny and sweet ones too. \\n\\n\r\nWhen you're suffering from drought, any refreshment is welcome, and Ookami Shoujo to Kuroouji quenched my thirst.",

            "content": "Ever heard of the phrase \u2018don\u2019t bite off more than you can chew?\u2019 Figuratively speaking, if you get a plain girl aiming for that dream guy, then that\u2019s more than what they can ask for. Meet Erika, the main female protagonist of this series who is exactly the plain girl. Then, we have the dream guy named Kyouya Sata. With those princely like looks, it\u2019s no wonder every girl wants to be his girlfriend. However, this show isn\u2019t about a perfect romantic get-away with these two. No, it\u2019s far from that. Wolf Girl (Erika) and Black Prince (Sata) unites two characters in a story ofdrama, abuse, and teenage youth by two complete opposite strangers.\\n\\n\r\nAs a standard shoujo series, Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji (Wolf Girl and Black Prince) is pretty generic from the get-go. It takes place in a school life setting where drama ensures. And judging by the ages of the characters, most of the girls seems to be interested in boys. No exception comes with Erika as she wants to a boyfriend, or at least someone to brag about. The funny part is that she ends up getting more than what she bargains for: Kyouya Sata. The first few episode depicts their awkward encounter that eventually gets her into a \u201crelationship\u201d with the guy. The quotation means that their relationship is fake although is used as a mask by Erika to prove her accomplishment of snatching the hottest guy at school. The picture isn\u2019t really pretty from behind the scenes though. Sata is more or less so the type of jerk where he cares about nothing but himself. Actually, his action implies himself as a sadist who rejects romance and wants Erika as her servant/dog. It\u2019s silly on the forefront and completely unexpected for someone like Erika. By some point, would you feel sorry for her? Perhaps but it\u2019s her problem to deal with now.\\n\\n\r\nThe series explains the problems that goes on between Erika and Sata. From the beginning, Erika must somehow always maintain the posture that they are dating as a couple rather than being labeled as frauds. Several instances throughout the series lands them in clich\u00e9 misunderstandings where their relationship become close to being jeopardized. While this is seen in many shoujo series, this anime goes into diehard mode to let the audience know exactly the type of person Sata is. At some point, you might genuinely feel sorry for Erika. However, there\u2019s also cases where we see a different side of Sata, one which we realize he might not be the bad boy he tries to be. Examples include situations where Erika gets into real trouble and Sata has to save the day. Also throughout the series, it\u2019s heavily implied that Sata develops real feelings for Erika and vice versa. As a controlling boyfriend though, Sata is one of those guys that is hard to please. Unfortunately, Erika is usually on the receiving end of punishments that lands her into even more trouble.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Erika herself, there\u2019s development for her character. At first, she often cares about what other people thinks and does anything to establish a reputation. Because let\u2019s face it, high school is about making an impact and youth really accelerates when you meet that special someone. Erika experiences this first hand later on when she realizes that special someone could actually be Sata. The question comes to matter is how far she is willing to go for Sata. At various times, she realizes that there may or may not be a way to change Sata. That isn\u2019t really the point anyways since the show focuses a lot more on their relationship rather than see who can change who. On an even more frustrating note, we don\u2019t really know much about Sata\u2019s past in regards to his background story. For a guy with such reputation at school, there\u2019s only very few that knows the real him.\\n\\n\r\nRelationships can be a nutshell when other characters gets involved. And like many other shoujo series, we do have side characters that complicates Erika and Sata\u2019s relationship. If the first two words that come to your mind are \u2018love rivals\u2019, then you are correct. As predictable as it can be, the show introduces both male and female characters as a seemingly way to test how Erika or Sata can cope when someone else asks them out. Characters introduced in the series ranges from shy loners to playboys. You can just imagine how this can influence their relationship when a misunderstanding between them can go out of hand. A problem with this is how the show neglects their relationship building but instead focuses on how they deal with it separately. Not only that but the comedy faded as well when certain situations become serious. Luckily, a good deal of the show has comedy, a factor that makes the series quite entertaining. There\u2019s no denying that there\u2019s comedy when it comes to this show whether it\u2019s be Sata\u2019s constant abuse or Erika\u2019s life. Still, when the story gets on the melancholic side with what it has built, then the series suffers from momentum. The plus side is that comedy is present in good doses throughout the series when there\u2019s opportunity. Timing is key and the show does nail that on most parts whether it\u2019d be Sata\u2019s taunts, zany imaginations, or anything you may see related in a couple who are nothing alike to each other.\\n\\n\r\nFor this particular shoujo series, the artwork would be labeled as average at best. The characters are designed with stereotypes with no particular character standing out above the others. Some noticeable features are probably Sata and his reactions that can strike as comedy gold. Otherwise, don\u2019t expect some high quality delivery from this series when it comes to artwork or visuals. The background, settings, and character designs is a bad joke itself with uninspired effort.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is more or less of an interest to take notice. I say this because of the character voice mannerisms, a trait that is actually quite important for the main characters. This is especially true for Sata as he hides his true character. I do give him some credit for his tone of voice when he is able to quickly shift between the prince charming to the controlling master. On the other hand, Erika can sound like a child at times when she complains. It gets tiresome and frustrating when the series continues to recycle her personality over and over to express it in audio scenarios. Otherwise, the OP and ED songs are amusing to watch not because of the lyrics but the coordination of the scenes. Like I mentioned before, comedy plays out a large part of this show\u2019s entertainment so those songs hit the right notes.\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji is like a test to see how far Sata and Erika will score as a couple by the end of the show. I don\u2019t mean it literally as this show\u2019s score but rather their relationship and its development. To say the least, it is a mixed bag with obstacles and challenges. However, the show knows its intentions and highlights that with plenty of opportunities to make the audience laugh. It may not be a stand-up comedy but the show has that enthralling grip when it does try. Just be aware that the show is nothing less than predictable, conventional, and saturated with the usual moments that may make you go \u2018been there, done that\u2019.\\n",

            "content": "Wolf Girl & Black Prince is a really sad excuse for a romance anime, doing for romantic comedy what Twilight did for teenage relationships and taking it a step further to S&M. \r\nWolf Girl & Black Prince is about Erika Shinohara, a 16-year-old girl who finds herself starting a new year of school, but is alienated from the other students because they have all formed their own cliques. In order to befriend two girls, she tells them about her romantic exploits with her boyfriend, despite the fact she has no boyfriend.\r\nShe claims that a handsome boy in a candid photo is her boyfriend, unaware thathe is her schoolmate, Kyouya Sata. In order to hide her lie, she asks him to keep her secret and he offers to become her fake boyfriend. Unfortunately for her, while Sata acts like a sweet person in public, he is actually a black-hearted sadist, and blackmails her into becoming his dog. \\n\\n\r\nRight off the bat, Wolf Girl is very bright and colorful, but the overall art is lacking, as most of the detail went into the male characters, mainly Kyouya, causing the others to pale in comparison. You'll notice that throughout the show the colors on Kyouya Sata just pop, but when the scene flips over to Erika, the same attention to detail is absent. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is barely sub-par and pretty average as far as shoujo anime go.  It's also too sharp of a contrast to the dark subject matter, and the opening theme feels like its trying to romanticize the story into something positive even though it isn't.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development-wise, there is some progression, though slow, with background on Kyouya to illuminate the viewers on why he's such a flaming douchebag. Yet again, a whole lot of focus on the male lead, which doesn't leave much room for the other characters to grow in the story. But several episodes in and the side characters make so few appearances they become generic plot devices anyway.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire storyline is chock full of drama, with power play and S&M fleshed out across the whole series. Kyouya takes up almost all the limelight and character development, accounting for a huge chunk of each of the 12 installments. And because he's such convincing eye-candy, you don't notice you're wasting your life watching him hog screen time just so he can be an asshole to a teenage girl. \\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, Kyouya's entire personality detracts from his character, making him creepy and off-putting. His entire relationship with Erika from the beginning is founded on the basis for control, or put more simply, because he wants a dog he can order around. But that's about where things stop being funny. Kyouya's obsession with having power over her leads him to push the boundaries of what is acceptable, even going as far as to emotionally toy with Erika in increasingly cruel ways even when she bares her emotions to him.\\n\\n\r\nThis twisted rendition of a master/slave relationship ultimately personifies an abusive relationship and the death of feminism all in one series. If that was what the creators were going for, they hit two birds with one stone.\\n\\n\r\nBut seriously, who wants a heroine who just lets herself get walked all over and then comes back for more?\\n\\n\r\nWolf Girl & Black Prince tries to be lighthearted about the delicate subject matter, but its dark undertones make the whole relationship between Erika and Sata seem deeply disturbing. \\n\\n\r\nEven in light of the fact the anime tries to excuse Kyouya's behavior with his past, it doesn't do much in the way of rectifying all the torment he inflicted on Erika, nor does it convince me that all is okay. In the end, Kyouya's actions defy logic by bringing Erika closer instead of destroying their relationship. \\n\\n\r\nSadly, the one character is not Wolf Girl's only flaw. The amount of female subordination to boot is appalling. Erika Shinohara proves to be as dumb as she is naive, excusing Kyouya's abuse time and again and being bought with acts of fake kindness. \\n\\n\r\nSomewhere in the story line, a new love prospect opens up for Erika, but she opts out in favor of...you guessed it, Kyouya. \\n\\n\r\nUnbearably optimistic, Erika's seiyuu was bubbly and high-pitched to the point of inducing a headache. Kyouya's seiyuu on the other hand was impressive, but sadly not enough to lift this anime off the ground.\\n\\n\r\nI honestly wouldn't even recommend Wolf Girl & Black Prince, unless you're the type of person who likes watching S&M at its finest. This show calls itself a romance anime, but I was not feeling any love at all from this one.",

            "content": "Spoiler warning, just in case you didn't realize this was a shoujo anime:\r\nKyoya is an asshole. BUT ERIKA FALLS IN LOVE WITH HIM ANYWAY!!! I guess you figured this was coming, since it's a shoujo anime.\r\nI know that there's a cross-cultural divide between myself (American) and the story (Japanese), but in no way is it romantic to allow yourself to be abused the way Kyoya abuses Erika. Not to mention that even if he's only treating her badly because he doesn't care about her, what's to say that he'll stop treating her badly when he actually comes to love her. He basically doesn't stop treatingher badly, but he does stop treating her like a dog.\\n\\n\r\nAbuse, turn off number one. Even mild abuse is abuse. She should have walked away sooner, but I guess if she'd walked away, this anime wouldn't have happened and Kyoya would have just stayed the same as he was.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this story is pretty generic. What is it with girls in anime falling for assholes?? And then changing them???\\n\\n\r\nCan I just say: If you fall in love with someone who is not a great person, you are not going to change them. You're not going to change anyone you date, and this should not be your goal or mission, because you're the one who will end up hurt and changed.\\n\\n\r\nOther than the frankly obnoxious story, the art was decent. They did kind of interesting walking sequences. The sound was good. There was a variety of characters, but not much development as far as I could tell, except in Kyoya. But his development didn't make much sense to me, for reasons mentioned above.\\n\\n\r\nI struggled to enjoy the anime taking in to account that Kyoya's character development didn't make any sense.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I don't recommend this, unless you're bored.a",

            "content": "Demographics can be tricky thing to talk about when talking about anime. They aren't specific genres, but are more used for targeting specific groups of people. However, just because they are targeting a certain age group and/or gender doesn't mean those shows are limited to that group of people alone. But in Ookami Shoujo's case, I firmly believe it the vast majority of people who enjoy this show will be in the shoujo demographic, which is primarily why I found this show mediocre at best.\r\nThe shows first problem for me was came right off the bat. The basic premise of the show is Erika tryingto remain friends with two students by lying that she has a boyfriend, because that her two \"friends\" basically only talk about their boyfriends. The thing is, those friends are absolute assholes, and even tried to sabotage her \"relationship\" with Kyoya early on. If Erika was completely friendless, I could, at the very least, understand why she would want to be fake friends with them, but she already has a really good friend in Ayumi to begin with, so one of the major drawing points of the entire show just feels pointless and redundant to me. However, I can only help but feel like I can't understand Erika's plight simply because of the whole shoujo demographic thing, and that the whole premise might be much more relatable to actual teenage girls than to me. \\n\\n\r\nBut lets get into the real problem I have with this show. The whole relationship between Kyouya and Erika is more or less completely baseless, and it feels like the actions that led up to the end result made no sense. Kyoya treated Erika like trash, but for some reason, Erika falls in love with him. Kyoya did maybe 5 good things to Erika MAXIMUM throughout months and months of treating her like a dog, and Erika focused solely on those 5 good things that Kyoya did for her, and felt compelled to start an actual relationship with him.  The only real reason Erika and Kyoya got together was because the writers made it so. There was no rhyme or reason for it, no emotional connection, no nothing. Hell, Erika had a chance with this really nice kid, Kusakabe, who actually treated her like a human being, but she turned him down anyways because fuck logic.\\n\\n\r\nBut for all the bashing I have for this show, I'll give credit where credit is due. For once, an anime showcases a relationship that goes beyond the kiss scene, and shows Erika and Kyoya as a couple. Very few romance anime actually do this, and I did end up enjoying the last few episodes because of this. This doesn't make up for the fact that their relationship is based off of nothing, but I thought Erika and Kyoya were kind of cute together after they officially became a couple. Sure, this development kind of came out of nowhere, and Kyoya changed drastically personality wise (which is a big plus for his character, but didn't make much sense to me), but it at least made those last few episodes much more tolerable. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then, we have the supporting cast, which really didn't do much for me. Most of the supporting cast were either nice people, or just plain assholes, with the exception of maybe Nozomi. All the supporting: nice characters, assholes, , were pretty much one note archetypes, even if some of them are different than what we are normally used to. You have your lovable idiot, your playboy, your level-headed best friend, etc. Most of them were more fun to watch than Erika and Kyoya were (which isn't saying much), but they weren't much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound wise, there isn't much to say. The art is dull and uninspired, with not much detail throughout. The animation is choppy and framey. Hell, I could even point out some key frames that were left unfinished on the final episode, although that is just nitpicking. \\n\\n\r\nI can say the same thing about the sound that I can about the art, it was dull and uninspired. I don't even remember beat, any melody, or even if there were any insert songs because it was just that forgettable. The opening is notable only because it sounds like an Avril Lavigne pop song, but that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nIt's clear that I didn't like this show, but I can't say that it is necessarily bad, because the show wasn't made for teenage guys like me in mind. That being said, I don't know if I would recommend this show to a teenage girl either based on my experiences. Take this review with a grain of salt, because I bet there are some who would find the shit that I didn't like about the show actually compelling. As for me, I'm glad that this show is forever out of my mind, and I can go back to watching some more Monster or something.",

I'm not too fond of the abusive nature of the main male character Kyouya, and the weak-willed personality of the female main, Erika. Actually, I didn't care for any of the characters in this show. The \"teaching moments\" in this show felt really forced.\r\nKyouya was made be Tsundere character, but, really, this guys shows no change at all - he's just a jerk, and I don't thinkanyone would take his BS for that amount of time. No matter what, Kyouya treats Erika like she's a possession, and is not only controlling, but hurts her over an over again, and doesn't seem to care, and she just accepts it keeps taking the abuse.\\n\\n\r\nSure, love can do crazy things, but this is just too much to tolerate. Girls, women, females at any age do not enjoy being treated like that.\\n\\n\r\nI used to volunteer at women shelters, and I would see this kind of thing all the time. It was heart wrenching to see women who were abused both mentally and physically and still go back.\\n\\n\r\nI'm told that the manga gets better, but really, I just don't care to continue this, or explore it further. I'm sorry, I just cannot tolerate to watch the guy absolute torture this girl.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime sends a terrible message to young girls, and boys who think that young girls like this type of guy.

            "content": "Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji was a very up and down experience for me. It is, to some degree, a story about romance and acceptance, presented in a more comedic manner.\r\nStory - 6/10.\r\nThe story presented to us is a simple one. Our main character gets herself into a bit of a mess due to her compulsion to lie to gain friends, and this and that happens and she winds up with a frankly abhorrent guy who is essentially her 'owner'. A simple concept for a romance anime relatively well-executed, especially in the comedy aspect. Nothing ground-breaking, there was no real depth to the story, andany depth that was added into the story came off as a little shallow and contrived (for example, most of the flashbacks seemed to be trying to create a background just for the sake of it, as the story didn't really need much of it to be effective.)\\n\r\nMost of the 'story' really revolves around Erika and Kyoya and the way their relationship develops throughout the series, and as such it has no real resolution. It was also a little predictable at times.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10.\\n\r\nNot quite outstanding, but certainly worth a mention - the character designs were pretty consistent, the colours suited the mood the anime was trying to put across (for example the common bright colours seen in a comedy scene) and the backgrounds were nicely rendered. The characters weren't anything hugely unique, but at the same time they were very suited to the rom-com slice of life-ish genre, all looking relatively 'normal'.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10.\\n\r\nThe opening theme to the anime was fitting to the genre - quite cute and bouncy and generally fun. The voices were good, and the background noise fit well, especially in the comedic moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10.\\n\r\nAlthough the series really revolved around Kyoya and Erika and their relationship and relationships with others, the two main characters are what could have made or broken the series for me. At first they are presented as two pretty awful personalities, one being a compulsive liar (and a bad one at that) and subsequently a subservient wet leaf, the other being on a VERY high horse with some sort of superiority complex. The premise behind the series was that the two would get into their 'dog' and 'master' roles and as a consequence they would most likely end up changing one another. This did happen, though it took its sweet time (which is why the series was so up-and-down for me). Erika really comes across as a weak personality until about half-way through the series at which point you can really see her effect on Kyoya and how their relationship develops, and how she develops from a really un-likeable character to a quite sweet person.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10.\\n\r\nI couldn't enjoy this series as much as I would have liked simply because I felt it was quite slow to get started, although there were cute and funny moments I really couldn't stand the main characters and up until they started changing and affecting each other I was left pretty frustrated with them. The second half was an exception for me, although there were some feeble attempts at creating drama generally it was successful in portraying Erika and Kyoya's relationship with one another and the effect different situations had on them.\\n",

            "content": "Damn I gotta say this anime surprised me. \r\nSo today I decided to take a break from hajime no ippo and my rewatch of eyeshield 21 and watch a short anime that would be you know easy to watch and enjoyable. And one of the best animes for that in my oppinion are slice of life / school / comedy animes. So while searching for a comedy anime I randomly came across Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji...and I gotta say I really enjoyed it more than I expected to as it was very easy to watch. But enough small talk let's jump into the review.\r\nArt9 / 10\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy this type of art and you could see the anime was made at a high quality. The characters were drawn as mostly generic / secondary characters but each one had a unique feature and you could easely tell them apart. The animation was fluid and smooth and really pleasant to the eye and damn Erika is sooo cute and Kyouya's eyes are epic.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is quite generic. I do like the intro but the soundtrack of the anime is nothing out of the ordinary. The voices for the characters are alright. Not too fancy but they are not bad either. I honestly really like Erika's voice because I think it furthers the idea that she is a cute fun girl not a \"hot\" one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are decent. They are nothing special though. You have this really funny (but also a very big and bad liar) protagonist girl (Erika) that is also a very sweet and nice person and you also got Kyouya who is kinda-of a sweet douchebag that turns into a somewhat nice guy by the end of the anime. The other characters are there but they are nothing too important since they episodic and just used to further the development of the 2 main characters Erika and Kyouya.\\n\\n\r\nStory 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOk before I rant a bit here is an explanation why the story is a bit lower for me. I felt the anime could have ended midway at 2 certain events (they kinda follow each other quite fast but I will refrain from talking about them since it might spoil the anime, though they are not hard to guess). \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the episodes felt a bit like useless fillers but they were enjoyable nontheless.(I know they wanted to show the characters actually grow and stuff still the anime would have been as enjoyable without them in my oppinion). \\n\\n\r\nThe story is pretty generic MC1 falls for MC2 while MC2 is a tsundere type char (even though Kyouya is not that tsundere you get the point). The anime follows all the required steps in the story and has a solid one. If it was a bit shorter (let's say 10 episodes) the anime would probably have been 1 7/10 or maybe even 8/10. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8 / 10\\n\\n\r\nFor some reason though I really enjoyed the anime. It was light-hearthed , somewhat funny and very easy to watch thus I went through it in one cold afternoon .\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime had charming MCs and their interactions were entertaining, it was light-hearthed , somewhat funny and very easy to watch and the art is really good.  I would recommend it to people who want an easy viewing while taking a break from more serious / longer animes.\\n",

            "content": "~generous note about how it's my first review and English isn't my native language~\r\nI'm not really good with writing this kind of things, so let's see how will it go.\r\n\"Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji\", also known as \"Wolf Girl and Black Prince\".\r\nThe story was told greatly. Nothing was missing. The great thing about it was that it isn't your typical shoujo/romance anime - it wasn't predictable and that's really what comes to liking. Although at the beginning I had problems with the romance/comedy that position has to offer - it's also not your usual humor (and romance) after all. The ending really satisfied me though.\r\nAsto art, I can't tell as a professional, because I'm none of that... although I really liked it. The characters' designs were great. Characters did not look similar.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuus' voices were matching perfectly. The background music was fitting and so I'll try to find the OST and listen to it. I particularly liked both OP/ED songs, they're catchy and may want to make you sing along.\\n\\n\r\nAs I stated before, this isn't your typical anime. This one tells a more realistic story. That also means the characters were more realistic, although I don't really know if you'd like to place yourself in the shoes of one of the main characters. I couldn't relate to any of the characters, but that didn't make me dislike them. The main characters actually grew throughout the series, which was great to look at. The supporting cast was hilarious in a good way. I'll definitely remember the characters in the future.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I think you'll enjoy this series, because... it shows some realistic things, which are surprising, but great nonetheless. Even if you're not a big fan of anime (or just these genres), you should definitely check this one out. I'll surely go back to the anime and start reading the manga. Also, I think re-watching will definitely add to the enjoyment. I'd love to own this series. The series was really memorable and unique in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nMoral of the story is: \\n\r\n~SPOILER~\\n\r\nDon't take pictures (or maybe do take them?) of random people and do not (?) try to pretend they're your second half.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nSociety can often exert pressures on everyday people, causing them to behave or act in a certain way. These may be small in scale, such as deciding what restaurant to eat at, or more grand, such as who to vote for in the next election. It's something that many people often experience, that inkling feeling of wanting to \"fit in.\" This is just as true in relation to love. People love others for fun, while some may find solace in establishing a meaningful connection. In Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji, these societal pressures and loving ideas are tested,giving us an okay little anime.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nOokami Shoujo follows Erika, a young high school girl who, finding herself without any friends in her new class, makes up a lie. This lie leads her to Kyouya, with the journey unfolding from there.\\n\\n\r\nFor Ookami Shoujo, it quite quickly sets up its overall \"format:\" introduce a side character, utilize him/her for a few episodes, progress Erika and Kyouya's relationship, and then repeat. It's simple, but often times it leads to the same repetitive character actions. Erika getting upset at Kyouya, the side character more or less not showing up ever again, and the relationship experiencing the same hurdles constantly are common within each mini-arc. This causes a bad association with often boring developments, because the audience knows exactly what to expect.\\n\\n\r\nWhat this one does right, though, is portraying or at least displaying such a couple. In anime, many romances revolve around the \"normal\" guy having the cute and kind girl fall for one another. Ookami Shoujo strays away from this. Instead, Kyouya is the goal, with Erika chasing after his coattails. In laymen's terms, it's the classic \"girls love bad guys\" idea. And it works. The reason for this comes from the perception that is created for Kyouya and Erika. His derisive remarks and her wavering emotions demonstrate how such an unlikely couple operates. While people may think that everyone in a loving relationship maintain traits of kindness, awareness, and respect, this one gives us a varied look at what it means to \"care\" for another person.\\n\\n\r\nThe show tries somewhat to present the idea that it's okay to just be yourself. There may exist a \"certain\" way to go about behaving, but learning to just be who you are (obviously, within reason) and not caving to such pressures makes life a much more rewarding experience. I say somewhat, because this direction is lost somewhere around halfway through the season, where it then begins to focus almost entirely on the romance. This is perhaps due in part to the character developments of the main cast. Opting for pure romance is fine, but since the earlier idea was first introduced, there needed to be some semblance of balance -- peer pressure and romance.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nOokami Shoujo sits in a rather strange spot.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is what I usually describe as \"soft.\" It most often exists within shoujo anime, where the locales and characters are given an aura about them that makes everything seem plain or natural. A good comparison would be to Kimi ni Todoke. With an average amount of detail, the show usually incorporates more flair and appeal during the comedy bits. Here, the anime defers to more goofy eyes and faces, shining backgrounds, and other fantastical tricks.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as character designs go, Kyouya is rather boring with his usual long-sleeve shirts and ruffled hair. Erika, however, sees many transformations from her hair to her outfits. Making more comparisons, while she doesn't hold the same allure, Erika's simple beauty reminded me greatly of Nanami from Kamisama Kiss.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual animation is somewhat lacking, mainly due to the nature of the show. That is, it's mostly just dialogue between the main couple or conversations existing between other classmates and side characters. The animation can pick up during the aforementioned comedic bits, though.\\n\\n\r\nIt also has a habit of doing this weird technique of having the characters speaking dialogue with just their portraits being shown in the foreground. This just adds to the argument that the animation within the anime is sometimes missing.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nOokami Shoujo actually contains an okay set of characters despite the underwhelming story.\\n\\n\r\nAs the star of the show, Erika is a nice young girl who is quick to be dishonest. Her \"true self\" causes her more trouble than it's worth, but she consistently makes it her mission to fabricate her life as much as possible. While she is quick to lie, when faced with hardship and reality, she is unusually emotional. While her initial relationship with Kyouya starts off as nothing more than a game, her feelings rapidly move from side girl to lover the more time she spends with him. Her ability to handle not only what Kyouya dishes out but also his rather hostile attitude makes her the seemingly perfect girl for him.\\n\\n\r\nKyouya's public persona paints him as a perfect prince. What hides beneath this kind mask he has created is a river filled with scorn, hatred, and just downright evil. At every opportunity that presents itself, he attempts to make Erika's life a living nightmare. He's actually incredibly standoffish and unbearably cruel. But in truth, this is just another of his masks. With Erika now in his life, what one finds behind his (many) shells is a young man filled with compassion and awareness.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a huge issue with his character, however. The anime attempted to expand upon why Kyouya acts the way he does, but it comes off as being insignificant due to its quick overview and extremely late inclusion. While his development from an intolerable brute to a slightly jerk-ish boyfriend was nice to see, his actual characterization lacks the depth that was constantly alluded to throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the side cast, while they are cast aside more literally than their title implies, what they do is try to propel Erika and Kyouya's relationship, and more specifically Kyouya, forward. Each mini-arc aims to add another crack to those shells of his, giving Erika the chance to crush them for good. This is accomplished by having Kyouya experience suppressed emotions: jealousy, happiness, and nervousness, to name a few. They're tiny actions, but they slowly build on one another, letting Kyouya go through the development that he does.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is okay. The vocalist, guitar, and drums work nicely in unison, with the singer being given the opportunity to showcase a decent amount of range.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED actually gets my vote as one of the best of the season. The strange ambient sound effects, the pinging, and the somewhat slow singing make it very fun to listen to on each and every playback.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is sadly not as good. The one track featuring a wavy trumpet and hanging triangle that played during certain sections was usually catchy, but everything else falls under the \"generic\" category.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, for voice acting, there are no notable performances to be had. At the minimum, Kanae Itou as Erika did somewhat above average.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI say it time and time again: romance is my go-to genre above all others. Watching Erika get flustered around Kyouya or Kyouya looking to protect his girlfriend from a potential jerk made me happy to see. Obviously there are other elements placed throughout, such as gift exchanges, pictures, and those all-important couple moments. And they all had their intended effect: making me smile.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is also pretty funny. Even though Kyouya is really cruel, Erika's reactions were always good for a laugh. The animation, as stated previously, also adds to the comedy. It does try to inject smaller dramatic moments, but these are overshadowed by the more hilarious and romantic ones, which was for the better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji is a simple romance story featuring a not-so-simple couple. While the plot may be missing, the characters involved at least try to make up for it. And if this anime teaches us anything, it's that not everyone should always be taken at face value.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, unique romance filled with repetition and unclear themes\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, \"soft\" art style, average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Erika is okay, Kyouya is good, side cast is okay\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, great ED, okay soundtrack, average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, nice romantic elements mixed with comedy\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "A pretty common complaint about romance anime is that the romance aspect \u2013 that is, the main attraction of the show \u2013 is slow to develop and the characters take an eternity to get together. Oftentimes, we have drama and comedy taking up screen time of what could be couples fawning over one another and going out on dates. To some people, that means that the bulk of a romance anime is filler, with the characters only getting together or confessing in the last few episodes \u2013 and sometimes, not even then! (Kimi ni Todoke, anyone?) Then came along Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji, wherethe main characters get together in the first episode \u2013 oh, no, wait, I'm mistaken. They're actually faking it. Sorry to get your hopes up! But wait, there's more. They do drop the faux couple act later on...it's just a matter of whether or not you'll have the patience to actually stick with it to the end. And I'm not promising you'll enjoy it, even if you do, for the simple fact that it takes some amount of distance to like this anime. \\n\\n\r\nShinohara Erika is a bit different from the usual shoujo main character. She's simple-minded and dense, true, but she also has an enormous yearning to fit in with her peers. Additionally, she's not afraid to tell a lie to do so. Erika wants to be accepted and loved so much that she is quick to fall head over heels for anyone who shows even the slightest bit of kindness to her. She's very gullible and very eager to please. That actually makes her a somewhat well-rounded protagonist; at least she's well-developed enough that she is believable and even understandable. I'm sure we all know someone who is a little (or a lot) like Erika in some ways. What is a bit less believable is her single-minded, almost self-destructive thirst to be accepted, but hey, there are people like that, too. \\n\\n\r\nSata Kyouya, on the other hand, adopts the persona of a \u201ckindhearted prince\u201d, when in reality he's a cold, sadistic individual. Calculating and observant, he's the sort that likes to know he has complete control of himself and his surroundings. He doesn't really understand emotions or romance, mainly because, as a child, a particular event caused him to become extremely closed off and reproachful of anyone who tried to get close to him. While it doesn't excuse his actions in any way, shape, or form, it definitely helps one understand his actions. There's almost nothing sadder than a home that lacks a mother, and that lack of presence is felt. Over the course of the anime, he becomes less of a cold bastard and more simply a reserved, introverted individual. In that regard, he's a bit original, even though he does display some tsundere traits.  \\n\\n\r\nSo, what brings this unlikely duo together? During the first day of high school, Erika meets two girls in her class. Desperate for friends, she nearly trips over her own two feet to integrate herself into their group. This entails being \u201cjust like them\u201d and having a boyfriend of her own. A few months into the semester, though, her newfound \u201cfriends\u201d are already beginning to smell her lie \u2013 especially since Erika doesn't have a single picture of her boyfriend to show them. One day, Erika sees a cute guy on the street and decides to take a picture of him, playing him off as her boyfriend. Only problem is that the guy she takes a picture of happens to be the \u201cprince\u201d of her school, Kyouya, and her friends recognize him almost immediately. This leaves her no choice but to ask Kyouya to pretend to be her boyfriend. He agrees, but for a price: she has to be his \u201cdog\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nI ought to be shaking my fist, right? I ought to loathe this anime along with the likes of Itazura na Kiss, Diabolik Lovers, and Mitsu x Mitsu Drops, right? Problem is, I don't. It takes a particular person to laugh at the jokes and humour in Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji, and a particular viewpoint, and if you fit neither, it's safe to say you'll hate this anime. However, this anime is a lot more tolerable than those of the same ilk \u2013 for one thing, Kyouya isn't a psychopath like Irie Naoki of ItaKiss. He's not doing the things he does because he genuinely wants to hurt her, he genuinely has no understanding of the fact that she's affected to the extent that she is. In fact, by the end of the anime, it's made pretty clear that he's trying his damned hardest to break down his own inner walls and inhibitions and be more affectionate to Erika. He just doesn't know how, darn it. I'm not the greatest at showing my emotions, either. I can hardly blame the guy. I'm betting he's an INTJ. We INTJs always have problems with those flimsy, abstract things. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm not excusing his actions, and if I were Erika's friend, I'd tell her to break it off with Kyouya. But Erika herself doesn't seem to want to. She's given multiple opportunities to break it off with him, and never takes them. Even when she's been separated from him for days, she still decides, of her own volition, to go back to him, because she still likes him no matter what he does. As she herself states, she likes him because of who he is, and changing even a single part of him wouldn't make him the same person anymore. If he makes her genuinely happy and he isn't forcing her to be with him, then who I am to judge? I certainly can't go about forcing my ideals on others. \\n\\n\r\nPlus, let's face it: not everyone's perfect, and not everyone is going to know exactly what's right and wrong to do in a relationship. The anime is basically the beginning of their adventure with something called \u201cdating\u201d, and forgive them if they don't know how to swim in deep water right away. Also, believe me: Kyouya's behaviour toward Erika gets a million times better in the manga, especially when you compare him to the first couple episodes of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nIf you don't have a sensitive skin and aren't the type to go social justice on everything, even the moments where Kyouya \u201cscolds\u201d Erika can actually be fairly amusing. At least, I found myself chuckling a few times upon my rewatch of the anime. In any case, there are times everyone has disagreements, and our main characters are no exception. Of interesting note is the fact that the anime brings up morals and conduct quite a bit, and really likes to pose the question of what is or isn't all right to do. Of course, one's mileage may vary, and the point of the matter is that there are different ways to approach love and romance, and making mistakes is fine so long as you realize what you're doing wrong and try to fix it. Neither Kyouya nor Erika are innocent in this regard. Erika, for her part, has a highly rose-coloured view of love, and Kyouya has a fairly negative impression of it. And Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji is what you get when those extremes clash. \\n\\n\r\nSince this is only a twelve episode anime, we don't have that many side characters. They are mainly Sanda Ayumi, Erika's best friend; Marin and Tezuka, the two girls Erika meets in her class; and Takeru, Kyouya's friend from the middle school era. Of course, there are other characters as well, but they hardly get enough screen time or development to be considered truly important. A couple are only introduced for one episode and then forgotten. That being said, that doesn't mean the other characters develop at all. They're static. Marin and Tezuka are introduced as two girls who constantly talk about their boyfriends, and that's who they are in the end. Sanda relentlessly offers Erika advice and informs her that she is a masochist for putting up with Kyouya's behaviour \u2013 that doesn't change, either. Takeru is introduced as a guy full of a manly sense of justice, and he doesn't change one bit. That doesn't meant they're bad characters, though, since the majority of the character development comes from Erika and Kyouya. Mostly Kyouya. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme is a vaguely catchy number by SpecialThanks, called LOVE GOOD TIME. The vocalist has a somewhat slurry, \u201crock and roll princess\u201d sort of accent that immediately reminds me of Full Moon wo Sagashite's openings (both of which are by THE*SCANTY). The song itself is rather upbeat, but not necessarily memorable, apart from the singer's voice. The ending is Ookami Heart, sung by Oresama. It's pretty average stuff as well. The whole soundtrack is just quite mediocre; while I didn't notice any overly obvious usage of repeated tracks, there were several moments where I found myself thinking, \u201coh, this sounds just like a theme I heard in ___\u201d. In short, while the music isn't extravagant, it does its job just fine. The Japanese voice actors are pretty good. They really fit with the characters they were meant to represent. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is nice and clean. Typical shoujo fare, really. The guys are good-looking and the girls are cute. Sparkles and bubbles abound. When the animation isn't focused on those, it's pretty fluid. TYO Animations does a pretty good job! Thankfully, there isn't a surplus of chibi/super-deformed segments, which jives just right with me, since I'm not usually overly fond of those. One interesting thing to note is that Ookami Shoujo tends to animate talking heads over backgrounds during extended character interaction scenes. By that I mean, if two characters are sitting at a table and talking, often, the \u201ccamera\u201d will display a wide, blurry shot of the scene, and the busts of the characters will be added over top. Something similar is done with extended walking or travel scenes; just the legs of the character in question are shown while the scenery changes. Just something I noticed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, while Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji definitely can provide entertainment, laughs, and \u201cthe feels\u201d, it's definitely not for everyone. Kyouya's initial behaviour most certainly comes across as overly brusque at first. Take it from someone who was agonizing for hours over why she thought Ookami Shoujo was all right, though: he does get better, a lot better. As does the anime. Episode 8 and up ought to be pretty easy to get through, in fact, especially episode 10, which is probably my favourite, and really recommended if you want to see how tolerable the anime gets as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: Watch at your own risk and don't be afraid to leave your overly quick conclusions at the door.",

            "content": "I have to admit I have a certain something against shoujo, and this show reminds me why. It's so... generic. So generic in fact I have difficulty thinking what exactly to review. Unpopular, average girl is paired up with the school idol due to certain circumstances... what's not to love...?\r\nThe main character, Erika, is easily dismissed as another generic female lead. She has absolutely nothing to distinguish her--save her tendencies to lie, and I got to admit she has a sort of talent to it if she can keep up with the other two girls she hangs out with. I find her to be fairlyshallow, however, as she doesn't seem to mind having fake friends as long as she isn't alone, tends to dismiss her only actual friend, and made a certain remark about loners being losers that made me dislike her from the start.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, fine, that last one was personal.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast doesn't get any better. Kyouya is another hot dude with temper issues and who can come off as a jerkass, but has a hidden nice side usually revealed by petting cats, or in this case dogs. Oh, and bonus points for having a dark past. \\n\\n\r\nThe closest thing resembling an original character is Erika's friend, you see, and I can't even remember her name. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is okay-ish, nothing that stands out, sound is fairly generic. The story is... well, what story? So Kyouya covers Erika's lies and pretends to be his boyfriend while torturing her mercilessly in secret? And that's about it. The rest are overused devices such as the sick episode or the Declaration of Protection. And let's not forget about the main lead soothing the broody guy's heart and making him fall for her. Please.\\n\\n\r\nA highlight is the comedy. It legit made me laugh and the dynamics between characters weren't terrible. I actually kind of liked Kyouya, maybe because he tortured Erika, whom I despise, and I'm rather fond of the trolling type of people.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's... well. Just an anime swimming in the middle of mediocrity, relying solely on wish-fulfillment, a hot guy, and maybe some comedic value to be popular. Definitely not something that will make you think, but then again anime like these come in handy when all we want is to get out of reality.",

            "content": "It's a shame I feel such a desperate need to review this show, such desperation I'm willing to lose my review virginity for it. But rather than offering a critique, I'd like to address how this became the first show (after years of continuous anime watching), that I truly believe no one should ever watch. \r\nJust so my inevitable bias is clear, my core evaluation of a show is its story. Not necessarily the execution of story-telling, but it must have the basic idea of what its story is and how to navigate us through it to achieve its purpose. That being said, a kindergartneris capable of telling a story as simple as \"A man fell in a hole and then got up .\" Yes, this is an incredibly dumb story, its more of a statement than a story, but yet, its still better than Wolf Girl and Black Prince. \\n\\n\r\n(This will spoil the show, but it will save you from watching it, so don't mind)\\n\\n\r\nWolf Girl and Black Prince - literally translated by the anime into Liar Girl and Sadistic Hot Guy, follows the story of Erika, a girl who lies about dating hot guy Kyouya; the most mentally abusive male MC in Shoujo's- correction: anime's history. Yes, even worse than Asta. Our story revolves around hot guy Kyouya verbally abusing, threatening, and manipulating Erika's emotions to the point where he jokingly offers to buy her (his dog, which she herself accepts as being) a collar and a leash for Christmas, she is so grateful for his kind offer its the happiest we see her the entire show. This abuse climaxes soon after when Erika finally steps up and requests Kyouya to reciprocate to her feelings, which contrary to what you may expect, he does. He lets her know how its all been a tease, how he truly loves her and never meant to hurt her. Only to moments later shatter this by self-retorting (and I take a small liberty in translation for clarity sake):  \"I would never say anything like that moron, go fuck yourself\". Erika (thankfully) responds correctly by dumping water all over him. \\n\\n\r\nThey make up next episode, don't worry. BUT WAIT! They actually break up the next-next episode after Erika overhears our new main-man, the savior, the light to amend this disgusting relationship- Yuu, question Kyouya about his true feelings, which receives the appropriate response: \"She just my play-thing\" -Kyouka. Erika, hearing all this, lets Yuu know he's got a chance. After an episode or two of Yuu being kind and cheerful, making sure Erika is recovering from her abusive relationship, Erika decides she misses being called a dog and friend-zones him. Returning to Kyouko (and I'm not kidding) 10 seconds later. \\n\\n\r\nPause. So far Erika dealt with 3 men, the second I won't bother naming. hot guy Kyouko- who she had no interest in, and he just wanted someone to bully. Hot guy #2- Another playboy who protecced her and instantaneously asked her out knowing she had a boyfriend. After Erika gladly accepts and falls for him, letting him know Kyouko isn't a real boyfriend, he rejects her saying \"I just wanted to steal Kyouko-san's girl, who are you?\" -#2. Now here comes our boy Yuu- they have chemistry from the get-go. Erika notices him albeit his timidness and they have the first (and only) none-cringe male to female conversation in this show. He humbly admits he isn't as attractive and Kyouko, but with him she'll be respected, happy, cared-for, anything is better than being called someone's bitch... right? The only romance that ACTUALLY sprouted from \"normal\" love got shutdown so fast Erika fetching a stick for Kyouko lasted longer (Again, not joking). This is where I dropped.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was a smidgen of decent story telling I would've stuck along just get it over with, but the foreshadowing, pacing, character development, humor, the decisions, their thoughts, their actions, the FUCKING GOAL of the story were all so miserable I felt watching any further will result in irreversible brain damage. I kept blindly believing there must be some light at the end of this dark dark journey, but it just kept getting darker. I don't need to watch the rest to know Erika will be called a dog for the rest of her life and they'll live happily ever after- I watched half the show and this relationship was so forced down your throat there was nothing to look forward to. \\n\\n\r\nThis is a story of an abusive relationship being displayed with shiny lights- letting all the innocent teenage girl viewers know no matter how good of a guy you find, if he isn't the hottest human being you know, he isn't good enough. And if you somehow get this god-tier attractive boyfriend, no matter what he does to you, \"you can't help who you fall for\", so get used to his abuse, his awful personality, and likely cheating, and smile through it. This anime feeds on teenage girls thirst for being popular rather than a good romance, and keeps them on edge through use of the worst \"plot twists\" I have seen, half the plot twists are by definition abuse. \\n\\n\r\nI have watched many similar shows, and this by miles on miles on miles the worst thing I've ever seen from anime. -1/10. I don't doubt many young viewers had an 'attractiveness over anything' shoved into their beliefs because of this. This is a disservice to society.",

            "content": "If you were to go and browse my manga list, you would know that I read a lot of shoujo stories. As somebody who is no stranger to shoujo series, I am aware of their frequent portrayals of unhealthy and abusive relationships, which they oftentimes fail to frame for what they are: absolutely disgusting. Certain gross behaviors of the male love interest may be acknowledged as wrong, but those instances are often few and far between. Even worse, many times these abusive behaviors are framed to be interpreted as \u201cromantic\u201d or \u201cendearing\u201d. Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji is one of these types of stories, whichis why I absolutely despised it. \\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: I love shoujo series. There\u2019s a reason why my manga list is loaded with that sort of thing, and I try to keep in mind that shoujo stories are just fun, romantic escapist fantasies for young women. They don\u2019t have to be totally realistic, and many shoujo series that I actively enjoy don\u2019t have perfectly healthy relationships, but this series featured such a detestable main couple that it was never able to win me over. Also, just because I enjoy something doesn\u2019t mean I shouldn\u2019t acknowledge some of its more unsavory aspects. With that out of the way, let\u2019s get on with the review.\\n\\n\r\nThe story for this anime centers around Shinohara Erika, a 16 year old high school girl with a seeming inability to stop telling fibs that get her into trouble. From the get go, this is shown to be Erika\u2019s greatest weakness (and what would inevitably be the catalyst for even greater conflict later on in the show), as only a few minutes into the first episode, she tells a fib to a bunch of children, while trekking to school with her friend, about how she\u2019s a pro soccer player, which leads to her breaking a window after kicking the ball into the air. After the soccer fiasco, she makes it to school, where she doesn\u2019t have class with her best friend, and everybody else seems to already be in their respective groups. She eventually takes notice of two girls talking about their boyfriends and sex life, and our desperate heroine sees this as an opening to lie about her nonexistent boyfriend/sex life, in hopes that she would catch their attention and become their friend. She succeeds, and they talk for awhile, until they eventually start to catch on to her lies. Erica realizes this, and starts brainstorming ideas about keeping up appearances on her way home from school one day. Upon overhearing two women commenting on a guy\u2019s handsome appearance, she looks up to notice the guy she they were talking about. Thinking about how great it would be if he was only her boyfriend, she snaps a picture of him very closely and without his consent. Once she\u2019s caught by him, she runs away, hoping never to run into him again. Unfortunately for her, he goes to her school, and he\u2019s the extremely popular and well-liked \u201cprince\u201d, Sata Kyouya. This causes Erika to fall even deeper into the hole that she dug for herself. In an attempt to keep her lie going with her new freinds, she confesses what happened to Kyouya, hoping he\u2019ll understand and keep up the lie with her. He agrees to pretend to be her boyfriend, but only if she would be his \u201cdog\u201d, somebody who he could throw around and have bend to his will. \\n\\n\r\nTheir relationship already starts under abhorrent circumstances, but the events that ensue as she genuinely starts to fall in love with him and tries to desperately win him over made me feel an array of negative emotions ranging from deep sadness to extreme rage. He regularly screws with her already fragile emotions, uses her for his own gain (obvious given the circumstances of their relationship), and is just an all around cold, abusive asshole. When he isn\u2019t being cold towards her, his behavior is regularly aggressive, and that\u2019s usually during the moments where the show wrongly portrays their relationship as \u201cromantic\u201d. I guess when he tends to be cold towards her, aggression just seems \u201cwarm\u201d in contrast. The most rage-inducing moment in the show would have to be in episode 5, when Erika and Kyouya sit in a restaurant together after school, where she openly expresses wanting to go on a Christmas date with him. He responds by finally telling her that he loves her, saying that he would happily go on the date. After a constant relationship of cold, aggressive, and abusive mixed signals, she finally had her answer. He loved her, and she was overjoyed. However, that wasn\u2019t the case. After confessing his seemingly genuine feelings to her, he then snorts, saying it was all a lie, and telling her that she was stupid for getting her hopes up. After constantly tearing her apart emotionally, he gave her a glimmer of hope, and then tore that apart too. In one of the most cathartic moments in all of anime, she tearfully splashes the water she was drinking in his face, calling him \u201cgarbage\u201d. Once Christmas comes along, she sits in her room, alone. Despite the way he had treated her, she still loved him, and it was hard to let him go. Suddenly, she heard a knock on the door, and it was Kyouya. He ends up bursting into her room, deriding her for daring to call him \u201cgarbage\u201d (even though he did act like TOTAL garbage), and then proceeds to present her with a silver necklace, saying it\u2019s her \u201ccollar\u201d, and a sign that she \u201cbelongs to him.\u201d All of this was done aggressively (although my description of the scene should have made that obvious) and I think the way he treated her at the restaurant vs. the way he treated her on Christmas is the best part of the show that I can use to describe the cold/aggressive dichotomy that Kyouya displays. One second he has no interest at all and intentionally tears her down to make it seems like he doesn\u2019t like her, and then the next thing you know, he\u2019s at her house on Christmas and angrily presenting her with a \u201ccollar\u201d because she \u201cbelongs to him\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nAfter he presents her with the necklace, she breaks down crying. I think the show was trying to portray her crying as \u201ctears of happiness\u201d, and wanted the audience to believe that Kyouya\u2019s gesture was romantic. Instead, I just felt depressed. All I saw in that scene was a girl\u2019s mental state breaking down because she was confused, abused, and didn\u2019t know what to think anymore. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m sure it wouldn\u2019t be hard to guess that Kyouya\u2019s actions are explained through his \u201ctragic past\u201d. It may have been true that Kyouya was cold towards her because he was afraid of attachment and making a genuine romantic connection, which was In turn due to his general fear of abandonment and worry that those who he loved would leave him, but it doesn\u2019t justify his actions towards Erika. Sure, it may make his character just a bit more sympathetic, but not by much. He does become slightly more tolerable by the end of the series, but since he\u2019s still an abrasive asshole by that point, I can\u2019t say that I ever grew to like him. Overall, the story and the main couple in this show (you know, the protagonists who we\u2019re supposed to root for) were so painful to watch that I couldn\u2019t ever give this series a positive score.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation both look standard for a 2014 shoujo anime. It\u2019s average and nothing phenomenal. The music, on the other hand, is pretty great. The opening theme is a fun and catchy little J-Pop tune, and the ending theme is more of the same, but both songs sound above average, to be sure (although that just might be my taste in music speaking). Ookami Heart, the ending theme, is the better song of the two, and I highly suggest you go watch the music video for it. Its got a fun, bright retro aesthetic, and all 3 minutes of it is 100 times better than every episode of this anime combined! This song is seriously the only reason I gave this show a 2/10.\\n\\n\r\nOokami to Shoujo to Kuro Ouji is one of the most infuriating pieces of media I\u2019ve ever consumed. Even as a die-hard shoujo fanatic, I really can\u2019t recommend this to anyone at all. This show hurt to watch, and for your sanity, I\u2019d recommend that you stay away from this anime.",

            "content": "Ok, after watching 7 episodes of this show I dropped it in pure disgust. For some reason I had the idea that \"Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji\" would be simiular to \"Class president is a Maid!\" (which I  loved), but boy was wrong. Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji made me feel at such unease that I felt compelled to write a review about why I disliked it so much. This review may contain minor spoliers to exemplify my grave distaste of the show. So let\u00b4s begin.\r\nStory: 1/10\r\nThe storyline of \"Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji\" are how the girl Erika is trying to fit inin a group of superfical girls at high school, and makes up a story that she has a boyfriend. The boy in question is the schools hottie (Sata) that every girl at the school drowls over. Sata agrees to play along with Erikas lie for his own reasons (basically to use her as a slave to do whatever he wants her to do, to satisfy his own dark needs). Sounds a little bit intresting right? But it soon turns out to by pathetic story about a girl with no other desire then the to make the cruel and cold boy to love her, and does anything to get his love. It comes to the point that Erikas highlight of the week is that she\u00b4s getting a pet on the head because she was a good dog and fetched whatever it was he wanted (it\u00b4s actually is illustrated by Erika with ears and a wiggeling tail). It gave my gag reflexes. But hey, the poor Sata had a childhood experince that made him sadstic and cruel so it\u00b4s ok right? I actually found myself screaming at Erika that, yes, you are stupied and have no selfrespect or selfesteam at all. Even the comedy became a place for Erika to further humiliate herself.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe only good thing about the show. Cant blame decent art for the catastrophic story. The characters are nicley drawn and the backgrounds fill their purpuse (to be the stage of this \"love\" story). \\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nCan\u00b4t remember so much of the music due to my horror of how the show played out. OP was ok but that nothing that stood out. Otherwise voice acting was fine but nothing I could appriciate. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\r\nI have all ready been talking about the characters a bit due to that the story pretty much only are character based. But I will elaborate a bit more.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we have Erika, your average high school girl whos only worries is to fit in and not be lonely at high school. Nothing wrong with that but it\u00b4s more important to her to fit in than get actual friends (even do she has ha great best friend, Sanda). Later on the only thing in the world that\u00b4s important to Erika is to upgrade from dog to girlfriend status to Sata. She is also a pathological liar whom later gives the advice to others \"to be true to them selfs\". Otherwise I really cant say much about her, because her whole beeing centers aorund Sata. Yes, didn\u00b4t finish the show so I can\u00b4t tell if there are any major character development for Erika, but I dout that. Once a masochist always a masochist. \\n\\n\r\nThen we have Sata... Yes, he is very good looking and appears to others as a gentleman but his true colors are really dark. He clearly enjoys to make others feel small and useless. He actually gets seroius kicks of making Erika run for sticks like a dog and do other humiliating things. Sata is also very controlling which screams \"psychopath\" long way. He doesnt use words like love, but states that things (oh I meen Erika) belongs to him. He actually claimed once in the show \"that he didn\u00b4t liked that a guy made Erika cry for now good reason, because she belonged to him\". But he himself makes Erika cry like 5 times each episode. He creeped me out.\\n\\n\r\nCan\u00b4t really say anything good or bad about the supporting crew, which only function seems to be contribute to the MC\u00b4s \"love\" story in some way. We have the best friends that give advices and listens to the MC\u00b4s complains, the guys whos function is to make Sata jealues and a superfical girls group which competes for \"I have the best boyfriend and best relationship\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nAbsolutly no enjoyment for me. Episode 1 gave some potentail to a bit wierd but intresting story but falls all ready in epsiode 2 for me.. After that I was just horrified.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\r\nThe only thing that makes me give it a 2 instead of 1 is the art, which was pretty good. It gives me nightmares that young girls watch this and starts idolize cruel psycho dudes whos only attributes is good looks and if you \"hang\" in there long enough and do whatever he wants he will some day love you.",

The beginning was very interesting, seeing Sata and Shinohara getting to know each other, and dealing with Sata's demanding and ownership towards Shinohara. It was quite an adventure. I would totally watch this again.\r\n[ART]\r\n-----------\r\nThe effort the producers put into the graphics in this anime must've been very rough, in a good way of course. The quality of this anime was very high quality, and I loved it. Everything was well created, especially the nature and scenery.\r\n[SOUND]\r\n-----------\r\nI'm not sure if there is a dubbed version for this anime, but the subbed version was fantastic! Sata's voice actor did a very fantasticjob of showing his true colors. His demanding tone really set a very dark and mysterious vibe in this anime.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nThe only characters I found well animated and created was Sata and Nozomi. Every other character in this anime didn't really suit their personality. \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nI really did enjoy this anime. Seeing Sata and Shinohara's rough situations, and seeing them get off and on relationships with each other was sure an adventure. I think a lot of people who have relationship problems can learn a lot from this anime, of course, this is only an opinion. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was very well made, but it wasn't perfect. Every anime has it's downsides. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE:\\n\r\n9/10 for red eyed Sata",

            "content": "\"She is my loyal dog\" How would you feel if your 'boyfriend' said that about you? Well that is what Kyoya, the most popular boy at school, calls Erika. After lying about have a boyfriend to her friends, Erika asks Kyoya to be her 'boyfriend'. Thus the torture begins.\r\nStory- This is show puts the RomCom genre's traditional story line in a shredder. This story is so original and unpredictable that you have to love it. It has few cliches and even fewer plot holes. The show will keep you laughing and screaming.\r\nArt- The art does shine very well in this show. For an example, conversation.Multiple times during the show characters will talk as they walk. When this happens the background will show various shots of the setting. The character will show up with a vivid colored shadow. The color us is great\\n\\n\r\nSound- I really love the music in this anime. The opening and ending both capture the upbeatness of the show. They sounf nice as indivisuals, yet they bring the story together. The characters' voice actors went out with themselves. Every voice is perfect for the characters. I'm really hoping for a dub\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- The main couples' characters are spot on. You have the black prince, Kyoya. To everyone he his charming and kind. But he is really a jerk sometimes. He does gets jealous easily and does care about Erika. Erika is the one of the funniest characters in the show. She try her best to make the best of her situation. The other characters in the show aren't given much depth. They are just there and then leave. If you going to have a person be the friend of the MCs' friends, give them a history.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- This is one of my favorite anime. I laughed so hard at it I cried. I've scream so much out of pure hatreds at some points that my throat hurt. I really got into this one. The ending is almost perfect. Another read the manga ending. I just thing that they are so cute. I dd wish they did things a bit differently, but WTH, it was awesome.",

And its one of my favourite Fall2014 anime . Ookami Shoujo is a really unpopular anime in Japan probably because of how Sata treats Erika in this series.\r\nSata gives off an impression of a 'Prince' , so happy and always being nice to people , never showing his unhappy side , which is so surreal . Sata treated her like a dog , in return for him acting as Erika'sfake boyfriend. But slowly on in the series , Sata began to develop feelings for Erika . He said that Erika was really different from the other girls , because she likes him for who he is inside and outside , unlike other girls who just like him based on how hot he looks .\\n\\n\r\nPeople kept making fun of Sata dating Erika , because a hot guy like him can find a girlfriend easily as girls will just invite themself to him but yet he is sticking with Erika who is a very plain girl. He used to not take interest in any girls and Erika was the first.He treats her pretty bad . When Erika asks him to go out with her he will just say its a pain and he doesn't like it , many reasons but yet he goes along with it . Always saying stuffs that hurts her when he actually really care and likes her . But he just doesn't want to show it .",

A lot of the times I had been in similar situations and so it made it all the more funny. \\n\r\nAnyone you enjoys it should check out the manga which is still ongoing under the original title OOKAMI SHOUJO TO KURO OUJI :)",

It's basically a copy of every. single. bad boy/jerk likes nice girl anime EVER. Nothing special about it. Nothing great. It's just another copy.

Art is decent, slightly below average. Sound is fine. Characters are average, a bit annoying at times. Enjoyment? Depends on what you want. Overall, mediocre af- and that's being generous.",

Which means it takes place in a high school, where the average, not so popular girl falls for the super popular guy, who has a tragic backstory! Gasp! Such drama! Much wow!\r\n...not.\r\nStory 3/10\r\nHow disappointing. The first episode, while seemingly cliche,  made the show appear to be pretty interesting. A girl who has the terrible trait of lying. A sadist and a masochist! But once Erika falls for Kyouya... siiighh.\r\nAlso, Erika isn't a masochist. A masochist is someone who actually enjoys pain and torment. She does not.\r\nArt and Animation 8/10\r\nPretty damn good, if I have to say. It's nice andcolorful, and the character designs are nothing to sneeze at. Kyouya's design, in particular, is... damn. He fine af.\\n\r\nAnimation is average. It's perfectly fine for what the genre is.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic is fine. OP is pretty good, ED is... eh. \\n\r\nI personally found Erika's voice to be grating and irritating at times. Especially when she cried- which happened a lot because, remember! This is a typical shoujo romance!\\n\r\nYet, I will still give sound a 5 because I am totally biased towards Sakurai's voice. Damn it, man! WHY DID YOU HAVE TO VOICE SUCH A DOUCHEBAG?!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10\\n\\n\r\nSo bad. I could not stand anyone in this show. Erika was actually a bit likeable at first. I enjoyed that she was a compulsive liar. It showed she wasn't perfect and was just human. And I found her pretty relatable when she had some awkward moments. Yet, her likeability went out the window when she failed to grow a spine.\\n\r\nShe allowed herself to be manipulated and abused (physically and emotionally) by this dude just because she believes she's in love with him. Sigh.\\n\r\nKyouya is an asshat. He's your typical popular anime dude with a tragic backstory. I personally don't believe his past experiences can excuse his abusive behavior, but whatever.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show had its funny moments,  especially in the first half. Yet, the show becomes pretty painful to watch as we see Erika metaphorically castrate herself over and over, allowing this man's abuse just so she can win his love.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show reminded why I tend to have so many issues with shoujo anime. Weak and spineless heroines, douchebag bishies... sigh. Yet despite everything, I continue to come back to this genre, even when it constantly continues to pump out generic stuff like this. If you're new to shoujo, I guess you could enjoy this since it wouldn't be something you have seen over and over again. Otherwise, stay away. There are better things to watch.",

            "content": "Okay, let\u2019s get things straight here. I really want to meet with the creator and discuss why on earth did she/he/they come up with such revolting plot and characters. Why so much hate on women? Please, tell me. I\u2019d really like to know. \r\nI\u2019m in awe that this show is even popular to begin with. And being popular amongst the female audience? That hurts more. \r\nThe main guy is a sadistic jerk who treats the main female lead like a slave and somehow everyone is gaining happy feels from this? HOW? And, WHY? \r\nThe main female lead is obviously made to look dumb, no surprisethere, but being dumb is no reason to accept bondage to a jerk solely out of avoiding loneliness? She was pulled around like a dog by making errands, being \u201cpetted\u201d and even made to fetch. The only thing missing was her collar. There\u2019s nothing lovey-dovey about being in an abusive relationship with someone who treats you worse than an insect. But, no \u2026 she is going to fall in love with that arse. Love truly must be blind in this case. \\n\r\nThe only reason I watched this was because I kept seeing few people online praise this and I also came across some well-thought negative reviews. I didn\u2019t want to judge the anime based off reviews alone so I decided to give it a try. What a huge mistake. I couldn\u2019t proceed with more than 4 episodes. I was gritting my teeth throughout the show and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll start having bruxism because of this. The entire series was too demeaning to watch as a woman. And as an anime fan, I\u2019m extremely disappointed in the industry for creating such rubbish. I would have rated this in the negatives, if possible, but +1 goes out for the animation \u2014 the only positive light seen.",

            "content": "In media, romance is depicted as sort of an uphill slope, and at the top of this slope is usually getting together with someone the character loves. Along the way, there\u2019s the occasional rival love interest, a few misunderstandings, quarrels, and other typical roadblocks. Watching the climb to attain someone\u2019s love is enjoyable, at least when that climb is executed right. \r\nWhen it comes to anime, this formula is pretty prevalent, and it\u2019s especially used in shoujo-esque shows. Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji is yet another shoujo that\u2019s a prime example of this climb, yet the rocky road that\u2019s portrayed in this anime is ratherdifferent than most shows. In fact, it\u2019s what makes this show just a little bit more unique than the standard romance fare.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the show is simple. Our female protagonist, Erika Shinohara, is a high school student who doesn\u2019t feel as if she has many friends in her class. In order to make some, she pretends to have a boyfriend, and ends up befriending two conceited girls in her class, both who have boyfriends of their own. However, once Erika realizes that this \u2018boyfriend\u2019 that she made up goes to her own school, she convinces him to be her fake boyfriend so she can keep her friends. The catch? Her new fake boyfriend, Kyoya Sata, is a sadist who pretty much turns Erika into his servant. Hilarity ensues...but not really.\\n\\n\r\nThe basis of this show is actually as vain as some of the characters themselves. The fact that our female protagonist puts up with abuse just so she could keep a couple of friends is cringe-worthy, and having to watch how Kyoya treats her is painful in itself. Along with this, the show has a system of individually introducing us to a certain character each episode, with the subplot of the episode adding a little bit of substance to the main plot, and Erika and Kyoya\u2019s relationship as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nThe redeeming factor of the story, nonetheless, is how the main plot (which is basically Erika and Kyoya\u2019s relationship) develops. In the latter half of the show, our two leads begin to open up to each other gradually, and what spawns from this is a somewhat believable relationship. You can\u2019t exactly ignore the abuse in the beginning, though, and that\u2019s what puts a big damper on the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this show is...well, how do I put this lightly? It\u2019s not too bad, but it\u2019s far from great, either. It feels sloppily done, almost as if the animators were rushing to get everything finished. Movements look rather stiff, and in some cases where characters are talking, it looks as if their lips aren\u2019t exactly moving. However, it gets the job done, and it doesn\u2019t deter too much from the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style, on the other hand, has a lot of problems that definitely need to be addressed. First of all, the colors that are used within the show are dull and lacking a lot of vibrance. That isn\u2019t too much of a problem, considering that a lot of viewers don\u2019t care for flashy visuals and a broad use of colors. But when you have a show where some characters may have oddly colored hair or eyes (take Kyoya and his red eyes, or Ayumi and her pinkish hair), dull colors feel out of place. Ookami Shoujo also has a bit of a love affair with weird, grotesque-looking faces, probably due to a limited budget. In some instances, someone\u2019s eyes may larger than usual, or someone\u2019s lips may look oddly long from a profile view. It\u2019s visually unappealing, and easily noticeable. I\u2019m usually not that picky when it comes to art, but Ookami Shoujo particularly irked me, and most likely annoyed plenty of other viewers.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s OST was nothing special, but it served as another redeeming factor in an anime that has numerous faults. It blended in nicely with the background and atmosphere, especially when it was used during tense or sad moments. Some tracks were repetitive, and there\u2019s a certain soundtrack piece that was practically used almost every episode, slightly taking away from its likeability each time it was played.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes deserve special mention. The show\u2019s opening, \u2018LOVE GOOD TIME\u2019, is reminiscent of 2000\u2019s pop punk, and was a refreshing throwback to some of the music I used to listen to when I was younger. The ending theme, \u2018Ookami Heart\u2019, is one of my favorite endings from the Fall 2014 season. The electropop-esque beat, along with nice vocals, easily makes it very enjoyable and fun to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting was solid, to say the least, and easy on the ears. Kyoya\u2019s seiyuu, Sakurai Takahiro, did a fantastic job at portraying Kyoya\u2019s sadistic side, as well as his fake-nice side. Besides this, most of the voice acting was good, but nothing noteworthy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Ookami Shoujo are quite possibly one of the show\u2019s biggest faults. We have our female lead, Erika, who comes off as desperate, annoying, and overbearing, at least when she\u2019s around Kyoya or her friends, Marin and Aki. It\u2019s hard to feel the slightest bit of empathy for her when she doesn\u2019t even try to stand up for herself against Kyoya, or anyone else for that matter. As the show progresses, she becomes more and more tolerable, and this shows through interactions with various other characters. Albeit, she whines more than necessary, and she tends to put the needs of Kyoya before anyone else\u2019s (including herself!), but her development overshadows these negatives.\\n\\n\r\nNext, we have our male lead, Kyoya, who\u2019s about as loving as a rock. Watching him mercilessly abuse Erika almost made me want to murder him through my computer screen, but in the beginning of the series, he has a few moments where he lets his guard down and becomes just a little kinder; those little moments almost made me forget that he was an awful human being. Along with Erika, he receives development in the form of becoming nicer to those around him, without having to pretend. At the end of the series, he\u2019s still sort of a douchebag, but at least he made an effort to change.\\n\\n\r\nOur supporting characters are pretty weak and barely make any appearances. Like I mentioned before, we\u2019re introduced to these characters episodically, and their only purpose is to strengthen the main relationship, with the exception of Ayumi, Marin, and Aki. There\u2019s a few characters who only appear for an episode, then disappear for the rest of the series, and some come back into the show to give advice to Kyoya and Erika. The worst part about tossing aside these characters is that they\u2019re actually miles more interesting than our two leads, and at least were more entertaining in the long run.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d be lying if I said that I wholeheartedly did not enjoy this show. It has it merits, like its relaxing soundtrack, the wonderful opening and ending, and a few genuinely funny moments. However, a lot of the negative things I discussed earlier outweigh a lot of the pros of this show, and a few episodes left me relieved due to the fact that it was finally over.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOokami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji is not for everyone. It romanticizes abusive relationships, and basically screams, \u201cPUT UP WITH ABUSE AND YOU\u2019LL PROBABLY GET A BOYFRIEND OUT OF IT!\u201d. The lackluster animation and art, the uninspired plot, and the unbearable main characters are enough to drive anyone away after the first episode. Nevertheless, for those who stick around, you\u2019ll get to witness decent development that can make up for the rocky start in the beginning, depending on how you look at it. Ookami Shoujo is far from the best shoujo in recent years, but if you\u2019re willing to look beyond its plentiful faults, give this show a shot.\\n\\n\r\n(This is my first review, so constructive criticism is absolutely welcome!)\\n",

            "content": "Not only awful, but quite frankly, sort of disturbing.\r\nI don't pretend pretend to be an expert on psychology, but I would be legitimately interested in hearing an actual psychologist's thoughts on this show, because even to a layman, it's concerning. A quick look at the synopsis will give you the basic outline: Our main character, Erika, lies about going out with the guy she took a picture of, and in order for him play along, she has to become his \"dog\". Before going any further, I have a couple side notes in regards to some of the absurdities that lie within that statement. First ofall, if the \"reward\" is as meager as MAYBE increasing two strangers' opinions of you, why take the \"risk\" with this gigantic lie? Also, who walks to within arms-length of a stranger on the street to \"secretly\" take a picture of them? Worst paparazzi ever. But I digress.\\n\\n\r\nIt's time to talk about the most important part to any romcom: the two leads. As previously mentioned, the main character is Erika. She is a real dud of an MC. Plain, boring, uninteresting, unmemorable, you name it. She is one of those \"blank slate\", self-insert insert characters whose only noteworthy trait is a \"big heart\" (which is the case for like 90% of protagonist btw).\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there is Kyouya, the good-looking love interest that has everyone fooled with his \"nice guy act\". Oh man. They say there is a thin line between \"tsundere\" and \"cruel\", and he crossed that line and just kept going and going and going. While a tsundere like Otani from Lovely Complex manages to be harsh but never quite sadistic, and even maintains a bit of charm, Kyoua fails miserably. Of course, near the end of the season, the show made an attempt to explain why he turned out the way he did, but this supposedly sad backstory was insultingly unoriginal and didn't even come close to succeeding at explaining his behavior.\\n\\n\r\nSo we have the boring self-insert MC and the hot psychopath. Let's see how this plays out. Predictably, and despite all the abuse she takes, Erika develops feelings for him. The fact she would fall in love with someone so loathsome with no redeeming qualities besides their looks, speaks volumes about her character. But what about Kyouya's feelings? Of course at first, they can only be described as hostile, but in a shocking twist, he eventually reciprocates her feelings. Again, you might ask, why? Because she's the main character and the plot demanded it. That's the only rational explanation. He already mentioned how many had unsuccessfully attempted the \"nice girl\" act on him to try to win his heart, so it's not as if she was doing anything revolutionary. So yeah, this pairing makes zero sense any way you look at it.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, more than anything, this anime sends so many poor messages. \"Hey, if I take enough mental and emotional abuse, and basically turn into someone's metaphorical punching bag, maybe I can date someone that is more attractive than me!\" That's the biggest message this anime sends to its audience. Whether you're a guy or girl, hot or not, I sincerely hope there aren't any impressionable teenagers watching these characters and trying to emulate either of them.\\n\\n\r\nI can definitively say the Story, Character, and Enjoyment are all a 1/10. The art and sound, though, are not so bad. I'll give them both a 6/10. It's generally a pretty aesthetically-pleasing show to look at, and as bad a person as I think Kyouya is, his character design is unique enough to be memorable. I also think his VA, Takahiro Sakurai, did a nice job at portraying his coldness and hostility without being too cartoon-ish. I can't really say any of the other seiyuus jumped out at me, but it wasn't bad.\\n\\n\r\nTime to put a bow on this review, though. So, how do you make an anime that is not only bad, but also makes the world a worse place because of its mere existence? Maybe you should ask the creators of Wolf Girl & Black Prince, because they nailed it.",

            "content": "I've been an a bit of a shojo bender lately and decided to watch this. Boy was that a mistake. This takes things I'm not a huge fan of in the genre and ramps them up to 11.\r\nStory: In its basic form, the story is simple. Insecure girl goes to high school and wants to make friends and fit in. She also meets a hot tsudere guy and bends over backwards for him. But it takes things to extremes. Like S&M extremes. And it feels like borderline torture to see the protagonist go back to said tsudere over and over again. Their almost parasitic relationshipis also infuriating. It got to the point that I dropped this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: The art is fine. It's not a masterpiece, but it isn't garbage either. Same thing with the sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Where do I even begin with this. The protagonist Erika is annoying to say the least. She's an insecure pathological liar who is also a masochist. Wonderful(note the sarcasm). She's also doggedly persistent and possesses more than a little misplaced confidence. She voluntarily subjects herself to emotional abuse and isn't afraid to do something humiliating to make the male lead happy. In short I don't find her likable at all. If anything I find her pathetic.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as annoying as Erika is, she's not the worst character. Not by a long shot. That particular honor goes to said stereotypical bishounen tsudere, Kyoya. Like many male leads in shojos before him, he is a grade A asshole. But he's not just an asshole; he's also a sadist. He messes with Erika and degrades her constantly. And unlike most tsuderes who have some redeeming qualities, I've yet to find any in him. He's mean and cruel at least 95% of the time. It doesn't help that he's also the abuser in this extremely unhealthy relationship.\\n\\n\r\nAll the other characters are either flat or bland as hell. There's also little if any character development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I've wasted several hours of my life that I'll never get back. That should say enough.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Don't touch this thing with a ten foot pole unless you are a masochist yourself.",

Even in the anime we see belittled female. \u0421learly defined sexism. Who calls girl the dog? Tell that to the girl and you don\"t talk to her. Maybe there are girls who like such a humiliating attitude, but it's worth noting that we are not watching this. Ican advise vital anime in this genre Bokura wa Minna Kawaisou. 3/10.",

            "content": "Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji    **I'll try to keep it spoiler free**\r\nWhere to begin?? I started watching this anime with high hopes, but what I got is a disappointing mess that I regret watching.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe premise of Ookami was strong enough to pull me in, however it failed to deliver. The anime is only 12 eps so the story feels rushed. Personally I feel as if the anime didn't emphasise enough on Kyoya treating her like a 'dog' (although it is clear Kyoya is an a**hole) and instead placed to much emphasis on Erika chasing after Kyoya. The whole relationship between Erikaand Kyoya is also confusing. After watching all episodes I couldn't actually find a concrete reason as to why Erika fell in love with Kyoya except for the fact that Kyoya is 'hot'. Sure they're are times where Kyoya did sorta act like a boyfriend but those moments where overshadowed when he acted like an 'a**hole'\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art of the anime was actually one of its strong point. The characters look great aswell as the background, although there are times (in the last few eps) where the characters (esp Kyoya) look a bit off. Nothing to complain about though\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nPretty standard for an anime, nothing too special although the track which plays during the 'sweet' moments is nice\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nThis was one of the most infuriating aspects of the show. \\n\\n\r\nErika has got to be one of the worst MC I've ever seen. She is way too simple and is tricked waaay to easily. I know she is supposed to be your average teenage school girl but seriously no-one can be that stupid. She seems to lack any form of pride and I felt a lot of the time she was voluntary degrading herself for Kyoya. Her character is too clingy and the way she can be so easily won over is puzzling. Her character basically represents the opposite of female empowerment. \\n\\n\r\nKyoya's character I would say is polarizing. The way he treats Erika is extremely dislikable however there are thing such as background context to consider. Your view of him does fluctuate through the series however most of the time you'll be hating his Tsundere-like character. Whenever he enters 'Prince' mode is pretty amusing though.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are fine I suppose but no-one really stands out. Lol cheers to Sanda as being the only logical character in this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nI actually did not find much enjoyment in this show. The show does have it moments however they are rare. Watching Erika's stupidity and embarrassing moments for 12 episodes straight, combined with Kyoya's antagonistic nature was tiring and frustrating,  A lot of cringeworthy moments in this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nPersonally, I would not recommend this anime. For me the character of Erika totally shut down any chances of me liking it. Its not completely 'unwatchable' but.. I dont think you'll get much out of watching this anime. If you're looking for a sweet romantic comedy, I suggest you look elsewhere",

            "content": "Before I watched this anime I read through some reviews and the plot summary and ended up thinking I would get an anime about a lying average girl and a kind of sadistic good-looking guy but don't misunderstand, the anime is very different from what you may initially expect.\r\nStory - the story is very fast-paced (very very fast paced, imo) which in the case of this anime is a good thing. The plot moves along just fine and because of it being fast-paced you get more from this anime than you would originally expect. That does not mean it is totally without clich\u00e9s (that's whyit is 9 out of 10 points for the story)\\n\\n\r\nArt - I just love the art of this anime. It is nice to look at, the colours are wonderful and the comedy as well as the romantic and touching scenes in the anime are made really really well.\\n\\n\r\nSound - Even if I like the OP or ED of an anime, I normally skip through it after watching it 2 or 3 times...this is actually the very first anime where I watched the OP for every. single. episode. Never happened to me before. The OP (and the ED) were just perfect for the anime and the sounds and background music of the anime was just right. 10 points!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - This was one of the areas where I got something totally unexpected from this anime. I thought (after reading the reviews) I would get nearly no character development and just your average shoujo characters. If that were the case I would have probably not completed the anime and started hating the characters, but the truth is, I just love them - all of them. There is just enough character development without making them do a 180\u00b0 change. Note, that this is one of the few anime were you can actually see something like a male tsundere!!! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - this anime was pure enjoyment for me. I laughed, cried, giggled, yelled and just jumped in front of the screen all the time. Seriously, it was so much fun!\\n\\n\r\nOverall - overall it gets 9 points because I would love to give it a 10 points but seriously it is not a must-watch for everyone. It should be a must-watch for everyone who like romantic comedy anime!",

            "content": "Hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to what's gonna be an unpopular review for 2 reasons.\r\n1)This anime seems to be controversial and 2)because it features broken as fuck characters as the main attraction.\r\nNow these 2 reasons might seem a bit vague but worry not as i'll explain the idiocy behind people's hatred for this anime later on.\r\nSo off with the story where we meet Erika who struggles to fit in with her classmates and resorts to making shit up to make herself seem more interesting than she is. That's something we all do whether we like it or not, we lie to make a possiblemate fall more deeply for us or to a newfound friend in order to make him/her think we are badass or something. But as is the case most of the time, lies come back to bite you in the ass, and that's what happened with Erika who bragged about having a hot boyfriend who also happens to be into S&M(no not Metallica's album) and all that crap..So her friends asked for evidence, a photo or something cause that's a healthy reaction, right?\\n\\n\r\nLong story short she found a total stranger and took his photo without him knowing and surprise surprise he attended the same school as her..And not only that but he is well known to every female cause he's hooooooooot. So she asked him to pretend to be her boyfriend in order to avoid being labeled as a liar.. And being the good person that he is he accepted but there was one term...For her to be his dog.. Not literally of course with a costume and leash and everything, i mean his pet or slave or something like that. So he is a sadist and a douche the likes of which the world has never seen and she is the masochist who endures his abuse.\\n\\n\r\nFrom there on we bear witness to the \"couple's\" day to day life where Kyouya finds new and interesting ways to amuse himself on the expense of Erika and Erika being the idiot that she is doesn't want to break things off and continues with her lie cause she felt that her friends would stop talking to her or some crap.\\n\\n\r\nI quite understand her stance BUT to a certain degree..I'm what you'd call not a social animal per se and i don't like people..Especially the stupid sort, cause it feels like i'm wasting my precious time in life to engage into pointless discussions with people i don't like or don't even care if they drop dead in front of me. But i wasn't always like that..There was a time when i was a wee lad and felt like i needed to belong somewhere. Being a fat cynical fuck didn't help much but i found my way.. But other people aren't me and that pressure and fear of being alone makes them do and say things that don't comply with their personality.\\n\\n\r\nWith that in mind i can somewhat relate to her and her situation although after she achieved her goal of deceiving her friends she could have easily ended her pretend relationship with Kyouya. In fact she had quite many chances to do so and she didn't..And here my friends comes the part where i get all angry and philosophical at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nRemember a little keyword i used somewhere in the review? The word is abuse..Now abuse can be physical or mental. I don't like physical abuse towards women and if you do such things i hope you die a very long and painful death. I know women can be hard to live with but it's not like they have it easy, you know and hitting them is NEVER the answer.. Granted i'm not saying they never give you a reason, in fact they themselves abuse the fact that most men won't even think of hitting them in any way so they can throw drinks at you if you say the wrong thing..BUT NEVER EVER do we choose this road.\\n\\n\r\nMental abuse? Well that's another story and one that's too complicated to fit into this review..But in this specific instance i can hardly say that this is abuse..Is he being a monumental dick? OH YES. Is his behaviour a product of past experiences? Damn yeah sister! I do that too to a certain extend..I grew up in a family where my father was hitting my mother and in fear that maybe one day i might become him i try to push others away from me and because i've been fucked in the ass by past relationships i also tend to be hard on possible mates to see if they can actually be with me..Not just the funny-happy me but also the dark me, the one that i try to suppress everyday, the one i love to hate, the one that has existential issues..In other words i'm broken and so are many people out there and we try to get by each day and if we are lucky we'll find someone who can take our bullshit and make them something better, make us better.\\n\\n\r\nWith that also in mind i can relate to Kyouya and some of his behavioral traits. I can see and understand why he is being such a fucking douche to Erika and don't forget that it was her that asked him to play this game of lies and it was her that was using him for her own purposes. And at the same time i can relate to Erika because she is weak and passive with no actual experience of her own and ends up being a victim of her own actions.\\n\\n\r\nSo you got 2 broken people who don't know better, a fake relationship and a willingness to make things work but no actual way of doing so due to inexperience and behavioral issues that are way too deep to explore.\\n\\n\r\nNow this whole situation seems to strike a chord into the hearts of 2 cases of people(which i shall name afterwards) cause they hyperbolize the situation these fictional characters are in and they also put their emotions in front of logic and surely enough they're being hypocritical twats.\\n\\n\r\nThe 2 cases are radical feminazis and people(both men and women)who live in a bubble and can't handle hard situations..Basically adult babies who want the world to be a big shelter for them and their stupid babylike behavior. Now these people almost certainly never had any relationship in their lives-let alone a hard one-or they're in one where they lie to themselves, believing that all is fine when in fact they are in an abusive relationship..Just don't want to admit it..And that's sad to me..What's even more sad is imposing your own situation and belief system to a product of fiction that tries admirably to face an issue head on..I''ve never felt that this anime romanticizes mental abuse..Mental abuse is something way worse that this light depiction of events we are shown in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nLet me say this again for the people who can't make apples from oranges..Being mentally abusive to someone is saying things that carry such weight,hitting in the soft spot, to make the other part davastated to the point of meltdown and that other part has no way of leaving you for something better..Mental abuse is about control much like physical abuse..Compare that to the anime where  the so called abuse is a means of communication.That communication comes in form of a facade from Kyouya's part to tell her not to get involved with him seriously thus the dog-master game to show her even more how damaged goods he is and from Erika's part a means to communicate that she has seen through his bullshit and likes him for what he trully is and what he can be not just to her but to himself. Add to that that Kyouya never tries to control her life and even went as far as to tell her to see other people besides him.\\n\\n\r\nBut some will say that she is weak and has no choice and HAS to deal with this cause reasons..True this happens all the time in real life but this is not the case here, is it? She HAS a choice and power to deliver this choice. See the difference between not being able and being able but CHOOSE not to...This is called-in case your iq is below the freezing temps-choice..And people whether you like it or not can choose to be with people who are dicks or cunts..Choices people, remember that cause you've mixed terms up. And if you have your terms and definitions fucked up we can't have a discussion about anything.\\n\\n\r\nNow as i said Kyouya is definitely a dick and a big one at that, even more he doesn't know when to stop and that's where Erika shows her balls of steel and hammers him to the wall..True enough that not only takes balls but also a toll on you..And that's a state that's shown in a very expressive manner throughout this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo to sum it up 2 broken people,a lie that brought them together eventually and these 2 people's journey through trial and error to make it work.That's a relationship in a nutshell..The fact that you don't always choose who you'll fall for, the fact that that person won't be the ideal partner or even the ideal person for that matter, the fact that relationships are not just a product of love but also hardship and the brutal truth that happiness is something earned when you crawl in the mud..Happiness cannot be commanded to be happiness it just happens in between all the shit you have to work out.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe i'm wrong and that's why i hope this review brings the discussion to my digital doorstep. Cause i trully believe that this anime can bring all us fucks together to work things out and learn from one another.\\n\\n\r\nOnto the animation then..Nice and crispy and colorful but not something that is great by any means..It's just a decent enough animation with generic character design or in some cases no design at all by the looks of things..I mean you can see the difference in how the main cast is drawn and how the secondary is.\\n\\n\r\nOP and ED are generic as well nothing to be surprised about..VA were on point and never faltered.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all i think you should watch this cause this is one of the few anime that has down to earth people in down to earth situations and what's more the whole package is believable and relatable and you can actually connect to the cast for once. Like i said if you go into this bringing your hypocritical fake rage you won't like it but if you are sane then this is just for you.\\n",

I like how there is still love in it, but the main guy character keeps it from being too sugary. The best line is when he said something about throwing her out a window. I may have a twisted sense of humor, but I like how he picks on her. There were parts when I thought he was way too mean, but she has her ways of getting him back. Overall I think it wasreally funny, but had its sweet moments. For others who think the girl character Erika is annoying, well she kind of is, but I think it just works to get Kyoya to fall for her, because he is just so mean (in a good way, if there is a good way).\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't mind the guy being mean and the girl being a hopeless romantic and still willing to love him and just understanding that love shows itself in different forms then you will probably enjoy this anime.",

I have never used such brutal words to express anything. Lot of people worked on this anime, spent hours working on it, nights, sweat everything. I respect the effort. But the anime is sending out a very incorrect message. Girls need to be taught to respect themselves, not to tolerate domination.)\r\nI could not even read this manga. The guy, supposedly hottie, treats a commonplace girl, like a dog, quite literally.

From then on you can sort of guess how the whole thing will unfold. \\n\\n\r\nThere's definitely a Sub and Dom vibe to the odd relationship formed between Sata and Erika: he likes it that she follows him around like a lost puppy while displaying but loyalty and complete submission, while Erika... Frankly I have no idea why she's so determine to stay by Sata's side... Maybe because he's got a big d***... Meh, I don't know. Overall Sata is not such a bad guy; Erika takes it on herself to redeem him and prove to everyone he's putting on the tough act so that people keep their distance and don't bother him. \\n\\n\r\nBottom line is that the anime is funny, fast-paced, and light. It has its share of cringe worthy moments for sure, so girls beware: don't watch it and expect it to be some romantic relationship guide-line.",

But , for the first time , i just want to try new things and give this anime a try . I have to thanked him for suggested this to me and maybe gonna ask for his suggestion later . Anyway , back to the review .\r\nStory:8\r\nThe story plot is good from the start to the end . Not too good or too bad . But , its just oneof those anime that just make you want to know what does he or she gonna do next . (well for me of course)\\n\\n\r\nArt:9\\n\r\nThe arts are the usual one that have good animation and stuff . I don't know why but its almost have the same arts as Golden Time . (Or maybe its just me who thought about that)\\n\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\r\nFrom the voice actor , to the opening and ending theme song , all of it is good . I just love the ending theme song of this anime . Too bad i didn't know what the name of the song . Well , no worries because i can google it later not that you guys care of course -_-\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:9\\n\r\nAll of the characters from Erika to Kyoya and the rest of them are all perfect . Not too perfect . I just love seeing Erika who is the type of person who never give up . Sometimes she almost give up but then quickly get back up and start to fight again . Kyoya on the other hand , he is the type of person who is hard to show his feeling i mean from the first few episode , i thought to myself , what a guy . But then , he is just a normal person like any other except he doesnt know how to show his feeling or something like that . Nonetheless , its a total of 9 from me for sure .\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8\\n\r\nI won't lie that everytime Kyoya does something that piss me off , the enjoyment just poof away . But , thinking about it for a second time , every time he piss me off , its just make me want to know whats gonna happen next and little by little i know he has a feeling for Erika . In a nutshell , the first till the end of episode , i enjoy it just fine .\\n\\n\r\nOverall:9\\n\r\nAll i can say is that im actually feel envy for Erika personality that doesnt want to give up because she work so hard on trying to make Kyoya like her back but always fail in many ways  that i pity her and cry a bit . (seriously dont know why i cry though) I will always remember Erika face when she's happy and Kyoya who is trying so hard to say i love you but instead , say something like i like your do lol\\n",

The more I think about it the more it reminds me of others relationships in high school.   I always struggled to be in a relationship, probably because I was the nice guy.  Regardless, I could never treat someone like the boy in the anime does.  With that being said, I can only recommend this as a time killer as there are so many better romance anime's out there to watch than this one.  Ifyou're anything like me this anime will just piss you off until you get to the end, the first 7 episodes had so much poison I couldn't enjoy the rest..\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\r\nNothing new to see here, if your wanting to watch this for a story that pulls at your heart strings I suggest you look elsewhere.

The protagonist, Erika, also termed as 'wolf girl' is a clingy character, and probably might be one of the most optimistic in the show. If you don't like that element, honestly, stop watching this, because she just stays this way throughout the entirety of this anime.

            "content": "Shojou rom-com anime often fall into one of two camps.\r\nThere's the type where the girl is pursued by the guy, and those where the guy is pursued by the girl (and rare exceptions where both like each other or neither likes the other). Now, there's nothing wrong with either of these. As long as neither party is actually treating the other badly. With Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji, or in English, Wolf Girl and Black Prince, I can't say this is the case.\r\nThe establishing plot in episode 1 is that our protagonist, Erika Shinohara, is starting high school (because of course), but by the timeshe reaches her classroom, the only classmates left to make friends with seem to only talk about their boyfriends. Erika, being a compulsive liar or \"wolf girl\", makes up a boyfriend in an attempt to fit in. Eventually she takes a picture of a stranger on the street to use as evidence, and obviously it turns out to be a guy from the same grade, Kyoya Sata. She asks him to pretend to be her boyfriend, and he agrees on the condition that she will act as his dog.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much of a story, and the romantic subplots are very predictable. This wouldn't be a problem, there are many character-driven shows out there, but the problem here is that Erika and Kyoya are incredibly one-note and show little change, while also being unlikable at various instances.\\n\\n\r\nErika is just so desperate it's more than a little embarrassing, and is pretty much defined only by her love for Kyoya. As soon as she realises she loves him, pretty early on in the series, everything is about him. She doesn't show any personality outside of her loving Kyoya and wanting him to love her back. It was frustrating to see her keep running back to him after he hurt her repeatedly, clinging to him even when she had the option to leave. Maybe some may say I'm just not as forgiving, but in my opinion the problem is that her self-respect is non-existent and it's pretty hard to watch. \\n\\n\r\nKyoya, on the other hand, seems to care about Erika barely at all, even by the end. He strings her on, even when he knows exactly how she feels, and in fact does things on purpose that would make her upset. There is a scene in a coffee shop at one point that actually shocked me in its cruelty. They explained his coldness with a difficult family history, but that was no reason to act as insufferable as he did. There were moments he seemed to be getting better, like her birthday episode for example, only for him to go right back to how he was by the next episode. The anime skipped months ahead several times and the characters still appeared to be in the same places, which doesn't bode well.\\n\\n\r\nLet me repeat, there is nothing wrong with having an initially cold love interest, male or female, if they are executed correctly. One of the best examples I can think of is Tomoe from Kamisama Hajimemashita. In his case, his reasons to be distant were a lot more well-defined, he was never unnecessarily mean to the girl in love with him, and he had a distinct arc. Not to mention Nanami was a well-developed character with motivations outside of her love life. Ookami Shoujo has neither of these things, so I really can't say I recommend it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was eye-candy for girls which I can appreciate, and the \"heart-fluttering\" moments did make my heart flutter despite everything. The animation was pretty standard, though you can't expect much from most shoujo on that front. The voice actors worked well enough with the scripts that they had (Erika was pretty annoying but I think that's more on the script). The music in the anime was forgettable but I actively disliked the opening theme because of the singing style but that might just be me. The comedy was fine, nothing extraordinary, the jokes landed most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I did like about the anime were the side characters San, Takeru and Kusakabe, because they were actually very likeable. If they were the main characters of this anime, or were able to actually affect the main leads, I think I'd like this anime a lot more. Kyoya's sister and mother were also interesting despite being underdeveloped due to lack of screen-time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime was pretty average. If you want something to fill your time without too much thinking required, like I did when I picked it up, it's passable. Again, the heart fluttering moments do work and for many that's all they want out of shoujo. There are a lot better series in the genre though which deliver both those and good characters, and I'd recommend most of those before this.",

It was really interesting to watch something like that, and i have to say that i was thinking this will be boring, but in the end it was a really funny series and i quite enjoyed it.\r\nThe story had a nice amount of Romance in it, Comedy almost perfect and the \"slice of life\" part just like it should be.\r\nIt's also really interesting how the anime showsthe characters in the show, not only their good side, but also the bad side, the side that you don't show always, that side you actually want to use but can't, and you can see all that when you watch how the characters act. They made it really clear and everything they tell us about the characters is also something that is happening in the real life (more than you can imagine) and is something you will face often.\\n\r\nWhat i want to say is that this show also teaches you some stuff about life and that's what i love in Shoujo and Slice of Life anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI already said something about the characters in the section \"story\" so i'm only going to say that i loved them, and most of them are really interesting because they are really different, some are arrogant, some want to rule, some are just stupid, and and and. That difference between the characters makes the story even more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIf i look at the animation that is being made in the last few months i have to say that this Anime does have one of the best, even thou i'm a fan of the 90s anime style (they are better!), i have to praise this one - the main reason is probably the use of colors, almost perfect!\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOpening theme and ending theme are made to make your day, really happy and you can even dance while listening to them, i love that :D Opening theme was a little bit better than the Ending, but the ED was also really great, a bit slower, but i think that's better for endings, to be slower than the opening.\\n\r\nBackground music was good, but they could have used it a bit more, i missed it at some parts, that was something i really wanted to hear more often to make the atmosphere even better.\\n\\n\\n\r\nShort and clear: The anime is really good and i recommend it to anyone who likes Romance/Comedy, I'm sure you won't regret watching it. I finished the series in one day, even thou i don't really do that, it was just interesting!",

To begin with, that itself is already a turn-off in terms of the clich\u00e9 story line. The protagonist however felt  far more relateable and realistic than the bulk of the female protagonists we tend to see. The male lead allows us to feel a sense of deep hatred towards him which also made me turn away due to that no girl should fall for someone that cruel. But somehow, the plot allowed for us and the male lead to soften as we rodethe emotional rollercoaster.",

            "content": "I general dislike reviews which are biased against or towards something so I will try to be fair without putting anything on a pedestal or undermining it. Let me just say in advance: I actually like this anime but I'll be fair towards it so you can have a more clear view on what to expect.\r\nLet's start with the stuff that I didn't enjoy as much.\r\n The two main leads have a few problems. Kyoya for some episodes is quite   a jerk and made me -and the main heroine- quite upset. With his evil side showing -especially on the firsts episodes- and somereally mean things he can say he made me wonder how could Erica stay with him. (For his good Qualities see the next paragraph.) Erika on the other hand annoyed me a lot in the first episode. She's willing to lie to be part of the group and as a resutl gets herself in a mess. When it comes to characters however, I  personally really disliked her two new 'best friends', Aki and Marin. I found no redeeming qualities to them and\\n\r\n*mild spoiler?* I was suprised that Erika didn't ditch them.\\n\r\nHowever, they were the only characters that  I did not stand. Everyone else had some redeeming qualities. These two didn't do anything good throughtout the anime.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that however, let's dive into the GOOD STUFF!\\n\r\nAs much as I disliked Kyouya for being a jerk, he does have some cute moments that did make me squeal. The first redeeming one was at the end of the 2nd Episode. I won't give any spoilers, but if you intend to watch this anime, I 'd suggest you watch at least until Episode 2 to make a decision. I believe it foreshadows well his character and the anime itself. Kyouya though, does become better as the series progresses, as he has some baggage he needs to deal with. Any fans of the Shoujo Genre will know this type of Character Arc, especially if the character has many bad characteristics in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nLet's show some love to Erika as well. As much as I disliked her in the first Episode, I had a bit of sympathy towards her. I won't say 'all' as I hate generalisations, but most people want to fit in and I can identify with her situation. She becomes better though! I must say that! By the end of the series she's more complete and I had more respect for her.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters (apart from Marin and Aki) are very likeable and interesting. I especially adored Kyouya's friend, Takeru. He is so charming I just want to hug him...\\n\\n\r\nAnyway...\\n\\n\r\nThe animations is good and the Sound is alright. It didn't sweep me away with an unforgatable opening, but it was visually interesting and the song was pleasing.\\n\\n\r\nThere were uncomfortable moments between the two leads, I will admit that, but I believe they balance out as both leads try to resolve them by the end of each episode. That though ,made the anime more real to me. There are no 'perfect' guys and girls in the real world. We are all people that have our problems, baggage and quirks and I respect the anime for not being that 'fairy tale' kind of story. I also admire it for one of the morals  it showed. That you can't really change a person and you shouldn't expect them to. You should be true to yourself and love them for who they are. That's how I saw it at least.\\n\\n\r\n The Anime had an impact on me. I'll admit, I'm generally an emotional person, so romance really gets me. I generally like watching at least one Episode of an anime before diceding how I feel about it. I generally don't trust the opinions of others as they tend to be biased. I say that and yet I write a review. I tried to be as impartial as I could be and hopefully that gave you a good image of what to expect.",

            "content": "Before you raise a brow at my seemingly contradicting ratings, take time to read my review. \r\nThe story line is nothing unique, memorable, or worth remembering. It focuses on the development of a relationship between a hostile teen boy and a submissive girl. That's not what makes the story line mediocre; it's how the  story developed. To avoid ruining the frustration the audience will encounter while watching the two main characters interact, I'm simply going to describe my disappointment with a failure in progression throughout the film. When presented with two characters that have different outlooks on life in a romance anime that issupposed to center around character development, I expect some type of progression throughout the story. That's not what happened here. The story replays bitter and tasteless cliches; the concept was only ended with even more submission from the teen girl. At no point in time was there any in-depth revelation, reason, or psychological explanation for why this teen boy treated the submissive girl the way he did. The fact that she does nothing but give in or allow such treatment from him doesn't help cure our suspicions either. The story line is repetitive and predictable and all in the worse ways. You'd have to be a mindless fangirl to avoid noting such a disappointing story line. However, despite this cliched nonsense, it did flow nicely--just in an annoying manner. It's a boring simple cliche of romance with no development or in-depth meaning. The pacing was good and the episodes fit together nicely, but the concept of this story line and its failure of progression really did do a number on it. All said and done, the ending was cute.  \\n\\n\r\nI'd consider the main male lead a bishounen. The female characters weren't anything impressive and none of the characters had astonishing detail. They were all fairly attractive and well distinguishable; the environment around them was also neatly animated. There was nothing memorable or enchanting about the animation. It did not affect the overall quality of the anime in any sense. I did find a few of the characters to be attractive.\\n\\n\r\nNone of the soundtracks were notable or worthy of remembering: I barely remember the intro and outro for this anime. I didn't enjoy them much either. I've only watched the Japanese version. The Japanese voice actors did a very good job of matching the voices with the characters personalities. There were times when I could feel the power in the words being conveyed and it helped me understand the emotions of characters better due to this. This helps enhance the show and cover up an inch of the badly developed concept. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development was horrendous. I do not exaggerate in the slightest when I say such things. I'm going to make a quick comparison between the lead female role in Lovely Complex and the female lead role here. They both have consistent and constant personalities with mild outbursts here and there when they got emotional. However, the female lead in this anime fails to express herself and there is almost no depth to her personality as an independent individual. Most of her personality is substituted by her following around the male lead all the time allowing him to do whatever he wants to her so she could be accepted or loved. Besides one time in the anime, she never confronts him or thoughtfully ponders on her interactions involving him. There is absolutely no depth. She simply follows him around like a puppy, allows whatever to happen to herself, and when she's not with him she's thinking of how to please him. This is not the course of thought or action a typical human would have being treated in such a way, and since this isn't supposed to be a story about a mindless teen girl psychologically abused by her boyfriend, I'm quite disappointed. The only story within this girl relies on the male lead. He himself is also typical. He's sadistic, cruel, and has a gentle side to him, but once again, this does not progress. Yes, he had his few moments where he played Mr. nice guy to the female lead throughout the story, but it wasn't done in a warming way. It's in a way that the typical fangrl would get all excited about and rate the anime a 10 simply for one half-assed sweet moment. His expressions towards her were poorly done and there is never a real explanation for the reason his personality developed the way it did. It's simply just a constant cycle of abuse and conflict with a touch of love. Neither characters grew and the supporting characters were awfully obviously there to support. There was no depth to them either. I've already almost forgotten about all the characters in the show. I liked the simple characteristics of each character, but since they failed to grow, I was highly disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the reason for the rating of my enjoyment? Well, I don't mind cliche animes. I myself \"fangirl\" and get excited over small scenes that makeup for the terrible story line and character development, but I do take time to think about all aspects of the anime after watching before making a fair judgement. I'm a sucker for romances--even mediocre ones--and this anime was not terrible. It was terribly mediocre with terribly developed aspects. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you like cliche animes and can bat an eye in the presence of badly developed story lines and character development, you may enjoy it when you've run out of romance animes. It's a cheerful anime and moves in a gleeful direction, but I'd be lying if I said it was anything other than mediocre. I'd recommend it to romance suckers that are easily entertained. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The characters themselves are very cookie-cutter. I mean, the basic template for a romance is enemies-to-friends, right? So, basically, you're gonna get a way-to-gullible-and-earnest girl met with a \"I-don't-need-friends-they-disappoint-me\" guy. That may be reason enough for you to dislike this anime, but personally, the idea of these characters coming together in the way that they did was very interesting. Cold characters or naive characters are very common in romance anime, but I think the personalitiesof these characters made up the difference and made it really nice to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is also extremely cliche and overdone. For one, it moved way too fast. The story was reserved for romance development and nothing else, so out of the whole ensemble of characters, only one got serious development. However, for whatever reason, the way the story progressed didn't bother me all that much. I would've preferred for the moments and story points to be stretched out so that the ultimate ending would've been more satisfying, but all in all, it felt like they paced it well enough for how quickly everything happened. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know, just make good decisions, alright? If you think you'll like it, you probably will. If you're looking for a spectacular love story, you probably won't. It isn't meant to be another Host Club or Ao Haru Ride. It's just fun and a little bit touching. So, use your judgment and watch it if you want. The characters are cool, and the story isn't the cringiest thing ever. So, yeah. Do with that what you will.",

I don't like it when the female character is constantly being shut down by the male character because he's stubborn, and that is EXACTLY what was portrayed throughout this show.\u00a0In fact, that is exactly what this show is about. \r\nAt first I didn't like this anime because of how mercilessly cruel Kyouya was to Erika, but unlike Itazura na Kiss, Kyouya's character developed quite nicely. When he and Erika started dating, it was clear to see that he wasslowly becoming nicer to her - though he was still mean to her - and it made me warm up to the show.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I don't know how Erika stayed with Kyouya so long before they became a real couple.

Granted Erika could walk away from him at any time but because of certain circumstances she doesn't (She did this to herself). \r\nNow for me, I overall did enjoy this anime. It started out rocky but as you keep watching you see Kyouya and Erika slowly grow and mature. Kyouya became a likable character by the 2nd half of the anime and you begin to see the reason he is a jerk and howhe begins to change.\\n\\n\r\n So I will be going on and reading the manga which is why I gave it an 8. The anime does a good job of keeping you entertained although sometimes you want to pull out your hair because of the stuff Ericka or Kyouya do!!! But its\\n\\n\r\nArt + style wise its really good and enjoyable. \\n",

            "content": "To be honest, I didn't want to write a rant about this, but I then thought that I had to say a couple of things about this anime. (Excuse if there are any mistakes, English is not my first language).\r\nAt first, we can see a cute girl who makes a strange deal with some hot guy, and then they start a fake relationship... Yay! Now the girl is happy because she thinks that with that, she can fit in some group of classmates who also have boyfriends. (How fucked up is that?) Anyway, everyone's been scared of not fitting in, and even though she doesa ridiculous thing, maybe we can just ignore this and continue to watch the series.\\n\\n\r\nBut, the thing is that this boy is nothing but a bully. He takes advantage of the situation (because she let him do that, okay, fine, let's continue) and does nothing but humilliate her over and over again, and well, this girl falls in love with him even though he is steping all over her (Seriously, she needs to love herself a little more). \\n\r\nI'm sorry, but I can't see a healthy relationship coming of this.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, the only reason I kept watching this anime was because I had high hopes for her. I wanted her to become a strong woman and to be able to ditch him or make things clear to him, to not be teased, and above all things, be respected.\\n\\n\r\nWell, we can see a little development in the guy's attitude, and he's not THAT bad anymore (even though he's still a over-protective boyfriend, and has a serious jealousy problem. Ah, and he's a little bit selfish too.)\\n\\n\r\nWell, in conclusion, I don't understand why is it that this anime has such a high rate, well, of course it may be addictive and you can see one episode after another, but when you stop and analyze it a little bit, you can see that the relationship is unhealthy, and the girl is a little bit dumb and the guy is an abusive prick.\\n\\n\r\nPD. Sure enough, the art is good, and the characters' designs are beautiful.",

I mean, i get that kyoya's character acts proudly and often ends up saying and doing the contrary of what he intends because of that, but sometimes he pushes it too far and treats the female lead horribly. And instead of making her react against it and make him realise how far he has taken it, she instead clings to him desperately and he never changes his attitude. This isn't just an unfair and morbid relationship, but also very tiring just to imagine havingto read behind your partners actions all the time and having to be careful of what you say or do.\\n\\n\r\nI have to say, even though i dont personally like the characterisation and the way the relationships are connected, i do believe they are well done in a sense. I mean, the way the characters react to one another makes sense and i like how not everything in their attitude seems to be justified (especially in kyoya's character) for i do believe that not everything in the way we act has to be strictly related to some trauma or experience in our past. \\n\\n\r\nStill, i dont think the series portrays Any good example for any relationship at all. The animation was pretty and the music quite fitting, but i dont have much positive things to say than that. It is kind of enjoyable i guess, if you are into the dominant male stuff.

I have mixed feelings, I guess? There were some parts I thought were funny but there were some moments that made me a bit uncomfortable.\r\nWhen people say this anime romanticizes abuse, that's probably true. However I feel the abuse mainly occurred when Kyouya and Erika were in a FAKE relationship. After they started dating for real, Kyouya was still an asshole but not as much as he was before. Whenthey date for real, Kyouya doesn't want to participate in any of the things that Erika wants to do and he calls her names, but I wouldn't necessarily call that \"abusive\", he's just a very annoying tsundere boy, but that doesn't excuse his actions in the past.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the art style, the characters looked pretty in my opinion. The sound was okay, not amazing to the ears though. I think Erika is a pretty relatable character and she's cute. Don't be fooled by Kyouya's good looks though, he's an attractive tsundere asshole.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime was pretty alright. Some characters were cute and the story was interesting. I just wish it was written better and the S&M was more healthy, that's all for this lame review of mine. Peace.",

It's about how they fell in love and how they both overcome insecurities and emotional walls.  \r\nThe Art is really great and feels larger than life in certain ways.  The character expressions are really fun to look at, there's no difficulty at all telling characters apart, and they don't re-use animation sequences at all.  \r\nThe Sound was pretty good.  Everything seemed tofit and the music wasn't painful to listen to either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are really great.  Each has their own quirks but you can fall in love with most of them pretty quickly.

            "content": "At the beginning, I thought it was very cringeworthy and actually painful to watch due to all the vapid normalcy and overdramatic/exaggerated mannerisms of the characters: we have a ridiculously shallow, pathological liar for a leading lady and a shinning-but-actually-dark prince archetype, who, because of these exact so-called personalities, were put together by insubstantial circumstances.  I say \"insubstantial\" because, even if these features are actually in the title, they're not even consistent in these characterizations. Throughout the series, their \"labels\" or defining traits only come out when it's convenient or when something needs to be done for the plot, and not because of thecharacters' actual \"personalities.\" What's more is that they end up in an abusive relationship, where I could swear that the \"girlfriend\" developed symptoms of battered wife syndrome. \\n\\n\r\nAs the story unfolded, and one stereotypical twist after another, I eventually mellowed down and grew to appreciate the character growth that took place. I cannot emphasize how cliche and how dangerous the reinforcement of ignorance on actual relationships the \"my love is going to change him\"-without basis nor reason, I might add- idea is, but I decided to watch with the lens of \"I guess that how life goes sometimes,\" and took a step back to enjoy the rest of the series. \\n\\n\r\nI still feel that the great transition in their relationship was abrupt, and perhaps the emerging feelings of romance for each other could have been milked more, but again, the characters do actually develop (though without any real prompt), and it was nice to see the change that they went through because of their so-called love. I especially appreciated the respect each had learned for how the other expressed affection, and the sacrifices made on pride or ideals of intimacy for the sake of the partner.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime wasn't necessarily good per se, but watching it for the sake of entertainment and not being too critical can make it somewhat enjoyable due to the silliness of it all.",

Some prince like guy who's acting like an angel, who is so kind and handsome and always smiling in front of everyone. And then, turns out to be so damn evil. Though I really love Kyouya Sata. He's so twisted and he says rude things, and he is cold but in the end, he has a heart that cares. I love the character development of this one. The way the protagonists handled the difficulty in their relationship, in their family, in their future.How every characters decide on the road they'll take. Not because of the people around them but because they want to. I love an anime, well, romance anime, which starts on knowing each other and ending having a happily lifetime being in a family. I don't know if it is just me or what. I know this is a common story which you can possibly saw in a movie or in a book or whatever it is. But there's so many lessons in here about handling relationships, for me. You know, it's probably my speculations but most of the girls want someone like Kyouya in their life. Nah. He's not perfect. He has flaws. But either way, he is also good. To be true. Hahaha. Kidding. I highly suggest to read it in manga after you've finish the anime series. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonists, I really love his role. I don't know if he can be what we called tsundere. But I think it is more than that. He rudely says the opinion he have. But for me, he's being honest that way. The part of the girl is sooo simple?  Not to be arrogant or what. For me, the role of the girl is what a real human role is now in our world. Immature, Jealous, Full of Doubt? Overall, most of the characters in this is human, for me. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song is cute. It is lively. Honestly, the song is already on my playlist. I guess, there's nothing wrong with the voices of the characters. There's no lapses I can think of in this category. Sorry.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, yeah. I've really enjoyed it. \\n\r\nI think it is a natural reaction for a girl. Maybe the sick episode/part is the one I really don't like the most. Coz hey, that's really a common scene in a romance anime. Someone gets sick and some is taking care of it. Apart from that, I do enjoy all of the episodes and chapters of the anime and the manga. \\n\\n\r\nENDING: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI love the ending, really.  The part where they live as a happy family. That the protagonist realize that he is already happy. For me, that is one of the best ending we can get in an anime/manga. Since there will be no additional questions as what if they didn't end up together? What if there will be another guy or gal who'll destroy them. Soemthing like that. So ending up with the marriage and family thing is really good for me.",

            "content": "I never write reviews but this time, I couldn't help it. I was interested in watching it because, as other people said, it's often listed in ''top best romance animes'', so I was curious. Now, I've seen a lot of animes, and read a lot of manga where the main interest is cold, sometimes borderline mean, but this was completely different. We're not talking about a typical case of ''guy is actually very sensitive/has a dark past and doesn't know how to express himself''. The main romantic interest is CRUEL. I had to stop watching several times midway through an episode because I just couldnot believe how cruel and abusive he was towards the MC and it made me too upset. How can anyone consider this as a romantic tv show? Or actually envy the MC for being in this position? Because the guy is 'hot'? Because, sometimes, he shows interest?\\n\\n\r\nNow, speaking of the MC. I couldn't help but feel bad for her, and also find her extremely pathetic. She appears to be this strong character who, despite everything, will always fight for her love and will never stop trying to win the guy over. She just doesn't know how to let go, even though she's treated very poorly and cruelly, because somewhere deep down, she HOPES he will change when he finally has feelings for her. She HOPES she will become special enough that he will treat her the way she would like to be treated.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry but to me, all I see are redflags for an abusive relationship. I do not understand how this could possibly be seen as romance and it's becoming more and more common to see animes with a female MC who's head over heels for a guy who treats her so poorly and sees no possibility of falling in love with the sometimes second romantic interest, who actually cares for her. She'll always go back to the one who breaks her heart and makes her feel sad more than happy. Women don't deserve that, this is not love, this is not respect, and this show is not an example to follow. I hated it from the beginning to the end.",

            "content": "I shall admit to only watching this because I am on a Sakurai Takahiro binge; otherwise this wouldn't have attracted me because I wasn't really in a shoujo mood (I rarely am in a shoujo mood).\r\nBut it actually turned out more enjoyable than expected, despite the fairly ridiculous premise, and the inherently distasteful idea of some guy making a girl his \"dog\" and trampling all over her feelings with impunity.  But hey it's anime, and ridiculous behaviour is pretty much the norm.\r\nStory (5/10):  Erika wants to desperately fit in with people in her new high school class, make friends, and create those specialyouthful memories, but by the time she gets her courage up, most people have grouped up already, and she is stuck with two girls who're pretentious as all get-out and talk about nothing but their elite boyfriends.  And so Erika lies through her teeth about HER boyfriend.  She really would like to have one, she wants to experience romance, and she has very specific ideas what that means -- very stereotypical ideas.  It's all about appearances with Erika.\\n\\n\r\nWhen her new \"friends\" become suspicious because she doesn't even have a picture of her boyfriend, in momentary panic she takes a picture of a real hottie on the street, whom she then passes off as her boyfriend.  Unfortunately for her, that person turns out Sata Kyouya, who goes to the same school, and one of her hoity-toity friends recognizes him. Kyouya is known as a \"prince\" for his good looks and his amiable if distant personality; all the girls squee over him.\\n\\n\r\nErika freaks out, afraid she will be found out as the liar that she is and ridiculed and outcast -- pretty much the worst thing that could happen to her.  But because Kyouya has such a sterling reputation, she decides to talk to him, fesses up, and begs him to pretend to be her boyfriend. He smiles at her and agrees.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the last moment of peace Erika will have for a while.  Because she isn't the only liar -- underneath his princely public behaviour Kyouya is a bitter loner who despises everything Erika wishes for.  And he has a condition for pretending to be her boyfriend: she has to become his \"dog\", do everything he demands when he demands it.  You'd kind of expect a little demonic behaviour from a character with red eyes, right?\\n\\n\r\nI am not as offended as other people by the dog thing, and by his treatment of Erika. It provides a wakeup call for her in every which way -- not everything that glitters is gold, the cost of a big lie might not be worth it, it's exhausting to keep up appearances.  Kouya is quite mean to her, even though he also drops a lot of comments that make her think, and he is unexpectedly nice when other people mess with her.\\n\\n\r\nSo of course she falls in love.  She is still much more in love with the idea of a boyfriend than she is with Kouya, and it's pretty clear he knows that even if she doesn't.  What develops is not uninteresting; I like how Erika and Kyouya manage to cobble an actual relationship together while coming from such divergent viewpoints.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7 of 10): It's quite pretty; the characters are easy to tell apart, the very-very-shoujo backgrounds are lovely if you like that sort of thing, and the animation is decent.  Erika has a very expressive face, and Kyouya is hot.\\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10):  The OP has an interesting singer, the ED left me cold, the BGM is sort of just there.  AS reviously mentioned, I am a Sakurai Takahiro fanboy; the man can do no wrong.  Itou Kanae does a good job with Erika, Kayano Ai gives a very appropriately laconic performance for Erika's real friend Sanda Ayumi, the rest of the cast is decent but nobody stands out for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10):  I like Kyouya a lot.  Sorry, haters -- I fully understand why you hate him, and I agree he acts like a jerk, but frankly, the jerk behaviour only really bothers me when he hurts Erika in regard to her love for him.  That is cruel.  The rest is... he is actually helping her, though he is not a nice task master.  Why did he even agree to the pretense?  He didn't have to; he could have let her hang out to dry; her being his \"dog\" isn't actually benefiting him a whole lot.  He despises what she tries to do and still he helps her.  And he is a jerk while doing it because he is as flawed as she is.  He lies to himself about not having abandonment issues, and he has a negative view of romance because he has seen it fail spectacularly, and destroy his family. He's pretty much a tsundere because his kindness is at odds with the hard armour he has built around himself to not end up like his parents.\\n\\n\r\nNo, there is no Stockholm Syndrome here; Erika can quit this game at any time; he has no real power over her at all -- and she does indeed do that eventually, when he goes too far.  Good on her.  I also appreciate that there is no sexual misconduct here, no sexual pressure -- the tasks he sets her as his \"dog\" are not demeaning in that sense.  I found that a welcome relief from the constant sexual harassment so prevalent in anime.\\n\\n\r\nI like Erika too, even though I feel about her aspirations much the same as Kyouya does.  But aside from the lying and the yearning for a romance that would ultimately be empty, she's a good kid, even a little naive (how could anyone not see through Kamiya?).  She has empathy, and I can see her grow up to be a much less superficial person than she starts out as.\\n\\n\r\nI like Sanda, Hibiya, and Kusakabe.  They're just prop characters, and in a longer anime I would have liked to see more of them. In general I felt the anime was too short; I would have liked there to have been more time for things to develop; this could have been a much more solid story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10): I quite enjoyed it.  It'll never be among my favourite anime, but I thought it was above average in depth, and it was sufficiently different for me to not be bored; though it became more typical in the last third.",

I should have kept it dropped.\r\nI recently came back across it and all I have to say for it is 'let down'. the idea behind it is cute! and I liked the idea behind it, but the execution is... horrible.\r\nI got to episode 5, near the end, before I went 'stuff this, this is emotional abuse, I can't watch this' because that's what this is- it is emotional abuse. plain and simple.\r\nanother review compares it to Stockholm Syndrome and that's prettyaccurate- but in it's simplest form this is just as I said before, emotional abuse and not something Erika should stand for.\\n\\n\r\nI generally like this kind of anime, even anime's that overplay a character type (looking at you Dame x Prince), but this is just extreme in a way that makes me really, really, angry.\\n\\n\r\nErika *should* be likeable, her character is something many people should be able to relate too- lying in school to make friends/keeping up a lie to make friends. (though I use friends loosely, her only real friend here is miss short hair). But she just... isn't, because no one, insane or not, would deal with this kind of stuff! not even Harley Quinn dealt with all the crap she got from the Joker in the end but the way I see this anime going Erika would be dealing with Sota for the rest of her life... happily. and that's just wrong in so many ways.\\n\\n\r\nthen we have Sota... oh boy do I have words for this character- when I first saw him I went 'okay, he's kinda a dick but that means character development, right?'. but 5 episodes out of 12 there's not even a HINT of improvement in this boy. there's no exception to his attitude for Erika, there's no hint that he cares about her more than that of a slave. in fact by all rights everyone BUT Erika is the exception to his personality (even his friend gets better treatment than her?? like??? what????)\\n\\n\r\nfake girlfriend or not. that is NOT how you treat a person without laying down rules and a signed fucking contract. and even then you don't treat them like that 24/7. just no. no matter what happened to you in your pasted (hinted during the fever episode) you go to THERAPY not take it out on a person. jesus, Merlin and any other demi-god I can think of. it's not hard.\\n\\n\r\nthe animation is cute, the voice acting is spot on, but dear god if you have ever had a crappy romance, or don't take even watching abuse well (like me), or have been abused before, or you're looking for an anime to base any kind of romance off (real or fictional) DO.NOT.WATCH.THIS.ANIME.\\n\\n\r\nI repeat DO.NOT.WATCH.THIS.ANIME.\\n\\n\r\nI am 80% tempted to write a fix-it fic where I self-insert myself just to slap these characters around a bit. wake up call for all of them. seriously. wtf. but to do that I'd have to finish the anime so eh.... maybe if I get SUPER bored :/ and can withdraw all my emotions for 4 hours.",

            "content": "I have never reviewed anything, but since nobody I know cares about anime, I needed some sort of platform to express how I felt after this anime. Please be aware my review will contain minor story spoilers.\r\nThe only thing I can relate to in this anime, was heroine's name - Erika! It was amazing to watch an anime with my first name spoken so often and cute, Erika Chan! It got me very excited from the very beginning, decent humour, nicely drawn animation, hot but cold main male lead, what else could I ask for? Got me rolling.\r\nHowever I soon started wishing I would endthis thing soon. Erika... Where do I even start. She annoyed the soul out of me. I was actually wishing she would fail in any attempt or mission. No backbone, no dignity whatsoever. I am not a feminist, or anything close but the way she represents young women, is unbelievably bad. Allows to be treated like dirt (girls like ''Bad'' guys, huh?), forces herself onto someone, to the point where I felt embarrassed for her. I started loving the anime around the mid way through where she actually nicely told Kyouya to hit the road. I was like ''You go girl!'' and was really enjoying Erika learning to be an independent woman,  him being jealous / losing control over her. And then by the end of the episode, after being all strong and resistant, Erika decides to possibly force herself on him FOR YEARS until he gives in?! No matter what horrible things he would say to her, she would ignore it all by, let's say, receiving a bloody necklace and forgetting all about the embarrassament she gone through! That just killed the last respect I had for her and I realised how shallow and stupid her character is. From that point I really wished she would fail or Kyouya would just dump her (a lot to expect from shoujo anime, I know.)\\n\\n\r\nIn a funny way, I liked Kyouya. He is a proper jerk, but considering how stupid and annoying Erika is, why not take an advantage? I liked his sole, loner, grumpy person attitude, because I can mostly relate to that, I still did not like the way he treats and views women though. Being mad at your mum for walking out is not an excuse to treat women like pets. I also did not actually believe he liked / loved Erika all that much. It seemed forced to please the audience of course. I think a guy like him would not bother saying one word to a silly goose of a girl like Erika.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, I did enjoy it. A bit plain at the times (dialogues with colorful border around the character, no movement apart from lips, scenes) I enjoyed the humour! Found myself trying not to laugh out loud few times. Some scenes were actually really funny, voice acting included.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I was excited around episodes 1-2, Started disliking it around 3-5 where she actually falls for him, LOVED the episode where she quit the wolf girl attitude and mostly hated it with passion afterwards till the end. Around episode 9-11 I was thinking maybe to just drop it here, but I finished it. My overall rating is 5. There was some enjoyment to it, some ''Butterflies in the stomach'' moments as I call it, but characters annoyed me so much, I could barely watch it through.",

            "content": "OVERALL: 8 \r\nShinohara Erika is an up coming first year at her new high school and wants to be able to \"fit in\" or make new friends. In order to accomplish this, she creates lies and the main one being about her having a boyfriend. When her new friends ask her what her new boyfriend looks like, she panics since the past two months she has been using her friend Sanda Ayumi as her \"boyfriend,\" She then decides to take a picture of any guy she finds after school and shows it to her friends. It turns out the guy she took a photo ofis the \"prince\" of the school, Seta Kyouya! In order to get him to become her pretend boyfriend, Erika must obey him and become Kyouya's dog.\\n\\n\r\n***No Spoilers (hopefully)*** \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nI would say the story is a lot like many shoujo manga with a tsundere, but popular guy and a naive girl who wants to fit into school. I throughly enjoyed the plot line of the show with Erika's attempts of trying to fit in by lying. This ends up with her pretending to be in a relationship with a popular guy at school. The  twist is that Kyouya isn't like most main character guys, his kindness at school is just facade while Erika knows his true self as a \"sadist.\" Overall, the show is more comedic and cheesy as well as there being some sweet moments such as Kyouya showing his feelings and Erika's attempts at having a \"normal\" relationship. Seeing as the story progresses, their relationship blooms as well and becomes really cute in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art is throughly well done I would say, it is a different style from the manga, but I like it. Kyouya is definitely good looking with his tall figure and nice face, while Erika has \"the typical normal girl\" type look. Most of the characters don't look too flashy (maybe Kamiya... and Erika's new friends) and the backgrounds look pretty mundane since they do live in Tokyo. The art appealed to me a lot with the character designs, the wolf ears that pop up when Erika lies, the chibis, and especially the funny expressions like Kyouya's sadist look that gets me laughing every time. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe music I think was to my taste, the opening was pretty catching and I did like the ending a lot. The funny thing was a lot of people keep wanting to listen to the ending because of the beep. Also, the background music for most of the anime was like usual shoujo which I liked and enjoyed since most of the time it matched the scenes and made some really funny. (Especially in episode 9 XD). The voices were amazing I would say, especially Kyouya (because his VA is Sakurai-sensei <3) with his soothing voice that matched his handsome looks (I've already fallen for Kyouya noo T.T). Also, I liked Takeru (his VA is Hosya Yoshimasa aka Sousukeee) with his loud voice that matched his loud personality XD.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nI loved all the characters and their personalities! Erika is a very kindhearted girl that really has no bad intentions with her lying, she tries her best to fit in, appease Kyouya and is funny when she ask Kyouya for things. Kyouya is very tsudere I would say, he doesn't express his feelings much, slightly sadist when it comes to Erika and a bit of a tease I would say. He has a reason for being like this, but I feel like that just is his personality too. I love his sadist self and his occasional sweetness towards Erika and how he acts around Kamiya and Takeru is hilarious. You get to know the characters more and more through each episode and for those who enjoy the show would come to understand each one (except like maybe, probably Erika's new friends-). My favorites have got to go to Kyouya, Takeru and Kusakabe who are played by VAs that I love a lot too. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this shoujo anime a lot since nowadays I rarely do with all the shounen with some having dark themes, fighting, and more that I do still enjoy. It was very refreshing watching something so cheesy and sweet with more ikemen characters. Kyouya is very appealing with his actual personality that I enjoyed (does that make me an M? lol). Overally, it's a good anime to watch if you can get past the cliche characters and story, but are looking to watch a very funny and sweet anime.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review helps others! I just loved this anime a lot and have fallen for yet another ikemen guy as well as watching another role that Sakurai-sensei is in. Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji is now one of my favorite shoujo animes out there now. <3 \\n\\n",

Basically I did not expect myself to love it at all.\r\nStory: 9\r\nI've always been a fan of like the bad boy and good girl falling for each other. What I like about this anime is if many of the characters have something to say, it doesn't take long for them to express it. This story is great and I don't want to say anything else without spoiling it.\r\nArt: 9\r\nThe art is actually prettygreat and flowed really well, if that makes sense. There some scenes to do with a sort of moving 3D, which looked very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe music is fantastic! The opening is a favourite now, its catchy and stuck in my head. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nI very much enjoyed the characters in this show. I adored Kyouya, he could be menacing, but at times i his own way, he could be kind. Basically his characters had quite a bit of development after a little while of meeting Erika. I think Erika was a bit of a cliche character, but what I like about her that if she's got something to say. It doesn't take her long to say.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI've only ever given a 10 out 10 enjoyment to a couple of these slice of life/romantance kind of stuff, but I really did enjoy did this anime thick and through. I stay up till past 12 to finish it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nIf your looking for a great slice of life/romance/drama and all that sort of stuff, then I highly recommend this anime. It for sure has become one of my favourites.\\n",

Whether it's his personality or not, sometimes it goes too far and just unnecessary. But also when regarding the female lead, she just does my head in. She only really cares about popularity and what people think of her, which put me off her at the beginning. But then she develops into this girl who just yearns for a man who treats her like a dog, which I know is the 'comedy' aspect, but to me it wasn't funny towatch her chase after him when he's a douche and listen to his every demand. Even when she was presented a better offer, she still went back to him, eventhough all he had todo was show up, no apology needed apparently.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend it, but once again, if you like a dominant male and submissive female with practically no backbone; go crazy.",

            "content": "hello,\r\nWhat to say about Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji?!\r\nI was a bit disappointed I have to say.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nIt's very basic one. The girl wants to make friends, so she lies about pretty much everything in her life, and this includes the \"boyfriend\" that she does not have. Things progress and the boy she was claiming to be going out with is a student in her school. When she explains the situation he is ready to help, but not for good reasons. He wants to have fun and he's way of doing so is to treat our \"hero\" like a dog.\r\nIt sometimes borders on the indecency,and I kept asking myself why would someone do this just to fit in somewhere.\\n\r\nIt has some comic parts and as the story goes there is some developments so it does get better.\\n\r\nIt's easy to watch, and most people can enjoy it I guess. I did, it's not a masterpiece but I've seen worst.\\n\\n\r\nArt:7/10\\n\r\nThe art is good, the colors fit well with story and with the Shoujo theme. The character design is also good. The leading male has the cool style usually used in this type of anime and the leading girl the same.\\n\r\nIt's one of the best points.\\n\\n\r\nSound:6/10\\n\r\nLike most about this anime, the sound is neither good or bad. The opening and ending are catchy and funny, but nothing too special.\\n\r\nThe music during the episodes the same. There is no real use there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nYeah this is the hard part. In the beginning of the story the characters have both such a bad character that it leaves you wondering a bit about the whole concept for the series. But don't worry they do somehow evolve in a good way. Erika is a compulsive liar and Kyouya a sadist that only wanted a dog. Somehow she likes his personality and makes her life goal to go from \"the dog\" to proper girlfriend. In the end they do understand each other. Erika becomes a lot stronger and determined and Kyouya becomes kinder and understanding.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nPersonally it was hard for me to see the beginning. It felt like their relationship wasn't going anywhere. But has it progressed I did like and I still recommend it, if you have nothing better to watch it is fairly good.\\n\\n\r\nI think most people will like it. It's easy going, funny and at times adorable.\\n\\n\r\nThanks :D",

            "content": "TL;DR I personally enjoyed it. It has it flaws but I found it humerous, nice art, and interesting characters.\r\nStory: Erika wants to fit in at her new school and not be an outcast. To fit in, she'll do whatever it takes even if she has to lie through her teeth, just so she isn't alone. To spread her lie further she finds herself a fake boyfriend, who in return wants her to act like a dog. (This kinda put me off at that point.) In a way I wish the anime focused a bit more on her not wanting to be alone and why itwas a big deal say based on past experiences, but I guess that may get to deep and this is more of a comedic anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Not my personal all time favourite style but it was appealing to look at and no major wonky animations or anything.\\n\\n\r\nSound: They were decent. I'd usually end up skipping opening and ending though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I liked Erika but at times she was a bit too desperate because she doesn't know entirely what love is. It felt like she ended up liking the main guy too fast. There wasn't too much redeeming about it. But she was amusing as a character and was a bit tougher than most heroines in this style of anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe main guy is a total tsundere, too much actually. I don't see many male characters get this trope than female characters so it was interesting in that aspect. But seriously, he is so much of a jerk you cheer on Erika for thinking of a different guy. It takes too long for him to be a nicer character and would have liked to see more of the whole why he loves dogs so much. They actually don't focus on it too much.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It was pretty amusing even though some things were weird. So for just watching an anime for its comedy, I'd say it works there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It has bad aspects and good aspects but it isn't a bad anime. Maybe because I watched some really bad anime before watching this one, it may be seen better than it is but I still liked it nonetheless.",

            "content": "Let me say - this anime isn't as bad or cut throat as some point it out to be. It's a shoujo, yeah but if you know that then don't expect it to be something different. I seen a lot of reviews saying Kyouya treats Erika like a dog the whole time and he's nothing but an a**hole. But I beg to differ. As the synopsis suggests - Erika is overbearing and looking for friends so she lies to fit in with two girls in class about having a boyfriend. She then asks Kyouya to be her pretend boyfriend and in return he treats herlike a pet dog (for the most part).\\n\\n\r\nNow, this is a comedy and let me tell you the comedy is there for what it's worth. The 'Pet dog' title is the comedy. The characters are all pretty standard - two annoying girls, quiet and fun best friend, hot male lead, dorky but appealing female lead, perfect male opponents, quirky and supportive side characters. There is drama, boy saves girl, girl falls for guy, guys in denial (so... Basically your typical shoujo anime) and there is bitter sweet satisfaction too. For someone who has seen her fair share in shoujo's, I didn't mind this anime. It's refreshing and nice to look at *cough cough* I mean it's an appealing story. I wouldn't bat this down as much as people do - give it a go it's actually pretty good.",

            "content": "Having read the manga first, nothing about this anime really surprised me, nor should it for that matter. The art is good, music is fine, voice actors are good.\r\nSome of the main story was changed, most notably the exposition, and the ending where Erika and Seta went to Kobe, but this was probably done to fit the 12-episode format. They also skipped a pivotal moment in the fake relationship, where the two of them went to the beach with Marin and her boyfriend. But the plot moves along regardless, so it\u2019s not really a big deal.\r\nAs for the main characters. \r\nErika starts out as asomewhat independent person. Yes, she lies for approval, but I\u2019m sure most people have done that (though maybe not to that extent) to fit in. Because of this lie, she\u2019s at Seta\u2019s mercy. It was fine at first when she showed some restraint to his whims, but as soon as she fell for him, she became all too willing to what it takes to attain his affection. I know that falling in love will change your priorities. But I think Erika lost a lot of her initial gumption where romance wasn\u2019t a big deal to her. I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s a bad character. She shows determination and she\u2019s kindhearted, but it\u2019s nothing shoujo readers/viewers haven\u2019t seen before.\\n\r\nSeta shows the most development throughout. He\u2019s first shown as a kindhearted prince, then he reveals his true sadistic nature. He\u2019s possessive, easily irritated, blunt and mocks Erika mercilessly. Initially, he wouldn\u2019t deter from his principles, even if it ended up hurting Erika. By the end of episode 12, he would still prefer to stay in his comfort zone, but he shows occasional glimpses of compassion towards the people he cares for. Be it Erika or his estranged family members. His not a bad guy deep down, but he\u2019s not a pure person either. He\u2019s perfectly gray, like most people. I can\u2019t really say much more about him at this point, he develops further into the manga.\\n\r\nThen it comes to the actual \u2018love story\u2019. Different people with different background will probably have different perceptions of the relationship. Most of us will conclude that the fake relationship was unhealthy for Erika; some might continue to think it\u2019s unhealthy when they enter the real relationship too. She has high expectations for him, hoping he\u2019ll become a doting boyfriend like the ones she\u2019s been fed through various media outlets. That\u2019s not the case. He\u2019s not that kind of person, and he will never be that kind of person. I think that\u2019s the compelling part about him too. I wished she\u2019d shown the same restraint and kept her initial ideals of not thinking romance was *that* important.\\n\r\nFor my part, I think of this story as a dog falling in love with a cat. It\u2019s difficult, maybe even impossible long term. But it\u2019s interesting enough to watch. \\n",

            "content": "The story is good if not predictable. There are plenty of rewarding moments sprinkled throughout, and it's only 12 episodes so you may have the time to squeeze in this show for that merit alone. It isn't something you should put the current season on hold for, however.\r\nAs a warning to those who depend on relatable characters or characters that they can root for in order to enjoy a show: you will find no such characters here. The characters in this show are well-designed and special enough to stand out from similar stories, but I found it impossible to like them let alone root forthem. However, some people enjoy train wreck characters, and thankfully the show itself is not a train wreck. Trying to watch two dysfunctional people get along in potentially romantic scenarios was entertaining.",

It was a little game they were playing, and she actually left him at one point...but I will not spoil the rest. \r\nThis is a young teen dream. meeting the school hot shot, and him being different, kinder, and more loyal than the rest. Actually, he reminded me of a dog. Obviously, his angry demeanor wasan act, a mask if you will. We don't know the father...he wasn't;t AROUND.\\n\\n\r\nstockholm syndrome for those who use the term incorrectly refers to holding someone captive until they are brainwashed, usually referring to the war when they gave a bowl of rice and played propaganda until the person obliged, maybe receiving some chicken in their bowl of rice...but I will drop it. \\n\\n\r\nCute, fun, anime for the open minded. If you like Kamisama Kiss, or Maidsama highly recommended!",
