            "content": "I laughed...\r\nI cried...\r\nI experienced something that changed my life... \r\nIn a nutshell, Clannad ~After Story~ influenced the way I will live for the rest of my life and not just in some half-assed way like any other show would. It legitimately moved me to make certain decisions, for better or for worse. In that sense, no other anime can compare, as no other anime has provided an equivalent reaction on my part.\r\nBefore you continue, you should know that Clannad ~After Story~ is a continuation of the story from Clannad and an adaptation from the original Visual Novel by KEY. Although knowledge of the first seasonis not necessary, it is highly recommended if you want to get the most out of ~After Story~ as well as this review. That being said, this review is tailored to all readers, and can be understood without knowledge of the first season. Note that there may be very minor spoilers. Now then, on to the meat and potatoes.\\n\\n\r\nI won't spend much time on the individual components of Clannad ~After Story~ (or Clannad ~AS~ as I will call it now) like I have with my other reviews. At first glance, there is nothing notably outstanding about it as a whole. For those who are interested in the individual components, here they are and the reasons behind them are available at the end of the review:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8.7/10\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 8.4/10\\n\r\nSound: 7.8/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 9.7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment (in this case influence): 10+/10 \\n\r\nOverall: 9.8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n| Main Review |\\n\r\nIt is difficult to convey the emotions that went through my mind as I watched Clannad ~AS~. For those of you who watched the first season and dropped the show, I urge you to pick up ~AS~ and give it a chance. The first few episodes run almost identically to those of the first season, but the true After Story part branches off in a manner that is unique only to ~AS~. What Clannad ~AS~ gives the viewer is a story of life. A story of despair. A story of forgiveness. A story of hope. Through this story, Clannad ~AS~ can powerfully change the way you perceive the world around you. I am well aware that not everyone enjoys Clannad and ~AS~, especially since the magical light orbs are outlandish to some, but for me it was a bit of a godsend among anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of Clannad ~AS~ is neither truly unique nor breathtakingly wonderful. What the viewer gets when watching it is the story of a man. Nothing less and nothing more. What Clannad ~AS~ really excels at, however, is the way it tells the story of that man. While it may be classified as a romance or even a harem anime by some (at least the first season could be), I really classify Clannad ~AS~ as a slice of life. A slice out of the life of a delinquent who can\u2019t seem to do anything right and struggles to protect what really matters to him as the world comes crashing down.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, \u201cslice of life\u201d can be a deceptive term. As I watched Clannad ~AS~, it was not as much a slice out of Tomoya\u2019s life but a slice out of mine. You see, what Kyoani succeeds in is hitting on the points that make life truly what it is. The continuation of time. The reality of truth. The genuine meaning of \u201clife goes on.\u201d Additionally, by extending over many years, the true significance of every event begins to emerge. Clannad ~AS~ takes the tale of the first season and shapes it around a single person. It is a respectable reflection of life and delves into what many shows do not, and cannot, represent: the story after the story. \\n\\n\r\nWhile many of the situations may be overblown and excessively dramatized (at least in the opinion of some people), it is ultimately true that every facet of Clannad ~AS~ gives the audience some insight into life. Does it matter that there are miracles and magic orbs of light flying around? For me, no. For others, this could be the case. That is to say, not all aspects of Clannad ~AS~ are perfect, but the impact was enough for me. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a cheerful anime, turn away now. Kyoto Animation does many things with Clannad ~AS~ including some very effective humor in many places, but Clannad ~AS~ will make you cry and smile, often both in the same episode. I won\u2019t lie, I cried at least 5 times throughout the season. Even when rewatching episodes, I cried again. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Clannad ~AS~ really has some happy moments as well, but Kyoani tends to depress many, many times. Each sad moment is profound and beautiful, but nevertheless it is sad. The ending song, Torch, which is played in every episode, serves to alleviate this, for better or worse. Torch is very upbeat, but many people consider it unnecessary and I agree. Torch can be a real mood breaker at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe power that Clannad ~AS~ exerts comes from its characters. While the first season portrayed many main characters and their stories, ~AS~ focuses on the life of Tomoya and lightly on the lives of those who surround him. Tomoya is a failure in a cruel world. In a sense, he is a fatal hero. While he may not know it, he is destined to face pain and suffering through his life. There is a bit of controversy over the ending of ~AS~, but those who wish to have a \u201ctruer\u201d ending can consider the second to last episode as such (don\u2019t hate me for suggesting it). When seen in that light, Clannad ~AS~ effectively played out a story that neither catered to an audience nor skewed reality (except for the orbs of light, of course). What it presented was something that many people can relate to. The loss of a loved one. The pain of recovery. The neglect of a father. Rediscovering love and friendship. Coping with suffering. *SPOILER* The feeling of holding a daughter in your arms for the first time. The pains and joys of being a father. */SPOLER* What it ended with was a realistic ending and a message for the future. Additionally, if seen that way, the last episode can be portrayed as Kyoani staying true to the visual novel and respecting the source material.\\n\\n\r\n*Unfortunately, more talk of the plot would undeniably lead to spoilers, which I am trying to keep free from this review, so please bear with me. Heck, if I\u2019ve convinced you at this point, what are you waiting for? Go see for yourself what all the hype is about. Otherwise, read on!*\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Clannad ~AS~ molded characters that I thought I was familiar with into something close to human. Their stories produced emotion that made me reconsider the situations of the people that I see every day. Through social commentary and moral struggles, the viewer can genuinely begin to respect Tomoya. I know I wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand half of what he did, but I truly began to respect the fact that he kept going, despite him being a fictional character. Through his struggles, I began to learn about myself. Through the struggles of those around him, I began to respect those whom I had once hated. This may seem extreme, and you may think that I am crazy, but what I write is nothing but the truth. Every episode gripped me, and many episodes evoked tearful reactions, which I am not very prone to. As I continued to watch, I could hardly bear waiting a week for each new episode to come out. At the same time, however, I knew that each episode held a bomb - a flood of emotions that could affect the rest of my day. Clannad ~AS~ went way beyond enjoyment \u2013 it went into the realm of what I could call an \u201cepiphany.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nCan the story of one man influence the lives of others? Is it still possible if that man is a fictional character? For me, I did not think it was possible for anime to extend its influence at such a level. Clannad ~AS~ proved me wrong time and time again. Look past the first season and the first few episodes, and perhaps you can begin to understand what I mean. \\n\\n\r\nFor those interested or who can relate after watching the show, this is the ultimate and most powerful result of the show as it applies to me. The following is the reason why I can\u2019t keep my mind off of Clannad ~AS~ and the reason why it will remain as my #1 favorite for what I know will be many, many seasons: *SPOILER* Through Clannad ~AS~, I have basically committed to wanting to have a baby. Ushio love. */SPOILER*\\n\\n\\n\r\n| Analysis of components |\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nClannad ~AS~ is unique in its storytelling, but the story itself is nothing special. The earlier episodes present almost unrelated stories just as the first season did, but Clannad ~AS~ takes a turn for the better with a focus on a single character and his ordeal. At this point, Clannad ~AS~ does nothing but follow the life of a young adult, Tomoya. Sure there is drama (oh, is there drama) and there is romance, in a sense, but in reality, there is no real plot to speak of. What there is, however, is the tale of a life experience that can change the way you live. A real deterrent might come from some of the magic that inexplicably finds its way into Clannad (both seasons), but that never really bothered me. The ending is also less-than-stellar and can be a bit confusing, but as stated before, there\u2019s always the second to last episode to fall back on.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nThere is nothing blatantly wrong with the animation quality. Kyoto Animation produced Clannad ~AS~, so fans will know that there is nothing to fear. The character design is the same as that of Clannad and other KEY adaptations. The KEY character design is quite distinguishable, with its giant eyes. Personally, I am a fan, but other viewers might dislike the artwork. Other than that, Kyoani did another solid job with the animation, and there are no jerky movements that detract from the gorgeous lessons that unfold.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nKyoani had its ups and downs with the music for Clannad ~AS~. In many aspects, Clannad ~AS~ shoots beyond other KEY adaptations with its unique, unconventional plotline and incredibly well enacted scenes of what could very well be the life of an individual. In fact, many of the ordeals that Tomoya must face strike a particularly strong emotional chord among many people. Who knows, you might not be that certain type of person, but I definitely was. Anyways\u2026 back to the music. Clannad ~AS~\u2019s opening sequence is a strong piano melody with deceptively deep lyrics. However, the ending sequence detracts from many of the spectacular moments, especially because Kyoani tends to end episodes on a sad note. As such, many would classify Torch (the ED) as an elaborate troll because it is too lively. Beyond the OP and ED, Clannad ~AS~ features tracks from the Visual Novel, which include very familiar tracks from the first season. Notable among these are the songs with lyrics, ie Ana. Certain parts of the OST mesh very well, and a powerful soundtrack can produce a powerful reaction. However, I don\u2019t remember anything in particular clearly standing out to me, and as previously mentioned, Torch ruined quite a few strong moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWhile most of the other aspects of Clannad ~AS~ are very similar to their counterparts in the first season, character development in ~AS~ take a turn for the better. Kyoani successfully made me hate characters that I loved and love characters that I hated. Through a roller coaster complete with dips and turns, Clannad ~AS~ changed the way I perceive all type of people. From Tomoya\u2019s seemingly disinterested, alcoholic father to Nagisa, a character who I actually deemed annoying in the first season, I came to understand what truly makes up a person. Every character really has a story behind their dejected or cheerful fa\u00e7ade. Despite the usual \u201cClannad magic,\u201d every character also turned out to be associable, adding to the personal level of the show. Even the more comical, secondary characters had their share of emotional moments, giving them real depth and giving the viewer a relatively accurate understanding of human nature. About half-way through the show, there is a certain character that changes many, many things. I won\u2019t spoil it now, but her unique appearance is what truly brought Clannad ~AS~ to unmatchable levels.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\r\nEnjoyment is really up to the beholder. My view of enjoyment may be somewhat different from others\u2019. Clannad is not for everybody, but for those who dropped the first season, ~AS~ is truly on a league of its own and worth another shot. Every person has that one anime that leaps up above the rest and leaves a lasting impression. For me, that anime was Clannad ~AS~. No other words can describe the effect it had on me, and I hope that this review has at least made you, the reader, consider picking up this diamond in the rough.\\n\\n\\n\r\n| Final Thoughts |\\n\r\nThank you for your time (I know the review was long), and I sincerely wish that you give Clannad ~AS~ a chance. Who knows, it may change your life. As always, comments about how effectively this review worked are welcome. Also, a helpful rating is always appreciated.",

            "content": "Recently I had the absolute pleasure of watching Clannad: After Story.  I had previously seen the original Clannad and liked it as a light-hearted slice of life anime, good but not amazing.  I went into After Story expecting the same thing, but what I got was something fantastically different.\r\nStory- 10/10\r\nAs I said before, I started After Story expecting it to have the same light-hearted high school drama feel as the first season and, unfortunately, the first eight episodes did nothing to prove me wrong.  The first eight episodes are Clannad at its storytelling worst, more specifically the Sunohara arc.  Thankfully, Clannadat its storytelling worst is simply \"okay\".  The Sunohara arc makes Youhei's younger sister, Mei, seem like a nosy and irrational little girl in contrast to the mature-beyond-her-years character that the writers seemed to be trying to present her as.  The Yukine arc was better, but it pushes the boundaries of Tomoya's \"good Samaritan\" personality a bit too far.  The Misae arc is good by itself, but has very little to do with the story or the characters that we care about.  If it weren't for each arc each containing details that are vital to the enjoyment of understanding of the later part of the anime, I would recommend skipping the first eight episodes altogether to get straight to the real good stuff.\\n\r\nThankfully, the latter part of After Story more than makes up for its mediocre first act with the absolute greatest storytelling in anime.  After Story quickly gets back on its feet and shows what truly makes it great as we ride the greatest emotional rollercoaster in recent memory.  The ending has caused some controversy for being too ambiguous to fully understand without having played the video game, but I feel otherwise.  Granted, I had to see the anime twice before I truly understood it, but I was nonetheless able to figure out exactly what happened without any outside help.  It's a tough one, but it's very possible.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile the main setting has its moments of visual awe, the artistic aspect of the anime truly shines in the beautiful and surreal \"hidden world\".  The impact differs greatly from the main world, boasting beautiful lighting, animation, and colors.  In the main world, colors do a great job of changing from bright to dull based on the situation and animation is polished to a shine.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI've always been a big fan of a musical score acting as a compliment to whats happening on screen rather than a mere accompaniment.  Clannad: After Story masterfully pairs its score with each event to further the emotional impact of each scene.  It is done so well, in fact, that one cannot hear the music on its own without feeling some kind of emotion attached to that song by a certain event from the anime.  The OP is good and very versatile in setting the correct emotional tone for each episode.  On the downside, the bouncy, poppy ED is often horribly inappropriate to the emotions that you are left with at the end of each episode and is almost guaranteed to ruin the mood if you aren't quick enough to stop it.  I found myself sometimes ending the episode early when the scene seemed like an ending due to my fear of facing the buzzkill of an ED.\\n\r\nOn the voice acting side, the English performances are top-notch.  Each character is paired with a voice that fits their appearance and personality very well and that can easily be recognized among other voices.  Luci Christian gives a flawless performance as both English Nagisa and Ushio, and Andrew Love does really great stuff with the situations he is put in as Akio.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are without a doubt the strongest aspect of After Story.  Each one is as incredibly human as they are likable, and their easiness to get attached to is one of the biggest reasons that the anime has such a great emotional impact.  When the characters are suffering, it as if one of our friends is suffering, and when they are happy, we are happy for them.  I have never felt such an attachment to a set of characters as I did in After Story.  Each character plays so well off of each other, including Tomoya and Nagisa, who are without a doubt the greatest couple in anime.  In most stories, be it in books, cinema, or television, the romance sub plot is almost always one of two things, the incredibly good-looking and nice alpha-male protagonist gets paired with the incredibly good-looking romantic interest, or the incredibly good-looking and nice but shy protagonist gets paired with the incredibly good-looking romantic interest.  In both scenarios, the two characters are always blessed with the perfect personalities and that's why they go so well together.  Tomoya and Nagisa are different.  Neither of them have perfect personalities, but both of their personalities are able to compliment the other's.  Tomoya's hot headedness is able to be cooled by Nagisa's quiet, strong demeanor.  It's not perfect gets paired with perfect, it's human finds human.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAfter I finished Clannad: After Story for the first time, there was only one thing I wanted to do: watch the entire series again, so I did.  I know that the word \"experience\" is overused in film and television, but that's exactly what After Story is.  I don't cry during movies or anime.  I've seen Elfen Lied, Old Yeller, My Dog Skip, Grave of the Fireflies, etc.  You name it, I've seen it and didn't shed a tear.  Clannad: After Story made me cry like a girl multiple times, and the reason it did is because it's different from anything else I've ever seen before in one way.  It is able to appeal to the most human parts of you, whether it's Tomoya's responsibility as a man or Nagisa's inherent ability to remain positive for the sake of the people she loves, the one thing that makes this anime so emotionally powerful is the fact that you could see it happening to you.",

            "content": "Emotions are a powerful thing; they have the capability to override any modicum of rationality and force even the ficklest of beings to succumb to their emotional disposition. Due to this, often times, those of us who claim ourselves to be critics of various mediums fall short of our own expectations. \u201cClannad After Story\u201d, a series described as \u201clife-changing\u201d by many is the perfect suspect; a production that captured the hearts of the majority that viewed it while instantly becoming a classic within its genre. Littered with subpar designed moe characters, irrelevant arcs, contradictory elements, forced plot devices, and a plethora of other obvious issues,it truly is baffling how effective an appeal to pathos can be. Although, the series has plenty of redeeming qualities, the title it has so profusely clenched--that of a masterpiece by a large consensus, must indeed be questioned.\\n\\n\r\n--Story/Plot :5/10--\\n\\n\r\n\u201cAfter Story\u201d takes place right after the first season of Clannad and chronicles the lives of certain characters from the first season, primarily focusing on Tomoya, his relationship with Nagisa and more importantly, himself.  It attempts to bring a sense of realism to its viewer through the joys and hardships that Tomoya goes through and accomplishes that for a while. It also eliminates the harem aspect of season one and adopts a much more serious tone.\\n\\n\r\nThe series spans 24-episodes with the first 10-episodes composed of various arcs dealing with other characters and their corresponding dilemmas while the rest of the show focuses on the primary protagonists. This brings up the problem of structure and inconsistency. The initial problem with \u201cAfter Story\u201d is the characters that are focused on for the first 10 episodes. With the exception of the Misae arc as it LOOSELY connects to the magical component of the show, the other arcs have no direct relevance to the overarching story nor do they serve any function in moving the plot, but are just thrown in there, forcing unnecessary drama. This also causes a huge gap in consistency between the first part of the show and the rest, especially in regards to quality. However, the next few episodes are a pleasure to watch as they highlight Tomoya\u2019s evolution as a character along with his relationship with Nagisa. Structurally, \u201cAfter Story\u201d fell short, consequently causing a gap in quality and consistency. \\n\\n\r\nSubstantially, \u201cAfter Story\u201d has its share of delightful moments, but those are restricted to a very limited amount of episodes. The story is unoriginal, but imbues concepts and themes that are very real and relatable such as: imploring responsibility and growing up, the innateness of hardships, the importance of relationships, moving on, and many others that are close to home. Yet, \u201cAfter Story\u201d manages to ruin the very thing it tries to achieve. The show spends a great deal of time trying to evoke \u201crealism\u201d through manifesting the aforementioned themes, but subsequently destroys that with its detachment from reality and deus ex machina resolve. For example, one of the arcs in the earlier part of the series shows how two supposedly bitter and rival gangs end up being bros4lyfe via some [extraneous] female side-character. I may not have a proper grasp on gang psychology, but I\u2019m fairly certain that the odds of something like a dudefest and \u201cunderstanding\u201d blossoming between two rival gangs are astronomical. This notion of \u201cbonds of friendships overcoming everything\u201d is extremely over exaggerated deeming many of the earlier arcs unrealistic,  effectively leaving me in a state of overwhelming ennui. \\n\\n\r\nFor a series that tries to emphasize real life, especially while trying to deal with issues such as loss, acceptance, etc., it negates all validity by embracing a faux idealism grounded in wish fulfillment. The realism juxtaposed with magical idealism/wish fulfillment really disintegrates the show by the end. However, that is probably one of the overarching reasons the show is as popular it is, because instead of staying true to its realistic core, it defaults into fantasy, idealism, and wish fulfillment. It\u2019s successful but at the cost of complete contradiction therefore making After Story somewhat of a Pyrrhic victory. It should be noted that there is nothing wrong with having a plot based on supernatural/metaphysical notions, however, when the show is simultaneously trying to bring a strong sense of realism to the front, it becomes counter-productive and contradictory. I can\u2019t even incorporate this under efficient \u201cmagical realism\u201d because of how badly the two are handled when looked at as a pair. \\n\\n\r\nEssentially, where \u201cAfter Story\u201d excels at is deception. It does an excellent job serenading its viewer into a false lull making it seem exponentially better than it actually is by manipulating sympathetic themes and completely over exaggerating them, however, when dissected the story offers nothing unique, let alone life altering. It\u2019s a good effort, but that\u2019s all it is, an effort, that has its comely yet ephemeral moments. Conclusively, \"After Story\" ends up stumbling within its own narrative and resolution.\\n\\n\r\n--Character: 6/10--\\n\\n\r\n \u201cAfter Story\u201d gets a ridiculous amount of praise for having \u201chuman-like\u201d characters, however, the series lacks greatly in terms of balanced characterization. Tomoya is well developed and one can partly empathize with his struggles as he tries to shuffle through the various challenges he encounters. Tomoya\u2019s progression is probably the most realistic part of the show and is fairly well-executed. While the show gives us a dynamic Tomoya, we are left face-palming in deep regret and resentment with the lack of attention given to Nagisa. There is nothing memorable about her; struck with some unknown illness, we often see her washing dishes for like three continuous episodes. I felt no sort of attachment, relation, or even empathy towards Nagisa, rather her lack of progression had the opposite effect. Her static, ing\u00e9nue personality got unbearable. Oh and she can\u2019t hold her liquor. That just heightened my insouciance even further. The futility of Nagisa truly is a burden on \u201cAfter Story\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nThe over-development of one protagonist and under-development of the other did not have a neutralizing effect, but a detrimental one. Their relationship is the foundation of \u201cAfter Story\u201d but it remains immature, mainly due to Nagisa\u2019s incomplete characterization. Instead of spending the initial 10 episodes on completely useless characters, the series could have utilized the same time to construct Nagisa into a character with dimension, personality, and purpose. The show spent so much time trying to build this false delusion about how \u201cfriendship solves everything\u201d that essential aspects got completely disregarded. Tomoya along with an unmentioned character carry the weight of \u201cAfter Story\u201d.  In hopes of keeping this review spoiler free, only the two main protagonists (Tomoya x Nagisa) are discussed.\\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of supporting/side characters in the show, some making cameos (from season one), others for reasons I have yet to understand. The only notable side characters are Nagisa\u2019s parents who provide some comedic relief (which is the same recycled humor of the first season) but they still manage to maintain their likability. \\n\\n\r\n--Art/Animation: 7/10--\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t hold your breath expecting anything aesthetically orgasmic. The girls are molded with \u201cmoe\u201d in mind at all times: Unrealistic character designs for a \u201crealistic\u201d anime.  In terms of the actual art, \u201cAfter Story\u201d does a fairly good job. Bright colors are often used to accompany the magical atmosphere and vibrancy of life that the show is grounded upon. There are instances of visually striking scenes scattered here and there, especially with some of the natural backgrounds. There is always light illuminating from somewhere, even in the darker scenes. The one place where the animation did shine is while depicting the \u201cillusionary\u201d world. The background, colors, and overall depiction of that world is nicely done as it provides a very surreal atmosphere to the viewer. However, don\u2019t expect gorgeous animation akin to something like \u201c5 centimeter\u201d. It\u2019s nice, but nothing exceptional. \\n\\n\r\n--Sound: 6/10--\\n\\n\r\n\u201cAfter Story\u201d has a viable soundtrack that fit its purposes. Composed of subtle, soft, and sometimes melancholic piano music, the OST is pleasant, but conventional. It wasn't something that compelled me to go download or re-listen to. The same applies to the OP/ED selections. They are very imminent and \u201cof-the-moment\u201d in the sense that they are enjoyable and appropriate at the time they played. However, I almost always forwarded the OP and rarely listened to ED. The voice actors are fitting in regards to their respective roles.\\n\\n\r\n--Overall/Enjoyment: 6/10--\\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly, \u201cAfter Story\u201d is at the forefront its genre because of its inherent ability to capitalize on emotions and \u201cfeels\u201d to the point where many \u201cmanly\u201d tears are shed and lives are changed. However, I could not relate; as the anime defied all levels of logic with convenient plot devices, contradicted its own pursuit of realism, over-dramatized situations, wasted 11 episodes of my time with frankly fatuous arcs, and underestimated the importance of complete characterization--emotions no longer mattered. After all, feels and impact are evanescent, quality is what remains. \\n\\n\r\n\"After Story\u201d therefore didn\u2019t really leave a strong impact on me nor did I learn some particularly significant lesson about life nor did I put my feels on suicide watch. Nevertheless, the four or five episodes towards the middle/end are truly poignant and laudable\u2014if  \u201cAfter Story\u201d  could have maintained that level of quality throughout and refrained from committing some of the aforementioned blunders, the series would have lived up to its hype. Alas, I cannot rate a 24-episode series any higher based on my enjoyment of five episodes. My \u201cAfter Story\u201d experience is a step away from the norm and that\u2019s the reason I spewed all of this\u2014to offer some solace to those who couldn\u2019t cry those manly tears or indulge in wish fulfillment, while also providing another perspective to those who have yet to watch it that isn\u2019t soaked in sheer \u201cfeels\u201d. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "*Yet another successful heart warming series produced by Kyoto Animation that surpasses its predecessor.*\r\n\u201c\u2026 an astounding series with a slightly less astounding conclusion.\u201d\r\nDue to the frequent references to Clannad (first season), from here on, the term \u201cClannad\u201d will be used when referring to season 1 and \u201cAfter Story\u201d will be used for season 2 and the term \u201cClannad After Story\u201d will be used when referring to the Clannad series as a whole. A few friendly reminders before we begin. After Story is a direct continuation of Clannad, thus it is not very \u201cnew audience-friendly\u201d. Knowledge of certain key events and character relations are expected fromviewers. Again, due to After Story being a direct continuation (in story) from Clannad, and the latter ended with a climax of sort, it is unreasonable for us to expect After Story to start off with the same level of intensity. In layman\u2019s term, don\u2019t expect the show to start with a bang.\\n\\n\r\nWhat exactly is After Story? In short, it is an emotion evoking machine designed in such a way as to suck dry your tears. By combining music, dialogue, and animation (often from the facial expression), After Story has the ability to dominate even the mightiest cold blooded person on this planet. Crappy live drama should learn/adopt some of the plots/techniques used in the anime. They should be ashamed of themselves because some anime by the name of Clannad After Story can present a much better dramatic story as a whole. In addition, After Story can squeeze the deep down juicy emotions inside you that not much live drama (if there is any) can ever accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nThose who are familiar with Clannad should have no difficulty identifying various strong points evident in After Story (such as high quality animation), but perhaps one may not be too familiar with the weaknesses of After Story. While some may claim the following \u201cugly\u201d facts to be minor issues, it is only fair on my part to present both sides of an argument, so to speak.\\n\\n\r\nInappropriate ending theme. The MUSIC makes Clannad what it is (more into that later), but sadly there are occasions when the ending theme just ruins everything the episode worked so hard for. It is important to note that the ED song itself is not bad; it just does not fit in especially with the latter half of After Story.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cClannad Magic\u201d. The magic might work on some viewers, but for the rest of us who are looking for a more realistic story it was somewhat a let down to say the very least. I still recall people used to ask me the difference between Kanon and Clannad, and usually my reply will be the following, \u201c\u2026 well Clannad is the more realistic version of Kanon as far as the main story between the protagonists is concerned \u2026 nothing too supernatural \u2026\u201d but the magical performance totally destroyed it. \\n\\n\r\nAs previously stated, the author of this review (ie. me) is simply presenting issues of what seem to be hindrances to After Story from achieving a perfect 10/10 masterpiece for some demanding viewers. In fact, After Story is a show overwhelmed with prettiness. Depending on your definition of prettiness it could mean any or all of the following but let me assure you that there is absolutely no exaggeration involved.\\n\\n\r\nLyrics, Music and BGM! Normally song lyrics are not a big factor in an anime, but After Story\u2019s OP is just too fabulous to ignore. Slowly, I began to learn the meaning behind the song. If you read the lyrics in detail, it is clear that the song is a summary of the story of Clannad After Story. A particularly heart warming chunk of the song lyrics is provided below.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe chilly days continue on, even though it\u2019s already spring.\\n\r\nOn the mornings I woke earlier than the alarm clock,\\n\r\nYou, making breakfast for three,\\n\r\nWould be standing there.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI would refrain myself from explaining the meanings behind the lyrics, but I hope you can have a rough picture of what kind of story Clannad is getting at just by that one simple verse. You can find the lyrics (in English and Japanese) from the link below. \\n\\n\r\nhttp://bambooxzx.wordpress.com/2008/11/13/clannad-after-story-toki-wo-kizamu-uta-2/\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, music is one of the key features making Clannad After Story a successful business. Music in Clannad After Story is not simply music. Likewise, BGM is not simply BGM either in the context of After Story. They blend in with the animation, characters, and story. They all compliment each other to bring out the maximum effect to each scene.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation! The animation quality is slightly better than previous Key adapations by Kyoto Animation. For those who are not familiar with the producer, Kyoto Animation (products include Kanon (2006), AIR, Full Metal Panic series, Lucky Star, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Kiddy Grade, et cetera.) has a pretty good reputation for its high level animation. Simply put, one will be find nothing but beautifully drawn girls, dynamic backgrounds, silky smooth scenes transition, and completely fluid movements in this touching anime. There is, however, not much difference (if at all) in the quality between Clannad and After Story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters! One great thing about the characters in Clannad After Story is no matter if they are main or supporting casts, they all seem to be part of a jigsaw puzzle. The show would not be the same without any one of them. What makes After Story superior from its predecessor is its focus on the main protagonists (ie. Nagisa and Tomoya) for the most part of the show. This is evidently lacking in season one because other heroines\u2019 story had to be covered, thus leading to an ambiguous character relationships development between Tomoya and various heroines. Although not a major Nagisa fan myself, one should realize the importance of her character and how it all connect to the story\u2019s main theme. \\n\\n\r\nStory! After Story is all about the story! It is by far the prettiest of all the pretty traits that one can think of about Clannad After Story. On the whole, the Clannad series is an astounding series with a slightly less astounding ending. Slightly less astounding partly due to the magic, but could also be due to another reason. Assuming some of us has been paying attention to what Kotomi has been explaining regarding the works of her parents, then perhaps we can take a more scientific analytical approach to the ending via something known as the Omega Point Theory. Due to the lack of spoiler tags, further analysis of the ending will not be possible for this review. However, the following blog will prove to be extremely valuable. \\n\\n\r\nhttp://animewriter.wordpress.com/2009/03/14/clannad-after-story-22-the-conclusion-the-place-where-wishes-come-true/\\n\\n\r\nLet us just say that the story for Clannad After Story is deep and \u201cpretty\u201d, and leave it at that. \\n\\n\r\n***If you find the overall concept and plot of the Clannad series confusing, please visit the following link and it should clear things up.\\n\\n\r\nhttp://i527.photobucket.com/albums/cc354/KaminaKun/Others/1236943573387.png\\n\\n\r\n --> thanks goes to fellow member Eternal-Dragon for providing me with the diagram.***\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, Clannad is LIFE, period. It lets you experience a wide variety of emotions such as anger, jealousy, joy, love, sorrow, pain, hardship, friendship, and most importantly the care from your family. From the ridiculous comedies presented by Sunohara (or Fuko), to the naivety shown by Nagisa (or Fuko), one can always relate characters and/or events in Clannad to some direct/indirect personal experiences. Additionally, Clannad also teach you the meaning to LIFE. Next time when you are on the verge of starting an argument with your parents, just think about Tomoya and his dad. Think of all the hardships and difficulties your parents went through to feed you and raise you to make you become who you are. You will never know, maybe Clannad can really teach you a thing or two.\\n\\n\r\nIn an unrelated note, for those who enjoyed watching the Nagisa x Tomoya pairing and at the same time disliked the magical performances throughout the show (particularly the ending), then it is recommended that you give the Clannad movie a try.",

            "content": "\"Do you like this school? I really, really love it. But nothing can stay unchanged. Fun things... Happy things... They can't all possibly stay unchanged. Even so, can you keep on loving this place?\" \r\nHow does one cope in a world that is always changing? And are we ever truly alone? \r\nThe above questions are foundational to the series of Clannad After Story, a story of love, loss, redemption, happiness, sadness, togetherness, and change.\r\nI will start by commending Key, the brains behind this show. Like other works of theirs, (Notably Kanon, Air, and the first season of Clannad), it is beautifully written and incredibly aestheticallydetailed, with well designed environments and a soundtrack that fits the context to a tee. Added to the compelling characters, this anime is in my somewhat biased opinion a masterpiece. I'll start with the story.\\n\\n\r\nAs a story by Key, I went into the anime with some expectations. Not only was I not disappointed, I was sent from small fits of laughter to open sobs and bawling more quickly than I would have liked (very manly, testosterone-charged sobs and bawling, of course).\\n\\n\r\nThe anime starts right near the end of the first season of Clannad and picks up quickly. Nearly all of those \"minor\" characters from the first season are given more time, their stories are displayed in a very accessible manner, and there is a feeling of very little \"filler\". Almost all of the characters have you caring about them (and feeling happy or sad for their situations,) by the time the story ends.\\n\\n\r\nThese stories play out against the backdrop of Nagisa and Tomoya's relationship, their trials and happy times, as Tomoya becomes a man of society. A distinct shift of the angle and scope of the anime is witnessed, as Tomoya moves into the \"real world\". One of my favorite parts of the story came from the implementation of Nagisa's parents, Akio and Sanae. I will discuss this implementation later.\\n\\n\r\nDuring most of the story, I felt as if I was actually living the lives of the characters I was watching. Realistic scripting, well chosen voice actors (Mostly the same from the first season), and strong writing right from the beginning gave me the impression that this could actually be a real story, happening somewhere on the planet (with some minor exceptions that are related to the story).\\n\\n\r\nThe themes of change and family are expressed continuously, from the changing city to the powerful interconnectedness of family, friends, or larger communities. The OP and ED become more powerful as the story continues on, and the connections made to the first season are near perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThere is more than one climax to this story, and it is barely short of amazing how there can be so much emotion packed into 24 episodes (though the 24 of the first season play a role here). \\n\\n\r\nThe ending was very pretty, I especially liked the ending of the 24th \"recap\" episode (which I would consider a part of the After Story experience as it provides some final closure).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story is so beautifully done that aside from one potentially confusing part near the end, the plot is watertight and expressed in a way that is easy to connect with. Next I will discuss the art and sound.\\n\\n\r\nIf the entire After Story anime consisted of just the OP and ED, I would have awarded it somewhere around an 8.5. The combination of theme song (Toki wo Kizamu Uta by Lia,) and stunning visuals sent shivers down my spine many of the times I watched it. Both the OP and ED gain more as the story goes on, as more subtle details are revealed in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nI have always been a big fan of the Key visual style, but the visual style of this anime is very impressive. The characters as can be expected are very well detailed, but what is stunning about this anime is the amount of detail in the environments. Every building and nearly every person, near or far, important or not, is well detailed. Seeing the wood grain in a power pole when the pole is barely hanging in the scene. Or the swaying of each individual plant in a field during sunset, as the orangeish hue nearly matches that of a sunset in the real world. This and more all combines to produce a very appealing look and serves to immerse the viewer in a world that is not their own (though one might wish it were, for how pretty it is).\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is impressive. Many of the songs come from the first season, but  some less well used songs in the original get used more often in this season. The choice of where the soundtrack is implemented is pivotal, and this anime is very good at knowing when to emphasize the emotion or when to provide a contrast that might nudge the viewer, \"Time still goes forward; life still goes on!\" \\n\\n\r\nLastly, I will talk about what I believe is the most important portion of any story, and especially so for this one: the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Story provides an amazing level of character depth. None of the first season of Clannad is forgotten, and various past issues and memories are brought back. \\n\\n\r\nThe development of the \"minor\" characters plays a very important role in this anime. Though Tomoya is the main character, one gets the sense that there are no arbitrary characters in the anime at all. Everyone has a past, a story, and a place where they can fit into the extended family of Tomoya. \\n\\n\r\nTomoya is one of the most realistically portrayed anime characters I have seen in some time. Viewers will remember him as the slightly hot-headed but caring figure from the first season. Tomoya undergoes a remarkable transformation in this series, and the contrast (which is well-emphasized in After Story) is very well done.  Finally, I want to take a quick second to recognize something I liked that Key did with this anime: the implementation of Nagisa's parents.\\n\\n\r\nThough they had relatively brief appearances in the first season, Akio and Sanae play incredibly powerful roles in After Story. They are characterized as deeply caring parents that will do anything for the happiness of their family. They stand as a beacon of love and support for both Nagisa and Tomoya, and can be as funny as they are compassionate.Though not always on the front lines, viewers can expect any issues encountered by the characters to be thoughtfully and thoroughly dealt with by these two.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime is borderline phenomenal. In between moments of laughing and crying, there is a plethora of amazing characters, portrayed with the right music, detailed in beautiful environments, and built into a fantastic story that is very pretty, both in concept and implementation. I would heavily recommend this anime to anyone who is into Key stuff, who has seen Clannad, or just someone who wants to use a whole box of tissues from all of the happy/sad crying one is bound to do. \\n\\n\r\nIn response to the first quote of this (longer than I had expected) review in the words of Tomoya, \\n\\n\r\n\"Just find them; just find new fun and happy things. C'mon, let's get going.\"\\n\\n",

            "content": "The original series, the highly rated \"Clannad\", was one painful viewing experience for me - not because it's full of tragic tales, but because of how dire it is. Female characters sugary enough to induce diabetes in a lump of rock, combined with atrociously forced \"drama\" fast tracked it to a lofty position on my \"Overrated Shite\" list. And yet its ratings pales in comparison to that of its sequel, \"Clannad: After Story\".\r\nGiven my experiences with the first series, I hadn't originally intended to watch \"Clannad: After Story\", but people kept telling me how much better it was and how different it was compared tothe first season. Intrigued, I decided to give it shot...\\n\\n\r\n...and boy was I disappointed.\\n\\n\r\n\"Clannad: After Story\" was supposedly a different kettle of fish from \"Clannad\", but it's obvious to me that it's the same kettle, with mostly the same fish inside - it's still very moe; the melodrama is still clumsily manipulative; it's still unmistakably \"Clannad\".\\n\\n\r\nUnlike \"Clannad\" though, \"Clannad: After Story\" is somewhat inconsistent. But I mean that as a back hand compliment, in that \"Clannad: After Story\" had the some good moments amongst the crap, while \"Clannad\" was just consistently crap.\\n\\n\r\nThe first part of \"Clannad: After Story\" is almost indistinguishable from \"Clannad\". It continues from where the original series left off, taking on a similar format comprising mini-arcs of various happenings around the school. Since Tomoya and Brown Haired Girl are already an item at the start of this series, there is no longer a harem aspect. You would think this would improve things, but in the case of this anime, all it meant was that it concentrated on mass producing contrived melodrama instead.\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc, starring Sunohara, was one of the worst offenders. It started off as a comedy, and although some parts were a bit tasteless, it was at least tolerable. Half way through though, it tried to turn into a serious drama, and it was all downhill from there on. The problem is that, as with most stories involving Sunohara, the comedy is quite ridiculous, involving an absurd set up that you simply can't take seriously, but the drama directly extends from that set up, and the anime seems to think it's fine to try and deliver emotional punches off this same platform that was used to deliver goofy punchlines shortly before. There are also glaring problems in the plot and inconsistencies in the portrayal of Sunohara's character, but the real crux is this: these problems are not oversights - these are the consequences of the show's willingness to sacrifice everything in order to crank up drama to 11. Not surprising then, that I found it so unconvincing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so \"Clannad: After Story\" continues in typical \"Clannad\" fashion, spinning implausible, almost surreal sob stories about its bizarrely troubled characters ... until around episode 10. This is the point where Tomoya and his ex-harem members graduate and make their way into the big wide world. It marks the beginning of what made many consider \"Clannad: After Story\" to be one of the greatest anime ever made. So I approached the show renewed hope...\\n\\n\r\n...only to be disappointed once more.\\n\\n\r\nHowever much \"Clannad: After Story\" changes its settings, it still approaches drama with the subtle touch of a rapist. While I admit that the show does mature somewhat, its maturity is much like the way Brown Haired Girl matures during the show - she became more like a 15 year-old than a 10 year-old. An improvement it may be, but it's debatable whether this 50% increase in maturity is worthy of lavish praise when \\n\\n\r\n1) the initial bar was set so stupidly low, and \\n\r\n2) she's supposed to be in her twenties by the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nBut allow me to pause in the middle of my acid spewing in order to acknowledge that there are definitely merits found in this part of the story, and that's enough to make it by far the best part of the whole franchise.\\n\\n\r\nAs is always the case, these best parts centred around Tomoya himself and not some dipshit moe girl or some other retarded side character. One of the stories dealt with Tomoya trying to settle into a job and striving to overcome, amongst other difficulties, his physical handicap. This I liked, because above all, it was unembellished, believable drama - he actually had plausible real world problems to deal with, which isn't something to take for granted in the world of \"Clannad\", despite it often being labelled as a real life drama.\\n\\n\r\nIt's fair to say that the franchise would be a lot worse without Tomoya; he was almost carrying the show single handedly. But there was one other, newly introduced in \"Clannad: After Story\", who shared his burden of being a rare good character stuck in the cesspit of shit ones. It's not too surprising then, that the stretch of episodes focusing almost solely on the two of them are the best ones that \"Clannad: After Story\" has to offer. Its emotional apex, a gorgeous scene set in a field of golden flowers tinted red in the setting sun, is hands down the most touching moment in the combined two seasons of the show. Emotional but not forcefully so, it captured the central theme of family with a poignancy and sincerity that's most unusual for the show.\\n\\n\r\nBut that, I'm afraid, is the last remaining good thing I have to say about \"Clannad: After Story\".\\n\\n\r\nIn between the aforementioned high points, and even entwined with them, crappy arcs and sub-plots are found in abundance. Amongst them, there's the incident of an all important decision reached via baseball, and another one that dealt with matters between Tomoya and his dad. The former looks to be an instance of \"Clannad: After Story\" trying to be subtle by approaching the matter at hand in a round-a-bout manner, in the same way that an elephant might try to do ballet; the latter is another classic case of the show sacrificing its characters to the drama. Time and time again over the course of the two seasons I witnessed Human Plot Device, aka Tomoya's dad, demonstrate his immense capability by taking on whatever personality the plot required, and this unsurprisingly resulted in his character feeling like an unfathonable, contradicting mess.\\n\\n\r\nTo say the remaining episodes were unsatisfactory would be an understatement. To begin with there was the re-appearance of one of the most fucking annoying characters I've ever had misfortune of encountering, which invoked more sadness within me than all the sad stories in the whole series put together. And then there's the ending. I don't want to give spoilers, so I'll just say that not only was it confusing, but I would have felt cheated if I didn't have so little emotional investment in the show to be cheated out of.\\n\\n\r\nThat aside, there's also some weird business going on with the ending to the main story not being the last episode of the series. There are two more episodes after the main ending: the first one is an alternative reality side story; the other one, the final episode, is just a recap. It's as if the show was going for the most anti-climatic end to a series ever. The purpose of throwing in that side story eludes me, but the re-cap's summarising did help to make the ending clearer. It doesn't clear up everything though, and there are major plot elements that remain baffling to the end. I did come across an informative time line that made references to the visual novel, and in all honesty, I was quite impressed with the grand scheme of what I saw. Unfortunately, various aspects of the plot failed to translate during the adaptation. Most notably, the visual novel mechanics they tried to port across caused plenty of confusion. The irony is that by trying to be more faithful to the source material, the anime actually ended up being worse off.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the ending is just a single nail in a rather large coffin; the show's problems run far deeper, right down to the conceptual level. Other than being filled with moe blobs that barely qualifies as characters, I get the impression that the franchise has been developed from a completely wrong approach. Instead of starting with some good ideas and letting them grow into good stories organically, it feels like the writers started with the intention of making the biggest fucking weepfest ever, then threw in whatever ludicrous ideas that came into their heads in order to achieve their goal. As a result, values like story and character integrity were continuously being compromised to make the show more tragic superficially. This might have been forgivable if it only happened on occasion, but when it's the bread and butter aspects of the story, the end product simply isn't a good drama.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just emotion pr0n.",

            "content": "After watching many anime and reading many manga, I would recommend Clannad AS to most people just as strongly as when I first finished it. (I cry to it just as much too.) What sets After Story apart for me is the encompassing world it develops in addition to the main story. The completeness of the narrative is beautiful and rare, since many other media products of our time give up on telling a complete story for a variety of reasons. A plethora of stories are all told at once for the imaginative viewer who appreciates all of the series' nuances. Without spoilers, by thefinal episode many if not all side characters have matured and you feel this maturity authentically. This leads you to consider how you yourself, your friends, your family, and your community have matured. I think After Story appeals most to reflective viewers.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Story is quintessentially Japanese with no compromises. It both frames the world with elements of traditional culture (slightly patriarchal approach to relationship with fragile female protagonist, refusing money from parents for the sake of honor, immediate respect for grandparent) and shows the world with elements of modern life (changing city, new construction, environmental preservation, long working hours). (Also, there aren't yet cell phones, which itself is fascinating to think about for sociological purposes.) This is both refreshing and realistic in the world of anime: After Story doesn't seem like it's using a medium with fantasy elements only to escape reality. It takes life as it is and, overlooking a few contrived missteps, shows how the characters change the existing reality for themselves while being inextricably tied to it. Tomoya even considers running away from his problems by leaving the city with Nagisa (metaphorically escaping almost everything about his reality), but she reasons with him about the family he has in the city.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I found myself quite able to interpret the story in my own way. Outside of the humor and occasional filler, there are many important moments available for reflection. This appreciation for stillness and reflection (even occasionally outside of slice of life), I think, is the strongest argument for why anime is a medium and not a genre, and why it appeals to certain types of people more than others. One of my highlights in the first season was Tomoyo's conversation at sunset with Tomoya, where they theorized about 'family'. The essence of 'family' further explored by After Story is complex and multithreaded, and remains the defining question and legacy of the whole series. If you personally identify with the series, the questions raised by the series may remain a part of your everyday reality no matter what stage of life you are in. They may even cause you to think about everyone else in your life in new ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of the series was the strongest aspect for me, both in After Story and the first series. It opened my mind up through emotions to consider the realities and struggles of the different characters. Consider all of the scenarios presented in the first season. What must life be like for Kotomi, studying all alone in the library those long hours, living a life completely different from the high schoolers around her? In the real world with degree inflation in Asia where university has become a safe haven for students who can't get jobs yet are quite intelligent, what will become of students like her? Will all her domain-specific scientific knowledge become obsolete thanks to databases and her inexperience with cutting-edge electronic equipment? Think about Tomoyo. In a world of big data and near-total destruction of privacy, there may be less chance to change who society believes you are. Think about Kyou's future role as providing familial comfort and understanding to all the primary schoolchildren who don't have a family life as both parents work long hours. Think about Nagisa's parents, who would have a tough or impossible time paying for Nagisa's college with their modest-income jobs after sacrificing their dream careers. Are such parents realistic in families of the future? And the future Yusukes in developed countries may need to sacrifice even more family time to their jobs to sustain services in societies with many retired seniors. On a level closer to the canon, how will changes in Nagisa and Tomoya's life impact the people and the city around them over the years? More abstractly, to what degree do changes in the family of the city affect the family of friends and actual families? In After Story, just as in the first season, the music encourages thoughtful, probing questions for imaginative types and shows how much change time can bring. Perhaps the music can become a part of your life as you associate a song with a certain time period. For me, \"To the Same Heights\" contains a wonderful mixture of hope, uncertainty, and wonder in facing the future.\\n\\n\r\nSome people will not enjoy this anime. The moe art style may seem unsuited to the depth of the storyline (although for me, it seems merely an extreme case of the wonderful juxtaposition of innocence and hope against harsh realities in a similar vein as Madoka vs Kyubey, Akane vs Makishima and Sibyl, or even Honoka, Umi, and Kotori in front of an empty theater). The story arc before episode 9 in After Story is not realistic. The drama may be too intense for them, and the everyday dialogue too melodramatic. Yet starting with episode 9, I think what follows is the finest piece of storytelling that will exist in anime for a very long time.\\n\\n\r\nTake all the happy and sad things and roll them up.

Why is this anime given such high ratings that it is ranked 8 on MAL's toplist and in the top 20 on almost all other anime fansite toplists. It's ok, you can click unhelpful now, I won't mind.\r\nThis anime is ranked higher than Spirited Away.\r\nI said I understand two times, yet it is really a mystery to me. Still I understand why people like this sort of thing, there are many fanboys and fangirls out there who wish they found that special no-personality, clumsy,sweet, IQ=fishstick person that's just right for them, but when people who I share anime preferences with and I think of as respected watchers of anime give this thing 9's and 10's then something is wrong, something is up, probably with me. There must be something I don't see in this, something great, something wonderful, something fabulous... yea I said fabulous. I can't find it, I have tried, same thing with the first season which I found slightly better than the second season, yet I have tried finding what makes this, apparently, one of the best anime ever made.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is ranked higher than NANA.\\n\\n\r\nThis is an average romance/drama sprinkled with some supernatural on top to me. I can not for my life understand how anyone, anyone at all can give this anime a higher rating, when it comes to characters, than let's say a 6... and that's stretching it. This is all I'm going to say as I'm sure everyone has seen this anime and can make up their own mind about how wonderfully awesome it is, the engrossing elaborate plot and storyboard, the wonderful screenplay that is oh so breathtaking and don't get me started on that main protagonist who is truly a masterpiece when it comes to personality, he really underwent some serious character development during this anime... yeah!\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is ranked higher than Welcome to the NHK!",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nClannad: After Story is one of the highest rated and most beloved anime to ever be created; it's as simple as that. Rarely will you find a more passionate and dedicated group of fans who genuinely believe that an anime \"changed their life\".  If that is the case, I am by no means trying to take that away from you; I would never tell someone that a show is meaningless if it legitimately meant something to them. However, I am going to be very harsh on this anime; I think I am very justified in giving it this rating. There are way,WAY too many perfect reviews for this series that refuse to acknowledge its flaws, so this review will focus primarily on the negatives of the series, even though there are many things that it does well. In other words: CLANNAD FANS, READ WITH CAUTION!\\n\\n\r\nMy main problem with the show is simply this: The first half of After Story is guilty of  going down the worst possible road that a shoujo anime can go down: the dreaded road of \"emotion porn\", and some of it is absolutely unbearable. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the term, \"emotion porn\" refers any story/storyarc in a form of media that is incredibly shallow and uses gratuitous amounts of melodrama  in order to get a cheap cry out of it's audience. \"Emotion Porn\" is directed at the emotionally immature and at those who are desperate for a cry, and unfortunately, After Story's first half is jam packed with it.\\n\\n\r\n\"How dare you!!!\", cried the Clannad fans.\\n\r\n\"There is nothing shallow about Clannad After Story!!! It's a masterpiece with tons of depth to it at ALL times!!!\" they continued.\\n\r\nWell, stereotypical Clannad fanboy/girl, I beg to differ:\\n\\n\r\nHow about After Story's humiliatingly bad portrayal of gang violence? Is that \"deep\"? Or how about its unnecessary focus on characters that aren't even in the second half of the anime and had no reason to be in season two to begin with? Is that not shallow? Perhaps it's the lack on any real chemistry or development between the only two characters that actually matter until very late in the show?\\n\r\nI will eventually get to the good part of the anime (the last third), but for now, lets get through my negatives:\\n\\n\r\nWhat do you think of when you hear the word \"gang\"? The Bloods? The Crips? The Pyros? Maybe the Mafia? What ever you think of, it should definitely involve brutal, merciless people. Basically, heartless thugs who  settle their differences with guns and deal in shady businesses such drug dealing. Clannad After Story offers, well.... a \"different\" take on gang violence. Apparently, in Clannad-world, gangs are just a bunch of dudes who hang out together, sometimes beat each other up, and then run crying to a teenage girl to patch up their wounds. Oh, and the best part? If you deliver a nice, heart-felt speech to them, they all stop fighting and start being friends with each other! Isn't that nice?\\n\\n\r\nOkay, honestly, who the hell could possibly take this arc seriously? Out of all the hilarious examples of Clannad, Kanon, and Air's horribly written, sappy melodrama, this one just might take the cake. THIS. IS. NOT. SAD. Only a complete sap who wants a mindless excuse to cry would be even slightly touched by this kind of emotion porn. Everything is exaggerated to be 10X more dramatic then it would be in real life, nothing about it is emotionally investing, and when you aren't laughing at how this crap is supposed to be sad, you will be bored out of your mind. Never have I seen such a laughable portrayal of something that is a real-life tragedy! Be prepared to deal with this for about 16 episodes before the show actually gets sad.\\n\\n\r\nContributing to the pointlessness and boredom of the first half of After Story: I give you the characters! There are only three characters that matter even slightly in the grand scheme of this anime: Tomoyo, Nagisa (oh god, we will get to her), and a someone I can't reveal due to spoilers (Nagisa's parents are plot devices more then they are characters). And guess what; NONE of them are focused on until about episode 12! The main characters are basically just bystanders or plot devices for story-arcs that revolve around pointless side characters that, as I mentioned before, aren't even in the second half of the anime! These side stories are pointless, forgotten by the plot right after they are completed, and do nothing but waste the time of the viewer.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\n\"Why the hell are the writers trying to develop characters only to write them out of the show?\" You might ask. To answer, they weren't trying to develop characters; they were just giving the viewers some classic Clannad emotion porn. The plot doesn't matter, the characters don't matter, all that matters is making the viewer cry in as cheap a way as possible. Emotionally mature people will see right through this. And as a consequence of ignoring the main characters for so long, there is no development between them what so ever until very late in the anime! After watching Clannad, you could start After Story at about episode 12 and miss nothing relevant, and that is NOT okay!\\n\\n\r\nOh, and that's not even mentioning that one of the only three important characters is an absolute JOKE! I thought they couldn't possibly be serious with this shit, but they certainly were. Ladies and Gentlemen, let me introduce you to Nagisa Furukawa; the anime girl who has single handedly re-written the term \"mary-sue\". They should just go ahead and change the name of the term to \"Furukawa\", because this is some unbelievable stuff right here. She is a shameless, misogynistic idealization of women to the extent of which I've never seen. She is kind, obedient, never questions anyone or anything, has stereotypical ambitions (having a family), and has no discernable personality what so ever. The only thing I can say about this character is that, well, she f*cking exists.  Nagisa Furukawa is the most one-dimensional character I've ever had the misfortune of watching; she's an embodiment of an unrealistic idealization of a \"perfect wife\" rather then a portrayal of a realistic human being, which works against the point of the entire anime. NAGISA FURUKAWA IS AN AWFUL CHARACTER. JUST INDESCRIBABLY AWFUL.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, now that the negatives are out of the way, here are the positives: The last few episodes of Clannad After Story are unique, well written, and offer an unspeakably rare take on high-school romance animes; \"what happens after high school?\" If Clannad has established anything up to this point, it is that Tomoya and Nagisa are in love with each other.  It is at this point that the writing of the show takes a direction it should have had from the start: realism. It abandons all the bullsh*t side stories, supernatural elements, and emotion porn (until it blows it all with a deus-ex machina ending, but I digress). It finally does what I was waiting 1 2/3 seasons for it to do; tell a legitimate tragedy with relatable, heart-wrenching, elements. To give you an idea of how sad and tragic the last few episodes of After Story are, consider that at this point, I saw no way this anime could save itself. I don't even know why I kept watching, I was just looking forward to it to being over. Then, suddenly, I was completely emotionally invested in the characters and the environment to the point that I came damn close to crying. When I say this anime gets sad, I mean it! It took way too long, but After Story eventually developed into a tragic story that simply captures how unfair life really is, and it really is beautiful.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nTo recap:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nThe last and only significant arc is a masterpiece, but the first half of the show is not cohesive and is unbearably sappy/boring for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nBeautiful animation. The settings all look fantastic, but the character designs really bother me. Like I mentioned with Kanon 2006, the female characters have heads that are like 50% eye! Anime characters all have big eyes, but this is ridiculous! It's kind of creepy\u2026\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nA decent opening and a good soundtrack, but it has the worst ending theme of any anime ever created. You will not understand why just by listening to it, but watch the show and you will see what I mean. The voice acting is pretty good in the sub, and it's pretty average in the dub.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nThe only important ones are not focused on nearly as much as they should be. All the pointless side characters spend so much time on screen in the first half of the show, and then they just leave at around the halfway point. I simply don't understand why that is considered okay. I like Tomoyo, but he is a bit bland at times. And Nagisa is AWFUL, as previously mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nOverall, Clannad After Story does not get criticized the way is deserves to. People romanticize about this show as if it is the second coming of Jesus Christ, but the truth is that it's simply unworthy of such lofty praise. Is it still worth a watch? Probably, but certainly not with the expectations of it being one of the greatest anime masterpieces of all time, because it simply isn't in my opinion. I understand the appeal, but it simply wasn't for me.",

            "content": "To be frank, I despised the first season with a passion. For the life of me I couldn\u2019t understand what was so great about it. Yet I still saw the fandom of Clannad everywhere; from the forums to it being favourited on every other profile. I promised to stay away from ~After Story~ after witnessing the fail or rather mediocrity of Clannad. However, seeing the rage of it rising faster and louder with it being currently ranked #1 on the site I caved. Like a kid being peer pressured into smoking I reluctantly watched it. And I\u2019m glad I did. \r\nThis is a continuation ofthe previous series and opens up with the conclusion of Clannad: That Nagisa and Tomoya has finally started dating. But by no means does it stop here. Not many anime, or any stories even, tell a story where the couple are already together and go off from there. Most of the time it\u2019s about how the two love interests get together and fall in love, which is all well and fine but what about after? Do they actually live happily ever after? Are their futures sure to be fine and dandy now that they are together?\\n\\n\r\nI never thought highly of \u2018slice of life\u2019 anime. If I wanted to watch an anime about people\u2019s lives I would just record myself, or better yet - watch Big Brother. Anime is all about the supernatural, fantasy, badass and beautiful characters, action, over the top romances and comedic situations -- the unreal! \\n\\n\r\nOr so I thought. \\n\\n\r\nClannad ~After Story~ proves you don\u2019t need any of these to make a great anime. There\u2019s no world destruction, huge responsibility, convenient coincidences, twists of fate, gore, blood, lovey-dovey romance or any of the usual routine. It\u2019s life. With heart-wrenching drama. With every day real life events that could happen to any of us. And with bittersweet moments.\\n\r\nIt does have some supernatural elements though, but if anything, it adds a touch of realism rather than the opposite. Who\u2019s to say these supernatural mysteries do not take place in real life after all?\\n\\n\r\nThe main cast remains the same, however unlike the first series, ~After Story~ concentrates more on Nagisa and Tomoya, especially in the second half of the series -- one of the many reasons why I enjoyed this. There are also many episodes which are dedicated to characters whom are important and dear to Tomoya and holds value in his life. I also found these a  great joy and equally inspiring. The quality of content in these episodes are much higher than those in the prequel series and of faster pace. They don\u2019t draw out one character\u2019s story for five episodes, but instead packs one or two episodes with such inspiring stories that moves a person emotionally. \\n\r\nThe series has a strong family theme, with Nagisa\u2019s parents being central characters in the story. Tomoya\u2019s father has a bigger part in this series, as we see a progression and revelation between Tomoya and his father. Rarely is there ever a family theme in anime. We hardly ever see parents being shown, never mind being main characters - they really do well in pulling off such a delicate theme. \\n\\n\r\nWhat really made the anime for me was the animation and sound. The animation was so surreal, so vivid it simply made me stare in awe. Key\u2019s animation really impressed me; at times they would they would do sweeping camera follow ups, follow the movement of a flying baseball in slow motion or even chase the movement of a little girl as she runs through a field. The sound was beautiful too. I usually never sit through every single episode\u2019s opening however I could never resist ~After Story\u2019s~ opening. It always sets the mood of the anime and prepares you for what\u2019s to come. Even the opening could twinge your feelings a little. The other themes were wonderful as well. It could go from happy, joyful tunes to melancholic, depressing ones to uplifting and inspirational instrumentals. Nagisa\u2019s Dango Song affected me the most as it would be soft and cute at first then go on to be so painfully uplifting with the use of percussions. \\n\\n\r\nAnother beautiful thing is Nagisa and Tomoya\u2019s relationship. Not once in the entire show are they shown to kiss and even holding hands was a rare see. Yet, their relationship is truly on another level. What they have is a bond so strong and pure that those sort of actions do not need to be shown to tell us that they are undeniably close.\\n\\n\r\nI disliked Clannad. This feeling I cannot change. But Clannad ~After Story~ is a whole other world in anime. It has the art of anime, but has the feel of an old time classic love story of happiness, tragedy and bittersweet revelations. I sought an anime that would make me cry. And sure enough it did. Even the most stone-hearted person would feel a heart aching twinge. Either that or bucket loads of tears. It\u2019s simply beautiful.",

            "content": "If a work of fiction drags its audience into the depths of hell with tragedy, does it retain its artistic merit if the entire experience is nullified by the conclusion?\r\nThis is the principal question faced when attempting to reach a verdict on Clannad: After Story, a work of fiction which has a compelling power to manipulate the emotions of its audience: to make them laugh, to bring them to tears, and to leave their hearts warm with joy. Exploring themes such as redemption and heartbreak, it does many of these things wonderfully, but in desperation to end with a certain tone, it destroys everything itachieves in a single moment.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Story is the continuation of the first series of Clannad, a harem anime which distinguished itself from its contemporaries by treating its subject tactfully and managing to be amusing along the way. This is largely because of the strength of the main protagonist Tomoya Okazaki. In a genre which is infamous for bland main characters with no purpose other than being a body the audience can insert themselves into, Okazaki is a breath of fresh air. He had a back-story, a personality, and a sharp wit. That he spent so much time around women was not surprising, because his character was charismatic and interesting. His relationship with best friend Sunohara was also like a comedy double act, and was genuinely funny to watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe female cast, while based on familiar archetypes and not as strong characters as Okazaki, also had more depth than their contemporaries in the genre. They had their own interesting stories and subplots, and most of these were entertaining to watch. It was pretty clear from the offset that Okazaki would end up with Nagisa, and yet these diversions from the main storyline did not feel like distractions. Those characters were important to the story as a whole and their subplots helped to develop them. Afterstory takes things to another level. While the myriad of female characters are still present, it progresses from a harem story to a pure romance. Those female characters from the previous series are retained but they become less like groupies and more like a community. Their relationships with Okazaki and Nagisa are not just on good terms, but they behave like real friends. There is no underlying sense of competition among them for Tomoya\u2019s attention and they interact with the couple cordially.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the presentation in Afterstory is up to the high standards of the first series, with excellent animation and a quality soundtrack. While the art style is primarily a question of taste (though I question the legitimacy of the \u2018bug eye\u2019 critique) there is no doubt that the animation is consistently smooth and polished. It\u2019s not daring or experimental, but it is highly articulate. The soundtrack fits the series wonderfully too, tugging at your heart strings at the appropriate moment, and easing you into laughter when Okazaki and Sunohara are up to their antics. It never errs and even if the same melodies are used time and time again, they never feel repetitive, and they linger on in memory long after the series is over.\\n\\n\r\nIn short much of the original series\u2019 qualities are retained; the most striking difference between the two is the storyline, which in After Story develops into something far grander than its predecessor. While the first series of Clannad works as a piece of entertainment, in Afterstory the saga evolves into a work of art that explores complex themes, principally the theme of redemption. It does not do so with religious imagery or symbolism, but by masterfully crafting a story around the principle itself. Okazaki, as is known from the first series, is dealt a fairly bad hand early in life. Despite these difficulties he strives to help others and eventually manages to take some control of his existence and improve his situation. After Story does this without coming across as moralising or feeling contrived, a difficult task for a story with such themes.  The series also contains a fair amount of tragedy, and this executed masterfully. In one key scene, a blissful moment is thwarted suddenly, quickly spiralling downwards into sorrow. One cannot help but shed a tear for poor Tomoya, whom life had finally begun shining upon. The theme of redemption resurfaces later in the story, where it is played to even greater effect. After reaching a catastrophic low, Okazaki is eventually able to reconcile his relationship with a character he earlier abandoned, in a climactic and touching scene which frames the rest of the series beautifully. This scene is balanced perfectly with the tragic scene mentioned earlier, and the emotional swing between misery and bliss leaves the audience with a feeling bittersweet happiness that every work of fiction strives to instil in its audience accomplished with finesse. Then, in front of our eyes, the beauty of everything before us unravels into something unspeakably ugly.\\n\\n\r\n In a decision which can only be described as madness, the story incorporates another tragedy into the storyline- one which serves no greater artistic purpose or develops Okazaki\u2019s character further. It is merely a tragedy for tragedy\u2019s sake. And at that point, After Story enters into the void of sentimentality and emotional exploitation. One cannot empathise any further with the characters or feel any sorrow. In fact, the most appropriate response is anger. Anger that creating something interesting or making any kind of statement was never the intention of the creators, only to toy with our emotions in the hope it would provide us with some kind of masochistic pleasure. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIt is a plot development from which no story could recover; any meaning one had found in the story until that point is completely lost, and we find ourselves unable to care in the slightest what else might happen to Okazaki. It is perhaps only the desire to get the damned thing over with that compels us to continue with the rest of the series. But continuing the series is an even greater mistake, because the rest of the story serves no purpose other than to add insult to injury.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the second tragedy is nothing more than emotional blackmail, we could say that at least it doesn\u2019t betray the emotions we had felt prior to it. To end on another low point seems meaningless but one still has the beautiful journey reaching it to reflect upon and the opportunity to ponder over its significance. One could satisfy oneself with the fact that while the narrative was obliterated, that such unfortunate double tragedies do occur and that the story is at least \u2018real\u2019. \\n\\n\r\nYet even this is desecrated by the conclusion, in which everything preceding it is rendered moot. We are inexplicably transported to a world where all the terrible events of the story do not occur and Okazaki is able to experience the happy life he had always longed for. This is completely unforgivable. \\n\\n\r\nIf you read any book on writing fiction, there will invariably be a chapter on \u2018bad endings\u2019 and the most prominent of these is \u2018it was all a dream\u2019. The reason being that such endings mean any inconsistencies do not need to be explained, that no real development occurs, and that anything that did occur is now meaningless. Afterstory\u2019s ending is more or less equivalent to this. As the story had been cohesive and logical until this point, it is unlikely they did so to cover up for any errors made previously or to escape any inconsistencies. Clannad\u2019s underlying supernatural themes go some way into explaining how the series ends the way it does, but does nothing to justify why it should end that way. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSuch an ending does have one use though, and that is making a happy ending possible despite the previous plot developments. But why do we necessarily need such a conclusion? There is an implicit point being made that the audience would be unable to cope with a sad ending, making it necessary to conjure a happy ending by any means, even at the expense of the rest of the story. This is nothing less than an insult to the intelligence of the viewer. It is disgraceful. To take the audience into their emotional depths under the pretence that there will be a message or something meaningful behind it, only to betray their sense of empathy by providing an escape no-one who faces such tragedies in the real world shall ever have. Such abuse of emotions in works of fiction can only cause harm. It only leads one to refrain from investing too much feeling into fictional characters, making them hesitant to do so in the future. Worse still, while the audience is able to take in the sadness of the situation the characters experience, the opportunity for contemplation of its wider significance is severed. The consequences mean nothing because the problem has ceased to be a problem.\\n\\n\r\nIn works of fiction, the conclusions you reach are not as important as the journey taken to reach them, since the journey itself is what should lead one to reach those conclusions. In the case of Clannad Afterstory this process has been, not even reversed, but completely ignored. There is no connection between the two events. The journey exists, and it is a wonderful experience. It exhibits a kaleidoscope of human emotions on a powerful level, and does so beautifully. But that journey has no bearing on the conclusions reached either by the plot, or in the mind of the audience.  \\n\\n\r\nHence the dilemma posed in reaching a verdict on this series. Does one simply praise the series for what it does well, criticise its faults and attempt to find a balance between the two? This is the approach one would usually take, but when the conclusion is not only disconnected from the journey but contradicts it entirely, that is something which cannot simply be forgotten. It obliterates all meaning, it excavates all depth, it makes the whole damned thing sum up to nought. Take your wish fulfilment and intellectual depravity if you wish, but I would rather be left in the depths of hell.",

            "content": "~After Story~ is an anime that touches people's souls. I watched it, and was blown away. This was just less than a year ago.\r\nI just spent the last 4 days re-watching Clannad and Clannad ~After Story~.\r\nIt made me recall that the first season was actually good. The first time I saw it, it just paled in comparison to the ending of After Story, giving me false memories of it being bad when I thought back to it.\r\nAfter Story was still even better. The second time through made me admire the pacing the script writers had to go through to achieve this amount of emotional connectionthat other movies and shows can only dream of achieving.\\n\\n\r\nIt took multiple revisions of the same plot until they achieved this precipice. It went through a visual story video game, a manga, and a movie, which I'm sure all went through many revisions of the plot themselves, until they carefully produced this gem of a masterpiece. That's the only thing I can call it. I can't say it's any lower than that. All the extra episodes that aren't necessarily vital to the plot are all needed. It's pacing. You can't attach to characters at such an emotional level in a short amount of time.\\n\\n\r\nI loved After Story. Even though re-watching something will never give me the same experience as the original time, it still was great. I look forward to 30 years in the future, when I probably have all forgotten part of the plot (though, no amount of time will ever make me forget the possibly life changing experience) that I re-watch it again.\\n\\n\r\nI've never experienced anything that touched me like this anime has. People have told me of all kinds of animes that were sad, like Grave of the Fireflies, and such. None of them affected me. I just laughed, and assumed maybe I didn't have a heart since I didn't find anything sad. I mean everything too. Never a movie, book, nor show ever make me feel pity for their real or fictional characters. Everything until Clannad ~After Story~. To be able to create something that can do this deserves a Masterpiece title, because nothing I have encountered has ever done it before.\\n\\n\r\nI also seriously doubt there will anything in a long time that will top After Story's presence. In fact, I doubt that it can ever even be rivaled as an equal in terms of character development.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is simply amazing. If you actually pay attention to some scenes, you'll notice the very high quality background scenery, along with very fluid character animations with great shadow detail.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also one of the strongest points of the anime. The music is amazing and creates the atmosphere in numerous scenes. The ONLY thing I don't like is the happy, cheerful ending song. It only fits a handful of episodes, and completely destroys all mood created in the other episodes. If anything, they should have brought back the Ending of the 1st season for certain episodes. They have songs for everything, for all occasions.\\n\\n\r\nTo say this anime isn't a 10 makes me question someone's soul. Though, I can possibly understand why they might give it a 8 or 9, since everyone is different. Though to give it anything less is probably a troll attempt, or they just didn't finish the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is fantastic. It's not a brain twisting mystery, nor a plot twist filled thrill ride. It instead shows the roots of human mentality. It shows how a person develops.\\n\\n\r\nClannad ~After Story~ is not an anime you should skip on. I watched the anime through a 2nd time with a friend, since he had not seen it before. Mistake. This is best viewed by yourself, or possibly a loved one. Not a buddy.",

            "content": "Clannad ~After Story~ Review\r\nFIRST: Do NOT watch this show or read my review without first watching season one of Clannad. Although it isn't \"necessary,\" watching season one and experiencing the character development throughout it greatly helps you understand the story and value the characters. Plus, it was a pretty damn good show.\r\nStory-10:\r\nReally, the first 8 episodes of After Story are pretty much exactly like what the original Clannad series was like: school life and character arcs while slowly building up Nagisa and Tomoya's relationship. Although these arcs were well written and I enjoyed them thouroughly, they weren't deserving of a 10 rating. However, once youget past the great, but not truly spectacular first 8 eps, the show starts to focus solely on Tomoya and Nagisa. This is where the magic happens and the show began to become my favorite of all time. I was impressed that Clannad managed to make me cry during Fuko's arc (last time I cried was when my grandfather died a few years ago, and that was only a couple tears). But then in the homestretch of Clannad ~After Story~ I found myself bawling my eyes out on numerous occasions. The best word to describe this series is an emotional rollercoaster. It will having you laughing your ass off one minute, and crying like a baby the next. The writing in this anime is unbelievable and it's like the writers developed the perfect bow to pull on your heart strings, timing each event perfectly. The ending is controversial, but I personally loved it.\\n\\n\r\nArt-8:\\n\r\nThe art in After Story is beautiful. The settings are all beautiful, characters look great, and colors are vibrant. However, it is not up to par with some other, more recent, anime I have seen. If I were to review this back when it first came out, the art would get probably a 9, but with anime becoming more visually impressive each year, I just can't say it's distinctively good. It certainly is great though, and besides the fact that many of the characters don't seem to age physically even thou they are old (look the the furikawa family...), there is nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10:\\n\r\nI'm reviewing the dubbed version if anyone is wondering. I found the voice acting to be superb, and can't find any week links in the cast. But what really makes the sound of this anime spectacular is the soundtrack. My only complaint is with the Ed \"Torch\" although it isn't a bad song, it is very upbeat and poppy, thus can easily kill the mood of the more serious episodes if you don't pause the show before the song starts. Overall, most of the tracks used in Clannad are reused in After Story. All the music is perfectly placed with each scene, and i never found myself annoyed with the song choices. Each track helps establish the setting and mood of the scene. By now, everyone should be familiar with the dango song, and thus Nagisas theme. The melody to those songs was stuck in my head since season one. I found it to be a really cute and catchy song. But after watching After Story, I can't help but feel emotional whenever I hear it. The melody is rearranged multiple times to make different variations of the song that fit their specific scenes perfectly. Really, if the only songs in the ost were rearrangements of Nagisas theme, I would still probably give the soundtrack an 8. It really is quite like the series as a whole, sometimes listening to it will make you smile, but other times it may make you tear up a bit. Other highlights are Roaring Tides, The Place Where Wishes Come True, Toki o Kizamu Uta, and Fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10:\\n\r\nTHE reason why this show is so great. Each character is unique, and although their arcs can sometimes fall into a cliche, the writing still keeps you caring about them. The character development of Tomoya is really the most intriguing aspect. How he deals with all the joys and hardships of life really makes you think about yourself as a person. Where Tomoya was a funny delinquent in Clannad, in After Story you see him mature into an adult, albeit, an adult with a cursed life. I have never been a sucker for romance, but Tomoya and Nagisa's relationship is unlike any I've ever seen. The writers did a brilliant job of making you fall in love with the characters, and feel their emotions as they experience them. I know that what I just wrote isnt very convincing, but that's because I honestly can't explain how this show makes you feel for the lead characters because it is unlike anything I have ever experienced.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10:\\n\r\nThe show made me laugh until my stomach hurt on numerous occasions. It later would flip my stomach upside down and make me depressed as I cried my eyes out. The few plot twists this show has hit you hard (I was spoiled for one of the key events already, and it still left me shocked when it happened). Btw, for your own good: DO NOT GOOGLE ANYTHING ON CLANNAD WHILE WATCHING THIS SHOW. Seriously, just typing in a characters name and looking at the suggestions on google or youtube can spoil major plot events. So now you have been warned. Anyways, this anime is the first to make me actually think about myself as a person, and my future life. The emotional ride the show takes you on is one you will never forget.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nWatch this show. If you haven't already, watch Clannad before Clannad ~After Story~. In short, the emotions this show makes you feel are what set it apart from everything else. This show really can't be described in any other way than by watching it. If you don't think you can handle the emotions that come with this show, do not watch it. But if your someone who thinks anime is meant for action , and not something that can make you laugh, cry, and reflect on your own life, then watch this show, and see your perspective change completely. I have never seen anything like Clannad and After Story, and don't expect to ever again.\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\\n\r\nAn experience unlike anything I've ever seen. An emotional rollercoaster like no other.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Toying with your emotions\\n\r\n+ Excellent character development\\n\r\n+ Beautiful story\\n\r\n+ Music is fantastic\\n\r\n+ So much crying...\\n\r\n+ Everything else\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Torch can really kill the mood\\n\r\n- Not enough cons for me to write about\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Clannad, watch...\\n\r\nKanon/Air/Angel Beats:\\n\r\nAnything by Jun Maeda belongs here because they are so emotional and high in the drama department. Although none of these shows are as good as Clannad, they all do have similar feels and are all good in their own right.\\n\r\nef-Tale of Memories:\\n\r\nDrama filled sadness.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 - Masterpiece",

            "content": "Clannad caught me off guard last year being incredibly different from its predecessors, Air and Kanon 2006. There wasn't so much focus on a story as there was just following the school life of main characters Nagisa and Tomoya, as well as all their friends. When Clannad ended, Clannad After Story was announced. After Story not only guarantees its like its predecessors, but does so in a way that almost makes it excessive and, in the end, shameful. Though this may be the case, After Story is still a superior follow-up to the first season, following a more structured storyline, deepening characters, and still portrayingthat fabulous art and music Key adaptations by KyoAni have become renowned for.\\n\\n\r\nLike the first season, Clannad After Story still showcases the same brilliant art and music. Here we can see KyoAni has realy grasped a hold of their Key-style character designs, having come a long way from when they did Air back in 2005. The designs are aesthetically pleasing while still being a very enhanced degree of cute. The backgrounds, likewise, are very detailed though not meticulously enough that it would come off as gaudy. The town looks like an actual town, with construction sites and familiar pathways, which is excellent as the town itself is a key theme to the story.\\n\\n\r\nMusic provided from the game's original score continues to fit every scene perfectly, and vocal performance quality has skyrocketed with the growing characterization of Nagisa and Tomoya. Akio and Sanae are also well-cast and add to a good lot of scenes and episodes. Unfortunately, this second season has a penchant for insert songs, especially when they're not really called for. In addition, the ending theme \"Torch\" is wholly inappropriate for the gross amount of the episodes. Clannad After Story does top the previous season in making the opening theme even better, a very moving piece, \"Toki wo Kizamu Uta\" sung by Lia, who also sang the OP for Air TV. The accompanying graphics to the opening sequence only heighten the emotional value of the lyrics and the melody. It's easily one of After Story's more notable features.\\n\\n\r\nWith a more emotional opening though, comes a more emotional story. After Story begins by moving beyond the main characters to focus on arcs for smaller roles. These short arcs are actually just as moving as the longer arcs of the first season, providing a surprisingly hefty amount of character development from what were previously background characters and actually invoking a connection to them, which I really have to applaud this series for. Plus, these mini-arcs  buffer well into the main part of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual After Story itself, when it's finally reached, is quite possibly one of the most well-written and developed arcs of any anime I have ever seen. The story moves to a more linear format, focusing on Nagisa and Tomoya. For two characters who got the shaft for development in the first season, they get their development here and in spades. I dare say Tomoya may be the most multi-faceted harem male to ever grace anime.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode flows smoothly into the next in a very consistent format, and every episode brings a new turn or twist, sad or happy, but always dramatic and leaving you wanting more... that is until the last two episodes of the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nIn this final stretch, After Story hits the wall. Following several episodes of dramatic, moving, top-tier material, the storyline, dialogue and characterization all take a major downturn in the form of an unresolved loose end that has followed the series from the start. It feels so incredibly forced when its resolved, and takes away everything gained from the previous episodes, that it feels like a sucker punch both when they tie it up and in how they do it. This is only emphasized by the fact that they had two whole episode spaces to explain the story, but instead decided to end it with a non-consequential side story and a recap.\\n\\n\r\nAs the old saying goes, its not about the destination but the journey. The destination has left a very sour taste in my mouth, leaving me to reflect on how some of Key/Visual Art's more signature elements have only hindered this otherwise phenomenal slice-of-life romance, but it should not discredit from the phenomenal work that the rest of this series was. Trust me, it's worth the ride to swallow the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Clannad After Story gets a 9 out of 10.\\n",

            "content": "So it has finally come to this. As I'd watched this anime I felt compelled to review it, heck I've done it in my head many times over. Every time I had a new thought, realization that made it greater in my mind. The reason for doing this is most likely that Clannad succeeded in amplifying every single story arc, making it feel grand, perfect and complete. It was around halfway into After Story that I'd realized I am in way over my head. This does not deserve to be dissected and reviewed like some faulty piece of garbage. No sir.\r\nClannad has grown on memore than I ever thought possible when I played that first episode. Sakura trees, overdramatic (though fabulous) music, deep thoughts, cynical male protagonist right at the start of the anime? I knew it was really popular and loved, but back then I thought I knew just why and my presumptions weren't bright at all.\\n\r\n\"I realize why some people might like this stuff but me? Nah...this is too corny for me...oh well, now that I've started, I'll give it a shot with a few more episodes.\"\\n\r\nBut how the hell could I have known?\\n\\n\r\nIt's a 10, the biggest freakin' 10 I've ever given to anything in my entire life. This is what animes are basically all about. Granted, there are animes that are different, unusual and branch out pretty far from their origin. But essentially what makes them anime, not cartoons or tv shows, a medium that has attracted so many people lately is more or less the same. And Clannad is a conventional anime in that regard. Except it took all that emotion, tranquil slice-of-lifeness, seemingly naive but in fact deep story and made it feel REAL. Every character, every moment, everything that might have put me off at first - though it seemed bland at times - has converted into a great memory, a profound feeling of love. Clannad has stripped off the defense mechanisms I have implanted into my brain as I grew up, thinking I have toughened up, grown smarter, more experienced, when in reality all I did was block off those simple, yet beautiful things and emotions that make life. Because it was easier that way, it left me less vulnerable, rid of any great expectations, making it harder for me to get hurt.\\n\\n\r\nFriendship, falling-in-love, the simple quirks and talents that make us special, the dreams of our childhood and adolescence, all that seems to be labeled as a stupid ideal or taboo today. Should we trivialize those things, take them for granted and treat those moments as such? (This is exactly what Ryou was talking about in Kyou's arc, Alernate World episode) No, instead we should hold them as precious memories, even though they might not be \"Clannad\" for everyone. I was a bit like Nagisa in those years and I regret what I have missed. When I think about it, those years will always hold a special place in my heart even though my childhood and adolescence was short of practically any happy moments. If I had a chance to redo things, I definitely would have acted more like Tomoya, I would've stayed true to some things even when I was ridiculed and insulted by others.\\n\\n\r\nClannad is all too simple. If I tried to describe it, I certainly wouldn't do it any justice. Every aspect of it is combined in a perfect way to create a masterpiece, making it all seem believable. I cried plenty of times, I smiled like I haven't since childhood (I mean those truly happy, altruistic, empathic smiles) because the characters felt completely real. No real way to describe it other than watch it; this is what makes animes great - to an outsider all this would seem pathetic but rather than using complex dialogues or situations to build up characters and explain their morality like in the real movies or TV shows, in animes it's done in a way that's almost magical. Not only that, this anime makes you rethink your life priorities and thus changes it. Yes, this anime is life-changing.\\n\\n\r\nThere, my impression of Clannad. It's the best thing I've watched in my life. Rewatching an anime seemed like a ridiculous thing to do when there are so many good ones around, but I am positive I will rewatch Clannad one day and rejoice as I have on my first watching.",

And so they lived happily ever after\u2026\u201d\r\n\u201cAnd so they lived happily ever after\u2026\u201d\r\n\u201cEver after\u2026\u201d\r\n\u201cAfter\u2026\u201d\r\nWhat really happened to them \u201cafter\u201d? How long did they stay together? What happened to them when they were together?\r\nNo movie or show, let alone an anime, has ever answered these questions.\r\nUntil now.\r\nInstead of presenting a brief five minute epilogue with a J-ballad playing in the background at the end of the first season, Kyoto Animation has given us a 24 episode masterpiece, which is not only a highly satisfactory epilogue, but also a heart wrenching story by itself.\r\nClannad: AS is adirect sequel to the first season, Clannad. Although Clannad: AS is extremely good just as a stand-alone, watching the prequel provides better understanding of their characters and their backgrounds. If you still want to go ahead and watch Clannad: AS directly (although I wouldn\u2019t), then I suggest you give the MAL synopsis for Clannad a quick read before heading onto this one. You follow, Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa, two people who who have vowed to spend their lives together. What you get is the \"after\" of their relationship from Clannad. \\n\\n\r\nClannad: After Story is split into two parts - the side-characters part and the main-characters part. It starts off with three arcs (which make up the first part of the series), lasting a total of eight episodes, dedicated to three of the first season\u2019s recurring characters \u2013 Sunohara, Misae and Yukine. Although these episodes seem to be fan service and lack depth compared to the rest of the series at first glance, they are not. They are there for a purpose and that is to provide us with the characters\u2019 final days in school. Because in this anime, just like real life, their friends move on and the plot provides its absolute and undivided attention to probably my favorite on-screen couple of all time \u2013 Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa.\\n\\n\r\nYou get a visual running commentary of every single event of this seemingly perfect couple, as they struggle, hobble and claw at life to remain together. What you get is the complete journal of events that happen in this couple\u2019s lives, told from Tomoya\u2019s point of view. \\n\\n\r\nYou watch as he tries to overcome whatever life throws at him, in order to be happy, even for just a minute. \\n\r\nYou watch as he bears the brunt of life upon his shoulders and as he shifts through the yin and yang of life.\\n\r\nYou watch as his soul tries to escape the darkness that stalks him like his own shadow. \\n\r\nYou watch as he tries to understand the complexities of the world we live in, during the defining moments of his life.\\n\r\nYou watch, a boy becoming a man.\\n\\n\r\nI will try to condense the analysis of the animation and audio department so as to maximize the space available for story and character analysis.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is just as gorgeous as ever. Movements have been refined and are now much more fluid. The one thing that had improved majorly in this area was the art involved on the characters\u2019 faces. Their emotions are brought out so subtly, but yet so significantly, that it makes you wonder how long they spent trying to get these tiny factors right. For example, when you see Okazaki being calmed down by Nagisa, you can actually watch how his reactions slowly transform from angry to annoyed to a calm state within a couple of seconds. Perfect.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the soundtrack does, there have been no major additions except for the OP and the ED. The OP, Toki wo Kizamu Uta, is one of the best there is and has cemented its position in my favorite OPs of all time at number four. The ED,Torch, is, for the most of the series, a complete misfit. Just when you are about to burst into tears after a devastating episode, the sight of a girl doing high knees followed by the rest of the characters moonwalking across the screen totally ruins the mood.Hard to believe that this inappropriate ED comes from the same singer of the incredible OP, Lia.\\n\\n\r\nCalling this anime an emotional rollercoaster might very well be the understatement of the year. Now, the best way to describe the story's impact is to describe my emotional reactions when I watched the anime. I am a 17 year old guy, with below average sensitivity. Never in my life have I ever shed a tear while watching a show or a move in the theater or on TV. But, this anime wiped the slate clean. I can say, without any regrets or feeling embarrassed that I cried while watching Clannad: AS.  This anime tugs at your heartstrings so hard, that it\u2019s almost inhumane not to tear up. Clannad: AS will rip your heart out and then mend it with sweet words of love and then rip it out again.  During some scenes, I could almost feel my heart crumble inside my chest. That is not to say that this anime contains only sadness. Just when the show pushes you so hard into the well, it pulls you back up just as fast. This series is just raw emotion packed in the form of animated characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe story continues its tie-ins between the real world and the Illusionary World and the supernatural aspect of it plays a much bigger role in Clannad: AS. I won't be going too deep into this as it contains too many spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are crafted to perfection. Thanks to the super job by the animation department, you are now able to completely feel all of the characters' thoughts and feelings, blurring the line between anime and reality. For almost the entire series, I felt exactly how Okazaki felt and thought how Okazaki thought. The innocent and simple way they think was also one of the reasons people love the characters so much. The characters, although grown up, were so gentle at heart. This content and caring way of living lays further emphasis on the purity of the two protagonists. I felt their pain, their sorrow, their despair, their happiness, their pleasures and their excitement. The characters made sure of that. One particular new character bowled me over with his/her charm. The introduction of this soulful, innocent and sincere character was one of the main reasons why I was so moved by this anime.The characters are what strengthened the anime and made a simple tale interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is very well done. The casting was perfect and none were out of place. It was all so believable. The entire cast deserves a standing ovation for their power packed performance. The subbing by StaticSubs Eclipse was very neat.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I write a review, I do my best to be unbiased. But sometimes, it's hard not to let your emotions flow when you see an anime that mixes the genres of slice of life, drama and romance so well, that I simply cannot emphasize enough on its ability to make full use of its potential and deliver a story that is sure to make fans of any genre fall in love with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Clannad: After Story is a piece of art and will go down in history as one of the best ever. Even with a near-perfect ending, you\u2019ll be wishing for an After Story to this After Story as it\u2019s really hard to let to let go of the characters that you\u2019ve come to love so much. That\u2019s how hard-hitting and beautiful this anime is. The MAL rating of 10 does not mean an anime is perfect, but it means that the anime is a masterpiece. And that, Clannad: After Story is.\\n\\n\r\n[ THE WRAP-UP ]\\n\r\nClannad: After Story is a an intricately carved insight into the life of characters whose stories \u201cended\u201d last season. The trials and tribulations of the characters successfully bring your emotions to the surface. This emotional bond is further strengthened with a heartbreaking, yet uplifting story, which is guaranteed to drop to your knees and make you jump for joy at the same time. The anime infuses the key elements of its genres (romance, drama, slice of life) and serves a dish that is bound to please even the most stringent of otaku. The animation and soundtrack are exactly what you would expect from KyoAni - inch perfect. While the initial episodes might cause an eyebrow or to raise, rest assured, all suspicions are laid to rest once the series settles down about quarter of the series in. And from then on, the atmosphere of this anime is simply enchanting. This is just one of those rare anime out there that you don't want to miss out on, even if you're not a fan of the genre. Clannad: After Story is a magical journey that will leave you with a lot of memories which will leave you wondering on how YOUR After Story would be.",

            "content": "Magical, one of a kind beauty, executed and told in the most emotional way. Extremely unique and fascinating character development lead through life with its ups and downs. Realistic and tragic tale of love, life and living. A story which has lot to say and even more to offer. Life goes on, people change, but some things always stay the same. Or.. do they?\r\nWhen I first watched Clannad, I thought it was a dull harem which had nothing spectacular to say. When I watched Clannad After Story, I thought it would offer the same dull nothing which Clannad was all about. This actually happened, butonly for a short period of time. Soon after the start, Clannad After Story made some tragic acts and took a different route, completely new and fresh route. This route started a story which would never be forgotten. A story which would burn into the minds of all the people who end up watching the series. The mark it would leave would be a very positive and warm which would be treasured by majority of its viewers. But, in the same time, there would be people who would absolutely hate it and bear a great hatred towards the series and people who made it. \\n\\n\r\nDuring the run, Clannad After Story becomes very realistic. So realistic that it is closer to truth than anything, and the truth is something we can't handle, so we get to see something else instead. A conclusion where the world is something \"better\" and far more \"good\" than what people would expect from reality. A conclusion which makes Clannad After Story a series which gives absolutely no value to the dead nor those who have dealt with the death of someone close. The ending is the prefect way to ruin one of the most impactful series possible, and change ones views about the series completely. It's an immature wish fulfillment ending which is executed solely because of viewers preferences for happiness. This unneeded happy ending destroyes everything the series itself managed to accomplish, but only in terms of the fiction, and not in terms of already experienced emotions, which is why majority of people can keep calling Clannad After Story a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of people saying that Clannad After Story is the most perfect anime out there. World changing and life changing series which determinates ones humanity and shows how good of a person they are. This is ridiculous. What I, and majority of people seem to get of Clannad After Story, is that there is definitely good people in the world. This is where I stop. After that becomes the conclusion that good stuff happen to good people. There are miracles in the world and these miracles happen and make people happy. What Clannad After Story really makes is not a miracle, it is a cop-out with a lot of foreseeing. One very popular topic about the ending is the use of deus ex machina, which frankly, doesn't even matter. The trope used there is irrelevant since tropes aren't defining quality. The ending is nothing but a second change given in a situation where you don't fucking need a second change. You are supposed to live like the rest of us, not to fucking miraculously get back the things that can't be gotten back. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, I loved Clannad After Story, and that's why I hate it.",

Some very minor spoilers might be unavoidable too.\r\n- - -\r\nThe mighty Clannad After Story. One of the most highly praised anime in existence. Is it worth the praise? Is it really that good? No.\r\nI've heard that this anime is of the highest quality with one of the most heartbreaking stories ever written. Hahaha, no. There are so many problems with this anime that the bad overshines the few goods.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nJust like the first season, the first half of the second season tried too hard to forceemotions with pointless arcs that served no use for the second half, where the main part of the story was. It was still a bad mash up of romance, drama, slice-of-life, and comedy. It still didn't know what it was trying to be until the second half where the story finally started going in a clear direction. But a lot of problems came out of this too. Mainly Nagisa (more detail in the character section). After it started going in this direction, it was just boring until the final arc. The last arc is by far the best part of the show. But then they pulled the worst bullshit with the last episode. I know it was kind of built up throughout the show with those balls of light, but it literally rendered the entire season pointless. The final episode was something they cranked out of their asshole at the last second in an attempt to make everything good and dandy. A good last arc ruined.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nIt was definitely an improvement from the first season, but I still couldn't take any of the girl characters seriously with the stupid fucking bug eyes. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nIt was okay.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nIn the first season, over half of the cast was filled with useless one dimensional characters. But there were some good ones. Half way through season two, all of the likeable side characters were gone. The only characters left were Nagisa and Okazaki. I hate Nagisa with a passion. She's a terrible, one-dimensional, annoying character that completely detached me emotionally from the story. I literally stopped thinking of her as a person as some point. Okazaki, however, had pretty good character development and I actually had some emotional connection to his problems. But, I felt whatever potential the show had as a drama was completely ruined by Nagisa. She literally made me not care. Nagisa's parents were the only other relevant characters (until the last arc) and are pretty good characters but they were there more to progress/extend the plot than anything to actually be characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (Huge Spoiler here): 4/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed the first half as much as the first season of Clannad, so not that much. I was bored until the last arc. There was one part where I was seriously sad in the story: I noticed that the art was  better so I googled \"Nagisa's eyes\" to compare the horrendous eyes of the first season to the second to see if they were any better (I didn't know whether they were or whether I was just getting used to them) and the search came up with a youtube video titled \"Nagisa Died.\" I was mad and upset because now I wouldn't be as happy when I saw Nagisa in the anime. Oh, I stilled cheered when the moment came, but not as much as I would've liked to. But let me tell you, I'm very glad she died. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\n-Pointless first half, same problems as first season\\n\r\n-Boring until last arc\\n\r\n-God awful final episode\\n\r\n-Nagisa\\n\r\n-Most likeable characters were gone\\n\\n\r\n+Good last arc\\n\r\n+Nagisa died\\n\r\n+Okazaki's character development\\n",

The anime often heard in my ear as one of the best anime. I always ask myself, ''Why? Why Clannad very famous? Is it really that good?\". But now, I know something special is exist in this story.\r\nIf you looked Clannad AS, there is not much to say about the plot. It told us a tale of a man that suffer the difficulties of living, and how he pass through it.In the early episode, the storytelling almost looks same like the first season described as not too essential.  But after that, the story run into one focused and unique storytelling.One of the other major fruitfulness is the story managed to wrap all of the mixed feelings that are not rigid and suitable with the story.  There are various moral lessons we can learn, one of them is  \"even though you've had a painful past, you can overcome it by looking into the future with the ones you love\", and many moral lessons includes in this story, it is the most powerful aspect of the story. The pacing it's relatively slow but fit with this kind of settings. Next, the ending, the most widely criticized part of Clannad After Story is its deus ex machina ending, it still abstract to understandable if the viewers don't understand the mysteries that lurked, which can bring a little bit confusion to the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is wonderful, set in a beautiful world, have a great background details and colorful art. Although I know there is many people disliked the character big eyes design, but it really needs praise for the breathtaking environment. The sound settings are well-matched with the feeling of the story, the OP theme song \"Toki wo Kizamu Uta (\u6642\u3092\u523b\u3080\u5504)\" by Lia really represents the expression of the story. The seiyuu did a wonderful job in bringing such character to the screen.\\n\\n\r\nI almost shocked and silent, It's just so perfect & unmatchable. The main character grows to more mature. Every character has their proper development & plays their roles well. There is a process and the results come. It is one of the deepest and detail character development I ever saw. \\n\\n\r\nThere goes Clannad After Story, a story that made almost all of its audience draw their tears in their eyes. If you looking an anime that succeeds both in their perfect character development and deep plot, Clannad After Story is the answer. \\n\\n",

Okazaki and Nagisa went one way, and all of their fellow classmates soon depart another. Whether you were a Nagisa fan from the beginning or not the story almost twists you into having a bit of sympathy in the least, and I feel if a writer is able to do something like that, then round up the applauses because damn am I impressed! \\n\\n\r\nIt's a vast universe, when you lock souls with that other, it almost seems like a miracle. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 - From the unique visuals used for the toy robot and the Illusionary girl, to the mere fluidity in Tomoyo's 1,000 kick combo! I have never been less than impressed when it comes to a Key production. The opening songs are beautiful in both art and sound and I can't get enough of the foreshadowing. Kyoto's visual arts know when to emphasize a scene of significance; the baseball soaring through the air, it turns into a close-up, spinning ever so slowly, and then we return to the story of the Illusionary girl, and the field which constantly emits these orbs of light, floating, as if the world they're in, has it's own sort of weather. The atmosphere of Clannad is what pulls one into the anime, almost like you're experiencing it all as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 - Again, the opening songs for the prequel and Clannad AS itself were both very pleasing to the ears, but had a kind of melancholic tone, this only grows stronger as you progress through the series because you then are able to reflect on all the characters as you see the images pass by. The sound effects for everything else aren't much to write home about but the soundtrack is quite amazing! The synchronization of the bgm and the scene at hand could be the reason you find yourself bawling or tearing up on the side because of how heavy it all feels at once. I have no words for how sad one single soundtrack could make you feel. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10 - The idiot, the genius, the tsundere, the tomboy, the shy girl, the airhead, the goofball. All of these generic characters in one show, but how do they manage to be so entertaining and get them spot-on? Because it's just done well, and isn't boring, or frustrating and repititive. The characters mingle with each other like how they're suppose to and nothing seems out of place, or unordinary. Aside from Fuko. Now that relationships have developed and it's almost time for graduation, the 'friends' almost seem like a family. \\n\\n\r\nDango Dai kazoku!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 - Never will I forget such a series, and I will continue to recommend it as long as I keep interest in anime, and I don't plan on abandoning it anytime soon. Let's hope it sticks, but Clannad can and WILL teach you a few things about life, it isn't easy but miracles do happen, so don't let go of that strand of hope, and keep on pushing for what it is you seek. It'll all be worth it! Just like an alternate world, there are always alternative options, don't fret, keep your eyes on the prize! As they say.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I laughed...\r\nI cried...\r\nI experienced something that changed my life... \r\nIn a nutshell, Clannad ~After Story~ influenced the way I will live for the rest of my life and not just in some half-assed way like any other show would. It legitimately moved me to make certain decisions, for better or for worse. In that sense, no other anime can compare, as no other anime has provided an equivalent reaction on my part.\r\nBefore you continue, you should know that Clannad ~After Story~ is a continuation of the story from Clannad and an adaptation from the original Visual Novel by KEY. Although knowledge of the first seasonis not necessary, it is highly recommended if you want to get the most out of ~After Story~ as well as this review. That being said, this review is tailored to all readers, and can be understood without knowledge of the first season. Note that there may be very minor spoilers. Now then, on to the meat and potatoes.\\n\\n\r\nI won't spend much time on the individual components of Clannad ~After Story~ (or Clannad ~AS~ as I will call it now) like I have with my other reviews. At first glance, there is nothing notably outstanding about it as a whole. For those who are interested in the individual components, here they are and the reasons behind them are available at the end of the review:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8.7/10\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 8.4/10\\n\r\nSound: 7.8/10\\n\r\nCharacter: 9.7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment (in this case influence): 10+/10 \\n\r\nOverall: 9.8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\n| Main Review |\\n\r\nIt is difficult to convey the emotions that went through my mind as I watched Clannad ~AS~. For those of you who watched the first season and dropped the show, I urge you to pick up ~AS~ and give it a chance. The first few episodes run almost identically to those of the first season, but the true After Story part branches off in a manner that is unique only to ~AS~. What Clannad ~AS~ gives the viewer is a story of life. A story of despair. A story of forgiveness. A story of hope. Through this story, Clannad ~AS~ can powerfully change the way you perceive the world around you. I am well aware that not everyone enjoys Clannad and ~AS~, especially since the magical light orbs are outlandish to some, but for me it was a bit of a godsend among anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of Clannad ~AS~ is neither truly unique nor breathtakingly wonderful. What the viewer gets when watching it is the story of a man. Nothing less and nothing more. What Clannad ~AS~ really excels at, however, is the way it tells the story of that man. While it may be classified as a romance or even a harem anime by some (at least the first season could be), I really classify Clannad ~AS~ as a slice of life. A slice out of the life of a delinquent who can\u2019t seem to do anything right and struggles to protect what really matters to him as the world comes crashing down.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, \u201cslice of life\u201d can be a deceptive term. As I watched Clannad ~AS~, it was not as much a slice out of Tomoya\u2019s life but a slice out of mine. You see, what Kyoani succeeds in is hitting on the points that make life truly what it is. The continuation of time. The reality of truth. The genuine meaning of \u201clife goes on.\u201d Additionally, by extending over many years, the true significance of every event begins to emerge. Clannad ~AS~ takes the tale of the first season and shapes it around a single person. It is a respectable reflection of life and delves into what many shows do not, and cannot, represent: the story after the story. \\n\\n\r\nWhile many of the situations may be overblown and excessively dramatized (at least in the opinion of some people), it is ultimately true that every facet of Clannad ~AS~ gives the audience some insight into life. Does it matter that there are miracles and magic orbs of light flying around? For me, no. For others, this could be the case. That is to say, not all aspects of Clannad ~AS~ are perfect, but the impact was enough for me. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a cheerful anime, turn away now. Kyoto Animation does many things with Clannad ~AS~ including some very effective humor in many places, but Clannad ~AS~ will make you cry and smile, often both in the same episode. I won\u2019t lie, I cried at least 5 times throughout the season. Even when rewatching episodes, I cried again. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Clannad ~AS~ really has some happy moments as well, but Kyoani tends to depress many, many times. Each sad moment is profound and beautiful, but nevertheless it is sad. The ending song, Torch, which is played in every episode, serves to alleviate this, for better or worse. Torch is very upbeat, but many people consider it unnecessary and I agree. Torch can be a real mood breaker at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe power that Clannad ~AS~ exerts comes from its characters. While the first season portrayed many main characters and their stories, ~AS~ focuses on the life of Tomoya and lightly on the lives of those who surround him. Tomoya is a failure in a cruel world. In a sense, he is a fatal hero. While he may not know it, he is destined to face pain and suffering through his life. There is a bit of controversy over the ending of ~AS~, but those who wish to have a \u201ctruer\u201d ending can consider the second to last episode as such (don\u2019t hate me for suggesting it). When seen in that light, Clannad ~AS~ effectively played out a story that neither catered to an audience nor skewed reality (except for the orbs of light, of course). What it presented was something that many people can relate to. The loss of a loved one. The pain of recovery. The neglect of a father. Rediscovering love and friendship. Coping with suffering. *SPOILER* The feeling of holding a daughter in your arms for the first time. The pains and joys of being a father. */SPOLER* What it ended with was a realistic ending and a message for the future. Additionally, if seen that way, the last episode can be portrayed as Kyoani staying true to the visual novel and respecting the source material.\\n\\n\r\n*Unfortunately, more talk of the plot would undeniably lead to spoilers, which I am trying to keep free from this review, so please bear with me. Heck, if I\u2019ve convinced you at this point, what are you waiting for? Go see for yourself what all the hype is about. Otherwise, read on!*\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, Clannad ~AS~ molded characters that I thought I was familiar with into something close to human. Their stories produced emotion that made me reconsider the situations of the people that I see every day. Through social commentary and moral struggles, the viewer can genuinely begin to respect Tomoya. I know I wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand half of what he did, but I truly began to respect the fact that he kept going, despite him being a fictional character. Through his struggles, I began to learn about myself. Through the struggles of those around him, I began to respect those whom I had once hated. This may seem extreme, and you may think that I am crazy, but what I write is nothing but the truth. Every episode gripped me, and many episodes evoked tearful reactions, which I am not very prone to. As I continued to watch, I could hardly bear waiting a week for each new episode to come out. At the same time, however, I knew that each episode held a bomb - a flood of emotions that could affect the rest of my day. Clannad ~AS~ went way beyond enjoyment \u2013 it went into the realm of what I could call an \u201cepiphany.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nCan the story of one man influence the lives of others? Is it still possible if that man is a fictional character? For me, I did not think it was possible for anime to extend its influence at such a level. Clannad ~AS~ proved me wrong time and time again. Look past the first season and the first few episodes, and perhaps you can begin to understand what I mean. \\n\\n\r\nFor those interested or who can relate after watching the show, this is the ultimate and most powerful result of the show as it applies to me. The following is the reason why I can\u2019t keep my mind off of Clannad ~AS~ and the reason why it will remain as my #1 favorite for what I know will be many, many seasons: *SPOILER* Through Clannad ~AS~, I have basically committed to wanting to have a baby. Ushio love. */SPOILER*\\n\\n\\n\r\n| Analysis of components |\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nClannad ~AS~ is unique in its storytelling, but the story itself is nothing special. The earlier episodes present almost unrelated stories just as the first season did, but Clannad ~AS~ takes a turn for the better with a focus on a single character and his ordeal. At this point, Clannad ~AS~ does nothing but follow the life of a young adult, Tomoya. Sure there is drama (oh, is there drama) and there is romance, in a sense, but in reality, there is no real plot to speak of. What there is, however, is the tale of a life experience that can change the way you live. A real deterrent might come from some of the magic that inexplicably finds its way into Clannad (both seasons), but that never really bothered me. The ending is also less-than-stellar and can be a bit confusing, but as stated before, there\u2019s always the second to last episode to fall back on.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nThere is nothing blatantly wrong with the animation quality. Kyoto Animation produced Clannad ~AS~, so fans will know that there is nothing to fear. The character design is the same as that of Clannad and other KEY adaptations. The KEY character design is quite distinguishable, with its giant eyes. Personally, I am a fan, but other viewers might dislike the artwork. Other than that, Kyoani did another solid job with the animation, and there are no jerky movements that detract from the gorgeous lessons that unfold.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nKyoani had its ups and downs with the music for Clannad ~AS~. In many aspects, Clannad ~AS~ shoots beyond other KEY adaptations with its unique, unconventional plotline and incredibly well enacted scenes of what could very well be the life of an individual. In fact, many of the ordeals that Tomoya must face strike a particularly strong emotional chord among many people. Who knows, you might not be that certain type of person, but I definitely was. Anyways\u2026 back to the music. Clannad ~AS~\u2019s opening sequence is a strong piano melody with deceptively deep lyrics. However, the ending sequence detracts from many of the spectacular moments, especially because Kyoani tends to end episodes on a sad note. As such, many would classify Torch (the ED) as an elaborate troll because it is too lively. Beyond the OP and ED, Clannad ~AS~ features tracks from the Visual Novel, which include very familiar tracks from the first season. Notable among these are the songs with lyrics, ie Ana. Certain parts of the OST mesh very well, and a powerful soundtrack can produce a powerful reaction. However, I don\u2019t remember anything in particular clearly standing out to me, and as previously mentioned, Torch ruined quite a few strong moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWhile most of the other aspects of Clannad ~AS~ are very similar to their counterparts in the first season, character development in ~AS~ take a turn for the better. Kyoani successfully made me hate characters that I loved and love characters that I hated. Through a roller coaster complete with dips and turns, Clannad ~AS~ changed the way I perceive all type of people. From Tomoya\u2019s seemingly disinterested, alcoholic father to Nagisa, a character who I actually deemed annoying in the first season, I came to understand what truly makes up a person. Every character really has a story behind their dejected or cheerful fa\u00e7ade. Despite the usual \u201cClannad magic,\u201d every character also turned out to be associable, adding to the personal level of the show. Even the more comical, secondary characters had their share of emotional moments, giving them real depth and giving the viewer a relatively accurate understanding of human nature. About half-way through the show, there is a certain character that changes many, many things. I won\u2019t spoil it now, but her unique appearance is what truly brought Clannad ~AS~ to unmatchable levels.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\r\nEnjoyment is really up to the beholder. My view of enjoyment may be somewhat different from others\u2019. Clannad is not for everybody, but for those who dropped the first season, ~AS~ is truly on a league of its own and worth another shot. Every person has that one anime that leaps up above the rest and leaves a lasting impression. For me, that anime was Clannad ~AS~. No other words can describe the effect it had on me, and I hope that this review has at least made you, the reader, consider picking up this diamond in the rough.\\n\\n\\n\r\n| Final Thoughts |\\n\r\nThank you for your time (I know the review was long), and I sincerely wish that you give Clannad ~AS~ a chance. Who knows, it may change your life. As always, comments about how effectively this review worked are welcome. Also, a helpful rating is always appreciated.",

            "content": "Recently I had the absolute pleasure of watching Clannad: After Story.  I had previously seen the original Clannad and liked it as a light-hearted slice of life anime, good but not amazing.  I went into After Story expecting the same thing, but what I got was something fantastically different.\r\nStory- 10/10\r\nAs I said before, I started After Story expecting it to have the same light-hearted high school drama feel as the first season and, unfortunately, the first eight episodes did nothing to prove me wrong.  The first eight episodes are Clannad at its storytelling worst, more specifically the Sunohara arc.  Thankfully, Clannadat its storytelling worst is simply \"okay\".  The Sunohara arc makes Youhei's younger sister, Mei, seem like a nosy and irrational little girl in contrast to the mature-beyond-her-years character that the writers seemed to be trying to present her as.  The Yukine arc was better, but it pushes the boundaries of Tomoya's \"good Samaritan\" personality a bit too far.  The Misae arc is good by itself, but has very little to do with the story or the characters that we care about.  If it weren't for each arc each containing details that are vital to the enjoyment of understanding of the later part of the anime, I would recommend skipping the first eight episodes altogether to get straight to the real good stuff.\\n\r\nThankfully, the latter part of After Story more than makes up for its mediocre first act with the absolute greatest storytelling in anime.  After Story quickly gets back on its feet and shows what truly makes it great as we ride the greatest emotional rollercoaster in recent memory.  The ending has caused some controversy for being too ambiguous to fully understand without having played the video game, but I feel otherwise.  Granted, I had to see the anime twice before I truly understood it, but I was nonetheless able to figure out exactly what happened without any outside help.  It's a tough one, but it's very possible.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile the main setting has its moments of visual awe, the artistic aspect of the anime truly shines in the beautiful and surreal \"hidden world\".  The impact differs greatly from the main world, boasting beautiful lighting, animation, and colors.  In the main world, colors do a great job of changing from bright to dull based on the situation and animation is polished to a shine.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI've always been a big fan of a musical score acting as a compliment to whats happening on screen rather than a mere accompaniment.  Clannad: After Story masterfully pairs its score with each event to further the emotional impact of each scene.  It is done so well, in fact, that one cannot hear the music on its own without feeling some kind of emotion attached to that song by a certain event from the anime.  The OP is good and very versatile in setting the correct emotional tone for each episode.  On the downside, the bouncy, poppy ED is often horribly inappropriate to the emotions that you are left with at the end of each episode and is almost guaranteed to ruin the mood if you aren't quick enough to stop it.  I found myself sometimes ending the episode early when the scene seemed like an ending due to my fear of facing the buzzkill of an ED.\\n\r\nOn the voice acting side, the English performances are top-notch.  Each character is paired with a voice that fits their appearance and personality very well and that can easily be recognized among other voices.  Luci Christian gives a flawless performance as both English Nagisa and Ushio, and Andrew Love does really great stuff with the situations he is put in as Akio.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are without a doubt the strongest aspect of After Story.  Each one is as incredibly human as they are likable, and their easiness to get attached to is one of the biggest reasons that the anime has such a great emotional impact.  When the characters are suffering, it as if one of our friends is suffering, and when they are happy, we are happy for them.  I have never felt such an attachment to a set of characters as I did in After Story.  Each character plays so well off of each other, including Tomoya and Nagisa, who are without a doubt the greatest couple in anime.  In most stories, be it in books, cinema, or television, the romance sub plot is almost always one of two things, the incredibly good-looking and nice alpha-male protagonist gets paired with the incredibly good-looking romantic interest, or the incredibly good-looking and nice but shy protagonist gets paired with the incredibly good-looking romantic interest.  In both scenarios, the two characters are always blessed with the perfect personalities and that's why they go so well together.  Tomoya and Nagisa are different.  Neither of them have perfect personalities, but both of their personalities are able to compliment the other's.  Tomoya's hot headedness is able to be cooled by Nagisa's quiet, strong demeanor.  It's not perfect gets paired with perfect, it's human finds human.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAfter I finished Clannad: After Story for the first time, there was only one thing I wanted to do: watch the entire series again, so I did.  I know that the word \"experience\" is overused in film and television, but that's exactly what After Story is.  I don't cry during movies or anime.  I've seen Elfen Lied, Old Yeller, My Dog Skip, Grave of the Fireflies, etc.  You name it, I've seen it and didn't shed a tear.  Clannad: After Story made me cry like a girl multiple times, and the reason it did is because it's different from anything else I've ever seen before in one way.  It is able to appeal to the most human parts of you, whether it's Tomoya's responsibility as a man or Nagisa's inherent ability to remain positive for the sake of the people she loves, the one thing that makes this anime so emotionally powerful is the fact that you could see it happening to you.",

            "content": "Emotions are a powerful thing; they have the capability to override any modicum of rationality and force even the ficklest of beings to succumb to their emotional disposition. Due to this, often times, those of us who claim ourselves to be critics of various mediums fall short of our own expectations. \u201cClannad After Story\u201d, a series described as \u201clife-changing\u201d by many is the perfect suspect; a production that captured the hearts of the majority that viewed it while instantly becoming a classic within its genre. Littered with subpar designed moe characters, irrelevant arcs, contradictory elements, forced plot devices, and a plethora of other obvious issues,it truly is baffling how effective an appeal to pathos can be. Although, the series has plenty of redeeming qualities, the title it has so profusely clenched--that of a masterpiece by a large consensus, must indeed be questioned.\\n\\n\r\n--Story/Plot :5/10--\\n\\n\r\n\u201cAfter Story\u201d takes place right after the first season of Clannad and chronicles the lives of certain characters from the first season, primarily focusing on Tomoya, his relationship with Nagisa and more importantly, himself.  It attempts to bring a sense of realism to its viewer through the joys and hardships that Tomoya goes through and accomplishes that for a while. It also eliminates the harem aspect of season one and adopts a much more serious tone.\\n\\n\r\nThe series spans 24-episodes with the first 10-episodes composed of various arcs dealing with other characters and their corresponding dilemmas while the rest of the show focuses on the primary protagonists. This brings up the problem of structure and inconsistency. The initial problem with \u201cAfter Story\u201d is the characters that are focused on for the first 10 episodes. With the exception of the Misae arc as it LOOSELY connects to the magical component of the show, the other arcs have no direct relevance to the overarching story nor do they serve any function in moving the plot, but are just thrown in there, forcing unnecessary drama. This also causes a huge gap in consistency between the first part of the show and the rest, especially in regards to quality. However, the next few episodes are a pleasure to watch as they highlight Tomoya\u2019s evolution as a character along with his relationship with Nagisa. Structurally, \u201cAfter Story\u201d fell short, consequently causing a gap in quality and consistency. \\n\\n\r\nSubstantially, \u201cAfter Story\u201d has its share of delightful moments, but those are restricted to a very limited amount of episodes. The story is unoriginal, but imbues concepts and themes that are very real and relatable such as: imploring responsibility and growing up, the innateness of hardships, the importance of relationships, moving on, and many others that are close to home. Yet, \u201cAfter Story\u201d manages to ruin the very thing it tries to achieve. The show spends a great deal of time trying to evoke \u201crealism\u201d through manifesting the aforementioned themes, but subsequently destroys that with its detachment from reality and deus ex machina resolve. For example, one of the arcs in the earlier part of the series shows how two supposedly bitter and rival gangs end up being bros4lyfe via some [extraneous] female side-character. I may not have a proper grasp on gang psychology, but I\u2019m fairly certain that the odds of something like a dudefest and \u201cunderstanding\u201d blossoming between two rival gangs are astronomical. This notion of \u201cbonds of friendships overcoming everything\u201d is extremely over exaggerated deeming many of the earlier arcs unrealistic,  effectively leaving me in a state of overwhelming ennui. \\n\\n\r\nFor a series that tries to emphasize real life, especially while trying to deal with issues such as loss, acceptance, etc., it negates all validity by embracing a faux idealism grounded in wish fulfillment. The realism juxtaposed with magical idealism/wish fulfillment really disintegrates the show by the end. However, that is probably one of the overarching reasons the show is as popular it is, because instead of staying true to its realistic core, it defaults into fantasy, idealism, and wish fulfillment. It\u2019s successful but at the cost of complete contradiction therefore making After Story somewhat of a Pyrrhic victory. It should be noted that there is nothing wrong with having a plot based on supernatural/metaphysical notions, however, when the show is simultaneously trying to bring a strong sense of realism to the front, it becomes counter-productive and contradictory. I can\u2019t even incorporate this under efficient \u201cmagical realism\u201d because of how badly the two are handled when looked at as a pair. \\n\\n\r\nEssentially, where \u201cAfter Story\u201d excels at is deception. It does an excellent job serenading its viewer into a false lull making it seem exponentially better than it actually is by manipulating sympathetic themes and completely over exaggerating them, however, when dissected the story offers nothing unique, let alone life altering. It\u2019s a good effort, but that\u2019s all it is, an effort, that has its comely yet ephemeral moments. Conclusively, \"After Story\" ends up stumbling within its own narrative and resolution.\\n\\n\r\n--Character: 6/10--\\n\\n\r\n \u201cAfter Story\u201d gets a ridiculous amount of praise for having \u201chuman-like\u201d characters, however, the series lacks greatly in terms of balanced characterization. Tomoya is well developed and one can partly empathize with his struggles as he tries to shuffle through the various challenges he encounters. Tomoya\u2019s progression is probably the most realistic part of the show and is fairly well-executed. While the show gives us a dynamic Tomoya, we are left face-palming in deep regret and resentment with the lack of attention given to Nagisa. There is nothing memorable about her; struck with some unknown illness, we often see her washing dishes for like three continuous episodes. I felt no sort of attachment, relation, or even empathy towards Nagisa, rather her lack of progression had the opposite effect. Her static, ing\u00e9nue personality got unbearable. Oh and she can\u2019t hold her liquor. That just heightened my insouciance even further. The futility of Nagisa truly is a burden on \u201cAfter Story\u201d. \\n\\n\r\nThe over-development of one protagonist and under-development of the other did not have a neutralizing effect, but a detrimental one. Their relationship is the foundation of \u201cAfter Story\u201d but it remains immature, mainly due to Nagisa\u2019s incomplete characterization. Instead of spending the initial 10 episodes on completely useless characters, the series could have utilized the same time to construct Nagisa into a character with dimension, personality, and purpose. The show spent so much time trying to build this false delusion about how \u201cfriendship solves everything\u201d that essential aspects got completely disregarded. Tomoya along with an unmentioned character carry the weight of \u201cAfter Story\u201d.  In hopes of keeping this review spoiler free, only the two main protagonists (Tomoya x Nagisa) are discussed.\\n\\n\r\nThere are plenty of supporting/side characters in the show, some making cameos (from season one), others for reasons I have yet to understand. The only notable side characters are Nagisa\u2019s parents who provide some comedic relief (which is the same recycled humor of the first season) but they still manage to maintain their likability. \\n\\n\r\n--Art/Animation: 7/10--\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t hold your breath expecting anything aesthetically orgasmic. The girls are molded with \u201cmoe\u201d in mind at all times: Unrealistic character designs for a \u201crealistic\u201d anime.  In terms of the actual art, \u201cAfter Story\u201d does a fairly good job. Bright colors are often used to accompany the magical atmosphere and vibrancy of life that the show is grounded upon. There are instances of visually striking scenes scattered here and there, especially with some of the natural backgrounds. There is always light illuminating from somewhere, even in the darker scenes. The one place where the animation did shine is while depicting the \u201cillusionary\u201d world. The background, colors, and overall depiction of that world is nicely done as it provides a very surreal atmosphere to the viewer. However, don\u2019t expect gorgeous animation akin to something like \u201c5 centimeter\u201d. It\u2019s nice, but nothing exceptional. \\n\\n\r\n--Sound: 6/10--\\n\\n\r\n\u201cAfter Story\u201d has a viable soundtrack that fit its purposes. Composed of subtle, soft, and sometimes melancholic piano music, the OST is pleasant, but conventional. It wasn't something that compelled me to go download or re-listen to. The same applies to the OP/ED selections. They are very imminent and \u201cof-the-moment\u201d in the sense that they are enjoyable and appropriate at the time they played. However, I almost always forwarded the OP and rarely listened to ED. The voice actors are fitting in regards to their respective roles.\\n\\n\r\n--Overall/Enjoyment: 6/10--\\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly, \u201cAfter Story\u201d is at the forefront its genre because of its inherent ability to capitalize on emotions and \u201cfeels\u201d to the point where many \u201cmanly\u201d tears are shed and lives are changed. However, I could not relate; as the anime defied all levels of logic with convenient plot devices, contradicted its own pursuit of realism, over-dramatized situations, wasted 11 episodes of my time with frankly fatuous arcs, and underestimated the importance of complete characterization--emotions no longer mattered. After all, feels and impact are evanescent, quality is what remains. \\n\\n\r\n\"After Story\u201d therefore didn\u2019t really leave a strong impact on me nor did I learn some particularly significant lesson about life nor did I put my feels on suicide watch. Nevertheless, the four or five episodes towards the middle/end are truly poignant and laudable\u2014if  \u201cAfter Story\u201d  could have maintained that level of quality throughout and refrained from committing some of the aforementioned blunders, the series would have lived up to its hype. Alas, I cannot rate a 24-episode series any higher based on my enjoyment of five episodes. My \u201cAfter Story\u201d experience is a step away from the norm and that\u2019s the reason I spewed all of this\u2014to offer some solace to those who couldn\u2019t cry those manly tears or indulge in wish fulfillment, while also providing another perspective to those who have yet to watch it that isn\u2019t soaked in sheer \u201cfeels\u201d. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "*Yet another successful heart warming series produced by Kyoto Animation that surpasses its predecessor.*\r\n\u201c\u2026 an astounding series with a slightly less astounding conclusion.\u201d\r\nDue to the frequent references to Clannad (first season), from here on, the term \u201cClannad\u201d will be used when referring to season 1 and \u201cAfter Story\u201d will be used for season 2 and the term \u201cClannad After Story\u201d will be used when referring to the Clannad series as a whole. A few friendly reminders before we begin. After Story is a direct continuation of Clannad, thus it is not very \u201cnew audience-friendly\u201d. Knowledge of certain key events and character relations are expected fromviewers. Again, due to After Story being a direct continuation (in story) from Clannad, and the latter ended with a climax of sort, it is unreasonable for us to expect After Story to start off with the same level of intensity. In layman\u2019s term, don\u2019t expect the show to start with a bang.\\n\\n\r\nWhat exactly is After Story? In short, it is an emotion evoking machine designed in such a way as to suck dry your tears. By combining music, dialogue, and animation (often from the facial expression), After Story has the ability to dominate even the mightiest cold blooded person on this planet. Crappy live drama should learn/adopt some of the plots/techniques used in the anime. They should be ashamed of themselves because some anime by the name of Clannad After Story can present a much better dramatic story as a whole. In addition, After Story can squeeze the deep down juicy emotions inside you that not much live drama (if there is any) can ever accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nThose who are familiar with Clannad should have no difficulty identifying various strong points evident in After Story (such as high quality animation), but perhaps one may not be too familiar with the weaknesses of After Story. While some may claim the following \u201cugly\u201d facts to be minor issues, it is only fair on my part to present both sides of an argument, so to speak.\\n\\n\r\nInappropriate ending theme. The MUSIC makes Clannad what it is (more into that later), but sadly there are occasions when the ending theme just ruins everything the episode worked so hard for. It is important to note that the ED song itself is not bad; it just does not fit in especially with the latter half of After Story.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cClannad Magic\u201d. The magic might work on some viewers, but for the rest of us who are looking for a more realistic story it was somewhat a let down to say the very least. I still recall people used to ask me the difference between Kanon and Clannad, and usually my reply will be the following, \u201c\u2026 well Clannad is the more realistic version of Kanon as far as the main story between the protagonists is concerned \u2026 nothing too supernatural \u2026\u201d but the magical performance totally destroyed it. \\n\\n\r\nAs previously stated, the author of this review (ie. me) is simply presenting issues of what seem to be hindrances to After Story from achieving a perfect 10/10 masterpiece for some demanding viewers. In fact, After Story is a show overwhelmed with prettiness. Depending on your definition of prettiness it could mean any or all of the following but let me assure you that there is absolutely no exaggeration involved.\\n\\n\r\nLyrics, Music and BGM! Normally song lyrics are not a big factor in an anime, but After Story\u2019s OP is just too fabulous to ignore. Slowly, I began to learn the meaning behind the song. If you read the lyrics in detail, it is clear that the song is a summary of the story of Clannad After Story. A particularly heart warming chunk of the song lyrics is provided below.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe chilly days continue on, even though it\u2019s already spring.\\n\r\nOn the mornings I woke earlier than the alarm clock,\\n\r\nYou, making breakfast for three,\\n\r\nWould be standing there.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nI would refrain myself from explaining the meanings behind the lyrics, but I hope you can have a rough picture of what kind of story Clannad is getting at just by that one simple verse. You can find the lyrics (in English and Japanese) from the link below. \\n\\n\r\nhttp://bambooxzx.wordpress.com/2008/11/13/clannad-after-story-toki-wo-kizamu-uta-2/\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, music is one of the key features making Clannad After Story a successful business. Music in Clannad After Story is not simply music. Likewise, BGM is not simply BGM either in the context of After Story. They blend in with the animation, characters, and story. They all compliment each other to bring out the maximum effect to each scene.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation! The animation quality is slightly better than previous Key adapations by Kyoto Animation. For those who are not familiar with the producer, Kyoto Animation (products include Kanon (2006), AIR, Full Metal Panic series, Lucky Star, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Kiddy Grade, et cetera.) has a pretty good reputation for its high level animation. Simply put, one will be find nothing but beautifully drawn girls, dynamic backgrounds, silky smooth scenes transition, and completely fluid movements in this touching anime. There is, however, not much difference (if at all) in the quality between Clannad and After Story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters! One great thing about the characters in Clannad After Story is no matter if they are main or supporting casts, they all seem to be part of a jigsaw puzzle. The show would not be the same without any one of them. What makes After Story superior from its predecessor is its focus on the main protagonists (ie. Nagisa and Tomoya) for the most part of the show. This is evidently lacking in season one because other heroines\u2019 story had to be covered, thus leading to an ambiguous character relationships development between Tomoya and various heroines. Although not a major Nagisa fan myself, one should realize the importance of her character and how it all connect to the story\u2019s main theme. \\n\\n\r\nStory! After Story is all about the story! It is by far the prettiest of all the pretty traits that one can think of about Clannad After Story. On the whole, the Clannad series is an astounding series with a slightly less astounding ending. Slightly less astounding partly due to the magic, but could also be due to another reason. Assuming some of us has been paying attention to what Kotomi has been explaining regarding the works of her parents, then perhaps we can take a more scientific analytical approach to the ending via something known as the Omega Point Theory. Due to the lack of spoiler tags, further analysis of the ending will not be possible for this review. However, the following blog will prove to be extremely valuable. \\n\\n\r\nhttp://animewriter.wordpress.com/2009/03/14/clannad-after-story-22-the-conclusion-the-place-where-wishes-come-true/\\n\\n\r\nLet us just say that the story for Clannad After Story is deep and \u201cpretty\u201d, and leave it at that. \\n\\n\r\n***If you find the overall concept and plot of the Clannad series confusing, please visit the following link and it should clear things up.\\n\\n\r\nhttp://i527.photobucket.com/albums/cc354/KaminaKun/Others/1236943573387.png\\n\\n\r\n --> thanks goes to fellow member Eternal-Dragon for providing me with the diagram.***\\n\\n\r\nSimply put, Clannad is LIFE, period. It lets you experience a wide variety of emotions such as anger, jealousy, joy, love, sorrow, pain, hardship, friendship, and most importantly the care from your family. From the ridiculous comedies presented by Sunohara (or Fuko), to the naivety shown by Nagisa (or Fuko), one can always relate characters and/or events in Clannad to some direct/indirect personal experiences. Additionally, Clannad also teach you the meaning to LIFE. Next time when you are on the verge of starting an argument with your parents, just think about Tomoya and his dad. Think of all the hardships and difficulties your parents went through to feed you and raise you to make you become who you are. You will never know, maybe Clannad can really teach you a thing or two.\\n\\n\r\nIn an unrelated note, for those who enjoyed watching the Nagisa x Tomoya pairing and at the same time disliked the magical performances throughout the show (particularly the ending), then it is recommended that you give the Clannad movie a try.",

            "content": "\"Do you like this school? I really, really love it. But nothing can stay unchanged. Fun things... Happy things... They can't all possibly stay unchanged. Even so, can you keep on loving this place?\" \r\nHow does one cope in a world that is always changing? And are we ever truly alone? \r\nThe above questions are foundational to the series of Clannad After Story, a story of love, loss, redemption, happiness, sadness, togetherness, and change.\r\nI will start by commending Key, the brains behind this show. Like other works of theirs, (Notably Kanon, Air, and the first season of Clannad), it is beautifully written and incredibly aestheticallydetailed, with well designed environments and a soundtrack that fits the context to a tee. Added to the compelling characters, this anime is in my somewhat biased opinion a masterpiece. I'll start with the story.\\n\\n\r\nAs a story by Key, I went into the anime with some expectations. Not only was I not disappointed, I was sent from small fits of laughter to open sobs and bawling more quickly than I would have liked (very manly, testosterone-charged sobs and bawling, of course).\\n\\n\r\nThe anime starts right near the end of the first season of Clannad and picks up quickly. Nearly all of those \"minor\" characters from the first season are given more time, their stories are displayed in a very accessible manner, and there is a feeling of very little \"filler\". Almost all of the characters have you caring about them (and feeling happy or sad for their situations,) by the time the story ends.\\n\\n\r\nThese stories play out against the backdrop of Nagisa and Tomoya's relationship, their trials and happy times, as Tomoya becomes a man of society. A distinct shift of the angle and scope of the anime is witnessed, as Tomoya moves into the \"real world\". One of my favorite parts of the story came from the implementation of Nagisa's parents, Akio and Sanae. I will discuss this implementation later.\\n\\n\r\nDuring most of the story, I felt as if I was actually living the lives of the characters I was watching. Realistic scripting, well chosen voice actors (Mostly the same from the first season), and strong writing right from the beginning gave me the impression that this could actually be a real story, happening somewhere on the planet (with some minor exceptions that are related to the story).\\n\\n\r\nThe themes of change and family are expressed continuously, from the changing city to the powerful interconnectedness of family, friends, or larger communities. The OP and ED become more powerful as the story continues on, and the connections made to the first season are near perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThere is more than one climax to this story, and it is barely short of amazing how there can be so much emotion packed into 24 episodes (though the 24 of the first season play a role here). \\n\\n\r\nThe ending was very pretty, I especially liked the ending of the 24th \"recap\" episode (which I would consider a part of the After Story experience as it provides some final closure).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story is so beautifully done that aside from one potentially confusing part near the end, the plot is watertight and expressed in a way that is easy to connect with. Next I will discuss the art and sound.\\n\\n\r\nIf the entire After Story anime consisted of just the OP and ED, I would have awarded it somewhere around an 8.5. The combination of theme song (Toki wo Kizamu Uta by Lia,) and stunning visuals sent shivers down my spine many of the times I watched it. Both the OP and ED gain more as the story goes on, as more subtle details are revealed in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nI have always been a big fan of the Key visual style, but the visual style of this anime is very impressive. The characters as can be expected are very well detailed, but what is stunning about this anime is the amount of detail in the environments. Every building and nearly every person, near or far, important or not, is well detailed. Seeing the wood grain in a power pole when the pole is barely hanging in the scene. Or the swaying of each individual plant in a field during sunset, as the orangeish hue nearly matches that of a sunset in the real world. This and more all combines to produce a very appealing look and serves to immerse the viewer in a world that is not their own (though one might wish it were, for how pretty it is).\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is impressive. Many of the songs come from the first season, but  some less well used songs in the original get used more often in this season. The choice of where the soundtrack is implemented is pivotal, and this anime is very good at knowing when to emphasize the emotion or when to provide a contrast that might nudge the viewer, \"Time still goes forward; life still goes on!\" \\n\\n\r\nLastly, I will talk about what I believe is the most important portion of any story, and especially so for this one: the characters.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Story provides an amazing level of character depth. None of the first season of Clannad is forgotten, and various past issues and memories are brought back. \\n\\n\r\nThe development of the \"minor\" characters plays a very important role in this anime. Though Tomoya is the main character, one gets the sense that there are no arbitrary characters in the anime at all. Everyone has a past, a story, and a place where they can fit into the extended family of Tomoya. \\n\\n\r\nTomoya is one of the most realistically portrayed anime characters I have seen in some time. Viewers will remember him as the slightly hot-headed but caring figure from the first season. Tomoya undergoes a remarkable transformation in this series, and the contrast (which is well-emphasized in After Story) is very well done.  Finally, I want to take a quick second to recognize something I liked that Key did with this anime: the implementation of Nagisa's parents.\\n\\n\r\nThough they had relatively brief appearances in the first season, Akio and Sanae play incredibly powerful roles in After Story. They are characterized as deeply caring parents that will do anything for the happiness of their family. They stand as a beacon of love and support for both Nagisa and Tomoya, and can be as funny as they are compassionate.Though not always on the front lines, viewers can expect any issues encountered by the characters to be thoughtfully and thoroughly dealt with by these two.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime is borderline phenomenal. In between moments of laughing and crying, there is a plethora of amazing characters, portrayed with the right music, detailed in beautiful environments, and built into a fantastic story that is very pretty, both in concept and implementation. I would heavily recommend this anime to anyone who is into Key stuff, who has seen Clannad, or just someone who wants to use a whole box of tissues from all of the happy/sad crying one is bound to do. \\n\\n\r\nIn response to the first quote of this (longer than I had expected) review in the words of Tomoya, \\n\\n\r\n\"Just find them; just find new fun and happy things. C'mon, let's get going.\"\\n\\n",

            "content": "The original series, the highly rated \"Clannad\", was one painful viewing experience for me - not because it's full of tragic tales, but because of how dire it is. Female characters sugary enough to induce diabetes in a lump of rock, combined with atrociously forced \"drama\" fast tracked it to a lofty position on my \"Overrated Shite\" list. And yet its ratings pales in comparison to that of its sequel, \"Clannad: After Story\".\r\nGiven my experiences with the first series, I hadn't originally intended to watch \"Clannad: After Story\", but people kept telling me how much better it was and how different it was compared tothe first season. Intrigued, I decided to give it shot...\\n\\n\r\n...and boy was I disappointed.\\n\\n\r\n\"Clannad: After Story\" was supposedly a different kettle of fish from \"Clannad\", but it's obvious to me that it's the same kettle, with mostly the same fish inside - it's still very moe; the melodrama is still clumsily manipulative; it's still unmistakably \"Clannad\".\\n\\n\r\nUnlike \"Clannad\" though, \"Clannad: After Story\" is somewhat inconsistent. But I mean that as a back hand compliment, in that \"Clannad: After Story\" had the some good moments amongst the crap, while \"Clannad\" was just consistently crap.\\n\\n\r\nThe first part of \"Clannad: After Story\" is almost indistinguishable from \"Clannad\". It continues from where the original series left off, taking on a similar format comprising mini-arcs of various happenings around the school. Since Tomoya and Brown Haired Girl are already an item at the start of this series, there is no longer a harem aspect. You would think this would improve things, but in the case of this anime, all it meant was that it concentrated on mass producing contrived melodrama instead.\\n\\n\r\nThe first arc, starring Sunohara, was one of the worst offenders. It started off as a comedy, and although some parts were a bit tasteless, it was at least tolerable. Half way through though, it tried to turn into a serious drama, and it was all downhill from there on. The problem is that, as with most stories involving Sunohara, the comedy is quite ridiculous, involving an absurd set up that you simply can't take seriously, but the drama directly extends from that set up, and the anime seems to think it's fine to try and deliver emotional punches off this same platform that was used to deliver goofy punchlines shortly before. There are also glaring problems in the plot and inconsistencies in the portrayal of Sunohara's character, but the real crux is this: these problems are not oversights - these are the consequences of the show's willingness to sacrifice everything in order to crank up drama to 11. Not surprising then, that I found it so unconvincing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so \"Clannad: After Story\" continues in typical \"Clannad\" fashion, spinning implausible, almost surreal sob stories about its bizarrely troubled characters ... until around episode 10. This is the point where Tomoya and his ex-harem members graduate and make their way into the big wide world. It marks the beginning of what made many consider \"Clannad: After Story\" to be one of the greatest anime ever made. So I approached the show renewed hope...\\n\\n\r\n...only to be disappointed once more.\\n\\n\r\nHowever much \"Clannad: After Story\" changes its settings, it still approaches drama with the subtle touch of a rapist. While I admit that the show does mature somewhat, its maturity is much like the way Brown Haired Girl matures during the show - she became more like a 15 year-old than a 10 year-old. An improvement it may be, but it's debatable whether this 50% increase in maturity is worthy of lavish praise when \\n\\n\r\n1) the initial bar was set so stupidly low, and \\n\r\n2) she's supposed to be in her twenties by the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nBut allow me to pause in the middle of my acid spewing in order to acknowledge that there are definitely merits found in this part of the story, and that's enough to make it by far the best part of the whole franchise.\\n\\n\r\nAs is always the case, these best parts centred around Tomoya himself and not some dipshit moe girl or some other retarded side character. One of the stories dealt with Tomoya trying to settle into a job and striving to overcome, amongst other difficulties, his physical handicap. This I liked, because above all, it was unembellished, believable drama - he actually had plausible real world problems to deal with, which isn't something to take for granted in the world of \"Clannad\", despite it often being labelled as a real life drama.\\n\\n\r\nIt's fair to say that the franchise would be a lot worse without Tomoya; he was almost carrying the show single handedly. But there was one other, newly introduced in \"Clannad: After Story\", who shared his burden of being a rare good character stuck in the cesspit of shit ones. It's not too surprising then, that the stretch of episodes focusing almost solely on the two of them are the best ones that \"Clannad: After Story\" has to offer. Its emotional apex, a gorgeous scene set in a field of golden flowers tinted red in the setting sun, is hands down the most touching moment in the combined two seasons of the show. Emotional but not forcefully so, it captured the central theme of family with a poignancy and sincerity that's most unusual for the show.\\n\\n\r\nBut that, I'm afraid, is the last remaining good thing I have to say about \"Clannad: After Story\".\\n\\n\r\nIn between the aforementioned high points, and even entwined with them, crappy arcs and sub-plots are found in abundance. Amongst them, there's the incident of an all important decision reached via baseball, and another one that dealt with matters between Tomoya and his dad. The former looks to be an instance of \"Clannad: After Story\" trying to be subtle by approaching the matter at hand in a round-a-bout manner, in the same way that an elephant might try to do ballet; the latter is another classic case of the show sacrificing its characters to the drama. Time and time again over the course of the two seasons I witnessed Human Plot Device, aka Tomoya's dad, demonstrate his immense capability by taking on whatever personality the plot required, and this unsurprisingly resulted in his character feeling like an unfathonable, contradicting mess.\\n\\n\r\nTo say the remaining episodes were unsatisfactory would be an understatement. To begin with there was the re-appearance of one of the most fucking annoying characters I've ever had misfortune of encountering, which invoked more sadness within me than all the sad stories in the whole series put together. And then there's the ending. I don't want to give spoilers, so I'll just say that not only was it confusing, but I would have felt cheated if I didn't have so little emotional investment in the show to be cheated out of.\\n\\n\r\nThat aside, there's also some weird business going on with the ending to the main story not being the last episode of the series. There are two more episodes after the main ending: the first one is an alternative reality side story; the other one, the final episode, is just a recap. It's as if the show was going for the most anti-climatic end to a series ever. The purpose of throwing in that side story eludes me, but the re-cap's summarising did help to make the ending clearer. It doesn't clear up everything though, and there are major plot elements that remain baffling to the end. I did come across an informative time line that made references to the visual novel, and in all honesty, I was quite impressed with the grand scheme of what I saw. Unfortunately, various aspects of the plot failed to translate during the adaptation. Most notably, the visual novel mechanics they tried to port across caused plenty of confusion. The irony is that by trying to be more faithful to the source material, the anime actually ended up being worse off.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the ending is just a single nail in a rather large coffin; the show's problems run far deeper, right down to the conceptual level. Other than being filled with moe blobs that barely qualifies as characters, I get the impression that the franchise has been developed from a completely wrong approach. Instead of starting with some good ideas and letting them grow into good stories organically, it feels like the writers started with the intention of making the biggest fucking weepfest ever, then threw in whatever ludicrous ideas that came into their heads in order to achieve their goal. As a result, values like story and character integrity were continuously being compromised to make the show more tragic superficially. This might have been forgivable if it only happened on occasion, but when it's the bread and butter aspects of the story, the end product simply isn't a good drama.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just emotion pr0n.",

            "content": "After watching many anime and reading many manga, I would recommend Clannad AS to most people just as strongly as when I first finished it. (I cry to it just as much too.) What sets After Story apart for me is the encompassing world it develops in addition to the main story. The completeness of the narrative is beautiful and rare, since many other media products of our time give up on telling a complete story for a variety of reasons. A plethora of stories are all told at once for the imaginative viewer who appreciates all of the series' nuances. Without spoilers, by thefinal episode many if not all side characters have matured and you feel this maturity authentically. This leads you to consider how you yourself, your friends, your family, and your community have matured. I think After Story appeals most to reflective viewers.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Story is quintessentially Japanese with no compromises. It both frames the world with elements of traditional culture (slightly patriarchal approach to relationship with fragile female protagonist, refusing money from parents for the sake of honor, immediate respect for grandparent) and shows the world with elements of modern life (changing city, new construction, environmental preservation, long working hours). (Also, there aren't yet cell phones, which itself is fascinating to think about for sociological purposes.) This is both refreshing and realistic in the world of anime: After Story doesn't seem like it's using a medium with fantasy elements only to escape reality. It takes life as it is and, overlooking a few contrived missteps, shows how the characters change the existing reality for themselves while being inextricably tied to it. Tomoya even considers running away from his problems by leaving the city with Nagisa (metaphorically escaping almost everything about his reality), but she reasons with him about the family he has in the city.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, I found myself quite able to interpret the story in my own way. Outside of the humor and occasional filler, there are many important moments available for reflection. This appreciation for stillness and reflection (even occasionally outside of slice of life), I think, is the strongest argument for why anime is a medium and not a genre, and why it appeals to certain types of people more than others. One of my highlights in the first season was Tomoyo's conversation at sunset with Tomoya, where they theorized about 'family'. The essence of 'family' further explored by After Story is complex and multithreaded, and remains the defining question and legacy of the whole series. If you personally identify with the series, the questions raised by the series may remain a part of your everyday reality no matter what stage of life you are in. They may even cause you to think about everyone else in your life in new ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of the series was the strongest aspect for me, both in After Story and the first series. It opened my mind up through emotions to consider the realities and struggles of the different characters. Consider all of the scenarios presented in the first season. What must life be like for Kotomi, studying all alone in the library those long hours, living a life completely different from the high schoolers around her? In the real world with degree inflation in Asia where university has become a safe haven for students who can't get jobs yet are quite intelligent, what will become of students like her? Will all her domain-specific scientific knowledge become obsolete thanks to databases and her inexperience with cutting-edge electronic equipment? Think about Tomoyo. In a world of big data and near-total destruction of privacy, there may be less chance to change who society believes you are. Think about Kyou's future role as providing familial comfort and understanding to all the primary schoolchildren who don't have a family life as both parents work long hours. Think about Nagisa's parents, who would have a tough or impossible time paying for Nagisa's college with their modest-income jobs after sacrificing their dream careers. Are such parents realistic in families of the future? And the future Yusukes in developed countries may need to sacrifice even more family time to their jobs to sustain services in societies with many retired seniors. On a level closer to the canon, how will changes in Nagisa and Tomoya's life impact the people and the city around them over the years? More abstractly, to what degree do changes in the family of the city affect the family of friends and actual families? In After Story, just as in the first season, the music encourages thoughtful, probing questions for imaginative types and shows how much change time can bring. Perhaps the music can become a part of your life as you associate a song with a certain time period. For me, \"To the Same Heights\" contains a wonderful mixture of hope, uncertainty, and wonder in facing the future.\\n\\n\r\nSome people will not enjoy this anime. The moe art style may seem unsuited to the depth of the storyline (although for me, it seems merely an extreme case of the wonderful juxtaposition of innocence and hope against harsh realities in a similar vein as Madoka vs Kyubey, Akane vs Makishima and Sibyl, or even Honoka, Umi, and Kotori in front of an empty theater). The story arc before episode 9 in After Story is not realistic. The drama may be too intense for them, and the everyday dialogue too melodramatic. Yet starting with episode 9, I think what follows is the finest piece of storytelling that will exist in anime for a very long time.\\n\\n\r\nTake all the happy and sad things and roll them up.

It's ok, you can click unhelpful now, I won't mind.\r\nThis anime is ranked higher than Spirited Away.\r\nI said I understand two times, yet it is really a mystery to me. Still I understand why people like this sort of thing, there are many fanboys and fangirls out there who wish they found that special no-personality, clumsy,sweet, IQ=fishstick person that's just right for them, but when people who I share anime preferences with and I think of as respected watchers of anime give this thing 9's and 10's then something is wrong, something is up, probably with me. There must be something I don't see in this, something great, something wonderful, something fabulous... yea I said fabulous.

I can not for my life understand how anyone, anyone at all can give this anime a higher rating, when it comes to characters, than let's say a 6... and that's stretching it. This is all I'm going to say as I'm sure everyone has seen this anime and can make up their own mind about how wonderfully awesome it is, the engrossing elaborate plot and storyboard, the wonderful screenplay that is oh so breathtaking and don't get me started on that main protagonist who is truly a masterpiece when it comes to personality, he really underwent some serious character development during this anime... yeah!\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is ranked higher than Welcome to the NHK!",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nClannad: After Story is one of the highest rated and most beloved anime to ever be created; it's as simple as that. Rarely will you find a more passionate and dedicated group of fans who genuinely believe that an anime \"changed their life\".  If that is the case, I am by no means trying to take that away from you; I would never tell someone that a show is meaningless if it legitimately meant something to them. However, I am going to be very harsh on this anime; I think I am very justified in giving it this rating. There are way,WAY too many perfect reviews for this series that refuse to acknowledge its flaws, so this review will focus primarily on the negatives of the series, even though there are many things that it does well. In other words: CLANNAD FANS, READ WITH CAUTION!\\n\\n\r\nMy main problem with the show is simply this: The first half of After Story is guilty of  going down the worst possible road that a shoujo anime can go down: the dreaded road of \"emotion porn\", and some of it is absolutely unbearable. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the term, \"emotion porn\" refers any story/storyarc in a form of media that is incredibly shallow and uses gratuitous amounts of melodrama  in order to get a cheap cry out of it's audience. \"Emotion Porn\" is directed at the emotionally immature and at those who are desperate for a cry, and unfortunately, After Story's first half is jam packed with it.\\n\\n\r\n\"How dare you!!!\", cried the Clannad fans.\\n\r\n\"There is nothing shallow about Clannad After Story!!! It's a masterpiece with tons of depth to it at ALL times!!!\" they continued.\\n\r\nWell, stereotypical Clannad fanboy/girl, I beg to differ:\\n\\n\r\nHow about After Story's humiliatingly bad portrayal of gang violence? Is that \"deep\"? Or how about its unnecessary focus on characters that aren't even in the second half of the anime and had no reason to be in season two to begin with? Is that not shallow? Perhaps it's the lack on any real chemistry or development between the only two characters that actually matter until very late in the show?\\n\r\nI will eventually get to the good part of the anime (the last third), but for now, lets get through my negatives:\\n\\n\r\nWhat do you think of when you hear the word \"gang\"? The Bloods? The Crips? The Pyros? Maybe the Mafia? What ever you think of, it should definitely involve brutal, merciless people. Basically, heartless thugs who  settle their differences with guns and deal in shady businesses such drug dealing. Clannad After Story offers, well.... a \"different\" take on gang violence. Apparently, in Clannad-world, gangs are just a bunch of dudes who hang out together, sometimes beat each other up, and then run crying to a teenage girl to patch up their wounds. Oh, and the best part? If you deliver a nice, heart-felt speech to them, they all stop fighting and start being friends with each other! Isn't that nice?\\n\\n\r\nOkay, honestly, who the hell could possibly take this arc seriously? Out of all the hilarious examples of Clannad, Kanon, and Air's horribly written, sappy melodrama, this one just might take the cake. THIS. IS. NOT. SAD. Only a complete sap who wants a mindless excuse to cry would be even slightly touched by this kind of emotion porn. Everything is exaggerated to be 10X more dramatic then it would be in real life, nothing about it is emotionally investing, and when you aren't laughing at how this crap is supposed to be sad, you will be bored out of your mind. Never have I seen such a laughable portrayal of something that is a real-life tragedy! Be prepared to deal with this for about 16 episodes before the show actually gets sad.\\n\\n\r\nContributing to the pointlessness and boredom of the first half of After Story: I give you the characters! There are only three characters that matter even slightly in the grand scheme of this anime: Tomoyo, Nagisa (oh god, we will get to her), and a someone I can't reveal due to spoilers (Nagisa's parents are plot devices more then they are characters). And guess what; NONE of them are focused on until about episode 12! The main characters are basically just bystanders or plot devices for story-arcs that revolve around pointless side characters that, as I mentioned before, aren't even in the second half of the anime! These side stories are pointless, forgotten by the plot right after they are completed, and do nothing but waste the time of the viewer.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\n\"Why the hell are the writers trying to develop characters only to write them out of the show?\" You might ask. To answer, they weren't trying to develop characters; they were just giving the viewers some classic Clannad emotion porn. The plot doesn't matter, the characters don't matter, all that matters is making the viewer cry in as cheap a way as possible. Emotionally mature people will see right through this. And as a consequence of ignoring the main characters for so long, there is no development between them what so ever until very late in the anime! After watching Clannad, you could start After Story at about episode 12 and miss nothing relevant, and that is NOT okay!\\n\\n\r\nOh, and that's not even mentioning that one of the only three important characters is an absolute JOKE! I thought they couldn't possibly be serious with this shit, but they certainly were. Ladies and Gentlemen, let me introduce you to Nagisa Furukawa; the anime girl who has single handedly re-written the term \"mary-sue\". They should just go ahead and change the name of the term to \"Furukawa\", because this is some unbelievable stuff right here. She is a shameless, misogynistic idealization of women to the extent of which I've never seen. She is kind, obedient, never questions anyone or anything, has stereotypical ambitions (having a family), and has no discernable personality what so ever. The only thing I can say about this character is that, well, she f*cking exists.  Nagisa Furukawa is the most one-dimensional character I've ever had the misfortune of watching; she's an embodiment of an unrealistic idealization of a \"perfect wife\" rather then a portrayal of a realistic human being, which works against the point of the entire anime. NAGISA FURUKAWA IS AN AWFUL CHARACTER. JUST INDESCRIBABLY AWFUL.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, now that the negatives are out of the way, here are the positives: The last few episodes of Clannad After Story are unique, well written, and offer an unspeakably rare take on high-school romance animes; \"what happens after high school?\" If Clannad has established anything up to this point, it is that Tomoya and Nagisa are in love with each other.  It is at this point that the writing of the show takes a direction it should have had from the start: realism. It abandons all the bullsh*t side stories, supernatural elements, and emotion porn (until it blows it all with a deus-ex machina ending, but I digress). It finally does what I was waiting 1 2/3 seasons for it to do; tell a legitimate tragedy with relatable, heart-wrenching, elements. To give you an idea of how sad and tragic the last few episodes of After Story are, consider that at this point, I saw no way this anime could save itself. I don't even know why I kept watching, I was just looking forward to it to being over. Then, suddenly, I was completely emotionally invested in the characters and the environment to the point that I came damn close to crying. When I say this anime gets sad, I mean it! It took way too long, but After Story eventually developed into a tragic story that simply captures how unfair life really is, and it really is beautiful.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nTo recap:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nThe last and only significant arc is a masterpiece, but the first half of the show is not cohesive and is unbearably sappy/boring for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nBeautiful animation. The settings all look fantastic, but the character designs really bother me. Like I mentioned with Kanon 2006, the female characters have heads that are like 50% eye! Anime characters all have big eyes, but this is ridiculous! It's kind of creepy\u2026\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nA decent opening and a good soundtrack, but it has the worst ending theme of any anime ever created. You will not understand why just by listening to it, but watch the show and you will see what I mean. The voice acting is pretty good in the sub, and it's pretty average in the dub.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nThe only important ones are not focused on nearly as much as they should be. All the pointless side characters spend so much time on screen in the first half of the show, and then they just leave at around the halfway point. I simply don't understand why that is considered okay. I like Tomoyo, but he is a bit bland at times. And Nagisa is AWFUL, as previously mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\r\nOverall, Clannad After Story does not get criticized the way is deserves to. People romanticize about this show as if it is the second coming of Jesus Christ, but the truth is that it's simply unworthy of such lofty praise. Is it still worth a watch? Probably, but certainly not with the expectations of it being one of the greatest anime masterpieces of all time, because it simply isn't in my opinion. I understand the appeal, but it simply wasn't for me.",

            "content": "To be frank, I despised the first season with a passion. For the life of me I couldn\u2019t understand what was so great about it. Yet I still saw the fandom of Clannad everywhere; from the forums to it being favourited on every other profile. I promised to stay away from ~After Story~ after witnessing the fail or rather mediocrity of Clannad. However, seeing the rage of it rising faster and louder with it being currently ranked #1 on the site I caved. Like a kid being peer pressured into smoking I reluctantly watched it. And I\u2019m glad I did. \r\nThis is a continuation ofthe previous series and opens up with the conclusion of Clannad: That Nagisa and Tomoya has finally started dating. But by no means does it stop here. Not many anime, or any stories even, tell a story where the couple are already together and go off from there. Most of the time it\u2019s about how the two love interests get together and fall in love, which is all well and fine but what about after? Do they actually live happily ever after? Are their futures sure to be fine and dandy now that they are together?\\n\\n\r\nI never thought highly of \u2018slice of life\u2019 anime. If I wanted to watch an anime about people\u2019s lives I would just record myself, or better yet - watch Big Brother. Anime is all about the supernatural, fantasy, badass and beautiful characters, action, over the top romances and comedic situations -- the unreal! \\n\\n\r\nOr so I thought. \\n\\n\r\nClannad ~After Story~ proves you don\u2019t need any of these to make a great anime. There\u2019s no world destruction, huge responsibility, convenient coincidences, twists of fate, gore, blood, lovey-dovey romance or any of the usual routine. It\u2019s life. With heart-wrenching drama. With every day real life events that could happen to any of us. And with bittersweet moments.\\n\r\nIt does have some supernatural elements though, but if anything, it adds a touch of realism rather than the opposite. Who\u2019s to say these supernatural mysteries do not take place in real life after all?\\n\\n\r\nThe main cast remains the same, however unlike the first series, ~After Story~ concentrates more on Nagisa and Tomoya, especially in the second half of the series -- one of the many reasons why I enjoyed this. There are also many episodes which are dedicated to characters whom are important and dear to Tomoya and holds value in his life. I also found these a  great joy and equally inspiring. The quality of content in these episodes are much higher than those in the prequel series and of faster pace. They don\u2019t draw out one character\u2019s story for five episodes, but instead packs one or two episodes with such inspiring stories that moves a person emotionally. \\n\r\nThe series has a strong family theme, with Nagisa\u2019s parents being central characters in the story. Tomoya\u2019s father has a bigger part in this series, as we see a progression and revelation between Tomoya and his father. Rarely is there ever a family theme in anime. We hardly ever see parents being shown, never mind being main characters - they really do well in pulling off such a delicate theme. \\n\\n\r\nWhat really made the anime for me was the animation and sound. The animation was so surreal, so vivid it simply made me stare in awe. Key\u2019s animation really impressed me; at times they would they would do sweeping camera follow ups, follow the movement of a flying baseball in slow motion or even chase the movement of a little girl as she runs through a field. The sound was beautiful too. I usually never sit through every single episode\u2019s opening however I could never resist ~After Story\u2019s~ opening. It always sets the mood of the anime and prepares you for what\u2019s to come. Even the opening could twinge your feelings a little. The other themes were wonderful as well. It could go from happy, joyful tunes to melancholic, depressing ones to uplifting and inspirational instrumentals. Nagisa\u2019s Dango Song affected me the most as it would be soft and cute at first then go on to be so painfully uplifting with the use of percussions. \\n\\n\r\nAnother beautiful thing is Nagisa and Tomoya\u2019s relationship. Not once in the entire show are they shown to kiss and even holding hands was a rare see. Yet, their relationship is truly on another level. What they have is a bond so strong and pure that those sort of actions do not need to be shown to tell us that they are undeniably close.\\n\\n\r\nI disliked Clannad. This feeling I cannot change. But Clannad ~After Story~ is a whole other world in anime. It has the art of anime, but has the feel of an old time classic love story of happiness, tragedy and bittersweet revelations. I sought an anime that would make me cry. And sure enough it did. Even the most stone-hearted person would feel a heart aching twinge. Either that or bucket loads of tears. It\u2019s simply beautiful.",

            "content": "If a work of fiction drags its audience into the depths of hell with tragedy, does it retain its artistic merit if the entire experience is nullified by the conclusion?\r\nThis is the principal question faced when attempting to reach a verdict on Clannad: After Story, a work of fiction which has a compelling power to manipulate the emotions of its audience: to make them laugh, to bring them to tears, and to leave their hearts warm with joy. Exploring themes such as redemption and heartbreak, it does many of these things wonderfully, but in desperation to end with a certain tone, it destroys everything itachieves in a single moment.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Story is the continuation of the first series of Clannad, a harem anime which distinguished itself from its contemporaries by treating its subject tactfully and managing to be amusing along the way. This is largely because of the strength of the main protagonist Tomoya Okazaki. In a genre which is infamous for bland main characters with no purpose other than being a body the audience can insert themselves into, Okazaki is a breath of fresh air. He had a back-story, a personality, and a sharp wit. That he spent so much time around women was not surprising, because his character was charismatic and interesting. His relationship with best friend Sunohara was also like a comedy double act, and was genuinely funny to watch.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe female cast, while based on familiar archetypes and not as strong characters as Okazaki, also had more depth than their contemporaries in the genre. They had their own interesting stories and subplots, and most of these were entertaining to watch. It was pretty clear from the offset that Okazaki would end up with Nagisa, and yet these diversions from the main storyline did not feel like distractions. Those characters were important to the story as a whole and their subplots helped to develop them. Afterstory takes things to another level. While the myriad of female characters are still present, it progresses from a harem story to a pure romance. Those female characters from the previous series are retained but they become less like groupies and more like a community. Their relationships with Okazaki and Nagisa are not just on good terms, but they behave like real friends. There is no underlying sense of competition among them for Tomoya\u2019s attention and they interact with the couple cordially.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the presentation in Afterstory is up to the high standards of the first series, with excellent animation and a quality soundtrack. While the art style is primarily a question of taste (though I question the legitimacy of the \u2018bug eye\u2019 critique) there is no doubt that the animation is consistently smooth and polished. It\u2019s not daring or experimental, but it is highly articulate. The soundtrack fits the series wonderfully too, tugging at your heart strings at the appropriate moment, and easing you into laughter when Okazaki and Sunohara are up to their antics. It never errs and even if the same melodies are used time and time again, they never feel repetitive, and they linger on in memory long after the series is over.\\n\\n\r\nIn short much of the original series\u2019 qualities are retained; the most striking difference between the two is the storyline, which in After Story develops into something far grander than its predecessor. While the first series of Clannad works as a piece of entertainment, in Afterstory the saga evolves into a work of art that explores complex themes, principally the theme of redemption. It does not do so with religious imagery or symbolism, but by masterfully crafting a story around the principle itself. Okazaki, as is known from the first series, is dealt a fairly bad hand early in life. Despite these difficulties he strives to help others and eventually manages to take some control of his existence and improve his situation. After Story does this without coming across as moralising or feeling contrived, a difficult task for a story with such themes.  The series also contains a fair amount of tragedy, and this executed masterfully. In one key scene, a blissful moment is thwarted suddenly, quickly spiralling downwards into sorrow. One cannot help but shed a tear for poor Tomoya, whom life had finally begun shining upon. The theme of redemption resurfaces later in the story, where it is played to even greater effect. After reaching a catastrophic low, Okazaki is eventually able to reconcile his relationship with a character he earlier abandoned, in a climactic and touching scene which frames the rest of the series beautifully. This scene is balanced perfectly with the tragic scene mentioned earlier, and the emotional swing between misery and bliss leaves the audience with a feeling bittersweet happiness that every work of fiction strives to instil in its audience accomplished with finesse. Then, in front of our eyes, the beauty of everything before us unravels into something unspeakably ugly.\\n\\n\r\n In a decision which can only be described as madness, the story incorporates another tragedy into the storyline- one which serves no greater artistic purpose or develops Okazaki\u2019s character further. It is merely a tragedy for tragedy\u2019s sake. And at that point, After Story enters into the void of sentimentality and emotional exploitation. One cannot empathise any further with the characters or feel any sorrow. In fact, the most appropriate response is anger. Anger that creating something interesting or making any kind of statement was never the intention of the creators, only to toy with our emotions in the hope it would provide us with some kind of masochistic pleasure. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIt is a plot development from which no story could recover; any meaning one had found in the story until that point is completely lost, and we find ourselves unable to care in the slightest what else might happen to Okazaki. It is perhaps only the desire to get the damned thing over with that compels us to continue with the rest of the series. But continuing the series is an even greater mistake, because the rest of the story serves no purpose other than to add insult to injury.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the second tragedy is nothing more than emotional blackmail, we could say that at least it doesn\u2019t betray the emotions we had felt prior to it. To end on another low point seems meaningless but one still has the beautiful journey reaching it to reflect upon and the opportunity to ponder over its significance. One could satisfy oneself with the fact that while the narrative was obliterated, that such unfortunate double tragedies do occur and that the story is at least \u2018real\u2019. \\n\\n\r\nYet even this is desecrated by the conclusion, in which everything preceding it is rendered moot. We are inexplicably transported to a world where all the terrible events of the story do not occur and Okazaki is able to experience the happy life he had always longed for. This is completely unforgivable. \\n\\n\r\nIf you read any book on writing fiction, there will invariably be a chapter on \u2018bad endings\u2019 and the most prominent of these is \u2018it was all a dream\u2019. The reason being that such endings mean any inconsistencies do not need to be explained, that no real development occurs, and that anything that did occur is now meaningless. Afterstory\u2019s ending is more or less equivalent to this. As the story had been cohesive and logical until this point, it is unlikely they did so to cover up for any errors made previously or to escape any inconsistencies. Clannad\u2019s underlying supernatural themes go some way into explaining how the series ends the way it does, but does nothing to justify why it should end that way. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSuch an ending does have one use though, and that is making a happy ending possible despite the previous plot developments. But why do we necessarily need such a conclusion? There is an implicit point being made that the audience would be unable to cope with a sad ending, making it necessary to conjure a happy ending by any means, even at the expense of the rest of the story. This is nothing less than an insult to the intelligence of the viewer. It is disgraceful. To take the audience into their emotional depths under the pretence that there will be a message or something meaningful behind it, only to betray their sense of empathy by providing an escape no-one who faces such tragedies in the real world shall ever have. Such abuse of emotions in works of fiction can only cause harm. It only leads one to refrain from investing too much feeling into fictional characters, making them hesitant to do so in the future. Worse still, while the audience is able to take in the sadness of the situation the characters experience, the opportunity for contemplation of its wider significance is severed. The consequences mean nothing because the problem has ceased to be a problem.\\n\\n\r\nIn works of fiction, the conclusions you reach are not as important as the journey taken to reach them, since the journey itself is what should lead one to reach those conclusions. In the case of Clannad Afterstory this process has been, not even reversed, but completely ignored. There is no connection between the two events. The journey exists, and it is a wonderful experience. It exhibits a kaleidoscope of human emotions on a powerful level, and does so beautifully. But that journey has no bearing on the conclusions reached either by the plot, or in the mind of the audience.  \\n\\n\r\nHence the dilemma posed in reaching a verdict on this series. Does one simply praise the series for what it does well, criticise its faults and attempt to find a balance between the two? This is the approach one would usually take, but when the conclusion is not only disconnected from the journey but contradicts it entirely, that is something which cannot simply be forgotten. It obliterates all meaning, it excavates all depth, it makes the whole damned thing sum up to nought. Take your wish fulfilment and intellectual depravity if you wish, but I would rather be left in the depths of hell.",

            "content": "~After Story~ is an anime that touches people's souls. I watched it, and was blown away. This was just less than a year ago.\r\nI just spent the last 4 days re-watching Clannad and Clannad ~After Story~.\r\nIt made me recall that the first season was actually good. The first time I saw it, it just paled in comparison to the ending of After Story, giving me false memories of it being bad when I thought back to it.\r\nAfter Story was still even better. The second time through made me admire the pacing the script writers had to go through to achieve this amount of emotional connectionthat other movies and shows can only dream of achieving.\\n\\n\r\nIt took multiple revisions of the same plot until they achieved this precipice. It went through a visual story video game, a manga, and a movie, which I'm sure all went through many revisions of the plot themselves, until they carefully produced this gem of a masterpiece. That's the only thing I can call it. I can't say it's any lower than that. All the extra episodes that aren't necessarily vital to the plot are all needed. It's pacing. You can't attach to characters at such an emotional level in a short amount of time.\\n\\n\r\nI loved After Story. Even though re-watching something will never give me the same experience as the original time, it still was great. I look forward to 30 years in the future, when I probably have all forgotten part of the plot (though, no amount of time will ever make me forget the possibly life changing experience) that I re-watch it again.\\n\\n\r\nI've never experienced anything that touched me like this anime has. People have told me of all kinds of animes that were sad, like Grave of the Fireflies, and such. None of them affected me. I just laughed, and assumed maybe I didn't have a heart since I didn't find anything sad. I mean everything too. Never a movie, book, nor show ever make me feel pity for their real or fictional characters. Everything until Clannad ~After Story~. To be able to create something that can do this deserves a Masterpiece title, because nothing I have encountered has ever done it before.\\n\\n\r\nI also seriously doubt there will anything in a long time that will top After Story's presence. In fact, I doubt that it can ever even be rivaled as an equal in terms of character development.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is simply amazing. If you actually pay attention to some scenes, you'll notice the very high quality background scenery, along with very fluid character animations with great shadow detail.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also one of the strongest points of the anime. The music is amazing and creates the atmosphere in numerous scenes. The ONLY thing I don't like is the happy, cheerful ending song. It only fits a handful of episodes, and completely destroys all mood created in the other episodes. If anything, they should have brought back the Ending of the 1st season for certain episodes. They have songs for everything, for all occasions.\\n\\n\r\nTo say this anime isn't a 10 makes me question someone's soul. Though, I can possibly understand why they might give it a 8 or 9, since everyone is different. Though to give it anything less is probably a troll attempt, or they just didn't finish the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is fantastic. It's not a brain twisting mystery, nor a plot twist filled thrill ride. It instead shows the roots of human mentality. It shows how a person develops.\\n\\n\r\nClannad ~After Story~ is not an anime you should skip on. I watched the anime through a 2nd time with a friend, since he had not seen it before. Mistake. This is best viewed by yourself, or possibly a loved one. Not a buddy.",

            "content": "Clannad ~After Story~ Review\r\nFIRST: Do NOT watch this show or read my review without first watching season one of Clannad. Although it isn't \"necessary,\" watching season one and experiencing the character development throughout it greatly helps you understand the story and value the characters. Plus, it was a pretty damn good show.\r\nStory-10:\r\nReally, the first 8 episodes of After Story are pretty much exactly like what the original Clannad series was like: school life and character arcs while slowly building up Nagisa and Tomoya's relationship. Although these arcs were well written and I enjoyed them thouroughly, they weren't deserving of a 10 rating. However, once youget past the great, but not truly spectacular first 8 eps, the show starts to focus solely on Tomoya and Nagisa. This is where the magic happens and the show began to become my favorite of all time. I was impressed that Clannad managed to make me cry during Fuko's arc (last time I cried was when my grandfather died a few years ago, and that was only a couple tears). But then in the homestretch of Clannad ~After Story~ I found myself bawling my eyes out on numerous occasions. The best word to describe this series is an emotional rollercoaster. It will having you laughing your ass off one minute, and crying like a baby the next. The writing in this anime is unbelievable and it's like the writers developed the perfect bow to pull on your heart strings, timing each event perfectly. The ending is controversial, but I personally loved it.\\n\\n\r\nArt-8:\\n\r\nThe art in After Story is beautiful. The settings are all beautiful, characters look great, and colors are vibrant. However, it is not up to par with some other, more recent, anime I have seen. If I were to review this back when it first came out, the art would get probably a 9, but with anime becoming more visually impressive each year, I just can't say it's distinctively good. It certainly is great though, and besides the fact that many of the characters don't seem to age physically even thou they are old (look the the furikawa family...), there is nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10:\\n\r\nI'm reviewing the dubbed version if anyone is wondering. I found the voice acting to be superb, and can't find any week links in the cast. But what really makes the sound of this anime spectacular is the soundtrack. My only complaint is with the Ed \"Torch\" although it isn't a bad song, it is very upbeat and poppy, thus can easily kill the mood of the more serious episodes if you don't pause the show before the song starts. Overall, most of the tracks used in Clannad are reused in After Story. All the music is perfectly placed with each scene, and i never found myself annoyed with the song choices. Each track helps establish the setting and mood of the scene. By now, everyone should be familiar with the dango song, and thus Nagisas theme. The melody to those songs was stuck in my head since season one. I found it to be a really cute and catchy song. But after watching After Story, I can't help but feel emotional whenever I hear it. The melody is rearranged multiple times to make different variations of the song that fit their specific scenes perfectly. Really, if the only songs in the ost were rearrangements of Nagisas theme, I would still probably give the soundtrack an 8. It really is quite like the series as a whole, sometimes listening to it will make you smile, but other times it may make you tear up a bit. Other highlights are Roaring Tides, The Place Where Wishes Come True, Toki o Kizamu Uta, and Fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-10:\\n\r\nTHE reason why this show is so great. Each character is unique, and although their arcs can sometimes fall into a cliche, the writing still keeps you caring about them. The character development of Tomoya is really the most intriguing aspect. How he deals with all the joys and hardships of life really makes you think about yourself as a person. Where Tomoya was a funny delinquent in Clannad, in After Story you see him mature into an adult, albeit, an adult with a cursed life. I have never been a sucker for romance, but Tomoya and Nagisa's relationship is unlike any I've ever seen. The writers did a brilliant job of making you fall in love with the characters, and feel their emotions as they experience them. I know that what I just wrote isnt very convincing, but that's because I honestly can't explain how this show makes you feel for the lead characters because it is unlike anything I have ever experienced.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10:\\n\r\nThe show made me laugh until my stomach hurt on numerous occasions. It later would flip my stomach upside down and make me depressed as I cried my eyes out. The few plot twists this show has hit you hard (I was spoiled for one of the key events already, and it still left me shocked when it happened). Btw, for your own good: DO NOT GOOGLE ANYTHING ON CLANNAD WHILE WATCHING THIS SHOW. Seriously, just typing in a characters name and looking at the suggestions on google or youtube can spoil major plot events. So now you have been warned. Anyways, this anime is the first to make me actually think about myself as a person, and my future life. The emotional ride the show takes you on is one you will never forget.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nWatch this show. If you haven't already, watch Clannad before Clannad ~After Story~. In short, the emotions this show makes you feel are what set it apart from everything else. This show really can't be described in any other way than by watching it. If you don't think you can handle the emotions that come with this show, do not watch it. But if your someone who thinks anime is meant for action , and not something that can make you laugh, cry, and reflect on your own life, then watch this show, and see your perspective change completely. I have never seen anything like Clannad and After Story, and don't expect to ever again.\\n\\n\r\nThe Verdict:\\n\\n\r\nAn experience unlike anything I've ever seen. An emotional rollercoaster like no other.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+ Toying with your emotions\\n\r\n+ Excellent character development\\n\r\n+ Beautiful story\\n\r\n+ Music is fantastic\\n\r\n+ So much crying...\\n\r\n+ Everything else\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- Torch can really kill the mood\\n\r\n- Not enough cons for me to write about\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Clannad, watch...\\n\r\nKanon/Air/Angel Beats:\\n\r\nAnything by Jun Maeda belongs here because they are so emotional and high in the drama department. Although none of these shows are as good as Clannad, they all do have similar feels and are all good in their own right.\\n\r\nef-Tale of Memories:\\n\r\nDrama filled sadness.\\n\\n\r\n10/10 - Masterpiece",

            "content": "Clannad caught me off guard last year being incredibly different from its predecessors, Air and Kanon 2006. There wasn't so much focus on a story as there was just following the school life of main characters Nagisa and Tomoya, as well as all their friends. When Clannad ended, Clannad After Story was announced. After Story not only guarantees its like its predecessors, but does so in a way that almost makes it excessive and, in the end, shameful. Though this may be the case, After Story is still a superior follow-up to the first season, following a more structured storyline, deepening characters, and still portrayingthat fabulous art and music Key adaptations by KyoAni have become renowned for.\\n\\n\r\nLike the first season, Clannad After Story still showcases the same brilliant art and music. Here we can see KyoAni has realy grasped a hold of their Key-style character designs, having come a long way from when they did Air back in 2005. The designs are aesthetically pleasing while still being a very enhanced degree of cute. The backgrounds, likewise, are very detailed though not meticulously enough that it would come off as gaudy. The town looks like an actual town, with construction sites and familiar pathways, which is excellent as the town itself is a key theme to the story.\\n\\n\r\nMusic provided from the game's original score continues to fit every scene perfectly, and vocal performance quality has skyrocketed with the growing characterization of Nagisa and Tomoya. Akio and Sanae are also well-cast and add to a good lot of scenes and episodes. Unfortunately, this second season has a penchant for insert songs, especially when they're not really called for. In addition, the ending theme \"Torch\" is wholly inappropriate for the gross amount of the episodes. Clannad After Story does top the previous season in making the opening theme even better, a very moving piece, \"Toki wo Kizamu Uta\" sung by Lia, who also sang the OP for Air TV. The accompanying graphics to the opening sequence only heighten the emotional value of the lyrics and the melody. It's easily one of After Story's more notable features.\\n\\n\r\nWith a more emotional opening though, comes a more emotional story. After Story begins by moving beyond the main characters to focus on arcs for smaller roles. These short arcs are actually just as moving as the longer arcs of the first season, providing a surprisingly hefty amount of character development from what were previously background characters and actually invoking a connection to them, which I really have to applaud this series for. Plus, these mini-arcs  buffer well into the main part of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual After Story itself, when it's finally reached, is quite possibly one of the most well-written and developed arcs of any anime I have ever seen. The story moves to a more linear format, focusing on Nagisa and Tomoya. For two characters who got the shaft for development in the first season, they get their development here and in spades. I dare say Tomoya may be the most multi-faceted harem male to ever grace anime.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode flows smoothly into the next in a very consistent format, and every episode brings a new turn or twist, sad or happy, but always dramatic and leaving you wanting more... that is until the last two episodes of the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nIn this final stretch, After Story hits the wall. Following several episodes of dramatic, moving, top-tier material, the storyline, dialogue and characterization all take a major downturn in the form of an unresolved loose end that has followed the series from the start. It feels so incredibly forced when its resolved, and takes away everything gained from the previous episodes, that it feels like a sucker punch both when they tie it up and in how they do it. This is only emphasized by the fact that they had two whole episode spaces to explain the story, but instead decided to end it with a non-consequential side story and a recap.\\n\\n\r\nAs the old saying goes, its not about the destination but the journey. The destination has left a very sour taste in my mouth, leaving me to reflect on how some of Key/Visual Art's more signature elements have only hindered this otherwise phenomenal slice-of-life romance, but it should not discredit from the phenomenal work that the rest of this series was. Trust me, it's worth the ride to swallow the end.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Clannad After Story gets a 9 out of 10.\\n",

            "content": "So it has finally come to this. As I'd watched this anime I felt compelled to review it, heck I've done it in my head many times over. Every time I had a new thought, realization that made it greater in my mind. The reason for doing this is most likely that Clannad succeeded in amplifying every single story arc, making it feel grand, perfect and complete. It was around halfway into After Story that I'd realized I am in way over my head. This does not deserve to be dissected and reviewed like some faulty piece of garbage. No sir.\r\nClannad has grown on memore than I ever thought possible when I played that first episode. Sakura trees, overdramatic (though fabulous) music, deep thoughts, cynical male protagonist right at the start of the anime? I knew it was really popular and loved, but back then I thought I knew just why and my presumptions weren't bright at all.\\n\r\n\"I realize why some people might like this stuff but me? Nah...this is too corny for me...oh well, now that I've started, I'll give it a shot with a few more episodes.\"\\n\r\nBut how the hell could I have known?\\n\\n\r\nIt's a 10, the biggest freakin' 10 I've ever given to anything in my entire life. This is what animes are basically all about. Granted, there are animes that are different, unusual and branch out pretty far from their origin. But essentially what makes them anime, not cartoons or tv shows, a medium that has attracted so many people lately is more or less the same. And Clannad is a conventional anime in that regard. Except it took all that emotion, tranquil slice-of-lifeness, seemingly naive but in fact deep story and made it feel REAL. Every character, every moment, everything that might have put me off at first - though it seemed bland at times - has converted into a great memory, a profound feeling of love. Clannad has stripped off the defense mechanisms I have implanted into my brain as I grew up, thinking I have toughened up, grown smarter, more experienced, when in reality all I did was block off those simple, yet beautiful things and emotions that make life. Because it was easier that way, it left me less vulnerable, rid of any great expectations, making it harder for me to get hurt.\\n\\n\r\nFriendship, falling-in-love, the simple quirks and talents that make us special, the dreams of our childhood and adolescence, all that seems to be labeled as a stupid ideal or taboo today. Should we trivialize those things, take them for granted and treat those moments as such? (This is exactly what Ryou was talking about in Kyou's arc, Alernate World episode) No, instead we should hold them as precious memories, even though they might not be \"Clannad\" for everyone. I was a bit like Nagisa in those years and I regret what I have missed. When I think about it, those years will always hold a special place in my heart even though my childhood and adolescence was short of practically any happy moments. If I had a chance to redo things, I definitely would have acted more like Tomoya, I would've stayed true to some things even when I was ridiculed and insulted by others.\\n\\n\r\nClannad is all too simple. If I tried to describe it, I certainly wouldn't do it any justice. Every aspect of it is combined in a perfect way to create a masterpiece, making it all seem believable. I cried plenty of times, I smiled like I haven't since childhood (I mean those truly happy, altruistic, empathic smiles) because the characters felt completely real. No real way to describe it other than watch it; this is what makes animes great - to an outsider all this would seem pathetic but rather than using complex dialogues or situations to build up characters and explain their morality like in the real movies or TV shows, in animes it's done in a way that's almost magical. Not only that, this anime makes you rethink your life priorities and thus changes it. Yes, this anime is life-changing.\\n\\n\r\nThere, my impression of Clannad. It's the best thing I've watched in my life. Rewatching an anime seemed like a ridiculous thing to do when there are so many good ones around, but I am positive I will rewatch Clannad one day and rejoice as I have on my first watching.",

And so they lived happily ever after\u2026\u201d\r\n\u201cAnd so they lived happily ever after\u2026\u201d\r\n\u201cEver after\u2026\u201d\r\n\u201cAfter\u2026\u201d\r\nWhat really happened to them \u201cafter\u201d? How long did they stay together? What happened to them when they were together?\r\nNo movie or show, let alone an anime, has ever answered these questions.\r\nUntil now.\r\nInstead of presenting a brief five minute epilogue with a J-ballad playing in the background at the end of the first season, Kyoto Animation has given us a 24 episode masterpiece, which is not only a highly satisfactory epilogue, but also a heart wrenching story by itself.\r\nClannad: AS is adirect sequel to the first season, Clannad. Although Clannad: AS is extremely good just as a stand-alone, watching the prequel provides better understanding of their characters and their backgrounds. If you still want to go ahead and watch Clannad: AS directly (although I wouldn\u2019t), then I suggest you give the MAL synopsis for Clannad a quick read before heading onto this one. You follow, Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa, two people who who have vowed to spend their lives together. What you get is the \"after\" of their relationship from Clannad. \\n\\n\r\nClannad: After Story is split into two parts - the side-characters part and the main-characters part. It starts off with three arcs (which make up the first part of the series), lasting a total of eight episodes, dedicated to three of the first season\u2019s recurring characters \u2013 Sunohara, Misae and Yukine. Although these episodes seem to be fan service and lack depth compared to the rest of the series at first glance, they are not. They are there for a purpose and that is to provide us with the characters\u2019 final days in school. Because in this anime, just like real life, their friends move on and the plot provides its absolute and undivided attention to probably my favorite on-screen couple of all time \u2013 Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa.\\n\\n\r\nYou get a visual running commentary of every single event of this seemingly perfect couple, as they struggle, hobble and claw at life to remain together. What you get is the complete journal of events that happen in this couple\u2019s lives, told from Tomoya\u2019s point of view. \\n\\n\r\nYou watch as he tries to overcome whatever life throws at him, in order to be happy, even for just a minute. \\n\r\nYou watch as he bears the brunt of life upon his shoulders and as he shifts through the yin and yang of life.\\n\r\nYou watch as his soul tries to escape the darkness that stalks him like his own shadow. \\n\r\nYou watch as he tries to understand the complexities of the world we live in, during the defining moments of his life.\\n\r\nYou watch, a boy becoming a man.\\n\\n\r\nI will try to condense the analysis of the animation and audio department so as to maximize the space available for story and character analysis.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is just as gorgeous as ever. Movements have been refined and are now much more fluid. The one thing that had improved majorly in this area was the art involved on the characters\u2019 faces. Their emotions are brought out so subtly, but yet so significantly, that it makes you wonder how long they spent trying to get these tiny factors right. For example, when you see Okazaki being calmed down by Nagisa, you can actually watch how his reactions slowly transform from angry to annoyed to a calm state within a couple of seconds. Perfect.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the soundtrack does, there have been no major additions except for the OP and the ED. The OP, Toki wo Kizamu Uta, is one of the best there is and has cemented its position in my favorite OPs of all time at number four. The ED,Torch, is, for the most of the series, a complete misfit. Just when you are about to burst into tears after a devastating episode, the sight of a girl doing high knees followed by the rest of the characters moonwalking across the screen totally ruins the mood.Hard to believe that this inappropriate ED comes from the same singer of the incredible OP, Lia.\\n\\n\r\nCalling this anime an emotional rollercoaster might very well be the understatement of the year. Now, the best way to describe the story's impact is to describe my emotional reactions when I watched the anime. I am a 17 year old guy, with below average sensitivity. Never in my life have I ever shed a tear while watching a show or a move in the theater or on TV. But, this anime wiped the slate clean. I can say, without any regrets or feeling embarrassed that I cried while watching Clannad: AS.  This anime tugs at your heartstrings so hard, that it\u2019s almost inhumane not to tear up. Clannad: AS will rip your heart out and then mend it with sweet words of love and then rip it out again.  During some scenes, I could almost feel my heart crumble inside my chest. That is not to say that this anime contains only sadness. Just when the show pushes you so hard into the well, it pulls you back up just as fast. This series is just raw emotion packed in the form of animated characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe story continues its tie-ins between the real world and the Illusionary World and the supernatural aspect of it plays a much bigger role in Clannad: AS. I won't be going too deep into this as it contains too many spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are crafted to perfection. Thanks to the super job by the animation department, you are now able to completely feel all of the characters' thoughts and feelings, blurring the line between anime and reality. For almost the entire series, I felt exactly how Okazaki felt and thought how Okazaki thought. The innocent and simple way they think was also one of the reasons people love the characters so much. The characters, although grown up, were so gentle at heart. This content and caring way of living lays further emphasis on the purity of the two protagonists. I felt their pain, their sorrow, their despair, their happiness, their pleasures and their excitement. The characters made sure of that. One particular new character bowled me over with his/her charm. The introduction of this soulful, innocent and sincere character was one of the main reasons why I was so moved by this anime.The characters are what strengthened the anime and made a simple tale interesting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is very well done. The casting was perfect and none were out of place. It was all so believable. The entire cast deserves a standing ovation for their power packed performance. The subbing by StaticSubs Eclipse was very neat.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I write a review, I do my best to be unbiased. But sometimes, it's hard not to let your emotions flow when you see an anime that mixes the genres of slice of life, drama and romance so well, that I simply cannot emphasize enough on its ability to make full use of its potential and deliver a story that is sure to make fans of any genre fall in love with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Clannad: After Story is a piece of art and will go down in history as one of the best ever. Even with a near-perfect ending, you\u2019ll be wishing for an After Story to this After Story as it\u2019s really hard to let to let go of the characters that you\u2019ve come to love so much. That\u2019s how hard-hitting and beautiful this anime is. The MAL rating of 10 does not mean an anime is perfect, but it means that the anime is a masterpiece. And that, Clannad: After Story is.\\n\\n\r\n[ THE WRAP-UP ]\\n\r\nClannad: After Story is a an intricately carved insight into the life of characters whose stories \u201cended\u201d last season. The trials and tribulations of the characters successfully bring your emotions to the surface. This emotional bond is further strengthened with a heartbreaking, yet uplifting story, which is guaranteed to drop to your knees and make you jump for joy at the same time. The anime infuses the key elements of its genres (romance, drama, slice of life) and serves a dish that is bound to please even the most stringent of otaku. The animation and soundtrack are exactly what you would expect from KyoAni - inch perfect. While the initial episodes might cause an eyebrow or to raise, rest assured, all suspicions are laid to rest once the series settles down about quarter of the series in. And from then on, the atmosphere of this anime is simply enchanting. This is just one of those rare anime out there that you don't want to miss out on, even if you're not a fan of the genre. Clannad: After Story is a magical journey that will leave you with a lot of memories which will leave you wondering on how YOUR After Story would be.",

            "content": "Magical, one of a kind beauty, executed and told in the most emotional way. Extremely unique and fascinating character development lead through life with its ups and downs. Realistic and tragic tale of love, life and living. A story which has lot to say and even more to offer. Life goes on, people change, but some things always stay the same. Or.. do they?\r\nWhen I first watched Clannad, I thought it was a dull harem which had nothing spectacular to say. When I watched Clannad After Story, I thought it would offer the same dull nothing which Clannad was all about. This actually happened, butonly for a short period of time. Soon after the start, Clannad After Story made some tragic acts and took a different route, completely new and fresh route. This route started a story which would never be forgotten. A story which would burn into the minds of all the people who end up watching the series. The mark it would leave would be a very positive and warm which would be treasured by majority of its viewers. But, in the same time, there would be people who would absolutely hate it and bear a great hatred towards the series and people who made it. \\n\\n\r\nDuring the run, Clannad After Story becomes very realistic. So realistic that it is closer to truth than anything, and the truth is something we can't handle, so we get to see something else instead. A conclusion where the world is something \"better\" and far more \"good\" than what people would expect from reality. A conclusion which makes Clannad After Story a series which gives absolutely no value to the dead nor those who have dealt with the death of someone close. The ending is the prefect way to ruin one of the most impactful series possible, and change ones views about the series completely. It's an immature wish fulfillment ending which is executed solely because of viewers preferences for happiness. This unneeded happy ending destroyes everything the series itself managed to accomplish, but only in terms of the fiction, and not in terms of already experienced emotions, which is why majority of people can keep calling Clannad After Story a masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of people saying that Clannad After Story is the most perfect anime out there. World changing and life changing series which determinates ones humanity and shows how good of a person they are. This is ridiculous. What I, and majority of people seem to get of Clannad After Story, is that there is definitely good people in the world. This is where I stop. After that becomes the conclusion that good stuff happen to good people. There are miracles in the world and these miracles happen and make people happy. What Clannad After Story really makes is not a miracle, it is a cop-out with a lot of foreseeing. One very popular topic about the ending is the use of deus ex machina, which frankly, doesn't even matter. The trope used there is irrelevant since tropes aren't defining quality. The ending is nothing but a second change given in a situation where you don't fucking need a second change. You are supposed to live like the rest of us, not to fucking miraculously get back the things that can't be gotten back. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, I loved Clannad After Story, and that's why I hate it.",

            "content": "*This contains at least one major spoiler because it's something I feel the need to state, so be wary. Some very minor spoilers might be unavoidable too.\r\n- - -\r\nThe mighty Clannad After Story. One of the most highly praised anime in existence. Is it worth the praise? Is it really that good? No.\r\nI've heard that this anime is of the highest quality with one of the most heartbreaking stories ever written. Hahaha, no. There are so many problems with this anime that the bad overshines the few goods.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nJust like the first season, the first half of the second season tried too hard to forceemotions with pointless arcs that served no use for the second half, where the main part of the story was. It was still a bad mash up of romance, drama, slice-of-life, and comedy. It still didn't know what it was trying to be until the second half where the story finally started going in a clear direction. But a lot of problems came out of this too. Mainly Nagisa (more detail in the character section). After it started going in this direction, it was just boring until the final arc. The last arc is by far the best part of the show. But then they pulled the worst bullshit with the last episode. I know it was kind of built up throughout the show with those balls of light, but it literally rendered the entire season pointless. The final episode was something they cranked out of their asshole at the last second in an attempt to make everything good and dandy. A good last arc ruined.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nIt was definitely an improvement from the first season, but I still couldn't take any of the girl characters seriously with the stupid fucking bug eyes. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nIt was okay.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nIn the first season, over half of the cast was filled with useless one dimensional characters. But there were some good ones. Half way through season two, all of the likeable side characters were gone. The only characters left were Nagisa and Okazaki. I hate Nagisa with a passion. She's a terrible, one-dimensional, annoying character that completely detached me emotionally from the story. I literally stopped thinking of her as a person as some point. Okazaki, however, had pretty good character development and I actually had some emotional connection to his problems. But, I felt whatever potential the show had as a drama was completely ruined by Nagisa. She literally made me not care. Nagisa's parents were the only other relevant characters (until the last arc) and are pretty good characters but they were there more to progress/extend the plot than anything to actually be characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (Huge Spoiler here): 4/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed the first half as much as the first season of Clannad, so not that much. I was bored until the last arc. There was one part where I was seriously sad in the story: I noticed that the art was  better so I googled \"Nagisa's eyes\" to compare the horrendous eyes of the first season to the second to see if they were any better (I didn't know whether they were or whether I was just getting used to them) and the search came up with a youtube video titled \"Nagisa Died.\" I was mad and upset because now I wouldn't be as happy when I saw Nagisa in the anime. Oh, I stilled cheered when the moment came, but not as much as I would've liked to. But let me tell you, I'm very glad she died. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\n-Pointless first half, same problems as first season\\n\r\n-Boring until last arc\\n\r\n-God awful final episode\\n\r\n-Nagisa\\n\r\n-Most likeable characters were gone\\n\\n\r\n+Good last arc\\n\r\n+Nagisa died\\n\r\n+Okazaki's character development\\n",

            "content": "Our life is like a cycle, sometimes we are above and sometimes we are under\r\nClannad ~After Story~ is a sequel from Clannad and an adaptation from the original Visual Novel created by KEY. The anime often heard in my ear as one of the best anime. I always ask myself, ''Why? Why Clannad very famous? Is it really that good?\". But now, I know something special is exist in this story.\r\nIf you looked Clannad AS, there is not much to say about the plot. It told us a tale of a man that suffer the difficulties of living, and how he pass through it.In the early episode, the storytelling almost looks same like the first season described as not too essential.  But after that, the story run into one focused and unique storytelling.One of the other major fruitfulness is the story managed to wrap all of the mixed feelings that are not rigid and suitable with the story.  There are various moral lessons we can learn, one of them is  \"even though you've had a painful past, you can overcome it by looking into the future with the ones you love\", and many moral lessons includes in this story, it is the most powerful aspect of the story. The pacing it's relatively slow but fit with this kind of settings. Next, the ending, the most widely criticized part of Clannad After Story is its deus ex machina ending, it still abstract to understandable if the viewers don't understand the mysteries that lurked, which can bring a little bit confusion to the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is wonderful, set in a beautiful world, have a great background details and colorful art. Although I know there is many people disliked the character big eyes design, but it really needs praise for the breathtaking environment. The sound settings are well-matched with the feeling of the story, the OP theme song \"Toki wo Kizamu Uta (\u6642\u3092\u523b\u3080\u5504)\" by Lia really represents the expression of the story. The seiyuu did a wonderful job in bringing such character to the screen.\\n\\n\r\nI almost shocked and silent, It's just so perfect & unmatchable. The main character grows to more mature. Every character has their proper development & plays their roles well. There is a process and the results come. It is one of the deepest and detail character development I ever saw. \\n\\n\r\nThere goes Clannad After Story, a story that made almost all of its audience draw their tears in their eyes. If you looking an anime that succeeds both in their perfect character development and deep plot, Clannad After Story is the answer. \\n\\n",

            "content": "\"So could these lights be shadows of something? If they are shadows, their bodies must exist somewhere else. Could things that exist somewhere else in some other world be creating these lights?\"\r\nClannad After Story, sequel to another brilliant project of Key visual arts, brings you the magic of what a story can hold. It has the old high school romance, the friends, the drama, but it's not afraid and most certainly not attempting to hide it's supernatural aspect. You won't feel intact with the beauty of what Clannad has to offer if you don't realize the 'magic' behind it all. It brings life, and wondersto what life itself actually is. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10 - Proceeding from Clannad's last season, we have our beloved Nagisa and Tomoya, who are now thankfully a couple to die for. Once the first portion of the show is over, it enters into what we've been waiting for, the focus on the two MC's, and how they're now involved with each others futures, and the events, or drama that happens within it. Friends seem almost non-existent when you are in love, all your mind can think about are images of that person's face, the one you know you can't live without. Okazaki and Nagisa went one way, and all of their fellow classmates soon depart another. Whether you were a Nagisa fan from the beginning or not the story almost twists you into having a bit of sympathy in the least, and I feel if a writer is able to do something like that, then round up the applauses because damn am I impressed! \\n\\n\r\nIt's a vast universe, when you lock souls with that other, it almost seems like a miracle. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10 - From the unique visuals used for the toy robot and the Illusionary girl, to the mere fluidity in Tomoyo's 1,000 kick combo! I have never been less than impressed when it comes to a Key production. The opening songs are beautiful in both art and sound and I can't get enough of the foreshadowing. Kyoto's visual arts know when to emphasize a scene of significance; the baseball soaring through the air, it turns into a close-up, spinning ever so slowly, and then we return to the story of the Illusionary girl, and the field which constantly emits these orbs of light, floating, as if the world they're in, has it's own sort of weather. The atmosphere of Clannad is what pulls one into the anime, almost like you're experiencing it all as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 - Again, the opening songs for the prequel and Clannad AS itself were both very pleasing to the ears, but had a kind of melancholic tone, this only grows stronger as you progress through the series because you then are able to reflect on all the characters as you see the images pass by. The sound effects for everything else aren't much to write home about but the soundtrack is quite amazing! The synchronization of the bgm and the scene at hand could be the reason you find yourself bawling or tearing up on the side because of how heavy it all feels at once. I have no words for how sad one single soundtrack could make you feel. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10 - The idiot, the genius, the tsundere, the tomboy, the shy girl, the airhead, the goofball. All of these generic characters in one show, but how do they manage to be so entertaining and get them spot-on? Because it's just done well, and isn't boring, or frustrating and repititive. The characters mingle with each other like how they're suppose to and nothing seems out of place, or unordinary. Aside from Fuko. Now that relationships have developed and it's almost time for graduation, the 'friends' almost seem like a family. \\n\\n\r\nDango Dai kazoku!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 - Never will I forget such a series, and I will continue to recommend it as long as I keep interest in anime, and I don't plan on abandoning it anytime soon. Let's hope it sticks, but Clannad can and WILL teach you a few things about life, it isn't easy but miracles do happen, so don't let go of that strand of hope, and keep on pushing for what it is you seek. It'll all be worth it! Just like an alternate world, there are always alternative options, don't fret, keep your eyes on the prize! As they say.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Disclaimer 1: Please excuse some colorful language that may or may not have found its way into this review.\r\nDisclaimer 2: This review is NOT free of spoilers, so read at your own risk.\r\nCLANNAD: Afterstory Review\r\nPros:\r\n-The animation is still great. Yeah.\r\n-Extra focus on characterization. For some people. For the rest, it kind of sucks, but for Akio, Sanae, Yoshino, Tomoya and Nagisa it's great.\r\n-More Tomoya! Afterstory builds up on Tomoya's development from the first season and kicks it into overdrive. We see him struggle to grow up, enter society, become a man, care for his family, etc etc. His character progression is solid and moves ata good pace. By the end he looks and acts like an adult(except when he kind of kills his kid, but yeah), albeit a unique one forged by his circumstances. He and his journey are the main reason the story holds up as well it does.\\n\\n\r\n-Nagisa is a person! Not really, but kinda. Over the sacrifices of literally ALL of the supporting cast excluding her parents, Nagisa is given some actual characterization and even, dare I say it, growth. Even her death, perhaps meant to be nothing more than a tearjerker, was an important milestone in Tomoya's development. It's a shame and yet not that she died. On one hand, she was just beginning to feel like a real person. On the other, the show should not have waited until episode 16 of the second season to give their female lead a personality.\\n\\n\r\n-Ignore stuff, it helps. I have found that I cannot remember much before episode 9 or so. That's fine, because what I do remember of them isn't amazing. They weren't bad (except the whole cat/boy thing, WTF) but they didn't really add much as the show was picking up speed.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, I found that my view of the show rose by several orders of magnitude if I ignored the last couple episodes. I will talk about those in the cons section, but the point is that if the show ended on episode 21-22, it would be fucking amazing.\\n\\n\r\n-Tomoya(again). Continuing from the previous point, I like to think that the show ended on episode 21-22 because it is by that point that Tomoya has gone full circle, he has grown beyond a teenager, beyond a boy struggling to be a man, has grown past most of his grief, and is ready to live his life for his daughter despite his major fuck-up earlier. That right there, was a perfect moment to end it. The show's focus on the importance of family would have been perfectly encapsulated.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, more tearjerkers were needed so Ushio dies in what has to be the most retarded and forced way in history but waaaaait it doesn't matter because magical power of happiness double time travel happens. Yay for finales.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, ignoring the last episode actually makes me think that the show ended on a great way that surprised me a lot, and managed to pass on a real world message through an entertaining medium and likable characters.\\n\\n\r\n-Akio is awesome. Well, he is.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\r\n-Disappearance of the supporting cast. I get what Afterstory was going for. The focus on Nagisa and Tomoya's family was actually pretty good, all things considered, but all other characters that were in every episode of CLANNAD literally dissapeared and are seen maybe twice (if at all) throughout all of Afterstory. Sunohara's absence was especially jarring, considering he was (supposed to be) Okazaki's best friend.\\n\\n\r\n-The first 8-9 episodes. As I said earlier, they weren't bad, they felt really separate from the rest of the show, and not in a good way. Oh, that reminds me:\\n\\n\r\n-The cat-boy bestiality case. Seriously. Misae is hot and if I were a cat turned into a boy I'd wanna bang her too but what the actual f-.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads me to:\\n\r\n-The supernatural elements/other world storyline. F- this. F- this sideways with a rusty spoon. Whoever decided it was a good idea to add the supernatural stuff and then give exactly fuckall explanation for them, just so he could undo two seasons' worth of character development should go eat a pile of dog shit and then apologize to every single CLANNAD fan in existence, personally.\\n\r\nThe supernatural elements were stupid as f-, the other world storyline was boring and it was time/money that could have been invested better, and the final episode fucking ruins fucking everything by undoing anything of note that ever happened, BUT ONLY THE SAD STUFF, so that the perfect happy ending can be achieved in a show that was poised to show that even though life and reality are both bitches, happiness can be achieved if you try your best for the people closest to you.\\n\\n\r\nAll the better, then, that the last episode doesn't exist for me. Boy, I'd be mad as balls if it did.\\n\\n\r\n-The copout regarding Tomoya's dad. Now, I'll admit that I kinda sorta liked the resolution of Tomoya and his dad seeing eye to eye and his dad finally returning home as a bent but not completely broken man, but I didn't like how it came to be.\\n\r\nIt was one convenient thing after another, in a series of forced coincidences that only make me roll my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, it felt like a total waste of the subtle tension that the first season had created. It felt like the first season wove a silk thread, and then the second season came and beat it to death with a hammer, yelling all the while \"IT'S FINE BECAUSE HE DID IT ALL FOR YOU AND YOU'RE THE SAME SO YOU SHOULD GET IT, RIGHT? RIGHT?!? I CAN'T HEAR OVER HOW NOTHING IN THE PAST MATTERS, SPEAK UP.\"\\n\\n\r\nIt's all incredibly convenient and in such a way as to dissolve the rift in the least confrontational way possible. Which can work, I suppose, but it's an incredible waste.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, I will have to disagree with people on this site (and the show itself) who think that Tomoya and his dad are the same. True, both are understandable in their actions considering the loves of their lives died, and I don't think you people are giving enough credit to the pits of despair such a sudden loss can lead some people to.\\n\\n\r\nStill, Tomoya gave Ushio to Akio and Sanae for five years. While a terrible thing to do as a father, it was actually the better choice. Akio and Sanae are both model, loving parents who did a great job raising Ushio for her first 5 years, much better than a grief stricken Tomoya would have done. Tomoya's father tried to do it, he tried his best to go at it alone, and he failed. Even unconsciously, Tomoya took the best possible decision in those circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nBtw, while I can buy the reconciliation once Tomoya knows what his father went through, I can't quite buy him thinking that Okazaki senior was a great father. We're seeing flashes of him being a great father through Tomoya's memories from when he was little but CLANNAD and Afterstory have no such examples, and in fact it is heavily implied that this has been the case for years.\\n\\n\r\nSo no, I'm not quite sold there. It was a very dissapointing copout.\\n\\n\r\n-I think there were more, but I can't remember them right now.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\\n\r\nMy rating depends on what I choose to do with the final episode.\\n\r\nIf I ignore it, it is a successful tale of a boy growing into a man that showcases the importance of family and learning to look at the positives in one's life. Yes it could have been better and it did several things wrong, but in the end Tomoya's journey is too well-crafted to be dragged down, and the supporting cast of Afterstory are all solid. Well worth an 8/10 rating.\\n\\n\r\nIf I don't ignore the final episode, it is all of the above, only smashed into pieces and then pissed upon for the sake of a classic happy ending whose avoidance was exactly the reason the show was any good through the use of unexplained, retarded plot devices.\\n\r\nIn which case, not even Tomoya's journey could save the rating since it is basically invalidated (IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU LEARN IN LIFE, KIDS. ALL SAD THINGS GO AWAY THROUGH HAPPINESS LIGHT MAGIC TIME TRAVEL). In which case, a 5/10 would be generous.\\n\r\nFor the sake of rating, I will just give it a 6.\\n\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr: CLANNAD/CLANNAD Afterstory are well worth a watch, though far, far from perfect.",

            "content": "Clannad After Story is a beautiful story about the continuing and blossoming relationship of two of the main characters from the first season of Clannad, Tomoya and Nagisa. \r\nThe plot is a bit more mature and serious, as most of the story does not take place in high school anymore, but instead revolves around first, some of the problems of those still close to Nagisa and Tomoya while still in school, but from there the story shifts into mostly just Nagisa and Tomoya. Yet again, the story takes a more serious turn as it goes on about Tomoya's strained relationship with his father, Nagisa's failinghealth and her need to stay out of school for long periods of time, Tomoya out and working and living on his own and their relationship together, as it moves beyond boyfriend and girlfriend and goes into them creating their own home and family together. \\n\\n\r\nClannad After Story touches on many serious matters such as drugs, alcohol, gambling, pregnancy, abortion, death, neglect, depression, parenting and much more, so be prepared to fall in love all over again and have your emotions run wild.\\n\\n\r\nSo far I love the story, but it is not over, so it might get changed to a 10 once the ending has completed.",

            "content": "\"Sanae told me where it was okay to cry. It was in the bathroom and in daddy's arms.\"\r\nBoth Clannad and Clannad: After Story are amazing animes (and if you haven't watched Clannad and are planning to watch After Story first, make a U turn and rethink that... seriously), however none is flawless. For this review, I'll present, in the first place, the positive aspects of each category and then proceed to present the negative ones. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nClannad:After Story proceeds with Clannad's story and does a wonderful job at that. What makes this story so good is that it's a slice of life tale of forgivenessand hope which deals with important matters such as the responsibility one gains while growing up, recovering from something and moving on, etc. The story doesn't move forward at a fast pace, dedicating the needed time to each scene and not rushing everything. \\n\r\nNow, for the negatives aspects, the first episodes/arcs presented can be seen as instruments to diminish the anime's consistency and quality, since they're not essential to the outcome. I personally liked them a lot, though, and think that they're good to clear your head before getting to the heavy stuff (but that might be just my love for Sunohara talking). Additionally, the overly dramatized situations and the fantasy part might lead to the loss of the sense of reality that the anime plans to achieve. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is amazing. It's easy to understand what each character is feeling based on their expressions and the way the colors and lights are manipulated in the surreal world is very impressive.\\n\r\nThe only downside to the art is that the characters don't seem to get older physically. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe voices of the characters match with their personality and are easily distinguished. \\n\r\nHowever, even though the opening theme is very versatile and helps setting the mood for every episode, the ending theme has the opposite effect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters are very human, in other words, their personalities are compatible with the ones that the people we know have and it's easy to create a connection with them and like them.\\n\r\nThe \"Character\" category is the one who has the lowest score because it sins in the development of Nagisa in contradiction to the development of Tomoya, which makes their relationship seem a bit immature. Even more, on the second half of the anime, the only secondary characters which are shown and which take any part in the action are Sanae and Akio, so if one of your favorite characters is from the \"school gang\", I'm sorry to disappoint you, but you won't be seeing them for a while.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching this anime because it has a little bit of everything, it makes you think about your own future and makes you see people in a different way, which will make you try to understand their opinions and struggles.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nIf you love slice of life animes and are ready to have some strong feelings for fictional characters, this is the anime for you!",

IS THAT PISS?\"\r\nNo wait wrong situation, oh there comes a time in every anime fan's life where they find that 1 show that they know is better than the rest. They know it's the best they ever seen and that nothing will top it. I'm talking about the day where they find the best show they'v ever seen. To me that moment occurred after i finished watching clannad after story last year, \r\nAnd you know what I've watched a large amount of shows almost all of themgreat since then, and still none of them have come close to topping this show.\\n\\n\r\nNow first thing you should know is that this show is a sequel to a great not perfect but great show called clannad (duuuuuuurrrr) and the only thing people may be dissapointed about this sequel is that almost all the characters are pretty much absent in after story, they will be there in the start but the story focuses on tomoya and nagisa's lifes after school ends and goes as far in time for more than a decade\\n\\n\r\nThe serise(not to sound cliche and full of myself) the show is legitimately inspirational, after watching this show i find it much less than a coincidence that  i started to work harder and enjoy life more. \\n\\n\r\nThe show really shows the hardships tomoya endures due to him being a flunk at school and you see how that affects him as his life goes on but you also see how he pushes through it thanks to the help of nagisa and how they as a couple push through for better or for worse. It's really handled beautifully, The characters of tomoya and nagisa are some of the best characters out here, not only are they likable and relate-able but you don't have a hard time believing there's people out there like them, they aren't perfect people either, like all humans they have flaws to them.\\n\\n\r\nFor a show that really gets drama down perfectly the show can also be very funny and even kinda crazy at times, mainly between the relationship between akio-san and tomoya, when they are both onscreen at once you can expect things to get funny but the bets part is that the relationship is more than comedy. Their relationship really builds and they do seem like father and son as things become much more bleaker as the series goes on(without spoiling it, 3/3 part of the show GET TISSUES)\\n\\n\r\nnow i've talked about all the things that make the 2nd and 3rd part of this show so amazing but the 1st part also is handled very nicely, its still in school from the first season and they end up at least giving a episode to each character and you learn that these side charecters really have stories to tell. You see exactly why sunahora and tomoya were friends and stuff like that, none of them have any big twists like the first season did but they are handled very well and these characters which you may have not cared to much for turn out to be extremely likable characters\\n\\n\r\nSo if your still reading this show you should be able to tell by now, I LOVE THIS SHOW, everyone needs to see it, You didn't like the 1st season? Watch it, don't like moe? still watch this. This is a show you need to see. Saying i highly recommend this is a understatement. I'm not ordering you, i'm begging you to go watch this cause everyone should feel the same feeling i got while watching this show. I feel bad when i see someone who hasn't given this show a try, regardless of how meh the show seems initially don't pass this up. This show is one of a kind. As i stated before i BEG you to watch it",

            "content": "WARNING: THIS REVIEW IS NOT FRIENDLY. IT'S LONG, DETAILED AND NOT FOR AVERAGE VIEWERS OR BEGINNER ENTHUSIASTS.\r\nBut don't worry, no bashing and all my critiques are not biased.\r\nReason why I give Clannad AS a 9.\r\nIt deserves it and I'm magnanimous to all the series that impresses me.  I may even be horribly biased against shoujo and school animes generally due to their lack of creativity but I must admit that Clannad AS has broken those genre's ingrained weaknesses and made me utter a big \u201cfinally!\u201d\r\nThe line that summarizes everything: It gets better.\r\nClannad AS is a major leap not just from its prequel but drasticimprovement is evident in the story's progression. \u201cFinally,\u201d it has:\\n\\n\r\n1.Achieved a decent amount of realism.\\n\r\n2.Fixed all its weaknesses.\\n\r\n3.Portrayed an unconventional story in optimum aesthetics\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, when I remember the first season of Clannad I am reminded of the repetitive plots and endless cycles of crying and encouragement. It was pretty weak and it significantly lowered my expectation for its sequel. However, watching After Story made me swallow skepticism and squeezed a few drops of tears from me.\\n\\n\r\nThe start of the series is pretty much the same as the composition its prequel. Nothing can be said much except that scenes are dealt with more cinematic effects and the history of many characters are finally tackled. There is enough depth overall, but its distributed unevenly among those little arcs. Satisfying, bittersweet at some points, the start can be described as an \u201cimproved first season,\u201d no notable changes nor twists or thoughts to be pondered over.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, halfway the series, it's gets really better. The change of direction in the story is very inviting for fresh possibilities. Besides delivering the potentials the plot shift has given, it actually brought out the potentials that wasn't touched by the first season and the earlier parts. Clannad AS finally stepped out its shell and show that it can impact people despite its simple story: It touched family, narrated life in a very artistic way and impacted viewers with thoughts and concepts our world, or other worlds may have.\\n\\n\r\nIn tapping its potential, Clannad AS used improved everything it can work on. First is its art and music. Art has been consistent all throughout the series and the best quality a series of this time can have, I can  say that it has the best facial expressions I have seen in anime so far. It's way of showing how eyes water, lips pout or how character say what they feel is detailed, down to earth enough to be appropriate for the overall mood of the series, but powerful and provoking visually.\\n\\n\r\nThe same couldn't be said about music, the earlier part is full of the recycled music that is predictable with certain scenes that come, but the later part give better background music that we've never heard before in the series. And did I already mention that the opening song is one of the best I have seen? It's a shame to dismiss such a wonderful song. The ending is good as well, jolly and befitting the immediate mood of the story, though it may be a bit inappropriate for some story parts later on.\\n\\n\r\nAside from wonderful presentation, the theme of family, barely tackled well initially, is expanded and handled very well by Tomoya's character developent. It's surprising to see the central character learn, mature and change from the way things started. School life is over, the city is changing, everybody's changing and things cannot be always what they are. Life can be both fantastic harsh. Tomoyo's development is remarkable and a bit unconventional considering that a main character with his kind of role has barely or has never been tackled before. \\n\\n\r\nHis relationship with Nagisa, in which the series focuses after a long start, turns out to be one of the best handled in anime. No over the top lines, natural conversations and not focused on romantic or sexual themes. It was refreshing to see a form of love that friendly and at the same time appealing to general viewers yet retains a decent amount of depth. Simple gestures, from holding hands to smiles express enough message to be understood and felt. It's unconventional indeed from the usual stories of suffering together, staying together or breaking up, but not far away, understandable and fitting to a tale of life's dramas.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, probably one of the best assets of Clannad AS, unseen in the majority of animes where they are badly needed is the absence of unnecessary objectification; In layman's term, fanservice. The total lack of fanservice solidifies its family theme and makes the viewers see love as genuine as ever. It preserves the very captivating and emotionally stirring visuals, also, breaking the perceived image of moe animation as full of loli fanservice. \\n\\n\r\nI think what make Clannad AS powerful is that it has shown the usual themes of life, family and maturity in a very down to earth way yet dealt with some unusual metaphors and concepts. I am given a lighthearted way of viewing the Clannad universe with fantasy and philosophical understones. Beautiful and evoking, simple but with impact. Excellent, excellent work of its genre, probably one of the best animes of its kind.\\n\\n\r\nReason why it doesn't deserve a perfect score:\\n\\n\r\nOr why it may even receive drastically lower ratings from critics and biased reviewers- Nagisa Furukawa's character, predictability of overreaction and the amount of realism it has. I'll elaborate Clannad AS' weaknesses from the major to the minor.\\n\\n\r\nIn fiction jargon Nagisa is a borderline Mary Sue, a little more and she'll fall off the cliff as a flat character. Good thing she didn't for she wasn't dragging everyone down with her like that of the first season and the series was relatively excellent to save her. Her development, necessary for her role, is significantly mediocre compared to Tomoya's.  She clearly successful of being adorable, but sick girl archetypes need more backbone; she gets all the good treatment from her family and friends so it's hard to sympathize with her. There isn't much strength in her because all she does is do things in a right way,  in a manner that's more favorable to her aesthetics than to the overall drama of the series itself. To shorten the long story; she doesn't receive any improvement at all. Sure, she's as \u201ccute\u201d as ever, but she doesn't get better.\\n\\n\r\nThe second reason, probably differs greatly from each's standard, is overreaction. It's pretty plain predictable when the character would break down in tears and cry; that's not really bad and very natural especially if it's in its real tearjerker situations. The problem is when you're irked to its context that every character cries the same way in pretty minor grievances. Clannad is a mild drama*, and the predictable overreaction diminishes the dramatic effect some of its scenes badly need. But again, as the review's tagline says; It gets better, very much.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, though very very minor, Clannad universe remains unchanged. Clannad universe is a world where the majority of characters act either cute or cool in shoujo standard, very idealized and arguably generic. It doesn't mean that the characters are flat and poor, it's just that it's the Clannad universe- a  setting which many loves.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Words:\\n\\n\r\nThough it has a share of flaws, Clannad After Story is an anime to be recommended to all viewers, from shounen fans to fellow critics. It deserves acknowledgment and appreciation in a fair perspective. ** I say it is a beautiful story, a good experience and a wonderful piece of work worth watching.\\n\\n\r\nThoughts to ponder about:\\n\r\nIs Clannad AS remarkable on its own or just because it is a big leap from its prequel?\\n\\n\r\nNotes:\\n\\n\r\n*In the review's personal spectrum, mild drama is anything that involves everyday life while heavy drama involves things like war, politics, murder or saving the world. And also, note being a dramatic series is not the same as being a drama series. Mild drama doesn't mean it's less deep than heavy drama. Dragon Ball and TTGL pretty dramatic, but hell not of drama series. Clannad AS is not dramatic, but instead, melodramatic in mood yet a drama series.\\n\\n\r\n** A true critic should know the eyes of all kinds of viewers, not just that of oneself that prioritized one's own standard by favoring certain elements and dismissing what he/she doesn't like personally. A true critic(for me) knows that there are more good anime than bad ones, but can strongly defend the possibility that excellent ones are rarer than what the normal audience think.",

            "content": "There are some animes that uplift us, and constantly make us laugh and smile each and every episode. There are animes that sadden us, show us a world where some people tried their best but didn't quite have the ability to make their dreams come true.\r\nThen there is Clannad After Story, which seams together these two extremely emotional qualities flawlessly and presents us with something truly unique and amazing. It is a very real story, beautiful in its simplicity yet powerful with its bold emotions. It will send chills down your spine in the way it is able to show the biggest wonders within thesmallest events. Clannad After Story is truly a treat, one that you will never forget.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI do not want to spoil a moment of this compelling story for you, but essentially this is the story of the beginnings and life of a family. So simple, yet the slow and emotional way in which it is presented is truly amazing to watch. The characters and music combine with the story and make its presentation even more astounding and emotional.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely love this art style. The animators will take their time to highlight specific things in a scene, perhaps the wind carrying sakura petals or the gaze of a robot lost in a desolate world. I am big on eye styles if you know me well, and Clannad does not fail to deliver. The eyes are unique and refreshing, yet they completely work for the characters.\\n\r\nI will say that the Clannad team does tend to \"recycle\" their clips a lot, and they re-use many scenes that have already been used. It was never a problem for me however, and I never seemed to notice during each episode. Each clip of animation has a visible amount of dedication put into it, and it pays off.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI would say this is where Clannad truly shines, but to be honest, it shines everywhere, and the soundtrack is no exception. Honestly, this is one of the most amazing anime soundtracks I have ever heard. Shinji Orito and gang have created a moving soundtrack to match the emotions of the anime perfectly. Without these songs, the anime would only be half as good as I believe it is. I urge you to listen to the songs carefully and let yourself be absorbed into the emotions of the anime, and listening to these songs later will immediately bring to mind these emotions that our characters were feeling at the time. Fabulous, fabulous job to the music team.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnother 10, yes, but I am sure you will agree with me on this one. There is Tomoya, the main character, who changes dramatically over the course of After Story. There is Nagisa, Tomoya's wife, who is kind, gentle, and sometimes a bit incapable of handling things herself. There is Kyou (yay Kyou fanboy here), the aggresive tsundere of the group who is outgoing, kind, and well... intolerable of stupidity. There is Tomoyo, very similar to Kyou but with ambitions and a steady path she sees for herself.\\n\r\nThese and many other characters make this story a must-see. There is a character for everyone to love and be attached to; in fact I find myself loving every single character. (Except Fuuko, who I must add, was put in this anime a bit too much.) Overall, amazing cast, and voice acting is also very solid.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI always hate to give a review all 10's, because it seriously looks like I'm a fanboy of Clannad. But thinking back on the series, it deserves nothing less. All the elements that make up an anime mesh perfectly for Clannad After Story, and it is truly a treat to watch. I enjoyed every second of this anime, and came close to crying (which I have never done watching an anime).\\n\r\nI knew then that Clannad After Story was something special, something that draws the emotion from everyone's hearts and connects you to the story in one way or another. This is something you cannot miss.",

            "content": "I'll admit that \"Clannad\"/ \"Clannad: After Story\" was my first, and probably last venture into the anime \"slice of life\" genre. I know this genre can be done well, but given the esteem that it appears most viewers hold for Clannad I don't expect to find any better. My problem with this series is that it starts out asking you to suspend your disbelief and ends up asking you to just lower your standards.\r\nWhat I mean by this is that is starts out with things like : a girl has a pet boar, comatose girl's spirit walks among the living, etc. which to me addedto the flavor of the story. Then there are the improbable/ mundane scenarios peppered throughout the first series that we all tolerate, because we're invested in the characters; an example from the first series Kotomi being allowed to live on her own.  But once all the supporting characters are gone/ all their individual sob stories are addressed or resolved and school is over what are we left with? \\n\\n\r\nTomoya's puritanical (and hence) underdeveloped relationship with his generic/ underdeveloped girlfriend. I managed, bordering on liked, the first season, because there were plenty of distractions from this, and it was high school so Tomoya and Nagisa's relationship, which wasn't as prevalent, came off as being unlikely instead of just flat out impossible, which is what happened/ ruined the after story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I can't understand is who would be offended by a- committed couple kissing, sharing a single bed (I mean this isn't the 1950's.) If you want to pretend that street gangs don't deal in illegal weapons and illicit substances and aren't morally reprehensible, fine. But crying in someone's arms isn't romance. The definition (in case you were wondering): a feeling of excitement and mystery associated with love. Where was the mystery, where was the excitement? Love (according to the triangular theory of it) is composed of passion, intimacy, and commitment. There wasn't any passion, there wasn't any physical intimacy. So to recap this is a romance without romance, and a slice of life where young individuals experience no passions (physical or otherwise,) and display little to no desire for independence.\\n\\n\r\nNow I'm not saying in order for the relationship to be believable or enjoyable the writers needed to be explicit, but in there efforts to whitewash a young couples relationship while conveying intimacy they substituted Nagisa's incessant crying for a conventional/ socially acceptable/ standardized forms of affection. This kind of thing layered atop hackneyed and melodramatic plot   points like sports duels... it's too much, it's not funny or interesting.  In the end nothing about this slice of life story was believable and so it stopped being enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAbove is my review for Clannad After Story episodes 1-15. By the last episode I was so disappointed/underwhelmed that I quit watching. A number of people on this site said to finish, because the story takes a dramatic turn and the quality picks up etc. so I finished, but because 16 to 22 are so different that the first 15 I felt it was more appropriate to address them separately. I'm not going to address 23-25 because they're extras. \\n\\n\r\nWriting about 16-22 without spoilers is difficult; as I see it this second piece must be broken into three different stories (episode 16, 17-21, 23) trying to critique the writing without addressing the plot twists present in each component presented a unique challenge but I've tried not to give anything vital away.\\n\\n\r\nThe first part from a viewers perspective seemed obvious or inevitable. From the main character's perspective getting themselves into that situation so soon after Nagisa's previous ordeal, or falling into as it may have been (the writers didn't see fit to specify, not that I'd expect them to) was not impossibly reckless... just stupid beyond words.  \\n\\n\r\nIn part 2 there is a time lapse of five years. Now, try as I might and I invite anyone whose seen it to as well imagine a scenario where after five years things would emerge as they did. There was no way, things would have either been infinitely worse, or have gotten better sooner. The reason five was the magic number was they need time for that character (you know the one) to develop, but sacrificing logic towards a paradigm shift within a series is just bad writing.\\n\\n\r\nFinally part three: part three left me feeling off balanced. Compare the weight of the previous piece to the ending and you finish this series as if the ending didn't happen at all.\\n\\n\r\nMy final summation of the series: 1- 15, it was terrible. As for 16-22... I have a friend who once said that \"anything set to the Benny Hill theme song is funny\" (it is). In the same way the two big events that take place in the second half of the series are deeply moving, but they would have had that effect on anyone with any feelings at all regardless of context i.e. if they knew the characters, or the story were any good. Therefore, I say that those who defends this series based on the strength of 16-22 must have confused/ placed a cheap gimmick repeated twice in the span of six episodes (five really) over quality writing. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Love, Family and Sorrow.\r\nClannad [After Story], shows that everything comes to an end; I know that all things will come to an end, normally they would. But Clannad [After Story], shows it upon a persons certain point of view. Or what he thought of these \u201cend\u201d and \u201cendings\u201d.\r\nClannad [After Story] was the one who changed my whole viewing about Drama and Slice of Life genre anime. Clannad changed me for a while there while I was watching it. I didn\u2032t even held a tear while the most saddest parts were playing right before my very eyes. After Story had a huge changes from the firstseason, but the story is still revolving around Okazaki Tomoya, who always thought that nothing would and could never change, until a certain girl entered through his path - Furukawa Nagisa, whom Tomoya confessed his loved to in the final episode of the first season. It\u2032s not like some other anime, which when the guy confesses and the girl accepted, it\u2032ll just end there -- no. After Story continues from where it left off; continuing the path where Okazaki Tomoya is walking at.\\n\\n\r\nThey then had a relationship, where the both of them vowed that they will, no matter what, share every sorrow and happiness each one have. That both of them would help each other. After Story can actually be seated beside a real life; After Story is not some mediocre story, After Story shows us how life can be full of happiness, how having a family feels, how sad and full of grief life can be. After Story can teach you a one or two, life is not that easy, and that doing nothing would do you any good.\\n\\n\r\nPeople who haven\u2032t watched After Story might think that, this last season would be exactly the same as the first season. No, they aren\u2032t the same. Yes, I agree that the characters are still the same, but as soon as the story of After Story in the beginning part whereas it only centered around Okazaki Tomoya, his friends, who were special to him, also changed and had their own path which they walk through while Tomoya\u2032s path is still growing.\\n\\n\r\n- The plot of After Story, is hugely different from the prequel, whereas the story runs along with Tomoya\u2032s companions and acquaintances. After Story had it\u2032s plot viewing only around Okazaki Tomoya, from him, being just a highschool student at first, and now he is a man who works for his family, who shreds blood and sweat.\\n\r\nEvery now and then, After Story\u2032s plot is still one of the best that one can ever line up with. Changing ones point of view in life, how many changes can happen, how many tears might fall down on your cheeks without you, noticing it.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Story had a huge impact at me, the prequel, who had some comedy and funny scenes, changed to full drama in After Story. Where I wasn\u2032t able to hold back my tears on the sad parts; though After Story had a little bonding moment, to change the atmosphere a bit, but then again, changed to a tear-jerking one.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, After Story\u2032s part give\u2032s you a light and normal feeling; how former friends can reunite, have fun, and think of the good old times. Think of it as like a trailer, because when you\u2032ve watched the full storyline, prepare your tissues and try to hold back your tears. After Story emphasizes many standards of life. Also showing us some things that aren\u2032t meant to be.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Story teaches us a lot of things of what you might stumble upon at when you grow up. It teaches us how having a family can be fun, how having someone to help you, or you can rely on can be like. It\u2032s not all about smiles and happiness. Every now and then, you need to have some waterfall dashing out from your eyes. Grief and sorrow, are the things that Tomoya changed his life, again, after the one dearest to him, was taken. Tomoya didn\u2032t know what to do, or how is life is going to be after all what happened.\\n\\n\r\nPeople who had lost their dearest to them, must not let sadness take you with them, even if someone was taken from you, stand up and be strong. No matter how hurtful the things were that was given and bestowed upon you, always think of the good things that might come once again. After Story, on the other hand, had an alternate and one you can call, a true ending. (It\u2032ll be much of a spoiler to post it here.) But that might only happen, if the person really can\u2032t take living by himself, or God might even wake you up from your nightmare. Tomoya had a dream, where she first met Nagisa, but, it was an alternate one, daresay. She kept calling out Nagisa\u2032s name. And that\u2032s when she knew, how important she was to him.\\n\\n\r\nMany people has their own point of view in After Story, smile, happiness, sadness, grief, and love. That\u2032s what all the things you\u2032ll be stumbling upon while reminiscing through After Story.\\n\\n\r\nWho knows? It might be just a dream, and you might soon wake up from it.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Story shows deep emotions and strong points all through out the series. Don\u2032t think that nothing would change, everything and everyone undergoes changes. And experiences something they didn\u2032t  imagine to happen to them.\\n\\n\r\n~ Will add more later;",

            "content": "Honestly, I don't know where to start. At the part where I refused to watch this because \"Who wants to watch something like that?\" or the part where I found myself watching 20 episodes in one sitting with a runny nose and slightly red eyes?\r\nFor a while, I threw both Clannad seasons off because I didn't think it could interest me (and the first season almost confirmed that) but I stayed along because the amount of recommendations I received and I was not disappointed.\r\nPersonally, I believe that the stand out points for this anime are the sounds and characters. My God, the OST's! Just listeningto them after watching the series will have you mentally reliving the scenes and all the emotions along with it, they're so damn perfect! And characters, I constantly found small connections with the MC here and there, and that added so much more to my viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe story has moderate progression all the way up until the last 8 episodes or so, but it has some strange attraction that makes you want more and more. Following Okazaki through his life - from being a high school delinquent to finding his own feet as a man and a father, you really grow attached to it.\\n\\n\r\nThen comes the parts which Clannad is known for - the sorrow. This is what everyone points out when they recommend After Story, and rightly so. You are in for a ride on the feel train with this series, whether you cry, shed a slight tear, or keep a poker face.\\n\\n\r\nI gave this series a 9/10 rating because it was new to me, made me feel things I didn't expect, and was overall great. The reason for not gaining the extra marks to reach 10/10 was I feel they slightly overdid certain parts and paced some scenes poorly. It was like they milked certain situations too much, and that kind of ruined some moments for me.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you enjoy slice of life, romance, tear jerkers, and/or just an overall wonderful anime, I'd recommend this series 100% of the time.\\n\\n\r\nP.S- This is my first time writing a review and I am not too confident in it. Most of it is based off my own experience and views, so it may not be the most helpful one, but I hope I helped in any sort of way. Thank you!",

            "content": "Clannad, what do you know about Clannad? Clannad is known as a series that has an ability to make their watcher cry like a baby. At first sight, I thought it\u2019s just an overreact from community. I have a strong confidence with myself, the confidence that I won\u2019t drop a single of tears when it comes to watching an anime, a fiction story to be exact. I\u2019m starting to watch Clannad because I want to tell people to stop overreacting every single thing.\r\nClannad (first season) is a great drama series, but that\u2019s all. I\u2019ve lost some interest to continue it because I feel I\u2019m notwrong with my first hypotesis, people just love to overreact something. But at the end, I still continue to After Story, just in case.\\n\\n\r\nNow I got into After Story, the story starts really well and there\u2019s so many happy family moments here and there. Every episode can warm your heart, and calm your mind. Almost half of the series has passed and finally I can feel some heavy atmosphere, and it feels heavier when each episode has passed. Lastly, I got to see the infamous scenes that has the strongest affect to the story. Things got drastically changed after this.\\n\\n\r\nMy tears just flowing out naturally, my confidence are gone immediately. I ask to myself  \u201cWhat will I do if this is happened to me?\u201d even though it\u2019s only a little drop, the tears just came out. I keep thinking from the main character\u2019s perspective to got the fullest experience throughout the story, it\u2019s very hurt but it\u2019s worth it. I don\u2019t have any relate story with Clannad from my life, but if you\u2019ve something similar happened to your life, you will get a 10x better experience. Clannad will make you see your life from much bigger picture.\\n\\n\r\nI have to mention the music. The music is one of the biggest reason why Clannad can made people cry, because it\u2019s just perfectly fit with the scenes, and the timing is just brilliant, no other word can describe it better than perfect. The animation, scenes, and transition are also seems very smooth, Kyoto Animation just made their best work in Clannad, a big shoutout to all of the staff, and praise to the director, Tatsuya Ishihara.\\n\\n\r\nFrom that day, I saw Clannad as one of the most special anime I\u2019ve ever watched, a masterpiece in my book. It\u2019s not because of the story can make my tears came out, it\u2019s just everything about Clannad is very special.\\n\\n\r\nClannad isn\u2019t supposed to be handled, but you\u2019re supposed to feel it without being held back. Don\u2019t take it as a challange, just let your heart feel it directly, and you will have a phenomenal experience.",

            "content": "Before you read this review, there are two things you should know.\r\n1) It is only going to add fuel to the fire for those who don\u2019t like Clannad: After Story and infuriate those who do. Read at your own risk.\r\n2)This review isn\u2019t telling you to not watch Clannad or After Story. On the contrary; if you have ever considered it, go watch it. Form your own opinion. This is mine.\r\nStill here? Great.\r\nIll start off with what I did like about it, so that I don\u2019t come across as a jerk right off the bat. Oh and dont worry; Im not going to tell you Clannad:After Story is only good or bad because it plays with peoples emotions. I think emotions are great and if an anime or any form of art makes you really feel something, thats a triumph in itself.  I\u2019m also warning you though, I\u2019m not going to be talking about the art style/music/enjoyment stuff in detail. If you wanna know, all those aspects of the show are good (Ill go minutely in depth on the subject at the end). What I will be discussing are the overall cinematic and story telling aspects that stood out to me, for better or worse.\\n\\n\r\nYou'd think most anime producers never made it out of high school by the sheer plethora of Slice of Life's that deal with just plain high school semantics. Don\u2019t get me wrong; I\u2019m aware other SoLs exist and honestly high school is a great setting for characters, relationships, and relatablity to just about all of the anime community (over 13). What makes Clannad: After Story great is how it takes the step further. It goes beyond the confines of the above-ish average (Clannad review pending) high school SoL it starts as to the setting of adulthood, a league of its own, and I'll admit: Clannad: After Story knows what it does, and does it well. This is the main selling point of the series. Clannad: After Story creates a highly relatable tale by going, well, what most of us consider after the story, like that moment you wonder what the characters do once they save the world or share their first kiss, etc. And it does this without fluffing it up or getting too supernatural on us (NO BEACH SCENE included). I.e., it doesn\u2019t forget what it is, and what it is is pretty compelling itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing I liked was really a person: Tomoya Okazaki. I'm not trying to say I dig the pseudo bad boy gets good girl gig, but I mean to say I like Tomoya's development as a character. You can truly see, not by shape or body size, but by actions, Tomoya grow and change from a stereotypical \u2018delinquent\u2019 kid to a responsible adult. This makes sense. While his character isn\u2019t particularly compelling or amazing, that's what makes him great. He's relatable. He is us, and we can get his problems and triumphs.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, enough praise. Many now may be questioning what my problem with the series could be if I\u2019m praising both the premise and the main character, both the very basics of practically any show. But the greatest aspects of Clannad: After Story are overshadowed by equally glaring flaws surrounding them. Ill be employing a three strikes rule.\\n\\n\r\nStrike 1: Remember how I said Clannad: After Story knows what it is? Problem here is the fact that it takes about the first eight episodes for it to remember that. As in, the first eight episodes are just more Clannad, not really After Story material. As in plot doesnt necessarily progress until episode 10ish. The first eight episodes are just small side stories, the stuff Clannad was good at, and by themselves they are still cute and mildly touching, but in the grand scheme of Clannad: After Story, they didn\u2019t fit. To be specific, there\u2019s the equivalent of a character recap episode and then three two episode long arcs that concern Sunohara, the lady that kept up with the boys dorm, and that girl in the library who served tea separately (if you can\u2019t tell I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve seen Clannad. You should). I honestly couldn\u2019t remember the other two's names unless I looked them up because they were just static characters before then, and yet now there have been five episodes devoted to them.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, these sections aren\u2019t bad, and they at least follow the Clannad code of giving every character a bit of backstory and- Oh wait. What about Kyou? Tomoyo? Ryou? The very girls in the intro? You're going to tell me your static characters get more priority than the actual heroines of your source material?  Why? The first eight episodes do nothing to progress the Nagisa and Tomoya relationship the series is based around (except one section that explains some supernatural mumbo jumbo that wont be of importance until much later). \\n\\n\r\nAnd this wouldn\u2019t be a problem if it was just regular Clannad, but its supposed to be After Story. Then around episode 9 the series suddenly remembers its Clannad: After Story and not Clannad: More Useless Side Story, in which WHOO timeskip half a year or more! Boom- Graduation- all those characters they just spent 30 plus episodes developing GONE. The shift is so jarring youre almost left wondering if you\u2019re watching the same show.\\n\\n\r\nAnd all you\u2019ve got now is Nagisa, her family, and Tomoya. Clannad: After Story begins.\\n\\n\r\nNow Ill take a pause and say that some, maybe most, would say that this sudden transition from youth to adulthood is very realistic and is one of the greater strengths of After Story. I can\u2019t exactly agree. I mean, there is no build up to the graduation, no foreshadowing the transition. There's just a sudden timeskip. My question is, why didn\u2019t you just start after graduation? Imagine this:\\n\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve said, the first set of episodes feels like Clannad, and as I\u2019m going to say (Clannad review pending), Clannad feels drawn out in the first arc and rushed through at the end. If you want a break down, the Fuka arc of Clannad was 9 episodes long, the Katomi's like 6, and a sort of dual Tomoyo and Nagisa arc carrying out the final 7 canon episodes. I say dual because while Nagisa's drama club attempt is directly related to Tomoyo, the focus is definitely heavily focused towards one or the other. So 9, 6, 3, 4, and then a string of 2s (episodes per arc). doesn\u2019t  that seem like they just tried to cram as much as possible in the longer they went on?\\n\\n\r\nNow lets say instead the Fuka arc was made a little shorter, and all those extra episodes at the end were thrown away, and the first eight of After Story were then tacked with Clannad instead (minus the introductory one and the total useless one about the gangs), and you'd have a nice 26 episode series, and then a 13 episode After Story series that had all its shit together (dont be fooled by the length. After Story ends on episode 22 here too.) THAT would be a fabulous transition. Or just SCREW all that static character crap and focus on what the VN was about; the heroines. Its like if the entire first act of Romeo and Juliet was about all extras for the party, and then Romeo and Juliet just ditching the place in the very next scene, never to return. All in all, the execution was poor planning and poor production.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of my problems can be summed up with one word.\\n\\n\r\nStrike Two: Nagisa.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously. Screw her. I laugh at the thought that I was ever supposed to cry over her. Okay, okay, hold on, dont leave. In Clannad terms, she's really not that bad. I mean the first season. As a high school girl, it makes sense for her to be innocent, naive, immature, and generally all things moe. Problems arise when, following graduation, she doesn\u2019t  change. She fails to grow out of her moe bullshit. While Tomoya gains some sense of responsibility, Nagisa manages to still sound like a small child that might get lost if you leave her alone too long. She doesn\u2019t  grow up. She doesn\u2019t develop. She remains totally unrelatable. So whenever something happens in which I\u2019m obviously supposed to blinded by tears, I\u2019m honestly feeling boredom. While the first few episodes at least managed to make me care just a bit about characters who barely had more than five lines the first time around, the mid arc doesn\u2019t  even bring a twinge out of someone I\u2019m supposed to care deeply about by now (I guess...). Instead, I found myself more often than not listlessly waiting for characters to just quit monologuing. Seriously, I can\u2019t stress how useless Nagisa is. Its like her entire character is meant to never grow up, show cased by her repeating school multiple times. Maybe its just her stupid moe voice, but everything she said following getting together with Tomoya sounds equivalent to a grade schooler, not a supposedly grown woman. Case in point: \"Tomoya and I have sex and sex makes babies!\" And while this sounds cute, remember, this is supposed to be the SoL all about 'adulthood' and 'the real world'. I wouldn\u2019t trust this girl with a potted plant, much less a baby. Her moe quits working its charm when she\u2019s not sheltered in the high school atmosphere anymore. That\u2019s a realistic statement, my friend.\\n\\n\r\nWhy couldn\u2019t they have followed some normal girl, like... okay, none of the other characters are really relatable. The girls are either dependent on moe or ultra-violent, and every man besides Tomoya is a ditz. Every single one stays in the cardboard cutout of a personality except maybe Kyou who tones down the crazy near the end, but its not like they take the time to develop her or anything. She\u2019s just in every intro. (no getting over that) They\u2019re all so glued to their stereotypes, And take pride in it! One episode there is a mock graduation ceremony for Nagisa in which everyone returns and looks exactly the same as from the beginning of the Clannad.  And then one final get together in which Sunohara has the audacity to say \u201cI\u2019m just so glad to see that nobody has changed.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nTo which I proceeded to beat my head against a wall than watch more of this show.\\n\\n\r\nLets get something straight. People are meant to change, especially when you grow up. If you\u2019re acting the same as a thirty year old as you were a thirteen year old, you\u2019re doing something wrong. And while I\u2019m not expecting a total transformation on Nagisa\u2019s part, I would at least like so see something of the equivalent of Tomoya or at least WOULD YOU PLEASE STOP HUGGING YOUR STUPID DANGO DOLLS. Look, if you like stuffed animals at twenty, great, but symbolically in this show, its just another check on the not growing up side of things. I mean, Tomoya grows up, so why not anybody else? \\n\\n\r\nWhatever.\\n\\n\r\nStrike Three: The Happy Ending.\\n\\n\r\nLook. I have nothing against happy endings (Im thinking Steins; Gate). I simply have a problem with endings/resolutions that dues ex machia their way out of a bad/sad ending(Im thinking the first arc of Sword Art Online. Ya know, the Sword Art Online one?). And I loathe endings that attempt to explain their dues ex machia ending. Shows like Steins; Gate get around this loathing because it was built up from the very beginning and succeeds in explanation. You could argue further that Clannad planned it very the very beginning as well, but there was little success in said explanation. It was kinda like \u2018Oh but don\u2019t worry everything works out just because yay!\u2019. Yes, his repairing his relationship with his dad was well played on their part, and had been a theme since the beginning. But was it really necessary to tack the supernatural wish stuff with it? What was that whole business with the other world? Did it really matter? Was the happy ending really necessary? Maybe I\u2019m fighting with the source material here again, but damnit producers, make a choice! Clannad, the show that was 95% realism pulls a supernatural ending out of its hat that just destroys what the show was heading to be about, which was perseverance. Or maybe its saying that if you try hard enough everything will work out, but again, not everything is just going to fix itself.\\n\\n\r\nSo the ending single handedly cuts down any sense of reality you got from the show. I would have been content, even happy, with it just ending like episode 19 or 20, and it would have felt resolved. Then Id have to find something else to bitch about, or maybe then I would\u2019ve liked it enough to not fuss this much. But no, they had to push the feels to the farthest level so that Clannad goes down as being the most emotionally damaging show ever and then making a full 180 to singlehandedly win back all those people who would have otherwise cursed the shows very existence, because God forbid anything but a perfectly happy ending. Admittedly some not so happy endings suck (Im thinking of Gurren Lagann), but that\u2019s just because they forget the theme of the show in the last minute, or maybe screw it up just to insure the bittersweet ending because I honestly don\u2019t know. Endings are just straight up hard I guess. \\n\\n\r\nAnd what was with the last ten minutes of just filler in episode 22? Okay, sorry, I\u2019m done.\\n\\n\r\nEndnotes:\\n\r\nArt: Consistently beautiful and a plethora of well-made characters, I can\u2019t bash on the art. It was easy on the eyes. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: While not a ton of tracks stood out in particular, there were a couple like what I\u2019d call the \u2018Feels Track\u2019 that they play whenever shit gets real that are memorable. The dub, on the other hand, feels really spot on. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nStory: If I were to give a score on a per episode basis of when I cared, it\u2019d be about a 10/25. Sooo\u2026 4/10? Look, After Story part is a 8/10, and if the other stuff was Clannad, itd be a 8/10 too actually, but side by side, it\u2019s a bad juxtaposition.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 2/10. Tomoya is that two. Well him and Ushio. They carry the day. (But I do have moderate affection for Akio).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 5/10. I didn\u2019t fall in love with it or anything, and I did put it down for a while. That entire mid arc had be pulling nails out, but the end arc was enjoyable enough to redeem it, and the beginning, good. It\u2019s a good show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nBy MAL standards, Id rate this as Bad (or Decent/Poor). Not because its actually bad to the point of unwatchable, and it feels like it should be above average, but honestly the parts as a whole feel like a broken system, like that sad little robot in the world that\u2019s coming to an end. It works and can move on its own and has heart, but I can only think of small sections of which I actually enjoyed watching and understood its relevance. \\n\\n\r\nWith that, Id love someone to come and fight me now. Preferably bleached hair. I gotta work on my Tomoya cosplay.\\n",

            "content": "The continuation of Clannad just gets better. Everyone has now graduated, well all except Nagisa-chan because of her illness. The story now extends up to the next 10 years. And what can I say about this, I\u2019ve never been touched so deeply by an Anime. It\u2019s simply too touching. The whole situation is sad, and yet there\u2019s something good about all of it. After watching it completely, I\u2019d have no doubt saying that Clannad After Story is truly the best romantic anime series I\u2019ve ever seen.\r\nStoryline:\r\nThe story continues from where it left off. At the beginning there are a few more individual story arcs, ofYouhei (The Protagonists Male friend), Misae (The Dorm Keeper) and Yukine (The girl from the reference library). All these arcs just keep up the brilliance that began from the start of the season. After then on, it\u2019s pretty much about Tomoya and Nagisa. Throughout the Anime you\u2019d feel for both of them, and Nagisa\u2019s parents. I personally was touched and saddened by many events that occurred later on, while also being happy seeing them live out their lives. It has been executed very well, you\u2019d feel for them. The whole story is simply heart-warming. I absolutely loved it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacterization: \\n\r\nAll the list of characters THROUGHOUT the Clannad series are great in their own way. Clannad After Story continue with the story of Nagisa and Tomoyo and have added many elements to their character. It\u2019s not all fairy tales here. It\u2019s real, and it\u2019s perfect. Both of their characters go through a lot in the Anime, and nowhere will you see any nonsensical drama or fakeness. In fact, their characters are what make you cry. A special mention also to Nagisa-chan\u2019s parents, their roles play an important part in this series. Overall, great characterization, even though characters appear nothing different from ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nAnimation is fairly well. The production house is the same as the ones who had made Canon and Air, and they have improved a lot. Air didn\u2019t appear that good (as I mentioned in my review of it), but Clannad After Story was a good improvement. Characters appear nice, some are cute. Overall, it\u2019s quite good. ^_^ Couldn\u2019t find anything that I particularly disliked.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\r\nThe opening of Clannad was great, and the opening of After Story is simply amazing. ^__^ I really loved it. Throughout the Anime, the background score has been pretty good to hear. Comparing it to the previous season, I found it better. :)\\n\\n\r\nConcluding,\\n\r\nAnything above an 8.5 for me is great. Anything above 9 means epic. Just goes to show how good I feel the Anime to be. It\u2019s definitely not worth missing out on. Yes it is kinda emotional, but its nothing like immature love crap you see in many Animes. Its way more serious, and it\u2019s definitely better. Clannad After Story rocks \\m/\\n",

            "content": "Get the Kleenex ready! You're gonna need it. \r\nAfter Story is by no means like the first season. It becomes a story of tragedy, regret, ill-fated love; something that will turn the casual, \"feel-good,\" anime watcher completely off to After Story. I consider myself one of those people. I like the Itazura na Kiss type of ending and progression; I like a story that rarely has any heart-wrenching moments. Sure, there can be troubles along the way, but I don't want it to detract from the overall, feel-good feeling that comes from watching those types of animes. \r\nBut then, you get After Story. I hada hard time clicking play on a few episodes in the later portions of the anime. This anime was hard to watch. You're going to want to stop, you're going to question yourself as to why you continue to click play even though your mind and emotions are screaming: \"No more!\" \\n\r\nYou click because you want a resolution. You want a solution to this world, this town, that's seemingly unsolvable. You want Tomoya and Nagisa to be happy, healthy, and thriving. And there are times when it is impossible to see the light at the end of the tunnel, if not for the tiniest pinprick, dimly shining thousands of feet away. You want to challenge the show: \"Bring on the destruction of lives, the torment, and the death; I can take it.\" You won't be able to. \\n\r\nYou won't be able to for one simple fact: you love these characters. Allowed into their lives and have been transported to their world. You're there for every tear, memory, and moment. If, by this point, you aren't attached to the characters, herein lies the justification for numbness and naivety you might procure towards characters' instances down the road. But, I beg of you: please understand them. If you do, this show will be among the deepest you will ever watch. \\n\\n\r\nThis is almost perfect. However, I cannot overlook the fact that show changed identities too drastically. The sorrowful moments are brought upon you so quickly and so painfully, it's heart-wrenching to witness. I, myself, at some points didn't find this to be entertainment, but excruciating. \\n\\n\r\nThis show has earned the right to stand alone in the upper-echelon of romance animes. Still, though, it comes down to personal preference - \"beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder\" one very wise person once said, and to me, After Story was extremely beautiful in every provided category. But, everyone who watches this anime will come together to watch something each with different perspectives of the world. Some might come having lost a family member, others may come to it after marriage. Some may come to it from a world of \"crying displays weakness\" and they choose not to cry because it's who they are. Some might come to this and have been told it's okay, it's right to weep whenever you feel like weeping, and so they weep. \\n\\n\r\nThis show was the first piece of entertainment that has ever made me cry. I did not expect that the first thing would be anime. I don't feel like I'm a lesser person because of it, oh no. I feel that I chose to cry because I thought it was something that had a profound effect on my mind and heart. If you choose to laugh, sob, or remain devoid of emotion, After Story will get at you somehow, whether you like it or not.\\n\r\n9/10.",

            "content": "I'll be honest, I didn't like Clannad at all, and I had very low expectations for AS. Despite that, After Story STILL managed to disappoint me.\r\nStory - 4/10\r\nAfter Story picks up where Clannad S1 left off, that is to say, it continues helpless-girl-of-the-week for the entire first half, before moving on to the real meat of the season where Tomoya and his friends graduate and enter the real world. This kind of plot development isn't typical of moe shows, so AS gets a point for that. Most slice-of-life/high school-based shows end when the characters leave high school, as though life ends when high school does.However, the ending of AS absolutely destroys any credibility that it created with the depiction of Tomoya's struggles by hastily throwing together an ending that clearly pandered to its audience. I won't say what it is to avoid spoilers, but rest assured, it is an ending that A) Was an obvious ass-pull, and B) Was never explained properly. On top of that, the last two episodes aren't even the real ending because they consisted of a recap episode and an AU (alternative universe) episode that didn't fit at all with the tone of the second half nor AS's overall plot. It's completely bewildering to me as to why the writers chose to end AS this way. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI didn't particularly like Clannad's art style, but once I got used to it, I stopped minding it. Clean lines, bright colours...that's the extent of what I can say about the art. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing in the soundtrack was very memorable, except the opening and the variations of it in the BGM. Overall, nothing to write home about. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe harem aspect from S1 was not present in AS, which personally made AS's characters more palatable for me. Tomoya himself got a decent amount of character development that was arguably 'written over' with the asspulled ending. The female lead herself was as sweet as ever, which I found myself disliking less simply because I'd gotten used to it. Still, this doesn't excuse the fact that Clannad+AS has some of the blandest characters I've ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed AS for a few episodes, for example, Yukine's arc and a certain episode set in a field of sunflowers. Apart from that, I spent most of AS being bored. Though AS had a few sad moments, I found most of its 'sad' moments incredibly melodramatic and therefore ineffective as a result. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI heard over and over that After Story was better than S1, that everything builds up in a huge emotional payoff. Well, I feel like I spent the entirety of AS waiting for an emotional payoff that never arrived. Part of it was the characters, part of it was the ham-handed writing. Like a clumsy puppeteer jerking on strings, AS constantly tried to smack me over the face with how TRAGIC everything was. But without subtlety and realism, the drama felt like sappy melodrama, reducing what could've been an interesting exploration of adulthood into...well, sappy melodrama. Still, I'll concede that AS was better than S1. But given how much I disliked S1, AS being better is not a hard feat to accomplish. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone except fans of Key.",

            "content": "There comes a time, when, something hits you in a way that makes you feel, lost.  You're overcome with what you had just saw and you can't help but feel, lost.  This review is about Clannad: Afterstory, an anime that is very dear to my heart, and one, that I feel is Kyoto Animation's best works.  \r\nStory (10/10): The story of Clannad: Afterstory is very different from its prequel, Clannad.  While Clannad revolves around the life of Tomoya in his 3rd year in high school, helping out various girls with various sorts of problems, this anime focuses solely on the relationshipbetween Tomoya and Nagisa with their life transitioning from teenage life into adulthood.  The reason why this anime could be praised highly on its story is due to its far reaching, beyond the anime realm of high school where it originates from.  It focuses on the main character Tomoya in a way that creates incredible development in his character, while keeping its mystical supernatural theme in play.  Note, you cannot under any circumstances understand what is happening in this anime without watching the original Clannad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10): The characters of afterstory has dwindled greatly from Clannad itself, throwing out almost all of the other characters that were there previously.  Tomoya, as the main protagonist, is his usual cynical, but funny self with his attitude towards life.  As the story progresses, Tomoya becomes more self-aware of his actions and takes responsibility for them.  Any more explanation is considered as a spoiler.  Next is Nagisa.  As the main female protagonist, Nagisa returns as her usual cheerful self in trying to make the people around her happy, especially her boyfriend, Tomoya.  As the series goes on, Nagisa thinks more about her future with Tomoya, ultimately influencing Tomoya as well, changing him even further.  Next are Nagisa's parents Akio and Sanae.  As a comical duo, the general gags that run with them return as well.  These 2 have incredible importance due to their parental guidance to Tomoya, influencing him as well.  Apart from them, there is one little character that deserves mentioning, but revealing it would be a very big spoiler.  \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (9/10): With the art, the art stays with its original Clannad look with highly moe-infected characters with eyes that to me resemble galaxies, and well done scenery and shades.  For the sound, a new set of music that sounds great for Clannad's storyline and is something to behold.  With its OP sounding at a high level rivaling its prequel's OP, it definitely is something to praise upon.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (10/10): When I look at Clannad, I see my own personal morals.  The importance of family, the trials and tribulations of various life situations, and the hilarious moments that life can provide.  When I watched this, I just felt at home watching because of how close it touched me, especially in the second half.  (For some reason, I'm shedding tears just writing this.) Just watching the characters interact and watching Tomoya especially, it just made me feel like I was part of that world.  Kyoto ani are dicks for making this one of the biggest tearjerkers I have ever watched.  (Seriously, I brought a tissue box with me, it was empty after the marathoning.) Because this anime touched my heart in a way that no other anime was able to, this is by far one of my top 3.  Unless you have a heart of pure stone or don't give a damn about your family, you will cry when watching this.  It made me appreciate my family more then I have ever done before.  I highly recommend this to anyone.  Even if you're a fan of random action and high intensity thrillers where everyone dies, I HIGHLY recommend this.  It's that good.  And one more thing, Dango.  :)",

If you are not interested in my own little story, you can pass on reading this.*\r\nI have never written a review on any movie or anime I have watched. Not because I don't find any of them good. I've seen a lot of good movies and animes obviously, but none seems to reach the level that motivates me enough to click on the \"Write a review\" button. This is the first, and maybe even the last, because clearly Clannad ~After Story~ is going to be the best anime I've ever watched for my wholelife.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe first half is impressive, of course, but not enough to be highly praised by the rank #4 on MAL. If you have any intention of dropping the anime after the first 12 episides, DON'T DO IT, for god's sake, and your own. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I start on the latter half, I want you to know that I've never cried watching any movie or anime and I didn't believe that anything can change that.\\n\\n\r\nCrying is for pussies, or so I've thought up until that point. \\n\\n\r\nBut the latter half.\\n\\n\r\n It changed me.\\n\\n\r\n I was the kind who just don't care about other people, to  think that I can do whatever I like. At that time, I was studying abroad so it cost my family a whole lot to finance my study. But given my personality, I didn't focus on my study and that let my parents down greatly. Hell, I'll just have fun with my friends anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAfter finishing Clannad ~After Story~, I've realized how childish, foolish I was. I realized there are still other people living in this world, that I must care about. There are still my mother, my father, who have sacrificed so much for me (like in the anime). It was then I realized that how much love I've received from them, and I immediately burst into tears at the end. Afterward, I just sit on my chair, rethinking how wrong I was living my own life.\\n\\n\r\nIt was awakening.\\n\\n\r\nI apprehended the meaning of responsibility. Not only for myself, but for the ones I hold dear as well. It was the responsibility that I decided to embrace, not run away from, that changed me. And it was Clannad ~After Story~ that implicitly transferred it to me. \\n\\n\r\nI started to get better at school, by putting in more effort in it. Eventually I was admitted into a university, so it did work out well.\\n\\n\r\nYou saved a soul, Key. And Kyoto Animation. If any of you ever come across this, I thank you for ever creating such a masterpiece. I'm positive I'm not the only soul you've saved.\\n\\n\r\nFinal words: If I've never watched Clannad and Clannad ~After Story~, I probably won't be the me now. And probably some random loser, or in Tarot card you'd call me The Fool. If you're hesitating on watching this anime, don't be. I assure you it'll be a eye-opener for most, if not all. Even for those who aren't even interested in anime, like who I was before watching this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor any who still don't know, Clannad is a Gaelic word for Family. Yes, this anime will make you rethink what family is to you.\\n\\n",

            "content": "disclaimer: this is not a review to recommend (or discommend) the anime to new viewers, this is a review to anchor my feelings to memory so i can recall later what i did and didn't like about this anime.  as such, this will sound very harsh to people who love this anime; you might want to just skip it if you are one of those.  remember that these are my feelings, valid only for myself; nothing here is meant to sway you from your own, or to belittle what you feel.  if this anime makes you cry, you're not inferior to peoplewho don't shed a tear, but they're not unfeeling compared to you either.  fictional works are often intensely personal, dependent on what we each bring to them, and what touches us in what way.\\n\\n\r\nthis review will contain massive SPOILERS.\\n\\n\r\ni watched clannad first and didn't care for it; i felt it was mostly manipulative fakery accompanied by some juvenile comedy.  under normal circumstances i wouldn't watch the sequel, but since it is even more highly rated and i am on a quest to watch the 500 top-rated anime of all times, i watched it anyway.\\n\\n\r\nunfortunately, this was also a miss for me, if for different reasons.   first of all, the sound was worse; the BGM very repetitive, and the ED a jarring contrast to many episodes.  if sound is bad, it constantly rubs my nerves the wrong way.  on the positive side, some of what i especially disliked about clannad is better here:  for part of the anime the story feels more genuine.  but then the creators decided to either be the biggest trolls ever, or they turned from master manipulators into tone-deaf idiots.  WHAT THE HELL IS WITH THAT ENDING!?\\n\\n\r\nthroughout the show, i kept being particularly interested in the mysterious story about the girl and the mechanical doll put together from junk.  the mood was very evocative, and the art beautiful.  i kept feeling there was something serious and meaningful here.  there was.  but the creators managed to ruin it in one fell swoop.  in any case, this was a brilliant idea that clearly turned out much too ambitious for the writer, who could neither interlace it better so we would get progressively more clues, nor resolve it without leaving one giant turd with fly sparkles in place of its sad beauty.\\n\\n\r\nalright, from the top.  the first few arcs were mostly the same as the prequel; we get some back story on some people who're then cast off -- visual game adaptation is hard, sez barbie.  the art and animation seemed slightly better to me, though i still find the females' character designs creepy.  and once again i dispute that this is a \"slice of life\" anime; real gangs don't act like this by any stretch of the imagination; nevermind the supernatural elements, and the bottomless idiocy of sunohara.  his supposed comic relief made me cringe.\\n\\n\r\nthen the part started that i liked a lot better, and which could qualify as \"slice of life\" and \"coming of age\", and where we see a lot of character development: tomoya graduates and starts working.  this is very detailed and well done.  nagisa also grows, and stops being a total crybaby.  oh, how i wish the entire anime had this sort of feel to it.  i also like that the harem disappears entirely, and the story features only tomoya and nagisa's romance.  the downside to that is that the characters one might have invested some interest in are totally sidelined to only appear once or twice; they might have as well not existed.  i guess despite allegedly valuing those school friendships, \"family\" in clannad does not include close friends.  too bad.\\n\\n\r\nthe romance is extremely puritanical (these two blush when just holding hands even after getting married; which century are we in exactly?), but i believe love comes in many different guises, and sex can very easily be only a small part of romantic love (or indeed be absent entirely). not all love is grand and fierily passionate, some is quiet and soothing.  these two have quiet and soothing down pat.  i like their relationship, it's mutually supportive, and completely lacking of stupid misunderstandings so often used to create drama -- well, this show does not need any extra drama, so thanks for that.  even though nagisa takes on a more traditional role as housewife, she is never seen as inferior.  these two are equals; tomoya helps out with chores without having to be nagged, and when nagisa wants to work outside the home, he is only worried about her health, and there is nothing macho in his concern.\\n\\n\r\nalas the story frays here.  in fact, nagisa working as a waitress breaks the suspension of disbelief for me, because this girl has been so sick that she's had to repeat her senior year of high school twice now, and she's supposed to be working as a waitress?  slice of life, my hairy white a** -- waitressing is hard work; on your feet all day running around carrying heavy trays.  no, this bit is added solely to add fanservice because nagisa gets dressed in a maid outfit and her daddy drools over her.  i cannot stand this pseudo-incestual crap in anime.  it cheapens the character of akio, and it makes light of nagisa's illness.\\n\\n\r\nfrom here on out i have trouble sorting feelings based in cultural beliefs from my feelings about the story as written.  nagisa wants a baby.  people do worry about her health, but, what i'd want to have happen is for somebody to seriously talk with her about alternatives such as adoption.  nobody ever asks whether she has thought about what it would mean for tomoya (and for the baby) if she died in childbirth.  we see nothing from her that indicates any concerns for that.  as written, it feels seriously irresponsible to me, and nagisa's character loses any possible development.  but for all i know adoption might be unpopular/taboo in japan because society values ancestral lineage.  anyway, the writing is on the wall, and covered in red spider lilies.\\n\\n\r\nso, nagisa dies.  ushio, the baby lives.  tomoya becomes his father, or rather, he becomes worse than his father:  he abandons his child and sinks into grief.\\n\\n\r\nfor 5 years.  dear creators, you have just killed all my affection for tomoya, and why?  because you wanted to jerk my emotion around some more later.  unforgivable.\\n\\n\r\ni understand grief.  i have lost my partner.  i know that bottomless abyss will seek to suck you in and never let you go.  but i didn't abandon my dog, nevermind an infant.  being an adult means you cannot abnegate all responsibility when you're hurt. since this is a story about family, let me say loud and clear that leaving tomoya to rot for 5 years is not what family and friends do.  what the creators have done here is ruin my affection not just for tomoya, but for everyone involved.  akio and sanae raise ushio (ok, praiseworthy), entirely without tomoya's input, and 5 years later, when ushio is appropriately cute and can talk, they throw them together one day out of the blue, without backup, without warning.  manipulative drama; this is NOT how a good family acts.\\n\\n\r\nbut wait, there's more.  on the arranged trip tomoya takes with his ueber-cute daughter, he runs into his paternal grandmother for apparently the first time ever, who tells him the touching story of how his father came to be such an apparent loser and crappy father.  some family -- where the hell was his grandmother all these years when tomoya felt he had nobody, and developed only disdain for his father?  telling him the story could have done some good when he was a teenager.  that's what decent family would have done.  but no, here every bit of suffering has to be milked for maximum tear jerking gain.\\n\\n\r\ni scoffed at how this was done, but i was relieved, because i thought, ok, tomoya will go back home and reunite with his dad, now that he understands from first hand experience what he must have gone through, and they can all live together with ueber-cute ushio; lessons learned harshly, but hey, learned at last.  family actually means something, and you should talk things out instead of walking away. \\n\\n\r\nbut no.  we clearly haven't been milked of all possible tears yet.  ushio must die too.  why tomoya blames the city instead of the writer, i can't know.  me, i blame the writer.\\n\\n\r\nand then guess what?  in some terminally tortured way the story of the lonely girl with the mechanical doll is resolved to magically pushes a giant reset button and tomoya gets to live happily ever after with nagisa and ushio.\\n\\n\r\nack, ptui, spit.  i would rate this a 1 if that would punish the creators.  the ending totally undermines tomoya's development, and the story of everyone who has conquered grief to continue living a worthwhile life.  it is a cheap deus ex machina plot to give a sugary sweet ending to go with the sugary moe character design.   you can do this in a game as one possible ending, but not in an anime adaptation of something i am supposed to take seriously.\\n\\n\r\nthis could have been a legitimate drama if it had ended after tomoya reunites with ushio and his father.  heck, add him falling in love with kyou who is now ushio's kindergarten teacher, if you must have a romantic happy ending.  but not this.  this confirms what i thought when watching the prequel, that it was all manipulative fakery, carefully crafted for maximum tear extraction at the expense of authentic emotion.  if i owned the DVD set i'd be throwing it against the wall.\\n\\n\r\nclannad is as fake about family as its name -- which is NOT irish for family.  \"clann\" is irish for family.  clannad is the name of an irish band and stands for \"clann as dobhar\" (family from dore), which means the writer of this opus didn't even do any damn research on something as important as the name of the story.  that's all par for the course; where the metal meets the road the families in clannad don't talk when they should, don't act when they should, and are not at all what family can be when it tries its best.",

            "content": "I'll be crucified for saying this, but I'll say it anyway. \r\nThere's no need to watch the first season to comprehend or like the second season. If you're not up to excessive moeness and a dull story, the prequel might end up making you don't watch the sequel, which would definitely be a waste.\r\nYou can get a pretty good idea of what the first season was by watching the first 8 episodes of Clannad ~after story~. All the mistakes from the previous series are there. Lame humor, dull drama, unlikely reactions to over-dramatized conflicts and a weak soundtrack.\r\nI was very close to dropping thisanime thanks to KyoAni stupidity in copying every single aspect from the prequel. There were some improvements, it's true. After episode 8, the soundtrack was much better and even the art seemed more beautiful. Also, I have to admit that, thanks to being 4 episodes long (contrasted to 7, 8 episodes long arcs in Clannad), it wasn't that hard to watch Sunohara's and Misae's arcs.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, some light shone upon Kyoto Animation and they realized that a more tangible plot without relying in nonsense supernatural references or in bad jokes every two minutes would work way better to actually create a dramatic environment.\\n\\n\r\nFrom episodes 9 to episode 21 we are delivered a beautiful and extremely saddening story of the hardships of becoming an adult, having dreams, seeing they fall apart and getting over dark times.\\n\\n\r\nHardly did an anime approach these topics in such an effective way without losing focus that they are dealing with human beings and not perfect beings who are flawless or solve everything with some tears and \"I'm sorry\" all the time (which basically summarizes the first installment).\\n\\n\r\nTomoya's adult life's story unfolds in a carefully detailed account of how life can be a bitch. It's really easy to connect with him, suffer with him and cry with him many times, too. It was a wonderful development to his personality making him an extremely likable character, probably one of my favorite male characters ever.\\n\\n\r\nNagisa had some development, too. But overall, I still felt a bit annoyed by her quite often childish personality. Even when she acted a bit more independent and adult-like it was hard to not think of her as a child.\\n\\n\r\nUshio goes without saying. Probably the main reason many tears were shed in this series. Her voice actress did a wonderful job in giving life to such a special child.\\n\\n\r\nBut in the end KyoAni couldn't resist revisiting old mistakes. In the very ending it was decided, in a way that seemed completely out of the blue, that after causing so many tears, telling such a beautiful, tangible and human-like story they would laugh hard at your face and say \"Just kidding, it was all a lie\".\\n\\n\r\nIt was completely uncalled for. It fell like a rock, crushing everything that had been done up to that point. I understand the need of a happy ending. But one thing is ending happily, another thing is destroying 13 episodes of development just for the sake of an unreal conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nI was more disappointed from this outrageous flaw than I was from watching the first series. The feeling I got was \"Oh, we didn't have the guts to make the story follow the pace it was following so far, so we decided to change everything in the last episode just not to make you sad anymore. Here, have some candies\"\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, a poor ending causes tremendous damage in a very promising show. It always angers me the desperate need of a complete surreal \"happy\" ending that so many movies, animes, series, etc have rather than showing a more soothing and human-like ending.\\n\\n\r\nStill, it's a highly enjoyable show. Just don't expect much of the conclusion.",

            "content": "Clannad ~After Story~ is the fourth anime produced by the Key/KyoAni tag team that by now everyone is very familiar with. It is also the first direct sequel of a Key/KyoAni anime, continuing the story after the events of Clannad.\r\nStory: The story of Clannad ~After Story~ is really one of the strong points of the show. Most high school romance animes always end in the main couple getting together and then its happily ever after. However After Story break out of this spiral and shows that life is not all smiles and happy times after high school. One of the charms of the story onthis season is how real it feels, Tomoya and Nagisa's lives as they enter the working society and struggles of everyday life is shown perfectly here, and it also shows you the unity and importance of family. Its a really refreshing feel that sets After Story on a different field from A LOT of other shows of the same genre.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Althought the first couple of episodes had a small animation decline for KyoAni standards, once again I am left extremely satisfied with the look of the show. The colors, animation, backgrounds, they are all done perfectly well and makes Clannad ~After Story~ a very graphically beautiful show. There is really nothing much to say here.\\n\\n\r\nSound: This is one of the show's best aspects, using the original soundtracks from the visual novel it was based on, and combined with the various touching moments that you encounter on After Story. You really get to appreciate the wonderful musical pieces that the Key Sound Label has composed. This is an example of good music used at the right times to create a beautiful sounding show. Also hat goes off to Nakamura Yuichi for his role as Tomoya.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Clannad has been praised by their wonderful characters, and After Story continues to further develop those characters. However past the high school timeline, some people might be a little let down as all the other Clannad heroines are reduced to little side character with limited screen time with the exception of Nagisa of course. On the positive side we are treated to how Nagisa and specially Tomoya are forced to change and mature in order to deal with the world of adult society, and also on the responsibilities of parenthood. After Story manages to do what not every anime can do and that is give you very \"real\" characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I liked After Story, even though it lacked on the comedy department which made the first season of Clannad so enjoyable. This season brought its own charms. It did kinda feel slow paces sometimes but the last couple of episodes makes it worth it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It is sad to see the entire Clannad series end...however, Clannad ~After Story~ is an excellent sequel and conclusion to a great series. Needless to say fans of the first season will absolutely love this and I really recommend everyone to watch this show, it really makes you realize the true value of family and friends and it is also one of the better animes that you can watch.",

Everything from the character development, to the soundtrack, to the main story overall. If you watched the first season, watching After Story is a definite must. Trust me, I didn't think the After Story was going to hit me as hard as it did, because of the lightheartedness of the first season. Character-wise, all the characters are very lovable, and you will get attached to all of them. The MC is a very strong character, a character I would like to see more in other characters inother anime. The story will make you appreciate the people around you in real life more, it made me change the way I looked at my own family and friends, enjoying their company, and being around me (yes I am serious). The soundtrack is very, very memorable. If an anime contains a soundtrack where the viewer would physically search up to listen to as music, it is very important. The soundtrack of this anime ties perfectly to each scene, and gives perfect emotion towards the viewer. I went back and listened to the track \"Snowfield\" on YouTube many times, and it still puts me in a trance, remembering every detail in the show. The only thing that was not a 10, was the art style, which I gave an 8. It wasn't horrible, but the way the eyes were drawn on the girls didn't make me take the show seriously at first glance (glad I ignored that and watched of course). As a whole, this is an anime you must watch, regardless of anything other people say, or scored. Clannad is not just a show, it's an experience.",

            "content": "im literally shaking and crying rn like it's not even funny\r\nWow, all I can say about this season is that it was a rollercoaster of emotions. It not only met but exceeded all of my expectations, but managed to make me feel, which hasn't happened since I watched Violet Evergarden a while ago. That deserves its own merit in itself.\r\nStory: Unlike the first season, this portion of the Clannad story does have a heavy focus on the story, and it shows. The show starts off on its happy note from the first season, with Tomoya and Nagisa both in a happy relationship. The events soonshift from happy to sheer depression in the span of only one episode. Everything leading up to that moment is fun filled Clannad antics, like everything that happens over at the Furukawa bakery. However, most of the genius that is the show occurs after the dreaded episode 16. It's what happens next that allows you to be shook and crying. However, most of that will have to be discussed in the character portion. The events that occur in this season build the characters, even more than the first does. Just as a warning, please bring tissues for episodes 16-21 (you have been warned).\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art pretty much stays the same as the first season, except with some updated visuals and better blending. I can't say much here, except for that the visuals within the extremely depressing scenes really help the show, with the fact that they make you focus on the character as they're the only one to focus on. The white background is actually a great idea, as there aren't any distractions that you could focus on. You're focused on the moment, which brings a whole new layer of emotions in.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Standard. If you read my first season review, it's practically the same thing, except for the fact that character emotions have another layer due to how real the problems that they face with are. No longer are the problems more shallow and not life threatening, but are real and have large impact. Also, the op is actually amazing, and the ed just eases you out of your depression after the last episodes. One of the episodes even does a seemless transition to it with its animation, which I found to be a nice little bonus.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I have lots to say about this section. After Story deals with character development at a scale that the first season doesn't touch. You start out with characters that you already like and are attached to, and it only grows as you progress through the episodes. You feel the struggles that Tomoya goes through, and the sadness he goes through is real. You also feel the changes that each and every character goes through throughout the series. Akio becomes a gag character, and learns to deal with the fact that his daughter is growing closer to Tomoya, and that he must soon adapt to changes while cherishing the time he has with his daughter. Meanwhile, you see changes in our main character himself, especially as he progresses through the story. Already at the beginning, he's different from the beginning of the entire series. You can tell his relationship with Nagisa and his friends have changed him from being a bum to a loving and caring person. He doesn't love school, but everything he's gone through with his friends has made him realise that he does need to change in order to support his growing relationship with Nagisa. This goes even further when you look at the changes in the rest of the story. He changes as he realises that he must work even harder and to change his lifestyle in order to not just support Nagisa, but his future. Even if there are less characters from the first season having an impact, the charm of the show doesn't dissipate. Hell, I'd say that it helps the show's charm seeing how less characters lets Tomoya develop even more as a character. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This show is basically exactly what I wanted for a sequel, and more. I'd write more here, but try writing through tears. You can't.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you don't watch this show, you're a monster. Do it. Now. Bring tissues too. I can see why this show is so highly rated.",

            "content": "After Story has ended. (Yes I know there is a special episode remaining but I think its safe to say that the story arc has \"officially\" ended.) And as promised, I'm updating my review on arguably one of the most excellent (and tearjearking ) anime I've seen thus far.\r\nStory (Based on School Arc) :\r\nContinues after the ending of Clannad when Nagisa and Tomoya are dating. This is all done in the space of 9 episodes. While the story is really good and fun, I just can't help it but feel that the producers rushed through the arc when Nagisa is sick. I mean, isn't thereanything interesting that happens when Nagisa is on her sickbed? Not that it matters, but they have the potential to show us more about Tomoya's school life with Nagisa out of the picture. Not a huge gripe, but a gripe nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\n(Based on After Story Arc):\\n\r\nThis arc tells the story of Tomoya's relationship with Nagisa as the two lovebirds starts living with each other and (inevitably) get engaged, then married. This arc is by far more serious than anything Clannad has shown us. And when I mean more serious, I mean crying your eyes out serious. After Story is NOT a tale of butterflies, sunshine and unicorns (well...there is a slight amount of them), its about the trials Tomoya has to go through when tragedy strikes him and how he fares with it. KyoAni has adapted the visual novel almost perfectly in the sense that they are able to capture the emotional state of the moment when Tomoya faces his great loss, and his eventual acceptance of being a responsible father towards his child that he has neglected for 5 years. The slight gripe about After Story is the same as the gripe I had with the School Arc. They did some time lapsing in and between episodes so one moment Nagisa has just discovered that she got pregnant, the next moment, she's in labour. Regardless of the time lapse, the story still flows smoothly enough that anyone can easily ignore it.\\n\\n\r\nArt (Both School and After Story Arcs):\\n\r\nStill as beautiful as the original series and sometimes even more so. Nuff Said.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (School Arc):\\n\r\nPersonally, I prefer the OP and ED music on this more than the original. But feel free to say otherwise as I know that music preferences varies between one another. Oh..the OP tune got stuck in my head for about 3 months now.\\n\\n\r\n(After Story Arc):\\n\r\nI gotta say, that I'm impressed with the some of the scores in the series. KyoAni really knows how to set the mood with the scores in Clannad. The music melds with the scene on the screen in such a way that it actually amplifies the character's sorrow/happiness. Examples of such scenes can be found in Episodes 16 and 18. There are more examples but I'll just leave them out for you to find out. On a side note, the ED music also infamously ruined the mood set by the ending of an episode so its a real shame that KyoAni didn't decide to switch the ED music for just one episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (School Arc):\\n\r\nMost of the characters are still here (Fuko is not seen....yet) doing what they do best. Other characters also get their background fleshed out which is cool as many shows I have watched just ignore the supporting casts. However, the characters that make me watch Clannad in the first place are getting less screentime as the School Arc ends (Nagisa and Tomoya are NOT my favorite characters btw) so its a shame.\\n\\n\r\n(After Story Arc):\\n\r\nEven though Nagisa and Tomoya are not my favorite characters, they have been greatly developed throughout the episodes. You may even begin to empathize with Tomoya when he marches on with life even though his life has just went through hell. As for other characters...well...you'll see a lot of Akio, Sanae and Yoshino while the girls from school make more of a cameo appearence than a supporting role. Matter of fact, Tomoyo is completely absent from the arc. Fuko returns near the end of the series and that is either a good thing or a bad thing depending on your feelings for her.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (School Arc):\\n\r\nThis anime has much LOL moments in the first 9 episodes. Episode 10 has LOL moments as well, but then it lacks that certain charm that makes the first 9 episodes so endearing to watch. Perhaps its just me, but I prefer an extended School Arc before moving on to After Story (again, the School Arc seemed rushed)\\n\\n\r\n(After Story Arc):\\n\r\nThis is the part where Clannad gets serious. There is a sharp decline in LOL moments, replaced instead by sad/touching moments. These moments would trigger anyone who has a heart to cry, be it sobbing or all out wailing. I never actually cried when a major plot was portrayed, but even I had trouble holding in the tears when one scene portrayed a hugely touching moment that I couldn't help but cry. Also, I'd like to point out that said scene is THE MOST TOUCHING SCENE I HAVE EVER WITNESS THUS FAR! I enjoyed it immenely, however the same cannot be said to those who think that this anime is far too emotional.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis is one of the best anime I have ever watched. Its one of the most emotional one I have ever watched. KyoAni deserves a standing ovation for being able to recreate the visual novel without losing the emotional parts that is crucial to this anime's success. Case in point, if you like the original Clannad, you must watch this (though I'd suggest you bring along a couple of tissues). If you like emotional animes, then watch this. (Though I suggest you watch its prequel followed by this sequel instead of jumping right into After Story, since you might not be able to connect with the characters then.)",

            "content": "Note: This review will be updated every 6 episodes:\r\nThe sequel to one of the most well known anime series Clannad maintains the high quality of animation, sound and dialogue of the original. In short, if you enjoyed the original Clannad, you will most definitely enjoy this sequel. While the execution of Clannad After story leaves little for complaint, it is somewhat hindered by the storyline' apparent lack o direction.\r\nWhile the original Clannad featured a number of Arcs, it was tied together by an overarching plot of setting up the main protoganist with Nagisa. The main plot also had an effective metaphor wih respect to themysterious girl and her junk doll in the mystery world. In constrast, episodes in the After Story so far appear a little less cohesive. This is, for example, reflected by the rather weak episode, which seemed more appopraite as a filler, rather than the launch of a new series. This lack of an overarching plot makes after story seem rather aimless.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, after story is still an excellent anime. The character animations are second to none, and the individual episodes are filled with both humour and moments tht grapple with your emotions. Even if the show does not seem to be heading anywhere, I still found it fund to watch.\\n\\n\r\nWill After story be as great as its predecessor? That will be depend on how the series progresses. Even if it maintains it current status quo, it'll still be better than most animes out there.",

            "content": "The Series\r\n[Rating:10/10]\r\nClannad ~ After Story ~ Complete Second Season picks up from where this anime adaptation of the visual novel left off after the first season. The characters are now concerned about graduating from high school and moving on with their lives. Nagisa and Tomoya are firmly a couple and soon, as Tomoya graduates and Nagisa once again suffers from illness and must repeat her senior year, the two find themselves in the real world dealing with real life issues. Moving forward with his life together with Nagisa, Tomoya, who was so adept at helping out his friends in high school with their troubles, realizeshe is not so skilled at working out his own problems.\\n\\n\r\nWith the same beautiful animation that defined the first season, an even more beautiful tale is woven in Clannad ~ After Story ~ one that is charming, sweet, and heartbreaking. The characters all grow tremendously and reflect the universal truths that we all know and experience \u2013 love, loss, fear, anxiety, and the pressure to succeed.\\n\\n\r\nVideo Quality\\n\\n\r\n[Rating:9/10]\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe gorgeous animation for Clannad ~ After Story ~ is given a strong AVC/MPEG-4 1080p encodement on Blu-ray from Sentai Filmworks. Although the purposeful, ethereal, \u201cmilky\u201d veneer that permeates the image sometimes seems to soften the detail, it never distracts or ruins the enjoyment of the series. Lie art mostly clear, and no motion artifacts or aliasing are detectable.\\n\\n\r\nAudio Quality\\n\\n\r\n[Rating:9/10]\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nLike the original series, Clannad, in both its original Japanese and English dub, has a subtle and atmospheric lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (48kHz/24-bit) soundtrack that is nicely balanced between the front and surround channels, has clean dialogue and a good amount of dynamic range. It is open and airy with a natural midrange, but there isn\u2019t much in the way of low frequencies. That doesn\u2019t harm the sound, however, as the mix works very well for the material.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\n[Rating:9.6/5]",

Those of you who think you have a black heart or iron heart, stand up and watch this series...\r\n\"Real men cry to Clannad Afterstory\", or so that message goes. To be frank, it's made up.\r\nANYWAYS! This anime was a journey... A hell of a journey. Almost reality grounded, and I fricking loved it. I sat through each episode after the first season and began my journey on this. To sum it up, here it is:\r\nI smiled several times, I laughed, I had fun, yet sometimes,I cried due to how invested I was into these characters.\\n\r\nStory: 8.8/10. A continuation after the last season. We watched as our characters grew up and their hardships as they formed bonds over time. I found this series genuine, as I lost any words to speak while watching it. It had something really confusing, but thanks to those that played the VN or had found out about it were able to explain it to me, I was able to understand the series and how it went.\\n\r\nArt: 9.7/10. It was able to convey to me visually without any audio or any subtitle; I was able to understand most of it just on visuals. It touched my heart just seeing this.\\n\r\nSound: 9.5. Good OST. It was able to make me cry and laugh sometimes. I really want to forget this and go on the feels train again.\\n\r\nCharacter: 9.9/10. I don't know what to say... It just... Felt amazing... I watched as they grew up and found what they wanted. I just... invested myself into the characters, and I grew to love them. It just felt so heartwarming for some scenes, yet it felt so sad to see it.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.7/10. What a feels trip and a great story. I love it.\\n\r\nOverall: 9.8/10. I recommend it, and I dearly hope you enjoy it. Suggestions for it are bringing a comfort blanket, a water bottle to fill with your tears, and some tissue boxes...",

Made me cry about 7 times (something i rarely do even once). This anime transcends good. The show may feel a little too moe but it didn't matter in the slightest after an episode or two. The one anime i reckon every animefan must try once. Music, while nothing spectacular like something Deathnote, are placed perfectly and fit the scenes perfectly, I still cry after listening to just the soundtrack.

Beginning with the same fun antics as seen in the original,the plot takes a deeper, more mature take on the Clannad cast. Focusing in on life after school, the trials of the real world is portrayed with emphasis on Tomoya. The flurry of comedy, along with appearances from Sunohara and friends begin to slim but its expected for them to return.\\n\\n\r\nART: Art is epicly amazing as usual (well it is KyoAni lol). There seems to be a little more CG effects this time around but nothing that really stands out or takes away from the character and background designs. The big shiny detailed eyes each character has is still my favorite aspect of the animation. I did sorta notice they used more of a darker tone of colors this time.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The only characteristic that I'm not really impressed with. The opening is not the greatest or the most catchiest but its there and it suits the anime for the most part. I kinda wished for a little bit more of an upbeat tempo but I'm still getting used to it ^_^ The ending song isn't bad but, still not enough to make me stop fast forwarding past it &gt;_&lt; Ill probably get hooked to the songs eventually so don't take my opinion for this too seriously.Surprisingly the creators decided to use the same background music from the first season but then again it can change the mood of the story in an instant.  \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: Not as much character development as would be expected half way through the series but it does provide fun and deep character interactions. The emotional hurdles are probably going to be seen in the second half but so far, I've been able to laugh at least once per  episode and been able to see some semi dramatic scenes.  \\n\\n\r\nENJOIMENT: The show hasn't given me any like &quot;whoa&quot; or &quot;wtf&quot; moments yet but, I'm sure that this series will leave me in awe @_@ when it's all over. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: The jokes and the famous character interactions are there just like in the original series. Hopefully the series will continue to develop without overwhelming us with the fantasy aspect and not sacrificing any quality with a sequel that came before Haruhi's. ^_^\\n\\n\r\nRecommendation: If you liked the original series watch this for sure. And if you liked this watch Toradora or Nodame Cantabile's sequel as they both are coming out at the same time as Clannad. \\n\\n\r\nIf you disagreed OR agreed fully with me on anything feel free to message me and discuss it. Always fun. @_@\\n\\n\r\nWoofWoof",

            "content": "\"The heartbreak and triumph of the masterful conclusion to one of the most beloved anime series ever.\"\r\nClannad ~After Story~ is a charming roller-coaster of emotions ...and you certainly have heard that before.\r\nUsing figures of speech isn't the best way to describe something in detail. However, for this franchise the rule does not apply, because the focus of Clannad's story is on people, their relationships and their feelings. The story itself acts like a living being, suffering changes and progressing step by step alongside characters, creating something curious, because this symbiosis develops so well and so smoothy that saying it is charming, beautiful, endearing, heartbreaking andall these adjectives become the most accurate way to describe it.\\n\r\nIt's a story that is easy to get attached to, something that's hard to find in some generic romance/drama anime where, most of the time, characters seem patterned or act in unnatural ways. Clannad brings such realistic situations that most of the people who watch can really put themselves in the characters' shoes. Maybe because they've been through situations like that in their lives before or just because the story becomes endearing to a point anyone could feel sympathetic with it.\\n\\n\r\nThe following is mostly focused on story and characters. If you want a quick resume, jump to the Final Considerations;\\n\\n\r\n\"Clannad\" is an old Irish word for \"family\" and, of course, it's no coincidence. This series' theme and focus, besides all those mentioned above, is indeed the importance of family. But not only the orthodox definition of family, composed of parents and a child, what is beautiful in Clannad is that it expands this idea to all the circles of people's lives and all kinds of \"families\". The circle of friends you're in, your work, college and even the community you're inserted in, just like a whole city is a large family of people who interact with each other. \\n\r\nDoesn't it remind you of the Dango Daikazoku? While paying attention to the lyrics, one can get an accurate view of the story. \\n\\n\r\nJust like that, the After Story manages to go beyond the first season, where it appeared that the moral of the story was limited to expressing the importance of friends and relationships in general.\\n\r\nConsidering that you, reader, have already watched the first season, you might have heard that it was based on a Visual Novel and that both seasons were originally part of the same game. However, in Nagisa's route, the story became too deep and emotionally charged, so the production staff decided to divide it.  When the animation came out, the same happened, leaving for the first series a more easygoing mood in a school slice-of-life scenario, but giving the After Story a chance to sacrifice a bit of this atmosphere and the  comedy side of the show in order to effectively build up its emotional appeal, reinforcing the series' central theme and spicing it with a bittersweet drama/romance. \\n\r\nBecause, in the end, After Story's focus is, in fact, telling the bittersweetness of Tomoya's life. \\n\r\nIt resumes old plot questions that were left open when the 1st season ended and shows Tomoya and Nagisa's relationship progressing, while their friends move on with their lives. It goes all the way from finishing high-school to entering the \u201cadult world\u201d and facing new adversities and challenges, finally giving a solid conclusion, different from the \u201cThey lived happy after ever\u201d we're used to.\\n\r\nThat's also why most of the \u201cplot holes\u201d and flaws stayed behind in the first season, leaving few and small issues for this one in a way that isn't even worth mentioning. \\n\r\nBut, saying that a 24 episode series tells the story of a person's life isn't too much?\\n\r\nThat's why I mean it in the symbolic way, the philosophical meaning of the beginning of a world, of a life, not in the biological sense.  After all, doesn't a life start when it is given a meaning, an objective? \\n\r\nEspecially that first encounter between Tomoya and Nagisa. It holds a meaning beyond the \u201cboy meets girl\u201d setup, but is only revealed in After Story.\\n\\n\r\nThe division of episodes into \"arcs\" is the same, even though, since the focus in now on the couple, we barely see Yohei, Kyou or Kotomi, for example, in the later episodes.\\n\r\nStill on the matter of characters, Fuko fans will rejoice to know she has some appearances this season -although more as a tension reliever than anything- which becomes pretty obvious when you notice her arc in the story ended long ago and that her scenes are now just a manner producers found to break the melodramatic mood. The downside of this is that a character who used to have depth becomes flat and somewhat of an outcast in the middle of all the serious events. Those who didn't notice this probably stayed confused and annoyed by her suddenly and completely random appearances.\\n\r\nThe same thing happens with some episodes between arcs. Have you ever heard of breather episodes? That's what people like to call the episodes placed between or after heavy emotional sections of the story, letting the viewer relax a bit. However, with Clannad, it was a bit different. The responsibility for those moments was placed on Fuko's character, and the breather episode took a completely different setting. This quote from TvTropes explains it: \\n\r\n\"It's odd to consider the first episode of a season as a breather episode, but episode 1 of ~After Story~ certainly qualifies. After the power of the end of the first season, and before all of the nuclear powered emotional scenes later in ~After Story~, it starts with the cast... playing baseball.\"\\n\\n\r\nThat's why Clannad doesn't work for everybody. \\n\r\n-It's worth leaving a warning here rather than regret not doing it later.-\\n\r\nFans of action packed thrillers or strong dramas where everybody dies and there's a bunch of gore or bloodshed won't be entertained by Clannad, and probably will drop it right away. Clannad is a psychological drama, that requires some interpretation and a lot of attention, but at the same time it is CUTE, filled with CUTE characters in a charming and calm environment. There are no bad words, no FANSERVICE, no fights, no bankruptcy, no thieves, it's indeed an utopia, a \"Lovely Drama\" after all ...if that is even possible. \\n\r\nCan't the skeptics appreciate the beauty of it?\\n\r\nIt's kind of useless saying it in the 2nd season review, but considering that some people might read this before watching the first season, keep in mind that this is a romance, that develops into a very emotional packed drama, and it has a lot of references to Japanese culture, habits, and especially relationships in the sense of \"interaction\". And this is something that always appears in discussion forums, the physical interaction between characters, most notorious between Nagisa and Tomoya, questions such as \"why can't they kiss?\" or \"wth? not even a hug?\" are common complaints.\\n\r\nActually, it's supposed to be like that. This is one of the series' objectives, showing that people can express their love with passion in different and meaningful ways that aren't restricted to hugs, kisses and some other R+ rated things...\\n\r\nThis is one of the main reasons it's also easily recommended as \u201cfamily entertainment\u201d, meaning, it's a series you won't feel awkward if someone steps in while you're watching. Kids could watch it, and even though they wouldn't get the undertones, would still be able to appreciate it.\\n\r\nYes! As you probably noticed so far, it's filled with subtext and symbolism. \\n\r\nIt's a Key/Visual Arts anime after all, what were you expecting?\\n\\n\r\nI said it is charming in many ways, didn't I? \\n\r\nFirst of all, the artwork is astonishingly beautiful and character design doesn't stray behind. KyoAni makes sure to -again- prove why they are one of the companies with the best illustration artist of the industry. \\n\r\nClannad has been considered before to be one of the best \"bishoujo animes\" ever released, meaning, you won't find a female character that looks \"ugly\" (even beauty being a relative thread). Actually, not even a single cat could be considered ugly in this series.  \\n\r\nSome scenery look like they were removed from a painting and even some dishes look delicious to eat when zoomed in. Particle effects animation for things such as rain and cherry blossom-gales was carefully conduced creating really astonishing scenes and effects. One will surely recall the first scene of the anime on the school hill when talking about visual effects. The amount of color, brightness, highlights and undertones in some scenes really helped to bring feelings up and set the environment.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack, the OST is majestic just like the one for the first season was. With calm and gentle pieces for the sadder moments but also funky and happy synthetic compositions for the easygoing moments.\\n\r\nThe seiyuus chosen for the main characters were also perfect choices. Nagisa's seiyuu, Mai Nakahara, with her calm and gentle voice, really helped creating comforting and relaxing dialogues together with Yuuichi Nakamura's strong and more serious voice of Tomoya. It was a perfect match.\\n\r\nNice to mention, the English version licensed by Sentai which contains the dubbed ver. is also great. The voice actors chosen have similar vocal characteristics from the originals, the only thing that (for me) is a downside of dubbed versions is the loss of the honorifics after the names (e.g: Tomoya-kun).\\n\\n\r\nRegarding sound and artwork, it's impossible to forget the opening sequence. Not just for the music, but also for the way the scenes were organized and which ones were selected. That OP by itself is a masterpiece. \\n\r\nAn interesting thing about it is that it spoils the entire series. However, it does it in a way you will only notice after you finish watching. Then, if you aren't surprised enough, watch again the first opening for the first season and behold more hidden heavy plot spoilers!\\n\r\nStill, in an imperfect world not everything is perfect, and the Ending theme was sure a miscast. Its lively and happy nature fit the first episodes pretty well, but from the middle of the series onwards it was a horrible mood killer. Unlike Dango Daikazoku that was a \"neutral\" ending theme, this one couldn't possibly look good after a strong dramatic scene. It almost seems like somebody is making fun of you for getting emotional with the episode. \\n\r\nIt completely demolishes all the melodramatic atmosphere the last scenes created to a way that after a while, it becomes healthier to stop the playback before it starts if you don't want to get mad with it. Any other song with a slower pace, or even a calm and gentle vocal piece, would be a better ED for the series than this one. \\n\r\nThat said, this completely removes one point from the \"Sound\" rating of the series.\\n\\n\r\nFinal considerations;\\n\\n\r\nIf you're planning on skipping the first season and only watching this one, don't do it. You'll lose so many things that nothing of the After Story will make sense. After all, it's the AFTER story, you need the STORY in order to properly interpret things. Duh.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is great about Clannad is that it doesn't force emotions on you.\\n\r\nUnlike other series where every single little thing is an excuse to bring up sad violin pieces and show characters crying all over the place, Clannad kind of \"warns\" you when a sad moment is coming. You can feel it approaching but end up playing along without even noticing because even though you know it's heartbreaking you also know it will get a conclusion and that this is part of the path, not just a random tear-jerking scene. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime isn't like a summer story. We've accompanied these characters through a whole part of their lives and it's sad to say goodbye. It's sad to let go. This is the kind of series that someone will always cherish, with characters that make you want to look after them, wish them a happy life. If the first season made you tear up, then After Story will too. With such a beautiful ending, even the most cynical would shed a tear. \\n\r\nIt is a masterpiece not only on the numeric score, on the drama topic or the romance side, but as a complex symphony of story, sound, voice acting, subtext, art, design, with all instruments together, resonating in a pattern of vibration even Kotomi's parents couldn't predict in their theory.\\n\r\nStory: 10 | Artwork: 10 | Sound: 8 | Characters: 9 | Enjoyment: 10 | Overall: 10.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, few shows rise to the levels this one does.",

            "content": "Just a friendly reminder:\r\nIf you read 10 reviews and didn't find anything helpful, either the reviews all suck or your reading comprehension sucks. Save yourself 10 minutes of reading and just mark this review unhelpful. If you haven't stopped reading, enjoy.\r\nPros: Top notch production value, engaging storyline, detailed characterization.\r\nCons: Lackluster ending, rough/nonexistent transition, mood-ruining ending song.\r\nEither/or: Different feel from first season; less comedy, more tragedy. Less focus on harem/romance as dictated from the storyline continuation. Cameos Few and far in between.\r\nA much more focused and engrossing storyline makes Clannad: After Story the best Kyoto Animation title thus far.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nLet's get the minor stuff out of theway first.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is top notch, with special attention paid to character design. Being a direct sequel to Clannad, the improvements will seem relatively minor; that's still no small feat, considering Clannad already feature some of the best character designs in the harem genre. The article below by Crisu is a great read comparing the eyes of several generations of KyoAni characters: http://cjblackwing.wordpress.com/2008/02/12/the-eyes-of-kyoto-animation/ It also serves as a reminder of how much the KyoAni style has matured over the years. There really are no corners cut here. Meticulous detail is put into each and every thing. Even characters that only appears for one scene are animated in great detail instead of the blurry or silhouette approach others take, while the background is full of vibrant scenery and landmarks based on real life models.\\n\\n\r\nKeeping with the tradition, most of the Seiyuu and BGM used in the anime are the same as the ones used in the original game. The voice acting is top notch, with characters sounding anywhere from convincingly stupid to mind-numbingly grievous depending on the situation. The background music, while fitting for the most part, does get a bit repetitive in some places. There have been a  number of official and doujin albums released in the 4 years prior to the After Story animation, and it would have added more variety to incorporate some of these tunes to the fray. The biggest change easily comes from the new opening and ending, both sung by Lia.Toki wo Kizamu Uta is easily one of the memorable anime opening songs ever. It's an arrangement and vocalization of another Clannad track, To the Same Heights, which also happens to be one of my favorite Clannad songs. On the other hand, Torch, the ending theme, feels way too energetic and out of place. Even though the Dango song isn't my cup of tea, it is much more fitting and should have taken the place of Torch here.\\n\\n\r\nOnwards to the bulk of the review.\\n\\n\r\nClannad: After Story is a bit of a misnomer. Being the direct continuation of the first season, instead of starting the After Story arc right off the bet, the first few episodes followed the same \"mini-arc\" format that KyoAni has used since Air, much to my disappointment. The approach makes the gap between the arcs seem unnatural and segments a series too much to fully explore an engaging storyline in depth. The saving grace comes from the fact that these are dedicated to the supporting cast in the first season, which is a nice change of pace. The fact that the protagonist isn't romantically involved with any of these characters also makes the transition a bit smoother.\\n\\n\r\nThe second portion(about 2/3) of the anime is dedicated to the After Story, basically a direct continuation of the Nagisa arc where Tomoya starts to date her. Many consider this to be the meat and gem of the original game and it's not hard to see why. It is one of the most emotional stories ever crafted, and romance doesn't even play a big part in it! It is also here when Clannad really bombards the audience with its central theme: Family. With as many as 3 concurrent tales at any given time, Clannad: After Story is one emotional roller coaster after another, only climbing uphill all the way until the climax. The only breaks come in forms of the sparse cameo appearances of former Clannad cast, in events such as Christmas and New Year gatherings.\\n\\n\r\nThen, once again, KyoAni drops the balls again. Because of After Story's intense and focused buildup, it's really easy to forget KyoAni's biggest weakness : Transitions. First few episodes featured arcs that coexisted relatively independently and harmlessly, while the After Story just keeps building on itself Until the end. Traditionally, what KyoAni has done in the past is to just drop down the next arc or alternative and expects you to move right along, which is both its greatest strength and downfall in forms of faithful adaptation and plot segregation. This time, however, KyoAni favored an altered presentation and an attempt to incorporate the true ending to the existing After Story ending, an attempt which fell flat on its face. It's just as confusing as if the two were left alone, and the new approach left more questions than answers. However, I do applaud KyoAni for finally making a change. Segmented arc presentation has always been my biggest gripe with KyoAni adaptations, and it's nice to see something being done about it. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the shortcoming in the plot device, the art direction and cinematography during the end sequence is among the best in the entire series, which should be fulfilling enough for those who are just relieved that the ride is over. Hopefully KyoAni will not be discouraged by this result and continue to experiment to find the perfect presentation for their future works. Despite the less-than-revolutionary storyline and the obtuse ending, Clannad: After Story is possibly the most moving tale to ever focus on family, with only Grave of the Fireflies as a possible contender.",

            "content": "(Be aware that i'm pretty new to making reviews, and my english is not perfect)\r\nI knew that CLANNAD: After Story would be sad, but nothing could prepare me for what to come. I watched trough CLANNAD some days before i watched After Story so it was still fresh in my mind.\r\nSTORY: 10/10\r\nThe story starts like any \"CLANNAD\" episode or arc. The same humor and the same heartfelt moments, however, after a certain point everything changes. That's when this show really shines.  It's not a humorous show anymore. It's depressing. The whole first season of \"CLANNAD\" and the first half of \"After Story\" builds upuntil this point which makes it so much more sad. You feel like you're a part of these people's lives, but then something happens and you feel empy inside.\\n\r\nHowever, the ending will probably be confusing for alot of people, so i urge you to pay attention. If you're still confused then go on the internet and search for answears.\\n\r\nI have to be honest and say that i didn't like the ending first time around. But after some time, and thinking, i started to really like and appreciate the ending for what it was.\\n\\n\r\nART: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI was pretty unsure if this show deserved a 10/10 regarding art, but after some thinking i made up my mind. I can admit that the character design is not flawless, alot of people look alike, which can be annoying. Some people didn't like how \"moe\" everything looked, but i had no problems with it.\\n\r\nFor its time, the scenery looked absolutely amazing, especially the scenes with the girl and the robot. The world felt alive.\\n\r\nThe cgi was also on point. It was really impressive and it holds up to this day. It was not alot of cgi but it was there.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this show is outstanding. Let's begin with the openings and endings before we move on to the OST.\\n\r\nThe opening of CLANNAD: After Story is simply amazing. It's not only amazing to look at but also to listen to. It fits the show perfectly.\\n\r\nI can't say to much for the ED since i usually skip it, but it was pretty solid. I would say that i prefer the ED from the original CLANNAD since it was more emotional.\\n\r\nThe OST is also really good, amazing actually. It can make a sad scene into a outright cryfest. My favourite are \"Roaring Tides 1&2\" and \"Nagisa\".\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf this show didn't have great characters then alot of the emotional scenes wouldn't have the same impact. The two main characters are Tomoya and Nagisa, i really like Tomoya as a character, Nagisa was great too but she isn't my favourite.\\n\r\nThe show has some great supporting characters too, some of them are for comic relief but most of them moves the plot forward.\\n\r\nSunohara and Akio are two really funny characters but they are also well written and important for the story.\\n\r\nIt says alot when you get sad when some of the supporting casts leaves for a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile alot of people would call CLANNAD & After Story boring, i really can't. Even the less eventful first season had me watching episode after episode, not wanting to stop. CLANNAD: After Story is more eventful than the first season so alot of people will find it more enjoyable.\\n\r\nIt's really funny at times so there's that.\\n\r\nI would say that the reason that the show keeps me watching is the characters. I want to see them succeed. I will say that after a certain episode, i felt so emty inside and sad so i felt like i couldn't watch more, but i did. I still finished the show the same day.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI'm pretty sure you saw this coming, and what can i say? i love this anime. I could even say that it's the best anime i have ever watched in my entire life. It's so close to my heart. Just hearing the music from the show can tear me up sometimes. It's a show i love to think about even tough it makes me tear up. It felt like a journey, i felt like i was a part of their lives, even tough i was in my bedroom staring at my phone.\\n\r\nI urge you to watch this show if you like to cry, and believe me, you will most likely shed a tear. The closest anime to hit me on an emotional level similar to CLANNAD: After Story was Koe No Katachi (Amazing movie btw). It made me happy, sad and satisfied at the same time.\\n\r\nI recommend watching CLANNAD: After Story right after finishing the original CLANNAD, as it will make you feel like you're a part of their lives more, the emotional scenes will most likely be greater....\\n\\n\r\n---RECOMMENDATIONS---\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to watch something similar to this show then you really like crying.\\n\r\nI would personally recommend \"Anohana\". It's a touching story about a group of friends that tries to fulfill their dead friend's final wish. It has some great characters, a very good soundtrack and a touching story.",

            "content": "\" Tears are how our heart speaks when our lips cannot describe how much we've been hurt. \" - Jellal Fernandes\r\nClannad: After Story is a master of deception. It lures us in with promising fairytale love story full with laughter and quirky characters, showing how happy a family can be and the fun to share with friends, only to leave us behind crying with tears that we cannot stop. \r\nThe story centers around Ozakazi and Nagisa with their love story and the struggles that they have been through, all the fun moments in their school, with both her parents, with their friends and the sad,emotional moments that they've both shedded their tears to. Up till here, the intro and OST are to be complimented as each little story in this quiet city is unfolded, their sad past behind them and their mystical charm, portraying their memory as a story to us, little by little, the small stories and the pain that they had been through behind their bright smile.\\n\\n\r\nWhat strikes me the most is the realistic portrayal of the story and their interaction, how the city changes and how life moves on wherever you stood or whatever you choose, and sometimes, we just wish for a little miracle to happen in our life. To Ozakazi, Nagisa is his miracle and loved her so much that he thinks they shouldn't have met for what comes after. A smile or a hug to pull him away from doing something stupid, being on the edge of crying thinking of how alone he can be in his room and cheerful on the outside yet physically weak. He thinks of her as a gem, so precious that he doesn't want to lose it and so rare.\\n\\n\r\nMost people will cry up till certain point, and we cry because we want to. We can relate to the pain Okazaki felt and how deep he loves Nagisa when he will cry unconsciously whenever he thought of her name, we might have tried to smile to stop the tears from keep flowing but our heart just want to let it all out. All those built-up tears for that single moment in the sunflower field, where the sun sets and Okazaki hugging his daughter as their heart truly became one. The pain of losing someone that is so dearest and yet not being able to do anything to save them, the pain that is burning inside the heart yet undescribable where our lips can't move and our tears flow out to cover up the pain we had.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Clannad: After Story is not just some tear-jerking anime made up of random sad scenes, it's a slow build-up of a pure love story from the very first episode of Clannad. Even if you're not into romance, there are loads of comedy and entertaining scenes with the emphasis of love in many forms. But if you look closer, you'll find yourself crying in the end, for the beauty of their love and how powerful it can be.\\n\\n",

For anyone who enjoys romance shows but would still like to see an \"after story\" of you select romancees continue their relationship this is exactly what you're looking for. By far the most fulfilling, enjoyable, emotional, shows one could find. Barring the OVAs added to the 2nd season this is what one could call a masterpiece of a second season. It carried the same heart of the first butadded the whole real romance element to it. \\n\r\nWill always remain as my second favorite show and all time favorite romance.",

            "content": "First review, ahoy! Let's do this..\r\nPlease excuse my British spelling and potential blabbering :}\r\nBeing relatively new to anime compared to some, having only \"gotten into\" this scene in the past year or so, I had inevitably been advised to delve straight into more mainstream anime; Cowboy Bebop, Elfen Lied, The Melancholy of Whatserface.. Those sorts of things, all of which I enjoyed to different extents. I then decided to veer off into more obscure and lesser known titles, just to broaden my horizon. Unfortunately, this experience wasn't great; there's probably a solid reason why the things I watched actually are lesser known; either they possessa 50% chance of developing a wonderfully creepy incestuous relationship, or they're pretty much just complete and utter tripe. Or both. Gotta love Japan sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing this less-than-stellar experience, I decided to treat myself to couple of much loved modern classics: Clannad.. And then Clannad: After Story. \\n\\n\r\nIt's fair to say that this outstandingly crafted piece of work has had a telling impact on pretty much most people who have had the pleasure of watching it, some people have even gone as far to say that the emotion of the events in this series have changed the way that they will live their lives in the future. That really doesn't surprise me. So, why is this?\\n\\n\r\nStory: I've seen Clannad: After Story sometimes labelled \"anime's greatest love story\", which I would like to agree with. (However: I, and other people that claim such a thing may not have seen every love story going, so take it with a pinch of salt). The amazing thing is, however: it isn't solely about the love story between just two characters, it is about something more; the individual side characters' hardships and their underlying meanings, the friendships that develop (and the unforgettable one that was already developed: Tomoya and Youhei). And in the end, the show's main theme, \"the importance of family\" ultimately pulls through. The pacing of the story itself is quite odd - the first half of the series, which is dedicated to it's supporting character arcs, is quite slow and gradual, whereas the second half focus on the two main characters: Tomoya and Nagisa, accelerates from the deliberate and slow moving start with much faster-paced intent. The rapid change in pace is welcome and the slow start is most definitely NOT off putting in any way, though. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: Kyoto Animation, what more can I say? The animation is typically great by their own high standard, with a special mention to the animation in particular in the scenes that take place with \"the girl in the alternate world\", which is probably the most compelling and beautifully put together animation I've ever seen and will see in quite a while. The rest of the scenery is a slight step down from that, but still provides plenty of eye-candy. As much as I personally liked the character designs, I have seen some minor complaints about the possible \"unnecessary\" moe elements that were present, especially in Nagisa - who possesses the typical features of a \"kawaii~desu\" (or whatever) character, with her prominently large eyes and small, fragile demeanor. I think the \"unnecessary\" claim is somewhat invalid though, as her fragile body becomes a more important plot element than you might think. The rest of the character designs are refreshingly simple and just.. Pretty. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OP wasn't as good or memorable for me as OPs by other Key influenced works, such as Air and Angel Beats (I haven't seen Kanon as of this review), but that doesn't mean to say I didn't like it at all. It kicks off with a little bit of melodic piano work, and is then taken forward with a more full, poppy sound accompanied by powerful vocals sung by the ever talented Lia. Like many others, I was slightly disappointed with the abolition of the infectiously cute \"Dango Daikazoku\" ED from the first season. The ED for this season though was a good, more uplifting listen. One problem with the more uplifting nature of this ED was that it ranged from being slightly unfitting to infuriatingly inappropriate after the more intensely emotional episodes. The BGM in general perfectly fit the situations, and again, a special mention to the BGM in the scenes involving \"the girl from the alternate world\". Mystifying and wondrous. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is another aspect where Clannad: After Story shines. I believe there is at least one extremely likable and relatable character on show for even the most cynical of people. Firstly the main characters: the insecure, soft spoken and adorable Nagisa Furukawa and the brutally honest yet caring Tomoya Okazaki, who in my opinion is one of the best developed male leads I've seen in a while. The development of these mains couldn't have come about with the help it's great cast of supporting characters; especially the Furukawa family. Nagisa's mother, Sanae, who is beautiful and often mistaken for her older sister, is caring, constantly cheerful and the perfect mother figure. She also makes some notoriously ass-bad bread. My personal favourite character from the entire series is Akio, Nagisa's father. He is a big-talker and is playful, he's also often the main source of silly comic-relief (taking the place of Youhei from the first season). But he is dynamic: kind, sympathetic and deep down is a serious family man. He also plays baseball with the neighborhood kids in his spare time. What a man.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment/conclusion: For many people, the term \"enjoyment\" of this series can be easily translated to \"emotional impact\" or \"effect\" on those individuals, as many have shed at least a tear (or 50) experiencing this anime at it's dramatic peak, and only the most skeptical of souls will avoid developing any emotional feelings towards any of the characters; and what a great cast of characters it was. The series delivered for me in pretty much every single way, and even when I wasn't fully expecting it. After about episode 17, I was thinking to myself \"this is great, but I'd love to know more about Tomoya's father...\". Guess what? Delivered. Little things like that helped make it an almost perfect watch for me, and it's undoubted high prestige among anime fans isn't decieving. Clannad: After Story gives you just about everything: sporting a solid, developed story, the outstanding cast of characters, typically great animation, emotional impact and above all: entertaiment. This is why Clannad: After Story will be a fondly remembered and loved future classic for years to come.\\n",

You should let it all out while you still can... because when you get bigger, sometimes you can\u2019t cry, even if you have something to cry about.\"\r\nI watched this in the middle of 2012, during the summer. I had previously watched Clannad, the prequel to Clannad ~After Story~ and enjoyed it a lot, I thought that Key had made a pretty awesome story. Then I noticed there was a season 2, so I decided to watch it, but never in my life would I have expected to find something so life changing that day.Clannad ~After Story~, the one anime that has changed everyone's perspective of life as we know it. It was my absolute pleasure to watch this, and I probably haven't cried this hard in... well, ever. About everything in Clannad ~After Story~ was perfect, and when I say perfect, I mean flawless and extraordinary.\\n\\n\r\nThe story picks up off of Clannad. Nagisa and Tomoya are going out now, which was what everyone was wanting to see throughout the first season, and it was well worth the wait. Anyways, they're dating now, and they also seem to be helping more people with their problems, just like the first season. It wasn't until around episode 10 where the graduation starts where it started getting a lot more interesting, and a lot of stuff happens, some good things, some bad things, and then a few episodes later, the biggest, most heartbreaking thing occurs, and I can say that it hit me right in the feels. From there on out, I was constantly holding back tears from both happiness and sadness, no lie, it was hard for me not to cry while watching. In the end, I was a changed man. New perspective of life, new plan for my future, everything changed, and it was thanks to Clannad ~After Story~.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was flawless. Beautiful scenery, amazing character art, everything was spectacular, so colorful and amazing.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting, I'll tell you something, I'm guessing the voice acting won some awards somewhere on earth, it was filled with such realism. I loved everyone, they got some really good actors and actresses to take part in such a masterpiece, and I think that this may be what they're all most known for.\\n\\n\r\nNagisa, Tomoya, Sunohara, Akio, Sunai, everyone is in the show once again, and all of them are playing much larger roles. Out of all the characters in the show, my favorite would have been either Nagisa or (Spoiler, sorry, can't give you any names). Nagisa is the person everyone falls in love with, both friendship-wise and romance-wise. She's the perfect human being. Tomoya is wonderful, under all the depression he's lived with in his life, he's honestly an awesome person. He cares for others and always tries to help people. A wonderful role model. Sunohara is one of the bestest friends anyone could have, hilarious, he's pure awesome. Sunai and Akio are the parents everyone might find embarrassing at times, but they are the idle parents, caring for their children in every way possible. Wonderful cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many words that can describe Clannad ~After Story~, but the word I choose is \"Masterpiece\". I've shown this to multiple friends, even those who want nothing to do with anime, and all of them have loved it. This is honestly one of the greatest animes in history, and if you don't even show a hint of sadness or joy on your face in this show, go to the doctor, you might be sick, maybe even have a minor concussion, this show should change your life no matter what.\\n\\n\r\nI am asking those who have not seen this yet, please, watch it. You will not regret the time put into watching this, you have my word.",

            "content": "Kyoto Animations greatest strength is being able to create amazing characters, and then torturing with Supernatural happenings and in this case also; life itself. It's about friendship, growing up, love and loss. \r\nEverything about this anime is amazing, but if I have to say what is the best part about Clannad: After Story, It's it's characters.\r\nI think everyone would want a Tomoya as a husband, a Nagisa as a wife, an Akio as father-in-law, a Sanae as mother-in-law, Sunohara as your best friend, Mei as a little sister, Ushio as a daughter, Yoshino as a Colleague and in the end; even a Naoyuki as afather. \\n\\n\r\nTomoya is a huge role model for me, how awful his life might get he still keeps going. He has shown me how huge of a wuss I am. He cries a lot in this anime and I dont think he is less manly for it(Since I cried with him).I really enjoy the types of leads that are sarcastic trolls and gentlemanlike at the same time(Like Yuuichi from Kanon), which can lead to very humorous but also very dramatic moments.\\n\\n\r\nSome people might think the ending makes no sense, and to those people i say(I can't stand them): Pay attention!\\n\r\nThe anime gives hints to what is going to happen, Think of what happens after Tomoya helps Fuko, Kotomi, Yukine and Naoyuki but also the whole \"girl in the illusionary world\" arc.\\n\r\nIn my opinion the ending beautifully ties everything together, with help of the amazing song: \"Chiisana Te No Hira\", which I still cannot listen without getting goosebumps. Which also gives a great ending to the story of the relationship between Tomoya and his dad Naoyuki.\\n\\n\r\nClannad has changed my look on life for ever, And therefore I give it a 10/10, and have reserved the 10/10 slot on MAL for the series and only this series, because It's a different level of masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nI highly reccomend you watch it\\n\\n",

            "content": "*this review contain spoilers* \r\nI\u2019ll put a * around the category that contains major spoilers.\r\nOk here goes my 2nd anime review, and it\u2019s of probably my all time favorite anime. I\u2019m gonna go over each category and explain why this anime is by far the best romance anime ever made.\r\nStory-10\r\nI gave story a 10/10 because this really has an amazing story. With all the drama and romance and sadness it really pulls you into its icy cold grasps, every now and again it\u2019ll warm up a little but then it goes right back to being icy and cold. But that doesn\u2019t stop you from justabsolutely loving every moment of it. \\n\\n\r\nArt-8 \\n\r\nYou may be confused as to why I gave art an 8/10 which is still high but I gave everything else a 10 so why is there this lonely 8 we\u2019ll let me explain. This is clannad after story, which is obvious. So to really understand the characters and get to know them you need to watch Clannad. And I got to admit it took me 4 tries until on my 5th try I stuck with it and watched all of it.ill go into more detail in my clannad review but it was basically the art that made it hard for me to watch, so that\u2019s why it\u2019s an 8 even though they did a hell of a good job and now I absolutely love the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound-10 \\n\r\nMy god do I love the music and VA in this anime. I watch this is Dub which in my opinion is the better of the 2 version. Nagisa as that adorable high pitched voice that\u2019ll just melt your knees, Tomoya has the gruff kinda distant voice that\u2019lllet you know he\u2019s kinda a delinquent and an outcast. And I just think they did an awesome job on choosing their voices. Then you got the music and if it isn\u2019t some of the best anime music I\u2019ve ever heard. In some of the more sad parts the music is one of the main reasons you\u2019ll shed a tear. Don\u2019t get me wrong it\u2019s still sad but without that good old dango family song some scenes wouldn\u2019t hit nearly as hard as they did. This is one of the few anime where I actually looked up the soundtrack to it not just the op but all of it. And am I just so glad that the composer really understands that he\u2019s trying to make you cry. By playing reaccuring themes to get you to remember the characters and just hitting you right in the feels. And don\u2019t even get me started on that op, it just knows that it\u2019s trying to get you to cry every time you listen to it. It\u2019s like that\u2019s it\u2019s whole purpose.\\n\\n\r\n*Character*-10\\n\r\nOh boy this is gonna be a long ass section. Usually I want to focus on just the 2 main leads of the anime but I feel like there were a lot of characters I loved in this anime so I\u2019ll go over the ones I liked the most. This includes Tomoya Okazaki, Nagisa Furukawa, akio Furukawa, sanae Furukawa, ushio Okazaki, youhei sunohara, and kyou fujibayashi. I felt that all these characters were really important and I just enjoyed them all. So I\u2019ll start with Tomoya of course. And I\u2019ll go over these characters better I\u2019m my Clannad review(like who they are and stuff like that). I\u2019m this season Tomoya has really lighten up\u2019d he\u2019s smiling more he\u2019s looking at life better and he actually has something to live for(nagisa).\\n\r\nThis allows you to get even more character development for Tomoya from going to someone who doesn\u2019t really like people or you know life to a guy who just loves his wife and wants her to be happy. I\u2019ve always enjoyed watching this character grow up and become the man he needs to be for nagisa. Nagisa is next and what can I say for nagisa but she is the ultimate Waifu. She\u2019s adorable and just all around nice. Everything she does she does for the people she loves and she\u2019s just the best, that\u2019s the most I can say about nagisa. But she is pretty weak when it comes to illnesses always getting sick(spoiler heavy section up next skip to where I put end of you don\u2019t want to read this) ******and sadly dying from giving child birth which in my opinion is the saddest character death in any anime if you\u2019ve really gotten to love these characters and watched from the beginning. Nagisa dies and gives birth to the adorable little girl called ushio. She\u2019s a spitting image of her mother and acts like it too. She\u2019s a very well behaved little girl and an all around sweet heart. Even after not really seeing her father for 5 years she still loves him and wants to be with him, god she\u2019s just adorable*****.END Man this is getting really really long and if you\u2019ve kept reading all of This than I\u2019m honestly surprised anyways let\u2019s continue on to the side characters. Akio Furukawa which is nagisa\u2019s father is one of the most likable fathers in anime. He\u2019s still has the mind of a teenager, playing video games, playing baseball and dressing up to see his daughter at work. He honestly reminds me of my father and that probably why I love him so much. Sanae Furukawa is the ideal mother, calm, collected, and super helpful she is what gets Tomoya to open up more and she is one of the best characters of clannad after story just by how much she does for everyone. Youhei sunohara is the best friend of Tomoya and he\u2019s the comic relief of this drama heavy series. He does have a very nice arc in this season though that has to do with sisterly love and it honestly can hit hard because the ending and what he and Tomoya do I loved it and really let me like sunohara as a character more. And let\u2019s not forget the unforgettable moments with Tomoyo In season 1. And last but not least is kyou who is my favorite side character and I got to be honest I kinda ship her and Tomoya. After nagisa of course( spoiler )****** when nagisa is \u201cgone\u201d and Tomoya is alone I was honestly hoping kyou and him would get together they just seem so compatible and I just think she would be perfect for him. Sadly that did not happen and I understand why they didn\u2019t do it but they did give us 1 single episode all about if Tomoya got with her so that\u2019s good.******End. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10 \\n\r\nI\u2019d your still reading props to you I\u2019ll make this last category short. I f$&king loved this anime. There we go nice and short \\n\\n\r\nOverall-10 \\n\r\nAll in all this anime has some of the best characters in anime and some of the best drama in anime as well. I\u2019m sure even if your not into romance anime you\u2019ve heard of how sad clannad is and how no matter who you are you\u2019ll cry in your invested and it\u2019s all true. I highly recommend this anime to anyone looking for good romance. Be sure to watch clannad first though that\u2019s the most important thing to do because if you don\u2019t you won\u2019t be nearly as attached to he characters.\\n\\n\r\nPhew 2nd actual review down and boy was is a long one if you read all of it congrats to you I hoped I gave you good insight on this amazing anime and I hope you liked my opinions on certain things. I wanted to be more specific on things but during the time of me writing this review it is 3 in the morn and it\u2019s gotten really long so my other reviews will be much better.",

            "content": "What is it that ties us as humans together in this vast world?  Is it our own personal experiences that we share and intimately bring to our relationships?  Or is it perhaps some greater work that is unseen and not felt at all, uniting people in strange and inexplicable ways?  What happens when the thing worth fighting for suddenly vanishes, leaves, or disappears?  \r\nThese questions impose upon us the thought of our own existence - the why's and how's, the intricacies of the human relationship, even the purpose of our own simple existence.  In all the anime I have watched(you can check the list out, it's quite a bit), heck, even in all the TV shows, books, and movies, I have never come across a story that even attempts to touch these issues, let alone delve into them with such depth as to probe our very souls with thought provoking insights and revelations.  When I sat down to watch the first season, Clannad, I had very low expectations.  I'll admit, I was surprised to see a show that offered more than just a \"feel-good\" romance, more than some kind of fan-service harem genre.  What I got was a story that made me both laugh and cry and left me quite satisfied with the direction and telling of the entire series.  It was with this expectation that I immediately began to watch Clannad ~ After Story~ and submerse myself into the next chapter of the story.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the questions I presented earlier began to emerge in this iteration of the Clannad world.  I expected to witness a romantic-comedy; experience all the joys and frustrations that come along with intimate relationships.  And while the series begin with the same \"lighthearted\" and fun feel, a seriousness begins to come forth and take deep roots.  By the time I reached the 12th and 13th episode, I was confronted with an extremely complex and deeply emotional plot that began to tug at my heart and really affect me in ways I have never experienced.  I began to take short breaks after each episode and question my own life, examine things that have happened to me.  By the 16th episode, I began to cry and sob, near hysterically, at what was happening to the characters.  Too many experiences in my own life rang too true with what was going on.  It felt as if someone had decided to write a tale based upon my own life.  \\n\\n\r\nNow, before I frighten you off from watching this anime, I imagine this anime was so emotionally taxing on me because of my own personal experiences.  I'll let you know now that there's light at the end of the tunnel.  There's hope; a message of life, love and happiness that warms the heart and soul.  However, if you do plan on watching this, be prepared to cry... a lot.  \\n\\n\r\nThere's too much to be said about this series and to why I give it a perfect 10 in detail, so instead I offer a few words on each category.  \\n\r\n     The story is unlike any others I've seen or heard of.  If you thought the first was good, then this one makes the first one look like it was written by a bunch of kids.  There's such a depth and immensity to the story that it will likely take several times re-watching to fully appreciate and bring justice to this phenomenal plot.  \\n\r\n     As for the art, it is breathtakingly beautiful.  Everything looks like it was drawn or rendered with care and compassion.  No detail looks missed.  \\n\r\n     In terms of sound, that Dango song will grow on you and begin to become a favorite.  Other songs make their statement and touch and move appropriately to the scence.  Voice acting is top-notch as well.\\n\r\n     Characters can't even begin to be described.  Every single character is clearly and concisely presented, thoroughly developed and represented, and given plenty of attention to intricate details.  Rarely do characters ever feel this... real.  \\n\r\nAs for the enjoyment and overall areas... fantastic, amazing, wonderful... pick any positive adjective here - it fits.   \\n\\n\r\nAfter saying all that, I've finally found an anime to which I'm not afraid to give a perfect score - a new favorite that has changed my life, my personal views on many things, even my own outlook and expectations out of relationships I've had and still have.  Clannad ~After Story~ has earned it's right to be my new number 1.",

            "content": "For something which isn\u2019t really a comedy, Clannad is hilarious. A lot of the funniest situations are instigated by Okazaki, but he somehow manages to come off as manipulative without being mean-spirited. It adds another respectable element to his character and separates him even further from the hapless harem lead archetype. Not all the jokes work, although most do and had me laughing. Sunohara\u2019s jokes are often out of sheer stupidity,but are funny nevertheless.\r\nAn excellent sound track and a solid (although somewhat unpolished) visual effort combine to form a topnotch anime, while Ishihara Tatsuya\u2019s directing deserves credit for accomplished storytelling. The ending has been oddlyreceived with controversy, but I really don\u2019t understand why. Sure, there are still unanswered questions regarding the Illusionary World, but in my opinion, the importance of this pales in comparison to the issues that were tied up in the final episode. \\n\\n\r\nWhile there are a very few flaws in this anime, there are many aspects of it that have been executed extremely well.For example the constant and continual character development that the two leads go through makes up for it. Also the animation in itself was amazing rivaled only by few others. The story was one of a kind and can not be found in any other anime. As for the sound i give it a 9/10 only because i heard the angel beats sound track which i believe is the only 10/10. And the comedy and ever changing protagonists made for an enjoyable and exciting lead characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWe are given answers to questions that were left unanswered in season 1 such as: How will Nagisa's and Tomoya's relationship grown and change? and What the heck is up with the girl and the robot?. The shows shows us the next chapter in the lives of Okazaki Tomoya and Furukawa Nagisa  and then takes that and shoots off way beyond that, and takes through each moment , stage, and emotions of the lives of these two people who have decided to spend the rest of theirs lives together.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime achieves way more than other romances have. It isn\u2019t very often that we are given the chance to see the nature of growing up with all of its trials and errors.We are also shown just how hard maturity is to achieve, and as we observe Nagisa and Okasaki  struggle through some of life\u2019s toughest challenges or when we watch as one of them crumbles only to come out a stronger person even stronger shows that giving up is the easier option but bearing through will make you a better and stronger person.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10 Best and most touching story i have seen to date 12/23/11 ( Cried like a baby)\\n\\n\r\nSound:9/10 It is really well done and produced it goes well with the show except at times the ending is completely out of character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:9/10 Always evolving and becoming more mature.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9/10 top of line arguably the best as expected of Jun Maeda. Although the 2010 anime \" Angel beats\" also by Maeda has a slightly more polished look. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I enjoyed this anime very much, and i consider it to be one of the best I have seen and THE best romance anime. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys romance anime or anyone who would like to begin to start watching romance anime. This is the anime that brought me into the romance genre.I must say that this anime is a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nI can honestly say that I experienced something that changed my life and shaped me into a better person. To Jun Maeda the writer of this anime i praise and salute you.\\n\\n\r\nClannad showed me so much just to name a few.....\\n\\n\r\nIt showed me that when you work hard, you can achieve your goal.\\n\\n\r\nIt showed me how precious life is.\\n\\n\r\nIt showed me that things change, it's never standing still, but when you look out you can also find new funny things, so this is no reason to give up.\\n\\n\r\nIt showed me that good things? and sometimes also bad things happen, but when you look forward, you can go on.\\n\\n\r\nIt showed me how important family is\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlso if you don\u2019t cry/sob/anything involving tears during the show you ARE NOT HUMAN, just\\n\r\ndo yourself a favor an keep a box of kleenex nearby.\\n",

            "content": "Clannad: After Story - in partnership with the closest tissue manufacturer near you.\r\nWhy is Clannad After Story so highly rated? Why is it that anyone who watches this anime has to bring out the tissue box? There are certain feelings that regardless of age anyone will be able to understand. That feeling is the love from your mother and father. In any good parent, their love for their child is unconditional. \r\n\"Clann\" comes from Irish that closely translates to \"family.\" (Clannad is not a word as according to the results of my small internet scouring that I did) So, this anime is not necessarily focusedon the love between Nagisa and Tomoya but rather more of what happens when they become a family. What's powerful about this anime is that it doesn't only illustrate the meaning of family to be between husband and wife but also family in the sense of friends and the extended family. I think this is the highlight of this anime. Unlike other high school anime where they only deal with the romantic love between boy and girl, Clannad: After Story steps out of those walls and gives us a heartwarming and touching story about what it feels to be in a family. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of After Story gets docked some marks because of the first 12 episodes. They are really fillers. The episodes give some insight into the side characters but they hardly develop the relationship between our two MCs Nagisa and Tomoya. If they were to remove those episodes, I think it would have no effect on the feelings in the second part of the anime. In hindsight, however, those episodes do not impede the enjoyment of the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nBut after those filler arcs, After Story really takes off. The story doesn't take off in the sense that we are sent on a bullet train but rather we board the easy-going steam locomotive as it passes through your favourite scenic route. Of course, without a problem a story can't head anywhere. Nagisa and Tomoya encounter a pretty big problem and we see how they cope and get through it. While the anime doesn't show extremely intimate moments between Nagisa and Tomoya, we know their love is there by how they support each other through thick and thin, just like how a husband and wife should do for each other. When the Ushio arc comes around, imagine it starts raining heavily on your scenic trip. The outside is blurry, someone is crying in the cabin beside you, and dinner is not coming around anytime soon. Things get gloomy in this arc and I'm not going to lie. Without spoiling too much, after the anime ended, I felt I needed to fight ten gorillas to get my manliness back. But at the end of the show, the clouds disperse, the sun rises, the raindrops glimmer in the sunshine, and you had the best meal of your life. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike in Clannad where all the characters had some screen time, it's pretty lopsided in After Story. We do see some secondary character development but as soon as their arcs were finished, they faded out of the story. The main characters are Nagisa, Tomoya, Ushio, and Nagisa's parents, Sanae and Akio. If you have seen Clannad, the general character personalities are there. However, Nagisa takes the main spotlight and we see her become a very strong and caring woman while Tomoya puts most of his teenage years behind him and becomes a man with a lot of responsibilities. In contrast, Ushio is, in my opinion, one of the most touching characters ever put to the screen. It's pretty difficult not to like her. I want to talk a little bit more about Ushio so spoiler alert ahead! If you don't want to read it, skip down to the END SPOILER mark.\\n\\n\\n\r\n---SPOILER HERE!!---\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes me love Ushio so much is that she symbolizes the ultimate expression of the love between Tomoya and Nagisa. While we don't see any intimate moments between this couple, the writers provide us with Ushio as the representation of everything that Nagisa and Tomoya love about each other. Whenever she cries in her Daddy's arms, whenever she tells Tomoya \"I love you Daddy,\" you can't help but cry knowing that she does not have a mother to whom she can also say \"I love you Mommy.\" What also makes Ushio such a real character is that in reality, when a family welcomes a child to the world, that baby embodies the love between the mother and father, which is truly the most beautiful thing after the three words \"I love you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---END SPOILER---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very consistent with the first season and the artists didn't make many tweaks to the characters. Clannad and Clannad: After Story were my first anime where the characters had eyes that covered 2/3 of their face so it took me awhile adjusting to that but by After Story, I was comfortable with this unique character style. I enjoyed the nice and warm colours throughout the anime. The best animation probably was during the \"dream sequences\" where the robot had really crisp animation. In addition, I thought they captured the movements of Ushio very well. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is absolutely incredible. After the main characters that I listed earlier, the soundtrack is the final main character. Combined with the sequences in the show, the music will move you. Every time I listen to the OST, all the feels from the anime come rushing right back at me. It's a very endearing and beautiful soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely enjoyed Clannad: After Story. The feels and the messages that this anime sends you are absolutely outstanding. The potential flaw that may inhibit the enjoyment of the anime may be the ending. There are mixed opinions about it but I thought it nicely tied the first season with the second season. At first, I was confused but after thinking about it, I connected a few dots and it made much more sense. The ending also offers a lot of room for interpretation, which a great story should be able to do. \\n\\n\r\nClannad: After Story is one for the ages. After watching Clannad: After Story, I think I have a better understanding of the meaning of \"family.\" The anime made me feel really blessed to have a wonderful and caring mother and father. The themes and messages resonate with so many people. No wonder it is one of the most endearing anime of all time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Little Spoiler right here so you've been warned!\\n\\n\r\n---SPOILER ALERT!----\\n\\n\r\nMy favourite quote in the anime comes from Ushio when she was unable to find the toy robot, \"The first thing from Daddy,\" Tomoya bought for her:\\n\\n\r\n\"Daddy\u2026 You know\u2026 Sanae-san told me places I can cry are in the bathroom and in Daddy's arms.\" \\n\\n\r\nEven as I wrote that,  tears came streaming down my eyes.\\n\\n\\n\r\n---END SPOILER---",

            "content": "Clannad After Story, where do I began.\r\nStory - 10/10\r\nThe story is probably one of the strongest parts about this series, but it's hard to put into words without spoiling what made it so great. I believe that it is also hard to put into words is because of its simple plot. However, I think a story can be beautiful without being complex. The show's simple way of showcasing life is probably what led so many people to love this anime. Also, therapist not included with the DVD box set.\r\nArt - 9.5/10\r\nI think what drove most people away was the art style of the characters, specificallythe eyes. If you have already seen Key anime(Kanon 2006 and Air), then this shouldn't be a problem for you. However, for me, Clannad was the first Key anime I saw so I was kind of worried I wouldn't like it and it would take me out of the moment. But, to my surprise, It kinda grew on me. After finished Clannad, I was completely fine while watching After Story. Once you get used to the characters, the art and scenery behind them become beautiful, such as the shots of the town in the Opening. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAlright, here comes the big boys. The entire soundtrack was absolutely phenomenal. Every single track was memorable and completely drew me in. The opening theme had me humming the first half and sobbing the second. The ending theme was a little too happy go lucky but at least we had dango daikazoku in the first season. Even though the entire soundtrack was amazing, there were three tracks that were so good, I literally cannot name anything better. The first one is Nagisa's theme. Every time I hear the first three notes in any way shape or form, I can't help but think of her character and what she meant to the story. The second one is Snowfield. Now for all you After Story watchers, you may not believe it, but this song didn't only play in that one scene, and yes I mean THAT scene. However since the song was specifically tailored for the scene, It absolutely drew all of its watchers in. If I ever think of a song connected to being lost or loneliness, this is the first one I think of. It perfectly captured the feeling of being alone, and after watching it, will completely kill your heart every time you listen to Snowfield.\\n\r\nThe final one is The Palm of a Tiny Hand. The whole song is one big spoiler so I won't go into too much detail. Actually, all you need to know is that you will be crying the happiest of tears while this song plays.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I loved about the first season was that they had so many lovable characters that always had their time to shine. However, in After Story, it instead focuses on the relationship between Tomoya Okazaki and Nagisa Furukawa. Since the story is almost always focused on them, they get some of the best character development I've seen in any show. I think what made this show so sad was how lovable and how attached you would be to the characters by the time you reach After Story. There's also one very beautifully written character only in After Story and I think you will know who she is once you finish it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThere was just something so peaceful about seeing the main protagonists together. There was never any point in time where I didn't want to stop watching and that alone makes the enjoyment a 10 for me.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThere has never been any anime that has affected me like Clannad After Story. The sadness and beauty of the story, The different art style unlike most of the ones we see today, The most phenomenal soundtrack I have ever heard in my life, The down the earth and lovable characters, and the sheer enjoyment I felt while watching After Story will never truly be surpassed by anything for me. Thanks for reading my review, I hope you'll like it as much as I did.",

            "content": "Summary: Watch this one, it can appeal to just about anybody thought its comedy, romance, drama, character development, and plot.\r\nEvery once in a while, one watches a show that resonates with a them on a different level than most. For many, including myself, the Clannad series (and especially After Story) is one of them. The events of this series take you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions like few can, and does so in an extremely memorable fashion. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nLike most Slice of Life shows, the premise is very simple, and relatable for many. The trials and successes of each character are nothing out ofthe ordinary, but that realism is precisely what enthralls many viewers of the series. However, the supernatural aspect of the show adds another, more extravagant layer atop the gripping drama, and only makes the viewer want to keep watching even more. It can feel a bit slow, especially at the beginning of the season, but by about 1/4 of the way through, you'll be hooked if you're paying attention. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nEach episode is fluid, and extremely well done. Character movements are beautiful, character design is faithfully and skillfully adapted from the Visual Novel, and backgrounds are never stagnant. When they don't look good, they look great. It is clear that every aspect of the art was created meticulously, and with soul. Colors are bright and vivid, and are effectively used as symbolism throughout each episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nVoice acting is outstanding from every character, with no exceptions. As I said with the art, when it's not good, it's great. When it's not great, it's among the best anime has to offer (in my opinion, of course.) The other main strength of the show's sound is its OST, which is used brilliantly to compliment the scenes and their events. If a sad moment (and there are plenty) is happening on screen, the music pulls on your heartstrings even more. When something funny is happening, and music is necessary, it is lighthearted and a pleasure to listen to. And, importantly, when music is unnecessary in a scene, it doesn't have any. This all being said, the OP and ED fit the tone of the show well, but are not songs many would enjoy outside of watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nAs if Clannad: After Story didn't have enough strong points already, the character development is both greatly rewarding, and tragic. While each member of the supporting cast had fulfilling arcs in the first season, After Story focuses almost solely on Okazaki and the Furukawa family. By the end, however one may feel about it, it would be downright impossible to call Tomoya the same man he was at the beginning. Aside from witnessing his personal growth, a great deal is learned about each member of the Furukawa family, and each feels like their own complex character. The result is one of the most compelling and heart-wrenching, realistic, and even relatable dramas that anime has been able to offer thus far.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nHow much can you enjoy legitimately crying? Quite a bit, apparently. I thought I was done crying at anime after Plastic Memories and Your Lie in April, but this one did it. It broke down my emotional barrier, despite my trying to fortify it. It is tough to discuss the reasons without spoiling any plot points, so I won't. Long story short, the only reason I didn't give this section a 10/10 was because the beginning of the season felt rather uneventful compared to the rest, and the sadness really did depress me at times. However, I'd do it again without hesitation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nDespite my very few, small gripes I have with the show (the comedy, the beginning episodes, OP/ED), this is STILL among one of my top 10 favorite anime I've seen. Watch the first season in order to get the best experience, and then, be prepared to devote some time to binging this one. Be prepared to laugh, and maybe even cry. You might find this one to be among the most memorable that you watch!",

            "content": "Have you ever thought that fictional characters might influence your life so much that it changes your whole perspective on the purpose of life?\r\nI didn't, until I watched Clannad: After Story.\r\nGeneral information: \r\nIf you are familiar with anime, chances are high that you might have heard about Clannad and Clannad: After Story, two anime produced by Kyoto Animation and generally known as 'tearjerkers'. Both series are based on the Virtual Novel 'Clannad' that was originally produced by Key. So far I can also highly recommend the visual novel, but of course this review will describe the anime Clannad: After Story.\r\nTo put it simply, Clannad: AfterStory influenced my life in a way I would have never expected. I know that this sounds rather lame, perhaps also because you have certainly read this very line in a million other reviews, but it is a blatant truth that has to be mentioned. Which leads me to the point that it was obviously better than I expected (even though my expectations were unreasonably high after watching its predecessor (Clannad) and after hearing that After Story is going to be a million times better). Besides, After Story obviously changed my perspective on a lot of things. Even though the basic principle of the story is rather simple, it manages to grip you like almost nothing else, in particular because it has this very ability. Aside from that, the series gives you many different kinds of inspiration for your every day life. It is something that \u2013 simply said \u2013 changes your perspective on the world. Though, my conclusion will be explained further by the end of this review.\\n\\n\r\nPlot/Story: 9.8/10 \\n\\n\r\nAs I've said before, the plot of the story is nothing special by itself, it is something you can basically describe as slice of life. The story is neither extraordinary, nor outstanding by itself. Only in combination with the characters and all their (painful) background stories, you are able to appreciate the series at its best. This is also why I recommend everyone to watch Clannad before watching Clannad: After Story: only after watching the first season you are certainly able to comprehend the characters and to appreciate their character development. That's the big point: you get in the roles of the characters, and this is where After Story truly shines.\\n\r\nBasically, the first half of the series is indeed nothing special in comparison to other series. We have a couple of small arcs about some of the supporting characters, which aren't really outstanding, even though these episodes are pretty well-written and in general enjoyable. Still, those parts of the story definitely aren't enough to understand my rating, also because these arcs are absolutely irrelevant for the main story. The main characters don't get any significant character development during these arcs, therefore these arcs can be only seen as useful in terms of the minor characters and the development they get.\\n\r\nBut where After Story truly shines, is the latter half, the arcs of the story that are eventually relevant in terms of the main characters. Even though this part of the story 'just' describes all the ups and downs of the main character's life, it does it in a really astonishing way, and that's where the story shows its best side. Because of the well-proceeding character development (you can read more about that later), you can truly appreciate how the main character feels in all the phases of his life. Beside that, the whole set-up of the story was definitely great and the pace of the latter half was perfect, so the story never seemed rushed.\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, the plot doesn't seem extraordinary or complex, but this is another aspect why I consider this series as something great. You don't expect something from a series that has such a seemingly monotonous plot, yet the story is absolutely unique, particularly in combination with all the plot twists. Some people assume that the plot is predictable (mainly because of its genre), but I honestly don't think that. You'll be positively surprised when you watch it.\\n\r\nIf there is one thing that can be openly discussed by the community, it is obviously the ending. Some people like it, some people don't, mainly because it destroys some of the efforts the producers made in order to produce a realistic series (which can be seen as a little critique from my side). This is a question you have to answer for yourself, while it definitely depends on your personal preferences. On a positive note, there weren't any visible plot holes left after the final episode, even though the ending may seem a bit confusing if you don't know the Visual Novel.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Art style: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nThere are people who dislike Key's art style (in particular because of the big eyes of the female characters), but I actually grew to like it very much, also because it is really unique and since this style defines the characters in an appropriate way. Despite your personal preferences on this particular topic, it is generally known that KyoAni shows during After Story how truly beautiful an anime series can look. The animation is really well-made, in particular the scenes with Sakura trees are truly gorgeous, hence I can highly recommend the series to you if you like well-animated series. Beside those scenes, KyoAni's animation also shines in the 'Illusionary World' scenes. Those scenes are always animated in the ideal way to create a fitting atmosphere. In general the art style definitely fits the atmosphere of the series, also because of the appropriately used blurring effects. The art style was never misplaced throughout the whole series, even the backgrounds were usually memorable and breathtaking. In case you want to check it out for yourself, just watch the opening, since it manages to show perfectly how good the animation is.\\n\r\nAs well I see no reason to complain about the character designs. Each character is designed in an unique way, so you can identify them easily. In addition to that, their characteristics are well-represented by their designs, no matter whether the character is rather shy or extrovert. The characters' designs usually didn't spoil the story, though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nI guess that I should start this part of the review with my opinion about the opening theme. A truly gorgeous song. I started to listen to it on a daily basis, since it motivates me like almost nothing else. It is nearly perfection, in particular since this opening fits rather sad scenes as well as times in which an episode starts on a rather positive note.\\n\r\nOther songs that appear during AS are great as well. Just take 'Small Palms' as an example. This song is always able to fit the atmosphere, so I'd likely give the sound a high rating.\\n\r\nYou wonder why I didn't give the sound a 10/10? There is one simple reason.\\n\r\nTorch. (The ED)\\n\r\nAs much as I like Torch as a rather motivating song, it often managed to destroy the atmosphere of a complete episode in less than 10 seconds. Including various ED's would have been better, considering that the upbeating atmosphere of Torch doesn't fit a couple of episodes at all. Still, I also grew to like this song.\\n\r\nKudos to Jun Maeda for this one, he did a great job again.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the character voices (attention: I only watched the English sub, which means that I only heard the Japanese voice actors and actresses): Each character definitely got the perfect voice actor/actress in the 'original' version. The character voices perfectly fit their characteristics, the quality of the sound is consistently good as well. Beside that, the voices are perfectly detachable, so you will never get confused by them. The voice actors definitely made a good job here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nI already enjoyed the characters (and the relationships between them) during Clannad, but After Story made me truly love them like my own children. \\n\r\nTo start with, all the characters were really well-rounded. Each character has got many different flaws, but also many strengths, which were mainly connected to the painful background stories of them (you can read more about them later). Not a single character has been out-of-place, hence I grew to like them all.\\n\r\nBeside this aspect, the producers managed to keep all the characters realistic throughout the whole series. Not a single character has behaved in an inhuman way during the series. Their reactions were always comprehensible, in particular the actions and thoughts of the main character (Tomoya Okazaki) were always so realistic that it sometimes hurt a little inside my heart.\\n\r\nThough, one of the most important points is definitely the fact that you will certainly relate to the characters in a lot of different ways. You can easily identify with the characters in a variety of occasions, which makes you feel even stronger for the characters. This can be considered as one of the big advantages of Clannad. All the joy and the pain the characters feel, will be also certainly felt by you. Which leads me to another enormous advantage of After Story: the ingenious character development. \\n\r\nThroughout the whole series we are able to see how the characters grow because of all the hardships they experience. It is truly unique to see such a well character development through the whole series. In particular the main character, Tomoya, visibly grows because of all the hardships in his life. There will also appear another certain character halfway through the series, who will likely change your personal view on your own life.\\n\r\nThough, not only the main characters have got a good character development, but also the supporting ones. I honestly didn't expect to see a series with such a great character development, even for the supporting characters. None of them were flat or unnecessary; everybody has got the ideal place in the story as a whole, so the amount of supporting characters also can't be considered as too high.\\n\r\nTake Youhei Sunohara as the best example. He is already well-known from the first series, during which I honestly disliked him. But, given all the development he has got during After Story, I also grew to love him as a character. We can perfectly see how even such a 'sidekick' can get a good development and grow to a loyal, sharp-minded human.\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, I'll remember all the characters (even the supporting ones) of Clannad even in the distant future. Their sad, painful background stories in combination with all the hardships they experienced were enough to make me remember them for a long time. Each character is really unique, but also perfectly outlined.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Influence on my life: 11/10\\n\\n\r\nBefore I start to talk about other aspects, I would also like to emphasize all the humorous elements of the story, obviously since they are one of the aspects because of which I really enjoyed After Story. Despite being overly emotional and something you can call a 'tearjerker', the series also managed to make me laugh uncontrollably a couple of times. Even though the first season had a couple more running gags, several moments of After Story were hilarious as well. (SPOILER) Just take 'Drunk Nagisa' as an example. To see how such a lovely character gets drunk is something totally hilarious and unexpected. To such moments I'd also count the moment Nagisa tells her father something about her private life with Tomoya, or in general almost each interaction between Tomoya and Akio. Hell, these two are so similar that my sides almost broke a couple of times. (/SPOILER) All the humorous elements were a the perfect compensation to all the emotional moments. \\n\r\nOkay, but now back to the main topic...\\n\r\nClannad: After Story is definitely one of the view anime I can recommend to everyone. Even non-anime fans will certainly be touched by it, which can be great if you intend to watch such a series. Besides, you needn't know anything about anime if you want to understand it; you can just watch it and be entertained.\\n\r\nAside from that, I would re-watch it definitely as soon as possible. The series also contains a couple of hidden teases (which make every single re-watch a great experience), but I'd rather re-watch it because of all the lessons it taught me. The whole season is almost perfect as a whole, so I would definitely re-watch only both series as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nNow about my rating... Some of you may be irritated by my rating, but I'm fully serious here. This may sound stupid, but AS definitely changed my life in such a positive way that I can only give it such a high rating. Because of it I now tend to pay more attention to the point of view other people have, in fact, I started to think more about other people and their opinions at all. \\n\r\nSadly, the improvement it made on me can be hardly put into words, but I'll try to do it. Basically, the way After Story portrayed what a human being can withstand (and what it obviously can't), showed a whole new side of life to me. While the story seems rather simple, it made a huge influence on my life by directly showing to me what can go right, what can go wrong, and how everything influences our mind and our life as a whole. After all, After Story shows a whole new side of life to its viewers: a dark side that everyone tries to ignore. While a couple of other series try to ignore this rather dark side of life, After Story directly puts a finger on it, showing what really matters in life: family, friendships and ultimately love, no matter whether to your family or to your precious friend. It gives you a lot of inspirations for your life, no matter how you used to live before watching it. And because of the huge impact the series makes on you, you will certainly remember it even in the far future. Blatantly said, it certainly makes you a better person.\\n\r\nThough, there is another important point that makes the series so memorable. While the story itself is already memorable (also because of its simplicity), the characters play an important role as well. No matter whether it's Nagisa's shyness in combination with her ability to remain always positive for all the people she loves, Tomoya's (almost) incomprehensible ability to keep on living after everything or Ushio's innocence that ultimately portrays the view of a little child on the difficulties of life in a perfect way: Clannad: After Story is a memorable series that lives not only by the story, but also of the realistic way the characters deal with the struggles in their life.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Rating: 10/10\\n\r\nIn a nutshell, After Story is something you can describe \u2013 blatantly said \u2013 as life. It shows you all the ups and downs of a life, which isn't extraordinary, but it does that in such an astonishing way that you may be blown away, just as I am. All the emotions that were both shown and felt from the characters (and from the viewer) throughout the whole series, such as anger, envy, grief and depression, but also faith, fortitude, charity and \u2013 most of all \u2013 hope, make the series perfect as it is. All the emotions are portrayed in such a realistic way that they sometimes even become real, the viewer can really feel all the pain the characters have inside them. And that's why I consider After Story as a true masterpiece. Thus, just by showing you all the difficulties and hardships one can experience in his own life, it can certainly change your view on what life is about. This series definitely gives you a lot to think about.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, there is also another important aspect why I highly recommend Clannad: After Story to everyone. Whenever I think about a life decision, I started to remember what the characters of After Story experienced. Unlike many other series, Clannad: After Story isn't something you'll easily forget the day after you finish it. It is something that will certainly burn itself deeply into your mind, not because of the tears you may shed, but rather because it shows life from a different angle. Remember what you would have done in Yukine's place, after everything that she has experienced in her life. Or think about all the hardships Tomoya went through. This series is extremely unique because of its ability to show you how the human mind certainly reacts to life-changing events and everything that follows them. Besides, the series shows you what can go right in your life, and what certainly can't go always right. Whenever you'll think about them while making an important decision, you'll likely pay more attention on the view of other people (just as I do), and that's why Clannad: After Story made such a huge impact on my life and why I can highly recommend it to you.\\n\\n\r\nDango Daikazoku!",

            "content": "Main focus of this review is to explain someone new to this why this anime is so high rated and why it takes top positions in all ratings. I also cover whole Clannad - both seasons. Also, I want to say this review is somewhat serious. It is not made just to troll or offend someone. Plus, as soon as 80% of reviews give this anime \"10/10\" and are written in a very emotional manner, it shouldn't really hurt to have an opinion like that once in a while.\r\nClannad is a two season slice of life anime with a high payload of drama. Though it'ssomewhat wrong, I like to think of it as a biographic story as it follows a large lifespan of it's protagonist. Main focus is a love story here. Now, I like these, so I was quite delighted to see this.\\n\\n\r\nFirst season tells us about his high school life, covering his relationship with his school friends. It is split mostly into \"arcs\", focusing on some characters' problems and how protagonist and others help to solve them. The second one goes to what happened after, covering main character's adulthood. It tells just a few separate arcs just the way the first one did when it begins, and then goes for one solid story. This is  all good, but what isn't is that I don't really know what more is to say.\\n\\n\r\nAfter 3 or 4 episodes of this I noted that something was wrong. I shaked it off and continued. To drop so fast is unforgivable. But the problems just went on. All this time up to the very end, there was no story. Characters were mostly going to school, chating, eating, walking, carving out wooden stars, remembering stuff and etc. I know already that such is the definition of slice of life, yet that sclice of life revolves around a story. Should that be a love story or any other one, there is a pivot around which the story does revolve. Even if it's arc separated, it usually gives a new one to follow, which is good.\\n\\n\r\nThere were some attemps of plot to start going on, which was making me excited after all this time of wait. And this is when another bad point of Clannad happened. Main method of self-development of this anime is forced drama. The word \"forced\" fits perfectly. Drama here doesn't really highlight anything or uses itself to give an emotional development. It is given at completely unexpected points in amounts incomprehensible, and given without a clear reason to. Sometimes it's like it  flows out of your screen and you sink in it.\\n\\n\r\nBy the point of no return, you notice you get to just watch a life of a person. I mean, not a fantastic story of some usual schoolboy given superpower, not a \"tear jerking\" love story, not anything like anything, it's just merely a life of a person. Would you like to just watch how some person you know lives and spends his time? It's like watching a void. And this void keeps stretching itself. It feels like it's main point is to show you as much nothing as it possibly can. Of course, one can say that some characters are shown to have clearly fantastic and unusual lives, but the way you're shown them are through a prism of forced dramma. Thus, instead of being \"heart warming\", they just annoy. Even the music here is stretching itself. It usually is a single piece instrumental composition, that isn't really directed or cut to fit the scenes, it just plays on repeat for the whole episode. Like even music is binded to suffer in world of Clannad.\\n\\n\r\nShould be left noted that there is actually a comedy aspect going on here. I don't really know how to call this genre so I will go with \"Reaction comedy\". So, if you're not familiar with how a comedy based on reactions is developed, here is a quick look. So, imagine some person you know and talk to some times. And now let's try to make a \"Reaction comedy\" out of this. Imagine how you just come to this person and out of the blue tell that person that you're pregnant. But instead of asking you if you're retarded, this someone immediately does a tripple backflip (in a very bad animation) and lands on his head (with a funny sound). And then you both go and carve out the wooden stars. By thr way, wooden stars. Second 50% of \"funny\" stuff is scenes that are supposed to be funny repeating themselves through the whole anime. This is Clannad humor for you. Might be ok for kids, didn't work for me.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, I already heard stories of how shockingly and unexpectedly Clannad ends. This refers the second season, but I was waiting for something from the end of the first one. It ended like it has begun, from nothing to nothing. Well, ok, second season sounds like fun, is it not? It is not.\\n\\n\r\nSecond season, like I said, starts right after the first one and... It's arcs of forced drama all over again. Those I described already, let's go for the cherry on the cake. Right after first 1/3 of the episodes end, one large arc of main character starts to go on. Next 2 paragraphs may contain very minor spoilers, skip them to the end if you're afraid of these.\\n\\n\r\nThis is when a love story starts to happen. The problem with this one though is how it is developed. It is developed in exactly the same way everything else in this anime is developed. If we go for the trivia, love story in anime is usually made to give it's viewer strong feelings and sensations through scenes. Those are mostly scenes of the first kiss or how someone tells someone how he loves that someone in very moe way. In Clannad AS, those things are avoided and are not shown at all. Tomoya and his girlfriend (guess who he will chose) are just talking to each other sometimes and the next episode someone says that they date. Tomoya's girlfriend says she wants them to marry and the next episode they are already married. \"I want a little one from Tomoya-kun!\" and the next episode she's pregnant. And then they go and carve out wooden stars.\\n\\n\r\nFor the whole \"SHOCKING\" ending thing, that is not really shocking and that viewer might have already guessed out, is that just by some magic thingy all problems get solved and everything is ok once over again. End of spoilers and end of story.\\n\\n\r\nBut there are actually good things. I was giving this anime last chances untill the very end of it, and there actually are good things to remember. There were some minor scenes in the second season that I seriously enjoyed. And the main good thing about the whole anime is that Nagisa's dad is a wonderful man and each time he was shown it was becoming interesting to watch again. I should say that the way that drawing was made was good. But it only went for lightning of decorations and backgrounds, and only for a short span of a first season, even this KEY managed to lose. And the drawing of characters is still disturbing.\\n\\n\r\nLet's go for conclusions. There is not much to say about the last arc, i'm not going to judge it any further. You might want to watch it and do it by yourself. Yet this anime as a whole is a large big nothing. The main reason is how even though it seems to cover some really old and hard topics like \"What is a Family\" and \"What makes a Man\" and \"What is a wooden star\", it doesn't really give any answers to these and doesn't really get you to any sort of logical conclusion. And conclusion is vital for something biographic. Even \"Forest Gump\" has one and provokes some themes. Clannad does not.\\n\\n\r\nSome might say that this anime is special because how fantastic and unusuall Tomoya's life was. I say that each and every usual school boy's in anime life is fantastic and unusual. And not even in anime, all of our lives are in some way fantastic and unusual. But this one is not shown in the way it might get interesting.\\n\\n\r\nI also heard of, but didn't really get to encounter a special kind of snowflakes that were saying that Clannad is an anime for \"elite\" people for a reason that it has no fanservice at all. And this is also wrong. In some way. This depends on what you actually bellieve fanservice to be. Yes, there are no pantsushots. Many casual animes have no pantsushots. \"Attack on Titan\" does not have any. Did anyone ever said he is special and elite because he likes \"Attack on Titan\"? I think this anime actually has a relatively large amount of fanservice - I do remember some times point of view just zooms in on some of the girl's chest or ass. There also is bathing scene in the special episode.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're 14 years old and younger, you didn't really watch much anime to compare with to this point, or you're just easy to get to with lots of out of place drama, you might actually like this. It might actually fit you. In any other case, it probably won't, so don't bother. There are anime of the same genre that might be \"better\" for you to watch.",

            "content": "Never have I seen a anime affect me in such a raw emotional way. I don't normally write reviews but after watching this series I just had no choice. I thoroughly enjoyed the first season of Clannad, it's implementation of supernatural elements was a bit confused and it suffered structural issues from being based on a visual novel but overall it was a joy to me. Tomoya as a character works really well in my mind, he has angst that is incredibly easy to get behind and established very early on. He's the perfect mix of cynical and caring that I find intensely relatable. Nowfor our other lead Nagisa... wow Nagisa is just wonderful. She has enough quirky charm to be adored by just about anyone. So I come out of this first season loving the two leads and sense of fun/humour that the show exuded only to then come in contact with the first 8 episodes of After Story. 8 episodes that put Tomoya and Nagisas relationship on hold while exploring incredibly forced drama that was borderline embarassing and hard to watch. I was so ready to pass off this season. Then episode 9 came along brining Tomoya and Nagisa back to the forefront only to be followed by episode after episode tackling incredibly human issues involving adultlife/family from struggling financially to trying to make time for your loved ones. I had never seen a anime tackle such mature subject matter in as delicate, real and engaging a way as this. Throw in some unbelievably tender, sweet and lovable moments between our two leads and you have me in love with this franchise all over again. Before I knew it this show was contantly on my mind, I just had to know where these characters were headed next. Little did I know that the show would soon rip out my heart in what is possibly the most crushing scene in any medium ever. I cried hard and I mean hard, I even found myself thinking about the scene and getting a little teary eyed days after seeing it. It was incredibly embarassing to see how much this series had grabbed hold of me. The following arc exploring loss had me feeling so much empathy for our lead in a immersive way that not many shows have been able to achieve. You literally feel every emotion in these last few episodes, wether that be joy or crippling sadness. Then that beautiful ending comes and reaffirms all the shows themes about family and relationships in a way that only Kyoto- Ani could. This is a show that made me laugh, cry and feel every emotion that it wanted to convey. Sure it has structural issues and it's supernatural elements are convuluted/confused but dammit you'll be hard pressed to find a show as beautifully tender, raw and sad in it's explorations of human relationships. Pulling a story like this off well is a feat in any medium, let alone anime.  This show is flawed yes, but it's also achingly beautiful and hands down my favourite anime of all time. A Stunning piece of work indeed.",

Sure there's a bit of sadness but then it all goes back to a clean slate. What got me most though was the terrible idea of what seems like a dream world that vaguely related back to the actual story which made no sense whatsoever and then once that was over with, thelast 3 episodes were just a waste of time all together.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was actually okay and made this show almost watchable.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy this at all.

            "content": "As you may have gathered from the title \u2018Clannad after Story\u2019 is the sequel of the anime \u2018Clannad\u2019 and a very good sequel at that! I might even go as far as to say that it simply outshines its predecessor presenting us viewers with a beautiful story of that difficult transition from adolescence into adulthood. And indeed, the cast we\u2019ve all come to know and love face some horribly adult situations throughout the duration of After Story but they overcome these obstacles slowly but surely, beginning to mature all the while. \r\nClannad after Story begins where its prequel left off. Tomoya and Nagisa are verymuch in love, Aw...\\n\r\nBut hold it, there\u2019s more! Unlike with many other anime of its genre After Story pretty much revolves around the couple\u2019s relationship and how it develops over t-i-m-e. Likewise with Clannad, the beginning of After Story is divided into multiple arcs, or stories revolving around the people touching in on each other\u2019s lives. By about episode ten however the focus shifts back onto Tomoya and Nagisa and the development of their relationship. It is this shift that may cause viewers to become unsettled or to lose interest as the traditional Clannad style slowly begins to morph into something a bit newer. \\n\r\nInstead of focusing on those around them the anime chooses to shift its focus onto the two main characters, Tomoya and Nagisa themselves. I think that this is only natural as life itself is something that is constantly shifting and changing. People make and lose friends all of the time and as you get older and more mature your life begins to centre on one or two of those more important people in your life and those around you gradually fade away as they begin their own lives. It is Clannad after Story\u2019s accurate portrayal of life in all of its bitter entirety that makes it shine and why I\u2019d implore those unsettled by the change to persist.\\n\\n\r\nClannad after Story features both new and familiar faces. Their roles might be considered more minor this time round but the supporting cast of Clannad are still as lovable and enthralling as ever. Forever adding humour where humour is needed and wisdom where wisdom is required, the supporting cast does what it says on the label. They\u2019re the gooey, jammy stuff that holds this metaphorical \u2018cake\u2019 of an anime together and without them; it\u2019d taste pretty darn bland. \\n\r\nIt is during After Story that Nagisa\u2019s true maturity, beauty and silent determination as a blossoming woman shine through. She becomes so much more than just your average school girl featuring in your run-of-the-mill shoujo anime. She\u2019s truly an extraordinary character. Her bravery and sheer determination to overcome all obstacles despite all odds moved me to tears. Her bravery made me feel [i]ashamed[/i] for taking my own life for granted, I learnt that I should treasure every moment, every breathe as being something precious. Could you say the same for many other anime women out there? Think about that one for a moment...\\n\r\nTomoya, bless his soul, is the character to go through the most development throughout the duration of After Story. Life throws everything it has in his way, every time he thinks he\u2019s found at least a little bit of happiness another obstacle rears its ugly head but he does his best to work through them. He struggles and at some points in the story loses all hope whatsoever that his life will ever get better but it\u2019s those around him that give him a reason to live and that too applies in real life for what would any of us be without those around us to support us. With the help of those around him Tomoya works through his troubles and comes out of the other side a stronger man.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Story\u2019s art follows through and continues at that same high standard set by its prequel. The background art is beautiful drawn and coloured with exceptional detail. The character design is characteristically cute for an anime of its genre, each and every one of the girls sporting a pair of very shiny and very large beautiful eyes. The only flaw I\u2019d give the character design is that the characters never seem to age. I don\u2019t know how young Akio and Sanae were when they gave birth to Nagisa but even after two time-skips they look not a day older than twenty. And I\u2019d certainly expect Tomoya to look slightly more \u2018raggedy\u2019 after that second time skip! The show focuses on how the characters mature and develop, it\u2019d be nice if we could see them age (even just a little!) too!\\n\\n\r\nThe only significant changes to the score of Clannad after Story are the brand spanking new OP and ED themes. Whilst the OP theme is fantastic, Lia\u2019s voice being at its most beautiful and soulful, the ED theme was a huge letdown, especially after following on from the magic that was Dango Daikazoku. The upbeat and light-hearted song just didn\u2019t seem right following on from some of the most heart-breaking episodes in my own personal anime history which is a shame because I\u2019m sure that applied to a more \u2018cheerful\u2019 anime/situation the song could\u2019ve been quite popular. As per usual the soft piano pieces throughout the show play a key part in triggering the viewer\u2019s emotions. But the theme that really captured my heart is called \u2018Farewell at the foot of the hill\u2019. It\u2019s the most emotionally charged piece of music I\u2019ve ever had the delight to hear and even now I tear up whenever I hear those first few soft, subtle piano notes. As we listen to the familiar theme the impact it has on the viewer begins to grow as the violins begin to accompany the ever so gentle piano melody. The piece gathers strength as more and more percussion instruments infiltrate the piano/harpsichord melody, working together to create a beautiful story, the story of the couple\u2019s lives so far, all the fear and pain they\u2019ve had to overcome just to reach this moment in time, together. As the theme slowly dies away you\u2019re left with this horrible empty feeling which, sad as it might be reflects just some of the pain the characters are going through at the moment. It\u2019s truly an astounding piece of music I\u2019d recommend you listen to even if you don\u2019t watch the anime. \\n\\n\r\nClannad after Story teaches us some powerful lessons. It teaches us to treasure each and every passing moment and those that we love because life, like happiness, is a fleeting thing. As well as reminding the viewer how valuable their life is After Story teaches and reminds them of the power of hope and miracles. Giving up is just so easy to do when life deals unto your doorstep more trials and tribulations, what\u2019s harder is having the will to continue and persevere until you come to a place where you feel all is right once more, After Story reminds us all of all of this in the most heart-breaking ways possible. For dealing with such a heavy and complex \u2018philosophy\u2019 as successfully as it has I\u2019ve given After Story 9/10. Kudos! \\n",

            "content": "Wow... Just. Wow.\r\nI never thought that an anime would make me feel sad and depressed, but at the same time happy. Nevertheless, only few things made me cry across any medium, but this did. After Story has a great depth that is incomparable to any other; relatable characters, amazing story, great ending, beautiful animation and the music - where these aspects fit into place.\r\nStory -10/10\r\nTo say the story is good is an understatement. It is very well written and thought of. When you rewatch Clannad (1st season) especially the part of the Illusory world or even the OP - you would be mindblown. Everything aboutthe first series foreshadows really what happens in After Story. It is unlike other animes that just follows whatever happens with them - main character(s) goes into a different place or meets a different person and the story of an episode or arc begins. Although I do love some of these animes, because also with that form of plot it could still be beautiful written -  in Clannad After Story,  the plot knows exactly where it is going, and without the expense of spoiling the viewer. It does so with a momentum that is slow at first and then all at once comes full circle - this is most apparent in the last episodes. That is what made it genius. Some could argue that the first eight episodes were bad. In my case, I don't think so. Although they do pale in comparison to the rest of the series, watching them could make you more invested in the secondary characters, and a little bit to Tomoya and Nagisa as well - which was the formula of Clannad, which is really not that bad. Once episode 9 starts however, everything just transcends into a masterpiece of story telling. Episode 16 and 18 were my favorite parts and also the ending too. About the ending, I noticed that a lot of people are quite negative about it. I do respect them for that, I even personally believe that it could have been better in some aspect. However, as I re watched the series, I realized that the ending truly was very well thought of, and for that I could say that it ended near-perfectly (IMHO of course).\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nWhat more can I say about Kyoto Ani's works, except that they are all beautiful? The locations and the way each character's face changes, as well as the minute details in each scene - everything is done is such a way that is very, very pleasing to the eye. What's more, they really made their animation very, very good especially in the scenes of the Illusory World, combining what I think is CGI with hand drawn images which is truly majestic.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\r\nThe EP and the OP are just memorable really. I even memorized a little bit of the OP! What I do like best however is the score. It made everything else really emotional and really memorable. Especially those used in episodes 16, 18, 21 (I don't want to spoil so I am not citing scenes haha), those were just critical to the scenes themselves and those episodes may not have been my favorite should score have not accompanied the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\r\nThis is the best aspect of Clannad. Personally, I think Nagisa is very relatable to myself; and Tomoya even. I am a very introverted person and her failures during episodes 9-15 affected me greatly. Although I am guy, I could relate why she is the way she is became I am very similar to her. There is also however a great depth to the character of Tomoya. He changed greatly, and I could say that he became one of my favorite anime characters of all time. More or less, this season could also be viewed as a character study on Tomoya. What does it take for a boy to become a man? What are the things that you would have to acquire when you would eventually grow up? Other characters are not really present in most episodes, but I do like Yoshino's arc and eventually Ushio's (not to mention Sanae's and Akkio's). Though they appear only in a few episodes or are not really the focus, they are already multi-faceted which is spectacular in itself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nI became depressed and sad, but I am happy also after watching this series. Is that weird? I guess not. When you get to watch a show that is so very touching and very life-changing, what else is there to left to feel? I guess, I was warned by my friends that this anime would make you sad, and it did. It did so at a great magnitude. But to experience this sadness, is also a different way to view life. After watching, I contemplated what truly is important in my life. I guess Clannad After Story answered - with family and love. Truly I was affected, because as of the moment I was not really into these aspects of my life. It made me re-evaluate my decisions. To cut it short - it greatly influenced me as a human being.\\n\\n\r\nClannad After Story is life changing to me. It affected me greatly and it did so at a large magnitude that I believe I could never, ever forget. It is beautiful and I am glad that I did watched it. I hope you will too.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Tomoya, Nagisa isn\u2019t just our daughter, she\u2019s our hope. So I want you to know that today on you\u2019re part of that hope, too. So never forget that your happiness is our happiness as well. In other words, try your best to be happy, okay?\"\r\nI had watched Clannad for the first time, I was quickly drawn in. The progression through the heriones' arcs were done expertly and I had felt like it was my favorite series ever. Thene I stumbled across After Story.\r\n(ATTENTION I am basing this rating off of genre, but I will also rate it traditionally at the end. Also be free tomessage me on how I grade using genres)\\n\\n\r\nAfter I had finished the first season, I couldn't wait to start watching After Story, due to the fact that I thought Clannad's After Story could in no way match how amazing Clannad was. I couldn't have been more wrong.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Story is a direct continuization of it's predecessor, Clannad. I must admit, the first few episodes seemed like a failed comedy relief scenario, pretty much throughout the Sunohara arc. Things get a little more interesting through Yukine's arc, and Misae's arc is actually quite strange, but nevertheless has a good impression that is left. After all these arcs are done with is where After Story really shows it's true colors.The main arc is full of happiness, surprise, sadness, anger, sorrow, hoplessness, love, and the fact that life goes on, no matter what. In fear of any spoilers, I will get right into Genre Rating:\\n\\n\r\nDrama - 50 out of 50\\n\r\nWhat really makes After Story shine is it's ability to lead you on with happiness and love, only to stab you with harsh-reality and sorrow. Out of all the animes i've watched, only After Story has managed to evoke me enough to cry. Twice. Even if I re-watch it and know what is ahead, I still breakdown into tears. After Story really does have a great way of telling a story to where it is almost perfect, then burning it down with a tragedy.\\n\\n\r\nRomance - 25 out of 25\\n\r\nThe main story arc around After Story is Tomoya's and Nagisa's strong love for each other. Even when times are rough, especially for Tomoya, Nagisa helps him pull through, doing whatever she can to help. What really astounds me is how much they progress together, conforming to one another, to the point where they aren't an awkward couple like the end of Clannad, but in a comitted loving relationship in After Story. It is really touching\\n\\n\r\nSlice of Life - 25 out of 25\\n\r\nSlice of life in some animes are usually just some guys life revolving about school, which was what the original Clannad was about. Now, don't get me wrong, I love scenarios like that, but After Story was different. It was a story of a man, working to keep his apartment, to make money for his loving wife, and to carry on as life usually does. It seems so simple, where it's is so very far from it. There are so many things going on during this process, one might wonder how he even decides to go to his job. And after he loses everything he cares for, he still continues to work, because that's life. \"Life goes on\" is the most painstakingly-true theme of this series, and it hit me very hard\\n\\n\r\nFinal score: 100 out of 100\\n\r\nNeed I say more? Everything I've said is the most I can say without revealing any spoilers, so go ahead and watch it, but make sure you watch the original Clannad first, you won't regret it.\\n\\n\r\nI am also a big believer in the final episode. The original series had fantasy and supernatural as two of it's genres, so I was hoping for something like that to come along. And besides, if that last episode didn't exist, I would have constant anxiety over what i've seen, so i'm glad it's there.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as promised\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10/10\\n\r\nI really can't say much more. Please, please go watch this anime. You won't regret it.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nYet again Key and Kyoto Animation make another beautifully drawn and flowing anime. Layered effects, colors that fit the mood, and wonderfully drawn characters, After Story will not dissapoint.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10+/10\\n\r\nI am a music person. That is my life. And after hearing After Story's OP, I already knew this was the best intro to any anime ever. Though true the ED really smacks you in the face after experiencing emotional distress while watching After Story, it is overpowered by the amazing back tracks to it's characters and it's OP. The voice acting is incredible! They seem to mature so much to the point where if you watch Clannad again after watching After Story, you'll be confused. Trust me, watch the English Dub, it is perfect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10+/10\\n\r\nThe character progression in the series is spectacular, especially around the middle, where you see some dynamic changes in everyone. Watching Clannad is the best way to see the major change of personalities. Showing how people can change for there loved ones is very realistic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10+/10\\n\r\nNot one anime will ever be as marvelous and well put together as this one is. I would ask no more from the series, because it stops at the perfect spot. The show is also a steady emotional climax that is waiting to occur. There could be just one, or many. It all depends on you, and I loved that aspect a lot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\r\nAny less should be a crime. After Story really showed my how harsh life is and not to take anything for granted. Stay true to your family, where it can be your true family and/or your friends, and you'll be just okay. Life is not a dream, you cannot awake from reality, so lead on with your life in the pursuit of happiness.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my extensive review. It's greatly appreciated. Please go watch After Story. There's nothing to regret, I promise.\\n\\n\r\n\"Do you like this school? I really, really love it. But nothing can stay unchanged. Fun things... Happy things... They can't all possibly stay unchanged. Even so, can you keep on loving this place?\"",

            "content": "I didn't write a review for this after watching it because I honestly believe my words won't do it justice, but I'll give it a try anyway. I'm pretty new to reviews so please bear with me.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nI would definitely give this a 10, but judging the anime's entirety, I'm gonna have to give it a 9 since the first 10 episodes or so are a repetitive...as in they're really similar to Clannad and not that special. What really separates After Story from the first one is what happens after the first 10 episodes, where the plot twists and character development really take off. Ihave never ever cried from reading a book, watching a movie, listening to a song etc. until the day I watched After Story. I have never experienced a story so sad and moving. \\n\\n\r\nMyanimelist describes a 10 as a masterpiece. What defines a masterpiece then? To me, an anime is a masterpiece if it accomplishes what its genre intended. That means if it's a comedy, I think it's a comedic masterpiece if it made me laugh like never before. If it's an action masterpiece, that means I felt the intensity and nervousness as if I was there with the MCs. \\n\\n\r\nAF is a slice of life and drama masterpiece. Upon completing it, I felt my life had changed; I had always had an awful relationship with my parents, but AF taught me the value of family and friends and just how precious your loved ones can be. It actually changed my ideals and beliefs. I'm not saying I magically started loving my parents again, but AF taught me I should at least appreciate them. I didn't think anime even had the power to do something like that to me, but AF did.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who's seen Air or Kanon will know that Key always does a great job with their art, whether it's animating scenery or characters. Yea, Key does use a distinct style with animating their characters, but I didn't see any problems with it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nYes, the story itself for AF was unbelievable, but really the music itself was absolutely critical to it becoming a masterpiece. The music Key chose for its scenes fit perfectly and really were what moved me to tears during the sad moments. Even after watching the anime, I immediately downloaded AF's soundtrack because it was just that good. In fact, I mention in my Kanon review that what prevented that anime from becoming a masterpiece was because the music they chose was kind of poor and awkward. But AF's music was sad when it needed to be, and funny when it needed to be. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI was slightly disappointed that most of our heroines from the first Clannad disappear in AF, but the character development of our main hero and heroine becomes all the more outstanding because of it, since there's now more room to concentrate on just their relationship. \\n\\n\r\nTomoya continues his journey from a bad boy who cares about nothing into a respectable man who learns the true meaning of family while Nagisa finally sheds her shell of shyness and learns to support her man ins his journey. They both encounter terrible hardships, but they learn to grow from them and they both remind us that people can indeed change for the better, and that good deeds are always rewarded, no matter how small. Sounds a bit overly optimistic? Perhaps, but every once in a while we need an overly optimistic message to remind us that while life is hard, it has its rewarding moments.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nTruly a moving and impacting story. I cried a ton during this anime (I have honestly never cried from anything I've read, seen, or heard before until this show) and you definitely will too. I can't even bring myself to rewatch this anime because of how emotional it is. If you love drama, slice of life, or romance, this anime will catapult itself to the top of your list once you're done with it. I know I'm making this anime sound really serious, but just like in the first Clannad, its funny moments are indeed funny and you will have a good time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI think I already said all I've wanted to say, and the final conclusion is: you will love this anime. However, definitely keep a box of tissues next to you while you watch. I'm not even kidding. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Clannad is an anime in my opinion that you'll either really like, or really dislike. I was one of those people that really liked this anime. Clannad has always been one of my favorite animes, so I've finally decided to write my review on Clannad: After Story. Brace yourselves, I like to write really in depth reviews on stuff like this..\r\nStory- 9/10\r\nClannad: After Story has one of the most thought out stories in an anime that I have ever seen. Clannad is mainly known for being a feels trip, and it is. If you didn't cry while watching Clannad (for some reason) than there's noway you'll survive After Story. The ending is foreshadowed throughout the entire anime, even back in the first season. The ending may seem confusing at first, but when looking back on the story, you can really see how each of the pieces fit together to actually make it make sense. The reason I give it a nine, instead of a ten is because, yes, it is confusing. I didn't really get it at first, and I had to do a little research and ask other people to completely understand it. But that's also what make Clannad so good. Because the ending isn't fully explained, it leaves it open to interpretation, so there really is no right answer.\\n\r\nArt- 9/10\\n\r\nClannad's art style looks very well done. The only complaint that I've seen about the art would be about the characters eyes. Personally, they didn't bother me that much, but I can see why it bothered others so I give it a nine. After watching the show though, I wouldn't really change the eyes though, because they sort of feel like a signature to Clannad, and I couldn't imagine it any other way.\\n\r\nSound- 10/10\\n\r\nI'm not usually impressed by anime's soundtracks, but Clannad has to have one of the best soundtracks. First off, the soundtrack is HUGE. There's so many songs to go along with every situation, that give it a lot of emotion during certain scenes. I most likely would not have cried during some scenes if it wasn't for the music. A few of my favorites from the soundtrack would be the opening, Fuko's theme, Shining in the Sky, The Place Where Wishes Come True, (this song will always make me cry) and of course the dango song.\\n\r\nCharacter- 10/10\\n\r\nI had to give Clannad a 10/10 for character, just because of how much character development there is. Almost each character got a backstory in Clannad which allowed you to understand, and actually feel sympathy for the characters, which is a pretty important thing in Clannad. I can't help but cry along with these characters when they're crying too.\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10/10\\n\r\nThis was a no-brainer for me. Clannad was one of the first few animes that I ever saw, and it's really what got me obsessed with anime. So because of that, I may be a little bit biased towards this anime, but I tried to fairly rate the other categories. This anime IS my all-time favorite, so a 10/10 is kind of a given.\\n\r\nOverall- 10/10\\n\r\nClannad is such a beautiful anime. The story it tells is pretty sad, no, VERY sad, but it shows how harsh life can be sometimes. Clannad: After Story already had one thing going for it from the start- it's different. Clannad was a harem anime, and we all know how those usually end. But in Clannad, the mc ACTUALLY CHOOSES A GIRL. Clannad: After Story takes this a step further and actually shows what happens after the two characters get together & what their lives become afterwards hence after story. If you are looking into watching After Story, I recommend you look at Clannad first. I wouldn't really consider it necessary, and if you really wanted to skip it, you'd probably enjoy it just fine, but Clannad gives a lot of character development, which is important if you want to enjoy this show to it's full potential.\\n\r\nSo that's my full review on Clannad! It was my first review, and I know it was a lot, but I tend to write a lot on most writing pieces I do anyway.. If you were unsure on whether to watch this or not... I hope this review helped. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good romance/ slice of life anime (although there is some supernatural parts to it)\\n\r\n-lzzy",

I watched this in 2012 and that was the last time I cried over an anime. This is just a pure masterpiece. \r\nStory: 10. The first season had a good story too, but my god the story in the sequel had me speechless. It starts off as a comedy at first and than it becomes deeper and deeper until you reached the Rock Bottom of feels. The symbolism is the best thing about this. Somany symbols and illusions, its like a Ray Bradbury book. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10. For an anime in 2008, it is FANTASTIC. The colors and brightness really come out. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9. The voice acting is great here too. When they scream or cry, it moves others. Although I've heard better, still is pretty good. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10. Character development is BY FAR the thing that the first season doesn't have. A fantastic job for Tomoya. Him and Nagisa are the greatest couple in anime. Plus, the new characters are fantastic too. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10. I watched this in 2 days. I was that hooked on it. I couldn't stop watching for my life. This anime and Anohana were the only two animes that made me cry. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: This has the evidence to make itself the greatest anime of all time. I'm not that big of a fan of Slice of Life or Romance anime, but its by far the greatest of those genres. Be sure to grab a couple of tissues while you're at it.",

            "content": "Story- 9/10\r\nShima: \"Love is like a firework from the past\u2026 it\u2019s more beautiful for it to go to pieces and scatter far off.\u201d \r\nThe story of Clannad After Story (CAS) manages to refine and mature it\u2019s emotional impact from its prequel, \u2018Clannad\u2019. The show basically starts off by continuing the same principles of Clannad; it just gives those last few characters their deserved individual attention. These story arcs carry a whole lot more impact than before because they just simple had more effect on the characters themselves. After a few episodes however, we start to see the characters grow up, so it is understandable thatthe life issues become far more mature. The fact that we can see these characters growing up and that we have been alongside the main characters this whole time, makes any of their struggles or joys, our struggles, and our joys. Indeed\u2026 tears will be shed. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I will never knock CAS ability to impact the viewer, its ability to construct a story isn\u2019t as great. As mentioned, CAS has to follow the better part of one person\u2019s entire life. This leads to some incredibly rushed parts of Okazaki\u2019s lifetime, and it leads to some really drawn out and emotional events. Thus the quality of the episodes were very varied. Finally, the ending of CAS\u2026 was emotionally confusing, to say the least. The show ended up trying to be as sad as possible, whilst being as happy as possible. But in reality, it just ended up being as much of a mess as I was emotionally.  \\n\\n\r\nSound/ art- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs with the emotional impact, the artwork was also greatly refined. There were some especially beautiful scenes that really captured the spirit of the moment. Otherwise, the animation still offers the same comedic value to those humorous scenes and still maintains the general charm of the original series. The soundtrack remains largely the same, with the exception of the amazing OP and the ending song. Having this constant through both series gives those repeated tracks even more depth and meaning and listening to them after finishing both series will bring back a flood of memories. The one problem I had with the soundtrack was the ending song. In general, the standard episode would end with a really touching scene. The atmosphere would then almost be completely destroyed by a really upbeat song with people skipping everywhere. It just ruins the moment. Anyway, here is the name of the beautiful OP sung by Lia \u2018Toki Wo Kizamu Uta\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAkio: \u2018So I\u2019m going as your friend #1; YO YO I\u2019m the MC Akio!\u2019\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Clannad are as wonderful as ever. Every character has a chance to shine in the end with their own, emotionally powerful story arc. What I loved more with CAS was that there were more group interactions, where as in Clannad, the focus was on individual development. So in a sense, Clannad did well to set the stage for those hilarious gatherings. It was particularly great to see Akio and Sanae, possibly the best anime couple ever, to become more involved in the story as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe only issue I had with the characters is pretty much the same that I had with Clannad; that some characters just disappeared after being developed. As the story continually focuses in on Okazaki, the other characters just start to vanish, as such, not much changes in their lives. Again, wasted potential here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (impact)- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI ended up absolutely loving everything with CAS. From the legendary Akio to the tomboy Kyou. From the hilarious Sunohara to the troll that is Tomoya. Besides from the defining qualities of the characters, I felt like I knew each animated design as a person. A person that I had shared many laughs and tears with. \\n\\n\r\nThe beautiful animation and soundtrack gave Clannad an irresistible charm and an unavoidable impact. Some scenes, through a combination of the characters and media, are and always will be some of the most powerful scenes in film today. CAS is certainly a moving masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9/10\\n\\n\r\n\u201cYour task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.\u201d Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi.\\n\\n\r\nClannad After Story will change the way you think about valuing love and friendship. At the end of the day, anything as beautiful and as touching as CAS should recommend itself to you as a human being. If not, hopefully this review has convinced you to do so anyway. \\n",

            "content": "Spoiler Free Review:\r\nThis series will literally change your view on life and help you understand what is really important. With light comedy and heavy hitting emotional scenes, this is a must watch slice of life anime that tackles real-world fears and difficulties. I laughed a few times and cried a great deal. As someone with depression and anxiety, I will give a fair warning to those with similar conditions. If you are not prepared, it will affect you to the extent that your body is in literal pain. Do not binge watch it like I foolishly did and watch it a little at a time.Please be very careful as you watch it and be mindful of your own health. Aside from that, this is one of the most beautiful anime I have had the pleasure to watch and it makes you really feel for every character. I highly recommend watching from the first season. I also recommend the Kyou/Ryou and Tomoyo alternate stories to help you understand the last actual episode of After Story and why things seem to restart. This anime is based on a fantastic game and those with knowledge of it easily understood what happened at the end of this anime. If you are confused at the end of episode 22, there are many explanations online or by other reviewers here. There is a very good explanation in the comments section of episode 22 on KissAnime. I don't do spoilers. I hope you get as much enjoyment and see the world differently after watching this series as I did. Enjoy the beautiful story of Clannad and the struggles of Tomoyo to protect what matters most.",

            "content": "I'm gonna be honest, I knew what was the so famous \"sad thing\" of this anime all along, but I still enjoyed it a lot and I'm gonna briefly review the experience I had watching Clannad After Story\r\nI really loved the plot of this \"season\" of Clannad because of the concept, all the romance anime I've watched end when the protagonist/s get married or when they form a couple, but this anime goes further than that as it shows how the couple get into the adult world and face all the situations that are related with it, and that's basically it, the plot takes aturn in the later episodes but if I said more I'd be spoiling a lot of important things.\\n\\n\r\nThe art-style and animation of the anime were fairly good, but there's something that I must remark, and that's the opening. I don't use to count openings/endings on my ratings, but this is a special case, the opening is amazing, it's so good in fact that you can easily notice that they've spent more money on just the opening than the amount they've spent in a single episode. After watching the 24 episodes it became my favorite opening of all time.\\n\\n\r\nThe ost is something I'll never forget. The song of the opening was very good and it felt nostalgic to hear the same voice that sang the opening of Angel Beats (I watched it before Clannad)... and I will never forget the Dango daikazoku song, I specially love one of the variants (instrumental version).\\n\\n\r\nThis is like a second season of an anime so assuming you've already watched Clannad there isn't as much character development as there was in the previous season, but I'll still rate \"Character\" with a 10 because if the character development had been bad I wouldn't have enjoyed the plot of the anime as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion.\\n\r\nAlthough the game would have give me a better experience I decided to watch the anime because it's much shorter, and I still enjoyed it, I mostly cried out of suffering watching this anime because I knew what would happen and in my mind I was like \"THIS IS SO GOOD BUT SOMETIME SOON SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN\" but either tears out of sadness or out of happiness I really loved it... I will never forget what this anime made me see.",

            "content": "Every person in the world with a slightest interst in anime has surely heard of Clannad Afterstory, which is being labeled as one of the best pieces of anime ever produced. Unfortunately, after watching it, it did not live up to expectations.\r\nThe story picks off where first season of Clannad ended. Storyline tries to follow Tomoya`s life after he successfully entered a romantic relationship with Nagisa. The episodes that still deal with life their high school life and lives of people somehow distantly connected to Tomoya, are simply redundant. They don`t offer anything to the overall feel of the show and they create number ofabsolutely unrealistic, ridiculous and quasi-sad situationsI. I don`t think that it would decrease show`s overall quality if they were scrapped alltogether. However, all-in-all I can undestand their presence in the series, as there surely are people who enjoy these kind of stories. Anyway, if you will either love (good for you) or hate first few episodes, as far as I`m concerned, real Clannad Afterstory starts after Tomoya`s graduation. Story arcs developed after this event, gave me a hint why Clannad is so popular. Plots were all well-crafted, thought provoking and most of all enjoyable and emotional. To see Tomoya try to deal with his everyday life and observe all the belivable and real problems is without a doubt very interesting. And if show did end with the 21st episode, Clannad would indeed be one of the better animes I`ve seen. BUT, for some reason, creators of this show had to ruin all their good work by 22nd Final episode, that send the whole story, so intriguingly built, to the gutter. Last episode simply did not make any sense in the context of what the previous episodes were trying to accomplish and I firmly believe that this kind of ending can be considered good only by someone who cannot face reality as it is. \\n\\n\r\nQuality of Afterstory are undenialbe and I`ve come to an understanding that there are people that enjoyed the ending. So all I can say is, I thoroughly reccommed all of you to watch both Clannad and Clannad Afterstory, but I must add that if you consider yourself more rationally and philosophically oriented and you just can`t stand those out of place happy ends, skip the last episode and I believe you will not be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall score without the last episode would be 9, and with the last episode it would be 5...so that leaves me with the average of 7.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I for one was glad that i didnt quit and finished it to the end.  For those who hit the point in whichi am talking of please keep hope cause i learned in this anime the end justfied the means.  I believe myself to being someone who can give a review by putting all emotions and sentiments aside but I also learned that this anime is something that cant be described but seen.  I think this anime was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen and I think it outdid all its previous works in that aspect.  This anime is a masterpiece to me and shall forever keep it with me.",

            "content": "Story - Brilliant. Superb. In afterstory, I would say the plot moves much faster than the original Clannad. This, however, is by no means a bad thing. We are introduced to more of the cast. Afterstory captures the transition one has to deal with when moving on from school, into society, and tells that story through the eyes of our protagonist.\r\nCharacter -  The characters each hold  their own distinct personalities, to the point they seem almost like real life people. As the world changes, they adapt to it, and they themselves change. One perfect example would be  Tomoya Okazaki, our main protagonist.He experiences happiness, proceeds to suffer great loss, enters a period of denial and grieving, goes on to conquer his despair and make amends, yet is soon greeted with another loss. Then, the story takes a complete turn, effectively rewriting most of what you've watched, and all ends in a more or less happy ending. Through all of this, we see complex humane emotions exerted, to a degree of shocking realism. \\n\\n\r\nSound - Wonderful. The music fits the theme. The soundtrack is constructed masterfully, and is fitted into the story at appropriate parts perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nArt - The only flaw in the art would be the character designs. They seem somewhat similar, lacking much uniqueness. The landscapes and backgrounds are another story entirely. They look amazing, to the point that each and every single one seems like a painting done by some artistic genius. \\n\\n\r\n Clannad is an anime that is definitely worth a watch. It blends in a serious drama esque mood with lighthearted humor, jokes, and other aspects of traditional anime. Above all, it is unique. Whenever I see an anime that seems to stand apart from the rest, I typically hold high hopes for them. Clannad, despite pioneering in a direction scarcely taken, it has carved out success and a huge fan base. Once again, please give it a go!",

So I'm sincerely writing this with my own words, taking the two seasons into account\r\nClannad is not about romance, but rather about love and relations with people that care in your life.  It's funny. It's dramatic. It's pleasurable. But i have never cried so much times watching an anime before. It was about 10 times or so for clannad after story and 3 times for clannad. However I didn't cry just because the scenes and climax arevery well constructed, but I felt a lot identified with the backstory of the characters, which each one that is relevant to the story is well developed, specially with sakagami tomoyo's past. The soundtrack is also gorgeous and combine to each situation.\\n\r\nI have been seen the reality on one side, but Clannad influenced and changed the way i look for the world and the values of life. It took the melancholy out of my life and now I actually care about to live.\\n\r\nOverall, this franchise also works a lot with emotions and the consequence that it can cause to who is around us. The scripting can surprise anyone and make you think about the things in a different way, depending on how do you receive and  interpret them. If you haven't seen this anime before, just give it a chance",

Before I start raving about how indescribably marvelous Clannad: After Story is, I guess I should say what attracted me to it at first. I'm a sucker for soundtracks, so I found this while looking at soundtracks from other anime I had seen. It seemed everyone was in agreement that Clannad has one of the best soundtracks out there,  so I couldn't help but try watching the anime. I didn't even get through the first scene of the first episode before I wentand downloaded the entire soundtrack. The soundtrack for this anime is HANDS DOWN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SOUNDTRACK ANIME HAS TO OFFER.\\n\r\nI didn't really understand why the soundtrack was so emotional while watching the first season of Clannad, because the anime seemed pretty light and happy. It wasn't until watching After Story that I came to realize just how fitting it really was. Clannad: After Story combines a truly touching story with one of the greatest soundtracks of all time to create what can only be described as the masterpiece that transcends masterpieces. 11/10 for Clannad: After Story.\\n\r\nI couldn't live with myself if I didn't at least say something about the story and characters. If you are someone who likes action like myself, the first season might be a little boring at first. But it's necessary to get to know the characters. Whatever you do, do not stop watching, or skip to After Story until you finish it. Because this is a story about growing up. We get to follow these people's story of friendship and family through the good times and the bad. It's not over the top, it's not cliche, it's perfectly human. \\n\r\nThe terrific portrayal of the hardships and loss we all face on our journey through life brings about a new appreciation of our own lives. That's what makes this a story that everyone should hear. I would say do not miss it for the world, but this anime shows us that the one's we love are what's most important, so make sure you watch it with them. Because there will be an end to your story, just like there is an end to this one, so treasure every moment. Even if you never watch anything else in your life, watch Clannad and Clannad: After Story, the greatest anime series of all time.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. If you don't shed at least one tear while watching this anime, then you must not be human. I have not ever read or watched anything more tear jerking than Clannad: After Story in my entire life, nor do I believe I ever will again.",

            "content": "Even if i didnt enjoy this season that much at the beginning (episodes 1 to 9) because it seemed way story less after that it picked up the pace for me. After  those annoying First episodes that i believe can push anybody away from this anime the real story started.  Passing through what everyone is likely to go through at some moment in life. The tragedy behind this story leaves me speechless and heartbroken, The #1 reason why i would rate this as one of the better animes ive seen is because ive never cried so much in anime. And ive seen animesthat are generally considered the saddest ones. \\n\r\nThis anime has been so sad for me because of what the male main character passes through is unbearable to me.  Like everyone else in this world  the thought of some of our greatest fears can bring tears to your eyes. And this anime managed to get to where i fear the most. To be completely lost to just get found and lost again. Realistically i would think the character on this anime would have committed suicide. I know i would definitely consider it allot if something like this where to happen to me.\\n\r\nEpisode 23 was by me rated like 7 (boring and story less tho sort of nice how help comes before they met) \\n\r\nEpisode fell like a treat on the last 5 or so minutes.  it went over the really sad part and it showed an ending that leaves in my opinion little to no doubt.  (first half of episodes 24 was sort of boring tho)",

            "content": "I have never cried for an anime before, and I know few people who have. And I'm not talking about crying out of intense joy or relief.The kind of crying that I'm talking about is SADNESS. GRIEF. SORROW. DEPRESSION. All of those emotions are what I wanted one day to experience from an anime. So, I asked my peers for recommendations. Of the many anime that they all talked about, (Anohana, Toradora, and Kanon, among others) one of the most commonly recommended anime I kept hearing about was a little visual novel-turned-anime commonly known as CLANNAD, and (especially) its sequel, CLANNAD ~AFTER STORY~. I couldn\u2019twait to begin.\\n\\n\r\n!!SPOILER WARNING: I WILL BE TALKING ABOUT IMPORTANT PLOT POINTS IN BOTH SEASONS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!\\n\\n\r\nStory of CLANNAD (Season 1): So I was told that CLANNAD After Story would be the sad part of the series. This isn\u2019t entirely true; there were many parts in CLANNAD alone that made my eyes start to water. The Ibuki Fuko arc was sad, the Kotomi arc was sad, and the Nagisa arc was sad. The only thing that saved my eyes from actually watering was the immense amount of humor presented in CLANNAD. However, the humor was not why I kept watching. I kept watching for the interesting, cliff-hanger-full story, so the downtime between the Fuko and Kotomi arc; I have to say, quite bored me. Overall; though, the story of CLANNAD was great, and it was better than I hoped. Many people say that the first season isn't needed to watch the AFTER STORY, but I believe the first season is definitely needed if you want to feel the intensity of the emotional roller-coaster of AFTER STORY to its fullest.\\n\\n\r\nStory of AFTER STORY: The story of AFTER STORY is much better than that of CLANNAD, and I think anyone can agree to that. Now, was my goal of crying during an anime reached? I have to say not really; however, CLANNAD and AFTER STORY was a very powerful show which moved me greatly and made my heart ache constantly. My eyes watered countless, countless times during this anime and I believe that counts for something. This was definitely an amazing anime that I am immensely glad to have had the privilege of watching. What makes it so great is that it is a romance / drama / slice-of-life which takes place after high school. Which means after getting jobs, after getting married, and even after having a child, which I have seen NO OTHER anime of the same genre do before. And thus, AFTER STORY also seems like an anime that could fit the role of being an \u201cafter story\u201d for ANY romance/drama/slice-of-life anime out there, which isn't necessarily a good or bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nAs many would expect, AFTER STORY focuses specifically on Tomoya and Nagisa\u2019s relationship. However, this begins EIGHT episodes into the series. This causes (in my opinion) a few problems:\\n\\n\r\n1) Characters who had big roles in the first 8 eps are reduced to minor, minor characters suddenly.\\n\\n\r\n2) Tomoya and Nagisa\u2019s relationship develops super quickly.\\n\\n\r\nFor example:\\n\\n\r\na) So, too shy to hold hands, but you guys are comfortable having unprotected sex? ok.\\n\\n\r\nb) So, you\u2019ve known each other for one year, been going out for a few months and now you want to be married? sure.\\n\\n\r\nAnother question: Why did Tomoya agree to have a baby with Nagisa so soon if he knew she has a weak and frail body? Didn\u2019t think about that, did he?\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I digress; let's talk about the ending of the story. Honestly, the ending was fine to me, with Nagisa and Ushio being brought back to life, but I thought it wasn\u2019t necessary. Before you call me a jerk, I think the story would have ended just as nicely with Tomoya staying as a single parent for Ushio and learning to not linger in the past. But nonetheless, the ending was good, though maybe a bit too fairy-tale-y with all the balls of light and stuff magically floating into the sky. All in all, I think CLANNAD ~AFTER STORY~ had a magnificent story. Not perfect; mind you, but very good and very satisfying. Although I did not cry per se for this story, it truly did have a lasting, heart-warming/heart-aching effect on me and I greatly enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:There are lots of characters in CLANNAD and they each have their own personalities, dreams, and backgrounds. These characters are so nicely done in fact that it\u2019s a pity that almost none of them get proper roles in the story. For example, Ichinose Kotomi is given her own arc in CLANNAD and she is even revealed to be a childhood friend of Tomoya\u2019s. But for some reason, after her arc, she has ABSOLUTELY NO ROLE to play in the series. She\u2019s just kinda.. there. Looking back, though, Fujibayashi Ryou is in the same character crisis, except Ryou has no arc to call her own, which again, is quite a pity.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Designs: Now let\u2019s talk character designs. Unfortunately, the character designs in this series are not exactly the best in the world. First we\u2019ve got the Fujibayashi sisters as well as Kotomi who all have purple hair. Next, we have Tomoya and Akio with the exact same hair style as well as Tomoya and Yoshino sporting the exact same blue hair color (they also wear the same uniform at work making it incredibly difficult to tell them apart) . Finally, we have Misae and Mei Sunohara, with the same dark blue hair color and similar face shapes. Overall, the characters of CLANNAD are very lovable and fun to watch, but it\u2019s unfortunate that some of them don\u2019t have unique roles or designs.\\n\\n\r\nThe Arts ~Music:The music and sound of CLANNAD are pretty standard anime fare. We have the great OPs and EDs MeguMeru, Dango Daikazoku, Toki o Kizamu Uta, and Torch. We also have the background music and the few OSTs that stand out like Etude Pour Les Petites Supercordes (Kotomi's theme). The only thing I feel like I should mention about the music is that Torch is a mood-killer.. That's all I have to say. Overall, the music is great but not super amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe Arts ~Animation/Art:Obviously, the art for this show is quite unique for anime. Honestly, before I ever even so much as thought about watching this series, the huge full-of-highlights eyes was a turn off because I, at the time, thought it made the characters look like creepy, lifeless dolls. Thankfully, I gave this anime a chance and I was able to grow to greatly enjoy the art in less than a couple episodes (especially in HD!). Kyoto Animation (or Kyo-Ani) is well-known for its great character art as well as their periodical scenes of super high-quality animation. These instances of high-quality animation in CLANNAD are mostly concentrated during the \u201cIllusionary World\u201d scenes starring the girl and her hand-built robot. Now to be honest, I\u2019m not one to watch an anime and think to myself, \u201cWow, this anime has good animation\u201d or \u201cWow, the animation in this anime is not good\u201d. But I have to say that Kyo-Ani may have been the very first animation studio to make me say the former. And of course, the animation in CLANNAD and AFTER STORY are much, much better than the cringe-inducing , old-fashioned job done by Toei Animation for the 2007 CLANNAD Movie.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:Going into CLANNAD, I expected to cry, and leave the show being able to say that I shed tears for an anime. What I experienced was an anime with a heart-breaking / heart- warming story, funny but static characters and designs, great music, and unique artwork.\\n\\n\r\nThe way I rate anime is weighted heavily on my enjoyment of the anime (after all, anime at its core is a source of entertainment and enjoyment). Also, although I may seem to nitpick and whatnot, my scores for anime, I think, are generally higher than most people, since again, the main thing I take into account is the enjoyment factor. And I can definitely say without a doubt that I greatly enjoyed this anime and I believe I can strongly recommend this to ANYONE who likes slice-of-life, romance, drama, comedy, tear-jerkers, etc.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Thank you for reading! See you next time.\\n\\n\r\n~Andre Kumori, December 29, 2013",

            "content": "A review with perfect scores usually contains the following properties:\r\n-Heavily biased\r\n-Written by fan-boys or fan-girls\r\n-Contains little to no useful information \r\n-Frowned upon in general\r\nI am fully aware of the negative effects if I were to give this review a perfect score. I had initially thought about lowering the ratings of certain categories, but came to the realization that one should not intentionally abstain from giving a series its deserving flawless ratings just so it would go with the norm, and Clannad After Story, in my humble opinion, is one of such show.\r\nBefore reading further, please note that this review could contain minor spoilers. While itdoes not contain actual description of events, the general structure of the story will be touched. If you want a complete fresh experience of the show, I'd recommend you read no further.\\n\\n\r\nClannad After Story is the continuation of Clannad, focusing on the life of two characters after they started dating at the end of the first season, but side-stories of several sub-characters are told in the first half of the series. These little stories don't actually have much of an impact to the main storyline, and the characters might not even feel all that interesting initially. However, through the enchanting plot crafted by the talented creators, I found myself tearing at the end of each little tale. As a guy, I have to say it is not something I am too proud of =/\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 10\\n\r\nKyoAni (the production company) did not disappoint its fans once again. Fluid animations, breath-taking sceneries, accurately depicted character expressions, meticulously detailed backgrounds, nothing but \"impressive\" describes the animation of Clannad After Story. As an example of the power of the visuals, it has given such a strong flavour to the town and seasons in the show, it is almost at a level where the viewer can feel and long for. An easy 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10\\n\r\nI have always wondered whether this category includes the music. It does not make sense how a review could lack a category for music, as it is possibly the most important factor in bringing out the atmosphere and emotion of a scene, but grouping music as \"Sound\" is slightly, just slightly, insulting if anything. I suppose I'll just have to make do.\\n\\n\r\nNot a whole lot to comment for the character voices, you get your usual anime-pitched female voices and a myriad of other voices for various stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the BGM, just like Air and Kanon, Clannad reuses the music from the game. The Key composers - Maeda Jun, Togoshi Magome and Orito Shinji have again done a wonderful job in delivering the perfect atmosphere, some scenes are so touching it leaves the viewer in awe, yearning for more. Even though simple and synthesized, no one can deny the perfect harmony between the music, the characters and the world. I think music has so much of an influence that without these seemingly magical themes, Clannad After Story would not even be half as enjoying.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10\\n\r\nTo be honest, the story is fairly simple and straightforward. There are no jaw-dropping twists, nerve-racking suspense, or mind-blowing actions. It's just life story of several characters and that's that. But, the best story is not always the one with the most content or concrete happenings - it is the one that can drive you to love, hate, or simply care about some imaginary characters in some imaginary plot.\\n\\n\r\nThere are far too many sub-characters that I first thought are uninteresting and generic. But time and time again I was proven wrong and at the end of each story I'd be loving the characters and thought they have every reason in the world to be in the show. Keep in mind that these stories are told in just 2 to 3 episodes, but it was so well presented/written/expressed, I was just sitting there, stunned, amazed at how the writers could manipulate the emotions of the viewers at will, almost effortlessly. And to think that they are just little side stories.\\n\\n\r\nSuppose the impact of a story is linearly proportional to its length, or in other words, the number of episodes. And suppose this proposition applies to this show. Now you could probably derive how much of a force could the main story be. Yes it's pretty bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10\\n\\n\r\nBeing a Key story, one should probably not expect much in terms of variety of character traits. As generic or over-used as the personalities may be, they just somehow work with Key's style of story telling. Personally, I am not too big of a fan of weak, sickly, female characters, and the maine heroine just incidentally happen to be one. But that's the beauty of the show, the first impressions on the characters do not really matter, because it will make you like them, without you knowing, subconsciously.\\n\\n\r\nValue 10\\n\\n\r\nI find it hard to quantify how much a series is worth usually. I guess value is heavily tied with the general impression on the show, and for how much I love and praise Clannad After Story, I don't think its value can be anything less than perfect. Even though the romance, the plot, and the characters are probably not too convincing when it comes to real life and that you would probably not gain much in terms of life lessons after watching it, its true value lie at the times when you are alone, reminiscing all about it and feeling how lovely the story, the characters are. And as unrealistic as the story events could be, sometimes, just sometimes, one can not help but silently wonder how sweet it could be if it ever happens to themselves.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\\n\r\nClannad After Story is a anime of contrasts. It is not surprising to find yourself laughing happily at one episode, and depressed at the next. It has its comedy moments, but also its serious drama business. I suppose it's hard to argue it's un-enjoyable when you get the two spectrum of the world.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10\\n\\n\r\nAnyone who is reading this review would already know Clannad After Story is a romance show, but it is worthwhile to note that it features a very different sort of romance, or at least a different phase. In brief, there are 3 stages in romance - the first when the characters meet, know and discover each other, and eventually feeling something special - budding of romance; the second stage begins when the characters start dating, where they will learn about the definition of love, to accept the flaws of each other and to realize if he or she is the special one in their life - mutual acceptance; and ultimately the final stage when the characters are ready to commit to each other - marriage and family.\\n\\n\r\nIt is undeniable that majority of anime focuses on the first phase, but it makes sense - the audience is generally teenagers and young people, and it is the angst, hot and passionate feeling that excites us; no one would be interested in a dull family story. But this is what makes Clannad After Story special, it is a story about family, about struggle, about happiness, about sacrifice, about what it means to love. And it proves how beautiful a family story can be.\\n\\n\r\nOpinions are subjective, there are good and bad ones, but not right or wrong ones. Opinions are affected by a variety of factors on the individual - personality, emotion, experience, upbringing, etc. It might be a little harsh to say this, but I believe that to truly appreciate Clannad After Story, one might need to be of a certain age to understand romance, and personal experience that relates with it is always a plus. With that said, Clannad After Story should still make a decent watch for everyone, given its solid amount of comedic material.\\n\\n\r\nAnother successful element of Clannad After Story is its presentation. A lot of times, there'd be scenes where characters would say some cheesy lines in some cheesy fashion, but the music, the atmosphere, the presentation is done so well, you could feel nothing but touched. Certain formulae are used again and again *coughspiritualbeingcough* but it never gets old. A simple story with simple characters, yet it is powerful enough to drive people into tears. All of this is attributed to its presentation - a perfect concordance of visual, music and atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude the review, Clannad After Story is a anime saturated with emotions, it is a story not to be watched, but to be felt.",

            "content": "Story: 10\r\nClannad After Story is a continuation on Nagisa's story, starting off where we had left off. Tomoya and Nagisa go through their troubles. You get to see the life of someone and their troubles which are realistic except for the lights and the other world. People can relate to this story in some way, be it a sick relative or someone who is close to you who have passed away. Not only is it realistic, it grabs at you.\r\nEven though I like the slife of life genre, not a like keep me hooked on it. It's just nice for a one in a whilewatch. But with drama mixed in, you get quite the perfect story, making me give this area a 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nI never find anything to say in this area but I will say my thoughts. I think the art has dropped. I think it's because the artists aren't taking it so seriously. I don't know why. In Clannad, you can see strands of hair. In After Story, it's a blob of different colours. Though you can still tell it's hair. The backgrounds though were wonderful. As beautiful and touching as ever.\\n\\n\r\n*Add-in~ I just noticed, you can actually tell that the characters have grown up if you compare Clannad next to Clannad After Story. I found it really noticeable in Nagisa in the Clannad OP. Yay for obvious grown-up-ness!!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nI loved the opening. It was like a song of hope to me. It fitted very well with the story. The ending I can't say the same. At the end of the saddest episode, when you're pouring your eyes out, you hear this cheerful tune and see a child happily skipping along. The sudden change in mood, isn't my thing. I would've preferred to stay in my little emo corner and cry my heart out. It is a nice tune, just doesn't fit in with the story.\\n\r\nBGM, however, is lovely. There are so many tracks that I absolutely love. And there are not a lot of BGM that I love. All BGM fits in perfectly with its designated scene. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is one of the things I look for in anime and manga. I like to see how someone has changed due to their experiences. It's more realistic like that. For example, look at Sunohara, as happy-go-lucky as ever, yet you can still notice a slight change. He's become more serious in what he wants to do. Tomoya is a huge example. He became one bored delinquent to a really caring guy who anyone can love.\\n\r\nThe characters are each unique and individual. I love them all!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall: 10\\n\\n\r\nWow, I never knew watching an anime can make me cry in joy AND sorrow. It's only Clannad that it's ever happened to me. Clannad really touches your heart and is so realistic you can't help but enjoy it.\\n\r\nI've read quite a few reviews saying how the ending of this series was rushed and slightly disappointing. It ended just the way I liked it for me, a nice sweet ending. \\n\\n\r\nWoo!!!! Go Clannad!!!!!",

Their rituals involve re-enacting the weird robot-little girl play as a method of aligning themselves with the cosmic forces.\\n\\n\r\nKotomi's scream in Season 1 led to Shinzo Abe's re-election in 2014 when he used it in ad campaigns against the opposition.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Story is a tour de force monument of history precursor to contemporary strains of magical realism social commentary exquisite aesthetical masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nEven detractors (Who are obviously wrong) like Critic Alex Sheremet had this to say:\\n\\n\r\n\"Clannad After Story- obviously a cheap \u2018romance\u2019 anime with terrible humor and really bad writing- had a scene or two I thought was really well-written and excellently shot\"\\n\\n\r\nRoger Ebert, before he died, left this quote from a secret review hidden on his hard drive:\\n\\n\r\n\"I am not sure there can be an answer to these questions. The end sequence plays like music, not drama: It completes the story on an emotional, not a literal, level. We end not on carnage but on redemption, which is the goal of so many of Maeda's characters. They despise themselves, they live in sin, they occupy mean streets, but they want to be forgiven and admired. Whether Tomoya gains that status in reality or only in his mind is not the point; throughout the film, his mental state has shaped his reality, and at last, in some way, it has brought him a kind of peace.\"\\n\\n\r\n10/10 Must Experience Once In Lifetime",

            "content": "Please don't take this as a personal attack, but I found that Clannad Afterstory was mediocre. I'll do my best not to offend anybody because I know this was hugely popular, and I'll emphasize that you don't need to read this if it will make you angry, scared or confused. Everything I will write in this review is my personal opinion and if you're upset that it differs from your own then.....don't be because it really doesn't matter.\r\nI watched this after finishing Clannad (season 1) by recommendation from a close friend, and quite frankly I was kind of underwhelmed. It's been a little while so.....takea moment to decide if you'll be emotionally compromised by reading a review that doesn't compliment this series and if you will.....just keep scrolling down. \\n\\n\r\nStill here? Okay please don't kill me.\\n\\n\r\nStory 5/10\\n\r\nI found the story was pretty mediocre. Tomoya pretty much takes whatever life throws at him and I didn't really see much more than that. A lot of sad things happen to him but I wasn't really phased by any of it. I applaud him for handling the whole ordeal pretty well, but as a story I wasn't really impressed by anything that was written; just....sad things happened to him.\\n\r\nThere was an interesting bit about the hidden world throughout the entire series, but the more I try to explain it the more I find that there isn't really enough evidence in the series to explain what's happening with it. I understand that there are outside resources that explain it (I've read some stuff online), but strictly talking about Clannad Afterstory the TV anime series, it's a plot hole.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10\\n\r\nPersonally I'm not a fan of this era of Kyoto Animation's art style. The animation is really good, but I find that the eyes creep me out. That's a personal opinion and not a point of criticism, but I will criticize how similar the characters looked to me. When I first started watching I had trouble differentiating the girls from one another. If you were to show me a picture of all the girls in black and white I don't think I'd be able to identify them and personally I just think that's a result of lazy art. That might not be the case for you, but I feel that the artists could have done a better job in putting some more detail in features other than eye and hair colour in each character.\\n\r\nI will compliment Kyoto's animation and background art though. They do an incredible job in making every day scenes. My beef is just with the character art.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe music was pretty good. I found the dango song pretty perfect for the mood of the show, and the way they used it was very well done. Good job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\r\nOkay, here's where I might hurt your feelings. I didn't like Nagisa. I felt like she was a little too childish (is that the word? Maybe clumsy? Bubbly? Something along the lines of light-headed) to be convincing as a lead character. Sure, there were moments that she seems more mature in this season, but to me that kind of development seemed like the same change you experience when you go to the principle's office for crushing someone's sand fort for the first time. She just really didn't appeal to me.\\n\r\nI mean, I guess a lot of the development happened in the first season, but the second season doesn't really offer anything new about the characters. I never found a connection to the characters which may be the reason I missed out in enjoying the series.\\n\r\nI did enjoy the parts about Akio and his baseball battles with Tomoyo. It was pretty interesting and empowering to see this guy be a father even though a lot of the time it seems like he's just dicking around. If there's one thing that saves my opinion about the characters in the series, it's Akio.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\r\nI didn't really find a lot of enjoyment in watching this. I really wanted to finish it because a close friend had recommended it to me, but afterwards I didn't really feel like I had enjoyed it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\r\nClannad Afterstory was just mediocre for me. Was it worth it to watch? Not really. I remember feeling a little....resentful (bitter? not sure on what word to use here).....while watching this because of how good and kind all the characters were. I think my exact thought was something like \"I enjoy seeing realistic, corrupted people in cartoons and would rather see pure, kind-hearted people in real life,\" and watching this show kind of riled me up because it was the opposite. I guess it doesn't really make much sense, but all I'm trying to say is that it irritated me seeing kind people in the show. Whether you understand that feeling or not doesn't really matter.\\n\\n\r\nWell if you're still reading I'd like to thank you for putting up with me this far and to remind you that this is all my opinion, and that I'm just a dog behind a keyboard surfing the interwebs. This show was rated very highly because it was popular with its viewers, but to me that doesn't mean it's good. And I guess that's the reason I'm writing all this even though it might mean some hate.....because I disagree with it being up here. \\n\r\nDon't let me take away from you enjoying the show. If you're reading this wondering whether or not you should watch it, I just ask that you ask yourself how much you consider other people enjoying it is a factor in your own enjoyment. If it doesn't matter then I don't think it's really worth the watch. If it does then this is one of the greatest anime's ever created. And for everyone who's reading this regardless of the reason......please don't kill me.",

            "content": "It's been a while since I watched Clannad After Story. It was only after watching an AMV on Youtube and realizing that every scene of After Story has sent a shiver through me that I realized just how much of an effect After Story had on me.\r\nAs most of you probably know, this show is the second season of Clannad. While Clannad is arguably worse, DO NOT SKIP IT, since the character development in the first season is absolutely necessary for you to enjoy this show to its fullest.\r\ntl;dr With absolutely brilliant character development and story progression, Clannad After Story is the prefect example ofan emotional story done right, with only a few minor flaws.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\r\nClannad After Story starts off right where Clannad ended, with Okazaki and Nagisa beginning their new relationship. The first ten episodes all take place within the same highschool with the same likeable characters from the first season.\\n\r\nHowever, while it still carried the familiar charm of the first season, these initial ten episodes were by far the weakest in the series. It felt as though the show was just trying to redo what it had already been done. The jokes seemed a little less funny and I was enjoying myself a little less. So why did I still rate the story a 9? It's because after the tenth episode, the show ventures into territory few other anime have dared to explore - life after school.\\n\r\nClannad After Story doesn't restrict itself to the high school grounds - the you see Okazaki struggle to find a job, to earn a living, to live on his own. You see how life treats him as a single worker, working a menial job, with few luxuries to comfort him. Watching his life after education was an experience like no other anime had offered me ever before, and I was mesmerized.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nNot much to say here. KyoAni is well known for dishing out beautiful animation, and it has had a lot of experience in this area (with similar works being Kanon and Air). The show looks great, and the snow, a recurring theme in the story, looks absolutely beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nThe Clannad Soundtrack is the soundtrack that made me realize the true beauty of anime music, and led me to appreciate instrumentals as a whole. From beautiful piano solos to its masterful use of ethereal sounds, this soundtrack is by far my favourite of any I have listened to. If I had to point out any fault at all, it would be the fact that some songs seem a bit too long, but it didn't bother me too much. My personal favourite is Shionari, or Roaring Tides.\\n\r\nWhile I am not a fan of dubs in general, I must say that the Clannad dub seems worse than most other dubs I came across, so I would definitely recommend the sub for this show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nRemoving the larger cast of characters for the majority of the show ended up being a boon. It allowed the show to expand upon Okazaki's relationship with Nagisa, allowing us to see them understand each other and appreciate each other more as the show goes on. We see Okazaki cope with the hurdles that life throw at him, and we see Nagisa supporting him throughout. We see Okazaki mature and learn to forgive those he had earlier treated with contempt. We see his mannerisms change as he learns how to adapt into adult society. We see his life progress as he finally matures from the sarcastic adolescent he once was to the responsible adult that he should be. And throughout, you see the both tragic and euphoric events that shape his life to become what it is now. This is perhaps the best part of After Story.\\n\r\nWhile Okazaki's character development is definitely something to admire, Nagisa, on the other hand receives comparitively less. This could do witht he fact that Okazaki is the protagonist of the show; however, seeing Nagisa grow from her fragile emotional state to someone who could stand up for herself is a dream only half realized, and the sole reason that I deducted one point in this category.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9\\n\r\nBefore watching Clannad + After Story, I watched Anohana. I saw people posting online about how much they had cried at the ending, how much the final scenes had affected them. However, when I finished the series, I only felt a slight twinge. It was powerful, yes, but not powerful enough to make me cry. Perhaps I was closed off to the emotions of the show I was watching? Maybe so. So when I found a tear rolling down my face while watching After Story, I was surprised. That, above all, is a testament to the sheer power and brilliance this show embodies. I never cried because of an anime before After Story, and I doubt I ever will again.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict - 9\\n\r\nApart from those weak ten episodes, and not much character development for Nagisa, Clannad After Story is the closest to a perfect show you can ever find, and perhaps the greatest romance show I have ever watched.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS\\n\r\nThe Ending....\\n\r\nThose of you who have watched the show may be wondering why I haven't mentioned the ending, which is cursed all across the internet. The reason is - I thought it was a pretty good ending. Yes, I said it. Most people were angered by the fact that they felt like it destroyed the whole point of the show. I admit that I was taken by surprise by the ending, and I was a little annoyed. But above all, I was relieved. Throughout the show, while I watched Okazaki suffer, the only thing I was sure of was that Okazaki, Nagisa, and their family deserved a happy end. Well, the ending of After Story gave them one, and that was enough for me.",

After Story is a brilliant anime that is cute, funny, and tragic which connects with its viewers emotionally unlike any other series before it, leaving it nothing less than a masterpiece. \r\nWhile I did praise After Story more than any other series I've seen, I could not help but notice that Clannad's characters are almost too similar to those in Air, one of Key's other visual novels that came before Clannad. However, this is not to say that I disliked the characters. I enjoyed it very muchbecause of how dynamic the characters turned out to be and how they were enjoyable to begin with. Several characters, mostly Tomoya, go through incredible character development, the likes I haven't seen in any other anime.\\n\\n\r\nLike Key's other visual novels, the story played out brilliantly where you could not help but shed a tear here and there. Unlike it's predecessor, After Story made a much greater emotional impact on me than I originally thought it would. However, the actual story of After Story does not begin until the first eight episodes are finished, where the story arcs of Sunohara Youhei, Misae Sagara, and Sakagami Tomoyo. It's obvious that After Story is all about Tomoya and Nagisa, and these characters feel like they were just thrown in because they couldn't fit in the first season. But it wasn't that big of a bother anyway, because even those story arcs were touching. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, After Story is brilliant show that is unprecedented in many ways. Even with a few problems here and there, and a story line that shed tears and confused even more people, After Story is, like stated above, a life-changing experience that can inspire anyone.",

            "content": "So, I'm reviewing Clannad and Clannad: Afterstory at once. First, some brief knowledge dumping: Clannad and its Afterstory are an adaptation of the Clannad visual novel, animated by Kyoto Animation. The Clannad story comes in two parts. First, you have the original Clannad series which is essentially your average high-school harem rom-com. Next comes Clannad:Afterstory, which picks up where the original story left off and moves in a completely different direction, following the characters out of high school and into the real world where it focuses on the very real and very personal struggles of life. It's a tale about life, loss, love and mostof all family. \\n\\n\r\nYou've probably heard a lot about Clannad by now. The show is relatively famous, and is consistently held up as a masterpiece of emotional manipulation and dramatic storytelling. It's difficult to break down Clannad into subcategories of story, art, sound etc. because the show's strongest points are when it weaves these together to create a sum greater than the parts. We'll start with a breakdown though, and then we'll get into the more complex details.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the Clannad story is that it is wildly inconsistent. At times, it proves itself to be absolutely brilliant. It's capable of building upon itself in creative ways, making amazing use of well-established characters and culminating in some of the most powerful scenes I have ever seen. The drawback is that when it's not being incredible, it's usually fairly weak. Clannad likes to deviate on side-stories completely unrelated to the main plot in which it quickly develops characters that are never seen again. When you adapt a visual novel into a show, you have to understand that the two operate differently. In attempting to inject as many characters and elements from the visual novel as it can, Clannad clogs up its episodes with bland deviations from the main plot. In addition, the entire first season of the show is fairly mediocre. Asides from a few essential moments of development for the main protagonists it is just introducing us to love interest after love interest, all of who become completely redundant by the end of the first season and are barely ever seen again. The whole first season could easily have been condensed to six or seven episodes and tacked on to the beginning of Afterstory in place of the irrelevant side stories present there.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was quite frankly jarring. For a show that was trying to build up your attachment to its characters by making them as human as possible, the moe eyes-the-size-of-your-face style was completely out of place. There was also too much visual novel conversation, with people standing statically right in front of each other. Clannad often lacked in the body language or movement of its already alien-looking characters that it really could have used. This is actually surprising, considering that Kyoto Animation has been known to absolutely excel in body language and small character movements, with shows like Haruhi Suzumiya or Hyouka being visually transcendent. I will confess though, the show's use of lighting was oftentimes very impressive, and there are a series of scenes between a young girl and a robot scattered throughout both seasons that are animated in somewhat different style and are completely gorgeous.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music in Clannad and Afterstory is pretty astounding. All of it is absolutely essential to setting the tone of the story, and most of the tracks do an incredible job of slowly establishing feeling behind themselves regardless of what is happening in the show. I feel the need to give special mention of the show's use of a single song, however (which has several variations throughout the show). Dango Daikozuku rocked the freakin' day. Not only did it fit the show's tone perfectly throughout, its introduction as a part of the plot in the first season gave it a tangible meaning and connection to the characters. In the second season, when it appeared constantly in the form of the track 'Nagisa' the effect was absolutely devastating. It is an amazing testimony to how well a song can be used in a show to create emotional impact by lending meaning to the music past just how it sounds. On the flip side though, I would like to make special mention of how absolutely disastrous the show's second ending theme was. Late into the second season it was capable of single-handedly ruining the emotion and tension of the end of the episode with its aggresive, loud and peppy howl. I became accustomed to pausing the show the instant the episode ended to prevent what I had just experienced from being ruined by that musical incarnation of Satan.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nJust like most of the show, Clannad's characters are wildly inconsistent. The two main protagonists are a girl named Nagisa and a guy named Tomoya, and the difference in quality between them is extremely drastic. Tomoya is an extremely solid character: he suffers from a bit of VN protagonist syndrome in the side arcs, but his development is impressive and he is certainly not without human flaws. Tomoya's struggle to adjust to the working world and come to terms with his future, along with his conflict with his father and his own fear of ending up just like him are extremely compelling. He tries to be kind, but he's sometimes selfish and is bad at putting things in perspective. One could make the argument that Clannad is about Tomoya's journey and what he learns about life in the process. On the other hand, you have Nagisa. Nagisa is a saint. She is quiet, polite, caring, compassionate, selfless, and essentially flawless. It's impossible to connect or relate with Nagisa: she's just too unbelievably perfect. The show wants you to care about her, so they have her be the nicest little angel, but instead this makes her unrealistic and bland. Nagisa's \"struggle\" is to stop being shy, but she hardly even has to try as people are constantly lining up to get closer to her. As for the other characters, there is once again a drastic divide: characters like Akio and Ushio are absolutely stellar: some of the best father and child characters I've ever seen, but others such as Fuko, Kyo and her sister, Sunohara and most of the other side characters hog enormous amounts of screentime and are essentially bland archetypes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nClannad made me cry. By the end of the first season I was openly mocking it, but by the end of the second I was most certainly in tears. It isn't often that a show can do that. It's extremely rare, actually; Clannad is one of three shows to date I have actually shed a tear over. If a show can make me cry, I will enjoy it. In addition this, Clannad is oftentimes seriously funny. It has some solid jokes that really help the story to flow along and to keep you engaged. It's humor always came at just the right times and it was original enough that it kept me laughing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is a rating for the series as the whole. If I were to break it down by season, I would give the first season a 4/10 and the second season a 9/10. I don't really think it's fair to judge Afterstory on its own merits though, since watching the first season is essentially a requirement to get much out of it and therefore is part of the package. I definitely enjoyed the show: I would recommend it to anyone with a taste for drama or slice-of life, and if you are looking for something that will make you emotional this is pretty much the only show I could tell you to watch. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I want to look at what frustrates me most about Clannad and its Afterstory.\\n\r\nIt could have been a LOT better, and it could've been so with relative ease.\\n\\n\r\nThe first and most uncontested move would be to change that damn second ending. Switch it with the first one, replace it with something gentler, I don't care. It's got to go.\\n\\n\r\nThe second move would be to better explain the show's ending. Though it does make sense upon thought, the way it is initially presented is unnecessarily convoluted and confusing and seriously detracts from the experience. I watched my roommate finish the show, and the first thing he said was \"I get what just happened, but HOW did it just happen?\" This shouldn't be the case.\\n\\n\r\nThe third and slightly more difficult move would be to fix Nagisa's character. Whilst there are plenty of one-dimensional side characters, these are a lot easier to ignore if they are not being focused on as much. Nagisa, however, is an essential part of the story and in order for it to really work to its full potential should be a lot more human. There's no need to stick to the VN here because this ISN'T a visual novel, it's an anime, and it fundamentally operates differently. Giving Nagisa some complexity would do wonders for the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe fourth and most relieving move would be to modify the art style. This is no longer a visual novel, you are trying to bring these people to life, so give them human features and have them move like people. The kids are pretty solid: Fuko and Ushio work, with the big girly-doe-eyes fitting their childish characters, and the animation for them far more active than the other characters. All the other characters though, especially the females, need to be redesigned. It's not a crime if it works better, remember, this is an adaptation not a photocopy.\\n\\n\r\nThe fifth and most drastic move would be to fix the shows pacing. The first season of the show essentially relies on the second season in order to have any merit. As a stand-alone, it is a pretty weak show. This shouldn't be the case; a show's sequel should excite you not because it justifies it but because you enjoyed the first show enough to want more. There's no reason why \"Clannad\" can't be a perfectly fabulous high-school rom com with elements of foreshadowing in it, or at least one that's relatively compelling. This would increase the attachment to the story so that you go into Afterstory already caring, and it would do wonders for both Tomoya and Nagisa if the first season centered more around their relationship instead of building up Tomoya's harem in order to later dissolve it. We don't NEED to get snippets of backstory from all the characters in the visual novel because this isn't their story. It's Tomoya and Nagisa's story, so we should be focusing on developing them. Again, this ISN'T a visual novel anymore, and attempting to cram multiple timelines into one is only going to result in a disjointed story and an unfocused narrative. \\n\\n\r\nThe show's major focus is family, so why not start with focusing on that? Though already present, a far more intense focus in the first season on Nagisa's family and setting up Tomoya's backstory would be extremely effective. The steady integration of Tomoya into the family's presence, more development for Sanae and showing the strengthening relationship between Tomoya, and Nagisa's parents, as well as with her. At the same time, contrast it with the tragically decaying nature of Tomoya's own family. Make Nagisa more self-involved with the drama club. She really wants to do this play. She's even selfish about it, willing to coerce or pressure people into joining in order to get what she wants, rather than having Tomoya do everything for her. Instead of waiting until the second season to make an impact, start now! \\n\\n\r\nWhilst Clannad possesses sections of absolute superiority, its tendency to sabotage itself and to put little effort into the parts it knows aren't going to be emotionally impacting seriously detracts from the series. It feels too much like a carbon-copy of the visual novel crammed into the form of something you can watch, and not enough effort was put into the actual adaptation process. In order to adapt from one medium to another, you have to be willing to make creative changes, modify the content and look at what you've created and ask yourself not \"is this similar to the original\" but instead \"is this the best I can do with this?\"",

From a high school student to a full grown adult with every day problems and once in a hundred lifetimes problems,thats what makes this anime unique. It literally made me cry, it literally made me happy, seeing such a heart moving story.\r\nIt showed me what are the most important things in life and that you should not lose track of them.\r\nWhen you watch the episodes you can't help but notice the artwork ,the characters and most important the story. It slapped the face of everyone that thought:\"what the hell being an adult isn't such a big deal after all\".\\n\r\nAnother thing that makes it enjoyable are the hilarious scenes, though frequent and unchanging they will never cease to be amusing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI sincerely hope everyone that watches this anime will enjoy it and learn something good from it as I did.",

            "content": "Clannad and its sequel are my first anime. As a new anime watcher, I felt a lot about the first season (especially Fuuko, not Kotomi though) as well as Kyou and Tomoyo arcs. However, now the emotion they brought to me has faded. However, the second season is simply the most emotional story (anime, movie, novel, etc) I've ever seen. \r\nTo say this series is perfect is not accurate. Actually you can easily find that most reviewers are complaining about the ED and first 8 episodes. Well, the ED is a big issue. But the first 8 episodes are not that off topic, as theycontribute to character development and interactions between people. I think they just pushed it too far. \\n\\n\r\nOr, you can think it this way: subtracting the first 8 episodes you only get about 14 episodes left (9-22), and they managed to get so many people's heart with only these (supported by 1st season). Isn't this a proof how great these episodes are? \\n\\n\r\nPersonally I complain for some other things, like some music choices in episodes like 17. For those who have seen the show, you may know what I mean. Well, I'd like to think myself a rather serious watcher, so I think the comic elements in the show should be reduced. \\n\\n\r\nBesides, I think the whole world setting is not very well integrated into the story. By itself it's very good, but now it seems that the show should end at episode 18. The only noticeable loss would be the song in episode 22. I almost emotionally collapsed when I was watching it, and this song remains as my favorite. \\n\\n\r\nThe whole story about Clannad can be understood through various ways: family, friends, parents, people's growth, etc. It reaches far beyond ordinary high school life. It's also multifaceted in another sense: it has many, many types of tearjerkers. Personally I'm immune to some of them, but not to others. It's hard to be immune to everyone of them. \\n\\n\r\nAlso the character development is very good. I felt I almost grew up with the main character. Sometimes he plainly said exactly how I felt. \\n\\n\r\nThis show is also closely related to reality, except the world setting. I know  how hard it is to create a show which feels so real. Clannad AS has reasons to be the best-received romance&drama series. \\n\\n\r\nOne last point, the artwork is just masterpiece, even it was made in 2008. Other shows may have more stunning backgrounds like 5 cm/s, but Clannad truly excels in depiction of human expressions. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is great as well. Unfortunately, as KyoAni chose to stick to original sound track, the music choice feels limited. Besides, only a small portion of songs in OST were composed for After Story, so it feels further limited. At least they should have some alternatives (with similar tune, like the two versions of Tide). \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say that Clannad AS is not without its defects, but the emotional impact it brings is so strong and sincere that it deserves a 10.",

I don't think I've ever felt such an attachment to characters like I have with Clannad, mostly because there's a fair amount of focus on all of the main ones.\r\nArt: Art is outstanding. It has that typical BIG ANIME EYES that probably became a stereotype of anime for people who know nothing about it... And that's okay because there's nothing at all that's bad about Clannad's art. They used their style in the best possible way. It also just made all of the characters so much more adorable.\r\nSound: Voice acting was great, there were some seriously emotionalmoments that were only amplified because of the voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The amount of character development in this series is definitely another thing that makes Clannad one of the very best anime today - or at least, perhaps the best of its genre. My only negative here is that I wish Sunohara was treated a bit more seriously.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Not once did I find myself getting bored or thinking I should switch to another anime.

            "content": "Never has an anime touched me so deep in so many ways as Clannad: After Story!\r\nThis is my first review so I hope that it can be helpful to as many of you as possible. I will also keep it spoiler free for the people which have yet to discover this gem! \r\nStory - 9 \r\nThe story... WoW, this is going to be hard. Only once has an anime related to my life as much as this (Welcome to the NHK! another great anime). If you watched the first season (which I hope you did) the story continues from where it left off, in aheart warming setting. The MC continues to spend his time as a teen in school with his new girlfriend and the rest of the gang. This part is very similar to the first series as the group carries on with their shenanigans whilst overcoming many internal struggles that shape each of the characters more. Now the second part of the season when it gets really interesting, because throughout the many different anime's that I have watched rarely have I stumbled upon one that would carry on the story after the MC graduates and has to start living in the real world. For me a 19 year old at the time which finished his life in education and started working full time it was a hard time... still is and that's what bonded me with the MC. The story focuses on the hardships of growing up, on family relations something that everyone has to deal with LIFE. There are some situations in the story that are a bit dumb, where somethings could be easily avoided if not for the stupid decisions of the main cast. However the story really grips you and will make you binge watch it as you will be anxious to see what happens next. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 9 \\n\\n\r\nNow the art in my opinion looks better than the first season as it is crisper. The main traits of Clannad are still very visible such as the huge eyes which in my opinion are great as they really suit this type of anime. The characters are all a bit similar on the face, if you were to take away their hair and eyes they would probably be identical (mainly the girls). The environment is really pretty and sets the mood in some situations it was really astounding but not all the way through. There was very little CGI which I am grateful for as for this type of anime its just not right. The main CGI abuser was the tin robot which could have been animated in my opinion but maybe the producers wanted him to stand out more. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9 \\n\\n\r\nSound in this anime is great! It gives the scenes so much more impact and really gives you the feels. I really liked the intro a lot more than the first one. It was perfect for Clannad. However I would have given sound a 10 but had to drop it to a 9 as the bloody ending ruined it all. The ending in itself is not bad but why would you put such a lighthearted and cheery song here just why? Every time that something emotional would happen it would be ruined by the sudden ending. It really killed the vibe, especially because the ending for the first season Dango Daikazoku was AMAZING! Luckily we get to hear it a lot as the back ground sound and it is also sung by the main characters, but man does hearing it make my eyes water. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10 \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are all written very well and I can confidently say that you will relate to at least one of them as there is quite a roster. However unlike first season a lot of the focus is on the MC and his Girlfriend (I said no spoilers so I'm not going to mention names) as well as their families. The other characters are not seen as frequently as before but as we did manage to develop some relations with them they don't feel shallow. Their screen time is also used well which makes up for not seeing them as much. The MC goes through some deep development and honestly I love it. There are things that he does that we would never expect and he would probably never expect either. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10 \\n\\n\r\nI don't know if crying like a 12 year old girl on her period could be categorised as enjoyment. Simply put even though it was an emotional roller coaster (never expected to say that) I enjoyed every minute of it. I think that me watching it in one sitting would back that up. I didn't want to stop watching I wanted to know whats going to happen next, I NEEDED to know. There were moments when I laughed out loud so there is some banta here as well. I would gladly re watch it and I'm sure that I would enjoy it as much as I did the first time. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10 \\n\\n\r\nNow I am giving this a 10 because I cannot in my heart give it any less than that. However there are some small bits here and there that could be improved upon (one being give us more). The story really gripped me and there was a bit of foreshadowing so there was somethings which you could expect to happen but there was still a lot of surprises on the way. The art was not my absolute favourite but it is unique and I respect the creators for that. The sound was awesome and I never expected a song to make me cry. Just change the ending as its a vibe killer. Characters are really great, I have such a hard time picking best girl its crazy and unlike many anime's involving one guy and a group of girls the MC was really good, he had his own struggles which helped his development giving him a real life feel. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall if you have not watched it yet please do, I promise you wont regret it. Its a must see for people that watched the first season. I regret keeping it on my to watch list for so long. \\n\\n\r\nIt took some courage and time to write this review so I hope that it could be of some help. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoy the After Story!\\n",

            "content": "Once upon a time, Tomoya Okazaki had been depressed.  The child of a single, alcoholic parent and a delinquent at school, there was nothing in the world for him to live for, and he knew it.  That was before he met Nagisa Furukawa, a sweet, docile, anemic girl with a dream to live and no strength or will to see it through.  With the help of a strange bevy of friends and romantic options, Tomoya was able to guide the girl through the hard times that came her way, pulling her over every obstacle and believing in her until that dream couldbe realized...  And once it was over, she had practically no choice but to pay him back by becoming his girlfriend.\\n\\n\r\nIn most anime, that\u2019s where the story would end, but here, it\u2019s not so simple...  Their relationship is only the beginning of a winding tale of fate that will affect the boundaries of reality itself.  As they leave behind high school...  Along with their friends, Tomoya\u2019s need to help people, and the hearts of half a dozen other girls...  And embark on their journey into adulthood and the real world.  This means taking a bold, courageous leap into independence, responsibility, and consequences as they get jobs and learn to support each other.  They\u2019re warned that there\u2019s going to be trouble along the way, but nobody could possibly guess just how much heartbreak and tragedy is awaiting them...  Because surviving high school and becoming a couple may be the beginning, even marital bliss is far from the ending.\\n\\n\r\nLike it\u2019s predecessor, Clannad Afterstory was produced by famed studio Kyoto Animation, the crown kings of the moe art style(A1 is the queen)...  And yet it doesn\u2019t look quite the same.  The over-all style of Kyoto Animation is well known to have changed drastically in the mid to late 2000s, and a lot of people blame the financial success of K-On! for this shift...  Their artwork used to be very solid and consistent even at it\u2019s most active moments, but following this change, faster on-screen motion looks a lot cheaper, as though they found a more affordable method of capturing motion without sacrificing speed or energy...  But it\u2019s unfortunately highly noticeable, and it doesn\u2019t look nearly as impressive as their work from the first half of the decade.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, it started to look Gainax-y.  Honestly, though, I don\u2019t really think K-on! is to blame for this.  Clannad Afterstory is their earliest work where I actually noticed this change, although it looks more prototypical compared to K-on.  I mentioned in my last review how the artists were able to create life in the eyes of their female characters, and while their eyes don\u2019t look quite as dead as I implied a drop in the budget would make them, they do still have their iffier moments.  This can make faster fluid movements can appear choppy or cheap looking at times...  It\u2019s probably at it\u2019s worst when Akio is moving his arms to rap...  But thankfully, after the first eight episodes, bigger actions are few and far between, leaving a decent amount of money available for the rare CG effects and some of the better moments towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe music really hasn\u2019t changed since my last review, so there isn\u2019t a whole lot I can say about it.  Instead, I\u2019ll talk about the opening and ending, both of which are apparently beloved.  Despite the show\u2019s step down in animation quality, the opening looks a LOT better in Afterstory, despite their similarities.  The song is Toki wo Kizamu Uta by Key veteran Lia, it not only sounds but also looks far more interesting than the generic, snooze worthy track that opened it\u2019s predecessor.  This opening begins rapturously, showcasing the supernatural lights and shots of the town on a far more visually arresting note.  One thing I found odd is that even though the series has left behind it\u2019s harem-y roots, it still announces the game\u2019s romantic options in the opening.  They had the good sense to get rid of Fuko, but that still leaves Kotomi, Tomoyo and Kyou, who\u2019ve all been largely downgraded to supporting roles in what\u2019s supposed to be Tomoya and Nagisa\u2019s story.\\n\\n\r\nThe english dub has also greatly improved, with Steven Foster taking less and less of a role in the show before moving on from it completely.  Clint Bickham is a decent writer who\u2019s very good at transforming Japanese idioms and turn of phrase into something more accessible to Western viewers without bastardizing it.  Janice Williams takes over directorial duties, and while Foster was a producer on the dub, it was short-lived.  The acting is just as strong as it was in the previous show, despite a few tweaks here and there.  David Matranga is still carrying the series, and Luci Christian is still sweet and supportive.  She gets more opportunities at range, but said opportunities are limited...  She alters her approach hilariously when Nagisa gets drunk, and her vocal work during childbirth(Yeah, i\u2019ll be spoiling that here) are heartbreaking.\\n\\n\r\nShe plays her won child, which would be a great opportunity to show more of her abilities, if her child wasn\u2019t as bland and artificial as pepperoni pizza.  Illich Gaurdiola returns as Yusuke Yoshino, who is now Tomoya\u2019s sempai at work, and while I enjoy him during his weirder moments...  Take the glorious baseball game for example...  The rest of his performance just sounds like one-note mumbling.  The pitch sounds right for the sort of character he\u2019s playing, but he sounds like he doesn\u2019t want to be in the booth, and is just getting his lines out as quickly as possible so he can go home.  I didn\u2019t mention this in the last season\u2019s review(although it applies there too), but Andrew Love and Kara Greenburg are the undisputed stars of the dub as Nagisa\u2019s parents, Akio and Sanae.  Both characters are almost bipolar in nature, showing vastly different attitudes whether they\u2019re acting calm and quiet or crazy and over-the-top, but either way, they\u2019re a joy to listen to.  It probably helps that they\u2019re playing the best characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I should probably begin by saying that yes, Clannad Afterstory is better than Clannad, to the point where I wish they\u2019d reversed the names and called the first one Clannad: Beforestory.  Because let\u2019s be honest, the first season didn\u2019t have much of a story...  It featured a collection of small stories that were as interchangeable as the girls Tomoya was helping.  The whole thing climaxed with a love confession, and while that may have been believable when you consider Tomoya\u2019s self-worth issues, it doesn\u2019t put up much of an argument for compelling stakes.  Afterstory, on the other hand, drops the disjointed nature of the series and decides instead to buckle down and tell a solid, extensive story...  Nine episodes in.  Yeah, apparently there were still a few mini-arcs to get through, and I\u2019ll be honest, they\u2019re a chore.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode, which revolves around the entire cast being reunited for a baseball game, is awesome, even if the plot may have been lifted from Haruhi Suzumiya.  There\u2019s some great comedy in this episode, and it does an admirable job of reintroducing the last season\u2019s characters to the audience, as well as establishing where Tomoya and Nagisa are in their relationship.  The next two episodes quickly go downhill as Mei comes back to town to check on Sunohara, and these are some miserable damn episodes.  Not only are they stupid and entirely pointless, but they take the somewhat unlikeable Sunohara and turn him into what can only be described as a reprehensibly selfish creature.  I\u2019ll spare you A LOT of the details, but ultimately, Tomoya pretends to be Mei\u2019s boyfriend to try to piss Sunohara off.  He doesn\u2019t, and later on, he reveals that even though they blatantly claimed to be sleeping together, he didn\u2019t try to stop it \u201cBecause it was you, Okazaki!\u201d  Yeah, if you\u2019re gonna trust a pedophile with your 12 year old sister\u2019s virginity, it had better be Okazaki.\\n\\n\r\nThe following arc isn\u2019t as bad, per se, but equally pointless, and deeply unintentionally funny.  The woman who runs the dorm...  Whom in any other show would be too unimportant to have a story arc, but this is Clannad and filler is it\u2019s art form...  And how a boy she fell in love with turned out to be a ghost, but she made a wish to turn him into her immortal pet cat.  Yeah, just imagine the implications as she cleans out her one true love\u2019s litter box.  Then we get an arc for the quiet girl in the library who occasionally helps them with their problems, and while it\u2019s probably the best of the three arcs, it\u2019s still entirely lacking in purpose.  As I said before, you could easily skip all of these episodes without losing anything in translation...  But whether you watch it or not, that won\u2019t change the fact that immediately afterwards, something amazing happens...  Clannad finally begins to feel like a real story.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re counting the first season, plus OVAs, this is around episode 34, and the main character finally begins to develop.  You heard me right.  No longer does he just exist to surround himself with broken people, help fix them and occasionally give us something to feel sorry for him about, oh no...  He grows, faces some real flaws, and learns some actual lessons.  He moves out and into his own apartment, supports Nagisa while she repeats her final year of school, and gets a job, actually having to learn his new trade from the ground up.  He\u2019s living with Nagisa all the while, pops the question to her, and goes through one of my favorite episodes as he tries to get her father\u2019s permission to make the engagement official.  It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s clearly the best kind of writing the series has to offer.  Which is a shame, because it all comes crashing down due to her pregnancy.\\n\\n\r\nWell, let\u2019s back it up a bit.  Tomoya would be a great character in an anime where the rest of the characters were even close to having as much depth as him.  The way it is, with Tomoya having this tragic past, all of this emotional damage, and an entire cast of other characters hanging on his every word constantly reminding him(and us) how great he is, he honestly just feels Mary-Suish on an almost masturbatory level.  He gets an idealized wife, because that\u2019s all that\u2019s left of Nagisa after her play is over, leaving her as a straight up anti-character.  Their marriage feels like a couple of kids playing house, which might be because they sleep in different beds and NEVER KISS.  The moment when she announces her pregnancy(in the most infantile way possible) is probably the most shocking moment in the whole series.  She gives birth, and their daughter is the perfectly idealized well-behaved child who will stay home alone and not get any trouble while her sole caregiver goes through a full-time workday.  I mean, sure, she goes for walks on her own, but that\u2019s never addressed as a horribly irresponsible thing for Tomoya to allow.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of Ushio, let\u2019s get to the one spoiler I have to talk about(It\u2019s not the only one, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll avoid the others);  Nagisa dies during childbirth, an act I\u2019m pretty sure she was written purely for.  When this happens, Tomoya spirals into depression, and hands his daughter off to her grandparents...  Which we learn after a five year time skip.  This is where my appreciation of Tomoya as a character comes crashing down like a plane with a teddy bear on it.  Yes, I know it hurts to lose someone, but wallowing in self pity for five years?  I once saw a movie where Kevin James failed to file some important financial paperwork for a year after his wife\u2019s death, and I called bullshit on that, too.  If you have children, you have a responsibility to those children, and if you fail to even attempt to live up to that responsibility, I have no sympathy for you.\\n\\n\r\nWhich would be fine, if he were portrayed in an unsympathetic light from then on.  I don\u2019t mind horrible people in a story, as long as they\u2019re recognized as being horrible.  But the very idea that after five years, Akio never once stormed into Tomoya\u2019s apartment to kick the crap out of his selfish ass is completely out of character for him.  Even his daughter, after a bonding trip that\u2019s full of more coincidences than the movie Rat Race, has no problem moving from her big house over the bakery into a smaller apartment to be with her stranger-daddy, even after undoubtedly forming parental bonds with her doting grandparents.  Everyone treats poor Tomoya with an \u201cOh, you must have had it tough\u201d slap on the back when he deserved a kick in the nuts, which destroyed his very real chances of earning my sympathy.\\n\\n\r\nSo what does this all lead up to?  Well, harkening back to my last review, that depends.  To half the viewers, it leads to one of the most heartbreaking and then uplifting tragedies of the anime medium.  To the other half, it leads to emotionally manipulative tripe that barely deserves to lick their feet.  I can\u2019t really speak to which of these opinions is right...  Oh wait, yes I can, because this is my review.  The ending of Afterstory is terrible.  We get a second tragedy, which I won\u2019t spoil, and while it\u2019s perfectly set up by the internal logic of the series, the punch is soon pulled by a sudden happy ending that\u2019s so cheap, even people who explicitly understand the dream world logic call bullshit on it.  Not only does it directly undermine the much-adored dark, tragic tones that everyone likes to sell it on, but it backtracks on some of the most important development that Tomoya went through in a way that can easily be compared to the Prince of Persia movie.  Yeah, try washing THAT analogy out of your mouth.\\n\\n\r\nClannad Afterstory is available from Sentai Filmworks.  Much like the first season, it\u2019s available in both DVD and Bluray formats, for between the prices of forty-five and sixty dollars.  Each season comes with OVA episodes, and there are three of them in this one...  A story that allegedly takes place right before the beginning of season 1, and two episodes dedicated to the Kyou and Ryou story arc.  There are also undubbed DVDs that are somewhat cheaper.  Several manga and live action spin-offs have been created, but none of them are officially available in the States, although there\u2019s a petition to translate and import the first visual novel.  \\n\\n\r\nEarlier, I said that Afterstory was better than the original Clannad, a statement I still stand by.  What I probably should have specified is that better does not equal good, and in this case, it\u2019s more a drop in the bucket than a noticeable mark in quality. Really, it was only able to pull itself above it\u2019s predecessor by dropping the harem elements and developing it;s main character, both of which it did way too late, and not very well.  A good rule of thumb to keep in mind while writing a tragedy is that you can\u2019t make the audience like a character just by having bad things happen to them.  Rather, write them to be interesting beforehand, so that we get to like them before those things happen.  The only character we get to know on an intimate level is Tomoya, and we get to know everybody else through their relationships to him...  Thus, when somebody dies, we don\u2019t feel as though WE\u2019VE lost someone important, but instead we\u2019re expected to feel it through him.  Nobody else gets a lover, or an interesting job, or anything else in the future, just Tomoya, and while he\u2019s a good character by Clannad\u2019s low standards, he\u2019s just not good enough to get THAT invested in.  I give Clannad Afterstory a 4/10.",

            "content": "I decided I would write a review for Clannad after I watched it on DVD. I bought this series and let me say that its worth it, anyone who says otherwise is selling something. The high quality, the good subs and the ability to watch it on a big screen. Watching this series on a big screen is a whole lot more better that actually watching it with headphones on my computer in uncomfortable chair. It makes you feel like you got front row seats and you feel more into the story. \r\nThis Anime is golden, Jun Maeda is amazing to create such a masterpiece.Maeda has a great way of telling tragedy's in life and most importantly on \u201chow to live\u201d and emphasizing on family's. Like in the series \u201cAngel Beats\u201d Its overall theme of how great it is to be alive. That really comes out in the Girls Dead Monster songs:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWhen I rose up, the vast world felt so much smaller\\n\r\n...So recklessly I thought that climbing higher would be even better\\n\r\nIt\u2019s as if everyone is looking up; What do you think?\\n\r\nI\u2019m glad to be alive; When I can have such thoughts\\n\r\nIt feels the best\\n\r\nEven when I\u2019m crying in tatters; Even when I struggle to yell out\\n\r\nWe can walk forward again\\n\r\nGood-bye and Thank you\u201d - Highest Life \u2013 Girls Dead Monster\\n\\n\r\nI would never really say that Clannad is better than the other works of Key because they are all different in their own way. I can't say that one is better than the other because I love them all.\\n\\n\r\nmild spoilers\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10. I'm not really sure how to explain how much I love the story in words because its just too hard. The series starts out in Ibuki Fuko's arc. Which goes from episode 2 to 9. This arc out of the first season is the one that made me cry the most. It is really deep and sad. it shows someone that is loved being slowly forgotten by everyone. Next the story goes to Ichinose Kotomi's arc which lasts from 10 to 14. Kotomi's arc has a lot of character development and has a lot of great quotes. It shows how one girls was left alone when she was little and now she is being saved from being alone by her friends. This arc show how great it is to have friends and how they can help you overcome trials in your life. Following Kotomi's arc is A short Sunohara arc then the short Tomoyo arc 15-18. These are great episodes arc that keep the series progressing further. After we finally get to Nagisa arc part 1. This arc is a great closer to the first season.  It tells of Nagisa's hidden past and the play that the drama club preforms. 19-22\\n\\n\r\nWe move on to After Story: where we start out in Sunohara arc. 1-4. This a great arc to start out the second season. You start to resent Sunohara a bit but its cleared up near the end. Next is Misae's arc...? You mean the boys dorm manager? Yes lol This arc really surprised me tho, I never thought that she would get a arc. This arc has a lot of good quotes by favorite from it is: \u201cLove is like a firework from the past\u2026 it\u2019s more beautiful for it to go to pieces and scatter far off.\u201d - Shima. Following Misae's arc is Yukine's arc. Which tell of how two gangs are fighting and one girl tries to stop it. Episode 9-22 begins the final Ushio arc or as I call it the Okazaki family arc. This arc is the great arc in the history of mankind. It tells of nagisa and tomoya's life after school is over. Its very deep and just the greatest. I don't know how to explain it anymore. This arc made me want to write this review. You have to see it to believe it.\\n\\n\r\nArt N/A: I don't usually rate art, because It's not a factor for me when I watch a series.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9: Here's where again Jun Maeda shows his strength. The music fits so amazing with everything that happens in the series. The great openings give a great overall feel to the series and they fit perfectly. But...the ending themes are a different story. The first ending for Clannad was amazing but the ending for after story should have been a ballad or Dango Daikazoku. It feels wrong and ruins the mood when you get to the episode 15 and higher.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10: There's so much character development in this series and great storytelling. To Fuko's starfish state to Sunohara's comic relief and from Nagisa's quiet self to Kyo's dictionary throwing. \\n\r\nEach character has their own personalty and they come together to make Clannad the masterpiece it is.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10+,  If you want a great series that will deeply impact your life and move you to tear choose this. It has happy moments, funny moments, moments where you just want to bawl and moments that make the series into the greatest masterpiece ever created.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who love this show buy the DVD's and support Key. You wont be disappointed and you will love watching this series on a bigger screen with no headphones or distractions. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cA child dreams is their parent's dreams! So you grant it for us! We've been dreaming of the day you'd make your dream come true! We changed our dreams to your dream!! That's what parents are! That's what's Family is!\u201d - Akio Furukawa",

            "content": "Ah! Clannad After Story. I doubt any fansub anime viewer is unfamiliar with this since it is flagship title of the Winter 2008 to Spring 2009 season. Now let's get down to the review.\r\nLike the other Jun Maeda (Air, Clannad) stories I expected it to reach its zenith at around 1/2 to 3/4 way through. The first half of the series will not stand out too much simply because it is simply Key's style. Put simply. It's  the second half of the 1st season. There's comedy, some drama, a tiny bit of romance, and a straightforward story. The first half pretty much is theso-so appetizer. Even though Clannad After Story will not be remembered for its comedy there are comedy gold scenes that will make anyone lol. Btw. I will not recommend watching this if the viewer has not seen the 1st season.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half is where it shines. Heavy drama at it's best is Kyoani's forte which they haven't perfected after Air was released. I'm not going to expound on this part since I know that you know as well as myanimelist.net knows that this is already an all time classic.\\n\\n\r\nHigh production is evident in Clannad After Story like most other Kyoani works. The mood, the buildings; scenes; character designs are all good. Attention to detail is allocated to important scenes which is how it is and how it should be.\\n\\n\r\nFor this anime, the sound is the better-half of the art. Songs that are otherwise recycled are used for maximum effect. I was surprised that Jun Maeda also wrote the songs for this one. No wonder they fit so perfectly with what he's trying to convey. However, they didn't put a lot of effort in fixing replacing the ED song every time there's a dramatic end. The happy feel of the ED ruins the mood.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one anime that I would recommend this season it has to be Clannad After Story. Animes like these don't come along often.\\n\\n",

Ill also try and make it as spoiler free as possible.\r\n~Story~\r\nTaking place exactly after the event in the first season clannad picks up where it left off but with a bit of a twist. First off the story follows them after high schools and we can see what they do with therelife. some go to college, others (like Tomoya) go to right to the work force. second Nagisa and Tomoya's relationship is explored from boyfriend/girlfriend to marriage. and finally other events that would spoil the show.\\n\\n\r\n~Art~\\n\\n\r\nThe show really shines in it's art and animation. With the illusionary world, the opening, and some of the events, it's no surprise that this show looks good. \\n\\n\r\n~Sound~\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this show is...amazing. With many of the tracks from the first season coming back and new tracks added, there should be no surprise that this soundtrack is amazing (One of my favorites at that). \\n\\n\r\nAs for the dub.....go for the sub (It's pretty freaking bad)\\n\\n\r\n~Characters~ \\n\\n\r\nBeing that there is only a few new characters coming into the show it's hard to bash on this catagory The old characters return (some leaving later for school or work), and only 1 real character actually comes in during the course of this show. I wont mention who this character is (assuming you havent spoiled yourself in this show yet) but they defiantly play a pretty major role in this show, even when he/she was first mentioned.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~\\n\\n\r\nTo say that this show bored me is a complete LIE!!!! don't be fooled by it's first season, yeah it was good but that was the tip of this emotional rollercoaster of a show. I cannot stress people enough to watch this. Yeah it's not for everyone, but I feel that it is a show people should be watched at least once in there life. I STRONGLY recommend this show to anyone interested.\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing - I challenge you to watch this show in it's entirety (clannad and clannad ~after story~) and not cry during your course of watching or streaming of this show.",

            "content": "[[NOTE: NOT ONLY WILL I BE REVIEWING CLANNAD AFTER STORY, I WILL ALSO REVIEW THE ORIGINAL CLANNAD AS WELL, JUST SO I CAN SAY WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT BOTH SEASONS.]]\r\nEmotions. When it comes to anime or just media in general, it can be quite hard for people to feel emotional when they watch a series. If you have a show that has bad characters and/or a bad story, it would be almost impossible for the person watching to feel any type of emotion. But if a show has amazing characters and/or a wonderful story, it is slightly easier. Now when a show is trying tomake you cry, it needs to nail everything and get everything perfect for the person watching to feel for these characters, so much, that they cry when something happens to them. With that said, before I watched the series I\u2019m about to review, I have only ever cried watching any sort of media 2 times. The first was when I watched the anime, \u201cAngel Beats!\u201d With very likeable characters and a good story, it was the first anime I ever cried to. I only cried once watching Angel Beats. The second was when I watched an Australian-made movie called \u201cRed Dog.\u201d It told the story of a red cattle dog as he lives in the Australian outback. I cried 2 times watching that movie. The one day, after many people telling me to watch the Clannad series, I watched it. And my thoughts of it were this: \u201cThis is the most perfect anime I have ever seen in my entire life.\u201d\\n\\n\r\n(MY REVIEW MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.)\\n\\n\r\n[[Story \u2013 10/10]]\\n\\n\r\nBasically, I thought the story was perfection. Clannad tells the story of two high-school students named Tomoya and Nagisa, as we see their relationship together grow. The way the story goes is basically split into several arcs. Each arc was amazing to watch. Each one had its fair share of ups, downs, twists and turns. And each one went at a very steady pace, if a bit slow. But because the story advanced somewhat slowly, it worked to its advantage. To see the story unfold, it also had meanings to them. Seeing the story unfold will teach you that life is not easy, that you should always protect your friends and family and that your friends and family will always be there for you, no matter what happens. The story can make you feel emotions very easily as well. Not only does it have sad scenes of depression and sadness (An example is something like dealing with family problems, which is something I can relate to), but it can also make you smile and laugh your head off (An example is in one scene, where Tomoya gets locked in a gym storage room with one of the supporting female characters, producing one of the most awkward and funniest scenes I have ever seen in anime.) For the series to be able to make me feel these emotions perfectly is simply astounding. When it came to the original Clannad, it did portray scenes of sadness from time to time, but there was plenty of comedy to even it out. Clannad After Story, on the other hand, has much less comedy then the original Clannad. There was some comedy, but After Story focused more on emotions of sadness. Which isn\u2019t a bad thing. In fact, I think it\u2019s a good thing. Sometimes, when watching something sad, it\u2019s best to not have comedy. With such a well thought-out story, it was a pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\n[[Characters \u2013 10/10]]\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, the characters are also perfect. The main characters, Tomoya and Nagisa, were one of the most interesting, likable and put-together characters I have ever seen. Seeing these two grow and to see their relationship grow was amazing to watch. Tomoya is a very interesting character, who I can kinda relate to. He\u2019s lazy and not very bright (just like me), but he would do anything for his friends. He was also quite a trickster, so he brought a lot of comedy to the show. To see him grow up as a person was brilliant. Nagisa, the main female character, is quite possibly the most likable character ever. She\u2019s a pretty girl who\u2019s very fragile and caring. To also see her grow up as a person was amazing. The supporting characters were fantastic as well. You had Kyou, the tough but caring girl, who bought a lot of comedy to the series, Kotomi, the shy, quiet genius who should never, ever, EVER play a violin, Tomoyo, the girl who could kick your butt without even trying, Fuko, the cute girl who loves starfishes, who I really liked throughout the series and then there is Sunohara, the wacky casanova that has no luck with the ladies. And that\u2019s not even the entire supporting cast. Every single character is extremely likable in some way. And even if you didn\u2019t like all the characters, there is bound to be at least one character you will like. I liked every single character in the entire series, which is kinda amazing to me, because whenever I watch an anime series, there was always this one character I didn\u2019t like. In Clannad, there was no such character. The characters were amazing to watch. Many characters made me laugh, and many characters made me cry.\\n\\n\r\n[[Animation \u2013 10/10]]\\n\\n\r\nIn the animation department, it is also perfect. Now, although it isn\u2019t the best animation I have ever seen in anime (The anime movie Redline, gets that honour), I thought the animation was amazing and beautiful, as expected from Kyoto Animation. The character designs looks fantastic, the backgrounds looks astounding and the anime was colourful and vibrant. And not only that, I liked the art style so much. Although for some, the art style does look a bit weird, I liked it. Wherever the setting was, it was a visual treat for the eyes. It should be noted however, that After Story\u2019s animation looks far better than the original Clannad, which is to be expected. And since the original Clannad\u2019s animation looked amazing in my opinion, then After Story\u2019s animation was astonishing. If you\u2019re looking for a beautiful anime, Clannad and Clannad After Story is the answer.\\n\\n\r\n[[Sound \u2013 10/10]]\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, the sound was perfect as well. First up, the voice acting in the sub was magnificent. The voice-actor\u2019s performance was done perfectly. Each characters voice matched the character so well, and they did such a wonderful job expressing feelings in many moments of the anime. And then there is the music. The music is beyond beautiful. Clannad\u2019s soundtrack has a lot of piano playing, and quiet, almost lullaby-style songs. But it also has songs that can make you feel tense, make you laugh, make you sad and make you smile. The soundtracks and the scenes in which the songs play on those scenes, is done perfectly. When it came to the really emotional moments of the series, the songs really helped you feel emotional. Whenever there was a sad scene, a quiet and sad song play, making the entire scene even sadder. Whenever someone was tricking someone, a funny, upbeat song would play, making the scene that much more funny. The songs perfectly matched the scene it belonged to. The opening and closings of both series were also brilliant. The original\u2019s opening was very nice, but After Story\u2019s opening was beautiful, in both animation and sound. The closing song of the original Clannad, was a song about Dango\u2019s. (A blobby creature Nagisa loved) The closing song of the original Clannad was such a quiet and beautiful song. It was used a fair amount in After Story, and whenever the Dango song was playing, it made me so emotional. After Story\u2019s closing song was very upbeat and funny, so I really liked that as well. The whole Clannad series will make your ears feel like they are in heaven.\\n\\n\r\n[[Enjoyment \u2013 10/10]]\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely loved every minute of the Clannad series. It was such an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish. I just loved everything about it. And no matter how many times I thought about it, no matter how many times I remember all the episodes and all the moments in the series, I just couldn\u2019t find one problem with the entire series. Not one. Well, there is one problem: After you finish the series, you will feel the biggest void you will ever feel in your life. It is quite literally the most perfect anime ever made: a masterpiece. Although it isn\u2019t my all-time favourite anime (Panty and Stocking 4ever!), I think it is the best anime I have ever seen. So watch this series. And love it. Then tell your friends to watch it. Tell everyone you know to watch Clannad. Everyone should watch Clannad. Oh, and one more thing. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re wondering: How many times did I cry watching the whole Clannad series? Well\u2026\\n\\n\r\nI cried 8 times.\\n\\n\r\n[[Final Rating \u2013 10/10]]\\n",

Not only did it fail to meet my expectations, but crushed them and burned it into ashes. I was highly disappointed.\r\nIt was an anime that was meant to be slice of life, romance, drama and sadness.  It was quite boring. Even the comedy is stale. Yes the Art is nice, yes the music's good but the characters, the story line was so plain. The only characters I liked were Kyo, Tomoyo and Kotomi. The opening was also bad: I didn't enjoy it. There was so manyfillers, I thought it was pretty lame. I wanted more of a depressing, romantic anime which could've made me cry but the story was bad and I couldn't understand it, including the ending so therefore, 2/10.",

            "content": "An Entangled web of emotions and details that will blow your mind...\r\nI'm sure you've heard of Clannad After Story...\r\nI'm sure you've heard about its reputation as an Emotional series...\r\nI'm sure you've heard about the sheer popularity of the Clannad series...\r\nAnd for all of this, there are a multitude of reasons... \r\nIn a nutshell, After Story brings about a revolutionary, mind blowing level of depth, emotion, immersion, to an extent that is indescribable by words - though i will try my best. After Story is a CRITICAL watch for viewers of the original series, and it is the powerhouse of a season that MAKES Clannad oneof THE most reputable anime of all time.\\n\\n\r\nAs a standalone, neither of these seasons would hold anywhere near the amount of sway that Clannad as a series, as a brand - has on the anime community. Linking this Key anime series into one beautiful story creates something magical... So what exactly?\\n\\n\r\nAfter Story for me came across as one of the most well thought out shows that I've seen in absolutely every aspect. \\n\r\nIts execution is delicate and attentive throughout, and this immaculate attention to detail allows the show to make some of the most far fetched, obscure links imaginable that will not only have you crawling around for explanations, but make you feel a completely unique sense of sentimentality.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to its bolder techniques... I speculate that in terms of \"AS\", the first season is merely a setup to it - by taking the time to run the viewers through each character in great depth (and pretty equally) in the first season, AS begins with an immediate attachment to the viewer, and uses this emotional fragility to make heavy-hitting events.\\n\\n\r\nAS is manipulative in the way it uses a technique i'm going to refer to as \"The Wall\" - It can build up the viewers' attachment and feelings to the characters and premise in one way, and then do something completely left field to shatter it: therefore leaving huge impact craters, and coming across as such a moving show.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, no production can be proved to make a good show, but the closest measurement conceivable would be that of the impact that it has on the viewer, and if you've read just above, you might have guessed that Clannad is for these reasons (in my opinion) a masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nThis relentless combination of attachment, impact and meaningful, sentimental values and details (that are sometimes left deliberately unclear for subconscious impact) truly spark thoughts in the viewer, allowing them to be engulfed by the show's ethos, and therefore rendering Clannad to be not only a legendary anime, but an outlook on life.\\n\\n\r\nIt may surprise readers, but After story is not only a omnipotent conveyor of vivid emotions, and immersive emotional friction, but in terms of presentation: that too is on par with the same goals - of taking the viewer on the most meaningful, powerful roller-coaster journey conceivable.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of ART, it fluctuates at times between different styles of drawing and vibrancy levels to accommodate the scene. It's generally very colourful and detailed , and so there's nothing that could have made it more effective...\\n\\n\r\nThe SOUND of Clannad as a whole (as it doesn't change much) is one of the best examples of sentimentality, and as you would (as a viewer) come to see, Clannad is able to imbue some formidable power into a small range of songs (primarily one consisting of little marshmallow-like people with eyes ;) ) These songs are continuously embedded at certain points as additional emotion-inducing devices.\\n\r\nIn layman's terms: very fitting...\\n\\n\r\nThe CHARACTER development of AF is good, though heavily oriented towards Nagisa and Tomoyo (as the main characters) - while the rest remain themselves. A small selection of characters are added, but while Character Development was the strong suit of the original season, AF is much more event-based, and so this isn't its specialty.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT?!\\n\r\nAfter Story sent me on THE most powerful emotional journey that an anime has ever taken me on before, and so while \"enjoy\" is by no means the right word here, but in a sense that i'm glad i watched it, i definitely enjoyed both seasons.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, due to its sheer power and mind-boggling vividness, i give AF a 10; as i will always remember it for being a masterpiece - Though, i am aware that this delicate approach to anime doesn't appeal to everyone.\\n",

            "content": "10/10, no doubt about it.\r\nGeneralities and Formalities.\r\nClannad: After story, is commonly referred to as one of the greatest animes to be ever written and created. It's up at the top with Steins;Gate and FMA, and all for a good reason. But before I get into these reasons, I have to point out the fact that Clannad: AS is the only Slice of Life anime to be in the top 5, and this is an impressive feat that gets overlooked. In a society of Anime dominated with the overwhelming fanbase of Shounen anime (action, fighting etc...), a Slice of Life anime able to break through thatcraze and emerge at the top. Personally, it is my number one anime out of all the animes I have watched. The reasons I will reach now.\\n\\n\r\nStory. 10/10\\n\r\nKey, the writers of Angel Beats!, Little Busters (Refrain), Kanon, Clannad, and Air are known for their genius in writing amazing stories. They have become so famous to the point where Key has it's own anime genre (fan addressed) called \"Key Anime\" which refers to these slice of life animes which have a mind blowing, or completely heartbreaking/joyous ending. \\n\r\nNow, getting to Clannad: AS. The story takes place after the original Clannad Television series, but instead follows mainly about life after highschool. The other factor which makes this show even more enjoyable and touching is the fact that the story and characters are so real. After Story does what Clannad (Original) could not do, and that is wrap up things and answer questions.\\n\r\nOf course I cannot say too much or it would ruin the story, but the first season's setup led perfectly into this second season, which developed the story into something truly beautiful, and will treasure in their hearts. I shit you not, I changed how I looked at life because of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Art:\\n\r\nObviously not the most beautiful characters out there in the Anime Industry, whether it comes to OPPAI!!! (Highschool DxD) or design (Nagi no Asukara), but the art style to Key animes are very unique. After Story is no different. The characters are perfect for the story, and could not imagine it with any other art for the characters. The eyes especially display the sadness and happiness of a character extremely effeciently!\\n\\n\r\nScenery:\\n\r\nThis anime was made quite a long time ago (2008-9). That was 5-6 years ago, yet, the artwork was consistently fantastic for the scenery. I will quickly and spoiler free mention examples. The snow, grass fields, everything to that sort, all were amazing. even surpassing some of the animes we have to this date.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe music, was perfect for every situation. To this day, whenever I watch the opening for this show, I get chills and a wave of reminescence hits me like a hammer. Every single character has their own theme song, which plays continuously and fits them amazingly. The OST for the situations that the anime plays through also fit amazingly, and I am not exaggerating when I say that the music becomes a part of the story telling. Now, to the sound effects. These are standard, and for a bigger company like Key is unexpected, and of course, they do not mess it up. Every sound effect from baseball noises to eating, to plates, rain, cicadas, walking, are all great. The voice acting? Amazing. They used famous actors from all over the industry. We have people from one piece, fairy tail, highschool dxd, you get it, basically the best out there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters. 10/10\\n\r\nIn an anime based around story telling, what's a good story without a good set of characters? The characters are all very different, and yet they work very well together as a group. briefly, I will go over the characters and their characteristics.\\n\r\nOkazaki Tomoya - A delinquent, yet a very caring guy in the inside. He likes to take care of other people. He is very responsible, and much more mature than he lets on to be. He usually takes other people's problems into his own hands to help them as much as he can.\\n\r\nFurukawa Nagisa - A softspoken, shy girl. She opens more once she met Tomoya on the day of the opening ceremony, and becomes great friends with him. She quickly makes many friends with the help of Tomoya. She is naturally weak, as she was born with a frail body, yet she tries everything with everything she has. She also has a tendency to cry easily, and is very caring for others.\\n\r\nSunohara Youhei - Delinquent, met Tomoya through a mutual trouble making incident. He is loud, obnoxious, and has trouble getting girls. However, he, like Tomoya, is secretly very caring. He is often referred to as a clown and a jokester, because he is not as mature as Tomoya is.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has so many important characters I would love to go on, but this gives you an idea of how some people work. On paper, they seem generic, but once you watch the show you will truly understand this masterpiece of character design.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. 10/10\\n\r\nMY NUMBER ONE ANIME. WATCH CLANNAD AND WATCH CLANNAD: AS!!!! \\n\r\nI can easily give my favorite anime a 10/10 on enjoyment. I mean, why is it my number one if i didnt enjoy it? \\n\\n\r\nTHANKS FOR READING! Hope my review helped decide whether you should watch this or not. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Clannad is more than just your average slice of life drama. It has a supernatural substory that starts from the first Clannad and you don't really figure it out until the last episode of afterstory.\r\nThere are lights that appear at happy moments and a ghost girl trying to get to older sister to find her own happiness.\r\nHowever, for someone to fully appreciate Clannad they'd have to have played the visual novel. There are extras called the Kyou and Tomyo arch and the last episode of the series acted as a sort of reset. It's better to think of it as \"okay, so that's one endingwhat would've happened if the people had lived? Or if he chosen this girl?\" Now you get to peek into some of the other possibilities.  I was sort of disappointed that my favorite character didn't get an arch with Tomoya (an Tomoya x Kotomi story).\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is funny and sometimes just the characters actions were enough to make you laugh. Some of the characters, such as Fuko, were just too cute but the overly cute moments didn't last long and then it was just the right amount of sweet to counteract the more dramatic parts of the show, especially with Kotomi and Ushio. There is something in this anime for everyone almost.\\n\\n\r\nThe movie is a bit different from the anime but covers all the main plot points in a shorter amount of time is worth the watch. You won't feel as connected to the characters if you don't watch the anime first but it's just as beautiful none the less. I actually liked the \"other world\" people's betrayal better in the movie as it makes a little more sense than the two people in the movie but you're opinions may vary.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and music is absolutely stunning. I'd suggest watching it with subs though as the dub voices just don't match the characters. At first the tune to \"the big dango family\" is just kind of meh but by the time you finish the series you'll find that cute little tune stuck in your head.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Allow me, before beginning, to quickly summarise my opinion of Clannad's first season, as I don't particularly fancy writing an entire review about it. Clannad season 1 was incredibly effective at delivering some serious emotional impact, but was arguably very melodramatic. Now that it's occurred to me, I can't escape the feeling that the first season was almost entirely filler, existing solely to skim over the VN arcs of the other characters without contributing anything particularly significant to the story, nor delivering any particular message. Ultimately, the directors could've taken several scenes in series 1 and tacked them onto the beginning of After Story, andpotentially produced a show that was of equal or better quality. I almost didn't watch After Story at all.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, to be honest, my initial reaction was to drop it after only one episode, before picking it up again some weeks later. After Story begins with much of the same thing, resolving the arcs that were left untouched by season 1; those of the Sunohara siblings, Misae and Yukine. While this is my personal opinion, the first 2 arcs in particular didn't even possess much impact. I didn't cry at all. The third arc is when Clannad After Story begins to show its true colours, and while it is undeniably more of the same thing, the maturity of After Story begins to show at last, and I finally found myself crying after an underwhelming beginning. After that, it ditches the arc structure in favour of (finally) developing the primary characters of Tomoya and Nagisa, thus reaching its thematic crux.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, the latter half of After Story is when Clannad finally reveals the true reason for its existence. It discusses some mature themes: gang violence, drug abuse, depression and, at its core, family. In some ways, the characters of Tomoya and Nagisa mature with the series. Far from simply being moving, After Story becomes powerful. It has meaning. We finally begin to witness ideas that are relevant in some way, perhaps, to our own lives. The melodrama remains, but only serves to accentuate the ideas rather than failing to serve any purpose at all. And there are elements of the series that will leave you genuinely shaken, in particular two incredibly heart-wrenching scenes that reduced me to a flood of uncontrollable tears. Me, who is so cold that if you licked me your tongue would get stuck to my skin. God, that metaphor sounded so much better in my head.\\n\\n\r\nThat all aside, the ending is bloody awful. After one of those aforementioned heartbreakers, the final episode does some pretty strange stuff. And I personally choose to believe it never happened. I elect to believe that Clannad After Story's most heartbreaking scene is also its ending. But I can't escape that fact that that episode exists, and ruined an otherwise perfect second half.\\n\r\nAlso, and I hate to say it, but I now despise Fuko. She annoys me too much for me to return to my previous adoration for her in season 1.\\n\\n\r\nGuh, I hate using such emotive terminology when reviewing a series, but it's so difficult not to with Clannad. From a more objective standpoint, After Story's execution also improves drastically in the second half. The art remains about the same, with the only changes being representative of the physical growth of the characters. And the opening sequence is absolutely stunning!\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, After Story is deceptively samey at first, but absolutely beautiful if you're willing to endure the initial arcs. A vast improvement on an average series, and arguably Key's greatest achievement. Even if you didn't particularly like season 1, watch season 2. You won't be disappointed!",

            "content": "There are probably hundreds of reviews on clannad and clannad:afterstory already. As a relatively new anime enthousiast, I can not resist the temptations to write a review of my own after just having finished this great anime. In this review, I will be refering to both clannad and clannad:afterstory because the 2 seasons are connected and inseparable from each other.\r\nStory: 10\r\nNormally, I hate a story that just revolved around school life because the events that happen are repetitive. Clearly, Clannad is an exception. Despite the plot revolving around normal stuff that happens in school and in the community, the story is somehow very touching. Theanime has plot, as there are twists and turns that occur in the story. Through the 50 episodes, the relationship between Tomoya and Nagisa is well developed. Some of the main themes, such as growing up and finding a purpose in life, are portrayed masterfully in this normal setting. Not only that, the audience can get to know the backstories of pretty much every character in this anime. Some may call these backstories fillers, but I would like to think that they are important in both bringing emotions to the story as well as portraying all the characters. However, the most innovative part of this anime is the story/myth of \"the girl who lives in a lonely world\" that runs parallel to Tomoya and Nagisa's story. This story reflects Tomoya and Nagisa's states of mind at different stages of their relationship, and contribute nicely to the story (not mentioning the miracle in the end).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nI have to admit that I don't usually pay much attention to art in anime or manga unless it is so crappy that it severely affects my enjoyment. To be safe, I give an arbitrary value of 8. However, i think the arts is actually well done because the characters' personalities and mood are well portrayed in their expressions. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe intro song for both clannad and clannad:afterstory is just amazing. They bring emotions and lift my hearts up. Even though I disliked the ending song for clannad (dango family song) at first, I realized its importance in the story and came to appreciate it in the end. The excerpt songs during some especially dramatic scenes are again, amazing. I watched the dub version, which most people dislike. However, I found that the voice actors did a good job, as the voice of each character is realistic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThis is perhaps the most definte 10 I've ever given. The characters portrayed in this anime is so realistic that the audiences feel like the events that happened in anime happened to themselves. The personalities of the protagonists, Nagisa and Tomoya, are so well portrayed that it feels like that the audience know them. Both nagisa and Tomoya are dynamic characters. Both of them overcame their problems by relying on each other, their friends, and their courage to change. Through their change, we see the strength in these characters, and come to love them. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nWhat can I say, clannad series is the best drama genre anime that I have watched so far, though I haven't watched a lot of animes yet. I cried for an accumulated time of more than 100 minutes in clannad, due to the realistic portrayal of the characters and the story. Believe me, anyone who doesn't cry once through this anime has either heart of steel, or are not mature enough to appreciate the depth of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI guess just like a lot of other people, I really enjoyed this anime. The summary of this anime may put off some people, as school based drama are usually boring in my opinion. However, I guarantee that anyone that appreciate drama will not be dissapointed in watching this anime.",

Usually in my experience, when something is bragged up to being great, it turns out to be a major disappointment. However, all I can say is WOW! I was BLOWN AWAY! I have to admit that Clannad: After Story was one of the biggest emotional roller coasters of a series I've ever seen, and that's saying something considering how great I found similar series like Angel Beats! and ef-a tale of memories (and melodies) to be. This series was painful to watch and I don't meanin a bad way. Unfortunately, if you went into this series expecting everything to be the same as the original Clannad series, you'd be dead wrong. This series sways much more toward the drama and tragedy aspects than the comedy. This series really plays at your emotions and I have to admit, the latter 2/3 of the series was difficult to sit through on the emotional level. I can't count on one hand how many times I was brought to tears during this stretch. I really enjoy anime series that make me feel and think. This series did both and the nice thing about it is it really gets you to think about your own life and the relationships you form, whether it be with family, friends, your lover, or your child.\\n\\n\r\nThe series essentially picks up where Clannad left off...which worked fine for me because I had some criticisms about how open-ended the original series left off. I would highly recommend watching the first series before watching this since I felt the character building in the first series set After Story up rather well. On top of that, it might be easier to pick up on the junk doll and girl story. \\n\\n\r\nThe strength of this series goes back to the characters. The characters are brilliantly written and unlike the first season, I found the story did a better job of narrowing down the roles of the characters. It wasn't the case early on since the first 9 or 10 episodes of the series focused around the Theater Club and some of the hi-jinx involved. However, around episode 9 or 10 is when the ball really got rolling and focused more on the lead characters, Tomoya and Nagisa. To avoid major spoilers, this is where the series took a major U-turn into the drama, romance, and tragedy. Nevertheless, I have to say the next 14 episodes would be some of the most heartwrenching moments I've ever experienced watching an anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnother strong point of this series also goes back to the first season as well. The animation and music for this series set a mood that is unmatched. I have to give props to Jun Maeda yet again because the score to this series was God damn brilliant! From OP, to BGM, to insert songs, to ED, the guy played his cards perfectly. Yet again, Lia performed the OP and ED to this series as well as some of the insert songs...and my God is she a perfect performer for this series. Toki o Kizamu Uta, the series OP is one of the most breathtaking songs I've ever heard in an anime. The music as well as the animation was downright fantastic and it had me looking forward to every episode. From an overall production standpoint, I can't help but call Clannad: After Story \"a masterpiece in animation.\"\\n\\n\r\nHowever, while I did give this series a 10, I'll admit that this series did have some notable flaws. I will admit the first 1/3 of this series didn't get off to the best of starts. For the most part, it felt like filler between the first series and the latter 2/3 of After Story. It wasn't \"bad\" per se, but seemed awkwardly placed. However, that wouldn't be the first occasion of \"awkward placement\" in terms of episodes. I have to admit that episode 23 might have been the most worthless episode I've ever seen to a series and considering it's placement, it really shouldn't have been there in the first place. It would've worked fine as a post-Clannad OVA or even a post-After Story OVA...but the second to last episode? It had no business being there.\\n\\n\r\nOddly enough, this series ended with a recap episode. Usually by my book, this is a major flaw. I am not a big fan of recap episodes in anime and I usually find them to be unnecessary padding. However, I found this to be one of the most brilliantly written recap episodes I've ever seen and it actually cleared up some confusion I had about events in the few episodes leading up to it. I have to admit, the series takes some pretty odd turns toward the end and I found them a little hard to follow. However, the recap episode cleaned everything up perfectly. I never thought I'd say this...but the recap episode saved this series for me and ended the series on the highest of notes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, there have only been a handful of series in my life that I can say I was \"touched\" by and this was one of them. I love a series that not only tells a brilliant story, but also makes you think about your own life. This is really a great series to watch if you're in your last year of high school or first year of college because of how heavy-handed it is with it's real-life themes. While yes, I'm aware there are supernatural elements to this series, the message it sends across is easily connected to life events. If you go into this series expecting more or less the same as Clannad, you'll be in for a major surprise for the latter 2/3 of the series, although it will be more or less the same for the first 1/3. Again, I'd highly recommend watching the first season before this one. I don't think it's COMPLETELY necessary but I believe the first season builds some pretty good bonds between the characters and would make you appreciate them that much more in After Story. I will come out and say this was one of the best series I have ever watched and even with it's moments of awkward episode placement, it's one of the most brilliantly written animes I've ever watched. I give it my highest recommendation to anyone, but make sure to go into it with the right mindset or else it could throw you for a loop. I have no qualms in calling Clannad: After Story an anime masterpiece.",

            "content": "This is something really special. \r\nNo show is perfect and this one certainly isn't,  but when taken with its predecessor for context it is undeniably marvelous. The struggles of Tomoya and Nagisa continue on from Clannad season 1 and their lives are transformed in major ways for better and worse throughout the duration of this season. The entire cast is grand but it's really these two who elevate this season above the previous one.  KyoAni's production values speak for themselves as always. The show is gorgeous even by today's standards despite being 10 years old now, which is really a testament to theefforts of the crew. The same can be said of the sound. The voice cast is carried over from the previous season as well as the visual novel and they all do a great job. The enjoyment factor of this series is difficult to judge considering that a large part of what makes this show so excellent is how effortlessly it manipulates the emotions of its audience. It's no secret by now that After Story is a story of both great happiness and intense sorrow, with the latter progressively becoming more prominent as the series draws on. A proper emotional rollercoaster. All in all, After Story is an excellent show that shines bright among a plethora of VN adaptations. Its flaws are ultimately overshadowed by the immensity of the story, the masterfully balanced of tone and the skill of the production team. It changed the way I looked at the adult world when I first saw it, which is something no other anime has done. \\n\\n\r\nI can't recommend it highly enough.",

If you watch it and experience the vast amount of feelings that the viewers have, you will understand\r\nStory: 10/10: Clannads story was a mixture of touching and laughable. This anime did a great job at incorporating all the things necessary to create a successful romance anime. It made us laugh at the right time, and made us feel emotional at the right times. What's different about this anime from most romance anime is that it depicts the lives of thecharacters after they actually get together. Most romance anime are mostly some guy trying to chase a girl for a number of episodes and they finally get together in the last episode and kiss. The fact that Clannad: After Story is different from the cliches gave a necessary change to how I see romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10: Th characters are exactly what made this anime how great it really is. Despite having a good amount of characters, this anime well developed all of them and made them each stand out when Tomoya had to assist them with there issues. You can clearly tell how much effort was put into developing these characters and that effort proved successful throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound 10/10: Despite coming out 8 years ago I had issues with the art or sound in Clannad/Clannad: After Story. The anime flowed very well. Kyoto animation did a great job with the animation and the voice actresses thoroughly displayed the feelings of there characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: At first this anime can see a little strange. I watched the first episode a long time ago and i was disappointed. I gave up on this anime and it was actually the first anime i never completed after watching the first episode. Awhile later i tried again and this time found that this anime holds so many sentimental moments and funny characters and i began to love it more and more By the time i finished i knew it was one of if not the best romance anime's i have eve viewed and thats still true to this day even though i've lost count of how many i watched in total.",

            "content": "\"I'm weak too, but if we were together, I think we can become stronger.\"-Nagisa Furukawa\r\nThis isn't an anime, this is an experience that can't be felt in any other anime, movies, games, etc. If you were to say that After Story had good romance, character development, and drama it wouldn't do this show justice. You need to see this in order to know just how good After Story is. It does have it duds here and there, but what show doesn't? (Besides FMA and Brotherhood in my opinion.) The positives do weigh out the negatives in the show though. The good stuff in After Storyis so good that it could be one of my favorites. What good stuff is in After Story you may be asking to yourself? Well, that's a really simple question to answer. The romance and drama were defiantly the standouts of the show and what people mostly remember After Story for. People really don't remember the comedy scenes in After Story though. I won't say what the funniest moment in After Story were because of spoilers, but I will say, you will be laughing your but off when that scene pops up. I think the biggest thing that makes After Story so unique to me is the lessons it teaches you. They don't straight up tell the audience/characters what their morels are, you just figure out by thinking about the moments being said in After Story. It's just those things that make After Story one of my favorites. Now shall I take you on a journey through After Story's world?\\n\\n\r\nStory 9.00/10 Standout(s) The 2nd and 3rd parts\\n\\n\r\nTrust me, I love the story in Clannad, I just a couple of problems that I want to get out of the way before I talk about the positives. Cause trust me, there's plenty of good things about After Story. It really does take After Story some time to get to the romance plot, instead, they throw in pointless sub-plots. Those sub-plots being, Sunohara, Misae, and Yukine. I want to cover the one I like the most and the one I don't like at all. First let's talk about Sunohara's plot. I thought the Sunohara plot actually delved more into the character and gave us a little more development from him. It was good, but could have been covered in the first season. Why couldn't he get a sub-plot like Kotomi and Fuko did? It makes no sense at all. Next was Misae, I thought her plot was very touching, but just like the Sunohara plot, it could have been told to us in the first season. Last was the sub-plot that could have been cut all together. It was the one with Yukine. We didn't see much of her character in the first season, so why give her one here? It was very unnecessary and if you toke it away, it wouldn't harm anything about this show. Well that's enough me rambling on, let's talk about the best things about After Story.\\n\\n\r\nI think the biggest thing that makes the story in After Story so memorable is the swaps between comedy and drama. We all remember After Story mostly in the drama department, but like I said in the beginning of the review, most people seem to overlook the comedy. The comedy scenes are some of the most funniest moments I've seen in any anime. It's not just goofy Japanese comedy you see in many other anime, they will make you laugh your but off and make you laugh so much that you can't even breath. It gives you a break from the really sad moments and gives you some comedy. So it's not just pure drama in After Story, that would be way too depressing. I think the creators made the smart choice of not just keeping it depressing all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nThe last few things I really loved about Clannad's story were the 2nd and 3rd parts of the show. Those were some of the most emotional and beautiful moments of any anime I've ever seen. They will defiantly make you cry a bucket of tears. I know it did for me at least. I just wanted to point out the ending to the series. It was emotional and touching, but it doesn't really make any sense. I won't spoil it for newcomers, but I found it not that satisfying and really should have been explained a little bit more. Overall, a beautiful and memorable story with some duds here and there.\\n\\n\r\nPositives of the story: 2nd and 3rd parts of the plot, the meaningful messages, and the perfect mix of comedy and drama.\\n\r\nNegatives of the story: Confusing ending and pointless sub-plots in the 1st part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation 9.90/10 Standout(s) The backgrounds\\n\\n\r\nThe art in After Story is distinct and catches your eye immediately. This especially shines in the beautiful backgrounds of the show. I really loved that scene were Tomoya takes a character who I won't spoil at all to a field of flowers. You know that they put a lot of effort into the scenery of all the places the characters were. Even if it was a simple house or playground, they put immense detail into it. I love how the characters were drawn. This is Key after all, the same people who worked on Air and Kanon. You can tell that this is a Key anime by the way the characters looked like. The big eyes on the female characters may bothersome to some people, but if your able to take that, then you will absolutely love the character designs in After Story. The animation was always fluid and never toke a break. They always paid attention to detail and it really shows. Overall, gorgeous art, backgrounds, and animation.\\n\\n\r\nPositives in the Art and Animation: Beautiful backgrounds, unique character designs, and fluid animation\\n\r\nNegatives in the Art and Animation: I guess the big eyes of some of the characters may bother some people. It might give off the impression that this is one of those \"Moe\" shows. Don't think that at all please. It isn't like that at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10 Standout(s) Nagisa (Soundtrack)\\n\\n\r\nIt was really hard to find a standout in After Story's sound. It's just so, well, how do I put this into regular words, all I can say is that it's so elegant and calming. I just have to put it at that until I find a word that fits in with that definition. Let's talk about them individually, Shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack:\\n\\n\r\nProbably the best soundtrack I've ever heard, not just anime, but in any sort of entertainment itself. It was really hard to find a piece in the soundtrack I didn't like or at least stood out from the crowd. It was also hard to chose which one was my favorite out of all of them. Then I went back on \"Nagisa\" and found out which of these I loved the most. Nagisa is the Dango song on the piano and some other instruments. It really fit Nagisa's character and let me see her in a new light. It's not just some music, but something inspirational and will stay with you all your life. You need to listen to it if you haven't already. Some other soundtracks you should listen to are Shining in the Sky, The Places were Wishes come True II, and Snowfield. Now let's talk about the opening.\\n\\n\r\nOpening:\\n\\n\r\nWith Lia's beautiful voice and Key's wonderful animation, what do you get? A really well done and gorgeous opening. Lia really helped to make this average opening style, beautiful and fresh again. I loved it when she sang the slow parts of the opening. It really fit with the anime and I think made it even more greater. So props to Lia and Key animation for making one of my favorite openings of all time. Overall, beautiful opening and added a ton to the show.\\n\\n\r\nPositives of the sound: Everything\\n\r\nNegatives in the sound: None\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.95/10 Standout(s) Tomoya and Nagisa\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best character casts I've seen in anime. I guess my only problem with the characters in this season is that they don't really get that much screen time. I'd love to see Kotomi a bit more in this season or Kyou and Ryou. Kyou and Ryou get an OVA with them in the main focus, but this isn't a review of that just yet. I wanted to go in depth on Tomoya and Nagisa for a bit.\\n\\n\r\nTomoya:\\n\\n\r\nIn the first season, Tomoya was an outcast at his school. Until he met a girl named Nagisa. We'll go over her in a bit. He thought he had a crappy life because of family issues. Once he met Nagisa, he started to look at things in a new light. He'd probably never had seen it without her. What I think makes Tomoya a great lead is the development he goes though in season two. You love him, hate him, cry with him, sympathize with him, and learn to love him again. He probably had the best development I've ever seen in an anime. I can't really talk about him without spoiling the show, so let's move on.\\n\\n\r\nNagisa:\\n\\n\r\nWhen you hear the word \"Clannad\" you'll normally think of this character. There is a reason why people think of Nagisa when they hear that anime come up. Still, I won't spoil why, but you'll need your tissues around then. Nagisa wasn't the strongest or most confident girl in the show. In fact, she gets quit weak due to illnesses. She stills tries to pull in and stay strong throughout the course of the show. You'd probably wounder why Tomoya would fall in love with a girl like her, but I think the reason why is that she's hard-working, loving, and will do anything for him. She has the perfect personality and provides very memorable lines you will think about in life. Like the quote I put above this review. Nagisa is a truly loving and memorable character. There's a reason why so many people love her and why she's my profile picture. Overall, perfect character.\\n\\n\r\nPositives in the Characters: Strong couple and memorable characters\\n\r\nNegatives in the Characters: Side characters from the first season don't get enough screen time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nPeople who will love this anime: Romance fans, Drama fans, and basically anyone.\\n\r\nPeople who will hate this anime: I have no clue who wouldn't.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9.75/10\\n\\n\r\nPositives: Beautiful Story, Breath Taking Art and Animation, Outstanding Soundtrack, and Memorable Characters\\n\r\nNegatives: Confusing Ending, The Sub-Plots in the Beginning of the show, and Side Characters appearing not that often.\\n\\n\r\nMinor Issue: Big eyed characters\\n\\n\r\nThis anime needs to be seen to believed, especially fans of romantic drama anime such as myself. I surly recommend this to anyone. The things in this show you can't feel anywhere else. So enjoy the experience while it lasts! You sure won't regret watching this. You have no excuse not to watch this if your a romance fan. Well that's it for me, I hope you enjoyed the review!",

            "content": "Clannad After Story is a direct continuation of the story of its predecessor. What could have been a half-assed cash in on the original actually turns out to be one of the best second seasons of an anime I\u2019ve ever seen. While it does have points that it loses momentum and feels kind of like filler, it tells three very distinct, yet connected stories that really seems to work to its emotional advantage. It divides itself between high school dating, marriage, and adulthood. It really shows a progression that gives it the emotional charm that truly makes the show so successful.\r\nThe following review is rifewith spoilers, especially the story section. Anyone planning to watch it, but not wishing to have the whole show ruined by me, please skip the story section. I\u2019ll try to keep any spoilers in the other sections to a bare minimum, but this is a warning from me to you. I don\u2019t need angry people with pitchforks and torches standing outside of my door in the morning. So you have been warned.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe original Clannad focused on not only the romantic plot that seemed to be kind of a side story among many side stories, but also many other character\u2019s backgrounds and stories. Clannad After Story does focus on the romance a lot more, and it is well done. The first part of the series focuses on school life as Tomoya finishes high school and Nagisa gets sick and has to go through the grade again. During this time we see a deep emotional connection between the characters, but we also get some baffling seemingly filler episodes concerning the dorm master lady who is not even a character that anyone really cares about at that point. After her side story, we get another half episode of side story about a rocker who I guess is the Kurt Cobain of Japan or something. I really didn\u2019t care, I wanted more of the romantic plot and the characters I cared about.\\n\\n\r\nSo the first part of the series is more of what we have come to expect, except Tomoya and Nagisa are dating. The second part is marriage. This comes not as a surprise to anyone of course, but it is a truly heartfelt part where character emotions come into play and we start to get a deep sense of love for these characters, more so than before. As the plot continues, with the birth of Ushio and the death of Nagisa we are plunged into the sudden depths of total despair with Tomoya. This is the part that really made me laugh and cry right along with him. It was heartfelt, it was intense, it was deeply human. Sure it had it\u2019s comedy moments, but it gave you a sense of drama that is unparalleled by most anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe end truly baffled me though, and I\u2019m not going to detract any points because of it, but it just seemed kind of nuts. Nagisa lives, Ushio lives, and everyone lives happily ever after in some sort of weird-ass alternate dimension, symbolic thing. Maybe I\u2019m too stupid to understand, which I have said for quite a few anime with truly weird endings. I mean, I see what it was trying to do, but the ending was kind of out there. It did give me a good feeling, it made me happy, it ended with everything tied up. But the way it ended wasn\u2019t what I was expecting.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nThe animation is just as good as it was for Clannad. It\u2019s nothing superb or amazing or breathtaking, but it is good. Characters eyes still come across as strange to me. I don\u2019t know why because anime characters have huge eyes most of the time. That\u2019s a given. Yet for some reason, maybe the size of their eyes or something, the girls on this show have eyes that are odd. They don\u2019t detract from anything and actually bring across emotion very well. I digress though.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nPart of the drama of the show comes across so well thanks to the amazing voice work. Tomoya\u2019s voice actor in particular plays his role to a T and never fails to impress. Emotions are injected into every scene by the voice work. The music doesn\u2019t fail either. It has some good music, both the opening and ending are good. Music during the show is essentially the same as Clannad so don\u2019t expect much else. There is a strange song sung in English that makes less sense than a drunk Sylvester Stallone\u2019s recital of Hamlet.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nI can\u2019t tell you how great the characters of the series are. I just can\u2019t. They are beyond words. The original series I commended for the characters but this second series I commend even further. Character development is so well done  and you can see so many changes in every character from beginning to end. This plays into why the emotional scenes work, the characters are so lifelike, so relatable. It makes the show even more fun to watch when you can find characters that you can invest yourself in. Tomoya was especially a great character for me. The tough guy persona but deep inside he\u2019s a friendly, loving, caring person. Nagisa is also a great character. Her development is just as good as Tomoya\u2019s. As Tomoya makes revelations, as the pasts of characters are revealed, it\u2019s amazing how human they seem. I mean, these essentially cartoon characters act even more realistic than the real humans on television. This is the reason the drama works so well and pulls at your heartstrings as much as it does.\\n\\n\r\nTo make a long story short, there are no bad characters. There are no unlikeable characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nClannad After Story is an excellent addition to the series and actually exceeds the original in many aspects. When you get further through the series, maybe halfway through, you see a completely different Clannad that turns out to be even more deeply moving, charming, and likeable than the original. Ask me what I would give this anime halfway through and I would probably answer a 7. It didn\u2019t add a lot to the overall formula. But it changes. The series taken as a whole is phenomenal as far as romance/drama\u2019s go. This particular season is a huge part of that. It\u2019s a great ending to the series.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s the best drama anime I\u2019ve ever seen.",

            "content": "First off I most comment that Clannad: After Story is my favorite anime and I may have some bias towards it.\r\nStory: 10\r\nThis is an example of a romance done right.  The story itself is nothing special. The first few episodes have their own in-closed story. Beyond that the story focuses around Tomoya and Nagisa's growing relationship. You follow along as they go through good times and rough times. The real enjoyment from the story is being able to connect with the characters on an emotional level (which Clannad does very well) \r\nArt/Animation: 9\r\nSimilar to other KEY adaptations like Air and Kanon 2006, Clannad followsthe same character design. Very moe-isc with KEY's signature style of big eyes. The animation is done by Kyoto Animation and is of quality. No derp-faces, weird movements, or blurred backgrounds. What you'd come to expect from Kyoani. As with there other and more recent anime, Clannad does not disappoint in this aspect.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is a beautiful array of music that fit the scenes very well. There's music for happy scenes, and sad scenes. The music adds a sense of depth to the scenes that they accompany and help to make those scenes seem more alive. The OP is a nice piano melody with a soft yet vocally powerful song. The ED is a complete contrast to the sad ending any given episode usually has. I personally don't like it but some of you might. Depending on whether or not you like the song and or are ok with the drastic tone shift.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are likable and have a lot of development and back story. Some characters even get dedicated episodes to flesh them out a bit more. They also did this in the first season, for characters like Fuuko and Kotomi. This character development adds depth and realism to the characters. You grow attached to them and you feel for the struggles that they go through. You feel the emotion that these characters convey, whether it be on a subconscious or a personal level.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime through and through. I can watch it multiple times and it still leaves a lasting impression on me every time. We all have that one anime that we regard as perfect. For me, that anime is Clannad. If you dropped Clannad on the first season, give After Story a shot. It is truly a masterpiece of an anime and I highly recommend it.",

            "content": "Note: My reviews for both parts of clannad are essentially the same with only minor tweaks, as they are so heavily linked\r\nAlso may contain minor spoilers (potentially)\r\nStory 10/10\r\nWhere to begin...\r\nThe story in this anime is truly incredible, though some parts may be a little confusing for some, the story that was started by Clannad is completed. While I personally thought the original Clannad took a little too long to ramp up, it is so worth it for this series. The story is probably so good as every event has so much emotion and meaning behind it.\r\nArt 10/10\r\nThe art style is quite simple but its aslice of life anime, it doesnt need to show off with fancy fight sequences or the like. It just needs to be good at certain things especially the emotions of the characters. Every face in clannad is well done, they all fit the moment perfectly whether to rip you a new feels hole or to make you laugh like a maniac, the job is done perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nThe atmosphere is fit very well by the soundtrack. I dont know much about music so I will not go into depth here, but I will say this, I enjoyed the music almost to a stupid degree, which is enough for me. My favorite song is also probably the most played song throughout, which is Dango Daikazoku. It to me sums up the emotions behind clannad all the times it made me laugh and shed a tear or two... I mean sports!!! Gonna go chop down a tree and wrestle a bear or two. Im manly... leave me alone. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\n*composes self from minor breakdown*\\n\r\nThere is so much to say about every character in clannad that i will not go into much detail.\\n\r\nOkazaki- The main protagonist and the reason you will be laughing most of the time, protagonists like him make shows like Clannad incredible. He is well developed as the series progresses and you watch him grow so much through the series. I still go back and watch some of the clips of his pranks when i need a laugh.\\n\r\nNagisa- Im not going to lie I started to look forward to her being on the screen probably more than anything else in the anime. She drives literally the whole story of both seasons and I honestly hate myself when I consider that i didn't like her much at the start. I dont really want to say much about her in case I spoil any of even the early arcs as she is so heavily tied to the story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nIn my opinion after story is truly perfect and even though the first season starts a little slow, I would never have even considered regretting a single moment of either.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has one flaw:\\n\r\nThat it has to end.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n(||)\\n\r\nCheeky dango",

            "content": "So after crying buckets of tears i finally decided to bring myself to do this review.\r\nThere was nothing more i could ask for from a romance/drama/sliceoflife anime and i thought it was beautiful. I do recommend watching the opening for Clannad after story first of all and this is because the opening was done so well as to set the mood for the show. Regardless of whether or not the episode was going to be a sad or happy one, the opening gives you this feeling of relief and the peaceful yet calm opening sets the mood immediately. \r\nEach episode then takes on the task(andcompleting it perfectly) of bringing the viewers into the world of Tomoya and his friends. As the story progresses another deep past is revealed drawing the viewers into watching and not disappointing at any part of the season. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also an all time favourite personally as the climatic moments in the story combined with the perfect sound tracks makes its viewers experience tons of emotions and if you were many episodes in one setting, these emotions wont subside until you stop watching. As for me these emotions carried over even into my sleep as well as my next day which to me proves how powerful the story is.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all this makes for the most outstanding series and most of times were filled with tears of sadness and joy. A MUST watch for ANYONE into the sliceoflife/romance/drama genres.",

            "content": "Believe it or not, Clannad changed my life.  It's so wonderful, I can't really describe it with mere words.\r\n-Story:\r\n.Setting: Clannad revolves around a male protagonist Tomoya Okazaki who hates his everyday life. But his life changes after he meets Nagisa Furukawa, who is actually one year senior to him but is repeating due to illness. After they meet, both of their lives take a three sixty degree turn. \r\n.Review: ~After Story~ is a direct sequel to Clannad and watching Clannad is highly recommended before you jump to ~After Story~. It's really well thought out and brilliantly executed. The first half of After Story followsthe same Clannad Storytelling. But the real anime starts after Episode 16.  Damn. How can a story be this heart touching. I spent countless hours crying right after watching an episode of After Story. Made me shed manly tears. Some scenes  shall stick to my heart for Eternity. It's flawless.\\n\\n\r\n-Art:\\n\r\nThe animation was pretty good. KyoAni did an excellent job. The thing I liked the most is the color variation. The camera angles were good too.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound:\\n\r\nSound was FANTASTIC. At first, I didn't like the OP at all(Toki Wo Kizamu Uta). It took a while to grew on me. The background scores were fitting. Jun Maeda and Shinji Orito did a remarkable task. I still frequent tracks like \"Chiisana Te No Hira\" and \"Dango Daikazoku\". If the music wasn't this good, I doubt if I had cried this much. The seiyuu's and English voice actors both did  perfect. Tomoya's VA! Oh God. 'Legendaddy'. \\n\\n\r\n-Characters:\\n\r\nKey's works never ceases to shine in this section. I got emotionally attached to Tomoya, Nagisa and Ushio while watching this show. Supporting characters like Youhei,Kyou,Ryou, Kotomi shined bright. Hats off.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment:\\n\r\nI cried countless times while watching Clannad series(Manly tears lol). But the ending made me shed tears of Joy! My favourite series. Clannad series has a rewatch value of infinity.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall:\\n\r\nClannad is my #1 anime. Couldn't want anything more. Made me a better human being. If you haven't watched it, watch it NOW!\\n\\n\r\n10/10",

Like 20 times Gladiator and Titanic together. Better than any book, any anime, or any non-anime movie.\r\nIt's not just that it made me, an adult guy, cry.

Instead of wasting time on reading this review why don't you go on and watch it? Why are you wasting time when you could be shedding tears like I ALMOST did. I don't know if I have the balls or the coldest heart to only get watery eyes, but you MUST be prepared mentally or you'll need a lot of tissues. Now, lets get on with this review since your such a stubborn bastard to even keep on reading this.\r\nStory 10:\r\nThe story has an amazinghook that will keep having you wanting to come back for more. Always wondering why the characters chose to do what they did. They have their reasons of why they chose their paths, and a result follows with it. So the story is very engaging. Once you hear the story, you'll want to find more about it. If you want to hear a summery of what I am talking about you WONT find it here. As there is already a synopsis written for you. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10:\\n\r\nThe characters look beautifully drawn, and all tho they are Moe characters, they still look adorable. If your not into Moe characters you will be now once you watch this.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10:\\n\r\nThe sound is crystal clear if you download the episodes like I did. With the sound on, everything seems to have been given life.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10:\\n\r\nTheir personalities fit so well I completely forgot there was a voice actor voicing them. They seem to act completely like a real person would. So the characters are VERY lively. Each having their own feelings, perspectives, and motivations in doing something. So their choices and actions are very fascinating when they decide to do something.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10:\\n\r\nI have completely enjoyed this as much as anyone else would. Anyone who does not enjoy this even in the tiniest bit has NO SOUL! O_O\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10:\\n\r\nTo say this anime did not move you like it did me would be proving your only lying to yourself thus hurting your SOUL! Either that or your a cold hearted bastard who deserves to be round house kicked in the face by Chuck Norris. Thus entering a universe where you have no significance in living and would be better off dead. So do me a favor, and at LEAST try to cry? Because I sure did, but I only got close enough to it where everything was blurry. Thus having watery eyes. As I said before, I DID NOT CRY! Yet I wonder why? This concludes my review in saying you just wasted your time in reading my review instead of using your time wisely and watching Clannad: After Story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Clannad After Story is the second season of Clannad,an Anime based on a Visual Novel produced by Key,and animated by Kyoto Animation.This is my first review,so i'll put things simply and mention the basic points where the score is given.\r\n----\r\nStory:10 out of 10\r\nThe plot of Clannad AS continues  where the first season left off,so to enjoy it you'll have to watch Clannad first.The story start off based on arcs,like the first season,and covers up the characters that weren't previously developed.As you can expect,these ''side-stories'' are really,really great.You'll never find anything out of place,and almost every one of these side-stories have a linking to themain couple.And the Plot of AS focus on the story of the life of this couple,all the hardships they went through,and how they deal with it.To me,this is the only Anime that shows you the meaning of getting a goal in life,something to protect.It also makes you feel(at least a little bit)how it is to lose someone,or something important to you.\\n\r\n----\\n\r\nArt:10 out of 10\\n\r\nEven better than the 1st season,the artwork and animation on AS is gourgeous.Even until this very day,i haven't seen an Anime with such a good expression before.Every single character perfectly reaches you with the emotions they're feeling.Happines,Sadness,Joy,Grief...Human emotions.The background is also really beaultiful.\\n\r\n----\\n\r\nSound:10 out of 10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is as amazing as the art.Happy tunes for comedy relief,and EXTREMELY DEPRESSING tunes on sad moments.There's also epic vocal songs to the main points of the plot.And by epic,i mean it,you'll feel overwhelmed when you hear it.\\n\r\n----\\n\r\nCharacter:9 out of 10\\n\r\nEvery character is awesome,there's no denying to that.This is porbably the very first Anime i watched that i didn't dislike any of the characters.Every one have their own past,their own problems in life.The reason i didn't give this a 10,is beacuse characters that where introduced in almost don't appear in AS,since it focuses mainly on new characters and the main couple.But don't worry,they weren't forgotten.And before i forget,Okazaki Tomoya is probably the best protagonist i ever saw on an Anime.\\n\r\n----\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall:10 out of 10\\n\r\nYou'll probably are saying:''What,10 to everything?This guy has low standards...''.It's not like that.I've what 100+ more Animes,and theres only 3 who got a round 10 out of me.It's just there's no way to give less than this score to Clannad.I don't see this as just an Anime,or just as a series of Japanese Animation.This,is a piece of art that will emotionally touch you.I've never shed any tears reading a book,or watching a movie or series.Why would i cry for an Anime,it's not even real people there.The reason is quite simple,it's all about the feeling.You'll feel things as if they're happening to you directly...Happy moments,and sad moments as well.Even though i neglected to cry watching this,tears just kept rolling down off my eyes.\\n\r\nA definetely must-watch to those who like Drama,and for those who just want to watch an good Anime.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Clannad: After Story 4/10\r\nBiggest weakness - the characters (a shame, because the story had potential, but if you have somebody like Nagisa Furukawa, who is now my officially least likable main character of all time, then it's just painful to watch this anime)\r\nClannad and Clannad: after story are pretty popular shows, so I though I should check it out. But it only took a few episodes to make me hate this series. I figured everything out quickly, because every character is a damn stereotype, even if you try to compensate with a tragic background, they're still boring cliche characters, that I couldn't identify with (especiallythe girls). Except funny dad Akio Furukawa, every one pissed me off, excuse my French. But let's keep it real, what is the most important thing in ANY anime (especially romance)? That's right - the characters! Who voted this show up nr. 2!? Is it really enough for so many people to see some kawaii girls and a troubled boy, trying to figure out life? There are so many great animes out there, with similar and definitely better plots, writing, animation....I can't believe I was able to sit through all episodes. The pseudo melancholic, that didn't move me at all, all the forced dramatic, the first half didn't have much to do with the second half of the anime, but apparently made other people cry and cry *smh*...dull characters that don't exist in real life, I continue to say that because this show is not just trying to be magical, it wants to be realistic...which is the main problem, it is NOT! Very disappointed how mediocre this show is, after reading so many good reviews about it. \\n\r\nI don't recommend this show, simply because there are at least 1000 better animes to recommend.

            "content": "First of all, I would like to say Clannad is definitely on of the most beautiful anime I've seen for the past 9 years I started watching anime. It's story is so fabulous(woah, I've never used that word, haha) that it can make you smile, laugh, frown, cry, and ask for more. It has this somewhat complex charm that appeals to its viewers and it stays true to its promises. \r\nThe art is well-done. I mean, it's well detailed and amazing. Animation is nicely done and some moments are such eye candy. Seeing as how it's a slice of life anime, the art is expectedto seem realistic and it is. The CGI used on some character(s) are also superb. However, it's an anime so we can't expect it to be somewhere near looking like a live-action.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, it fits perfectly to the events of the show. I mean, when the atmosphere is sad, the music helps out the mood. Same goes for being happy. It's not like in some where the mood is sad and then the music is happy, haha. It's music is just right. A nice blend of sad and happy music forming with sad and happy events that makes this one spectacular anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters are very unique and also give importance to the story. What I'm saying is for example: Cinderella could've been anyone, but in Clannad, the main character gives out importance. In other words, a story like Cinderella could've happened to anyone, but a story like Clannad can only happen to its unique characters. Namely Nagisa, the heroine of the story, whose personality and character traits make her important to the story. Likewise the message I'm trying to give is that the story of Cinderella could've happened to Snow White or Sleeping Beauty, but the story of Clannad would hardly happen to characters from another anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, we go for how we enjoy this anime. I've seen many anime from my experiences and I've enjoyed most of them. Clannad is one of those most. With a performance that is phenomenal, you could watch it several times again and again because of the ways it makes you laugh and cry. Overall, Clannad is definately one of the best anime out there...in my opinion, that is. And I do know most of you could agree on that.",

            "content": "You know how some anime tend to make you smile? To make you laugh, or perhaps  make you cry instead? If an anime is well-writen and executed, it will at least induce a certain feeling. In another review I said that an anime made my heart cry. Clannad - After Story did not only that. It made it cry, commit suicide about 15 times, then tore itself up into pieces and glued itself back together. Needless to say, it was a rather painful experience, but I'm glad I sat through it till the end.\r\nAfter Story follows up on the first season of Clannad, butin overall, both seasons are completely different experiences. It involves two of the main characters from the first season, Tomoya and Nagisa, and their evergrowing relationship. At first you may think that the concept itself isn't very unique. But the way their relationship progresses is unlike any other regular anime, as your average high school anime tends to stop at the end of high school. After Story not only surpasses that, it brings us a well-written story of what happened to the two after their debut in the first season. \\n\\n\r\nThe first season helped develop the overall story, shape the characters and their relationships and set the mood, and the second season uses this to its fullest potential by delivering a heartwarming and at the same time a heartbreaking experience, with its happy and sad moments. And when I say sad, I mean really sad, and this is accomplished by the overall character development. Thanks to the base the first season provided, you really feel with the people in After Story far more than you would in any other anime. But of course by getting along with the characters like that, the hardships they face have a much bigger impact than they normally would, and it is understandable if you have to take a (small) break from the anime when you can't bear it anymore. It can really be that sad.\\n\\n\r\nNow, this anime isn't a full-blown Slice of Life like it might sound. It really leans toward the super-natural phenomena the city our main characters live in experiences. In the first season, I didn't care so much about that, and focused more on the main character progression and such. But in the end, it played a rather important role in After Story, and without it, we would not have seen the hardships our couple go through in the anime, and teach them (and us) the lessons they've learned during that time. As long as something like this, the super-natural being an important part in an anime like this one, is done right, it really complements the overall feel and story of it, giving it an even more complete shape than it already had.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really great, with the characters looking either cool or quite cute. The overall color contrasts and lighting are amazingly executed, and it will always create the proper atmosphere for each scene. When a sad scene commences, the ambience, lighting, colors, even the art style will slightly change to maximize the experience we're seeing on screen. Often this will get to you in a way that you didn't expect, and if you notice the sides of your eyes getting a bit watery, it means it has done its job nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThe music... Oh god, the music. There are songs in this anime that will get to you. Not just during the anime, but after you've watched the entire thing, whenever you hear one of the songs played in the show, and especially one in particular, you might have to cover your ears to prevent the memories from seeping in. The music is very well written, and really add to the overall atmosphere this anime has. I wouldn't say it's the best music I've ever heard, but I certainly wouldn't have wanted anything else than what it's got today. They did an amazing job composing the music so that it fits with the proper scenes, and once again will add to the sadness you'll be experiencing when it happens.\\n\\n\r\nAs you may have noticed from my writing, do not watch Clannad and After Story if you have a weak heart, or overall prefer more happy and carefree anime like Lucky Star and Nichijou, and normally I would stick to those anime as well. But let me tell you this. Seldom has an anime moved me the way Clannad did, and I'm really glad I mustered up the courage to sit through it all. In the end, it left me with a satisfied feeling, with pretty much all the questions answered and all the loose ends tied. If you're a fan of anime in general, you should definitely watch this masterpiece. It might rip your heart apart, but it will probably feel like the best thing that has ever happened to you.\\n",

            "content": "Animation:\r\nThe first thing you have to talk about in an anime is the animation! Clannad has never been something to write home to about, but I was pleased to see After Story had some much-needed improvement. Movements were more fluid, facial expressions are TOP NOTCH and really enhance the quality of the scenes, and the backgrounds looked great. I assume the art style was just to keep it in-line with the visual novel and as a result, we have Nagisa's eyes. (UPDATE: In 1080p it SHINES with clear, crisp animation. However, in darker scenes the animation gets cloudy and degrades in quality).\r\nSound:\r\nThe opening is regardedas being one of the best in all of anime fandom. I completely agree and as the series progresses the opening gets better, due to events in the show. The ending is ok; not exactly as good as Secret Base from AnoHana or the ending from the first series, but still decent. The shows actual music is hit or miss. It's a very visual novel-y, which I tend not to like. Fate/Stay Night (also a visual novel originally) had a superior score, redone by Kenji Kawaii. There is one thing that must be said though. In all the moments it has to the music REALLY pulls through and makes the scene. By the time you finish episode 16, you'll understand what I mean.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's dub is mediocre. I wound up watching it subbed and I'm glad I did. Tomoya's voice actor is phenomenal. Every emotion is brought to life as he speaks and it's incredibly convincing. The rest of the cast is also quite good. Akio is melo-dramatic and theatrical. Sanae is always amusing in her comedic crying fits over bread. Fuko is as childish as ever. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with an anime based on a visual novel is that the main character is usually shovelware. This DEFINITELY was NOT the case with Clannad After Story. In fact, Tomoya was one of the most excellent leading characters I have ever seen. All his expressions, reactions, and dialogue is very believable and contains great depth. Granted he isn't as scripted as Lelouch from Code Geass, but this allows the viewer to fill into his role. Thus experiencing the emotion in a more first-hand kind of way. I was never really a fan of Nagisa. Her animation really lets the character down, but in the later parts of After Story, she really comes into her own. Akio is a refreshing character. Managing to be both serious and comedic in equal proportions. The rest of the harem isn't really shown much, but that's understandable considering the flow of the story this time around.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nClannad After Story is a medley of emotions. You'll laugh, shed tears of sadness and tears of joy. You'll feel yourself in the story. The first part of Clannad After Story, which I really enjoyed was when we get to see into Misae's (the dorm mother's) past. That story could EASILY hold its own anime. Very romantic and very fun. The ending was a tad bit stupid though, but it was the predictable ending. The arc about delinquents and gangs was tedious, but it's worth watching to reach the true story of Clannad. Tomoya's life with his family. The ending wasn't what I had hoped for, although most viewers will be satisfied with it (depending on your preferences of course). At the very least it won't leave you bitter. The ending is very visual novel-ish. You \"unlock\" the true route when you collect enough of an item. Despite that, it was a decent ending and the rest of the show's story is phenomenal. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR:\\n\r\nClannad After Story is incredible. Tomoya is one of the greatest characters of all time. The show is VERY emotional. I recommend it to all who enjoy good anime. If you liked this you should also watch Angel Beats (same writer).",

            "content": "As I write this review, I sit beside a bucket full of the manly tears that I shed.\r\nClannad, Clannad: After Story, what an emotional rollercoaster it has been. You made me laugh like a fool, then cry my heart out, all in the blink of an eye.\r\nI really wish the writer(s) got a Booker for the story. Everything from the start to the end was beautifully planned out. Each and every episode felt relevant, adding more quality to the characters and plot.\r\nIndividually, Clannad was good; it depicts the life of a high school delinquent, till he meets the love of his life. Typical high schoolplot, with a lot of take on humour (so much that my roommate probably thinks I need professional 'help'), with a few tear jerking moments. Each episode serves a meaning. In fact, Clannad is not as emotional as After Story, but it builds up the story. The characters literally have life injected into them; you will come to not only fall in love with the characters, but project yourself into a few of them. This part might appear over hyped, but it is rightly so, especially because of what's about to come; it was downright necessary.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Story, where do I start. The first half of the series continued on from Clannad, and depicts the remainder of their highschool lives. Once again, lots of humour, meaningful episodes and nostalgic reminders of school life (I graduated quite a while back, so it does serve as stigma to hidden memories).\\n\\n\r\nCome the second half. I seriously question the legitimacy of my manhood. I cried like I had not in years. Each of the issues that were appearing throughout the series will eventually be answered with the most heart wrenching of conclusions. If you had had a good laugh till now, cherish it; you will be dropped in a well of despair.\\n\\n\r\nBut fear not, as the ending will pick you up, and shine a ray of hope. It does end on a happy note, which I felt was extremely necessary, given all the tears that I had shed. The story is gripping, with the viewer becoming more curious everyday as to the fate of the characters (I binge watched half of After Story in a day, especially when it reached its climax)\\n\\n\r\nAnd FYI, I had read a few of the spoilers beforehand, to prepare myself emotionally, but it still managed to drain the fluids from my body.\\n\\n\r\nWill I give it a rewatch? I fear not, as I am not emotionally prepared to face these turmoils again. A must watch, definitely.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow I need to go watch some shounen/seinen to man myself up again.",

Clannad is like my School life hood, though personality conflict of a slice of life that really fit the genre (you get it). I cry man tears at episode's 18-23.\r\nPlot- 10/10 (Drama is great, comedy is really good, it explanation is fascinating, and the story is breathtaking)What can I say? it about  Tomoya Okazaki, but it forecasting on the harem group of girls. Due to his habit of always arriving late to school, and skipping classes during the day. He major story is about Tomoya learning about the point of having family and friends.

            "content": "I laughed...\r\nI cried...\r\nI experienced something that changed my life... \r\nthat Bob Marley movie was fucking awesome, now, on to the Clannad after story review...\r\n\"After story\" is an adaptation from the original Visual Novel by KEY and the sequel to Clannad, and continues the story of Nagisa and Tomoya okazaki`s relationship with each other and those around them while living in the city that they love so much. \r\nI will admit something before I go any further. I went into this anime not wanting to like it, as I was \u201csuch a big fan\u201d of the orginal manipulating one dimensional turd known as clannad that Ithought I would be in for another big plate of horse shit with this sequel, but as it turned out I would have to get my doctor ordered daily supply of horse shit somewhere else because Clannard after story was a surprisingly good ride proving that you can teach an old dog new tricks, except for my dog sparky, the only new trick he seems to have learned is how to decompose on my couch.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway most people have probably already seen this series before but for those who haven't I will keep spoilers to a minimum. So anyway in its simplest terms \u201cAfter Story\u201d is about people, relationships and of course growing up, and it does this in a very realistic, enjoyable and surprisingly insightful way without feeling forced. For the most part it felt genuine and sincere which is very rare in anime these days, with very few moments feeling contrived or too clich\u00e9. In fact this is one of the few anime`s that one could actually believe that the characters are real people and act as real people would in their situations, which was a big fucking surprise to me given that this is a sequel to Clannad, where people act like, well, fucking one dimensional video game characters.      \\n\\n\r\n\u201cAfter story\u201d basically builds upon Nagisa and Tomoya`s relationship, which starts with them just going out with each other and eventually growing into much bigger things and of course as these things happen and they get older all the challenges that they have to face along with all the amazing things that happen to them. Anyway Clannad After Story excels where Clannad failed miserably, namely in making you care and feel for the characters and in getting you emotionally involved,  which is basically what this anime is really about, getting the audience emotionally invested in the lives of these fictional characters more so than telling a story, which is fine, I enjoyed it a lot and it never felt boring or slow, which is is a great accomplishment given that this is very much a slice of live anime, proving once again that big fight scenes and special effects are no substitute for a good story and believable characters. I suppose you could say the story of \u201cAfter Story\u201d is without sounding too clich\u00e9, about life, and the challenges that all of us most one day face while we're alive. And for the most part After Story does this very well in a mature and realistic manner, even touching on subjects that many animes wouldn't dare touch such as child birth, being a parent, loneliness and loss. \\n\r\nAnd this is where this anime really shines with its realism and true life grittiness, sure it still has some of the cutesy elements left over from clannad but there used sparingly and appropriately and don't do the show much harm.  Really as far as story or plot goes there really isn't any and that fine because there doesn't need be because this is a story about life, belonging and growing up. Going into too much depth about this stuff exactly would just spoil things for others how haven't seen it yet which I don't like too do to people, unless their black... shit I mean, oh on, crap how do I delete thi....  \\n\\n\r\nAs far as sound goes in this series I was very impressed, there are some good pieces of music here that really help to set the mood and make you feel what's going on even more, however I have one complaint and that's that for the first \u00be of the show any-time the anime wants us to feel very emotional they play the same piece of music again and again. It got to the point where I was rolling my eyes every-time it stared thinking \u201coh God not again, I GET IT! IM SUPPOSED TO FEEL SAD, THANK YOU!   \\n\\n\r\nOne of the smartest changes \u201cAfter Story\u201d made was keeping most of the other characters from Clannad out of this series or at least subdued, the reason for this is because they just wouldn't work in this new realistic, gritty setting. And that's the reason this series is so good, because its not filled with so many cardboard cut out characters there simply to give viewers a boner or as comedy relief, sure their there a bit but its subdued and doesn't get in the way of the story, you know what gets in the way of the story though, my inability to see light or hear sounds.... to help me please donate money too www.thisisdefiantlynotascam.co.fuckyousucker\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with this show I thought was the fantasy elements in it, I don't want to spoil things for some people but I thought this show was at its best when it was dealing with real world issues such as growing up, finding a job, loss etc. and that the whole other worlds thing was utterly pointless and took away from the show. The girl and robot scenes were there for no other reason than try to create a mystery, tug at our hearts with expository dialogue that just felt forced and ultimately give an ending that made no sense and as an excuse for some 3d art which just looked awkward.  Really this show felt smarter or beyond having to use stupid things like magic or whatever to tell this story, and it messed with the tone at times like when serious things are happening and then it cuts to the robot and that girl and im like \u201cwhat the fuck, go back! I don't give a shit about this robot or whatever the hell hes doing, because hes never been established, if I don't know who or what he is I wont care and so its boring.\u201d There where also a few other bad scenes were I was thinking, \u201cpeople don't act like that in real life\u201d or \u201cthis makes no sense\u201d but that okay and understandable I mean its an anime with cute girls and fucking robots and other worlds in it, its not fucking Citizen Kane or the Godfather or Casablanca and when you understand that you can enjoy this series for what it is, and I enjoyed this series a lot.       \\n\\n\r\nAnyway to sum up I really was surprised and enjoyed this series more that I ever thought I would, sure there some annoying things and shit that made no sense but those aren't really problems for what this series was trying to do, namely grab your heart and get you emotionally involved which it does splendidly. If your into slice of life then is a must see and even if your not, unless your a nit picking ass-hole or just one of those people that thinks anything popular is overrated and stupid then you will certainly enjoy this, unless your black, I mean shit I did it again oh no fuc........",

            "content": "There come's a time in our lives where we see something that can just change our lives, whether we change our personality to changing the way we see life. And it can be from something as great as an original story to something that had been used many times but only changed something that can hit you right in the core. This is what I felt like when I saw Clannad: After Story\r\nStory is a continuation of the 1st season of Clannad, where it ends Tomoya and Nagisa finally being a couple. And it literally starts right there. Now that there near the end oftheir high school the wonder what's there to do now and what future are they willing to make. While doing so they pretty much do the same thing as the 1st season. At least the first half of Clannad where they meet a girl and they solve her problem. The second half is where instead of having everyone in the picture, it's more about the main couple. This is where it really pushes away and becomes something completely different. People might complain about the pace (being very slow sometimes) but I think that's the best part about it, it slow time down so you can feel like you're growing up with them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I will admit, I cried. Boy did I cry. This anime broke me down, just when I thought that I have no soul. And you know what? I'm kinda glad that happened to me. I've seen a few other \"tear jerker\" anime like \"Angel Beats!, Anohana, Kanon (2006) etc. and yet none of them has ever reached as far as what Clannad: After Story did.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is great there as always, having a few songs from the previous season there. One of the songs will make you remember and it might hurt you.\\n\\n\r\nThe downside as many people have mention is the forced sad moments they have. I can see why they would dislike it and I can agree to some extent that sometimes they do. But I accept it either way.\\n\r\nThe other is the ending, which honestly surprises me. Whether they call it a cop-out or confusing. The answer was in front of you since season 1. And you don't have to have any knowledge of the visual novel it was based on to understand it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is not only of one of my favorite anime of all time, but also one of the greatest thing I've seen in my life",

It turned out to be one of my top animes.\r\nStory - 10/10  Clannad was one thing, After story was another.  The story is... SAD, it made me cry like a baby, but then it has funny and really heartwarming scenes that cheered me up.  I loved this anime so so so much.  The plot really connects at the end, and the story is reallynice and definitely worth looking into.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10  I'm actually not a fan of this type of bug eyed art, but the shading and coloring is done really detailed and pretty looking, and the art wasn't disturbing and it was bearable.  It took a while to get used to, but once I did, I thought it was really beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10  Oh god, I would give this 100/10 lol!  The music is so... fitting to the mood.....  Some soundtracks are so cheerful and light hearted, and some are so tragic yet beautiful, and followed by that are soundtracks that are.... hopeful you can say?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7/10  I hate to give the character part a 7/10, but here's my reasons.  Tomoya isn't like your normal harem protagonist, I'll give you that, and he isn't a Gary Stu either, but the problem lies within the other characters.   First off, this anime contains several common Harem anime/game traits.  \\n\r\n1.  School Life    \\n\r\n2.  A guy friend for the main character, but he doesn't get any girls (Sunohara)\\n\r\n3.  A tsundere (Kyou)  \\n\r\n4.  A shy girl (Ryou)  \\n\r\n5.  A girl next door type of girl (Nagisa)\\n\r\n6.  A Loli (Mei)\\n\r\n7.  A violent girl (Tomoyo) \\n\r\n8.  A bookworm (Kotomi) \\n\r\netc etc...\\n\r\nKyou is like your average Tsundere, Nagisa is your common almost Mary Stu, and the girls seem so...  weak... (except for Tomoyo and Kyou) I know Japan likes their girls \"innocent\" but it just bugs me...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10  It's sad, funny, heartwarming...  kept me wanting to watch the next episode...\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10  Maybe... a 9/10, but I gave it a 10/10 already so a 10/10 xD",

            "content": "*Zels short personal Review*\r\nA fantastic show, packed full of drama and beautiful characters. I've never seen a series, where I admittedly teared or choked that much on one show. Simply beautiful, although it wasn't like that to begin with.\r\nThe first few episodes weren't really needed. Misaes and Meis arc felt tacked on, and rushed. Misaes arc felt like a rip-off, of a certain Kanon arc, except condensed into two episodes, also Meis arc was an over dramatised brother complex arc, though it was far more enjoyable then Misaes arc. It wasn't the best start, and not what I had hoped for, considering it was oneof the reasons why I wasn't too fond of the first season, when they covered filler characters, rather than our main protagonist. When they did cover our budding couple though, what an emotional ride it was and the only way was up from there.\\n\\n\r\nThe show had a much improved character development between Tomoya and Nagisa, and they truly looked like a believable loving couple and it was enjoyable to see them both get through in life. When the shit hit the fan, I truly felt for Tomoya, in having to deal with Nagisa as well as Ushio and his father. These were some of the saddest episode I've seen in an anime, and KyoAni did a great job in combining consistent animation and brilliant background music to help retain the mood. The supporting characters were better implemented this time round, with Nagias parents and the rest of the other characters actually supporting the young couple, rather than take the spot light, like the first season.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the first season, as the theories and the truth comes into fruitarian, about how it's linked to After Story, they could have done with explaining the ending a bit better. They could have easily scarified Misae and maybe even Meis arc, to help develop the ending. If they would have done that, this show would have hit perfect for me. I still feel that this show could have been done in one season, and still have been great. First season was effectively a power up collecting show, while After Story was what I had hoped for, and that's focus on the 'Clannad' story like movie had done. So overall a fantastic show which could have been perfect, but it wasn't to be. Still a must watch though.",

            "content": "Honestly...The series isn't my usual cup of tea. But, the 2nd season did catch me by surprise.\r\nSeason 1, which had a rather sad dramatic approach along with the usual boy-girl:misunderstandings, one-sided hidden feelings ,a lot of blushing and a bunch of harem, which all had shifted for the better(i guess) in the 2nd season. Unlike its prequel, Clannd After Story has put up a more depressing approach and packs in a few punch.\r\nBTW, when i said 'punch', what i really meant to say was-  a lot of crying, hugging, holding hands ,eye filing flashbacks (any more and i'll throw up. so i'll just addan etc) etc.\\n\\n\r\nStory-10/10\\n\r\nThe plot is really interesting. But the story gets going after the 1st 8 or 10 episodes. The series is able to give a few light-hearted laughs and heavy hearted cries being very depressing and emotional from the start itself. But, that is the very fact that makes the plot almost gripping. \\n\\n\r\nArt-10/10\\n\r\nA beautiful(hate saying the word) way to visualize the characters could have never been better. The perfect setting indeed for the anime with a lot of cute girls and people with big-round-flashy-colorful eyes(it creeps me out at times).\\n\\n\r\nSound-8/10\\n\r\nAs far as i've heard the soundtrack, the OP and ED music are not that special. But with the exception for these two, all the others are excellent. And it would feel as if you want to experience something from it and know what it is to feel and understand it. And my personal favourite is 'Roaring Tides'.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-9/10\\n\r\nIt series takes off with nothing special with the characters. But, after at least 8 or so episodes, there really is a major character development taking place , especially for the MC. Finding out he was wrong, and searching for what was right, all these questions act as a basis for the development in this story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9/10\\n\r\nFor those who are interested in light and sentimental anime... this is the one for you. Also, this is a must watch to those who feel like ''I need a recess from all there hard, violent and action genre\". It surely is a mood changer and a must watch for ladies.(Men....not so much)\\n",

            "content": "***Do not read this if you have not watched the prequel, Clannad***\r\nHonestly you can just skip this review if you want to. I know there are tons of reviews of Clannad After Story and a 10/10 rating is nothing new for one of the highest rated shows on MAL, but, after watching Clannad After Story for the third time, I just felt like I needed to do this. As the sixth anime I watched after really getting into anime a little over a year ago and my favorite anime for a long time, Clannad After Story is very special to me and something I hardlygo a week or two without thinking about at least once.\\n\\n\r\nThe best way I can think to describe this show in a few words would be \u201ctraumatic and life-changing.\u201d Clannad After Story is renowned as one of the saddest anime created so far by many people, and is, to date, the only thing I have watched of any medium (anime or not) since I was a little kid watching \u201cThe Tigger Movie\u201d that has ever made me cry. Not only that, but it has succeeded at doing so all three times that I have watched it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat Clannad After Story is famous for is being one of the few romance anime to go beyond where most romantic tales end. The first season of Clannad ends with Tomoya confessing to Nagisa and the two of them becoming a couple. This is where most romance stories end, but Clannad goes beyond that and, while it is mostly the same as the first season for the first 8 episodes, it soon moves on and explores further into the lives of our protagonists and the trials and tribulations that come with life, romance, and family.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this show does have a good amount of comedy, it separates it very well from the heartwarming and heartbreaking drama that Clannad After Story is truly known for. The drama of the first season does not even compare to the amount of emotions that this show conveys perfectly to the viewer.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Clannad After Story continues the high school lives of Okazaki Tomoya, Furukawa Nagisa, and everyone else that they met and became friends with in the first season. For the first eight episodes, it focuses on several short 2-3 episode arcs about three of the minor characters who did not receive arcs in the first season. These are nice in their own way (and the last one about Yukine has one of my favorite endings of any of the arcs in Clannad minus the longer After Story arc), but the real story, and where it begins to become something unique in anime, begins in Episode 9.\\n\\n\r\nThen the show quickly turns a 180 from being a shounen romance about a high school boy helping his friends solve their problems and helping Nagisa make friends, to a seinen romance about a \u201ckid trying to act like an adult\u201d (to paraphrase Yoshino Yusuke) who is trying to figure out where his life is going as his relationship with his girlfriend develops.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, the amount of character development that Tomoya goes through during these 22 episodes is phenomenal. I believe he is the most developed anime character I have ever seen and rightfully earns a spot high on my favorite characters list. At the beginning of the first season of Clannad, Tomoya was just a delinquent with a couple friends who hated his father and hated the town he lived in. After meeting Nagisa and changing her life while changing his own in the process, he eventually ended up where he is at the beginning of After Story. But even with all of that development, Tomoya develops much, much further during After Story (specifically after Episode 16).\\n\\n\r\nNagisa, who was hardly more important than the other leading females in the first season, is now in the spotlight along with Tomoya. As tough as Tomoya has it during this season, life is much harder on Nagisa. She keeps getting sick and missing school, but she still manages to keep their relationship strong and helps Tomoya succeed as he struggles to get his life started. The After Story arc (basically Episode 9 to the end) focuses on Nagisa, and she really makes this show one of the best there is.\\n\\n\r\nAkio and Sanae Furukawa also step up their roles during this season. Personally I think Akio is possibly the best anime father there is and one of the best parents I\u2019ve ever seen in general. The only thing against him is that taking pictures of your daughter at work disguised as a rapper is more than a little weird. Akio and Sanae help Tomoya and Nagisa start their lives and, aside from Yoshino, are really the only returning characters from the first season who have larger roles in the second season as everyone else goes their separate ways with only occasional appearances after Episode 9.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow for the art, which I know is what turns many people away from this show. Personally I love the character designs in Clannad, but I know many people dislike the large \u201cmoe\u201d eyes that are a standard in Kyoto Animation shows.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the character designs, the backgrounds and scenery of the small town Hikarizaka that the characters live in looks amazing to me. It\u2019s a big step up one year after the first season. The Hidden World also looks stunning with a combination of 3D for the mechanical doll and machinery and 2D for everything else.\\n\\n\r\nWith the drama and emotional scenes also comes amazing artwork. Often different colors are used for these scenes and the lighting effects work really well to compliment this. The elements of rain and snow are commonly used to intensify the emotion of the scenes. Whether it\u2019s fighting for something with everything you\u2019ve got or the extreme feelings of loneliness and hopelessness, the scenery in Clannad After Story compliments everything spectacularly.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in Clannad (as with most Kyoto Animation and/or Key visual novel anime) is one of the best there is. Whether it\u2019s the childish yet emotional \u201cBig Family Dango\u201d theme song or the dramatic \u201cTown, Flow of Time, People,\u201d the soundtrack is nearly flawless with almost every single song (whether lighthearted or emotional) standing out. The only song I dislike, called \u201cAna,\u201d is one that plays during Episode 20 which butchers the English language so badly that I have no idea what they are even trying to say. It kind of ruins the mood of one part of that episode, but since it is only played once, really does not hinder the show\u2019s overall soundtrack very much.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the soundtrack doesn\u2019t miss a beat. The Japanese voice actors are also very good (I won\u2019t say anything about choosing English or Japanese because if you\u2019ve already watched one season, then changing would be difficult), but I just really love the emotions that characters (especially Tomoya, have I mentioned how much I love Tomoya yet?) show. Everyone sounds the part perfectly, and even Sunohara gets some good emotional moments.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall \u2013 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend to anyone who has watched the first season of Clannad to watch Clannad After Story. If you haven\u2019t watched the first season and are reading this for some reason, then definitely watch the first season of Clannad. Without it, you won\u2019t be as emotionally attached to the characters and the dramatic scenes will have a much smaller (and less heart-wrenchingly emotional) impact. Similar shows would be Ef: a Tale of Memories, AnoHana, and Chuunibyou, though none of those are quite as emotional as Clannad After Story.\\n\\n\r\nBut then again, I don\u2019t believe there is any show, movie, or anything else that currently exists that is as emotional as Clannad After Story. It is a masterpiece which goes where most romance stories do not dare go. It has amazing characters with tons of development, an amazing soundtrack, good art as long as the big beautiful eyes do not bother you, and it ties everything together with its amazingly crafted unique story. Clannad After Story will forever be one of my favorite anime and the anime I feel the most nostalgia for. I\u2019ve watched it three times already, and there is no doubt in my mind that I will watch it again.",

            "content": "I never go into a sequel thinking anything highly, that is for sure. Of all the series, tv shows, and movies I have seen, I am usually completely let down. However, with Clannad the situation was different. After playing the Visual Novel, and after seeing the well done first season, my expectations for the sequel were very high and needless to say I was scared. Now, looking back on it, I have no idea why.\r\nThe story takes place directly after the first season, continuing with Tomoya's relationship with Nagisa. The drama seemed to be turned to 11, because it carried a completely different atmosphere. Thefirst half consisted of back stories for some supporting characters, which were nice and dramatic but weren't really needed. However, the second half kicked the story into gear, and Tomoya and Nagisa's relationship really began. And believe me, it is a journey filled with smiles and tears and is truly something you will never forget watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe art to a step up as well. The CGI scenes were more plentiful, and the actual art for regular scenes was simply brilliant. I can't really describe it in any other way.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you read my review for the first season, you may be confused what could be different, so let me explain. For this season, not only did they keep the brilliant soundtrack, but this time around they matched with the scenes phenomenally. Scenes that would normally just be kind of touching are turned into something truly breathtaking with the help of the music (remember graduation scene). The OP is gorgeous as well, setting the mood beautifully. HOWEVER, even though it isn't a really big deal, the ED is one of the biggest mood killers ever. So, if there's one criticism I have, its that, but with everything done so masterfully, I can deal with one goof up.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the same, with some being explained more and some having a bigger part. It could only go up from my last review.\\n\\n\r\nThe series was breathtaking to watch. Never before has a series moved me in a way Clannad AS did, and I have been frantically searching for another series to do it for me (Angel Beats has been the closest). It broke many beliefs I had, such as thinking only deaths can make me cry. While deaths are always sad in anime, Clannad AS shows me something different. Without spoiling anything, Clannad AS contains one of, if not the, most moving and emotional scene in all of anime (remember the field scene). This proved to me that Clannad AS has a masterful control over the viewers emotions, and honestly I wouldn't want it any other way. Now, I realize (again, no spoiling) that the end has been ridiculed ALOT, and I can sympathize. However, I am ok with it for two reasons. 1. I read the Visual Novel, so I knew what was going on. 2. The ending was necessary. Some people can only take so much heartache. With that said, I believe Clannad AS is nothing short of a masterpiece, and is how all dramas should be done.",

            "content": "I have never experienced such an emotional deep and moving story in any form of media as I did when I watched no book, anime, TV show, movie play etc has ever moved me like Clannad after Story, and it will forever be one of my favourite anime series. It has taken me a long time to write this review as whenever I recall the series I find myself on the verge of tears.\r\nStory 10\r\nThis is arguably the best story in any anime I have ever watched and it spanned the full spectrum of emotions I laughed, I cried, I was angry, I was sadthis anime will move you in ways that you didn\u2019t think you could be moved by any form of media. After Story\u2019s plot is far deeper and a more emotional story than most anime writers are brave enough to go. The story picks up where the prequel left off with the main characters still at high school and then proceeds to cove the next ten years of their life with a heavy focus on the two mains in the second half of the anime while the first half of the story explores the relationships that we never really got to see in the prequel. Each story is deep and bittersweet yet you feel happy at the each story. The most emotional scenes of the series happen in the last half of the story and while the overall emotion is a dark cloud of sadness rays of happiness and hope shine through and make you feel for the characters and what they are going through. What really moves you about this story is that for the most part it is a story that could and probably has happened in real life, I truly enjoyed this story more than any anime I have ever watched.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10\\n\r\nThe art was beautifully done the characters and landscapes were perfectly done every scene was intricate and detailed, the animaters did an excellent job they each character was done in excellent detail every scene was beautiful especially the snow and cherry blossom scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10\\n\r\nThe music was very well done the songs suited each scene perfectly the intro and outro were great and the BGM was supported the scenes adding to the emotional atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10\\n\r\nI loved each character in this series I could not fault any of the mains or the supporting they all were unique and interesting each had their own story and added to the overall story. Their development was incredible, one of this series strong points and you could relate to all of the characters and you felt for all of them. The personalities of the characters were excellent and I found myself liking all of the characters, I could find at least one good point in each character and more than one for most. Overall I really liked each of the supporting characters and loved the mains.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\r\nI truly enjoyed this anime more so than any anime I have watched in the past and it will remain the most emotionally impacting anime I will most likely ever watch, I cannot express properly how much I liked this anime in words it is something you simply have to watch yourself and be moved by, though I will continue to re-watch this series many more times and I don\u2019t think I will ever  get sick of it nor will I ever stop being moved by it.\\n\r\nOverall 10\\n\r\nThis is an anime you simply have to watch to understand just how emotionally heavy it is, I would recommend this to everyone (if you\u2019re a crier watch out as you will ball your eyes out for most of the series) it is a series that everyone can enjoy and feel for as is covers the issues that arise with high school and then growing up and becoming part of the adult world and how harsh life can be this is the first (and most likely only) anime that I will give a score of 10 across the board. I enjoyed it thoroughly.  \\n",

            "content": "This anime is one of my all-time favorites.  It is an anime that I would put on the same level or even higher than an older masterpiece like Cowboy Bebop.  Sure, the two may not be similar very much at all, but this show definitely deserves the title of masterpiece just as Cowboy Bebop attained that title.  The sound is fantastic and hits you when the feels are extremely high.  The dubbing in this was great in my opinion (except for maybe the casting of Kyou, but she isn't very crucial except for her one Another World episode).  The Keyart style is great for this story and it just looks wonderful especially at some of the most tragic parts.  The characters are well flushed out and they even get into developing the comedy relief (Sunohara), which is something you don't get to see too often.  I enjoyed it immensely, as can be seen through my previous statement that is one of my all-time favorites.  I cannot sing its praises enough, and for that, it deserves a perfect 10/10.",

            "content": "ahh first review.. SPOILERS AHEAD. SPOILERS AHEAD SPOILERS AHEAD. \r\n... \r\ndon't say i didn't warn you. \r\nfirst off, if you have not watched Clannad, you need to watch that before you ever start Clannad AS. in my opinion, Clannad is a very average anime (7-7.5/10 at best), but the background information in Clannad is crucial to AS. That being said, if you watched Clannad, you shouldn't hesitate to watch clannad AS. AS and Clannad shouldn't be looked upon as separate series -- but a continuous one. \r\nSTORY (8.5/10) \r\nMostly because I have problems with the ending -- i felt that it was placed mostly tomake all the Clannad fans happy than to deliver a good story. Because the ending was too happy, too surreal, I think the impact of the message (which I believed was along the lines of family, finding what you want to protect and changing your own fate) that Clannad attempted to make significantly decreased. On top of it, there are a lot of cliche quotes/scenes. In some scenes I was able to guess what the characters would say long before they did and almost to the point. However, at the same time, I can never slander Clannad for its cliche plot because it delivers it with an amazing emotional intensity. And I truly believe that it is this emotional appeal that makes Clannad AS so loved by many fans and allows the critics to overlook its cliche storyline. It makes you really feel from the bottom of your heart what it means to love someone. what it means to be a parent. what it means to care for others. what it means to live. At the end of the day, this anime makes you think. Laugh. Weep and Sigh with contentment. For its versatility of emotions that it was able to carry in mere 24 episodes (technically 22), I applaud it. (I would say emotional component alone was 9.5-10/10) \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10) \\n\r\nI had no huge problems with the art other than the fact that all the girls seemed to look alike (aside from their hair color). it bugged me -- a little. But not much. \\n\\n\r\nMusic (10/10) \\n\r\nfantastic soundtrack. i downloaded all of them. the serene/mellow tracks are definitely my favorite. Listening to the tracks makes me remember certain scenes -- which indicates just how powerful of a tool music is in Clannad. I really believe that in certain scenes, it was the music that carried the mood more than the story. Also, the Dango song is integrated into the plot and becomes a symbol for Nagisa -- which was I thought an interesting way to incorporate music with the anime. It made it seem that without music, a piece of this animation would be missing -- brilliant. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10) \\n\r\nI loved. Loved. Loved. Tomoya\u2019s character development. But I felt that Nagisa remained rather static. Actually, I felt that her personality was flat in Clannad compared to the other characters, but I saw that she did at least improve a little. But in Clannad AS, she is hardly seen and hardly grows. She is just an emotional pillar that Tomoya learns to lean on when he needs help. I wish that her character was developed with tomoya because it would have brought their already close relationship to an even more stellar level. However, I think that Tomoya\u2019s character growth was suddenly stunted by the way that the Clannad writers chose to do the end. I wish there were more scenes with Ushio and Tomoya. Ushio is the cutest, most loveable character I have ever encountered in an anime. She\u2019s a mature but cute kid that anyone sane enough would \u201cawwww\u201d and would like to adopt :]. Basically, I love her. It was a shame that the story focuses purely on Tomoya and Nagisa (although I did prefer it since the story was given a better focus) becase it sacrificed the huge number of character cast that Clannad boasted before. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) \\n\\n\r\nOverall (8.3/10) \\n\r\n while I didn\u2019t bawl at any point in the series, I did have moments where I had goosebumps and when I just felt a part of my heart shatter looking at their tears (helloooooo episode 18 -- an episode I've watched countless, countless of times. It's my favorite episode by miles and miles. It\u2019s one of the major reasons why I think this anime is gold). It has an amazing emotional component that easily out does many, many of the same animes in its genre. I could definitely hail Clannad AS as one of the greatest romantic animes of its time, and although the Clannad series on the whole (including original Clannad) has its bumps and flaws, I\u2019m glad I finished it up until the very end.",

            "content": "[This review probably contains spoilers, probably is too lengthy, probably is too personal and probably goes off on a tangent you weren't interested in. ]\r\n\"It's OK now. You did well. Now it's your turn to cry.\" -- Akio to Sanae\r\n\"It looks like I finished things without even realizing it.\" -- Tomoya's father\r\nClannad Afterstory is universally recognized as a show that can and will make many (most) viewers tear up, or even start bawling. \r\nWhile many people are touched, or even moved, by the tragedy and heartbreak, a fair portion of reviewers see a relatively average romantic-comedy-slice-of-life show being elevated by blatantly drawing on viewers tearducts, making viewers forget that they watched 40 episodes of , in some people's opinions, mediocrity to get to this point. \\n\\n\r\nI'd like to argue that Clannad Afterstory has an underlying theme which is far more important than wet eyeballs and drama: what it truly means to be a parent, and to forgive a parent.\\n\\n\r\nIt's common knowledge that parents are generally absent from anime. Between boarding schools, orphans, and parents with bizarre work schedules, the only time we typically see parents is as a form of comic relief.   This could be due to the younger audience, or it could just be because parents are hard characters to get right. \\n\\n\r\nClannad gets parents right. They are human beings, not disciplinary robots who dispense useless platitudes, and they have numerous, numerous faults. At the same time, they aren't these appalling monsters who revile their children and regret ever having them (another anime trope...). They suffer, they cry, they falter, but despite flaws they care about their children and go to great lengths to support them. This is how most parents exist in the real world. Instead of ignoring the parent-child relationship, Clannad Afterstory explores it in depth and uses family as the strength necessary for the characters to persevere through tragedy. \\n\\n\r\nWith the faults and strengths of the parents naturally comes the concept of forgiveness. There are many things in Clannad that are forgiven. In other anime, Tomoya might continue hating his father to the end. Akio and Sanae may never forgive Nagisa for halting their dreams. Akio, Sanae, and Ushio might always view Tomoya as the deadbeat who walked out on his child. And Tomoya might never forgive himself. \\n\\n\r\nClannad does forgive these characters, and in doing so tries to tell you to do so as well. In the end, their lives are easier and more complete because they are able to forgive. \\n\\n\r\nClannad Afterstory isn't just about crying at loss. The two scenes that touched me the most aren't the two most tragic, but rather the two I quoted at the start. Those scenes helped remind me the sacrifices my mother made, and to forgive my mother for some of the things she has done. \\n\\n\r\nAnd if I have to watch 40 episodes of melancholic slice-of-life to remember that, despite her faults, my mother's love is what truly matters, well it's damn well worth it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

This anime made me realize a lot about my life from my flaws to my mistakes and realization of what I should do from now on. \r\nAnyways, onto the review. This series differentiate itself from the first series since it's more on the serious side of things instead of just focusing on the comical side. I do recommend watching the first series so you can get a feel of what each character is like and what each person's problems were. The only thing that frustrated me was the confusing ending. But afterrewatching it I realized what I think the ending was. I think they left the ending a little open ended but viewers can make up what the ending was like to themselves. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nI love this story from Clannad to AS. It was very well done and the transitioning from one situation to another was smooth. Everything that was watched some how shows a bit of itself at the end and they connected all the things from even the first series. The story itself was very easy to follow and understand. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nMy favorite would be the eyes. Key animation, I applause you. The emotions shown through the eyes was very well done. From the sadness to happiness I can see and sense the emotion right away. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\r\nI love the opening of this anime. The song fits perfectly into the storyline. The bad part was  ending song. That song kills the mood every time. Right when you feel the sadness and the episode ends, this happy theme song comes up and it instantly kills the mood. Aside from that everything was perfect. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nAll the characters themselves were each very unique. No matter how little the difference every single one of them had something that stood out. Tomoya and Nagisa are both currently my favorite characters. Just love that pair ^.^\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 \\n\r\nThis anime had me hooked ever since the first episode. I enjoyed all the comedy they put into it and also all the sad scenes is just heart touching. This story doesn't really make viewers go into an emotional roller coaster. When they set the mood, that is what you will be feeling and the split each emotions well so you don't have the moments where your happy and instantly the next moment your sad. (except the ending theme song of course).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nBest anime in my opnion...speechless :)\\n\\n\r\nThis was my first review, hope I didn't do too terrible. Really loved this anime :)",

            "content": "Slice of Life and Drama animes are ones I don't generally like. I'm more of the action, comedy with a hint of romance anime lover, but Clannad: After Story changed that for me! (I recommend watching Clannad before watching this anime...)  Clannad: After Story will definitely become one of your favorite animes because it certainly became one of mine. For starters, I'd just like to say that I usually NEVER cry while watching a movie, anime, book or show of any sort. Clannad: After Story was different though, it did in fact make me tear up, especially towards episode 18 and up. So here'show I scored each element of the anime:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 \\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\\n\r\nNow I shall go ahead and give you the reasons as to why these areas were scored the way they were! :) I tried not to put any spoilers in this review, but I still would read with caution because hints of the upcoming event are given...\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\nThis is definitely the most important part of an anime for me. If the story isn't good, the whole thing kinda fails, same goes with the characters. The story does run a bit slow at times, but to be fair, it is a 'slice of life' type anime and life doesn't always go all over the place in full speed. The story picks right up from Clannad, which makes me very happy because we get to see the main characters gradually grow more mature and eventually get married and so on... The story also has many situations and areas where everyone can relate to, giving it a strong connection with the viewers. The father-son (Tomoya and his father) and father-daughter (Tomoya and his daughter) relationship was a big point in the story. The way they showed another side of Tomoya's father through flashbacks and such, showed a new side to the man that many might have thought mean, cold and selfish during Clannad. This made me really happy and made the anime more realistic, showing that a person's heart isn't fully rock solid. WARNING: Clannad: After Story plays with your emotions, causing you to feel very sad and sympathetic or empathetic! \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI'm not too prickly about my art preference, but I ended up scoring Clannad: After Story an 9 because I generally like more realistic looking characters... I guess? Maybe characters without such big eyes...but, the backgrounds were beautiful, I especially loved the parts where it goes to a different world where the girl lives all alone with the light orbs. :)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nDango, dango, dango, dango.... that song makes me smile every time I here it  now!Oh, Nagisa! I really liked how a more mellow song was chosen for the opening to kind of set the mood, but then the closing song is more upbeat, which uplifts my spirited after a heavily heart tearing episode. The sound tracks were great! \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nLike I said in my little Story scoring blurb, the characters are important! Clannad: After Story did not fail me on that! The characters were all pretty much developed because of Clannad, but they managed to develop them EVEN MORE! Again, like I had said on my Story scoring paragraph, Tomoyo's father was more explored and the reasons for the way he was acting are revealed, causing you to feel different emotions toward him than of those you felt during Clannad. Nagisa is still her stubborn, lovable self. Her mom is still the supportive woman she is, and Nagisa's father, likewise, is still as comedic and awesome as usual...Tomoya on the other hand...reacts the way many human beings might after facing a huge set back in his life, causing him to feel very depressed and...lonely...Anywho! You'll love the characters!The anime gets you to become attached to these characters, making it EVEN MORE sad and hurtful to the heart when something goes wrong for them...and on the other hand, when something amazingly happy happens to them, you'll feel that warmth in your heart as well!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI loved, loved, loved every second of this anime! I cried, I smiled, I laughed, I was given many different facial expressions throughout this anime! I enjoyed it very much! Episodes 18 and up were the ones I liked the most! \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nIt's just an all around great anime! I really recommend people to watch Clannad: After Story!  \\n",

The art style and first slice-of-life ish half of clannad made it come across as a casual series and hard to empathise with any of the characters. You'd watch the series and think to yourself \"they wouldn't actually kill off any of the characters\", and you'd be absolutely right. Also, it was next to impossible to have any sort of investment in the characters that did (for some time) die. Nagisawas annoying to say the least and Shio had way too little screen time.\\n\\n\r\nArt 4\\n\r\nArt honestly looks like crap. Animation is smooth for only some parts, but the apalling design of half the characters is a throwback to a style one decade past. It honestly looks worse than much much older anime at times.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5\\n\r\nDid not notice any notable pieces, both openings and endings are just average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5\\n\r\nMost of the characters have the same problem. The side characters exist as elements of comic relief and items on the MC's people to help out list, it's pretty lame. Some are also downright annoying, you find it hard to imagine there being actual people like that. The MC was fine, realistic and relatable, but that's it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3\\n\r\nDid not enjoy this at all. Only redeeming part was probably the whole saga with his father.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 4\\n\r\nJust watch the OVA",

The charm of the series is the story it was full of sadness and heart break, but also some of the funniest moments in an anime i have ever watched. Without getting into too much detail this goes over the effects of season 1 (which you will need to watch to enjoy this anime) and the most amazing anime couple of all time. (although i did skip the episodes 4-8 because i heard they were boring af). Thecharacter, story, and enjoyment were far better than a number can describe, this anime left a lasting impact on me and my outlook on life. finally just like this review the ending was really damn confusing. I wish i could erase my memories just so i can go back and watch this anime for the first time again. PS I've been told rewatching it is a total mindfuck because you see everything that caused the ending unfold.",

            "content": "Clannad: The After Story is an absolute masterpiece. \r\nSo, why do I consider this one of the most beautiful stories not just in anime, but in the visual medium of entertainment in general?  Well firstly, this is absolutely the most beautiful show that I have ever seen.  The choreography and cinematography work in tandem with the setting and dialogue to elevate this show past anything I have ever seen before.  From the longer shots of our main protagonists walking through the town or having a stunning and emotional moment the writers know what to focus on visually.  Couple that with themost stunningly beautiful soundtrack to ever be created and you get an anime that takes \u201cshowing the story\u201d to a whole new level.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the characters are absolutely some of the most memorable and identifiable characters to ever be brought to film.  Okazaki is the embodiment of a young adult who is attempting to grow and find his place in life.  Nagisa is an absolute beauty, and her timid but extremely caring personality that drives most of the show is very well done.  The side cast of characters is brought back from the original Clannad, but in the After story, most of the show focuses on the newly created family bonds between Okazaki and Nagisa.  It is during these interactions that the writers create a lot of heavy emotion because the characters are so identifiable and realistic, and the situations that they are put in are also very identifiable.  These characters and their interactions are so well done and subtly beautiful that it builds the emotions throughout the show and creates massive amounts of heartbreak when the characters have to deal with the changes in their lives.  Finally, when it comes to characters, Ushio may just be the single best portrayal of a young child any show has ever created.  Her dialogue and her interactions with her family are so beautiful, funny, and emotionally tear-jerking that you can tell a massive amount of thought went into the careful construct of her character.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the overall theme of the show is about the struggles of adulthood, but also about how quickly things can change and be taken away.  The beginning half of the show is fantastic as we see arcs that carried over from the original Clannad conclude but the back half depicting the changes and extreme hardships that the characters must deal with was without a doubt one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking stories to ever be brought to the visual realm of entertainment (you have been warned).  These extreme hardships that last throughout the back half of the show had me in tears just about every few episodes, and as the emotion built to its very emotional and satisfying conclusion, it left me unable to stop reflecting on what I had just witnessed for nearly a month.  It has been over a year since I watched this show, and I still remember every single bit of beautiful and stunning screen time this show created.  \\n\\n\r\nThe combination of subtle beauty, extremely identifiable characters, relatable emotional struggles, and heartbreaking emotional sequences place this show in a league of its own.  Clannad: The After Story is simply a must watch for any anime fan.\\n",

            "content": "Clannad After Story picks up the narrative where it's less successful predecessor ends it. the play was performed, Tomoya makes important step; tears of joy, laughter of happiness; last year of school life begins and our noble self-deprecating bum Tomoya gets dragged in whirlpool of his (girl)friends problems and stories. \u201cBut this is exact copy of Clannad 1 (and, in fact, any other harem anime)\u201d, I exclaim silently to myself and droop my head in disenchantment. \u201cBut there must be something there!\u201d hopeful me whispers over my shoulder. \u201cOk, I\u2019ll give it another chance\u201d, I answer and dive into the kind naive world of Clannad.Thanks God/Science I took the leap.\\n\\n\r\n=====================================\\n\r\nAs I mentioned above, first half of series follows the ever present and over beaten template: innately good and selfless hero attracts an infinite cast of girl characters, each having a \u2018quest\u2019 which can only be resolved by altruistic sacrifice of the protagonist (and support of friends, of course). Though, as we are dealing with sequel, we have already conscripted familiar ensemble: moe queen Nagisa, best friend-clown Sunohara, professional tsundere Kyou and, forgive my laziness, about five or six other school characters that fall under same or other stereotypes. (The protagonist himself falls under regular cynical high schooler stereotype.) \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, implementation of said templates is decent. None of the supporting actors surprised me in any way but none caused a vomit ethier (by the way, praise the sun! Fuko is absent in After Story!!!). Should I mentioned the obvious fact that each of the characters is perfect kind being that lack any bad traits? I mean realistic bad traits and not the \u201cChrist, I can\u2019t even help 3475 people at once, I\u2019m worthless!\u201d ones. I hope that goes without saying.\\n\\n\r\nI do have some praise for characters though. Nagisa, despite being so so moe, is utterly cute and adorable so you can\u2019t help but feel felicity while watching her and listening to splendidly picked voice actress. I won\u2019t commend Sunohara himself but rather commend his mere presence a company. It gives at least a droplet realism to totally unrealistic situation where \u201cuseless outcast\u201d gets surrounded by three thousand cute girls. At least there are two males here. And\u2026 that's it about school characters praise.\\n\\n\r\nFirst half follows format of prequel where two-three episodes comprise an arc that regales us some incredibly genuine, kind, naive, breathtaking, heart-soothing story about happiness and sadness, values of love, friendship, family, dedication and diligence. I admit, they are good. But nothing more. As always,  Japanese are painting life problems in a *ideal* world which immediately renders them worthless in all aspects but one: aesthetic pleasure. But I do (not) complain. It\u2019s standart in anime. Just, specifically in Clannad After Story, I can\u2019t help but berate some ark moments: the \u2018evil\u2019 soccer team (like, come on, contrast in decency between Tomoya group and soccer team was so immense that it don\u2019t know how else to name other than idiotic; the only thing missing was evil laughter \u2018MU HAH HA\u2019 and we would have got typical japanese villain), gangs wars (\u2018noble bandits\u2019, yeah, totally realistic). But, as I said, the stories *are* entrancing. They leave you with aftertaste of joy, delight and, more often, gentle sadness. If you a romance lover, that is.\\n\\n\r\nIn any case, life goes on and after ten or so episodes Tomoya graduates school and becomes fully fledged grownup. And that\u2019s where Clannad After Story really begins and elevates above the throngs of mediocre animes, rightfully taking the title of second best slice of life series.\\n\\n\r\n=====================================\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard for me to pinpoint the greatness of this part, as objectively speaking, we are still presented with same ideal kind word where each problem is resolved by naive virtue known to any six year old. But that\u2019s the point, isn\u2019t it? Right way is simple and yet few can follow it. And so is Tomoya, who now enters adult life devoid of strong purpose and lacking experience. And thus begins his long journey of transformation from listless no one to earnest member of society. Yet life is known to be a bitch so this journey is filled tragedies and obstacles\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is probably what you\u2019ve been advertised of, am I right? \u201cThe legendary tragedy Clannad After Story\u201d. Well, if you haven\u2019t, than I say it. Indeed, the struggle of Tomoya\u2019s day to day existence won\u2019t leave unscathed even the most callous cynic. There can\u2019t be a touching story filled solely with happiness. Tomoya\u2019s tale isn\u2019t exception. There would be grieve\u2026 but with genuine effort and support of loved ones it\u2019ll turn into candid happiness. \\n\\n\r\nThe tune is old as pyramids yet Clannad portrayal is so sincere, so honest that it goes straight to the heart and keeps grip on it until very end. And, to be honest, it\u2019s still very naive, but at same time it is so *right*. It is so right that you can\u2019t help but look at yourself, wondering \u201cHow can I change for the better?\u201d. Yes, it\u2019s one of the few art pieces capable of changing outlook on life. Even if a little, it\u2019s still tremendous feat.\\n\\n\r\nConcerning narrative, we still have same storytelling arc format. But, as there is no school anymore, subjects are shifted towards more realistic daily problems such as work and family. Each event is supplemented with rich Tomoya\u2019s introspective. School friends fades into background which is, in fact, immensely positive change. Few characters I didn\u2019t mention before become prominent: Nagisa\u2019s parents, eccentric and absurdly young looking couple. They fit quite nicely to the story and deserve credit.\\n\\n\r\n=====================================\\n\r\nIn general, Clannad wins not with pure plot or writing but with directing and presentation. The drawing style seems mind blowing at first but quite quickly gets pleasant and casual (though shots with multiple faces still look ridiculous). Music matches perfectly to each situation; delicate magical feel of it readies your eyes to spurt a few tears at culmination of the arc. But what moves more than anything is sincere honesty of unfolding life which will surely resonate with your own.\\n\\n\r\nSchool Days: 5/10\\n\r\nAfter Story 10/10\\n\\n\r\nTotal: 7.5/10 ~ 8\\n",

            "content": "I don't normally write reviews but I felt like this anime touched my heart like none other so I feel obliged to give something back to it. \r\nFirstly I have watched the whole of clannad and afterstory in english dub first, then after I re-watched it in subtitles because I felt like I needed to experience both. Having known what happens from the Dub, I cried my eyes out the likes of which I didn't think was even possible for me throughout most of the Sub. I can wholly recommend watching this in its original form (Japanese) you will connect more emotionally with the charactersand i'm sure you will be balling your eyes out like me :'( .  \\n\r\nSadness aside, this anime was fantastic. If you are doubting whether to watch afterstory after the somewhat 'slow' clannad then don't hesitate, this is full of comedy, romance, heartache and brain aches from start to finish. Nagisa's father is just hilarious for me. \\n\r\nI really enjoyed the character development of the main protagonists, so many anime end with the confession or they date for a little bit, but this anime runs through dating, proposal, marriage and even giving birth to a child. It follows their normal daily lives around this also from day to day jobs and study or sport etc. \\n\r\nIm not going to give spoilers as I know some people hate them to death, but this is without a doubt the saddest thing you can watch. I cried in two episodes of clannad I think, but in this I cried ep after ep untill I had no more left. To me it is just so real and I really felt for the characters effected. That said, don't be disheartened ultimately there is a supernatural element this anime which I also liked as it was subtle and not in your face all the time, so you can rest easy that its not all heartache, doom and gloom. \\n\r\nOverall I can highly recommend this anime, and I think it is just one of those shows that every body should watch as it will change you as a person and make you connect with those feels you never thought you had. Even if you are a diehard, action, adventure, echi, dark, harem, shounen, fighting lover, I would still say just watch this and then tell me what is the most emotional thing you have watched, and I assure you it will be this. \\n\r\nThank you if you bothered reading feel free to message me :) x",

The first season might keep you interested, but all in all it is slightly generic, this however made me feel emotionally attatched, and I laughed, and I cried, and I loved every second of it.\r\nThe story is essentially what happenned after the \"happily ever after\" at the end of clannad. It mainly followsthe development of the realationship between tomoya and nagisa. I will say this, at a point it gets very depressing and the general air of sadness might make you want to quit watching, I know because it happenned to me, but you NEED to watch until the end and if you do, I promise that you wont be disapointed. \\n\\n\r\nI of couse will not say what is so sad, or on the flip side what is so wonderful because that would be the fastest way immaginable for me to spoil this. \\n\\n\r\nAs I said before the emotion running through me from this show was very powerful, I felt like I had experienced the happiness, saddness, hopelessness, redemption, and all the other emotions that were running through the characters (mainly tomoya) and this is not something that I say lightly. I didnt cry the day my dad left me forever, and I have never been able to express much(if any) emotion, so the fact that this show could make me cry so many times be it from something sad and painful, or something extremely beutiful is a testament to how great it is. \\n\\n\r\nThis is something that I am very happy that I was able to experience and I hope that you will watch it too!",

            "content": "Clannad AS, more than anything, is a story grounded in the humanity of its characters. It contains none of the heartbreaking romance, breathtaking action sequences, or mind-boggling mystery we see so often in the anime, or in general entertainment medium, yet manages to be even more tell a tale even more gripping than any other I\u2019ve seen. Clannad AS is both a complex and simplistic work, and personifies people; we witness people at their happiest, living to protect what only they can protect, and at their lowest, falling into a pit of despair and grief over the loss of loved ones. We see them changeas they meet new people and broaden their horizons, as they become optimistic about the world around them, yet down the road, regretful of these very changes as they bear the pain of loss. We see them gain, lose, re-gain, then lose again, in a cycle of hope and despair.\\n\\n\r\nAt the core of Clannad AS is the story of one man, who seems to have been abandoned to a hopeless fate, despising all and despised by all around him. His mother died young, leaving him with his drunken, abusive father who shuns him after an accident that left him crippled. However, his pessimistic, hate-filled view of his surroundings changed when he met Nagisa, the woman who changed every aspect of his outlook and personal life. As he learns the hardship, yet ultimate joy that comes with the burden of protecting the one he loves, life suddenly becomes worth living. Yet it is the loss of his loved ones, his failure and inability to save the people he cared about, that sent him reeling back into his pool of self-fueled hate and grief. And through this black hole of pain, the shining light of hope, the last remainder of his love, was able to be his salvation.\\n\\n\r\nIt would seem that, from the premise, Clannad AS is simply a romantic story, a story of a happily married couple spending each day doing what they love. However, the story transforms into something much deeper than that, it explores the confines of what it means to be human. What does it mean to protect? What does it mean to love? Is love worth the pain that comes with loss? The human relationships depicted in the anime are extremely beautiful and touching, but above all they are realistic. Watching Clannad AS made me realize how amazing humans really are, that the strength of familial bonds and friendship can truly overcome any obstacles, whether it be grief, responsibility, or death. Indeed, the lines between fiction and reality blurred as I became absorbed into the realistic and heartfelt storytelling of Clannad AS.\\n\\n\r\nClannad AS is certainly a very sad anime, and you will see this stressed in many other reviews. However, it\u2019s not simply a tearjerker; the sadness has more depth than simple melodrama. What truly brought tears to my eyes was how touching and beautiful human relationships can be: a father who collects all the fragments of his shattered life to protect his daughter, a daughter who forgives and continues to love a father who abandoned her, a grandfather who sacrifices anything and everything to protect what he loves and believes in. For such a seemingly simplistic anime about the bonds of a few people, Clannad AS has an amazing depth. The magnitude of its depth is shown magnificently through the relationships and unbreakable bonds of family, through both the struggle and the happiness of its characters.\\n\\n",

            "content": "(I\u2019m just going to assume whoever reads this already finished the first season and knows the characters, but I\u2019ll try my best not to spoil anything from after story)\r\nStory:\r\nA direct continuation from its predecessor, Clannad, Clannad After Story (~AS~) continues and finishes Key\u2019s visual novel written by Maeda Jun. It is incredibly difficult to masterfully adapt a visual novel into an anime, so I must give my kudos to those who worked on it at Kyoto Animation. Ok now onto the brief synopsis.\r\nThe story picks up after Tomoya and Nagisa become your prototypical couple. With the sprouting of a new relationship come its own quirksand flaws within it. These two are no exception. Since the first season did not finish covering all of the side arcs, it made sure to do so at the beginning of the season. Following that, they decide to focus on the main storyline for the latter half of the story. Within each side-arc, there is a touching tale that results in tearjerkers for many. However, the beauty of the show is that it wasn\u2019t simply designed to make you cry for all 22 episodes. What this show exceeds at is playing with the entire spectrum of an individual\u2019s emotional set. A literal slice-of-life, ~AS~ puts the finishing touches of the story of a boy growing up and dealing with the highest highs and lowest lows of life. \\n\\n\r\nThe story doesn\u2019t lack in any thematic substance either. As many may know already, the title of the show, \u201cClannad,\u201d has a Gaelic root, \u201cClann\u201d (or \u201cChlann\u201d, thanks interwebs), which basically means family (particularly the descendants). Conveniently, family is the most emphasized theme in the entire show. As stated in the first season by Akio, the descendant\u2019s dreams become those of the ancestors. Do not forget that. ~AS~ plays on that idea beautifully, and as you continue to watch the show, everything will come together nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not much else I can say about the story other than it was executed well despite a deus ex machina of an ending. There are important lessons to be taken from each arc, and they often boast high sentimental value. Also, if you were wondering about the illusionary world business, don\u2019t worry. Most of your questions will be answered. Other than the lack of importance of previously important characters (ie: your Kotomis and Kyous; however, that can be easily forgiven because of execution and the fact that it\u2019s a visual novel adaptation), there is nothing much to complain about. As stated before, the story isn\u2019t something that can be easily described in words. Go experience it for yourself; chances are that you\u2019ll love it.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10 (An excellent experience with a few noticeable flaws)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nKyoto Animation have outdone themselves again in putting together ~AS~.  A huge overhaul from the first season, every fathomable visual aspect of the show has been touched up to near perfection. Character animation and design is polished throughout the series, and there are few blemishes as the story progresses. One aspect that Kyoani nailed specifically is the subtle progression of character aging. Although some malefactors exist (such as the seemingly ageless wonders Akio and Sanae), each character looks a tad different in order to compliment the fact that (minor spoiler) they are no longer high school students at a certain point. Overall, other than the fact that some people may not appreciate the humongous eyes each girl has (personally it bothered me at first, but I grew accustomed to it), the character design is solid.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters look great, the backgrounds look amazing. From the gloomy ambiance of the illusionary world to the blossoming sakura at the dawn of spring, Kyoani made sure that almost every little visual detail was absolutely immaculate. The atmosphere placement for certain situations were spot on, complementing the script with a sort of subtlety that is noticeable enough to be greatly appreciated. \\n\\n\r\n(minor spoiler paragraph upcoming)\\n\\n\r\nChange is another theme of ~AS~, and the visuals make sure to convey that to the audience. Nothing stays the same forever, and Kyoani does justice to the ever-changing surroundings. Places individuals may hold dear might not be there the next time they visit. Whether it\u2019s for better or for worse, it\u2019s a hard thing to deal with, and Kyoani uses the art to speak for itself.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the visual package of ~AS~ is just one of the many different factors that makes it unique. Boasting thoroughly top-notch visuals in even today\u2019s market coming from a show that was released 4 years ago, ~AS~ truly capitalizes on its opportunity to be a great eye-candy too (not in a perverse manner, in an atmospheric one).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nIt already takes a lot out of production when focus on story and art is so glorified that sometimes sound is left in the dust. ~AS~ has none of that. Composed by Maeda Jun, the Clannad soundtrack is that of potential greatness. Personally, a few of the songs in the soundtrack are among my favorites and bear a relative emotional impact. From the calming, reassuring tune of Nagisa\u2019s theme to the subtle tenseness of \u201cRoaring Tides\u201d, the entire soundtrack brilliantly complements the story and animation. Furthermore, Kyoani knew exactly what they were doing with soundtrack placement. The right track would be played at the right scene with the perfect timing; however, this often leads to the recycling of many tracks. Since ~AS~ uses nearly the same soundtrack as its predecessor, some of the variety is lost at times. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is as always great. I had no problems dealing with any of the supposed overly high-pitched voices, and when it came to emotions, the crew knew when to give it their all whether yelling or crying. I cannot emphasize enough how well Nakamura Yuuichi pulled off Tomoya\u2019s voice. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening, Toki wo Kizamu Uta (The Song that Ticks Away Time), is a piece that sounds great and has sentimental value. Sung by Lia and composed by Maeda Jun, the lyrics correlate with the context of the story. Additionally, Lia\u2019s performance of the song was brilliant; all of the correct emotions were poured into this piece, and I consider it to be one of the best opening songs and sequences of all time.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the same levels of expectations are not met from the ending, TORCH, also sung by Lia. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love the song. In fact, it\u2019s rather impossible for anything to go wrong when Lia is singing it; however, as many may know, the last thing anyone wants is a mood breaker. As the story progresses, emotional tension will skyrocket, and unfortunately, the overly upbeat tone of the instrumental itself is unnecessary. \\n\\n\r\nThere are two main insert songs in the series: Ana by Lia (used in Clannad before) and Chiisana te no hira by Riya (singer for Eufonius, who also sung Megumeru, the opening of Clannad). I\u2019ll let the songs do all of the talking when it comes to describing them, but there\u2019s one thing I can say about them: I absolutely love them. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n~AS~ follows the basic pattern of what a sequel is supposed to do: develop characters. The character cast is already relatively established and there\u2019s only one noticeable add-on. (quite a substantial one though) As we know by now, Tomoya and Nagisa are our couple of interest. This leads to the unfortunate, but required act of \u201ctossing aside\u201d some of the previously important characters. On the bright side, none of them are truly forgotten. Each and every character from the first season makes a return appearance and although their development is halted, it\u2019s a completely justified halt. Instead, what ~AS~ tends to focus on more is the unanswered characters. True to its visual novel status, there are three more arcs (4 if you want to count Yusuke\u2019s little rant) to cover before moving onto the main storyline. Within each arc, the characters (such as Yukine and the Sunoharas) are developed just as well as the others. Additionally, the way they tackle the mysterious girl and robot is magnificently executed too. Rather than focusing on them for whole episodes at a time, the familiar 2-5 minute scenes of their progression carry on smoothly and climax at the perfect time. \\n\\n\r\nNow we get to the main source of development: our little couple(Tomoya and Nagisa). There was no doubt all focus would eventually shift towards these two, but the style of execution turned something predictable into an emotional ride of a lifetime. Again, their relationship is anything but perfect. Development is driven by their struggles, and Tomoya\u2019s reactions complimented by Nagisa\u2019s steadfastness truly convey the ups and downs of a standard interpersonal relationship. However, theirs is a tad bit more special. As stated by Nagisa in the very beginning of the first season, the city plays a huge role throughout the show, so much so that it could be considered a character itself. The parallels drawn between the city, the couple, and everything else results in a marvelous depiction of a true drama.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the development of the most important characters are spot-on, the fact that some of the others had the opportunity to maybe play a relatively bigger role but didn\u2019t is a slight mishap (due to the fact so much emphasis was put on some other characters in the first season). However, despite these issues, I believe that in the end, the folks at Kyoani (and of course at Key) did the right thing in focusing on the couple in the end. The outcome couldn\u2019t have been more beautiful, and honestly, I wouldn\u2019t change much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nEnjoyment is often the most arbitrary of all categories, and there is no exception with ~AS~. To be painfully honest, it was slow paced at first. Although it stayed true to its source material, some of the arcs (like the sunoharas and dorm lady\u2019s) were rather unnecessary. I know that I am going to get a lot of hate from visual novel purists because of that, but it was those first 6 or 7 episodes that I found were pace breakers (albeit at the start of the season). However, I cannot deny that even though those episodes were slow paced, in the long run, it benefitted the series because it brought closure to a handful of characters, and you could argue it as an entertaining \u201ccalm before the storm.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the latter half of the story is where it really picks up. It almost seemed that I was assaulted with emotions at some point. I wanted to stop watching because of how emotionally stressing it was, but I couldn\u2019t find myself to stop at any point. To categorize emotional trauma as \u201cenjoyment\u201d sounds rather masochistic, but damn did I enjoy it when I look back. Overall, though, the series knows when you have to take a break (although it might overestimate some and underestimate others; that\u2019s why enjoyment is so arbitrary). There\u2019s no doubt that ~AS~ was one of the most \u201cenjoyable\u201d series to watch; however, I still cannot overlook the slow (yet arguably necessary) pacing of the first half-dozen episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nKyoto Animation succeeds in adapting one of the most popular visual novels in recent times. From amazing visuals to an enticing story complemented by a brilliant soundtrack, there are simply no gaping holes in the show. Although within each category there may be a minor gripe here or there, overall perfection is impossible. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.2/10  \\n",

            "content": "Personally my favorite all time anime. Why? (Umm... that means keep reading) It had a lot of foreshadowing and symbolism. If you watch and pay attention you will notice many things that constantly takes a pattern when a certain atmosphere is approached in the anime.\r\nStory (9/10):\r\nIf you're wondering why my ratings for the second season is lower than the first, it truly is bias. First to start off, it took Slice of Life and some how twisted it to Fantasy. It really made me mad that they had inserted a new genre into this anime in order to make a \"happy ending.\" Of course I'mhappy for the \"happy ending\" but I didn't want it to have to end like this; magical... Everything but that the story line was great. It made me cry at certain times. It even feature events after Highschool for Tomoya.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\r\nWhy do I even have to rate art. Unless you want the male/female lead to be extremely hot and sexy, what was the point of rating. But all in all, the art had an improvement from the previous season. It actually conveys the character's mood incredibly better. Sad times look like \"sad times\" now. HURRAY. Now I feel sad. -.-\"\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10):\\n\r\nNo improvement in the second season. But the first episode scared me with the sound effects. Which impressed me. The ball almost hit my eye... or anything else special. Don't think to hard. *cough* I'm a guy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10):\\n\r\nSame characters. Some changed. Some didn't? Yeah some didn't but these characters, I can't imagine if they did change... For sure the main characters, Tomoya and Nagisa, changed dramatically.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nThe first time I saw this it felt like the old Clannad! I was so happy to see this and I told myself, \"I won't cry this time!\" Too bad I lied to myself. Shame on me! It was such a moving anime. There was a load of symbolism and foreshadowing that hint what would happen. I kept looking for them and soon enough I found them! I used the symbols and hints the author gave me to predict the end and it worked! It was such a great anime but... Naw just kidding there are no \"buts.\" It was just great...\\n",

            "content": "Synopsis: \r\nEvents in Clannad: After Story take place immediately after the first season, following Tomoya's final semester of high school. After declaring his love to Nagisa, they begin to have a close relationship. Their life together will be faced with unexpected challenges, as the truth behind the illusionary world and the city's legend come to light.\r\nAnimation [10/10]:\r\nKyoto Animation, in other words, simply beautiful. The animation is so well drawn and it almost seems that is flows like water.\r\nMusic [10/10]:\r\nThe music was just...WOW. The music played a huge role in the story. The opening theme is just great, which gives you the whole feeling of Clannad:After Story in song. The ending theme was a great happy-inducing song. But it can also function as a blunt mood-killer. However, I won't bump the score down because of this. One of my favorite scenes in this anime would not have such a powerful effect without its music. I soon found myself playing \"Dango Daikazoku\" on the piano. (Said song not in Clannad:After Story.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters [10/10]:\\n\\n\r\nI have not forgotten any of these characters, even after a full year after watching the anime for the first time, and I'm not planning on doing so anytime soon. Tomoya Okazaki remains as my second most favorite male role in anime, right behind Kyon. The heroines here are also just as great. Nagisa Furukawa is a character you won't be forgetting for a while. The supporting characters also build up the story along with the lead characters. But my favorite character in this anime has to Ushio. \\n\\n\r\nStory [10/10]:\\n\\n\r\nKey will provide you with one of the best stories ever told. The comedy had me in tears of laughter. I even replayed some parts several times, making me take up an hour just to watch one episode. The drama had me throwing my man card into the fire. Words cannot even begin to describe how enthralled I was about this part of the anime. It has also taught me a few ways to live life better. I was tears of sadness and joy. It has taught me to enjoy life to the fullest with whatever you have. The ending, however, confused me for the first time, but I somehow managed to understand what had happened. And the extraordinarily happy ending made up for this.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL [10/10]:\\n\\n\r\nClannad remains as Key's most classic story. You will cry tears of joy, sadness, and laughter as you progress through this story. Not only will you enjoy, you will experience a change on your look on life. Clannad (meaning family) will teach you to cherish all the great things in life, to plow through hardships, and overall, to enjoy the life that was given to you to the fullest extent. The awesome music, the beautiful art, the amazing characters, the extraordinary story, and a life-changing moral gives Clannad: After Story a rightful place as one of the best anime ever made.",

            "content": "Clannad: After Story is the sweet and heartwarming sequel to the anime series Clannad. If you have not seen Clannad yet, then I suggest that you go watch it first before you watch After Story so it can make more sense, but nonetheless this is another fantastic series.\r\nStory: Now the series begins right after the end of Clannad, and goes on about the relationship between Nagisa Furukawa and Tomoya Okazaki. Their love for each other grows and they face many hardships, but soon they become a family. Many obstacles appears but they persevere on together loving each other. It also teaches the theme that lifeisn't as always as planned and many times all good things have to come to an end.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The artwork is still as beautiful as ever. There is more beautiful/mood scenes here than Clannad because now they are adult and no longer stay at the high school. So the scenes/places does change quite a bit, but it is still beautiful as ever. The characters does not appear much older but there are some changes that can be seen to make them appear more mature than older. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The songs they use for this series is till as calming and convey the feelings that occurs just as well as Clannad. Though in this series there are more sad and happy moments than Clannad, where many of the music are mainly mood lifting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: What makes this series different from Clannad is the amount of interaction the Tomoya has with the other characters. It truly shows how he has changed from being alone to be surrounded by many friends. It mainly shows how much happiness Tomoya and Nagisa have after both agree to spend the rest of their lives together. Since he has entered the adult world he now becomes more mature and the same goes for Nagisa. The other characters appear more often, mainly Akio and Sanae, and have a larger impact on Tomoya, unlike in Clannad where the support characters only appear once in awhile. It is easily seen how Tomoya matures up to be a fine man, but he still has his shortcomings like his pessimistic side on how he is a worthless guy. Also a new character is introduced and is a life changer to Tomoya that makes him realize the meaning of family.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I gave this series a 10 because it touches both end of the emotional spectrum, both Sadness and Happiness and all those in between. Now the series does have it happy and heartwarming moments where you can feel like life is perfect, but then there is that unexpected turn like in reality where things don't always goes the way you want it to. Same here applies to Clannad: After Story. There is that reoccurring theme that life can never always be perfect and that eventually many good things will have to come to an end. But if you fight on, and you have people that love you and supports you, you can make it on no matter how hard it seems. It is a theme that can be easily seen in Clannad: After Story. Now The for this series it may seem kind of slow paced, but I really like it how the series slowly build up to its climax before ending well. It really is good and I think you should try it out.",

            "content": "I may not be as active with anime as much as other people, but I highly doubt there can be an anime that made me cry, made me laugh, and made me rethink my life as much as Clannad: After Story did. I came into this anime expecting a half assed sequel to a great anime and I got something that was even better than its predicessor... a rare find on its own. I'll try my hardest not to spoil this anime, because trust me, it should be watched by everyone and it does not deserve to be spoiled.\r\nThe story of its predicessor was nothingspecial. So this anime didn't have that big of shoes to fill. But my GOD, After Story did a better job with story telling than its predicessor (I will be comparing this anime to Clannad a lot, mind you). I can talk about the story more, but it won't do the story justice... just take my word for it, it's great. However there were times where I had to sleuth my way through the story, because I lose track of what happend, but that's not a bad thing. I like a bit of confusion. The pacing is MUCH better than the original as well, and I'm glad too. There wasn't a point where the anime slowed down for me. There were times where I cried a lot in this anime. My connection to the characters in this sequel was so strong. Much stronger than the connection with the characters in the prequel, even if they were the same characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is made by Key, so it's good. That goes without saying, once again. The enviorments are lush and beautiful and the characters are well drawn as usual. They retain the same art as usual and I cannot be more thankful.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is a step up from the original. Not by much, but it's a step up nonetheless. More of the better tracks are played here and they fit in with the enviorments and what happens. One thing that the original didn't do very well, and it was fixed with finesse in its sequel.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were improved here, and it focuses more on the two main characters in the prequel, which is good, I liked them. But one thing the prequel didn't do very well was explain them, and it was done here, which I was happy to see. The male lead works hard to support his family, and his secrets were tragic to hear... the secrets of him and his father made me rethink my relationship with my father... as farfetched as that may sound, it's the truth, but I won't go into detail about that. The female lead is relateable and is just as cutesy as ever. However I was strongly connected to her and what ends up happening is simply tragic and one of the most memorable moments in an anime, once again, to avoid spoiling, I won't go into detail.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime from start to finish. It's an emotional roller coaster and I enjoyed being punched around by my emotions, as crazy as that may sound. Any anime enthusiast who hasn't seen this masterpiece should be ashamed of themselves and should be stripped of their anime watching priveldges for life. In fact, I don't understand why you're still reading this, when it should be watched right now, I can assure you'll enjoy it, just as much as I did.... unless you're stupid or something.",

            "content": "So, if you're like me and didn't like this anime, follow along.\r\nIf you're someone who liked the anime and would like to get another perspective on it, follow along, but be prepared that it will become pretty ugly at times. I decided to write this review after finishing only 22 of the 24 episodes of Clannad:Afterstory, because I think this anime has failed so hard in some crucial aspects to this point that the last 2 episodes, no matter what they are about, can't change my opinion anymore nor can they contribute anything to the \"quality\" of this review. \r\nBesides, I must admit that Ihaven't much practice in writing reviews for anime, so if I sometimes fail to give the review proper structure or concise formulations, please accept my apologies. I also won't break the review into \"story, sound etc.\" categories, since I will discuss specific points that upset me, and the categories then intermingle anyway.\\n\\n\r\nMy review will contain huge spoilers, in part also for Clannad (2007). So if you plan to watch the show or if youre amidst of watching it, dont read any further.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS INCOMING.\\n\\n\r\nSo, first...what the heck? How did this anime get to rank 11 on MAL???\\n\r\nThat's what I've been asking myself over and over while watching this anime. \\n\r\nFrankly, I found this Anime\\n\\n\r\nabysmal\\n\r\nhorrible\\n\r\natrocious\\n\\n\r\nYeah, I think of this Anime as an atrocity. Clannad (2007) just had bored for most of the time, and especially the female lead character Nagisa wasn't my type. \\n\r\nBut Clannad: Afterstory, really made it over the top. I've never watched an anime before which made me CRINGE in agony so hard and so many times, and I don't mean the type of agony that leads to voting this anime up to rank 11...\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so what exactly is it that me set me off so hard?\\n\r\nI'll start out with the points that angered me the least and work my way up to the tip of the iceberg.\\n\\n\r\nMINOR STUFF (skip if you want to get to the real fun):\\n\r\nFirst, I often struggled to determine what this anime actually wanted to be genrewise. I got it that it's slice of life, and basically this genre pretty much contains everything you could ask for. But it usually builds an implicite ruleset, what scenarios to unfold and what characters to bring forth. In this case, the anime started out with three minor storyarcs, one about sunohara and his little sister, one about the woman who keeps sunoharas dorm (sry forgot the name) and her past, and one about the librarygirl (yukine I think) and her \"brother\". Now, I found all the three arcs rather mediocre, but sunoharas and sunoharas dormkeepers arc remained within the boundaries of what we had seen so far. It introduced us to an individuals crisis, showed us all the ugly details and then how the individual somehow overcame this obstacle. \\n\r\nWhat really bothered me was the librarygirl arc. First, the idea of her being involved with a huge gang using her library as a safe haven was really far fetched and didn't fit into the commodities the series had developed over the course of clannad (2007) and neither did it fit into the commodities the series developed over the course of clannad:after story. It kind of felt like a half-assed reception of \"westside story\", gauged down the throat of the typical contemporary high-school anime.\\n\r\nThen, the arc almost purposefully seems to remain below its potential. After starting out with its ridiculous premise, it seems like it cant decide wether the arc shall be comedy or drama, and ultimately fails in both disciplines. I didn't enjoy the jokes and neither found I any depth in the plot of the gang war and librarygirls involvement through her dead brother. \\n\r\nThe only thing the plot manages is to show librarygirl coping with her pain of losing her brother, although the viewer isn't even told what exactly was the cause of his death. How and why someone died is a huge point though for those staying behind. If you're loved one died a sudden,gruesome, violent and pointless death, I guess you will agree that it affects you differently than when he died peacefully after his death had been predicted months before. \\n\r\nOf course death is always harsh, but even this harshness knows variety, which this anime seemingly wanted to play down. This leads us to the second half of the anime.\\n\r\nAfter this first half, the anime basically resets with the male leads (Tomoya) graduation and his entry into the world of adulthood. \\n\r\nThis second half is almost like another anime. It is largely detached from the first half because the plots from the first half don't even contribute characterwise. Tomoya hasn't gone through any development so far and the characters that actually had development simply disappear entirely for a long time and when they reappear, they dont fill any meaningful function. \\n\r\nWell, so much about my MINOR issues with the anime. \\n\r\nOne last thing: it's not like I dislike an episodic format in general. \\n\r\nI simply disliked that the anime on the one hand had characterdevelopment, but on the other hand mostly discarded these developments after each arc. They simply have little to no meaning even though the characters are still there oftentimes!\\n\\n\r\nMAJOR STUFF (continue reading for the juicy moments)\\n\r\nSo, lets get to the MAJOR issues, obviously also revolving around the MAJOR plotpoints of Clannad:Afterstory, converging in the second half of the anime. \\n\r\nSo, up to this point, Tomoyas and Nagisas relationship was rather unimportant. The anime was about other characters so far and therefore both screentime and development of these two characters relationship was simply set on \"hold\", metaphorically spoken. I don't like this style, although I can live with it. \\n\r\nWhat I can't live with is what happened AFTER this hiatus.  (Maybe thats why its called AFTERSTORY, haha :P Sry, but I couldnt keep it in.)\\n\r\nAround the 10th-12th episode, the pacing is really picking up. Just to set up my own referencepoints to which I will refer to during my final rant, I'll give a very brief summary of what happens from the start of half II on (I'll also leave out many important details I must admit, but I will bring them in when needed)\\n\\n\r\nTomoya graduates and decides to look for a job. \\n\r\nAfter some time, he starts out at a company repairing streetlamps and stuff. \\n\r\nHe moves out from nagisas home and she decides to care for him in his new apartment. Sooner or later, he proposes to her and she accepts. They get married and ultimately nagisa moves in at tomoyas apartment, so they live together now. Nagisa wants a baby, she gets pregnant, has the baby and then dies. Tomoya is crushed to say the least, for years he's not even having much contact with his child giving it into care at nagisas parents. \\n\r\nNagisas mom finally manages to bring tomoya and his child together while also arranging a meeting with his grandma for him (which he cant even remember anymore!) who tells him stuff about his and his fathers past. This clarifies a lot to him and he starts to respect his father, he repairs his relationship with him and sends him home to his mother (tomoyas grandmother). He continues to care for his child, which ultimately dies as well. Then lightbubbles appear, time is rewinded and nagisa survives the birth of ushio. Then I decided to stop watching before writing this review.\\n\\n\r\nTHAT MUCH about the plot. Now, the plot by itself isn't what brought my rage on. It is the characters acting inside this plot.\\n\r\nThe very core of this beast is Nagisa. As I already said, she wasn't my type in Clannad (2007), and this didn't really change throughout the very little screentime she got in the first half of Clannad:Afterstory. But what she did then in the second half really went beyond whats bearable in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nBasically living together with Tomoya, she immediately slips neatlessly into the role of the caring wife centering her whole life around her husband. After finishing her duties for school, she immediately turns to the needs of tomoyas life, who gets sucked up by work so much that he can't even attend the school festival on the weekend to which nagisa was looking forward so much. Nagisa fails to make friends in her new class, becoming increasingly isolated especially through her sickness which regularly puts her out of school for weeks and months. The bonds from earlier on with tokomo etc. seem to have vanished in an instant as well, which might be plausible, but in my opinion not very smart for an anime which revolved around building friendships between these very characters for about 75% of the time.\\n\r\nHowever, even if I accept this since it might just be a sad reality in japan for the average schoolfriendship (which I hope it isn't), I can't accept the extreme dependence on tomoya that unfolds before us.\\n\r\nSeriously, the individual Nagisa, of which there was very very little to begin with, has been dissolved entirely now and the process of reassembling her into an uncompromising stereotype of a suicidal motherbeast has just begun. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I proceed, I want to make one thing clear: I'm not one of these rabid social-justice warriors who is taking out the flag of feminism now. I can totally imagine that someone WANTS to play the maternal role in a relationship because he/she has developed into a person which finds personal fulfillment in caring and nurturing others. I can also understand fully that someone might want to take the paternal role and step into a big job with lots of responsibilities and very few spare-time left for yourself. \\n\r\nBut here it's not just about the decisions that the characters made, but about the thought processes that lead to them, or better said: The lack of a thought process leading to it.\\n\\n\r\nIn very short order, these two have made multiple big decisions. Tomoya has started work directly after obligatory education, Nagisa is doing the same and both have moved into an apartment just now and are freshly married. They haven't even lived together for a year, they haven't even lived through their new life situation for more than a year or two or three or ANY considerable amount of time, and they already decide to HAVE CHILDREN, NOW!\\n\r\nTHIS much alone is enough for me to make these two characters a little dimwhitted, but still kind of lovable since I actually _do_ think of it as a rather sweet concept to start out your young life like this.\\n\\n\r\nIn a fairy tale of course. \\n\\n\r\nBut we don't live in a fairy tale but in a reality where problems don't get solved by white knights or benevolent pixies, so when you make such a longterm decision like parenthood, for gods sake you have to think about it thoroughly. But Nagisas thinking at this point seems to consist of singing the Dango Daikazoku song while dreaming up shiny visions of a picturebook familylife. \\n\r\nTHIS is what almost got me vomitting at my screen! This girl has NO other perspective on her life, on REALITY, than getting pregnant and raising childen and doing the household! How old is she? She probably hasn't even reached her twenties yet, although I must say that in the scene directly after their marriage, the artists did a fairly well job in drawing her like 15 years older than she usually looks. And no, its not just the outfit, her facial outlines have been clearly changed for this very moment where she is intended to begin adulthood in her new role as a wife and soon-to-be mother.\\n\\n\r\nBut it doesn't stop with Nagisa. Nobody and Nothing from her/their social environment has anything to say about their plans for life before or after her getting pregnant. Not even Tomoya himself, who plays a crucial part in making them both parents. HE is affected by this as well, yet the whole thought process boils down to an astonished face when Nagisa asks him to impregnate her and thats it! Holy cow, what is this meant to show us?\\n\r\nThese two are like propaganda-figures in the manifesto of a fanatic back-to-the-pre-industrial-times! I mean comeon, she even wants to have the baby at home despite her bad health, so they can uphold old traditions!\\n\\n\r\nThis is simply too much, it is despiseable, stupid and ignorant! It is also highly implausible, since Tomoya himself had to go through the pain of seeing his father getting destroyed by the sadness and overburdening duty to both work and care for his son all alone after his mother had died in an accident.\\n\r\nI know what I'm speaking of, since such a calamity has run in my family as well! NEVER would someone with a past like Tomoya willingly put his partners life at such danger through such an irresponsible act. Failing at contraception is one thing, pulling the trigger on purpose is a whole different story. \\n\r\nIt's not only a catastrophe for both parents, it's also for the child.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey, when we're talkin about the child already, lets go deeper. Lets talk about the iron grandma Sanae-san forbidding the child to cry in the presence of others! WHAT THE F...??? Are you really really serious? You aren't making this up right?\\n\r\nI know japanese culture is rather conservative on such topics, and I've seen enough anime where people handle this issue the same. But an Anime thats been seen by a global community and ranked by a global community cant rely entirely on that argument. The rank 11 must come from somewhere. The reviews of glory over this anime must come from somewhere. \\n\r\nI can't understand how so many people can dwell in praising this anime to Elysium and back for its \"authenticity\" and its \"emotional impact\", when we only get stupid, ignorant and cold-blooded stereotypes of the pre-industrial japanese social rolemodel?\\n\\n\r\nI could rant on like this forever, like about Tomoya and Ushia engaging in highly artificial, staged encounters and conversations, about Nagisas parents behaving like emotionless comedyrobots before and after Nagisas death (Yes, they should've talked to her about wether or not to get pregnant at all in her condition, about alternatives like adoption, they should have talked to her about giving birth in a hospital instead of at home in her condition, they should have talked to her about THEIR LOVE FOR HER AND THAT THEY MIGHT GET CRAZY IF SHE DIES), about Tomoyas fathers family seemingly not giving a shit about the stupid decision to take it all on himself!\\n\r\nYeahyeah, the japanophile will now raise his finger and say \"Shouganai\" = \"it can't be helped\", the fatalistic japanese attitude towards unpleasant circumstances \"that can't be helped\", but this doesn't suffice here!\\n\r\nTomoya and Nagisa willingly chose this path and there was PLENTY of time and ressources to thoroughly think this through. \\n\r\nIf for example the same had happened to tomoya, that Nagisa just died through a tragic accident, then all would be fine. \\n\r\nI would've shed unspoiled tears of true sorrow.\\n\r\nBut this way it didn't work, because these two characters and their environment are such artificial stereotypes, desperately clinging to a late 19th century (in terms of european culture, dont know whats the equvialent for east Asia) life and partnership moral codex that it hurts my innates inside out. I almost can't write a normal sentence anymore because of this disgusting, foul stench of a narrow-minded, bigoted, regressive, antirational worldview emanating from these characters. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know why they did this, or why the source material did this. I have trouble figuring out wether this shall be some form of propaganda or poorly executed satire. To me, these two characters and Nagisas parents have willingly brought destruction over their lifes. They are prime-examples of what Kant called \"self-imposed immaturity\" in my opinion, because they really excelled in constantly ignoring that red flashing button telling them to activate their brains and at least TRY to prevent the calamity. \\n\r\nBut at least I got the pretty firm _feeling_ that the author/producer/whoever wrote this, indeed intended to confer a very very very conservative, nay antiquated, nay almost antediluvian worldview with his story. \\n\r\nThe intrusion of the supernatural, or should i better say the transcendent, into the ordinary world completes the picture of a world connected to absolute, unquestionable values and determinants. \\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, this supernatural component is in a benevolent connection to the world and its inhabitants, so that even in the face of all hardship, at least a \"happy end\" is in sight, or better said: it's all part of a greater thing in which all the bad that happened is put into a higher context in which all finally resolves in happiness. \"All dango-friends take each other by the hand and live happily ever after\" or whatever that line was in nagisas favourite song. Thats basically what the line suggests.  \\n\\n\r\nTo me, this anime has a very high manipulative potential. I still could see it theoretically as some kind of persiflage, but to be honest, there is nothing hinting at it. The characters are just meant to display what they are, I cant even find a single example where the story would try to urge the viewer to take a critical perspective. Its characters follow invisible rails laid out before them, internalized through traditions they seem to have sucked up with their first milk. But this is dangerous, and so this is the first time I really feel urged to warn of an anime. Again, dont get me wrong, Im not holding anyone from making their own decisions, and be it to become a puritan living a hermits live on a solitary mountain. But whatever decision we make, we must use our mind. we must reflect, and then we must decide for the best of ourselves and others. This is the gift we were given by nature, god, coincidence, whatever you want to call it. If we dont use this gift properly, we are irresponsible about ourselves and others.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I want to finish this very gory, spiteful review on a positive note. There was something that I really liked about this second half of Clannad:Afterstory. It was the reunison of father and son and how they forgave each other. It doesnt matter in this case why tomoyas father got into this miserable situation in the first place. In the end, as a family all we can do is to make amends with each other and move on together, supporting each other (at least in most cases, unfortunately reality sometimes wont even let us do that). Thats what this scene has told us. \\n\r\nIndeed, this scene has moved me to tears, and it still does thinking about it. \\n\r\nAlso, because I think that we, our generation, must learn again how to live with our parents and grandparents. It takes a lot of effort to get there, in most cases I guess, but it is worth it, both for the child(ren) and the parent(s), I think. Sometimes it might not be possible, but we should at least try. Because, if we cant even bring ourselves to join hands with our family, how are we supposed to truly join hands with others? How shall all the dangofriends join hands, if they werent able to join hands inside their family?\\n\r\nYeah ;)\\n",

I kinda like that concept, because we get to know the characters but not in a filler episode way. Really gets you connected to all of them. I dropped Clannad at episode 6, because I didn't think I would enjoy it. I was so wrong. It's on the top of my list now! Season 2 hit me like a train. All those feelings and thoughts going through my head... I never could have though, that an anime could touch me the way Clannad did.For anyone reading this, I can only recommend it. I have teary eyes writing this review right now. \\n\\n\r\nClannad stole my manliness... I will never ever forget this anime and it's amazing story and soundtracks. <3\\n\r\nThank you for the Journey!",

            "content": "Holy fucking shit. Seriously, what the actual fuck. THIS is the \"masterpiece\" that I \"had\" to watch? I pushed myself through the boringness of the prequel in order to experience the supposedly \"amazing pleasure\" that is Clannad: After Story, and THIS is what I get?\r\nLook, I'll be fair. Clannad: After Story is not a bad anime. It's definitely better that its bad prequel. However, that's really not saying much, is it? While After Story manages to give us a more interesting story than its prequel, it falls victim to plenty of the same problems and adds some new ones as well.\r\nStory: After Story starts outexactly where the prequel left off: boring high school crap. After we have to sit through even more boring arbitrary sadness involving all the female characters that didn't get used up in the prequel, the anime finally graduates and enters the rest of the world. The story really picks up there, and we get to watch a few genuinely interesting episodes. Most of the cast is put on a bus so we can focus on the characters that actually matter without annoyances, and the events that unfold draw your attention. Unfortunately, there's a climax soon afterwards, and everything goes to shit again. The anime returns to shoving arbitrary sadness down our throats. I pushed myself through the boredom hoping for a satisfying conclusion, but I was disappointed, as the ending throws all logic and coherence in the trash can in order to force something impossible to happen. After the story ends there are two additional side-story episodes, which I didn't watch and therefore can't tell you about. I'm assuming they are bad. \\n\\n\r\nArt: After Story looks good, just like the prequel. The problem of female characters (or feminine boy characters) having way too large eyes remains, but other than that, no complains. The settings look good, the male characters look good, the animation is good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice acting is good just like that of the prequel, maybe a bit better. The music is basically the same, but it feels more intrusive this time. It's not bad on its own, but the way it is used can be really annoying at times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The main character is definitely more interesting than last time. It's also nice how most of the cast was written out of the biggest part of the show, since we got rid of subpar characters that way. But in general, there's not really anything else to praise here. It's not like most of the characters that remain are actually interesting. Not to mention that some of the new characters did not pull their weight, either.\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked the first Clannad, watch this. You'll definitely like it. If you didn't like the first Clannad but are thinking of watching After Story because you've heard about how it's significantly better and a masterpiece and all those things, don't. It's just a waste of your time, unless you plan on using the knowledge to argue with Clannad fans.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Yay! Another Clannad review!\r\nSo I recently wrote a review for the first season of Clannad and enjoyed it immensely. So I was a bit worried about Clannad: After Story, I didn't want it to go downhill from there. Fortunately, it did not. It just went uphill instead! It was just as good, maybe even better than Clannad. The story was amazing, the characters likable, and the animation gorgeous. This anime made me cry more than any anime I have ever seen. \r\nOne thing that annoys me about a lot of romance animes is that they spend the entire story line just trying to make theirrelationship work. And when it finally does, boom! the story is over! That's why I like Clannad and Clannad: After Story so much. They keep with Tomoya and Nagisa even after they both graduate. It made the story much more interesting and enjoyable for me.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I love about After Story and Clannad is that it's not a typical high school romance anime. As I stated in my previous review, there was  a supernatural twist to the story line and I thoroughly enjoyed that. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to go into too much detail as the guidelines say no spoilers. However I did get very confused at the end. What exactly was up with the girl and the doll story line? What I got from it was that Tomoya was somehow connected to the doll and the girl was Ushio, but that's just me. I'm still very confused by this whole thing so if anyone could explain it to me, it's be greatly appreciated. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, should you watch this anime? Absolutely, but not if you haven't seen the first season yet because it definitely ties up some things from the first season that you'll need to know.",

            "content": "Can I simultaneously think an anime is flawed, be anxious for the anime for an end, and think it's one of the best anime I've ever seen? It's pretty easy to say why After Story is so good. It's a story that celebrates life without romanticizing it. There is happiness, there is friendship, there is love, there is family, there is tragedy, there is regret, there is irrationality. It's all there and it's all incredibly moving. The simple and powerful plot is backed up with excellent music and visuals. I especially like how many of the characters' faces are dominated by their eyes especially becausetheir mouths and noses are so small. It reminded me of some of my favorite movies including Wolf Children, Boyhood, and The Way Way Back which were about people living more or less ordinarily lives and it being so enjoyable to see people find happiness in a situation so much like my own. From that phenomenal base, what I am I to think of the flaws? The series starts out with short admittedly entertaining side stories about minor characters that having very little to do with the main plot. The series has a supernatural element which provides a sense of beauty and foreboding but on the whole distracts from the main plot. The ending of the series ties in with the supernatural element and comes out of nowhere. There is an entire recurring theme about blaming the city itself for the protagonist problems which doesn't really make any sense from either a logical or emotion point of view even with the supernatural elements. To top it all off the series has 24 subbed episodes on Kissanime and I was so eger to finished it that when I saw \"The End\" at the end of episode 22 I jumped on the chance to stop watching the series. At the end of the day, the incredibly moving core narrative about one character's everyday life and hardships makes the anime something really special. However, the flaws can not be overlooked so while large chunks of the anime I loved enough to give it a 10, I'm going to temper those emotions by accounting for it's flaws my desire to finish the series.",

            "content": "Yo so Clannad afterstory, the second installment to the Clannad story is one of those animu that people love for them feels. After recently watching it again i realised that there were some problems with it which i thought were DOGSHITE . Admittedly, i am a hater so before you call me out to fight at your local park (It's how we settle things in Australia), imma tell you what parts about the second season i didn't like and why.\r\nThe art and animation are fine, same as the previous. While it is good, its nothing groundbreaking. nothing i feel that i need to speak muchabout. \\n\\n\r\nNow the story and characters is where i started having serious problems with this series. When you agree to invest your time into watching a highschool love drama, that's what you'd expect to get right. And that is what we got in the first half of the season. Now I'm not saying I don't like that, in fact I didn't mind the whole screwing around in school, with Okazaki going about his usual troll and yohei getting beat up. In one of the arcs there was even a hint of the cliched highschool delinquent rumble (which i am quite fond of). Yup, the first 10 odd episodes were I thought mostly good. It was only after the first half that i REALLY started having problems with where we were going, specifically after Okazaki graduates from highschool. Remember how i said i expected high school drama from a high school drama? What i DID NOT expect was the series to go all heavy on me where instead of a lighthearted high school love story drama they move onto the real life issues of Okazaki having to deal with his crap (getting a real life/sorting out shit with his drop kick dad). WHAT HAPPENED TO MY LIGHT-HEARTED HIGH SCHOOL DRAMA? Now now, i'm not saying i hate this kind of story, I mean if its done well im down for it (Usagi drop). However if you asked me if i was expecting this shit after watching season one then my answer is: I WAS NOT. It also does not help that afterstory goes all hunter x hunter on us, completely ditching like half the characters for pretty much the rest of the season to focus on Nagisa and Okazaki. I GET that my ships (Tomoya & Kyou) just so happened hit icebergs and I GET that they gotta make space for the real mains, but that DOES NOT excuse bailing on characters in which i was all emotionally invested in then throwing us a bone and expecting us to be satisfied by reintroducing them at the end. And quite frankly i think Nagisa is the most boring out of our other options of female mains. I guess one could interpret this as me venting from being butt hurt (which i guess i kinda am), but these points are what i thought was, straight up, ass about afterstory.\\n\\n\r\nOh you thought i was done? NAW BRUH you got off the station before Central. I mean even after taking into account the above perceived flaws, if that was all it was i would be willing to give Clannad a passing mark. But another thing that i feel HAS to be talked about is the frankly DOGSHIT ending. For those who have not yet watched i will try not to spoil too much, but my suggestion is that if you haven't, just go to the end.\\n\\n\r\n[spoiler]So basically it's this, complications arise making our hero, Okazaki, turn into something resembling his dad from grief. After he finally attempts to redeem himself and things are looking up for him, more complications arise which basically spell the end of the world for Okazaki (how it became like this from the high school love drama, i dunno). Ok, yeah its kinda dark but that wasn't what i hated the most. What i hated the most was the COMPLETE bullshit Deus Ex that ensues after. I mean why bother showing us like three episodes about Okazaki trying to redeem himself then quietly sweep all that under the carpet in exchange for the ending they gave us? Honestly i thought it was a cop out. I can hear all the retorts already saying stuff like: \"But crave, its part of the source, they can't help it\" or \"They were leading up to it during the entire series\". SHUT UP BRO, showing us like 5 minute of COMPLETELY random scenes, and having Akio explain some phenomenon that happened years ago is NOT enough to explain the shit that happens at the end. Oh and about it being part of the source, its still bullshit. I mean if you hadn't already played the game I'd be surprised if you had ANY idea what was happening at the end. I thought it was junk, enough so that even they remade the ending to one where they drop the resolution, it would be better than what we got. sure it would have ended on a dark note, but at least i wouldn't feel so cheated at the way they seemingly dodge logic.[/spoiler]\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end, a focus on boring characters, out of place story, and cop-out ending were the problems i had with Clannad. If you disagree then 8:00 PM, Moore Park West fite me bro.",

            "content": "What you're about to embark on here is a journey through the wide range of human emotions. This isn't one to take lightly and I recommend you plan to watch this series in as few sittings as possible, otherwise you'll wind up at four in the morning and still watching because you can't possibly stop. You will laugh, you will cry, if you don't you're not human.\r\nThe story picks off pretty quickly after Clannad and it doesn't miss a beat. It's pretty much like continuing the last series except the scope gets bigger, a lot bigger. Be prepared for some very well put forward lifelessons about responsibility and finding ones place in the world, not to mention that ever important theme of family.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are the same as from Clannad obviously, and they all seem to grow naturally, each moving on from triumphs and failures of the past, each growing up in a way that seems believable. Do keep in mind though, this series will span most of a decade, so if you were hoping that they would all stay their same somewhat zany high school selves, you're going to be in for a disappointment. Development and growing up are key themes, only slammed home by some seriously tear jerking scenes that will leave you groping for another tissue. And take heart, the side story with the robot and the girl in the world that ended will be resolved. How will leave you with intense emotion, and that's as detailed as I'm going to get.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is spot on once again, the Dango Daikazoku song is back as background music and as a beautiful lullaby and the rest of the score supports the on screen happenings. Whether it's Tomoya about to get into another fight or a tender scene with Nagisa, they hit almost all the right notes. There were times when I thought there could have been a bit more variety but the familiar themes help connect the world together as time goes on.\\n\\n\r\nIt is really hard to talk about this anime without spoiling the plot, but this is one you simply cannot miss. If you haven't seen Clannad, see that first, you're enjoyment will be much greater. As I said at the start, you will cry, frequently, there will be times when an episode will end and you're just as emotionally exhausted as the character, and then there will be episodes where you're laughing away and you can forget what was causing your tears. This is an emotional roller coaster, high highs, low lows and twists and loops that will make you think rather introspectively about your own life.\\n\\n\r\nIt is well worth the rides, don't miss it. Stick with it to the end and I promise this will become one of your all time favorite stories that you will think back fondly on.",

            "content": "Clannad: After Story...whenever I think of this anime, I find myself to be in a state of pure amazement. Anything less than perfect doesn't fully describe this anime. \r\nOriginality. As a continuation to the Clannad series one can expect wonders. This is one of the few anime that go beyond 'getting the girl' and show us what goes on after from the beginning to the end. \r\nThe story of Clannad: After Story is such an inspiring one; a boy who finds the one he can truly say he loves, and through the little 'hells' and tribulations he has to over come and succeed he becomesa man and achieves the best reward; A happy family. \\n\r\nWhile watching this series, you find yourself feeling more and more connected to the main character Tomoya. \\n\\n\r\nBeautiful. The scenery in Clannad: After Story is only one thing. Beautiful. Each scene is drawn to please the eye but it also makes every scene worth the watch and adds to the whole 'drama' aspect. For a happy moment that makes you warm; an open sun-drenched field with the family. For the moment your heart breaks in two and your tears are about to fall down your face; a snow covered city with grey skies. For the moment you feel like you have been faced with a miracle; a sky filled with lights of happiness making the night sky warm. This for me is what made this series pure bliss.\\n\\n\r\nAs a fellow musician myself, I hope and believe I can say that the music in Clannad: After Story was and still is sublime. As with the scenery you can not pin just the art or the characters by itself; each individual aspect was put together to make Clannad: After Story what it is. With that said, the music in this anime pulls at the hearstrings as much as possible. With the song Dango Daikazoku as a repeating concept of family throught the story as a whole. One song that really made a big statement was the song Farewell At The Foot Of The Hill. At one moment everything was set ablaze in my heart while this song and one scene went across the screen and made the long season of Clannad: After Story worth watching. \\n\\n\r\nClannad...in Irish the word Clannad means family. That's what this main cast represents; a family with the love for each other; a family who live for each other every day of their lives. Although the cast from the first season simmers down to a three person cast, I can't complain. Clannad was about the boy getting the girl along with all the silly antics that came with it throughout highschool. Clannad: After Story shows how that boy becomes a man and how the girl becomes a woman. Each character in the story (at least I personally feel) was well thought out. From a hard background; a true hard worker when he needs to be; we have Tomoya. From a good family; one that cares for others that go out of her way to help or not even; we are given Nagisa. Both together is an odd sight at first or maybe not but it goes to show there is a person for everyone. The little gift they get from above is an absolute joy too. I felt for that character from the beginning of her role in the series. \\n\\n\r\nI thoroughly enjoyed this series. I can say this with a smile on my face. It was cute; it was devastating to the heart, it was radiant to the eye; it was beautiful to the soul; it was Clannad: After Story. \\n\\n\r\nClannad: After Story for me has been a journey. I haven't been much of an avid anime watcher (yet) but this story has been touching. I am truly moved by the whole plot and idea of a boy becoming a man. It was great from the first moment of the first episode to the dramatic and still amazing ending of the last. Happy moments, heavyhearted moments, and everything else. As I have said before, Clannad: After Story is a result of every aspect done what I feel as perfect. The inspiring story of life; The magnificent art that lives through feelings or rather shows feelings; the music that touches the soul; and the cast that struggles through hard ships and tragedies we all know and have experienced. Beautiful. Nothing less than perfect. \\n\\n\\n",
