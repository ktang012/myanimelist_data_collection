            "content": "To all appearances Children of the Whales seemed to be a promising anime. I have the impression that the series held all the necessary elements to be a memorable work: partially interesting and potentially exceptional worldbuilding, splendid artistic direction, intriguing characters... but after 2 episodes, the series goes in another direction and gets worse gradually. In the end, we have a lot of tears, melodrama, inconsistencies, and far too much in my opinion.\r\nStory: Chakuro is 14 years old and is an archivist / scribe on the Mud Whale, an island that floats on a sea of endless sand. That island has several specificities. There aretwo types of people: marked and unmarked. Chakuro is in the first category, that is, he can use saimia, a supernatural ability that unfortunately is responsible for their untimely death. There are other rules like never fighting (very useful to be used as a plot-convenience), not to cry for dead people and especially not to inquire about their existence and their presence on the island. Indeed the Council that governs the people of Mud Whale, doesn't want its people to understand why they live here and why they have supernatural powers.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Chakuro? One day he makes a trip with some friends (including Ohni) to an island they discover nearby (without the authorization of the Council). They meet a mysterious girl named Lykos. They also find a strange structure called the No\u00fbs (which absorbs the emotions of humans)\\n\r\nChakuro brings Lykos on the Mud Whale. The Council strongly opposes and decides to question the girl. However I specify that the girl is a kuudere (yeah ! useful for plot-convenience) so she isn't really willing to talk. We also learn that she can't express her emotions.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, the premise seemed interesting. Many mysteries concerning the origin of the inhabitants of the Mud Whale, on Lykos (which seems to come from another country), and in a general way on the world, where are the other peoples and why the Mud Whale seems so isolated? Episode 3 will therefore answer some questions but I admit that this episode was particularly disastrous. Disastrous for the Mud Whale and for the credibility of the series.\\n\\n\r\n(Light spoilers from there because there is almost impossible to talk about that show without mentioning some scenes)\\n\\n\r\nThis episode 3 begins with the arrival of a gigantic ship called Skylos. The leader (called Oruko) of this ship decides to annihilate all the inhabitants of Mud Whale. Why? No explanation at first, we understand later that the inhabitants of Mud Whale were exiled a hundred years ago. Why exiled? Because they have emotions. And it is here that the series seems hardly credible. If the other inhabitants don't have emotions then why do we see the other pink-haired idiot (Ryodari) be glad killing innocent people? Why is Oruka so happy to kill people? We always see him laughing. So they get emotional !\\n\r\nWell, I won't be a scold. There is an explanation for Ryodari who apparently has strong emotions. Honestly I have the impression that this explanation was later created to erase the inconsistencies and that it was not really anticipated. Also, the introduction of this character was particularly bad and this character is really detestable. I don't care about his situation and I don't sympathize.\\n\r\nHowever, I didn't have explanations for the other characters. The No\u00fbs is supposed to absorb their emotions so why do we see Oruko laughing? Why do we see the other captain being scared when he meets the Daimonias for the first time? They aren't supposed to have emotions so they should just be indifferent.\\n\\n\r\nI can understand that it is difficult to create characters without emotions but in this case, why the author decided to make a difference between the inhabitants of the Mud Whale and the other populations? Finally they are rather similar. When they are in danger, they are afraid. When they are happy, they smile. What is the difference between Oruko and the inhabitants of Mud Whale?\\n\r\nBy the way, a surprising point. When the inhabitants of the island are threatened by the Skylos army, they decide not to defend themselves. The army wants to kill them but they do not react. Why? Because they don't have the right to kill, yeah !\\n\r\nAh ! So the inhabitants of Mud Whale prefer to respect this stupid law than to defend themselves in order to save their friends and their families. Ironically I have the impression that it is rather the inhabitants of the island who lack feelings, compassion.\\n\\n\r\nFrom this episode 3, the series was getting progressively worse. The Skylos decided to leave the inhabitants alive (after killing a lot of people, I confirm) and to abandon Lykos on the island. Lykos was a member of their army, so it made sense that the Skylos wanted Lykos to get back on the boat. However Oruko prefers to leave her on the island to do an experiment. This intention probably has no meaning and doesn't lead to any rational explanation, believe me. Oruko promises to return in a few days to completely annihilate them. (You can write \"lol\" here) The inhabitants decide to avenge their companions despite the opposition of the Council. The Council is really irritating and looks stupid. Honestly, I don't know why they are so keen to hide all the truths about their origin. This obstinacy doesn't really make sense. Furthermore, you will see that some of the members of the Council will even try to sink the boat so that its inhabitants don't fight. Again, why?\\n\\n\r\nWhy don't the inhabitants of the island have permission to fight? Will they receive a curse? Many elements are unfortunately not explained. Especially that these same inhabitants fight later and aren't really subject to a curse. The only thing that could make you doubt is the Daimonias. This is the only potential danger but still, the anime didn't show us that this power was dangerous for the allies.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the inhabitants don't have the right to cry for their dead. Why? No credible explanation. They all cry at the end of episode 3 and even constantly, each character has a tear in their eyes and there is no consequence. I don't see any curse or misfortune because the characters cried. They are unhappy because the Skylos invade their territory and kill their friends, their families.\\n\r\nAh!\\n\r\nThe curse of the whale? I don't see anything except a war, so it's not about the whale.\\n\\n\r\nLet's go through the inconsistencies to talk about the drama. The drama isn't credible. We constantly have scenes that alternate nonsense comedy and drama. And because of this I have difficulties to sympathize with the characters. For example, you see characters like Ginshu making jokes in really inappropriate moments. You see the other character touching the characters' hair as they prepare to fight the Skylos army. There are always some foolish scenes that contrast too much with the dramatic atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the characters, they are numerous. The main cast would be Chakuro, Lykos and Ohni. But the secondary cast is very present. You have a short flashback and you quickly know their feelings. However, as you know that these flashbacks indicate their future death (otherwise they wouldn't show it), suddenly the result seems predictable and uninteresting. And since their screentime is too short, it is difficult to worry about their fate. In a word, it's sloppy.\\n\\n\r\nChakuro is a very effective character for melodrama as he cries a lot and easily shows his emotions. He is very passionate at times! I don't really know what to feel for this character. He never managed to interest me in fact. He is slow, indecisive, timid, really, and his personality doesn't evolve. He seems to like Lykos but their relationship isn't particularly worked insofar as the plot takes up too much space.\\n\\n\r\nLykos is your cute kuudere. She doesn't talk with others but the character is well written. At first, she has no emotions (it makes sense !) and living with the inhabitants of Mud Whale, she will gradually feel emotions. It's a shame that the series isn't more focused on this character. It would have been interesting if we had more access to Lykos' thoughts. However, she is rather irritating thereafter. She knows some things but like the Council, she doesn't want to reveal anything and it's annoying. (Example: why do the marked ones die when they are young? Chakuro and the others don't know it, so why didn't she inform them?)\\n\\n\r\nOhni is probably the best character in the series. He is tired of living on the Mud Whale and wants to discover other places, other countries. And he even fought the first time against the Skylos army while the others didn't dare. So he must have been one of the few characters to use his brain.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, some of the secondary characters were so stupid that I laughed sometimes. For example, Suou, this character is hilarious. He is obviously not credible as a leader since he cries all the time and is unable to make decisions courageously. Besides, I remember a scene where he tries to save Ryodari. I specify that Ryodari is responsible for the death of many inhabitants (and that he doesn't regret), so WHY SUOU WANTS RYODARI TO LIVE ON THE MUD WHALE?\\n\\n\r\n(To mention a scene that made me cringe: Suou appears naked to meet people from another country. That leader... )\\n\\n\r\nOn technical aspects, the series is very satisfying. The artistic direction is truly sublime and original. I personally loved the staging, it was really beautiful. The chara design is not my cup of tea. Male characters often look like trap but the female characters and especially Lykos are very charming. The soundtrack is not really remarkable, there are surprisingly a lot of songs. I didn't find them incredible but pleasant enough. (Neri is really a mysterious character) The opening theme is definitely one of my favorites of the year. Regarding the seiyuus, I didn't particularly like the narrative parts. The narration doesn't bother me even though it's excessive (like Durarara) but Natsuki Hanae has a monotonous and boring voice. \\n\\n\r\nDisappointing. This is the first word that comes to mind. The end is also unsatisfying since the conclusion doesn't answer all the questions. I can't recommend this series but if you want to discover interesting worlds with a coherent worldbuilding and some interesting characters, watch Shinsekai yori or even stuff like the Attack on Titan do the trick.",

            "content": "I'll say this right away, Kujira no Kora wa Sajou ni Utau (AKA Children of the Whales) is not for everyone. It has amazing music and eye-catching visuals, but the story requires the audience to be interested in its themes of emotion and utopianism. The characters and setting have incredibly satisfying arcs throughout the show, but if you're not invested in them you won't find the arcs engaging or nearly as cathartic as I did. \r\nIf the show sinks its hooks in you by episode one like it did for me then chances are you'll have a great experience.\r\n(Long review ahead, TL;DR at the end.)\r\nTheworld of Children of the Whales asks its characters to conceal their emotions for the greater good, a sly criticism of today\u2019s society of people who constantly change their appearances to conform to a standard. The show uses a bit of reverse psychology to immediately establish emotions as the crux of the narrative. \\n\r\nEmotions are the core of this story but powered by a melancholic soundtrack, self-confident directing, and some of the best world building this season, Children of the Whales becomes incredibly immersive. Falling short of the manga by a small amount for cutting out some character backstories, minor side information that adds a bit more detail to the setting, and occasionally awkwardly adapted scenes.\\n\\n\r\n[Story: 8/10]\\n\r\nA vast ocean of sand carries the Mud Whale, a giant magic powered clay ship that is home to many people trying to live out their lives peacefully despite being limited to a small closed off society. Living in a small town myself I connected with the setting immediately. The feeling of being trapped in a contained society that I don\u2019t quite fit in with is shared by a group of characters in this show. \\n\r\nAbout 90% of the population possess telekinetic abilities known as saimia, which leads the afflicted to an early death which earns them the title of \u201cthe marked\u201d. This leaves the 10% of normal people to assume the role of the government, who are also referred to as \u201cunmarked\u201d. The show opens with a somber funeral scene where the main character Chakuro is seen holding back tears with many other fellow Mud Whalers. Everyone on the Mud Whale is taught to suppress their sadness whenever they are reminded by the early deaths they will inevitably face, instead of accepting the fact that they will die soon, they choose to live blissfully ignorant by forgetting about their deceased friends and moving on quickly. \\n\\n\r\nAnyone who has experienced the death of a friend or family member can surely agree that holding in your feelings only makes it worse. Getting sad and acknowledging the loved ones you\u2019ve lost is how you\u2019re able to grow and move on and that pain you feel proves that you loved and were loved. That's the sentiment Chakuro begins to lean towards after realizing the Mud Whale's rules are biased. Right away an uncertainty towards the unmarked ones is planted in the audience's minds when the rules of the Mud Whale are established. The show is able to get into your mind in subtle ways to make you ponder certain subjects so that when they're brought up more as arcs progress you will feel more emotionally impacted. However, if you don't follow these arcs intently then you'll be missing out on a large portion of the experience. Otherwise, the worthwhile pay offs may seem like a desperate attempt to make you sad. This is probably what led so many people to hate the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe conflict of the story comes from the Mud Whale\u2019s interaction with another island and how radically different their beliefs are. The Mud Whaler\u2019s beliefs towards life and emotion are put to the test as they violently clash with their enemies, creating some of the most memorable scenes in the show that stuck with me long after watching. Complex themes woven into the story are not delivered through tiresome exposition. The show gives the audience the pieces of the puzzle without holding the audience's hand and it expects you to figure it out, which makes the experience incredibly rewarding and refreshing. If the idea of working out that puzzle sounds unappealing to you then perhaps Children of the Whales may not be for you, however, I\u2019d still recommend watching the first episode just to see if it sinks its hooks in you like it did to me.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the show\u2019s most intriguing hooks is how central emotions are to the story. The telekinetic powers are controlled by emotion, the Mud Whalers are taught to suppress their emotions. The mystery is so compelling. Just by merely rewatching the first two episodes I picked up on many clues sprinkled into the dialogue (by the talented author) for the sake of people who choose to rewatch. It\u2019s a show that wants you to love it and unravel its mysteries, and it surely isn\u2019t hard to love it once you notice the clues placed with such elegance and care. \\n\\n\r\nEverything in the show has an arc, the characters, the themes, and especially the constantly evolving setting. I loved the way the show reveals information about the world periodically and usually in subtle ways. Whether it be a brief line said quietly by the outsider Lykos or the interesting but vicious psychopaths who invade the Mud Whale. Through meeting new people the islanders broaden their horizons and even the physical island undergoes an evolution. And the way that the Mud Whale actually changes is so satisfying to watch. We see the Mud Whalers live in blissful ignorance in their \"utopian\" society, then eventually the image is cathartically shattered and their whole world is altered irreparably. \\n\\n\r\nI never felt like the show wasted my time. From the first minutes of episode one, it grabbed me with the emotion hook and a society cut-off from the world. Then onward I was getting info on the world that I was already very interested in! If you're not grabbed by the show from the first episode you probably never will be. It's a sad truth that makes the show more niche than it needed to be. I'm hoping enough fans find it to warrant a sequel because the story isn't over yet. \\n\\n\r\nThe one small gripe I had with the story was how the pace is a bit on the quick side. I liked how it never felt like the show was dragging on, but honestly, I wouldn\u2019t have had a problem with more slow scenes to get more of the little details about the Mud Whale I felt were missing from the show. The dialogue is typically quite simplistic, which may bother some viewers. I rarely found annoying given that it allows for the many interesting themes to be visible and easily analyzable. \\n\\n\r\n[Character: 8/10]\\n\r\nThe characters have visible arcs that meld them into the sort of believable people you can root for.\\n\r\nThe mud-whalers start out as bumbling idiots, unable to comprehend the danger they are in. After they experience a devastating tragedy (which I won't reveal) the entire ship undergoes a change. They train and prepare themselves, it was cathartic to see them go from fools who thought they were in control, to wise and determined fighters who understood the struggle they had to endure in order to survive. Watching the three lead characters, Chakuro, Ouni, and Lykos develop is where most of the show\u2019s engagement is derived from. All of them have interesting backstories that are explored in the show. As if they were magnets, the more they experience the more through learning from each other and the tragic events they experience, their characters progress in visible ways. The friends of the main three characters also have individual arcs. This sense of character progression really made the main cast endearing to watch, I was rooting for them all by the end despite a few duds in the roster.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve seen the protagonist Chakuro get criticised for being kind of a wimp. To that I say, he\u2019s meant to be like that. This isn\u2019t some shounen power fantasy. It\u2019s shoujo. The male characters show plenty of emotion and cry just as much as the female ones. Some people might hate this but I found it incredibly refreshing to see this level of sensitivity, it really helped make the show\u2019s theme of emotions believable. I did have a rather large issue with the characters that prevented me from giving them a full score. It\u2019s made clear at the start of the show that there are so many people living in Mud Whale, but as the show goes on it pulls from this unknown amount of random people to use as accessories to the main characters. Instead of killing main cast members these randos are killed nearby the leads, which does add a little bit to the tension. I felt like whenever these characters were added into the lead cast pool I knew they\u2019d be the first to die, just an unnecessary layer of predictability.\\n\\n\r\nThe fantastic world building is extended to the characters due to how well rooted in the world they all are. Citizens of the Mud Whale feel like they belong there. For example; we see that the Mud Whalers don\u2019t get much punishment because there\u2019s almost no crime, which explains why they\u2019re all so carefree and lack a whole lot of respect for the rules and the elders that wrote them. Some of the citizens hate the Mud Whale for how small and closed off it is. Just simply knowing this detail about them makes them all the more believable. I feel similar to the characters who despised their birthplace so even though they don\u2019t get a whole lot of development I was able to connect with them and place myself in their shoes. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the villains, the majority of them are the murderous invaders of the Mud Whale. \\n\r\nWhat the invaders lack in charisma they more than make up for in introspection. Their quiet, logic-based demeanors clash with the emotion-fueled personas of the Mud Whalers. Their motivations make sense from a utilitarian perspective, but put yourself in their shoes long enough and you\u2019ll hate yourself for understanding their beliefs. There were a few standout villains like the visually distinct pink haired Ryodari. He has emotions but due to the society he lives in he has become something of an outcast. His arc becomes visible during the middle half of the show and after that, he becomes a reoccurring character to give the audience an insightful look at life outside of the Mud Whale. \\n\\n\r\n[Art: 8/10]\\n\r\nDespite taking place in a world made of mostly sand and mud, the show is visually breathtaking. The characters look good enough if a bit similar, varying hair colors liven the mostly sand color palette. The hair coupled with vibrantly blue sky gives the world a lot of vibrancy due to the contrast. It occasionally feels like the characters are individual objects to the environments, as they have different visual styles. When a gust of wind sweeps glittering sand across the screen or the mud whalers use saimia they look like they belong in that world, but sadly there are a few moments that didn\u2019t sit right with me. But even during the low points, the show is still stunning and it held my attention constantly. \\n\\n\r\nHaving read the first volume of the manga I can say that the show feels like the manga put in motion as accurately as possible, but sometimes this problematic for the director. Some static scenes in the manga would be transferred into static scenes in the show with a bit of animation of the characters but the background details would be totally unmoving. Making it feel like you\u2019re watching a picture book. Most of these issues are in the earlier episodes when the show is a bit less dynamic, either way, it\u2019s always visually appealing even it takes a little while for the director to find the right way to frame the show.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 9/10]\\n\r\nAn uplifting folky opening starts off each episode with some really thought-provoking lyrics that allude to the evolution the Mud Whale undertakes. I love the orchestral soundtrack to Children of the Whales. It always seems to reflect not only the emotion of a scene but the atmosphere and location of the scene. Great insert songs during titular moments to really hammer home the importance of those scenes. They do a good job of defining a turning point in the story but their mellowness is gentle on the ears.\\n\r\nStrong voice acting, but I\u2019ll be on the lookout for Netflix\u2019s English dub in the near future as they tend to be well cast.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 8.5/10]\\n\r\nMystifying and almost religious atmosphere to the show. The way that the director hangs on certain shots to highlight their importance, cutting out all sound, and giving you time to understand the what makes that shot so titular. \\n\\n\r\nIn the earlier episodes, I was incredibly frustrated at how the Mud Whalers become paralyzed whenever confronted with danger. I understand that in their utopian society they never faced war, but it was painful to watch. It wasn\u2019t helped by the fact that those scenes were dragged on a lot more than they were in the manga. Thankfully this issue is addressed later on in a satisfying way that I\u2019d rather not reveal for the sake of keeping this review spoiler-free. A few annoying pacing issues during the first half of the show that didn\u2019t affect the overall story but hindered some scenes moment-to-moment enjoyment. This is most likely due to the director struggling to find the right length of time to hang on a specific shot. In the second half of the show, I noticed significantly fewer issues and plenty of impressively delivered moments. Sometimes the director hangs on specific shots of characters to convey a sense of weight during turning points of the story.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall I was impressed more than bothered. Some people might not care about those minor issues but those that do will probably have no trouble getting past them once they see the show\u2019s other merits. \\n\\n\r\nScore Breakdown:\\n\r\n[Story: 8] Great world building, high rewatch value, rewarding twists.\\n\r\n[Character: 8] Constantly evolving main characters, large supporting cast.\\n\r\n[Art: 8] Pretty visuals but characters look too independent of the backgrounds.\\n\r\n[Sound: 9] Great music and op/ed, nice insert songs, solid voice work.\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 8.5] Frustrating at times, but gripping in the end.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall: 8.3/10]\\n\r\nThe audiovisual splendor of Children of the Whales grabbed my attention immediately, but as it continued on I saw there was more to it than met the eyes. I'll admit that it's niche as hell and as such many people won't get into it. If the first episode sinks its hooks in you, then chances are you'll find the journey the characters and world undergo to be an incredibly rewarding one.",

Most(if not all) of them are very generic tropes with generic designs, some of they do have interesting traits, but they're left pretty undeveloped, and most of those characters exist for pretty much no reason. Seriously, there's an absurd amount of character's being introduced at a nonstop pace, and we don't  know (or remember) most of their names, which makes it even harder for the somewhat interesting characters to have any development, most of those characters will probably be killed at some point (they already started being killed actually), and that's also a problem, since we know nothing about they and have no reason to care about the main characters because of how superficial they are.\\n\\n\r\nThere are even some small details that apparently are plot holes, since i doubt they'll ever be explained, but i don't want to give spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has a lot of obvious issues, and i don't think i can recommend it to anyone, unless you want to look at some gorgeous artwork, but you'll probably end up being betrayed by it.\\n",

            "content": "Watching shoujo fantasy adventures these days feels like taking a dive into a video game world. When Kujira no Kora Wa Sujou ni Utau (Children of the Whales) began airing, I had a strange instinct about the show. It felt like an anime that really wanted us to really embrace its ideas but fell short on capitalizing on all of them.\r\nCreated by Abi Umeda, few people probably heard of the author\u2019s name. Taking a close look at their resume, some of their work consists of horror genre series. Crafting a shoujo fantasy adventure sounded like a challenge. However, I will say this: the author decidedto mold a variety of themes together that felt different from some of the other shoujo fantasy series I\u2019ve seen in the past. To be clear, I think this show is suited for an audience beyond just the female demographic.\\n\\n\r\nAre you the target audience? Let\u2019s test that theory. Do you enjoy watching a show with colorful world fiction? How about a show with a large cast of characters? Or conflicts involving a utopia certainly thrown into turmoil? If any of these are on your bucket list, then definitely give it a try. That being said, the main attraction on paper is so far the setting. Mud Whale is really a unique dynamic that will draw attention. In an endless sea of sand of the Sand Era, Mud Whale is a moving vessel composed of an unique civilization. There are the \u201cmarked ones\u201d who are individuals with psychokinetic powers but have a short life span. On the other hand, there are the \u201cunmarked ones\u201d, individuals who possesses no powers but have longer life spans. It\u2019s interesting to note that these people live in isolation so they know nothing about the outside world. The plot involves a mysterious girl named Lykos as she changes the lives of everyone on Mud Whale.\\n\\n\r\nAs a 1-cour adaptation running for 12 episodes, I was a bit worried. Before even watching, I had to be less optimistic because it meant the likely event that the show will omit content and also leave questions for the viewers. Unfortunately, that came to be the case after this series ended. It felt like an advertisement of the manga and wants the audience\u2019s hunger for more. As a manga reader, I am thankful that the anime adapted the story consistently with what the overall tone of the setting. But for the overall story, it really felt lacking. My early impression of the show kept me wanting for more though. The first few episodes established the setting and really gives a feel of a shoujo fantasy adventure. We have the characters living their lives in harmony as part of a utopia. Despite being isolated, they behave like humans and have their own system like the council, battle platoons, and recreational services. That changes after Lykos makes her appearance with Mud Whale while bringing attention from outsiders. It transformed the show from a harmonious story into one with dramatic conflicts. This elevates into bloodshed, pain, and even death. \\n\\n\r\nNow as I watched more of this series, I accepted that only the main core characters will get their spotlight. The ones you see on the key visuals includes Chakuro, Lykos, Ouni, Suou, Ginshu, Ryodari, and Sami. Chakuro is the main guy who bears a gentle personality. This is a contrast to characters such as the emotionless Lykos and cold hearted Ouni. While I can\u2019t say Chakuro is an impressive protagonist on paper, he is able to influence others such as Lykos throughout the show. The two forges a unique bond after the two begins to understand each other more. However, the anime doesn\u2019t go too far into developing their relationship nor does it explore them individually as characters. It\u2019s sad to realize this but I think omitting characterization makes the characters harder to accept. For the others, they play a variety of roles such as Suou becoming a leader, Ouni as the rigid combatant, or Ginshu as a guard of Mud Whale. It\u2019s also noticeable that even deceased characters in the series has some influence on the present story. This is especially true when applied to characters like Chakuro as death affects his mentality. Meanwhile, I can\u2019t say the antagonists of the series are appealing. The most noticeable one to point fingers at is Ryodari, the pink haired child soldier. We only see a glimpse of his past but it\u2019s shown that he is clearly unstable and has a thirst to kill for the thrill of it. It lacks any depth in characterization and really doesn\u2019t make him feel believable as a character. Indeed, the characters in the show is a mixed bag. As I watched more and more of this series, it felt like the creator didn\u2019t really put too much thought into making them.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the experience I got from watching this anime felt rather memorable at times. The drama brings a reality to death and there\u2019s a sense of tragedy that can send chills down the spine. While character chemistry isn\u2019t always meaningful, it does have a way to express itself and evoke emotions. The vulnerability of the characters is clear and it shouldn\u2019t take long for viewers to discover how death affects them. While it is also a shoujo, don\u2019t expect romance to actually develop though. It serves more as a genre to carry the style of the story. The mystery elements develops more and more as the story progresses but don\u2019t expect answers to everything. It\u2019s explored through some background storytelling but will still leave viewers to their imaginations.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by J.C. Staff, this anime really stood out in the artwork department. A utopia like Mud Whale is depicted as a perfect society and before the events of Lyko\u2019s encounter, it really does look like one. From the simple character outfits to natural spectacles, it\u2019s a sight to feast eyes on. Mud Whale itself is also decorated with colorful features such as the sand particles, atypical structure, and natural aesthetics. The world fiction gives the impression of what a fantasy shoujo should be with the endless sand. It feels like a vast open world video game. Character designs also makes quite an impression as a majority of the cast are children. It gives off a sense of innocence, vulnerability, and youth. There\u2019s also violence so do expect action to pick up once the conflicts really gets going. The amount of blood isn\u2019t presented as shock value but more as a way to illustrate the reality of death. Fan service isn\u2019t explicit but does also exist with bath scenes so be on the lookout for that.\\n\\n\r\nBeautiful and harmonious. That\u2019s how I\u2019d describe the theme songs of the show and overall tone of the OST. The technical elements of the soundtrack is outstanding to fit with the genres of this anime. Sound director Jin Aketagawa (known for his work on some other fantasy series) impressed me with the overall direction. The synchronization of the soundtrack with some of the more emotional scenes made them feel impactful. Not to mention, there\u2019s also harmonious singing in the show that really took my attention. Character voice mannerism can be a mixed bag at times. Lykos is too emotionless to be memorable while most of the younger characters all sound the same. Ryodari takes his personality often too far to be declared impressive.\\n\\n\r\nAdapting a shoujo fantasy adventure isn\u2019t easy but the final product that came to be felt like it\u2019s missing something. Whether it\u2019s the weak characterization or underdeveloped plot is up for you to decide. It definitely has visual splendor though and sells its setting convincingly to viewers. I just wish they took more time to expand the story and characters to really capitalize on this series as a whole. To me, this is a show that needed more passion to bring audience for appreciation.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The best fantastic adventures take you to cool worlds full of cool characters, and, fortunately for everybody involved, Children of the Whales does just that. Anybody who is a fan of mystery, fantasy, psychological themes, and beautiful artwork should most definitely check this show out!\r\nStory:\r\n A quiet and tranquil ship called the Mud Whale full of short-lived psychokinetics and a handful of boring normies with longer lifespans drifts aimlessly on an endless sea of sand. Barring a few troublemakers the people of the Mud Whale are (mostly) happy in what seems to be a utopian commune of sorts. Unexpected contact with the outside world revealsthat things on the Mud Whale are not as simple and benign as they initially seem, and soon the passengers of the Mud Whale are forced to confront a world that doesn't much resemble the paradise they know. Chakuro (our hero and the archivist of the ship) and his friends must struggle against the pressure of a vast, hostile, and unknown world if they want to continue to live their peaceful lives.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt's beautiful, it's perfect, it looks like Linda Evangelista. This show is gorgeous to look at, and a couple seconds should be enough to convince anybody with working eyes of that fact. It has a muted, watercolor look that keeps the atmosphere very tranquil even when some serious shit starts going down. In fact, the mellow art makes the serious shit all the more serious by comparison. The way this show is drawn and animated would reason enough to watch it even if the story was garbage, and as the story is also great you really have no excuse not to.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe only part of the show that isn't amazing. It's good, don't get me wrong, especially the OP. It's just not as perfect as the art and the story. Nothing to sneeze at, but certainly nothing to write home about. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nReally really good. Chakuro, our main character, is something of a wet blanket at first, but he grows a backbone as the story progresses and he is forced to start standing up for himself and his family. Lykos, a mysterious stranger from abroad, starts off as an emotionally dead husk and fairly quickly becomes a really badass little girl. Kinda like anime Eleven from Stranger Things. Other characters of note include Ouni, the rebellious angsty teenaged shit-stirrer, Sami, the plucky (almost) girlfriend of our protagonist, and Suou, one of the non-psychokenetic individuals on the Mud Whale who is being groomed to become the next chief of the ship. A plethora of side characters, each interesting and dynamic in their own right, help the Mud Whale feel like a lived-in community filled with real people. This, of course, serves to make the fact that they are about to get their shit kicked in all the more tragic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\r\nThis show is great. It is going to be a fun and colorful adventure full of complex characters, tough decisions, and really beautifully animated fights, scenery, and characters. The world is cool, the characters are vibrant, the visual is spectacular, and the episodes have a natural dramatic tension that is very exciting to watch unfold. Fans of other awesome fantasy/mysteries like From the New World (Shinsekai Yori), Dennou Coil, Uta Kata, and Made in Abyss will really get a kick out of this show. If you have no idea what any of that stuff is, watch this show anyway. You'll love it. And then, if you do, watch that other shit too. Cause you'll like that as well.",

            "content": "If you asked anyone to describe Children of the Whales, they would probably call it a tragedy. The people that enjoyed it would say it\u2019s a heartbreaking tragedy filled with death and agony, a show packed with emotion. The people that disliked it would call it a tragedy in a more literal sense, and personally I agree with them. With boring and unexplored characters, predictable and badly paced drama, and a dollop of plot armour to top it all off, Children of the Whales manages to mess up almost every part of what could have made it an interesting watch.\r\nOur MC for the show Chakurofeels like a misplaced side character given a slight power boost. He doesn\u2019t do much but survive the whole ordeal and worry about everything, making him completely irrelevant to the story. Our converted enemy Lykos is only around for plot progression, occasionally rising up to be important and then shrinking back into a somewhat empty cast member. The real MC Ouni is the one that holds the most importance and gets explored more than every other character, but for some reason, the show continues to brush him aside so our two less interesting mascots Chakuro and Lykos can take over.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast are only around to create drama, make stupid decisions, and die when needed. I can\u2019t count the amount of faceless blobs of mass that have lost their lives in a desperate attempt to suck out some fragment of despair from its audience. It tries to make us feel attached to people while making no attempt to actually allow us to get to know any of them. There are a few people that the show deems to be of some worth for whatever reason, so it keeps them alive with the wonderful power of plot armour and convenience. Instead of enemies killing them instantly like they do with every other unlucky soul, they take their time to have a little conversation to reveal some plot points, allowing our good guys to make it out alive so they can again be unimportant.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about dying, the drama is a collection of the most predictable situations I have ever seen. You can see almost everything coming from a mile away, and when the show does try to surprise you, the horrid pacing stops you from giving a single shit about each lacklustre episode. Add in the already mentioned plot armour and character stupidity and you are left with massacre after massacre that carry no meaning other than to be a cheap emotional scene for us to sigh over. The only parts that carry any impact are centred around Ouni dealing with his history as a mole rat and him trying to protect his friends. However, the pacing and plot armour still brought it down quite significantly. The story could have made a comeback if it had just played its cards right. To make it even worse, the story ends right when everything is building up for a major arc, just to throw the cherry on the mess that was supposed to be a cake.\\n\\n\r\nNow the two biggest problems I have with this anime are the plot holes and singing. The show states that the Allied Empire, the antagonists of the show, is a country filled with emotionless citizens for reasons explained in the show. Emotionless characters are a tough thing to write so many opt to go with characters that start off emotionless and slowly learn to have human feelings, with even Children of the Whales trying (and failing) this with Lykos. However, the supposedly blank slates that our good guys fight against sure seem to be pretty human to me. Showing signs of fear, desires, and ambition, it\u2019s really frustrating having the show keep telling you that they are emotionless when they are clearly not.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the bloody singing. Why does the show think it\u2019s alright to break out into songs during the middle of a battlefield? Are they trying to make the show seem more deep and dark with a random sad musical playing over some the serious scenes of the anime? I\u2019m trying to find a reason to like this show but it decides to make up for its terrible drama by distracting us with a little singalong. What the legit fuck? It annoys me so much to see something so out of place in an already bad anime.\\n\\n\r\nChildren of the Whales is a show that deserves little praise. It is a massive disappoint that it\u2019s only redeeming point is that it looks nice. No one cares about how good a show looks if the story going alongside it is subpar. Avoid this show, move past it and find something that\u2019s actually worth putting your time into, because this show is just a waste of time.",

            "content": "I love everything about this anime. It is probably one of the most interesting, innovative and well-made shoujos I have ever seen in my life. I was anxious to be able to watch it and now I feel that all my expectations are being fulfilled very well. And I'm still being surprised. \r\nArt (10)\r\nThe first thing I wanted to mention about it, is the beauty of the drawing and the color palette. The colors are mostly very soft, pastel tones, giving a more innocent and pure connotation for the protagonist characters. The antagonists, in turn, always receive stronger colors - I found this quite interesting.In addition, colors also direct well the emotions that viewers must feel: sad themes lead to environments in navy blue, joyful themes ranges from an orange rose to all the colors of the rainbow. It's just beautiful to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe character traits are all super delicate - from the strands of hair to the minutest details of the eyes, the clothes and even the movement of the wind. Even before the series was released, it was this delicacy that made me super excited to be able to follow the anime. I admit: it is my weakness. The way the studio stayed true to Umeda Abi's art style made me very happy too. She is a wonderful mangaka. I really, really loved the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10)\\n\r\nThe second thing I wanted to mention is the wonderful soundtrack. A lot of people don't pay much attention to this kind of detail, but I'm completely in love with the entire OST without even having access to the media yet. It's the kind of OST that I definitely have the interest to get for my collection. And the ending theme! Oh goddess, I love this song. Rionos' voice is simply angelic, this song always gives me goosebumps. The lyrics of the song are very cute and practically whispered, harmonizing a lot with the soft tone that the anime passes, the idea of \u200b\u200bpurity and sadness. \\n\\n\r\nStory (9)\\n\r\nThe story is a bit hazy at first and is being built slowly, like a puzzle. To the present moment, I am giving it a 9 because I still don't know the end of it. I hope it continues to surprise me positively. But it's worth the rate because it's the kind of plot you normally expect from a shounen manga, an adventure full of tragic and even violent twists.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8)\\n\r\nThe characters follow a similar path of history: they are all poorly developed. The story focuses on Chakuro, the narrator, but it explores a bit of several other characters, so it leaves little room for deeper development. The viewer knows the names of the characters, whether they are ordinary humans or controllers of thymia and in some cases, a bit of the past of one or another. But yet their emotions - or their lack - are so well worked out that it also thrills you. Again, I hope to continue to be positively surprised in this regard. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, I may sound a bit partial here because I love their design, but there's no way you can watch this series and not want to hug Chakuro and protect him from all the malice in the world. They are all just adorable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall (9)\\n\r\nI'm having loads of fun and getting lots of excitement too. I love these silly and delicate stories involving human feelings, thematizing individual freedom, the value of life and friendship. This story is a root shoujo (which means it couldn't be more original to the genre, I guess)!\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you like shoujo stories like I do, I'm pretty sure you are going to like this one quite much.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nWhales are intelligent, majestic creatures. Rulers of the sea by size and by power.\r\nIn comparison, Kujira no Kora wa Sajou ni Utau has no size. It has no power.\r\nAll it really rules over is the bottom of the ocean \u2013 right where it belongs.\r\nSTORY\r\nCredit where credit is due: Kujira no Kora (as it will be shortened to from here on out) contains a neat premise what with its expanse of sand, an inexplicable titan, and the cultural norms it creates. It at least has the footing necessary to get the ball rolling (or, in thiscase, get the \u201cboat\u201d rowing).\\n\\n\r\nBut as a narrative, as a story, this whole venture sinks rather than swims.\\n\\n\r\nMajor issues reveal themselves swiftly and without remorse. For instance, the bad guys have a weird tendency to just not really do anything in situations where they clearly have the upper hand, turning specific events into an excuse to push the plot in a certain direction rather than into intense moments that allow it to develop naturally. Moreover, hardly anything is known about these adversaries since the show will go long stretches without talking about them or at least referring to them, missing out on crucial exploration of their side.\\n\\n\r\nThe trading of information also encounters trouble. Characters like Lykos will hold onto vital clues for very little reason other than to obstruct the narrative. Then, in complete opposite fashion, someone like Aima will descend in front of Chakuro to give him her umpteenth example of deus ex machina so that the plot at least \u201cmakes sense\u201d when going to its next part.\\n\\n\r\nQuotes must be used there since Kujira no Kora often treads into nonsensical territory. Random characters, such as the older elders, appear and disappear out of nowhere. Certain interactions, such as Chakuro speaking with one of the Nous directly, involves incredulous logic. Important changes, such as Ouni\u2019s newfound powers, have miniscule impact in the aftermath of their discovery.\\n\\n\r\nThis systemic plague within the writing festers and oozes its way into the more fundamental aspects of the show. An excessive amount of exposition bogs down the flow, and pacing can get too quick which hinders events. There\u2019s also the intermittent comedic relief. It stilts the tone since people are literally dead or dying and such jokey asides clash hard with the serious morbidity.\\n\\n\r\nEven disregarding the comedy, Kujira no Kora breaks apart with its drama and its action, the areas that make up the bulk of its story.\\n\\n\r\nOn the drama side, it\u2019s tough to care about the loss of life which occurs. It tries to be emotional insofar as those who perish usually represent major figures in the lives of those nearby, but the lacking presence of these people to begin with prevents the drama from landing.\\n\\n\r\nOn the action side, not enough happens to justify the skirmishes. Those who are Marked have essentially magical powers, but their abilities and their usage rarely (if ever) aim for an interesting angle let alone reach memorable status.\\n\\n\r\nProblem after problem hounds this story nearly every step of the way. It\u2019s largely incompetent, and its premise simply cannot carry the glaring mishaps and the ludicrous inadequacies that weigh it down. This vessel doesn\u2019t just sink; it implodes.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show may not recover from the damage to its narrative, Kujira no Kora at least dazzles with the artistry at its disposal.\\n\\n\r\nChief among its wonders is the color palate. The anime opts for a watery fade to achieve its softer hues, coinciding with the sea motif and forming the watercolor looks for many of its visuals. It also chooses much lighter colors in general: pinks, teals, yellows. They add a vibrant contrast not only to the darker blues and purples but also to the overall darkness of the mood at hand.\\n\\n\r\nThe rocky outcropping the characters call home also gets attention. Craggy walls and earthen stone encase their lodgings. Rudimentary holes act as rough windows. Quaint amenities line their rooms. Vegetation on other floating islands and the regal cities of the \u201cnormal\u201d people have a place, but this monolith of mud and clay captures the rustic intent of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCombining the colors and the setting provides the show with ample opportunities to highlight the beauty of this world. Again, it almost never leaves the static ruins of their roaming giant. Yet, when a sunset casts light on their abode or dancing lights flicker in the nighttime air, it becomes easier to forgive the stale variety and to appreciate these gorgeous segments.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the art and the artistry often impress, the more nuanced, technical side of things isn\u2019t as captivating. Cinematography remains standard for many of its scenes, and the actual animation during bouts or as they go about their daily lives stays relatively straightforward.\\n\\n\r\nKujira no Kora prevails with other details, though. The designs for its characters fit the scope and the lore of their era and their culture as loose clothes, accessories, sandals, and other simplistic garb invoke a native feel to their looks. And above them, a painted, almost canvas-esque sky stays aligned with the painted vibe of the art, granting an awe in all directions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime contains some rather good artistry. One can\u2019t complain too much here.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe characters within Kujira no Kora, however, cannot evade complaints.\\n\\n\r\nChakuro takes the helm of this \u201cship\u201d as the lead star and the narrator, speaking of his account aboard their home and his knowledge of the Falaina people (i.e., his people). However, he\u2019s entirely too passive to be considered a worthwhile character within the anime. Not that being passive is inherently a problem; it\u2019s that that\u2019s all he is.\\n\\n\r\nHe\u2019s a writer at heart, so it\u2019s understandable that he stays on the sidelines during fights (even if he\u2019s apparently a very strong thymia user) since he has little in the way of battle training. But he contributes almost nothing else. He watches events play out, and he cries a lot, yet he just laments the situation and goes along with nearly everything that happens around him.\\n\\n\r\nDeaths of dear friends do affect him, so he\u2019s at least attuned with the gravity of their dilemma. That\u2019s not saying a whole lot, however, when he won\u2019t speak up even if he knows the causes behind it. Worse yet, Chakuro will constantly talk about wishing to record the stories of his people for historical purposes episode after episode, but his progress on this front must be minimal because Kujira no Kora rarely showcases him doing as such. I.e., he talks the talk but does not walk the walk.\\n\\n\r\nChakuro is so bland and so useless that it\u2019s a miracle to see him connected to this story whatsoever. Lykos is a walking blob of a character, too. She begins as a blank slate of sorts, harboring almost zero emotion when Chakuro and the others find her. Meaning, the anime primes her for an interesting arc to follow throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nTrue to its trends, though, Lykos succumbs to the same problems of overt passivity and minute contributions. She receives a tiny bit of backstory near her introduction, and she\u2019s related to the main baddy, but the extent of her presence stops there. She barely says or does anything meaningful despite her growing emotions.\\n\\n\r\nLykos maybe-possibly develops feelings for Chakuro, indicating her recent changes on a psychological level. Sadly, their relationship neither goes anywhere meaningful, has a resolute foundation, nor is challenged to any significant extent. That is to say, just as they are individually depleted as characters, the bond they share turns hallow as well.\\n\\n\r\nBesides these two leads, Kujira no Kora includes side characters who likewise fail to meet a proper spot. Shuan, the eyepatch guy, is the outlier amongst everyone insofar as he cares not for anything, including (apparently) his own wife. But he\u2019s almost too much of an outsider, leading his small asides to register as inconsequential moments without much follow-through. Then there\u2019s the purple-hair goofball who gets some pretty vital backstory right before a key scene in his arc. It demonstrates a complete lameness in the character writing, aggravated further by his absurd motivations.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the only two notable characters in the show are Suou and Ouni.\\n\\n\r\nSuou becomes the voice of reason whose nonviolent ideologies struggle against the fear and the hatred which brews in the hearts of his fellow thymia users. He\u2019s the anchor of hope that the rest of the characters look up to, a mature person who himself has a lot left to learn. As a supporting character, he\u2019s at least beneficial to the ensuing plot.\\n\\n\r\nOuni is arguably the most well-written character in Kujira no Kora, but it\u2019s still a weak and precarious backing. The anime sets up him as a conflicted anti-hero who inspires everyone to fight back and who cares deeply for the misfits he has befriended over the years. His never-ending angst and his much-to-be-desired backstory don\u2019t do him any favors, but the personal troubles he endures push him down the right path. A statement that cannot be said for the other two main characters.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Suou and Ouni find themselves drowned out by a mixed bag of other additions to the cast. Sami enlightens the audience to the harshness of their world, Hakuji shows how people can redeem themselves yet, and Masoo reminds everyone of the unfair toll they have burdened. On the opposite side, Oruka is an annoyingly blas\u00e9 villain in need of depth, and the latecomers from the new country arrive way too late indeed.\\n\\n\r\nFor these characters, it\u2019s mostly just a wash.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nA cleansing of the audio is also required for Kujira no Kora.\\n\\n\r\nAt the minimum, its opening track \u201cSono Saki e\u201d harbors a hefty emotional tone that strikes at the bittersweet layer permeated throughout the anime. The tender female vocals and the light acoustic guitar strings work in unison to meld this mood, relying on the drums and the shakers for a steady rhythm. It\u2019s perhaps slightly repetitive in its structure, but poignant delivery for many of its lyrics supplant this grievance.\\n\\n\r\nThe tail end of each episode brings the ending track \u201cHashitairo\u201d, another song aiming for that bittersweet tone. However, it dives into it with more gusto. Female vocals and acoustic guitar strings return alongside piano keys, extra backing vocals, and violins to emphasize the bitter half of the term. Unlike the OP, this ED skirts around repetition, yet the middle section of the track meanders to a questionable degree. Still, the poetic, story-like lyrics introduce a complexity that befits the song\u2019s equally complex emotions.\\n\\n\r\nWhile neither the OP nor the ED stand out as too impressive, they at least do not go down the contemptable route of its semi-insert songs. Over the course of Kujira no Kora, a few musical numbers per se pop up to crescendo as sweeping emotional points in the story. Per usual, though, they fall flat. Sometimes they\u2019re way too out of place, like as the prelude to a battle about to commence. Sometimes they\u2019re too methodical, like as the beginning of the end to the story\u2019s conclusion. Whether melancholic or uplifting in nature, these songs are easily the worst audio decisions in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the rest of the audio elements simply pass the mark. Heavy cellos and quicker instrumentation coincide with the somber and tenser parts of the anime (respectively), but the collection of tracks it touts leave behind nothing all that memorable. The voice-acting performances similarly lose out on any standout mentions. And the sound-effects, regardless of the thymia possibilities, remain par for the course.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the music and the sound fairs slightly better than the other aspects of Kujira no Kora, but it ends up in the red anyway.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nTo say I disliked this anime would be an understatement.\\n\\n\r\nThe weaknesses throughout the season were already enough to make it a soured and sorrowful experience, but the anime goes that extra step further with some more baffling choices. Key among them involves a certain purple-hair antagonistic who shall go unnamed still for being absolutely insufferable.\\n\\n\r\nJim Carrey as the Grinch put it best: \u201cLoathe entirely\u201d describes this annoying, eye-rolling, grating nuisance of a character (intentional or not). Yet the show steps it up again by making him into a literal personal jester later on, increasing his loathsome behavior to another level after what should have been his leave. He pretty much deserved such a fate for being a psychopathic lunatic, but, having hit maximum on the hated scale beforehand, he breaks it afterwards. He has now become one of my least favorite characters I\u2019ve ever had the displeasure of viewing onscreen, and I pray I never have to see him mentioned anywhere ever again.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, I couldn\u2019t take the anime very seriously at all. There\u2019s a distinct part in episode five that is one of the most unintentionally hilarious moments I\u2019ve ever seen in a long time, if not ever. The Nous creature gets hit by an arrow, and its reaction is priceless. The scream, the eyes, the camera zooming in and out. It was a trifecta of funny that wasn\u2019t meant to be so but got there anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAlso why would throwing sand at each other equate to a worthwhile pastime for these stranded people? I get that they must be bored out of their minds out there, but the fact that nobody seems to question such a dangerous activity comes off as irrational.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I\u2019m being nitpicky over such a tiny detail, but it just goes to show how frustrating this whole project ended up being for me. It\u2019s empty. It\u2019s inane to watch. It\u2019s borderline bottom of the barrel.\\n\\n\r\nWhen this one did finally wrap up, it boldly declared that, \u201cThe journey will continue.\u201d I can acknowledge its confidence for future success \u2013 but that\u2019s as far as I\u2019m willing to extend my olive branch.\\n\\n\r\nKujira no Kora wa Sajou ni Utau fails miserably. Like a golden toilet, it shines on the outside thanks to its beautiful art, but, on the inside, it contains excrement in the form of poor narrative writing, odd musical choices, lame characters, and unappealing entertainment. A whale of a time it is not.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, a ridiculous enemy, improper plot handling, nonsensical happenings, fundamental problems, and an uninteresting direction sink its maiden voyage\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Good, vibrant colors and a painted style give the visuals a gorgeous look even if the more technical traits like cinematography and movement do not impress\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Chakuro and Lykos are horrible protagonists, Suou and Ouni have a mediocre presence, and the remaining supporting and extra cast members lean towards the weak, negative side\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Bad, the OP and the ED demonstrate emotion, but the absurd singing moments and the rest of the lackluster audio elements fail to contribute\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Terrible, has one of the most annoying characters ever seen, laughable when it doesn\u2019t intend to be, and increasingly frustrating the further along it proceeds\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 2/10",

            "content": "On paper, Kujira no Kora wa Sajou ni Utau, or Children Of The Whales, seems promising at first glance, but on screen, as you follow the story of people learning to disregard their emotions (LITERALLY being kuuderes) as a means to survive in a place full of contraptions and controversies amidst the fast-pacing that it has, it becomes over and underwhelming of the overall production value in and itself.\r\nStory & Characters:\r\nIn a world of humans, more specifically the land of Falaina, the sinner's land, people are categorized as Unmarked and Marked according to whether thymia exists within them (which act as their superpowers), with theUnmarked having none of that thymia while being able to live longer and the Marked having thymia but with a shorter lifespan. And the third realm, the rare Daimon (Ouni's power) is able to inflict great power while also being able to live for long.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a journey of the Mud Whale and its archivist, our MC 14 year-old Chakuro exploring the realms of Falaina, learning its actions and discoveries...until the encountering of another country with another MC Lykos, which she is a kuudere since the Nous (heart of the ships) has sucked the emotions out of the people, and has become deaf towards emotions and won't sound out towards the Mud Whale people.\\n\\n\r\nHere's where the problem starts, as the intro towards Lykos meant that the people of Falaina (particularly the main protagonist Ouni and his band of mercenaries) knew that they aren't alone, the Empire Strikes Back (get the pun?) with a slew of side characters from both the Empire (the Skylos ship) and the Mud Whale fighting against each other, like as if the scenes are there for you to get emotionally drifted with whatever the storyline goes, but it doesn't work for me, even as a very emotional person, it doesn't captivate me as much as other shows have had done in their own unique way that really stands out.\\n\\n\r\nEven worse, most notably characters like the annoying no-mercy pink-haired Ryodari just doesn't work out for me, it's like \"Can someone please eliminate this bastard once and for all!?\", and the unrequited lover Sami that has an affection for Chakuro, only to be his sacrifice, IN TURN which is supposed to repress the emotions of Chakuro and us the audience.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, while the story presentation does have flaws in which the insane amount of characters make up for it, the execution however feels mildly presentable at its finest and becomes a horrible mess towards the end, where I find myself scratching my head always to understand what the hell is going on here towards the ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nOne thing I can give credit to J.C.Staff for is that cel-shading art and glorious animation, because there is really nothing like it out there, and it sticks out with it having one of the best productions that they have done over the years, and really that's no consolation for the entirety of the show overall, because the potentials given and shown here just makes up for the lackluster storytelling, and there in itself, presents another problem to an already existing problem on hand. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nto be honest, I'm not fond of the OST here, and since this show displays a barrage of emotions, the OP and ED are there to introduce you to a realistic feeling of emotions when used well and otherwise. The BGM does a decent job in fulfilling and showcasing the characters at their highs and lows and for the intense and solemn moments of joy and despair. Sadly, the ED is the only good point which I can say it's nice to listen to, even though some will disagree with that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThe make-or-break part is with the ending \"the journey with continue\" (Spoilers alert) on whether J.C.Staff will continue with another season to clearify all the loopholes and misunderstandings that we have with this series as a whole, because so far, this has been a very jam-packed series, with the manga counterpart still ongoing, and it's like ending on a note that's not even far from what we feel is the \"true\" ending.\\n\\n\r\nOn this note however, if you're willing to try this show out, just go in with a mysterious feel, and don't expect much from something that at one point, may have your heartstrings pulled and another, just to wreck that ball of emotions away. Decent, but not entertaining to re-watch this again.",

            "content": "Children of the Mud Whale is a beautiful show with an interesting world that is a complete waste of time. Most of us watched it for the pretty background art and fascinating concept, but it fails miserably to deliver on these.\r\nStory: 3\r\n3 is a bit generous and is there solely because of 1) a death early on that caught me by surprise, and 2) the world building. Mud Whale has an interesting world, with whale/ships powered by grotesque monstrosities on a sand ocean. There's an evil empire and other kingdoms scattered around, it all seems like it should be really entertaining but it just isn't.The direction is awful, it feels like they didn't take their episode numbers into account at all. A third party that intends to ally with the Mud Whale shows up at random in one episode and just hangs out with them for the rest of the series, not affecting anything. Information is doled out whenever the show feels like it and characters are introduced and killed off in bulk. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is where this show excels. The background art is beautiful, the world looks interesting and fun. You want to learn more about the unique society on the mud whale, their specific customs that they've developed from their years in isolation, the world they inhabit. Where it fails is the action direction. Emotionless enemy soldiers wait their turn to attack the helpless and allow themselves to be mowed down for no reason. There is a scene where a weakened old man is able to kill two soldiers by stumbling into them off a cliff, after they'd already cut a gash into his chest. Why they didn't get out of the way is behind comprehension. The show doesn't look bad necessarily in motion but it's nothing impressive. It'll get you some nice screenshots though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI've got a terrible memory when it comes to background music and OP/ED themes. There is, however, a memorable scene in one of the episodes where a character sings a song amidst a battle and it's genuinely beautiful. It briefly revived my hope in this series before it was beaten back into the sand.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1\\n\r\nThe characters are the worst part of this show. \\n\r\nChakuro - the main character who doesn't feel like a main character. He's described as an archivist but this aspect of his personality is so underdeveloped that I genuinely forgot that that was his job until a character referred to him as \"Archivist of Falaina.\" On top of that he's a weak, ineffectual crybaby who, unlike better crybabies like Deku from My Hero Academia, never gets better. \\n\r\nLykos - she literally had the emotions sucked out of her prior to the series and it shows. She's quiet and mopey, refusing to give potentially crucial information until the end of the series despite having it the entire time. \\n\r\nOuni - The only decent character. I think he even exhibits character development, but my god is he not enough to save this section of the review, let alone the entire show. \\n\r\nThe main issue is, as I mentioned before, that they introduce characters at random. \"Oh this character's going on a potentially dangerous mission? Give him a best friend who wants to come with.\" \"Hm... there's not enough internal strife, let's introduce two new characters who literally explain away their absence with a 'we've stuck to the edges of the Mud Whale til now' as if that excuses their delayed introduction and have them stir things up\" They're reluctant to kill off important characters so they invent new characters whenever they want and throw them in the story, hoping to eke out some emotional payoff. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nThere are just enough pretty moments to edge this series above a 1 for enjoyment. It's not fun to watch, it's really boring even during the action. The fact that they introduce new characters just to kill them off destroys any tension once you know who's going to survive. There are about 2 deaths with any real impact, and even then only the first one is felt by the viewer. The penalty for the magic system that the characters have is short lifespans, which is a totally ineffectual penalty. Sure the older characters are likely to die, chances are it won't affect anyone you really care about for another few years, and it's difficult to care about these characters anyway because they just don't do much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nChildren of the Mud Whale is a bad show. It's a pretty show, but it's bad. The art and sound keep it from being a 1 or a 2 but they are not enough to give it an even passable score. This is, after all, an anime, not an art book.",

            "content": "Kujira No Kora is beautiful anime in all senses! I realize not everyone will like, because it\u2019s quite a sensitive story; it\u2019s that kind of story which leaves you, at the end, with lots of tears. The story is quite interesting too \u2013 it\u2019s filled with a magical world and mysteries; so, I\u2019m sure if you start watching it, you\u2019ll end up watching all episodes in a row, considering how much addictive the show is. I need to be sincere with you guys: the show is really interesting, but the story has some inconsistencies; it\u2019s a shoujo show, but, as far as I\u2019m concerned itends up being too shoujo \u2013 to the point where the story becomes unrealistic, at times, because the show follows rigorously the \u201cshoujo criteria\u201d. Everything said, you\u2019ll love the show, so don\u2019t hold back and just watch it right away! It\u2019s on Netflix, after all, come on, guys!\\n\\n\r\n[Story: 7/10]\\n\r\n[SPOILERS ALERT] There are minor spoilers ahead, otherwise it\u2019s really hard to write this review: but don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re not anything which will make a difference when you\u2019ll watch the anime. Also, review big AF ahead.\\n\r\nKujira No Kora has a marvelous universe construction, you\u2019ll be dumbfounded by how well constructed it was. The story is based in a utopic island which moves around a sea of sand \u2013 and, yes, in the story the sea is made of sand: it\u2019s not a figure of language. The island has a small community living within it; to them, that\u2019s their entire world, for they have no idea of the world which exists out there. It seems that utopic island Thomas More wrote about: everything is beautiful, everyone is an equal (well, almost everyone) and all of the people live their lives with no worries and no violence (it\u2019s almost as if they don\u2019t know what violence is).\\n\r\nThat said, there\u2019s something which divides people in two groups: the ability to use a power called \u201cthymia\u201d. Ninety percent of the people can use it \u2013 being known, then, as the Marked; the other ten percent can\u2019t use it \u2013 being known then as the Unmarked. A board of Unmarked elders hold the political reins of the island; however, the work is divided equally among everyone \u2013 even among the Unmarked. So, in this sense, is almost as if that island represented a communist system (if not for the difference in political power among the Marked and Unmarked, but the Marked have super powers; so, I guess that makes them equal lol).\\n\r\nThe people who live in the island are different from the people from their ex-homeland: while they can feel such stronghearted, tear dropping, breathtaking feELiNgS, the people from the outside world don\u2019t have feELiNgS. Now, I can begin to show how incredibly intelligent the show is: I see as a portrayal of our world if it were to become a dystopia (in a way it already is if we stop to think about it). And it\u2019s really interesting how you start the show thinking it\u2019s a utopia but, in the end, you realize it\u2019s a dystopia. In this universe, it came a time in human history when humans deemed emotions could only get in the way, so it\u2019d be better to live without them; therefore, they became heartless soldiers. The people in the island can only live this perfect, utopic life in the island, because they ignore the outside world. And it\u2019s really interesting to see, as the show progresses, that some people in the island, who have emotions, can be really cruel at times \u2013 so, they are just hypocrites pointing their fingers to the outsiders, who don\u2019t have emotions, and calling them \u201cmonsters\u201d. Regarding the outsiders, it\u2019s exposed how far it came the human stupidity to think it\u2019d be better to live in a world without emotions.\\n\r\nSo, the brilliance of the show lies this portrayal of us, of how far the human stupidity can go and of how deluded we can become, unable to see our own hypocrisy. Also, the brilliance lies in the way the show can demonstrate emotions in such a stronghearted, tear dropping, breathtaking way. It just kills me how I ended the show soaking wet with my tears. I\u2019d give a 10 for the story, if not for the inconsistencies; nonetheless, it\u2019s an amazing show.\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 10]\\n\r\nThe direction of art is splendid! The island is so beautifully constructed visually that it only can aid the understanding that is a little perfect world! The art is so well done that it really makes you think that island is a utopia. The art is so good that I\u2019d watch the show just for the art. That\u2019s how good it is.\\n\r\n[Sound: 10]\\n\r\nIt\u2019s rare to watch an anime with an orchestrated soundtrack; just that considered makes the sound of the anime incredible. But besides being orchestrated, the melodies are heavenly, really, they\u2019re heavenly! When you hear that beautiful music, you\u2019ll believe that island is not only a utopia, but it\u2019s heaven. Not to mention the few songs in the show, sung by the own characters, have such a good lyric and carry such a huge emotion that when you start listening, you\u2019ll cry immediately.\\n\\n\r\n[Character: 7)\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve said above, the show can be really, really shoujo \u2013 which, on one side, make it amazing to watch all of those guys with emotions blurting out of their skin acting so passionately around other guys (and girls); but, on the other side, it makes the show unrealistic: Suou and Chakuro, for example, are so kind and passionate that their behavior, at times, is just ridiculous (though, most of the time is just tear dropping). Many characters lack depth while some are really deep and well-constructed; so, if you forgive that and the inconsistencies, I can grant you\u2019ll have a great time filled with tears watching the anime. \\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve said above, this kind of show is not for everyone, but, in my opinion, the best shows are the ones filled with passion, I\u2019m sorry not sorry. \\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 10] and [Overall: 8.8]\\n\r\nI\u2019ve spoken so much about the show in this review that I guess it\u2019s enough (and obvious) to say, with all of its faults, you\u2019ll love the show. It\u2019s like a son or a daughter (I imagine, for God\u2019s sake I don\u2019t want one now): you\u2019ll love anyway, so just watch the show.\\n\r\nI\u2019m sorry for the long review, believe me, I\u2019m tired of reading it as well, so I get you.\\n",

In fact, if there was more world to explore it could be quite enjoyable. Instead, the first two episodes are 25 minute expositions that end up doing nothing for the story overall. \r\nFrom that point on the story attempts to pull heart-strings by delving into the debate of logic vs. emotion, and exploiting the death of children to really drive home the point of how gut-wrenching the story is. \r\nAll in all the story ends up going nowhere while attempting to paint itselfas some kind of amazing piece of art. In short: skip this anime if you can. Its not worth it. \\n\\n\r\nArt; I will say that I did enjoy the background art. I do enjoy a unique look, but its completely thrown off by the same-face animation style that has taken over anime in the last 10 years. Netflix itself has a bad habit of using sub-par animation, and this is no exception. While I can't get past the animation of the characters, I will give credit to the background images. They were well done and really gave the world life. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Abandon the  mud whale. Not worth the time or energy that went into it.",

Not only it has a shallow mediocre material, but tells neutral status rather thantaking some components on every aspects that depicts on a massive downgrade fantasy series. Such as political struggling issues on the deaths between set of characters for having a severe breakdown.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing in this book is decent for the most part. It struggles in the dialogue department at times, coming off as rather clunky in a few areas when it introduces a character and awkwardly explains what they\u2019re about to characters who already know (see Suou\u2019s introduction). Otherwise, I found the dialogue pretty decent enough. It presents us with a redeeming setting wrapped in a coat of luscious, beautiful artwork that is an eyed candy to our eyes, But It lacks a strong cast currently and its pace may be more of a hindrance than a benefit to some horrifying, but fascinating to look at and ponder. Not bogging you down in the detail and bringing them in one at a time. The pacing is quick and while I find that hurts the story, it can be a benefit for those who just want to get straight to the point. Plus, things are easy to follow and never feel that confusing even despite the characteristics, It felt cringe enough to width the amount of parts by being left in a mark.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the verge of the existence in between the stellar art and beauty\\n\r\nintertwine a vision had caught in a blink state of morality. And was also left a complete anticlimatic attempt as it never reach to it's mere type of conclusion. Stereotypes are never felt biased and failed to deepen a crucial focus on what's life is normally like on the Mud Whale. This doesn\u2019t necessarily hurt the series much, Neither pacing didn\u2019t do its justice, by showing characters, or plot any favor. It probably would have been more essential where exploiting a desirous on began challenging the unbearable of living and anticipating the less aesthetic human nature.\\n",

Not a single death except for the first one is even remotely sad or emotional. Even when they have along death sequence to show how much two characters cared for each other, it just doesn't work. If every character was treated like an important character and given time and more than 12 episodes to develop, I might like this considerably more, but they aren't so every death is kind of just like \"Ok so he's dead now, cool I guess?\" because none of the characters that die are properly given any screen time or relevance or dialogue or backstory or anything at all except for the episode of, or maybe the episode before, their death.\\n\r\nAll of this eventually grates on you and is EXCRUCIATINGLY boring. The mechanics of the emotion sucking things that power the ships are completely stupid and have very limited explanation as to what exactly their powers are.\\n\r\nThere is also a song scene later in the show that kind of got on my nerves because the show was acting like this was a massive moment with tons of crazy tension and build up. It was kind of tooting its own horn a little by thinking that this scene was so important and tense that a song sung by some random little girl dancing in the sand ocean would be necessary and feel heavy and important. Of course, the scene runs for too long and is also boring because it is impossible to care about anything that is going on by that point.\\n\\n\r\nPlease for your own sanity don't watch this rushed and painfully boring pretty-looking garbage fire.

It pains me to give such a \"bad\" rating to such a good series. It pains me to read some very harsh reviews on such a little gem... Some complaints feel unjustified... But some others can hardly be overlooked. \r\nI have very very conflicted feelings regarding this series... But if I had to summarize those it would be that you don't have to read the original material to see that the series suffersfrom its length. Kujira no Kora wa Sajou ni Utau should have been made into a 24 episodes anime... There is a MAJOR pacing problem in this series from which derives all of its plot and characters issues.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch this? My answer is definitely a big yes. Had it not been for these issues which I'll detail below, this one would have been this year with Made in Abyss, a new favorite. You know, my personal take is that Children of the Whales had such potential in the first place, that it ended up being rated poorly in comparison to what it could have been instead of what it was. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a good show, honestly... But it could have been a GREAT show. Now, I certainly hope they fulfill their promise of a second season or at least air a movie or something to cover the parts that were heavily neglected in the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall:7\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\\n\r\nChildren of the Whales is based on the manga of the same name. When I first started this series, I didn't know it was derived from a manga. I was so hooked by the first episode that I looked for every single information I could find on Internet and ended buying all 11 volumes published in my country ( published in France under the title \"Les enfants de la baleine\").. which I've yet to read so this review is solely based on the anime version.\\n\\n\r\nChildren of the Whales presents a Utopian world  in which almost everybody seems happy in spite of being confined on some sort of a big floating island in the shape of a whale. After its inhabitants meet a strange girl a series of events enfolds which will change their lives forever.\\n\\n\r\nNow. Children of the Whales can be divided in 2 parts, the first 6 episodes... which pacing is just right... and the second half which execution feels rushed and packs too much information in too little a space in particular in episode 12. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I personally loved the mysteries surrounding the island... it did make the second half of this series particularly confusing. Some major \"problems\" in terms of execution are to mention. For instance, take the fact that the enemies are supposed to be emotionless. While it is entirely true for the foot soldiers, the same can hardly be said about those giving orders. We get a semblance of explanation for it in episode 12... in one or 2 sentences.\\n\r\nI mean seriously, if you are half asleep, and miss the importance of the exchange between two characters for less than a minute, you'll be left with the idea that this series is complete nonsense. I doubt the manga neglects it as it was in the anime. And I'm saying this knowing I didn't even get half of what was said in this particular exchange.\\n\\n\r\nFrankly, I don't like when viewers are taken for idiots... but this anime distills information in such a way as to make them literally cryptic. \\n\r\nAgain, if the pace was just right for the first half, the second half is a complete mess.  \\n\\n\r\nTo avoid spending three hours on all the consequences of the pacing, let's just mention that for strange reason...  they sing. We get 3 songs in this anime sung by the characters...  yeah... Well, better be warned.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nIt is beautiful. B.E.A.U.T.I.F.U.L. Nothing to say here. The background is fixed and comprises of pastel like colors while only the characters are animated and with vivid colors. It's an artistic choice that adds to the idea of the characters being disconnected from reality. The character design is just beautiful... so beautiful in fact that I was confused at first when the main character started to speak. I had taken him for a girl. Once you get used to it though... Gosh, not my style, but this is PRETTY. If you love Ghibli movies, or loved Made in Abyss aired in the same year, you're in for a treat.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\\n\r\nGreat OST, beautiful songs, instrumental or not. High listening value on its own.  Fits the mood to a tee, just marvelous. I'm typing this relistening to it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\\n\r\nOkay... with only 12 episodes... It is to be expected.  That doesn't say much about the manga but it does say something about the anime. We're introduced to so many characters you 'll have a hard time remembering who is who.  I'm used to reading fantasy novels with large cast of characters... But a 1000 pages hardcover allows you to get to know you characters even as you follow 10 or more. \\n\\n\r\nHere though... it's just feels overwhelming. I found myself connecting easily with each of them... but I'm not sure it will work for most viewers. A bit less faithfulness to the manga in order to focus on 4 characters at most to adapt it to its length would have done wonders.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, most characters felt empty. Too many, too short a time although as I said, I found myself connecting easily with them.. But the characters felt flat including the narrator Chakuro. The only characters that really stood out were Ouni, the Captain and nutcase aka Liontari.\\n\r\nThat's not to say that the characters are not lovable or that you can't empathize we them... Really you do ... it's just that they're either too cryptic - Ema for instance - or not given enough screen-time to stand out and the pace of the second half really didn't help.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I would have gone for a 7 had it not been for Liontari who is, as written above, a nutcase. Sure, we get an explanation for why this trash is as mad as he is, but that doesn't make his appearance an agreeable watch. Yes , no adversity no story, no villain no story... but he makes me sick so here, minus 2 because he's just too over the top. This being said, it would be interesting to see if the author decides to make a 180 with him and turn him into a likable character... Unlike some, his madness is the manifestation of him being \"whole\" but broken because surrounded by empty shells. That is something I'm actually pretty curious to see, if the author chooses to do so.\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, the Whales inhabitants have led secluded lives in a peaceful environment which leaves them in a state of shock when the story starts. This lack of reaction while understandable can be frustrating to some. I'm mentioning this only because I've read in some reviews, people calling their reaction stupid. They don't even kill animals on this island. It is not such an easy thing to hurt someone even to defend your own life... and that for everyday people like you or me who are confronted to images of violence on a daily basis.\\n\\n\r\nIt is also the reason why Ouni and The Captain stand out that much. They simply don't fit in.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nOr rather it should be divided as such:\\n\\n\r\nFirst half: 10\\n\r\nSecond Half: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe first half left me wanting more, the world-building, the atmosphere, the characters, everything breathes poetry, travel, magic and infused me with a sense of wonder. Unfortunately the second half of the series veers into the tragic. It is a painful watch with no room for our characters to breathe. Arguably you could say that at least I connected on the emotion front but gosh... couldn't we have a thing or two, to  alleviate the atmosphere a little? No we couldn't because NOT ENOUGH EPISODES. It just felt suffocating and I had to force myself at times because I dreaded what I was going to see.\\n\r\nNutcase spoiled my viewing pleasure A LOT in that second half as well. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 7\\n\\n\r\nWhat a waste. What could have been... Children of the Whales has potential. Real potential. If you like Ghibli movies, great art, poetry , lyricism, and magic , this series is for you. Sure the execution leaves A LOT to be desired and while this anime  definitely is one of the best aired in 2017, it pales next to successful adaptations such as Made in Abyss. Frankly it hurts to think of how great it could have been had the series been twice longer. It ends at the start of a new arc and should be seen as such: an introduction. It is important to mention that you won't get a sense of closure at the end of this journey. The last episode hints at a second season and I sure hope they do and take better care of this little gem. It just pains me to see a manga who from what I've read has received lots of love in Japan from Male and Female readers alike  be treated so poorly. After all, anime originals are a rarity these days, we only get advertisement to buy the manga version... but this advert doesn't work as well as it should have.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some pretty harsh reviews regarding this show on MAL... but my take is, watch it first before making up your mind. If you're not sure, read the manga first then. \\n\\n\r\nSide note: In Japan, the manga is published as a shoujo but in France, in order to touch a larger public, the editor has chosen to publish it as a seinen which is an intelligent move, since graphically I never saw a seinen looking like this, but plotwise it works.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nChildren of the Whales was incredibly close to being dropped from me, it starts off poorly and yet it somehow manages to make me watch it till the very end. This is thanks to a alright yet very familiar story.\r\nStory (6/10)\r\nThe story concentrates on the people of the Mud Whale, an island drifting an ocean of sand. They discover a girl who turns the whole world of the Mud Whale upside down.\r\nThe first two episodes really didn't do much for me and almost made me consider dropping this show, the artstyle, music and the world of the Mud Whale itself had me interested.The characters were the main problem, they were just bland as hell, thankfully the ending of episode 2 kept me on board and I don't regret it too much.\\n\r\nEpisode 3 and beyond changed everything, it's development changed the show from being mediocrely sweet to surprisingly dark. The fact that a new human civilisation had come to destroy the people of the Mud Whale was pretty hectic and seeing characters, who I thought would have a big role, die was also surprising.\\n\r\nHowever once you get past the initial battle and the people on the Mud Whale try to recover and build up for another attack it does slow down again. Then it picks back up again once the next battle arrives, I was entertained for a good while as the battle got more and more brutal for the Mud Whale people, plus there were some pretty cool battle scenes between certain characters.\\n\r\nWhen we reach the final episodes though, the direction of the show shifts immensely as other human factions are introduced and we see the scope of the world itself, which leads us to our cliffhanger end of the series, although with the way things were going this seemed inevitable.\\n\r\nI did like the emotional split between the human factions, as having emotions was a bad thing and not having them was good. I enjoyed this aspect and gave more weight for the opposing sides, however this setup felt way too familiar to Attack on Titan. I mean think about it, a secluded bunch of humans being attacked by a larger faction of humans because they have a specific trait that is wrong to the rest of the world sounds very familiar.\\n\r\nDespite this, I am a little surprised how this anime managed to narrowly escape me dropping it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem of this anime, is the characters, true there is a whole emotional war going on, but when you can't make your characters feel interesting then whats the damn point of them.\\n\r\nChakuro is the male MC, an expressively emotional guy who is very interested about the world he lives in, Chakuro just didn't do much for me as a character. Sure he has an adventurous spirit, but most of the time he actually doesn't do a whole lot. He just points out certain things and obtains certain things, because story plot I guess. By the end of the series I felt barely any different of him than I did at the beginning.\\n\r\nLykos is the female MC, ok I get that she is from a race of people who have discarded emotions, but come on she was another boring character. Although not as bad as Chakuro since you see her slowly develop emotions again over the course of the show, which gave her some development, but she didn't do anything either. She just felt like a character for Chakuro to hold hands with.\\n\r\nOuni felt like the only character, who was actually worth a damn in this show. He already seemed like an emotionless person from the get go, but as he starts fighting against the enemy and starts losing the people he cares about, you really see the devastation erupt from him and he starts to care more for the people of the Mud Whale instead of being an outcast. True his overpowered legacy is a little cliche, but I'm willing to put that aside since he was an actual badass character.\\n\r\nI'll also talk about Suou since he felt like a major character, I thought he was alright since he had the difficult job of being the new mayor of the Mud Whale when the previous one died in the first attack. He tries his best to find peaceful solutions that will keep everyone alive and even when this doesn't happen he still stand up to the enemy so he can protect the others. Suou was a very respectable character compared to others.\\n\r\nThere was a lot of supporting characters, but they don't seem worth the mention since they were only there for a specific role and that was it really, however it did surprise me with certain characters who ended up dying.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI have to give credit where credit is due, because Children of the Whales was a beautifully made show, there was barely any notice of CGI apart from a few cases, but the detail put into the Mud Whale and the scenery was applaudable, it looked fantastic. I also liked the roughness of the characters look too, it gave off a unique feel I haven't seen for a while in an anime.\\n\r\nI think the artstyle is what kept me watching the show mostly, as there were so many scenes you could look at and pick apart how good the animation and background was, like for example the scene where Ouni sees one of his friends die and he sees his spirit sail away or when Chakuro receives a weird object from one of the enemies creature thingies. These are just a few examples, but it proved how good looking the show was.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was also done pretty well too. The OP felt like it was made to fool you into thinking this was a happy show, sure there are moments where you see certain characters arming themselves for action, but you don't know what for and the happy tune the op has along with the scenes being shown helped really well with covering the true nature of the show.\\n\r\nThe ED was also really nice too, it had a calm, but sad feeling to it and this definitely fitted for the later episodes when everything gets brutal with the battles and everything. I also liked how it just showed the ocean of sand like there was an infinite bleakness to it as well.\\n\r\nThe ost also felt magnificently done too, the scenes where it felt calm, sad or something amazing was happening the music just kicked in at the right moment and had some really powerful stuff.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nThe fantasy setting this anime has was pretty interesting, seeing people on an island that is endlessly drifting an ocean of sand until another human civilisation comes and destroys everything they knew, however this is a little ruined when you compare it to Attack on Titan, but I'll give it points for coming up with a fairly unique setting.\\n\r\nThe mystery element in the show, kinda falls short as we get a lot of stuff thrown at us, but not a lot of it is explained. Like for example the weird creatures we see that take human emotion or don't in the case of the Mud Whale, these creatures are a big part of the show, we just don't get a lot of exposition of them which is probably being saved for the sequel.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nI'd say this is a fairly mixed show, but it felt more positive than negative. The characters are really what lets the show down, but it had it's moments of surprise.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show had something, but didn't really do a whole lot with it. We get an interesting world, but sadly it felt strangely familiar to another anime, however I am interested in where the sequel series will go.",

            "content": "I am quite new to reviewing anime series, although I am certainly not new to watching them. I will try to write a brief review that does not divulge anything essential. I was intrigued by the dystopian promise of this series (other reviewers have called the series \"utopian,\" but \"dystopia,\" I think, describes better the world the anime presents). The main problem for me at this point (Season 1 being over) appears to be twofold: 1) the series does not handle well the emotional excess it piles up rather quickly and all too abruptly and, as a result, often blends melodrama with bizarre farce thatseems quite out of place; 2) The changes in plot direction are too sudden, leading to patchy characterization and to some alarming inability to make characters find/fit their environment. At best, it is as if the 12 episodes were used to create a basis for sequels that are supposed to do all of the/most of the work. Having to wait considerable time for a sequel to come, I find this approach unsatisfying. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise of this anime series, by the way, is very familiar, although its setting is somewhat unusual. Without revealing too much, I hope, I will mention that it shares plenty of similarities with a long line of dystopian narratives that have shaped our experience of imagining an altered and troubled Earth, living a life of illusion and false nirvana. From the works of H.G. Wells, Zamyatin, Wyndham, and Orwell through Lanier and Brosnan, there is a strange world out there that carries precarious beauty which comes with an awful price to pay. The creators of \u30af\u30b8\u30e9\u306e\u5b50\u3089\u306f\u7802\u4e0a\u306b\u6b4c\u3046, however, opted to reveal the ugly face of brutal reality way too soon and, in my opinion, sabotaged the promise and the enchanting/mysterious qualities of the early episodes. Rather than building a world where characters can grow and acquire depth, they tried to shatter all and rebuild from there, but in doing so resorted to farce, to haphazard inclusion of newcomers and non-engaging characters, and to some strange pacing that alternated between apathy and frenzy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I am disappointed with this series. Its premise was familiar, but suggested a somewhat unique angle of the \"After Earth\" narrative; its absence of a strong protagonist, its tendency to mix up innocents and psychopaths, gore and prayer, chant and mania, spoiled most of the fun for me. Its visuals are good but not exceptional, and they are also a tad too curious: static, almost sketch-like landscapes clash with the colors/tones used for the inhabitants and their actions.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said all this, I have certainly seen much weaker series, but expected a lot more from this one. Final grade: 5/10.",

            "content": "To all appearances Children of the Whales seemed to be a promising anime. I have the impression that the series held all the necessary elements to be a memorable work: partially interesting and potentially exceptional worldbuilding, splendid artistic direction, intriguing characters... but after 2 episodes, the series goes in another direction and gets worse gradually. In the end, we have a lot of tears, melodrama, inconsistencies, and far too much in my opinion.\r\nStory: Chakuro is 14 years old and is an archivist / scribe on the Mud Whale, an island that floats on a sea of endless sand. That island has several specificities. There aretwo types of people: marked and unmarked. Chakuro is in the first category, that is, he can use saimia, a supernatural ability that unfortunately is responsible for their untimely death. There are other rules like never fighting (very useful to be used as a plot-convenience), not to cry for dead people and especially not to inquire about their existence and their presence on the island. Indeed the Council that governs the people of Mud Whale, doesn't want its people to understand why they live here and why they have supernatural powers.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Chakuro? One day he makes a trip with some friends (including Ohni) to an island they discover nearby (without the authorization of the Council). They meet a mysterious girl named Lykos. They also find a strange structure called the No\u00fbs (which absorbs the emotions of humans)\\n\r\nChakuro brings Lykos on the Mud Whale. The Council strongly opposes and decides to question the girl. However I specify that the girl is a kuudere (yeah ! useful for plot-convenience) so she isn't really willing to talk. We also learn that she can't express her emotions.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, the premise seemed interesting. Many mysteries concerning the origin of the inhabitants of the Mud Whale, on Lykos (which seems to come from another country), and in a general way on the world, where are the other peoples and why the Mud Whale seems so isolated? Episode 3 will therefore answer some questions but I admit that this episode was particularly disastrous. Disastrous for the Mud Whale and for the credibility of the series.\\n\\n\r\n(Light spoilers from there because there is almost impossible to talk about that show without mentioning some scenes)\\n\\n\r\nThis episode 3 begins with the arrival of a gigantic ship called Skylos. The leader (called Oruko) of this ship decides to annihilate all the inhabitants of Mud Whale. Why? No explanation at first, we understand later that the inhabitants of Mud Whale were exiled a hundred years ago. Why exiled? Because they have emotions. And it is here that the series seems hardly credible. If the other inhabitants don't have emotions then why do we see the other pink-haired idiot (Ryodari) be glad killing innocent people? Why is Oruka so happy to kill people? We always see him laughing. So they get emotional !\\n\r\nWell, I won't be a scold. There is an explanation for Ryodari who apparently has strong emotions. Honestly I have the impression that this explanation was later created to erase the inconsistencies and that it was not really anticipated. Also, the introduction of this character was particularly bad and this character is really detestable. I don't care about his situation and I don't sympathize.\\n\r\nHowever, I didn't have explanations for the other characters. The No\u00fbs is supposed to absorb their emotions so why do we see Oruko laughing? Why do we see the other captain being scared when he meets the Daimonias for the first time? They aren't supposed to have emotions so they should just be indifferent.\\n\\n\r\nI can understand that it is difficult to create characters without emotions but in this case, why the author decided to make a difference between the inhabitants of the Mud Whale and the other populations? Finally they are rather similar. When they are in danger, they are afraid. When they are happy, they smile. What is the difference between Oruko and the inhabitants of Mud Whale?\\n\r\nBy the way, a surprising point. When the inhabitants of the island are threatened by the Skylos army, they decide not to defend themselves. The army wants to kill them but they do not react. Why? Because they don't have the right to kill, yeah !\\n\r\nAh ! So the inhabitants of Mud Whale prefer to respect this stupid law than to defend themselves in order to save their friends and their families. Ironically I have the impression that it is rather the inhabitants of the island who lack feelings, compassion.\\n\\n\r\nFrom this episode 3, the series was getting progressively worse. The Skylos decided to leave the inhabitants alive (after killing a lot of people, I confirm) and to abandon Lykos on the island. Lykos was a member of their army, so it made sense that the Skylos wanted Lykos to get back on the boat. However Oruko prefers to leave her on the island to do an experiment. This intention probably has no meaning and doesn't lead to any rational explanation, believe me. Oruko promises to return in a few days to completely annihilate them. (You can write \"lol\" here) The inhabitants decide to avenge their companions despite the opposition of the Council. The Council is really irritating and looks stupid. Honestly, I don't know why they are so keen to hide all the truths about their origin. This obstinacy doesn't really make sense. Furthermore, you will see that some of the members of the Council will even try to sink the boat so that its inhabitants don't fight. Again, why?\\n\\n\r\nWhy don't the inhabitants of the island have permission to fight? Will they receive a curse? Many elements are unfortunately not explained. Especially that these same inhabitants fight later and aren't really subject to a curse. The only thing that could make you doubt is the Daimonias. This is the only potential danger but still, the anime didn't show us that this power was dangerous for the allies.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the inhabitants don't have the right to cry for their dead. Why? No credible explanation. They all cry at the end of episode 3 and even constantly, each character has a tear in their eyes and there is no consequence. I don't see any curse or misfortune because the characters cried. They are unhappy because the Skylos invade their territory and kill their friends, their families.\\n\r\nAh!\\n\r\nThe curse of the whale? I don't see anything except a war, so it's not about the whale.\\n\\n\r\nLet's go through the inconsistencies to talk about the drama. The drama isn't credible. We constantly have scenes that alternate nonsense comedy and drama. And because of this I have difficulties to sympathize with the characters. For example, you see characters like Ginshu making jokes in really inappropriate moments. You see the other character touching the characters' hair as they prepare to fight the Skylos army. There are always some foolish scenes that contrast too much with the dramatic atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the characters, they are numerous. The main cast would be Chakuro, Lykos and Ohni. But the secondary cast is very present. You have a short flashback and you quickly know their feelings. However, as you know that these flashbacks indicate their future death (otherwise they wouldn't show it), suddenly the result seems predictable and uninteresting. And since their screentime is too short, it is difficult to worry about their fate. In a word, it's sloppy.\\n\\n\r\nChakuro is a very effective character for melodrama as he cries a lot and easily shows his emotions. He is very passionate at times! I don't really know what to feel for this character. He never managed to interest me in fact. He is slow, indecisive, timid, really, and his personality doesn't evolve. He seems to like Lykos but their relationship isn't particularly worked insofar as the plot takes up too much space.\\n\\n\r\nLykos is your cute kuudere. She doesn't talk with others but the character is well written. At first, she has no emotions (it makes sense !) and living with the inhabitants of Mud Whale, she will gradually feel emotions. It's a shame that the series isn't more focused on this character. It would have been interesting if we had more access to Lykos' thoughts. However, she is rather irritating thereafter. She knows some things but like the Council, she doesn't want to reveal anything and it's annoying. (Example: why do the marked ones die when they are young? Chakuro and the others don't know it, so why didn't she inform them?)\\n\\n\r\nOhni is probably the best character in the series. He is tired of living on the Mud Whale and wants to discover other places, other countries. And he even fought the first time against the Skylos army while the others didn't dare. So he must have been one of the few characters to use his brain.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, some of the secondary characters were so stupid that I laughed sometimes. For example, Suou, this character is hilarious. He is obviously not credible as a leader since he cries all the time and is unable to make decisions courageously. Besides, I remember a scene where he tries to save Ryodari. I specify that Ryodari is responsible for the death of many inhabitants (and that he doesn't regret), so WHY SUOU WANTS RYODARI TO LIVE ON THE MUD WHALE?\\n\\n\r\n(To mention a scene that made me cringe: Suou appears naked to meet people from another country. That leader... )\\n\\n\r\nOn technical aspects, the series is very satisfying. The artistic direction is truly sublime and original. I personally loved the staging, it was really beautiful. The chara design is not my cup of tea. Male characters often look like trap but the female characters and especially Lykos are very charming. The soundtrack is not really remarkable, there are surprisingly a lot of songs. I didn't find them incredible but pleasant enough. (Neri is really a mysterious character) The opening theme is definitely one of my favorites of the year. Regarding the seiyuus, I didn't particularly like the narrative parts. The narration doesn't bother me even though it's excessive (like Durarara) but Natsuki Hanae has a monotonous and boring voice. \\n\\n\r\nDisappointing. This is the first word that comes to mind. The end is also unsatisfying since the conclusion doesn't answer all the questions. I can't recommend this series but if you want to discover interesting worlds with a coherent worldbuilding and some interesting characters, watch Shinsekai yori or even stuff like the Attack on Titan do the trick.",

            "content": "I'll say this right away, Kujira no Kora wa Sajou ni Utau (AKA Children of the Whales) is not for everyone. It has amazing music and eye-catching visuals, but the story requires the audience to be interested in its themes of emotion and utopianism. The characters and setting have incredibly satisfying arcs throughout the show, but if you're not invested in them you won't find the arcs engaging or nearly as cathartic as I did. \r\nIf the show sinks its hooks in you by episode one like it did for me then chances are you'll have a great experience.\r\n(Long review ahead, TL;DR at the end.)\r\nTheworld of Children of the Whales asks its characters to conceal their emotions for the greater good, a sly criticism of today\u2019s society of people who constantly change their appearances to conform to a standard. The show uses a bit of reverse psychology to immediately establish emotions as the crux of the narrative. \\n\r\nEmotions are the core of this story but powered by a melancholic soundtrack, self-confident directing, and some of the best world building this season, Children of the Whales becomes incredibly immersive. Falling short of the manga by a small amount for cutting out some character backstories, minor side information that adds a bit more detail to the setting, and occasionally awkwardly adapted scenes.\\n\\n\r\n[Story: 8/10]\\n\r\nA vast ocean of sand carries the Mud Whale, a giant magic powered clay ship that is home to many people trying to live out their lives peacefully despite being limited to a small closed off society. Living in a small town myself I connected with the setting immediately. The feeling of being trapped in a contained society that I don\u2019t quite fit in with is shared by a group of characters in this show. \\n\r\nAbout 90% of the population possess telekinetic abilities known as saimia, which leads the afflicted to an early death which earns them the title of \u201cthe marked\u201d. This leaves the 10% of normal people to assume the role of the government, who are also referred to as \u201cunmarked\u201d. The show opens with a somber funeral scene where the main character Chakuro is seen holding back tears with many other fellow Mud Whalers. Everyone on the Mud Whale is taught to suppress their sadness whenever they are reminded by the early deaths they will inevitably face, instead of accepting the fact that they will die soon, they choose to live blissfully ignorant by forgetting about their deceased friends and moving on quickly. \\n\\n\r\nAnyone who has experienced the death of a friend or family member can surely agree that holding in your feelings only makes it worse. Getting sad and acknowledging the loved ones you\u2019ve lost is how you\u2019re able to grow and move on and that pain you feel proves that you loved and were loved. That's the sentiment Chakuro begins to lean towards after realizing the Mud Whale's rules are biased. Right away an uncertainty towards the unmarked ones is planted in the audience's minds when the rules of the Mud Whale are established. The show is able to get into your mind in subtle ways to make you ponder certain subjects so that when they're brought up more as arcs progress you will feel more emotionally impacted. However, if you don't follow these arcs intently then you'll be missing out on a large portion of the experience. Otherwise, the worthwhile pay offs may seem like a desperate attempt to make you sad. This is probably what led so many people to hate the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe conflict of the story comes from the Mud Whale\u2019s interaction with another island and how radically different their beliefs are. The Mud Whaler\u2019s beliefs towards life and emotion are put to the test as they violently clash with their enemies, creating some of the most memorable scenes in the show that stuck with me long after watching. Complex themes woven into the story are not delivered through tiresome exposition. The show gives the audience the pieces of the puzzle without holding the audience's hand and it expects you to figure it out, which makes the experience incredibly rewarding and refreshing. If the idea of working out that puzzle sounds unappealing to you then perhaps Children of the Whales may not be for you, however, I\u2019d still recommend watching the first episode just to see if it sinks its hooks in you like it did to me.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the show\u2019s most intriguing hooks is how central emotions are to the story. The telekinetic powers are controlled by emotion, the Mud Whalers are taught to suppress their emotions. The mystery is so compelling. Just by merely rewatching the first two episodes I picked up on many clues sprinkled into the dialogue (by the talented author) for the sake of people who choose to rewatch. It\u2019s a show that wants you to love it and unravel its mysteries, and it surely isn\u2019t hard to love it once you notice the clues placed with such elegance and care. \\n\\n\r\nEverything in the show has an arc, the characters, the themes, and especially the constantly evolving setting. I loved the way the show reveals information about the world periodically and usually in subtle ways. Whether it be a brief line said quietly by the outsider Lykos or the interesting but vicious psychopaths who invade the Mud Whale. Through meeting new people the islanders broaden their horizons and even the physical island undergoes an evolution. And the way that the Mud Whale actually changes is so satisfying to watch. We see the Mud Whalers live in blissful ignorance in their \"utopian\" society, then eventually the image is cathartically shattered and their whole world is altered irreparably. \\n\\n\r\nI never felt like the show wasted my time. From the first minutes of episode one, it grabbed me with the emotion hook and a society cut-off from the world. Then onward I was getting info on the world that I was already very interested in! If you're not grabbed by the show from the first episode you probably never will be. It's a sad truth that makes the show more niche than it needed to be. I'm hoping enough fans find it to warrant a sequel because the story isn't over yet. \\n\\n\r\nThe one small gripe I had with the story was how the pace is a bit on the quick side. I liked how it never felt like the show was dragging on, but honestly, I wouldn\u2019t have had a problem with more slow scenes to get more of the little details about the Mud Whale I felt were missing from the show. The dialogue is typically quite simplistic, which may bother some viewers. I rarely found annoying given that it allows for the many interesting themes to be visible and easily analyzable. \\n\\n\r\n[Character: 8/10]\\n\r\nThe characters have visible arcs that meld them into the sort of believable people you can root for.\\n\r\nThe mud-whalers start out as bumbling idiots, unable to comprehend the danger they are in. After they experience a devastating tragedy (which I won't reveal) the entire ship undergoes a change. They train and prepare themselves, it was cathartic to see them go from fools who thought they were in control, to wise and determined fighters who understood the struggle they had to endure in order to survive. Watching the three lead characters, Chakuro, Ouni, and Lykos develop is where most of the show\u2019s engagement is derived from. All of them have interesting backstories that are explored in the show. As if they were magnets, the more they experience the more through learning from each other and the tragic events they experience, their characters progress in visible ways. The friends of the main three characters also have individual arcs. This sense of character progression really made the main cast endearing to watch, I was rooting for them all by the end despite a few duds in the roster.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve seen the protagonist Chakuro get criticised for being kind of a wimp. To that I say, he\u2019s meant to be like that. This isn\u2019t some shounen power fantasy. It\u2019s shoujo. The male characters show plenty of emotion and cry just as much as the female ones. Some people might hate this but I found it incredibly refreshing to see this level of sensitivity, it really helped make the show\u2019s theme of emotions believable. I did have a rather large issue with the characters that prevented me from giving them a full score. It\u2019s made clear at the start of the show that there are so many people living in Mud Whale, but as the show goes on it pulls from this unknown amount of random people to use as accessories to the main characters. Instead of killing main cast members these randos are killed nearby the leads, which does add a little bit to the tension. I felt like whenever these characters were added into the lead cast pool I knew they\u2019d be the first to die, just an unnecessary layer of predictability.\\n\\n\r\nThe fantastic world building is extended to the characters due to how well rooted in the world they all are. Citizens of the Mud Whale feel like they belong there. For example; we see that the Mud Whalers don\u2019t get much punishment because there\u2019s almost no crime, which explains why they\u2019re all so carefree and lack a whole lot of respect for the rules and the elders that wrote them. Some of the citizens hate the Mud Whale for how small and closed off it is. Just simply knowing this detail about them makes them all the more believable. I feel similar to the characters who despised their birthplace so even though they don\u2019t get a whole lot of development I was able to connect with them and place myself in their shoes. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the villains, the majority of them are the murderous invaders of the Mud Whale. \\n\r\nWhat the invaders lack in charisma they more than make up for in introspection. Their quiet, logic-based demeanors clash with the emotion-fueled personas of the Mud Whalers. Their motivations make sense from a utilitarian perspective, but put yourself in their shoes long enough and you\u2019ll hate yourself for understanding their beliefs. There were a few standout villains like the visually distinct pink haired Ryodari. He has emotions but due to the society he lives in he has become something of an outcast. His arc becomes visible during the middle half of the show and after that, he becomes a reoccurring character to give the audience an insightful look at life outside of the Mud Whale. \\n\\n\r\n[Art: 8/10]\\n\r\nDespite taking place in a world made of mostly sand and mud, the show is visually breathtaking. The characters look good enough if a bit similar, varying hair colors liven the mostly sand color palette. The hair coupled with vibrantly blue sky gives the world a lot of vibrancy due to the contrast. It occasionally feels like the characters are individual objects to the environments, as they have different visual styles. When a gust of wind sweeps glittering sand across the screen or the mud whalers use saimia they look like they belong in that world, but sadly there are a few moments that didn\u2019t sit right with me. But even during the low points, the show is still stunning and it held my attention constantly. \\n\\n\r\nHaving read the first volume of the manga I can say that the show feels like the manga put in motion as accurately as possible, but sometimes this problematic for the director. Some static scenes in the manga would be transferred into static scenes in the show with a bit of animation of the characters but the background details would be totally unmoving. Making it feel like you\u2019re watching a picture book. Most of these issues are in the earlier episodes when the show is a bit less dynamic, either way, it\u2019s always visually appealing even it takes a little while for the director to find the right way to frame the show.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 9/10]\\n\r\nAn uplifting folky opening starts off each episode with some really thought-provoking lyrics that allude to the evolution the Mud Whale undertakes. I love the orchestral soundtrack to Children of the Whales. It always seems to reflect not only the emotion of a scene but the atmosphere and location of the scene. Great insert songs during titular moments to really hammer home the importance of those scenes. They do a good job of defining a turning point in the story but their mellowness is gentle on the ears.\\n\r\nStrong voice acting, but I\u2019ll be on the lookout for Netflix\u2019s English dub in the near future as they tend to be well cast.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 8.5/10]\\n\r\nMystifying and almost religious atmosphere to the show. The way that the director hangs on certain shots to highlight their importance, cutting out all sound, and giving you time to understand the what makes that shot so titular. \\n\\n\r\nIn the earlier episodes, I was incredibly frustrated at how the Mud Whalers become paralyzed whenever confronted with danger. I understand that in their utopian society they never faced war, but it was painful to watch. It wasn\u2019t helped by the fact that those scenes were dragged on a lot more than they were in the manga. Thankfully this issue is addressed later on in a satisfying way that I\u2019d rather not reveal for the sake of keeping this review spoiler-free. A few annoying pacing issues during the first half of the show that didn\u2019t affect the overall story but hindered some scenes moment-to-moment enjoyment. This is most likely due to the director struggling to find the right length of time to hang on a specific shot. In the second half of the show, I noticed significantly fewer issues and plenty of impressively delivered moments. Sometimes the director hangs on specific shots of characters to convey a sense of weight during turning points of the story.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall I was impressed more than bothered. Some people might not care about those minor issues but those that do will probably have no trouble getting past them once they see the show\u2019s other merits. \\n\\n\r\nScore Breakdown:\\n\r\n[Story: 8] Great world building, high rewatch value, rewarding twists.\\n\r\n[Character: 8] Constantly evolving main characters, large supporting cast.\\n\r\n[Art: 8] Pretty visuals but characters look too independent of the backgrounds.\\n\r\n[Sound: 9] Great music and op/ed, nice insert songs, solid voice work.\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 8.5] Frustrating at times, but gripping in the end.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall: 8.3/10]\\n\r\nThe audiovisual splendor of Children of the Whales grabbed my attention immediately, but as it continued on I saw there was more to it than met the eyes. I'll admit that it's niche as hell and as such many people won't get into it. If the first episode sinks its hooks in you, then chances are you'll find the journey the characters and world undergo to be an incredibly rewarding one.",

Most(if not all) of them are very generic tropes with generic designs, some of they do have interesting traits, but they're left pretty undeveloped, and most of those characters exist for pretty much no reason. Seriously, there's an absurd amount of character's being introduced at a nonstop pace, and we don't  know (or remember) most of their names, which makes it even harder for the somewhat interesting characters to have any development, most of those characters will probably be killed at some point (they already started being killed actually), and that's also a problem, since we know nothing about they and have no reason to care about the main characters because of how superficial they are.\\n\\n\r\nThere are even some small details that apparently are plot holes, since i doubt they'll ever be explained, but i don't want to give spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has a lot of obvious issues, and i don't think i can recommend it to anyone, unless you want to look at some gorgeous artwork, but you'll probably end up being betrayed by it.\\n",

            "content": "Watching shoujo fantasy adventures these days feels like taking a dive into a video game world. When Kujira no Kora Wa Sujou ni Utau (Children of the Whales) began airing, I had a strange instinct about the show. It felt like an anime that really wanted us to really embrace its ideas but fell short on capitalizing on all of them.\r\nCreated by Abi Umeda, few people probably heard of the author\u2019s name. Taking a close look at their resume, some of their work consists of horror genre series. Crafting a shoujo fantasy adventure sounded like a challenge. However, I will say this: the author decidedto mold a variety of themes together that felt different from some of the other shoujo fantasy series I\u2019ve seen in the past. To be clear, I think this show is suited for an audience beyond just the female demographic.\\n\\n\r\nAre you the target audience? Let\u2019s test that theory. Do you enjoy watching a show with colorful world fiction? How about a show with a large cast of characters? Or conflicts involving a utopia certainly thrown into turmoil? If any of these are on your bucket list, then definitely give it a try. That being said, the main attraction on paper is so far the setting. Mud Whale is really a unique dynamic that will draw attention. In an endless sea of sand of the Sand Era, Mud Whale is a moving vessel composed of an unique civilization. There are the \u201cmarked ones\u201d who are individuals with psychokinetic powers but have a short life span. On the other hand, there are the \u201cunmarked ones\u201d, individuals who possesses no powers but have longer life spans. It\u2019s interesting to note that these people live in isolation so they know nothing about the outside world. The plot involves a mysterious girl named Lykos as she changes the lives of everyone on Mud Whale.\\n\\n\r\nAs a 1-cour adaptation running for 12 episodes, I was a bit worried. Before even watching, I had to be less optimistic because it meant the likely event that the show will omit content and also leave questions for the viewers. Unfortunately, that came to be the case after this series ended. It felt like an advertisement of the manga and wants the audience\u2019s hunger for more. As a manga reader, I am thankful that the anime adapted the story consistently with what the overall tone of the setting. But for the overall story, it really felt lacking. My early impression of the show kept me wanting for more though. The first few episodes established the setting and really gives a feel of a shoujo fantasy adventure. We have the characters living their lives in harmony as part of a utopia. Despite being isolated, they behave like humans and have their own system like the council, battle platoons, and recreational services. That changes after Lykos makes her appearance with Mud Whale while bringing attention from outsiders. It transformed the show from a harmonious story into one with dramatic conflicts. This elevates into bloodshed, pain, and even death. \\n\\n\r\nNow as I watched more of this series, I accepted that only the main core characters will get their spotlight. The ones you see on the key visuals includes Chakuro, Lykos, Ouni, Suou, Ginshu, Ryodari, and Sami. Chakuro is the main guy who bears a gentle personality. This is a contrast to characters such as the emotionless Lykos and cold hearted Ouni. While I can\u2019t say Chakuro is an impressive protagonist on paper, he is able to influence others such as Lykos throughout the show. The two forges a unique bond after the two begins to understand each other more. However, the anime doesn\u2019t go too far into developing their relationship nor does it explore them individually as characters. It\u2019s sad to realize this but I think omitting characterization makes the characters harder to accept. For the others, they play a variety of roles such as Suou becoming a leader, Ouni as the rigid combatant, or Ginshu as a guard of Mud Whale. It\u2019s also noticeable that even deceased characters in the series has some influence on the present story. This is especially true when applied to characters like Chakuro as death affects his mentality. Meanwhile, I can\u2019t say the antagonists of the series are appealing. The most noticeable one to point fingers at is Ryodari, the pink haired child soldier. We only see a glimpse of his past but it\u2019s shown that he is clearly unstable and has a thirst to kill for the thrill of it. It lacks any depth in characterization and really doesn\u2019t make him feel believable as a character. Indeed, the characters in the show is a mixed bag. As I watched more and more of this series, it felt like the creator didn\u2019t really put too much thought into making them.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the experience I got from watching this anime felt rather memorable at times. The drama brings a reality to death and there\u2019s a sense of tragedy that can send chills down the spine. While character chemistry isn\u2019t always meaningful, it does have a way to express itself and evoke emotions. The vulnerability of the characters is clear and it shouldn\u2019t take long for viewers to discover how death affects them. While it is also a shoujo, don\u2019t expect romance to actually develop though. It serves more as a genre to carry the style of the story. The mystery elements develops more and more as the story progresses but don\u2019t expect answers to everything. It\u2019s explored through some background storytelling but will still leave viewers to their imaginations.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by J.C. Staff, this anime really stood out in the artwork department. A utopia like Mud Whale is depicted as a perfect society and before the events of Lyko\u2019s encounter, it really does look like one. From the simple character outfits to natural spectacles, it\u2019s a sight to feast eyes on. Mud Whale itself is also decorated with colorful features such as the sand particles, atypical structure, and natural aesthetics. The world fiction gives the impression of what a fantasy shoujo should be with the endless sand. It feels like a vast open world video game. Character designs also makes quite an impression as a majority of the cast are children. It gives off a sense of innocence, vulnerability, and youth. There\u2019s also violence so do expect action to pick up once the conflicts really gets going. The amount of blood isn\u2019t presented as shock value but more as a way to illustrate the reality of death. Fan service isn\u2019t explicit but does also exist with bath scenes so be on the lookout for that.\\n\\n\r\nBeautiful and harmonious. That\u2019s how I\u2019d describe the theme songs of the show and overall tone of the OST. The technical elements of the soundtrack is outstanding to fit with the genres of this anime. Sound director Jin Aketagawa (known for his work on some other fantasy series) impressed me with the overall direction. The synchronization of the soundtrack with some of the more emotional scenes made them feel impactful. Not to mention, there\u2019s also harmonious singing in the show that really took my attention. Character voice mannerism can be a mixed bag at times. Lykos is too emotionless to be memorable while most of the younger characters all sound the same. Ryodari takes his personality often too far to be declared impressive.\\n\\n\r\nAdapting a shoujo fantasy adventure isn\u2019t easy but the final product that came to be felt like it\u2019s missing something. Whether it\u2019s the weak characterization or underdeveloped plot is up for you to decide. It definitely has visual splendor though and sells its setting convincingly to viewers. I just wish they took more time to expand the story and characters to really capitalize on this series as a whole. To me, this is a show that needed more passion to bring audience for appreciation.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The best fantastic adventures take you to cool worlds full of cool characters, and, fortunately for everybody involved, Children of the Whales does just that. Anybody who is a fan of mystery, fantasy, psychological themes, and beautiful artwork should most definitely check this show out!\r\nStory:\r\n A quiet and tranquil ship called the Mud Whale full of short-lived psychokinetics and a handful of boring normies with longer lifespans drifts aimlessly on an endless sea of sand. Barring a few troublemakers the people of the Mud Whale are (mostly) happy in what seems to be a utopian commune of sorts. Unexpected contact with the outside world revealsthat things on the Mud Whale are not as simple and benign as they initially seem, and soon the passengers of the Mud Whale are forced to confront a world that doesn't much resemble the paradise they know. Chakuro (our hero and the archivist of the ship) and his friends must struggle against the pressure of a vast, hostile, and unknown world if they want to continue to live their peaceful lives.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt's beautiful, it's perfect, it looks like Linda Evangelista. This show is gorgeous to look at, and a couple seconds should be enough to convince anybody with working eyes of that fact. It has a muted, watercolor look that keeps the atmosphere very tranquil even when some serious shit starts going down. In fact, the mellow art makes the serious shit all the more serious by comparison. The way this show is drawn and animated would reason enough to watch it even if the story was garbage, and as the story is also great you really have no excuse not to.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe only part of the show that isn't amazing. It's good, don't get me wrong, especially the OP. It's just not as perfect as the art and the story. Nothing to sneeze at, but certainly nothing to write home about. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nReally really good. Chakuro, our main character, is something of a wet blanket at first, but he grows a backbone as the story progresses and he is forced to start standing up for himself and his family. Lykos, a mysterious stranger from abroad, starts off as an emotionally dead husk and fairly quickly becomes a really badass little girl. Kinda like anime Eleven from Stranger Things. Other characters of note include Ouni, the rebellious angsty teenaged shit-stirrer, Sami, the plucky (almost) girlfriend of our protagonist, and Suou, one of the non-psychokenetic individuals on the Mud Whale who is being groomed to become the next chief of the ship. A plethora of side characters, each interesting and dynamic in their own right, help the Mud Whale feel like a lived-in community filled with real people. This, of course, serves to make the fact that they are about to get their shit kicked in all the more tragic.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\r\nThis show is great. It is going to be a fun and colorful adventure full of complex characters, tough decisions, and really beautifully animated fights, scenery, and characters. The world is cool, the characters are vibrant, the visual is spectacular, and the episodes have a natural dramatic tension that is very exciting to watch unfold. Fans of other awesome fantasy/mysteries like From the New World (Shinsekai Yori), Dennou Coil, Uta Kata, and Made in Abyss will really get a kick out of this show. If you have no idea what any of that stuff is, watch this show anyway. You'll love it. And then, if you do, watch that other shit too. Cause you'll like that as well.",

The people that enjoyed it would say it\u2019s a heartbreaking tragedy filled with death and agony, a show packed with emotion. The people that disliked it would call it a tragedy in a more literal sense, and personally I agree with them. With boring and unexplored characters, predictable and badly paced drama, and a dollop of plot armour to top it all off, Children of the Whales manages to mess up almost every part of what could have made it an interesting watch.\r\nOur MC for the show Chakurofeels like a misplaced side character given a slight power boost. He doesn\u2019t do much but survive the whole ordeal and worry about everything, making him completely irrelevant to the story. Our converted enemy Lykos is only around for plot progression, occasionally rising up to be important and then shrinking back into a somewhat empty cast member. The real MC Ouni is the one that holds the most importance and gets explored more than every other character, but for some reason, the show continues to brush him aside so our two less interesting mascots Chakuro and Lykos can take over.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast are only around to create drama, make stupid decisions, and die when needed. I can\u2019t count the amount of faceless blobs of mass that have lost their lives in a desperate attempt to suck out some fragment of despair from its audience. It tries to make us feel attached to people while making no attempt to actually allow us to get to know any of them. There are a few people that the show deems to be of some worth for whatever reason, so it keeps them alive with the wonderful power of plot armour and convenience. Instead of enemies killing them instantly like they do with every other unlucky soul, they take their time to have a little conversation to reveal some plot points, allowing our good guys to make it out alive so they can again be unimportant.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about dying, the drama is a collection of the most predictable situations I have ever seen. You can see almost everything coming from a mile away, and when the show does try to surprise you, the horrid pacing stops you from giving a single shit about each lacklustre episode. Add in the already mentioned plot armour and character stupidity and you are left with massacre after massacre that carry no meaning other than to be a cheap emotional scene for us to sigh over. The only parts that carry any impact are centred around Ouni dealing with his history as a mole rat and him trying to protect his friends. However, the pacing and plot armour still brought it down quite significantly. The story could have made a comeback if it had just played its cards right. To make it even worse, the story ends right when everything is building up for a major arc, just to throw the cherry on the mess that was supposed to be a cake.\\n\\n\r\nNow the two biggest problems I have with this anime are the plot holes and singing. The show states that the Allied Empire, the antagonists of the show, is a country filled with emotionless citizens for reasons explained in the show. Emotionless characters are a tough thing to write so many opt to go with characters that start off emotionless and slowly learn to have human feelings, with even Children of the Whales trying (and failing) this with Lykos. However, the supposedly blank slates that our good guys fight against sure seem to be pretty human to me. Showing signs of fear, desires, and ambition, it\u2019s really frustrating having the show keep telling you that they are emotionless when they are clearly not.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the bloody singing. Why does the show think it\u2019s alright to break out into songs during the middle of a battlefield? Are they trying to make the show seem more deep and dark with a random sad musical playing over some the serious scenes of the anime? I\u2019m trying to find a reason to like this show but it decides to make up for its terrible drama by distracting us with a little singalong. What the legit fuck? It annoys me so much to see something so out of place in an already bad anime.\\n\\n\r\nChildren of the Whales is a show that deserves little praise. It is a massive disappoint that it\u2019s only redeeming point is that it looks nice. No one cares about how good a show looks if the story going alongside it is subpar. Avoid this show, move past it and find something that\u2019s actually worth putting your time into, because this show is just a waste of time.",

            "content": "I love everything about this anime. It is probably one of the most interesting, innovative and well-made shoujos I have ever seen in my life. I was anxious to be able to watch it and now I feel that all my expectations are being fulfilled very well. And I'm still being surprised. \r\nArt (10)\r\nThe first thing I wanted to mention about it, is the beauty of the drawing and the color palette. The colors are mostly very soft, pastel tones, giving a more innocent and pure connotation for the protagonist characters. The antagonists, in turn, always receive stronger colors - I found this quite interesting.In addition, colors also direct well the emotions that viewers must feel: sad themes lead to environments in navy blue, joyful themes ranges from an orange rose to all the colors of the rainbow. It's just beautiful to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe character traits are all super delicate - from the strands of hair to the minutest details of the eyes, the clothes and even the movement of the wind. Even before the series was released, it was this delicacy that made me super excited to be able to follow the anime. I admit: it is my weakness. The way the studio stayed true to Umeda Abi's art style made me very happy too. She is a wonderful mangaka. I really, really loved the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10)\\n\r\nThe second thing I wanted to mention is the wonderful soundtrack. A lot of people don't pay much attention to this kind of detail, but I'm completely in love with the entire OST without even having access to the media yet. It's the kind of OST that I definitely have the interest to get for my collection. And the ending theme! Oh goddess, I love this song. Rionos' voice is simply angelic, this song always gives me goosebumps. The lyrics of the song are very cute and practically whispered, harmonizing a lot with the soft tone that the anime passes, the idea of \u200b\u200bpurity and sadness. \\n\\n\r\nStory (9)\\n\r\nThe story is a bit hazy at first and is being built slowly, like a puzzle. To the present moment, I am giving it a 9 because I still don't know the end of it. I hope it continues to surprise me positively. But it's worth the rate because it's the kind of plot you normally expect from a shounen manga, an adventure full of tragic and even violent twists.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8)\\n\r\nThe characters follow a similar path of history: they are all poorly developed. The story focuses on Chakuro, the narrator, but it explores a bit of several other characters, so it leaves little room for deeper development. The viewer knows the names of the characters, whether they are ordinary humans or controllers of thymia and in some cases, a bit of the past of one or another. But yet their emotions - or their lack - are so well worked out that it also thrills you. Again, I hope to continue to be positively surprised in this regard. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, I may sound a bit partial here because I love their design, but there's no way you can watch this series and not want to hug Chakuro and protect him from all the malice in the world. They are all just adorable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall (9)\\n\r\nI'm having loads of fun and getting lots of excitement too. I love these silly and delicate stories involving human feelings, thematizing individual freedom, the value of life and friendship. This story is a root shoujo (which means it couldn't be more original to the genre, I guess)!\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you like shoujo stories like I do, I'm pretty sure you are going to like this one quite much.",

If you're on the fence on watching, let me personally encourage you.\r\nIn a weird way it feels like a game of Civilization - little countries with hidden motives and philosophies, some are stronger than others in debatable aspects and dreaming of expanding your knowledge of the world to truly understand you're place in it.\r\nThat is all. Watch along this series, it's looking like it's already and gonnaget good.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nWhales are intelligent, majestic creatures. Rulers of the sea by size and by power.\r\nIn comparison, Kujira no Kora wa Sajou ni Utau has no size. It has no power.\r\nAll it really rules over is the bottom of the ocean \u2013 right where it belongs.\r\nSTORY\r\nCredit where credit is due: Kujira no Kora (as it will be shortened to from here on out) contains a neat premise what with its expanse of sand, an inexplicable titan, and the cultural norms it creates. It at least has the footing necessary to get the ball rolling (or, in thiscase, get the \u201cboat\u201d rowing).\\n\\n\r\nBut as a narrative, as a story, this whole venture sinks rather than swims.\\n\\n\r\nMajor issues reveal themselves swiftly and without remorse. For instance, the bad guys have a weird tendency to just not really do anything in situations where they clearly have the upper hand, turning specific events into an excuse to push the plot in a certain direction rather than into intense moments that allow it to develop naturally. Moreover, hardly anything is known about these adversaries since the show will go long stretches without talking about them or at least referring to them, missing out on crucial exploration of their side.\\n\\n\r\nThe trading of information also encounters trouble. Characters like Lykos will hold onto vital clues for very little reason other than to obstruct the narrative. Then, in complete opposite fashion, someone like Aima will descend in front of Chakuro to give him her umpteenth example of deus ex machina so that the plot at least \u201cmakes sense\u201d when going to its next part.\\n\\n\r\nQuotes must be used there since Kujira no Kora often treads into nonsensical territory. Random characters, such as the older elders, appear and disappear out of nowhere. Certain interactions, such as Chakuro speaking with one of the Nous directly, involves incredulous logic. Important changes, such as Ouni\u2019s newfound powers, have miniscule impact in the aftermath of their discovery.\\n\\n\r\nThis systemic plague within the writing festers and oozes its way into the more fundamental aspects of the show. An excessive amount of exposition bogs down the flow, and pacing can get too quick which hinders events. There\u2019s also the intermittent comedic relief. It stilts the tone since people are literally dead or dying and such jokey asides clash hard with the serious morbidity.\\n\\n\r\nEven disregarding the comedy, Kujira no Kora breaks apart with its drama and its action, the areas that make up the bulk of its story.\\n\\n\r\nOn the drama side, it\u2019s tough to care about the loss of life which occurs. It tries to be emotional insofar as those who perish usually represent major figures in the lives of those nearby, but the lacking presence of these people to begin with prevents the drama from landing.\\n\\n\r\nOn the action side, not enough happens to justify the skirmishes. Those who are Marked have essentially magical powers, but their abilities and their usage rarely (if ever) aim for an interesting angle let alone reach memorable status.\\n\\n\r\nProblem after problem hounds this story nearly every step of the way. It\u2019s largely incompetent, and its premise simply cannot carry the glaring mishaps and the ludicrous inadequacies that weigh it down. This vessel doesn\u2019t just sink; it implodes.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show may not recover from the damage to its narrative, Kujira no Kora at least dazzles with the artistry at its disposal.\\n\\n\r\nChief among its wonders is the color palate. The anime opts for a watery fade to achieve its softer hues, coinciding with the sea motif and forming the watercolor looks for many of its visuals. It also chooses much lighter colors in general: pinks, teals, yellows. They add a vibrant contrast not only to the darker blues and purples but also to the overall darkness of the mood at hand.\\n\\n\r\nThe rocky outcropping the characters call home also gets attention. Craggy walls and earthen stone encase their lodgings. Rudimentary holes act as rough windows. Quaint amenities line their rooms. Vegetation on other floating islands and the regal cities of the \u201cnormal\u201d people have a place, but this monolith of mud and clay captures the rustic intent of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCombining the colors and the setting provides the show with ample opportunities to highlight the beauty of this world. Again, it almost never leaves the static ruins of their roaming giant. Yet, when a sunset casts light on their abode or dancing lights flicker in the nighttime air, it becomes easier to forgive the stale variety and to appreciate these gorgeous segments.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the art and the artistry often impress, the more nuanced, technical side of things isn\u2019t as captivating. Cinematography remains standard for many of its scenes, and the actual animation during bouts or as they go about their daily lives stays relatively straightforward.\\n\\n\r\nKujira no Kora prevails with other details, though. The designs for its characters fit the scope and the lore of their era and their culture as loose clothes, accessories, sandals, and other simplistic garb invoke a native feel to their looks. And above them, a painted, almost canvas-esque sky stays aligned with the painted vibe of the art, granting an awe in all directions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the anime contains some rather good artistry. One can\u2019t complain too much here.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThe characters within Kujira no Kora, however, cannot evade complaints.\\n\\n\r\nChakuro takes the helm of this \u201cship\u201d as the lead star and the narrator, speaking of his account aboard their home and his knowledge of the Falaina people (i.e., his people). However, he\u2019s entirely too passive to be considered a worthwhile character within the anime. Not that being passive is inherently a problem; it\u2019s that that\u2019s all he is.\\n\\n\r\nHe\u2019s a writer at heart, so it\u2019s understandable that he stays on the sidelines during fights (even if he\u2019s apparently a very strong thymia user) since he has little in the way of battle training. But he contributes almost nothing else. He watches events play out, and he cries a lot, yet he just laments the situation and goes along with nearly everything that happens around him.\\n\\n\r\nDeaths of dear friends do affect him, so he\u2019s at least attuned with the gravity of their dilemma. That\u2019s not saying a whole lot, however, when he won\u2019t speak up even if he knows the causes behind it. Worse yet, Chakuro will constantly talk about wishing to record the stories of his people for historical purposes episode after episode, but his progress on this front must be minimal because Kujira no Kora rarely showcases him doing as such. I.e., he talks the talk but does not walk the walk.\\n\\n\r\nChakuro is so bland and so useless that it\u2019s a miracle to see him connected to this story whatsoever. Lykos is a walking blob of a character, too. She begins as a blank slate of sorts, harboring almost zero emotion when Chakuro and the others find her. Meaning, the anime primes her for an interesting arc to follow throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nTrue to its trends, though, Lykos succumbs to the same problems of overt passivity and minute contributions. She receives a tiny bit of backstory near her introduction, and she\u2019s related to the main baddy, but the extent of her presence stops there. She barely says or does anything meaningful despite her growing emotions.\\n\\n\r\nLykos maybe-possibly develops feelings for Chakuro, indicating her recent changes on a psychological level. Sadly, their relationship neither goes anywhere meaningful, has a resolute foundation, nor is challenged to any significant extent. That is to say, just as they are individually depleted as characters, the bond they share turns hallow as well.\\n\\n\r\nBesides these two leads, Kujira no Kora includes side characters who likewise fail to meet a proper spot. Shuan, the eyepatch guy, is the outlier amongst everyone insofar as he cares not for anything, including (apparently) his own wife. But he\u2019s almost too much of an outsider, leading his small asides to register as inconsequential moments without much follow-through. Then there\u2019s the purple-hair goofball who gets some pretty vital backstory right before a key scene in his arc. It demonstrates a complete lameness in the character writing, aggravated further by his absurd motivations.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the only two notable characters in the show are Suou and Ouni.\\n\\n\r\nSuou becomes the voice of reason whose nonviolent ideologies struggle against the fear and the hatred which brews in the hearts of his fellow thymia users. He\u2019s the anchor of hope that the rest of the characters look up to, a mature person who himself has a lot left to learn. As a supporting character, he\u2019s at least beneficial to the ensuing plot.\\n\\n\r\nOuni is arguably the most well-written character in Kujira no Kora, but it\u2019s still a weak and precarious backing. The anime sets up him as a conflicted anti-hero who inspires everyone to fight back and who cares deeply for the misfits he has befriended over the years. His never-ending angst and his much-to-be-desired backstory don\u2019t do him any favors, but the personal troubles he endures push him down the right path. A statement that cannot be said for the other two main characters.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Suou and Ouni find themselves drowned out by a mixed bag of other additions to the cast. Sami enlightens the audience to the harshness of their world, Hakuji shows how people can redeem themselves yet, and Masoo reminds everyone of the unfair toll they have burdened. On the opposite side, Oruka is an annoyingly blas\u00e9 villain in need of depth, and the latecomers from the new country arrive way too late indeed.\\n\\n\r\nFor these characters, it\u2019s mostly just a wash.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nA cleansing of the audio is also required for Kujira no Kora.\\n\\n\r\nAt the minimum, its opening track \u201cSono Saki e\u201d harbors a hefty emotional tone that strikes at the bittersweet layer permeated throughout the anime. The tender female vocals and the light acoustic guitar strings work in unison to meld this mood, relying on the drums and the shakers for a steady rhythm. It\u2019s perhaps slightly repetitive in its structure, but poignant delivery for many of its lyrics supplant this grievance.\\n\\n\r\nThe tail end of each episode brings the ending track \u201cHashitairo\u201d, another song aiming for that bittersweet tone. However, it dives into it with more gusto. Female vocals and acoustic guitar strings return alongside piano keys, extra backing vocals, and violins to emphasize the bitter half of the term. Unlike the OP, this ED skirts around repetition, yet the middle section of the track meanders to a questionable degree. Still, the poetic, story-like lyrics introduce a complexity that befits the song\u2019s equally complex emotions.\\n\\n\r\nWhile neither the OP nor the ED stand out as too impressive, they at least do not go down the contemptable route of its semi-insert songs. Over the course of Kujira no Kora, a few musical numbers per se pop up to crescendo as sweeping emotional points in the story. Per usual, though, they fall flat. Sometimes they\u2019re way too out of place, like as the prelude to a battle about to commence. Sometimes they\u2019re too methodical, like as the beginning of the end to the story\u2019s conclusion. Whether melancholic or uplifting in nature, these songs are easily the worst audio decisions in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the rest of the audio elements simply pass the mark. Heavy cellos and quicker instrumentation coincide with the somber and tenser parts of the anime (respectively), but the collection of tracks it touts leave behind nothing all that memorable. The voice-acting performances similarly lose out on any standout mentions. And the sound-effects, regardless of the thymia possibilities, remain par for the course.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the music and the sound fairs slightly better than the other aspects of Kujira no Kora, but it ends up in the red anyway.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nTo say I disliked this anime would be an understatement.\\n\\n\r\nThe weaknesses throughout the season were already enough to make it a soured and sorrowful experience, but the anime goes that extra step further with some more baffling choices. Key among them involves a certain purple-hair antagonistic who shall go unnamed still for being absolutely insufferable.\\n\\n\r\nJim Carrey as the Grinch put it best: \u201cLoathe entirely\u201d describes this annoying, eye-rolling, grating nuisance of a character (intentional or not). Yet the show steps it up again by making him into a literal personal jester later on, increasing his loathsome behavior to another level after what should have been his leave. He pretty much deserved such a fate for being a psychopathic lunatic, but, having hit maximum on the hated scale beforehand, he breaks it afterwards. He has now become one of my least favorite characters I\u2019ve ever had the displeasure of viewing onscreen, and I pray I never have to see him mentioned anywhere ever again.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, I couldn\u2019t take the anime very seriously at all. There\u2019s a distinct part in episode five that is one of the most unintentionally hilarious moments I\u2019ve ever seen in a long time, if not ever. The Nous creature gets hit by an arrow, and its reaction is priceless. The scream, the eyes, the camera zooming in and out. It was a trifecta of funny that wasn\u2019t meant to be so but got there anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAlso why would throwing sand at each other equate to a worthwhile pastime for these stranded people? I get that they must be bored out of their minds out there, but the fact that nobody seems to question such a dangerous activity comes off as irrational.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I\u2019m being nitpicky over such a tiny detail, but it just goes to show how frustrating this whole project ended up being for me. It\u2019s empty. It\u2019s inane to watch. It\u2019s borderline bottom of the barrel.\\n\\n\r\nWhen this one did finally wrap up, it boldly declared that, \u201cThe journey will continue.\u201d I can acknowledge its confidence for future success \u2013 but that\u2019s as far as I\u2019m willing to extend my olive branch.\\n\\n\r\nKujira no Kora wa Sajou ni Utau fails miserably. Like a golden toilet, it shines on the outside thanks to its beautiful art, but, on the inside, it contains excrement in the form of poor narrative writing, odd musical choices, lame characters, and unappealing entertainment. A whale of a time it is not.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Terrible, a ridiculous enemy, improper plot handling, nonsensical happenings, fundamental problems, and an uninteresting direction sink its maiden voyage\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Good, vibrant colors and a painted style give the visuals a gorgeous look even if the more technical traits like cinematography and movement do not impress\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Chakuro and Lykos are horrible protagonists, Suou and Ouni have a mediocre presence, and the remaining supporting and extra cast members lean towards the weak, negative side\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Bad, the OP and the ED demonstrate emotion, but the absurd singing moments and the rest of the lackluster audio elements fail to contribute\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Terrible, has one of the most annoying characters ever seen, laughable when it doesn\u2019t intend to be, and increasingly frustrating the further along it proceeds\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 2/10",

            "content": "On paper, Kujira no Kora wa Sajou ni Utau, or Children Of The Whales, seems promising at first glance, but on screen, as you follow the story of people learning to disregard their emotions (LITERALLY being kuuderes) as a means to survive in a place full of contraptions and controversies amidst the fast-pacing that it has, it becomes over and underwhelming of the overall production value in and itself.\r\nStory & Characters:\r\nIn a world of humans, more specifically the land of Falaina, the sinner's land, people are categorized as Unmarked and Marked according to whether thymia exists within them (which act as their superpowers), with theUnmarked having none of that thymia while being able to live longer and the Marked having thymia but with a shorter lifespan. And the third realm, the rare Daimon (Ouni's power) is able to inflict great power while also being able to live for long.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a journey of the Mud Whale and its archivist, our MC 14 year-old Chakuro exploring the realms of Falaina, learning its actions and discoveries...until the encountering of another country with another MC Lykos, which she is a kuudere since the Nous (heart of the ships) has sucked the emotions out of the people, and has become deaf towards emotions and won't sound out towards the Mud Whale people.\\n\\n\r\nHere's where the problem starts, as the intro towards Lykos meant that the people of Falaina (particularly the main protagonist Ouni and his band of mercenaries) knew that they aren't alone, the Empire Strikes Back (get the pun?) with a slew of side characters from both the Empire (the Skylos ship) and the Mud Whale fighting against each other, like as if the scenes are there for you to get emotionally drifted with whatever the storyline goes, but it doesn't work for me, even as a very emotional person, it doesn't captivate me as much as other shows have had done in their own unique way that really stands out.\\n\\n\r\nEven worse, most notably characters like the annoying no-mercy pink-haired Ryodari just doesn't work out for me, it's like \"Can someone please eliminate this bastard once and for all!?\", and the unrequited lover Sami that has an affection for Chakuro, only to be his sacrifice, IN TURN which is supposed to repress the emotions of Chakuro and us the audience.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall, while the story presentation does have flaws in which the insane amount of characters make up for it, the execution however feels mildly presentable at its finest and becomes a horrible mess towards the end, where I find myself scratching my head always to understand what the hell is going on here towards the ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nOne thing I can give credit to J.C.Staff for is that cel-shading art and glorious animation, because there is really nothing like it out there, and it sticks out with it having one of the best productions that they have done over the years, and really that's no consolation for the entirety of the show overall, because the potentials given and shown here just makes up for the lackluster storytelling, and there in itself, presents another problem to an already existing problem on hand. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nto be honest, I'm not fond of the OST here, and since this show displays a barrage of emotions, the OP and ED are there to introduce you to a realistic feeling of emotions when used well and otherwise. The BGM does a decent job in fulfilling and showcasing the characters at their highs and lows and for the intense and solemn moments of joy and despair. Sadly, the ED is the only good point which I can say it's nice to listen to, even though some will disagree with that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThe make-or-break part is with the ending \"the journey with continue\" (Spoilers alert) on whether J.C.Staff will continue with another season to clearify all the loopholes and misunderstandings that we have with this series as a whole, because so far, this has been a very jam-packed series, with the manga counterpart still ongoing, and it's like ending on a note that's not even far from what we feel is the \"true\" ending.\\n\\n\r\nOn this note however, if you're willing to try this show out, just go in with a mysterious feel, and don't expect much from something that at one point, may have your heartstrings pulled and another, just to wreck that ball of emotions away. Decent, but not entertaining to re-watch this again.",

            "content": "Children of the Mud Whale is a beautiful show with an interesting world that is a complete waste of time. Most of us watched it for the pretty background art and fascinating concept, but it fails miserably to deliver on these.\r\nStory: 3\r\n3 is a bit generous and is there solely because of 1) a death early on that caught me by surprise, and 2) the world building. Mud Whale has an interesting world, with whale/ships powered by grotesque monstrosities on a sand ocean. There's an evil empire and other kingdoms scattered around, it all seems like it should be really entertaining but it just isn't.The direction is awful, it feels like they didn't take their episode numbers into account at all. A third party that intends to ally with the Mud Whale shows up at random in one episode and just hangs out with them for the rest of the series, not affecting anything. Information is doled out whenever the show feels like it and characters are introduced and killed off in bulk. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is where this show excels. The background art is beautiful, the world looks interesting and fun. You want to learn more about the unique society on the mud whale, their specific customs that they've developed from their years in isolation, the world they inhabit. Where it fails is the action direction. Emotionless enemy soldiers wait their turn to attack the helpless and allow themselves to be mowed down for no reason. There is a scene where a weakened old man is able to kill two soldiers by stumbling into them off a cliff, after they'd already cut a gash into his chest. Why they didn't get out of the way is behind comprehension. The show doesn't look bad necessarily in motion but it's nothing impressive. It'll get you some nice screenshots though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nI've got a terrible memory when it comes to background music and OP/ED themes. There is, however, a memorable scene in one of the episodes where a character sings a song amidst a battle and it's genuinely beautiful. It briefly revived my hope in this series before it was beaten back into the sand.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1\\n\r\nThe characters are the worst part of this show. \\n\r\nChakuro - the main character who doesn't feel like a main character. He's described as an archivist but this aspect of his personality is so underdeveloped that I genuinely forgot that that was his job until a character referred to him as \"Archivist of Falaina.\" On top of that he's a weak, ineffectual crybaby who, unlike better crybabies like Deku from My Hero Academia, never gets better. \\n\r\nLykos - she literally had the emotions sucked out of her prior to the series and it shows. She's quiet and mopey, refusing to give potentially crucial information until the end of the series despite having it the entire time. \\n\r\nOuni - The only decent character. I think he even exhibits character development, but my god is he not enough to save this section of the review, let alone the entire show. \\n\r\nThe main issue is, as I mentioned before, that they introduce characters at random. \"Oh this character's going on a potentially dangerous mission? Give him a best friend who wants to come with.\" \"Hm... there's not enough internal strife, let's introduce two new characters who literally explain away their absence with a 'we've stuck to the edges of the Mud Whale til now' as if that excuses their delayed introduction and have them stir things up\" They're reluctant to kill off important characters so they invent new characters whenever they want and throw them in the story, hoping to eke out some emotional payoff. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\r\nThere are just enough pretty moments to edge this series above a 1 for enjoyment. It's not fun to watch, it's really boring even during the action. The fact that they introduce new characters just to kill them off destroys any tension once you know who's going to survive. There are about 2 deaths with any real impact, and even then only the first one is felt by the viewer. The penalty for the magic system that the characters have is short lifespans, which is a totally ineffectual penalty. Sure the older characters are likely to die, chances are it won't affect anyone you really care about for another few years, and it's difficult to care about these characters anyway because they just don't do much. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nChildren of the Mud Whale is a bad show. It's a pretty show, but it's bad. The art and sound keep it from being a 1 or a 2 but they are not enough to give it an even passable score. This is, after all, an anime, not an art book.",

            "content": "Kujira No Kora is beautiful anime in all senses! I realize not everyone will like, because it\u2019s quite a sensitive story; it\u2019s that kind of story which leaves you, at the end, with lots of tears. The story is quite interesting too \u2013 it\u2019s filled with a magical world and mysteries; so, I\u2019m sure if you start watching it, you\u2019ll end up watching all episodes in a row, considering how much addictive the show is. I need to be sincere with you guys: the show is really interesting, but the story has some inconsistencies; it\u2019s a shoujo show, but, as far as I\u2019m concerned itends up being too shoujo \u2013 to the point where the story becomes unrealistic, at times, because the show follows rigorously the \u201cshoujo criteria\u201d. Everything said, you\u2019ll love the show, so don\u2019t hold back and just watch it right away! It\u2019s on Netflix, after all, come on, guys!\\n\\n\r\n[Story: 7/10]\\n\r\n[SPOILERS ALERT] There are minor spoilers ahead, otherwise it\u2019s really hard to write this review: but don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re not anything which will make a difference when you\u2019ll watch the anime. Also, review big AF ahead.\\n\r\nKujira No Kora has a marvelous universe construction, you\u2019ll be dumbfounded by how well constructed it was. The story is based in a utopic island which moves around a sea of sand \u2013 and, yes, in the story the sea is made of sand: it\u2019s not a figure of language. The island has a small community living within it; to them, that\u2019s their entire world, for they have no idea of the world which exists out there. It seems that utopic island Thomas More wrote about: everything is beautiful, everyone is an equal (well, almost everyone) and all of the people live their lives with no worries and no violence (it\u2019s almost as if they don\u2019t know what violence is).\\n\r\nThat said, there\u2019s something which divides people in two groups: the ability to use a power called \u201cthymia\u201d. Ninety percent of the people can use it \u2013 being known, then, as the Marked; the other ten percent can\u2019t use it \u2013 being known then as the Unmarked. A board of Unmarked elders hold the political reins of the island; however, the work is divided equally among everyone \u2013 even among the Unmarked. So, in this sense, is almost as if that island represented a communist system (if not for the difference in political power among the Marked and Unmarked, but the Marked have super powers; so, I guess that makes them equal lol).\\n\r\nThe people who live in the island are different from the people from their ex-homeland: while they can feel such stronghearted, tear dropping, breathtaking feELiNgS, the people from the outside world don\u2019t have feELiNgS. Now, I can begin to show how incredibly intelligent the show is: I see as a portrayal of our world if it were to become a dystopia (in a way it already is if we stop to think about it). And it\u2019s really interesting how you start the show thinking it\u2019s a utopia but, in the end, you realize it\u2019s a dystopia. In this universe, it came a time in human history when humans deemed emotions could only get in the way, so it\u2019d be better to live without them; therefore, they became heartless soldiers. The people in the island can only live this perfect, utopic life in the island, because they ignore the outside world. And it\u2019s really interesting to see, as the show progresses, that some people in the island, who have emotions, can be really cruel at times \u2013 so, they are just hypocrites pointing their fingers to the outsiders, who don\u2019t have emotions, and calling them \u201cmonsters\u201d. Regarding the outsiders, it\u2019s exposed how far it came the human stupidity to think it\u2019d be better to live in a world without emotions.\\n\r\nSo, the brilliance of the show lies this portrayal of us, of how far the human stupidity can go and of how deluded we can become, unable to see our own hypocrisy. Also, the brilliance lies in the way the show can demonstrate emotions in such a stronghearted, tear dropping, breathtaking way. It just kills me how I ended the show soaking wet with my tears. I\u2019d give a 10 for the story, if not for the inconsistencies; nonetheless, it\u2019s an amazing show.\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 10]\\n\r\nThe direction of art is splendid! The island is so beautifully constructed visually that it only can aid the understanding that is a little perfect world! The art is so well done that it really makes you think that island is a utopia. The art is so good that I\u2019d watch the show just for the art. That\u2019s how good it is.\\n\r\n[Sound: 10]\\n\r\nIt\u2019s rare to watch an anime with an orchestrated soundtrack; just that considered makes the sound of the anime incredible. But besides being orchestrated, the melodies are heavenly, really, they\u2019re heavenly! When you hear that beautiful music, you\u2019ll believe that island is not only a utopia, but it\u2019s heaven. Not to mention the few songs in the show, sung by the own characters, have such a good lyric and carry such a huge emotion that when you start listening, you\u2019ll cry immediately.\\n\\n\r\n[Character: 7)\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve said above, the show can be really, really shoujo \u2013 which, on one side, make it amazing to watch all of those guys with emotions blurting out of their skin acting so passionately around other guys (and girls); but, on the other side, it makes the show unrealistic: Suou and Chakuro, for example, are so kind and passionate that their behavior, at times, is just ridiculous (though, most of the time is just tear dropping). Many characters lack depth while some are really deep and well-constructed; so, if you forgive that and the inconsistencies, I can grant you\u2019ll have a great time filled with tears watching the anime. \\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve said above, this kind of show is not for everyone, but, in my opinion, the best shows are the ones filled with passion, I\u2019m sorry not sorry. \\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 10] and [Overall: 8.8]\\n\r\nI\u2019ve spoken so much about the show in this review that I guess it\u2019s enough (and obvious) to say, with all of its faults, you\u2019ll love the show. It\u2019s like a son or a daughter (I imagine, for God\u2019s sake I don\u2019t want one now): you\u2019ll love anyway, so just watch the show.\\n\r\nI\u2019m sorry for the long review, believe me, I\u2019m tired of reading it as well, so I get you.\\n",

In fact, if there was more world to explore it could be quite enjoyable. Instead, the first two episodes are 25 minute expositions that end up doing nothing for the story overall. \r\nFrom that point on the story attempts to pull heart-strings by delving into the debate of logic vs. emotion, and exploiting the death of children to really drive home the point of how gut-wrenching the story is. \r\nAll in all the story ends up going nowhere while attempting to paint itselfas some kind of amazing piece of art.

Not only it has a shallow mediocre material, but tells neutral status rather thantaking some components on every aspects that depicts on a massive downgrade fantasy series. Such as political struggling issues on the deaths between set of characters for having a severe breakdown.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing in this book is decent for the most part. It struggles in the dialogue department at times, coming off as rather clunky in a few areas when it introduces a character and awkwardly explains what they\u2019re about to characters who already know (see Suou\u2019s introduction). Otherwise, I found the dialogue pretty decent enough. It presents us with a redeeming setting wrapped in a coat of luscious, beautiful artwork that is an eyed candy to our eyes, But It lacks a strong cast currently and its pace may be more of a hindrance than a benefit to some horrifying, but fascinating to look at and ponder. Not bogging you down in the detail and bringing them in one at a time. The pacing is quick and while I find that hurts the story, it can be a benefit for those who just want to get straight to the point. Plus, things are easy to follow and never feel that confusing even despite the characteristics, It felt cringe enough to width the amount of parts by being left in a mark.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the verge of the existence in between the stellar art and beauty\\n\r\nintertwine a vision had caught in a blink state of morality. And was also left a complete anticlimatic attempt as it never reach to it's mere type of conclusion. Stereotypes are never felt biased and failed to deepen a crucial focus on what's life is normally like on the Mud Whale. This doesn\u2019t necessarily hurt the series much, Neither pacing didn\u2019t do its justice, by showing characters, or plot any favor. It probably would have been more essential where exploiting a desirous on began challenging the unbearable of living and anticipating the less aesthetic human nature.\\n",

            "content": "This show is a massive disappointment on almost every level, excluding the art.\r\nThis is a show that acts like it has a lot of meaning and good characters and an amazing epic story, but in reality, it is just terrible.\r\nThis show kills pretty much every character except for like a handful, but they try to make most of these deaths seem important and try to to get you to be emotional or feel something for the characters, but it falls so hard on its face. Not a single death except for the first one is even remotely sad or emotional. Even when they have along death sequence to show how much two characters cared for each other, it just doesn't work. If every character was treated like an important character and given time and more than 12 episodes to develop, I might like this considerably more, but they aren't so every death is kind of just like \"Ok so he's dead now, cool I guess?\" because none of the characters that die are properly given any screen time or relevance or dialogue or backstory or anything at all except for the episode of, or maybe the episode before, their death.\\n\r\nAll of this eventually grates on you and is EXCRUCIATINGLY boring. The mechanics of the emotion sucking things that power the ships are completely stupid and have very limited explanation as to what exactly their powers are.\\n\r\nThere is also a song scene later in the show that kind of got on my nerves because the show was acting like this was a massive moment with tons of crazy tension and build up. It was kind of tooting its own horn a little by thinking that this scene was so important and tense that a song sung by some random little girl dancing in the sand ocean would be necessary and feel heavy and important. Of course, the scene runs for too long and is also boring because it is impossible to care about anything that is going on by that point.\\n\\n\r\nPlease for your own sanity don't watch this rushed and painfully boring pretty-looking garbage fire. Thanks for reading.",

            "content": "Personal Rate: 7.5 rounded up to 8 ( because I've got to choose between 7 and 8)\r\nOverall Rate based on the different criteria: 7.4 rounded down to 7\r\nAh Children of the Whales... It pains me to give such a \"bad\" rating to such a good series. It pains me to read some very harsh reviews on such a little gem... Some complaints feel unjustified... But some others can hardly be overlooked. \r\nI have very very conflicted feelings regarding this series... But if I had to summarize those it would be that you don't have to read the original material to see that the series suffersfrom its length. Kujira no Kora wa Sajou ni Utau should have been made into a 24 episodes anime... There is a MAJOR pacing problem in this series from which derives all of its plot and characters issues.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch this? My answer is definitely a big yes. Had it not been for these issues which I'll detail below, this one would have been this year with Made in Abyss, a new favorite. You know, my personal take is that Children of the Whales had such potential in the first place, that it ended up being rated poorly in comparison to what it could have been instead of what it was. \\n\\n\r\nIt is a good show, honestly... But it could have been a GREAT show. Now, I certainly hope they fulfill their promise of a second season or at least air a movie or something to cover the parts that were heavily neglected in the anime.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall:7\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\\n\r\nChildren of the Whales is based on the manga of the same name. When I first started this series, I didn't know it was derived from a manga. I was so hooked by the first episode that I looked for every single information I could find on Internet and ended buying all 11 volumes published in my country ( published in France under the title \"Les enfants de la baleine\").. which I've yet to read so this review is solely based on the anime version.\\n\\n\r\nChildren of the Whales presents a Utopian world  in which almost everybody seems happy in spite of being confined on some sort of a big floating island in the shape of a whale. After its inhabitants meet a strange girl a series of events enfolds which will change their lives forever.\\n\\n\r\nNow. Children of the Whales can be divided in 2 parts, the first 6 episodes... which pacing is just right... and the second half which execution feels rushed and packs too much information in too little a space in particular in episode 12. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I personally loved the mysteries surrounding the island... it did make the second half of this series particularly confusing. Some major \"problems\" in terms of execution are to mention. For instance, take the fact that the enemies are supposed to be emotionless. While it is entirely true for the foot soldiers, the same can hardly be said about those giving orders. We get a semblance of explanation for it in episode 12... in one or 2 sentences.\\n\r\nI mean seriously, if you are half asleep, and miss the importance of the exchange between two characters for less than a minute, you'll be left with the idea that this series is complete nonsense. I doubt the manga neglects it as it was in the anime. And I'm saying this knowing I didn't even get half of what was said in this particular exchange.\\n\\n\r\nFrankly, I don't like when viewers are taken for idiots... but this anime distills information in such a way as to make them literally cryptic. \\n\r\nAgain, if the pace was just right for the first half, the second half is a complete mess.  \\n\\n\r\nTo avoid spending three hours on all the consequences of the pacing, let's just mention that for strange reason...  they sing. We get 3 songs in this anime sung by the characters...  yeah... Well, better be warned.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nIt is beautiful. B.E.A.U.T.I.F.U.L. Nothing to say here. The background is fixed and comprises of pastel like colors while only the characters are animated and with vivid colors. It's an artistic choice that adds to the idea of the characters being disconnected from reality. The character design is just beautiful... so beautiful in fact that I was confused at first when the main character started to speak. I had taken him for a girl. Once you get used to it though... Gosh, not my style, but this is PRETTY. If you love Ghibli movies, or loved Made in Abyss aired in the same year, you're in for a treat.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\\n\r\nGreat OST, beautiful songs, instrumental or not. High listening value on its own.  Fits the mood to a tee, just marvelous. I'm typing this relistening to it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\\n\r\nOkay... with only 12 episodes... It is to be expected.  That doesn't say much about the manga but it does say something about the anime. We're introduced to so many characters you 'll have a hard time remembering who is who.  I'm used to reading fantasy novels with large cast of characters... But a 1000 pages hardcover allows you to get to know you characters even as you follow 10 or more. \\n\\n\r\nHere though... it's just feels overwhelming. I found myself connecting easily with each of them... but I'm not sure it will work for most viewers. A bit less faithfulness to the manga in order to focus on 4 characters at most to adapt it to its length would have done wonders.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, most characters felt empty. Too many, too short a time although as I said, I found myself connecting easily with them.. But the characters felt flat including the narrator Chakuro. The only characters that really stood out were Ouni, the Captain and nutcase aka Liontari.\\n\r\nThat's not to say that the characters are not lovable or that you can't empathize we them... Really you do ... it's just that they're either too cryptic - Ema for instance - or not given enough screen-time to stand out and the pace of the second half really didn't help.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I would have gone for a 7 had it not been for Liontari who is, as written above, a nutcase. Sure, we get an explanation for why this trash is as mad as he is, but that doesn't make his appearance an agreeable watch. Yes , no adversity no story, no villain no story... but he makes me sick so here, minus 2 because he's just too over the top. This being said, it would be interesting to see if the author decides to make a 180 with him and turn him into a likable character... Unlike some, his madness is the manifestation of him being \"whole\" but broken because surrounded by empty shells. That is something I'm actually pretty curious to see, if the author chooses to do so.\\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, the Whales inhabitants have led secluded lives in a peaceful environment which leaves them in a state of shock when the story starts. This lack of reaction while understandable can be frustrating to some. I'm mentioning this only because I've read in some reviews, people calling their reaction stupid. They don't even kill animals on this island. It is not such an easy thing to hurt someone even to defend your own life... and that for everyday people like you or me who are confronted to images of violence on a daily basis.\\n\\n\r\nIt is also the reason why Ouni and The Captain stand out that much. They simply don't fit in.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nOr rather it should be divided as such:\\n\\n\r\nFirst half: 10\\n\r\nSecond Half: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe first half left me wanting more, the world-building, the atmosphere, the characters, everything breathes poetry, travel, magic and infused me with a sense of wonder. Unfortunately the second half of the series veers into the tragic. It is a painful watch with no room for our characters to breathe. Arguably you could say that at least I connected on the emotion front but gosh... couldn't we have a thing or two, to  alleviate the atmosphere a little? No we couldn't because NOT ENOUGH EPISODES. It just felt suffocating and I had to force myself at times because I dreaded what I was going to see.\\n\r\nNutcase spoiled my viewing pleasure A LOT in that second half as well. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 7\\n\\n\r\nWhat a waste. What could have been... Children of the Whales has potential. Real potential. If you like Ghibli movies, great art, poetry , lyricism, and magic , this series is for you. Sure the execution leaves A LOT to be desired and while this anime  definitely is one of the best aired in 2017, it pales next to successful adaptations such as Made in Abyss. Frankly it hurts to think of how great it could have been had the series been twice longer. It ends at the start of a new arc and should be seen as such: an introduction. It is important to mention that you won't get a sense of closure at the end of this journey. The last episode hints at a second season and I sure hope they do and take better care of this little gem. It just pains me to see a manga who from what I've read has received lots of love in Japan from Male and Female readers alike  be treated so poorly. After all, anime originals are a rarity these days, we only get advertisement to buy the manga version... but this advert doesn't work as well as it should have.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some pretty harsh reviews regarding this show on MAL... but my take is, watch it first before making up your mind. If you're not sure, read the manga first then. \\n\\n\r\nSide note: In Japan, the manga is published as a shoujo but in France, in order to touch a larger public, the editor has chosen to publish it as a seinen which is an intelligent move, since graphically I never saw a seinen looking like this, but plotwise it works.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nChildren of the Whales was incredibly close to being dropped from me, it starts off poorly and yet it somehow manages to make me watch it till the very end. This is thanks to a alright yet very familiar story.\r\nStory (6/10)\r\nThe story concentrates on the people of the Mud Whale, an island drifting an ocean of sand. They discover a girl who turns the whole world of the Mud Whale upside down.\r\nThe first two episodes really didn't do much for me and almost made me consider dropping this show, the artstyle, music and the world of the Mud Whale itself had me interested.The characters were the main problem, they were just bland as hell, thankfully the ending of episode 2 kept me on board and I don't regret it too much.\\n\r\nEpisode 3 and beyond changed everything, it's development changed the show from being mediocrely sweet to surprisingly dark. The fact that a new human civilisation had come to destroy the people of the Mud Whale was pretty hectic and seeing characters, who I thought would have a big role, die was also surprising.\\n\r\nHowever once you get past the initial battle and the people on the Mud Whale try to recover and build up for another attack it does slow down again. Then it picks back up again once the next battle arrives, I was entertained for a good while as the battle got more and more brutal for the Mud Whale people, plus there were some pretty cool battle scenes between certain characters.\\n\r\nWhen we reach the final episodes though, the direction of the show shifts immensely as other human factions are introduced and we see the scope of the world itself, which leads us to our cliffhanger end of the series, although with the way things were going this seemed inevitable.\\n\r\nI did like the emotional split between the human factions, as having emotions was a bad thing and not having them was good. I enjoyed this aspect and gave more weight for the opposing sides, however this setup felt way too familiar to Attack on Titan. I mean think about it, a secluded bunch of humans being attacked by a larger faction of humans because they have a specific trait that is wrong to the rest of the world sounds very familiar.\\n\r\nDespite this, I am a little surprised how this anime managed to narrowly escape me dropping it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe main problem of this anime, is the characters, true there is a whole emotional war going on, but when you can't make your characters feel interesting then whats the damn point of them.\\n\r\nChakuro is the male MC, an expressively emotional guy who is very interested about the world he lives in, Chakuro just didn't do much for me as a character. Sure he has an adventurous spirit, but most of the time he actually doesn't do a whole lot. He just points out certain things and obtains certain things, because story plot I guess. By the end of the series I felt barely any different of him than I did at the beginning.\\n\r\nLykos is the female MC, ok I get that she is from a race of people who have discarded emotions, but come on she was another boring character. Although not as bad as Chakuro since you see her slowly develop emotions again over the course of the show, which gave her some development, but she didn't do anything either. She just felt like a character for Chakuro to hold hands with.\\n\r\nOuni felt like the only character, who was actually worth a damn in this show. He already seemed like an emotionless person from the get go, but as he starts fighting against the enemy and starts losing the people he cares about, you really see the devastation erupt from him and he starts to care more for the people of the Mud Whale instead of being an outcast. True his overpowered legacy is a little cliche, but I'm willing to put that aside since he was an actual badass character.\\n\r\nI'll also talk about Suou since he felt like a major character, I thought he was alright since he had the difficult job of being the new mayor of the Mud Whale when the previous one died in the first attack. He tries his best to find peaceful solutions that will keep everyone alive and even when this doesn't happen he still stand up to the enemy so he can protect the others. Suou was a very respectable character compared to others.\\n\r\nThere was a lot of supporting characters, but they don't seem worth the mention since they were only there for a specific role and that was it really, however it did surprise me with certain characters who ended up dying.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nI have to give credit where credit is due, because Children of the Whales was a beautifully made show, there was barely any notice of CGI apart from a few cases, but the detail put into the Mud Whale and the scenery was applaudable, it looked fantastic. I also liked the roughness of the characters look too, it gave off a unique feel I haven't seen for a while in an anime.\\n\r\nI think the artstyle is what kept me watching the show mostly, as there were so many scenes you could look at and pick apart how good the animation and background was, like for example the scene where Ouni sees one of his friends die and he sees his spirit sail away or when Chakuro receives a weird object from one of the enemies creature thingies. These are just a few examples, but it proved how good looking the show was.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was also done pretty well too. The OP felt like it was made to fool you into thinking this was a happy show, sure there are moments where you see certain characters arming themselves for action, but you don't know what for and the happy tune the op has along with the scenes being shown helped really well with covering the true nature of the show.\\n\r\nThe ED was also really nice too, it had a calm, but sad feeling to it and this definitely fitted for the later episodes when everything gets brutal with the battles and everything. I also liked how it just showed the ocean of sand like there was an infinite bleakness to it as well.\\n\r\nThe ost also felt magnificently done too, the scenes where it felt calm, sad or something amazing was happening the music just kicked in at the right moment and had some really powerful stuff.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nThe fantasy setting this anime has was pretty interesting, seeing people on an island that is endlessly drifting an ocean of sand until another human civilisation comes and destroys everything they knew, however this is a little ruined when you compare it to Attack on Titan, but I'll give it points for coming up with a fairly unique setting.\\n\r\nThe mystery element in the show, kinda falls short as we get a lot of stuff thrown at us, but not a lot of it is explained. Like for example the weird creatures we see that take human emotion or don't in the case of the Mud Whale, these creatures are a big part of the show, we just don't get a lot of exposition of them which is probably being saved for the sequel.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nI'd say this is a fairly mixed show, but it felt more positive than negative. The characters are really what lets the show down, but it had it's moments of surprise.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show had something, but didn't really do a whole lot with it. We get an interesting world, but sadly it felt strangely familiar to another anime, however I am interested in where the sequel series will go.",

            "content": "I am quite new to reviewing anime series, although I am certainly not new to watching them. I will try to write a brief review that does not divulge anything essential. I was intrigued by the dystopian promise of this series (other reviewers have called the series \"utopian,\" but \"dystopia,\" I think, describes better the world the anime presents). The main problem for me at this point (Season 1 being over) appears to be twofold: 1) the series does not handle well the emotional excess it piles up rather quickly and all too abruptly and, as a result, often blends melodrama with bizarre farce thatseems quite out of place; 2) The changes in plot direction are too sudden, leading to patchy characterization and to some alarming inability to make characters find/fit their environment. At best, it is as if the 12 episodes were used to create a basis for sequels that are supposed to do all of the/most of the work. Having to wait considerable time for a sequel to come, I find this approach unsatisfying. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise of this anime series, by the way, is very familiar, although its setting is somewhat unusual. Without revealing too much, I hope, I will mention that it shares plenty of similarities with a long line of dystopian narratives that have shaped our experience of imagining an altered and troubled Earth, living a life of illusion and false nirvana. From the works of H.G. Wells, Zamyatin, Wyndham, and Orwell through Lanier and Brosnan, there is a strange world out there that carries precarious beauty which comes with an awful price to pay. The creators of \u30af\u30b8\u30e9\u306e\u5b50\u3089\u306f\u7802\u4e0a\u306b\u6b4c\u3046, however, opted to reveal the ugly face of brutal reality way too soon and, in my opinion, sabotaged the promise and the enchanting/mysterious qualities of the early episodes. Rather than building a world where characters can grow and acquire depth, they tried to shatter all and rebuild from there, but in doing so resorted to farce, to haphazard inclusion of newcomers and non-engaging characters, and to some strange pacing that alternated between apathy and frenzy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I am disappointed with this series. Its premise was familiar, but suggested a somewhat unique angle of the \"After Earth\" narrative; its absence of a strong protagonist, its tendency to mix up innocents and psychopaths, gore and prayer, chant and mania, spoiled most of the fun for me. Its visuals are good but not exceptional, and they are also a tad too curious: static, almost sketch-like landscapes clash with the colors/tones used for the inhabitants and their actions.\\n\\n\r\nHaving said all this, I have certainly seen much weaker series, but expected a lot more from this one. Final grade: 5/10.",

            "content": "Imagine you are walking up a staircase of your memories and on top of those stairs lies the exit to real life. There are many memories that you wish you forgot, there are those that are bittersweet, funny, ridiculous; an amalgam of emotions and thoughts. You are going on a journey of enlightenment with patience and endurance for whatever comes in the way. Suddenly, the staircase ends and you are not even close to the surface. You start pondering whether your quest of reaching the top was fruitful or completely for naught. You consider waiting for the rest of the staircase to appear and keepon the manner with which you started. However, you realize that no matter how much you wait, you will never escape. That is my impression of Children of the Whales in a nutshell.\\n\\n\r\nIt is rare that I find anime that I was genuinely disappointed with. Usually, my disappointment is attributed to anime that seemed from the beginning that they were not planning to go anywhere and even in that case, I was still expecting it. Unfortunately, there are some that have the potential to make a difference and stand out from the norm in their own way, such as shows as Shinsekai Yori which came out at the worst time possible. But, it managed to leave a mark in the industry and surpass the mediocre and its concurrently airing mainstream anime. Unfortunately, this was not to be the case for Children of the Whales, which although started with a lot of promise on its original concept and lore and development on certain characters, ended on the worst point possible in a story.\\n\\n\r\nI was surprised by the implementation of greek in the names of people outside of the island and how much effort was put into building up the lore surrounding the Mud Whale and the rest of the Unknown World. But, the moment Rochalito introduced himself, I stopped taking the use of greek seriously due to how ridiculous it is to give a character the name \"Snore\" and how the mangaka ran out of animals to name people. Otherwise, Children of the Whales was building up to be a war drama and then it changed tangent to an adventure anime with soap opera drama. And that is the first issue with the story: tonal shifts. The show did not know how to handle emotionally heavy moments and blend them well with calmer and comedic ones. It is not as bad as the tonal whiplash was in Akame ga Kill! but it was still really jarring at some moments. Also, that had an effect on the pacing of the show, which started going a lot faster from episode 4 onwards and after episode 9 it became slower than molasses. The ending itself was a representation of what the whole show was: a hot, messy Sloppy Jo sandwich; tasty, but still messy. This is also a qualm I have before watching 12 episode anime series: they are usually too short and towards the end, they get even messier than they started.\\n\\n\r\nFrankly, the lore behind the actual plot of Children of the Whales is innately rich. It explores how people could use Thymia and why it has specific effects, the truth behind the hearts of the lands called \"Nous\". In the anime, all of these concepts are explained and revealed in a rather subtle manner instead of being bombarded to the audience with symbolism and/or in a preachy manner.\\n\r\nBut, even the lore, in the end, is incomplete, because the show is cut short and everything feels just like a small introduction. If the lore had not been so interesting, I may have quitted the show before it ended. Yet, it still feels like wasted potential.\\n\\n\r\nTo make a long diatribe on the characters of the show short, most of them are archetypical or underdeveloped or uninteresting with the worst being Chakuro, the main protagonist of the show. He is your typical Xerox Kaneki protagonist who does nothing useful and he does not change at all as a character. He remains the crybaby he was despite having to go through horrible events at such a tender age of 14 years old. I swear that if Lykos was not a character in the show, the characters would mean nothing to me. Thankfully, she is easily the best character of the show, since she starts as your typical apathetic killing machine and she evolves to a caring and emotional person who is mindful of the people she wants to protect. But, Suou, Ouni and the rest are just not interesting and too underdeveloped for me to sympathize with or remotely care about them.\\n\\n\r\nThe only areas that the show stands out without a lot of stuff to talk about are the art and the soundtrack. The show is breaming with style and the directing is spot on as expected from the director of other anime series, such as Occultic;Nine. The CG sand and thymia fit the show mostly seamlessly but there are a few moments where the characters feel like cardboard placed on top of the screen than actual 2D figures. There were many risks taken with the art style and animation of the show and luckily it mostly paid off. There were a few moments in the show and in the OP where I was impressed with how beautiful it looked. Overall, it is shown how J.C. STAFF with the right directors and animators can pull off high-tier productions better than other studios, such as A1 Pictures.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the soundtrack, only the song found in the preview stood out the most, but it is just a decent track. The OP and ED songs attached to the show are beautiful and easily one of my favorites for the Fall season. They remind me of what the show could have been; emotional, dramatic, suspensful and meaningful as a journey.\\n\\n\r\nIn its entirety, Children of the Whales is just a decent sci-fi that screams potential with its rich lore and good production values, but decides to end as another short adverisement for the manga with more questions than it could handle. I am still glad that I watched it, but the journey made it sure unworhtwile to reach the end which was unsatisfying and aggravating.",

While there is indeed much to be desired, the anime does not pretend to be about either of these things. \r\nIn a word of magic and gifted children who are ruled by elders without similar abilities, Children of the Whales does not pretend to be about childish friendships or silly moments growing up. Instead, they dive right in with a character who is misinformed yet eager for proper answers. And a system set up to ensure he is constantly shielded from them.\r\nThe animeis gripping, not only because the bright colours (might I add here that each character on the Mud Whale is named after Japanese colours) contrast almost sickeningly to the content, or that the theme songs, especially the closing one, is haunting and written to perfectly fit the mood one feels after an episode. The anime tackles how these children respond and are affected when they must decide: allow their home to be taken and destroyed or fight a war. \\n\\n\r\nWith characters representing almost every viewpoint that may fit this topic, Children of the Whales presents a story where children are called on to make sacrifices, are harmed, grow and develop with one another. Quick warning though, don\u2019t get too attached to any character. The anime is not afraid to remind its viewers that war is a nasty game and on the Mud Whale, not even the children are safe.\\n",

This is where I would like to do the show some justice.\r\nThis anime is the tale of the descendants of a group of people who refused to become the mindless puppets of a central authority. Forthis, they were banished from their homeland, and sent into a prison they could not possibly escape. What is more, their rebellion against the central power has been demonized in the historybooks of the mainland, where they are presented as fiendish brutes. \\n\r\n(an oddly familiar way of treating the voice of dissent)\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I think the premise of the show is set quite spendidly. While later on other elements, like the importance of emotions (i feel that the quote from Hamlet is quite pertinent here: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles, And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep No more), become important as well, the story does not neglect its original aim of depicting how a repressive authority works. \\n\\n\r\nInto this grand setting embedded is a magical place with its unique characters and laws of nature. I personally liked the characters, they were just as 'colourful' as you would expect humans to be, with their uncertainties and internal struggles, along episodes of heroism and courage.\\n\\n\r\nI think the show addresses some very interesting topics, which will surely have those thinking who have the desire to do so.\\n",

It's a very emotional story that relies on silence, emotional beats, and what is left unsaid, but it works rather well. Not only that, but the concept of the magic, as well as what it does to the people of the Mud Whale,was incredibly unique and something I enjoyed watching and seeing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I will freely admit that Ouni is one of my favourite characters in the entire thing.

Unfortunately, the life span of the marked is very short, and there wandering ship has left them to be oblivious of much of the world. \r\nThis show was imbedded with mysteries to begin, and slowly but surely we get answers. To keep thisshort and sweet and not spoil anything I will go over a breif Pro vs con list.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- I found the music quite enjoyable\\n\r\n-the artwork was very vibrant and refreshing\\n\r\n-the charecter interactions were entertaining and fairly sensible\\n\r\n-the action scences were fun and well choreographed\\n\\n\r\ncons:\\n\r\n-many behaviors of charecters felt very linear. Rather than like real people, it felt as i the character\\n\r\n was written to be the nice guy, the rebel etc. This made it a bit difficult to truly invest in the vibe\\n\r\n-the story felt very unfinished. Although it was fairly open throughout, I'm not exactly sure I felt there was a centralized climax\\n\r\n-many parts were predictable, or just weren't captivating enough to make it feel important which direction the outcome would occur.\\n\\n\r\nIn all, artistically and musically, this was a beautiful anime, however, progress wise, it fell flat with a somewhat basic plot and lightly flat characters. I felt moments were touching, or a fight scene was heavy, but my overall connection is not as compreble to many other shows with the same intent. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Overall I grant this show a 7. I'd say its a nice watch but don't expect to be immensely wowed. The show is interesting, sure, and has some lovable moments but in all I'd say its a middle of the pack or slighlty above average show by JC Staff.",

Although the pacing is a bit strange it's bearable. 7/10 \r\nArt:\r\nThis anime's art styleis quite fresh, it's a nice change when all you have this season is cookie-cutter animation. I don't really have anything else to say other than they did a really good job with the art. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music is amazing, it pulls you in from episode one. It immerses you even more because it feels like the music actually belongs to the world, like it was created there. 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nNow, the sole reason I stopped watching this disappointing show.\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters are absolute garbage, most of them are introduced just to be killed off (Sami for example) in the first episodes without us even being able to become attached to them. \\n\\n\r\nChakuro is one of worst characters I've ever seen. This feminine crybaby is what killed this show for me. So many times did I have to listen to his whiny little monologues about how \"this is bad!\" and \"i don't like that!\"\\n\r\nNever once has this little piece of human garbage ever stand up for himself, he simply just cries, and cries, and f*%king cries.\\n\r\nWhy isn't Lykos the MC?! She actually does stuff other than sit around and cry! Even Sami would have been a better MC then Chakuro. 2/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you like characters that whine and have others do everything for them, this is the show for you. I really did want to like this show, but the characters hold it back, if you want to watch it for the story then just read the manga instead, Chakuro crying is kinda bearable then. 5/10\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I am in despair. For the first time in a long time I am actually sad that an anime has gone this poorly. I had hopes that Children of Whales (KujiKora for short) could be a little gem of an anime. JC Staff are an animation studio that have probably been the most consistent studio in all of Japan and have given us some incredible classics like Nodame and Hachimitsu as well as some great contemporary works like Sakurasou and Raildex. I had hope that this anime would be able to join their echelons. Fantasy is a genre that I have hardly explored but thisshow had so much promise to introduce to me a whole new, wonderful world with a smooth, slow, purposeful story that took you in with beautiful imagery and charming characters. That was my hope. And it was shattered. \\n\\n\r\nWARNING: DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE ANIME, THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS.\\n\\n\r\nKujiKora is set in a world with a gargantuan ocean of sand. We follow the experiences of people living on a large ship made of mud which is called a \"whale\" which is where our title comes from. The story is told mainly through the eyes of Chakuro - a young archivist living on the ship with several hundred others. Some people - our MC included - possess telekinetic powers called Thymia and are \"Marked\". In exchange for this power they live relatively short lives, rarely going past 30. The ship and its residents have been aimlessly adrift for nearly a hundred years and have never encountered any other people. Whenever another mud ship drifts into view and range, they send people to see whether there is anyone on board as well as to scavenge. There is never anyone on board these rarely encountered foreign ships but, one day, the scavenger group - our MC included - find a girl who turns out to be a soldier for a large empire who sent their own ships to attack and sink their mud ship for reasons that are explained latter into the anime. Thus, begins our thrilling adventure of drama ad suspense while figuring out the secrets of the world.\\n\\n\r\nProblem #1: Too many characters\\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot of characters in this anime. And I mean a lot. There are about thirty or so named characters in the show. It isn't an inherently bad thing that a show has a crap ton of characters in it. Shirobako, for instance, has about twice as many named characters in twice as many episodes and turned out great. Kujikora, however, struggles to juggle between all the characters. A lot of the characters have way too much screen time despite hardly being tertiary characters. It gets so bad that the actual main characters of the show have almost no screen time despite them being the point-of-view characters of the story. The anime does kill of quite a lot of its characters and these are often the characters the anime pushes us to try and form an emotional bond with despite us hardly even knowing them. The anime is simply inept at trying to develop these characters since most of them have one-note personalities and only last around two or three episodes if they're lucky. This makes their existence feel so shallow and I could hardly muster up the energy to feel anything for them. It just feels so cheap. So high is the frequency of the show killing off characters that you just know who has a death flag on them. There's a lot I can list - more so than I want - but one of the most egregious is in the beginning where they kill off the MC's \"love interest\". We hardly know anything about her and her entire character is that she loved the MC. That's it. But the anime constantly brings us back to her and her sad story - especially in the first half - that she got annoying fast. Another egregious example would be Ouni's friend who gets offed simply to become a plot convenience to \"unlock\" Ouni's power as well as to give some cheap backstory which I hardly cared about because he was introduced literally 2 episodes prior. Trust me, these characters might sound like big deals but they really aren\u2019t since so many of them pop up. \\n\\n\r\nThat's another part of the problem: new characters are often introduced seemingly on a whim and they constantly do this throughout the very small number of episodes. A lot of them either end up doing nothing, do very little to further the plot, or and up making the whole thing a lot worse simply by their existence. I understand that this anime is adapted from a manga and that these characters will probably become relevant latter on in the story but in the anime it just feels intrusive. One of the most egregious examples of this happening occurs in episode 8 where two blokes whom we were only introduced to a few episodes prior, and whom were never alluded to \u2013 nor had more than 5 minutes of screen time, suddenly came out looking all important and demanding a rebellion of the Marked against the Unmarked. Not only was this conflict never expanded upon or alluded to in any previous episode (something I\u2019ll expand on latter), but these characters were incredibly one-dimensional. The anime expected me to somehow invest myself in them and the conflict but I just cringed throughout the scene. This haphazard and disregard of characters ruins the pacing of the show. It also makes it so that hardly any of the characters have time to develop past their shallow personalities. This ties in with the second problem I have with the show-\\n\\n\r\nProblem #2: Poor character writing\\n\\n\r\nAs I\u2019ve explained, none of the characters are particularly interesting. This extends from the most insignificant of side characters to the main characters as well as affecting the whole spectrum of bad guys to good guys. The anime\u2019s attempts to make characters be multi-layered and complex end up doing it more harm than good since the show struggles with timekeeping. There are 3 main characters listed on the MAL page for this show but I swear that Suou has the most screentime and he supposedly has a supporting role. The MC is (supposed to be) Chakuro who did have some decent scenes in the first half and had a lot of promise to develop into a stronger, more assertive character after going through all the shit he\u2019s been through. Unfortunately, he hardly changes from his meek attitude he displays at the beginning of the show. This is likely because the creators of the show wanted to contrast him with our other male MC \u2013 Ouni. This guy is supposed to the be sort of edgy anti-villain protagonist with the big power and only helps out the other characters begrudgingly. He unfortunately has very little personality to speak of. His character is reactionary and he never seems to do things on his own violation. Instead, the anime seems to be forcing him to go through with almost all of his actions all for the sake of furthering their shaky plot.  This saddens since he\u2019s the one with the most motivation in the story. He has a bond with a group of friends whom he considers dear to him, he desires to get off the ship and explore the world, and he has huge power which can have a whole arc built around it. Any of those things could have served as the main driving point for his development but the anime flip flaps between them and never gives him any solid ground on which to build his actions upon. To be fair, his group is made up of a bunch of boring, bland characters who, as explained in problem #1, take up far more screen time than necessary. So, like our first main character, he never really develops at all and seems to be there for the sake of being there. Our third main character is Lykos \u2013 the girl who was found on the abandoned ship. She\u2019s kind of alight. She has the second most motivation (and potential) in the show and she doesn\u2019t waste all of it. She serves as the emotionless foil to the emotion-driven people on the mud whale as well as providing a lot of insight in to the world of KujiKora. Her development is the most natural but (I feel like I\u2019m saying \u201cbut\u201d way too many times in this review) the anime writes her in such stupid situations it\u2019s sad. In any other anime she\u2019d be forgettable but here, she\u2019s pretty good. Our last character of note is Suou \u2013 who isn\u2019t but might as well be a main character. He serves as the Chief of the people on the mud ship and is supposed to be the leader type of guy who takes on responsibility and such. He\u2019s a boring character who also never develops but I feel that he should have been the main character from who\u2019s eyes the story is told from. The anime wastes a lot of his potential wither on melodrama or stupid slapstick comedy (problem #3 coming up) and he has very little impact on the story despite being the goddamn Chief of the place. The story always seems to blow straight past him which is a bit of a shame since he has the second most development.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains of KujiKora are hilariously bad. The main one we\u2019ll be seeing is the anime\u2019s attempt at making a crazy character \u2013 Liontari. He\u2019s basically someone who failed the audition to become the main character of Neo Yokio and after seeing he lost to Jaden Smith, he went mad and joined the army just to kill some people. That was a joke but it\u2019s still a better, and more impactful, motivation than he was given in the show. What a shame as well since I think Liontari would fit in perfectly in the comedy genre that is Neo Yokio because I for the love of me can\u2019t take him seriously. He\u2019s the anime\u2019s attempt at making a sympathetic villain and he\u2019s given a lot of backstory and such as to why he\u2019s the crazy guy he is. The anime, however, can\u2019t make him imposing in any sort of way and he instead comes off as a comedic villain while he\u2019s busy doing really despicable things. That sort of mood dissonance is not healthy for the body I\u2019ll tell you that. His \u201cdevelopment\u201d comes late and feels very rushed and contrived. He, like many of the other characters, has a lot of potential in character interactions but he\u2019s never really given any chance to change or anything. The worst part is that he\u2019s got almost as much plot armour as Brie Larson and seemingly can\u2019t be killed off. He sticks around with us like a zit and overstays his welcome up to the very end in the anime\u2019s attempt to bait a second season. I would love to say he\u2019s the only villain of the show since it would beneficially limit the conflict and world of KujiKora to only him and his fellow soldiers and the people on the mud ship. The anime can then be free to make express it\u2019s themes on a much larger scale than the physical setting it is built up on. Uuuuunfortunately (I\u2019m also using that word a lot in this review) this anime tries to make its world on a scale as large as the themes it tries to present. The world building problems will be explained in problem #4 but I\u2019ll explain the crappy side effect that is the overarching main villain of the show. The main villain is introduced early on but only gets proper writing very late into the show. And I mean around episode 10 kind of late. He\u2019s just your generic villain who the anime tries to make imposing but he has so little time to develop. Again, this is likely the anime baiting us a second season, or telling us to screw off and read the manga \u2013 both things which are big problems in their own right. His actual character doesn\u2019t bother me too much \u2013 he\u2019s simply your generic bad guy as I\u2019ve said. What does bother me is that his very presence is detrimental to the show. The introduction of a much grander conflict so late into the show blasts away what was left of the pacing beforehand and he introduces us to the incredibly boring world of politics. The anime should never have adapted his part in and probably should have ended just before his big introduction. \\n\\n\\n\r\nProblem #3: Tone deafness\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has a big problem with its tone. It just can\u2019t keep anything straight. There are many parts in the show where serious exposition is being delivered but then they have many of the (useless) side characters start cracking jokes. They don\u2019t even bother changing the serious music. This is a result of the anime trying way too hard to juggle about a dozen different themes that it clearly couldn\u2019t in just 12 episodes. Many themes are introduced throughout the show including but not limited to: horrors of war, the conscription of children to fight out of desperation, what it means to kill someone, not running away from a cursed fate, how having emotions is better, wanting to explore the outside world and rebel against a closed society (basically Ouni's character in a nutshell), love and grief, the burden of revenge as well as taking on responsibility, the importance of leaving behind records for future generations to find etc. That was long but trust me it feels longer watching the anime try and play out these themes. It feels very disorienting whenever they bring up these serious questions and themes before immediately dropping them in favour of another. It makes everything feel so inconsequential. For example, the people on the mud whale have to conscript little children to fight against the invading force sent to slaughter them. That is one thing but the other is that this is supposed to be a peaceful society who has never seen fighting the entire century they have been adrift AND the explicitly go out of their way to teach people not to use their powers to hurt others. What I expected was a sort of commentary on the desperation of the people and how being forced to use innocent children to fight can be a hopeless situation. But no. These kids are all too happy to shoot arrows and kill the faceless goons. Heck, they even have fun while they\u2019re at it. They don\u2019t address it either. They just SHOW them having fun killing the goons. There are no repercussions for the kids. There are absolutely no consequences for the people who basically forced the kids to kill. None. The worse the adults get is that they feel guilty about it while deliberating on the conscription. The anime just sweeps it away once it is done and offers nothing deeper to think about. \\n\\n\r\nProblem #4: Lack of coherent story telling\\n\\n\r\nAll the various problems with the characters and its themes lead to the storytelling being completely shot. There is almost a total disregard for pacing in the show thanks to the numerous characters being poorly introduced. Things wither crawl at a snail\u2019s pace or they give you whiplash with random new developments. This is especially prevalent near the end when we are suddenly whisked away to the random Empire that is trying to sink our main characters. It suddenly introduces politics in an anime that was never good at politics in the first place. There are way too many plot contrivances in this anime and there\u2019s very little foreshadowing of anything that is to happen. Stuff like the furrball pet suddenly being an important plot point feels ridiculously hammed in because the writers wrote themselves into a corner and couldn\u2019t think of a way to move the plot forward. The stupid friend of Ouni being stupid and wanting to go on the trip felt so inauthentic that I was bashing my head against the desk at the anime\u2019s sheer bravado at trying to move the story forward with such an obvious death flag. It feels like the people writing this show had to refer to a set of guidelines when writing this show instead of actually thinking about the actions and consequences of the story.\\n\\n\r\n#5 Final thoughts (aka tl;dr)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is not good. The themes are messy and are all over the place, the characters are uninteresting, there\u2019s too many characters, the anime tries to gobble up way more than it could, and the story itself is somewhat generic and one I\u2019ve seen in better fantasy settings. This anime reminds me of Shinsekai Yori. Shinsekai Yori, in case you\u2019ve never watched it, is not a particularly well-written show. It struggles with pacing, there\u2019s a lot of characters I didn\u2019t care much about, the themes were messy \u2013 very much like KujiKora. The characters having powers is also a major similarity. So why do I give that a 7/10 and this a 3/10? Shinsekai Yori actually manages to create a world I became invested in. It did this by turning many of its faults into points that drove the anime forward. Lack of pacing? It doesn\u2019t care. Use that infamous exposition episode to naturally build the world. Less-than-stellar character writing? Don\u2019t make characters play very important roles and sideline them which makes the feeling of desperation when shit hits the fan all the more full of dread. Shinsekai Yori managed to create a cohesive world that made sense and feels like it has rules. KujiKora simply feels confused at what its supposed to do and can\u2019t remember any of the groundwork of rules on which it is built upon. It fails at being a compelling, densely-themed story and it fails at building a proper word of fantasy. I have never been so disappointed watching an anime. \\n\\n\r\nKujiKora should serve as a warning to any prospective writers that you should never try to bite off way more than you could chew. Harsh criticisms aside this anime really had a lot of potential. This incoherent mess does have a lot of things that I would like if they did them right. I love a good fantasy show and was hugely expecting this anime \u2013 especially since it came from one of the most consistent studios in the past two decades. This anime, however, is not what they should be doing. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Children of the Whales is a show that starts with amazing potential, and then promptly squanders it.  Watching the first episode or two, I had a lot of good will towards it.  The art is amazing, and reminded me very strongly of Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (an all-time favorite of mine).  The music and voice acting were spot on.  And the ideas were FASCINATING.  I love approaching these high, philosophical ideas in fantasy, and questions of utopia or dystopia, and what makes a human, well, human or what makes life worth living.  And the initial storyand conflict we're given is just that, playing on what it means to have emotions and how life could be different for factions that sacrifice feelings over ones that don't.  It's not fare I'd go for all the time, necessarily, but it can be really good stuff.\\n\\n\r\nAll these existential questions and more were unceremoniously discarded or thrown into the \"never really addressed\" pile in favor of harsh action.  Also and more damningly discarded are basics like pacing and character development, the poor handling of which constantly degraded the show, along with a poor understanding of when and how to do its world building.\\n\\n\r\nAs an example, we lose a very likable character early enough in the show that I wouldn't even count the death in question a spoiler.  I wouldn't mind so much, but towards the end of the show I realized that the one who died in the first couple of episodes was one of the straight-out best characters.  That's right, a character with only a little screen time in the first couple episodes beats out our leads in my mind because that bit character at least had a definitive persona and some recognizable character traits while our central characters just don't.  The survivors, most notably our leads Chakuro and Lykos, were damnably two-dimensional, with no character traits that you could discern if you weren't told by other characters that they're supposed to have those traits.  Chakuro can almost be forgiven -- he is our point of view character, and such a person suffering from being an invisible bland nobody is still bad, but it's hardly remarkable.  Lykos though has to do some heavy plot lifting, and we're supposed to believe that she's experiencing a journey as she gains feelings for, if not literally the first time, the first meaningful time.  How much does she change from the very beginning to episode 12?  Well, her voice acting does emote a little more, and she gets a crying scene?  Yay?  But that happened at the start of her journey too; there's no progress nor transformation, and if she has more or less become a person by the end of the show thanks to gaining feelings of her own, I have no idea who she is as a person.  None whatsoever!  There are more tolerable characters -- Ouni and Suou -- who experience arcs, but for the most part they aren't the focus as much as they should be through the bulk of the show if they're the characters we're supposed to be seeing evolve.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing throughout the story has a continual problem where too much time was spent on scenes that really didn't need it, or building in directions that never paid off.  For instance, there's a minor villain who never really amounts to anything who is given a really notable setup and what looks to be a huge, focal sendoff and it's totally undeserved.  Similarly, multiple times throughout the show we're treated to out-of-time conversations in some spirit world, and while the first one seems to be serving to build character (it fails) and comes at a time where it feels relevant and germane, at least one later such conversation comes in the middle of climactic action, and it takes FOREVER, repeating itself and slowly, over iterations, saying what it wants to say when a much shorter version of the same scene could have been just as effective.  Or, thanks to reducing the bloat, more effective.  These kinds of problems are throughout the show, to the point where you could probably tell the story that it wants to tell in episodes 1-9 in 6 or fewer, which would have left time for the simultaneously rushed and bloated post-script that takes up episodes 10, 11, and 12.  Speaking of which, that little misstep is truly baffling in its failure.  It has the emotional weight and sequence of occurences of something you could handle in a single episode, but introduces so many specific details and new plot threads that it feels like it needs another season to properly explain and explore them.  Maybe that's supposed to be the way it feels, since the show will outright tell you that the journey continues, but there are far more graceful ways to do it.  Other shows, adapted from longer-running source material, leave hooks to draw the audience on to a (theoretical) next season, but they don't do it at the expense of getting the first season right.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound may be great, but the Story is a wasteful mess, the characters are bland puppets, and I was left feeling fundamentally unfulfilled by how insultingly little the show gave me.  Now, I will say this -- I do appreciate the world-building.  I love fantasy worlds that dare to be something alien to Earth as we know it, and the vast Sea of Sand that we see here does that well.  What's more, the creatures and powers (Both supernatural and political) that inhabit the world are quite interesting, and their roles and life-cycles seem designed well.  I didn't like Children of the Whales and can't recommend it, but at the same time I have to say that if a second season does manifest, I'd probably at least try to watch it in the hopes that they go somewhere with that.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nOverall: 5",

            "content": "Story 7/10 :\r\nFor me, the story kept my attention through the entire show and I was pleasantly surprised and intrigued to learn more and more about this mysterious land as the characters did. I liked how it was shrouded in mystery, leaving me confused at some moments as to what exactly was going on before my eyes. I do admit that at some moments it left me a little too confused, hence why I'm rating this show a 7/10 for story, but luckily it wasn't too long for me to lose interest in it's concept. It was a very unique idea that had me hookedon the concept from the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10:\\n\\n\r\nI really loved the art style in this anime. It wasn't the most beautiful I'd seen by any means, but it was definitely an anime that had visuals I really enjoyed. There were some especially beautiful shots in the anime that I will recall and remember fondly and I think that speaks volumes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10:\\n\\n\r\nI can't say that the sound was particularly overwhelming for me, but it wasn't necessarily bad either. The ed track was very nice, I wasn't that interested in the op, and the music in the actual show wasn't too memorable for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10:\\n\\n\r\nI must say that I did like a lot of the characters in this show. Lykos, Ouni, Chakuro, were probably the ones that kept my attention the most. That said, even with characters I did like, I can't say that all of them were memorable. The ones that caught my attention my most are memorable to me of course, but others characters? I can't say the same. I don't think they were necessarily bad characters, but they weren't so special that I would remember them and how they stuck with me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of everything I've said so far, I really did enjoy the anime enough to give it a solid 8. I binged the show from episode 3 to 12 in one sitting if that says anything at all. I wanted to know more about the story as it progressed and I can say without a doubt that knowing more is coming makes me excited for what the future holds with this story. I'm hoping for the best, as well as to learn more about characters (new and old) along the way and what's to come for the characters as they enter the new world.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend this anime to anyone who may have the slightest interest in it. I'm actually quite surprised at the amount of low rating reviews I've seen for this anime so far. I think it's a little harsh to give the rating anything lower than a 7 as an overall rating, simply because it doesn't deserve it. That said, the anime is not for everyone, as is every show. I think it's definitely worth a try, but if it does nothing for you, then that's okay. But give it a chance? I think you may find it'll be worth your while.",

            "content": "First of all, I'm going to start this review by giving a bonus point to this anime for the opening, which is clearly my favorite of the season (although it would have been nice if they changed it a little after episode 3)\r\nStory : 8. I must say, the story had potential. Even though the world was interesting, it is clearly undevelopped but that can be excused by the fact that it only has 12 episode to develop it and that the show seems to be focused on characters and emotions before world-building - but I'll come back on that part in the character section.\r\nArt: 6. Unlike most people here, I really didn't find the art to be that amazing. Sure, it had some great character designs, great color palette and designs too, but that's about it. The art is good for something like an illustration, but in an anime, it's the animation that's more important, and that's what they're missing. Most of it was pretty stiff, and even on parts were it was supposed to be the climax, I feel like they just didn't put enough effort and, as people call it, enough sakuga.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 8. Honestly I'd be lying if I said that I paid big attention to the music in this anime apart from the opening. But I'd say that it's a good point since it didn't disturb me from the actual show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 3. Oh boy, the characters... Where do I start. Well, let's begin with the main character. To me he was one of the only good characters, along with Ouni and, to some extent, Lykos. But still, he was kinda...bland. Now, for other characters of the Mud Whale, while some had great potential (shoutout to best girl Ginshu and best girl #2 Taisha) they get forgotten pretty easily because of the lack of appearance (and yes I had to go back check their name since I forgot them because of how few these two appear in the show). Ouni and Nibi relationship was great, but it was only clearly revealed late in the show so it kinda ruined the climax of their relationship.\\n\r\nAbout the characters from the other islands, I don't even want to talk about them because either 1) they have little to no screentime and 2) those we are able to see are simply incoherent. I mean, yeah, let's make an entire country full of \"\"\"emotionless\"\"\" people and yet they will still have the exact same reaction as the inhabitants of the Mud Whale, pretty logical huh. Although I'll make an exception for Liontari since he is one of the few character of this anime who actually got character development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 3. Boy was I bored when I watched this show. To be honest I only finished watching it to see where it was going in the end,  but I was rather disappointed with an ending leading to a most-likely second season. Well, at least I know that if that second season does actually come out, I probably won't watch it.",

The story tackles difficult themes (e.g. value of life, emotional baggage) but is rushing the first episodes. Plus for the music. Establishment of the (fantasy) setting feels forced on many spots, could have been made a lot better by simply SHOWING what happens instead of narrating every little bit WITH THE CHARACTERS like the viewer is a total idiot and doesn't understand anything by watching. If you are a lazy storyteller, the budget doesn't allow it or sth. and you NEED to explain things, use text or off-voice. Characters who've lived in thesame spot for their whole lives don't go around telling each other how THEIR world works - there are so many ways to show all of that visually. So yeah, I wish they'd have spent one more episode for introduction/establishing. It would have been SO MUCH BETTER! \\n\r\nConclusion: Watch if you like to see beautiful, detailed, painting-esque worlds, if you are okay with heavy themes and graphic violence and storytelling flaws.",

            "content": "The first thing that captured my attention of this brand new anime was the art style. The track for the PV was also enough to get me on the edge of my seat, searching all areas on the internet for a release date. Alas, it was one of those that wasn't as great as I had hoped it would be. That being said, some aspects were just so beautiful to me that I urged myself to write a review. Here are my thoughts-- SPOILER FREE.\r\nSTORY - 5/10\r\nA very unique storyline-- one I cannot compare to any other anime (mind you I can't say I've watchedover 100). However, there were some episodes were I started feeling a little bit bored with the exposition. Things were becoming predictable, and I felt little to no tension built. If you you're looking for action-packed with suspense after every episode, this wouldn't be what your looking for.\\n\\n\r\nART - 9/10.\\n\r\nBreath-taking is the only word to describe it. I've never seen anything like it. I rewatched scenes after nearly every episode because the visuals were so stunning. The colour palette was quite beautiful too. Not much else to say, but I really loved the visuals of this show.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 9/10\\n\r\nBEAUTIFUL soundtrack. The vocals were so elegant, matching the visuals in every scene. I will say that in some scenes I felt that the track was not fitting for the feeling that was to be portrayed in specific scenes. But I'll definitely be listening to this over and over again for a pick-me-up.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 5/10.\\n\r\nDidn't feel as thought many had unique traits about them. The main girl, Lykos, was a very boring character for me and I didn't enjoy her at all. One of the characters I didn't think was so bad was Ouni, who has a rather emotionless demeanour which I'm not a big fan of, either. My favourite character would, unfortunately, be one of the last to be introduced in the final two episodes of the season. I didn't grow any emotional attachment to a character in particular, which is always something I hope to gain from an anime. Bit of a swing-and-a-miss in this category, I must say.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 6/10.\\n\r\nI had a hiatus with this anime after the 7th episode, to which I finished today after 41 days of time going by. I felt like it was becoming an effort to watch, and the only thing keeping me watching was the visuals and the music (I am a very creative person, so music and art are things I thrive on).\\n\\n\r\nTO CONCLUDE: Don't have high hopes for this one. But if you're like me and are fans of pleasing visuals and soundtracks, give it a go and see if you like it.",

            "content": "One of the \"Must Watch Anime of The Year\" in my opinion.\r\n The Development of this anime is pretty slow so don't expect getting exposition thrown at your face every other episode. \r\n The Story is pretty generic if you have watched almost 900 other drama or mystery kind of anime, but it isn't your usual \"1 episode of development, then the next episode the character dies\" kind of anime. \r\n It slowly throws you some hints of the world they live in and what they don't know yet, they could be faster with the development though, but it would ruin the drama andmystery part of the anime, in which in my opinion would be the main reason to watch this.\\n\\n\r\n Characters are generic, nothing new everyone! almost 2 decades of anime and now people are complaining about this common issue, look around you, everyone is generic and there are some people that are more interesting than others, either because they are really smart or maybe they are just energetic and everybody likes them, and this kind of character design in my opinion should be the basis of most anime, you don't need to have an impressive cast of 90 characters with their own background and special abilities or some other different thing (looking at you Naruto+), and this is portrayed very well in the development of this story. \\n\r\n The people of the mud whale have no idea of what is going on in the world and neither does the main characters, the main characters are interesting because they are the ones looking at the major picture of the situation and trying to do something about it (or maybe write about it, in Chakuro's case), the side characters follow the chieftain's orders because they believe in him, and so do the main characters, they grew peacefully and depending on the guidance of the chieftain and the elders, so you shouldn't be asking \"why aren't they questioning the elders, blah blah\", they are but, they spent almost a decade without conflict and reaching to the elders and the chieftain would be common sense if you lived there, do you get my point? Good.\\n\\n\r\n The world FOR NOW is plain, like REAAAAALY plain! Seriously though, it's a giant sand ocean, there's nothing much to talk about it, you can wonder about the beauties of the continents but i haven't read the manga so i can't expect much for now.\\n\\n\r\n The OST is amazing, if you haven't already watched the anime , just listen to the OST when they release it, it's absolutely outstanding, Made in Abyss levels of outstanding. \\n\r\n Sound effects are really well blend with the environment and the Thymia sound effects are well portrayed with it's highlighted sound being easily recognized when someone is activating their thymia (also something noticeable in the anime).\\n\\n\r\n The Art Designs are..... Well i don't know how to describe it very well. It's \"Unique\", some may look at it and call it \"classic\" like designs made almost 4 to 5 years ago, but when you see it in action you can really see why the directors liked the style, with a colorful palette and smooth animation sequences, the art style of this anime makes it a real masterpiece when it is combined with it's amazing OST.\\n\\n\r\n Overall, i think everybody should at least give this anime a try, i'm really enjoying the plot, and like some of the haters of SAO 2, i can become a critic of everything, but in this case, it's kind of hard to see the bad parts of this anime, it's just really well made in general.\\n\r\n I just think it's kind of a shame it has only gained a 12 episode season (but shokugeki no souma san no sara got  24 episodes this year, I SEE YOU J.C STUDIOS), i feel like 12 episodes aren't enough to see the full picture yet and maybe i'll read the manga like i'm doing with made in abyss.",

            "content": "tl:dr: If this gets the subsequent season(s) it deserves, this could easily be the start to a truly phenomenal fantasy series. A strong start to something, but as its own product it definitely falls short.\r\nI was drawn to the show due to its high quality art, interesting sounding setting, and what I thought was a really strong first episode that pulled me immediately. I basically binged it all in one sitting, which is already some pretty high praise. It was not a struggle to get through at all and I enjoyed my time with it.\r\nThis show relies on unreliable narrators, societal taboos, cultural traditions, andthings like that to do its world building. You'll have to pay attention to understand and grasp what's happening. If you don't have the attention span for that, this isn't the show for you. Frankly, I think you'll know early on if it is or isn't - I was hooked right away, and trying to unravel these mysteries about their culture and why things are the way they are and why certain people can act in certain ways we're told to assume they can't is a huge part of why I enjoyed it as much as I did. Judging from other reviews that complain about perceived inconsistencies or lack of explanations, despite the show lacking any inconsistencies or explanations for things that aren't intentionally mysteries, this is not the show for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, my biggest complaint is that I didn't at any point emotionally connect with a show that felt like it was really, really trying to get me to. There's lots of moments where I thought \"oh that's sad,\" but none of them moved me. Part of that is a pretty average soundtrack, outside of its pretty fantastic OP, ED and an insert song we hear a couple times, which simply fails to elicit any real emotional response from me. But the bigger problem probably is with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThey're mainly fine, or a recipe for something interesting, but the show is far more interested in giving us worldbuilding and lore than in connecting us to the characters. I actually think Chakuro is fine, as is Lykos, as is Oruka. They are perfectly fine in their roles and aren't a problem, but none of them are particularly inspiring. I actively like Ouni, Ginshu, Suou, and Neri, but we're not given much of any of them. Otherwise... they're either too wrapped up in the idea of being a mystery, or aren't given enough time or weight to actually feel something when tragedy strikes other characters. It's just, again, \"oh that's sad,\" not even remotely coming close to making me cry and I'm a girl who will cry at anything. Or, they're Ryodari, and are completely insufferable and a huge detracting element from the show. \\n\\n\r\nPart of the problem with Ryodari is the voice acting performance is just too over the top for him. Had he been played in a more sinister, reserved way, endless anger bubbling just below the surface, he could have been actually terrifying and interesting. Instead, he's just this over the top cartoon caricature that is just so bad. Chakuro's voice actor gets a little over the top a couple times too, as do a few other characters at other moments. Oh, and Ham, the cute little animal, sounds too much just like a person making cute animal sounds and that's awfully distracting. Otherwise the voice acting and sound are solid enough, but that's not a small amount of issues.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall plot is really interesting, it has Lovecraftian elements to it and the worldbuilding is frankly fascinating. If you're at all into that, it's worth the small time commitment to check it out, I think. It has pretty fantastic art, though sometimes the background and animated elements don't blend together super well. The magic is super cool looking, gives off some Scrapped Princess vibes in terms of interesting magic effects, and the fights we do see are pretty cool usually. It has most of all the elements here to make a really, really great show.\\n\\n\r\nIn the hands of someone more focused on getting us to know the characters maybe this season alone could even have been fantastic on its own. But instead, it just sets us up for a really exciting adventure to come that, well, might not ever get here. In that case it plays out like so many other shows based on interesting fantasy manga - just an advertisement for the manga. And that's a shame, because this definitely feels like a decent first season to a fantastic series, not the mediocre start that doesn't deserve any further episodes that others seem to make it out to be.\\n\\n\r\nIf I could give it a 7.5, I would. I'd round up to an 8 to help balance out the reviews this show is getting, because I really think it deserves attention, but I'm pretty harsh in my ratings and don't want to make an exception for this.",

            "content": "After finishing this anime, I believe that Children of the Whales can be summarized fully as one thing: a disappointment. I've read a volume or two of the manga beforehand, nothing so much as to spoil the bulk of the story but enough to get me excited about seeing it on Netflix. As much as I wanted to enjoy this anime all the way through, watching this show quickly became tedious.\r\nStory: 3\r\nIn the beginning, this story looked promising. From the get-go, the worldbuilding quickly got my attention and I enjoyed the unique ideas presented. I could see that there was potentially a lot going onin the background that could potentially be the focus for later episodes, particularly the elder council and the surrounding world. However, how it went about this was most assuredly backwards. \\n\\n\r\nTake, for example, and there will be spoilers here, the first episode really going indepth into the elder council. Here we see the reaction to the attack on the island from the elders. Instead of taking a moment to think rationally, coming up with a strategy to repel the invaders or at least escape another attack, the elders decide on the ingenious plan to... wait for it... kill everyone. Brilliant. Then they expect no one to argue and they don't even consult the villagers to ask, hey, would you guys be cool with dying so we can atone for our sins or whatever? And that was the justification they used. Their ancestors from a century ago, apparently criminals, were driven out because they had emotions. So obviously the entire island had to go belly up because of that.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, well, in case you didn't pick up on it, that plan backfired a bit. Or not. Not like the elders should have any repercussions for knowingly deciding to murder the entire island and kidnapping the one person in power who didn't agree with them. But this highlights one very big issue in the series that bothered me the entire way through. The elder council is clearly a flawed system, the elders in question untouchable by law and placed in a position of power merely because they managed to live long enough. It wasn't as if it was hard to live long - all you had to do was be born without the power of thymia. So any moron could become one of the almighty rulers so long as they didn't take a flying leap off into the sand ocean. Not only this, but there's a clear unbalance in power between the marked and the unmarked. So what if the marked have thymia? Thymia was basically just a means to fling things around prior to the attack, but Children of the Whales treats it, at times, as if it were second only to godhood. So not only do the marked live essentially under the thumb of the unmarked, they do all the hard labor. Yet they don't even question it. This, to me, was the hardest part to stomach in the whole series. When someone does try to rise up against the elder council, albeit on some definitely skewed thinking that makes absolutely no sense even for a child, it's immediately quenched. I guess that's because that isn't the focus of the story, even though the series is very clearly trying to take on the politics of this whole ordeal along with everything else. I have an entire world of things I could pick apart here, but this review shouldn't just be about the story and this is a bit of a long wall of text.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art from the manga was, I'm sure, what drew a lot of readers to the title. It was also probably the entire reason the anime was worth salvaging. Though the art doesn't hold a candle to the manga, it carried over surprisingly well. The backgrounds were detailed and atmospheric. The anime looked good, all around. My main complaints come in with the character designs, which were hardly unique. While they were different enough to tell apart, the faces pretty much looked the same and the style of the characters could be jarring against the backgrounds, especially when CGI was used.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe music composition suited the tone and atmosphere while not being particularly outstanding. Voice acting was decent, I'd say, though I'm not one to take note of that too much. Liontari's voice got on my nerves more than it should, and constantly distracted from the story, but maybe that was just the character itself. Nothing to write home about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\\n\r\nThese are the worst aspect of the story, never setting up too many expectations and yet dashing them all the same. The main character is a bland protagonist whose only two qualities are that he can't do anything and he likes living. Yippee. Oh, and he writes things obsessively, a character trait that started out as a plot device, stayed a plot device, and was dropped occasionly as the plot served. Most of the other characters, and there are many, fall into stereotypes or their only personality trait is that they have no personality. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of no personality, there's also Neri and her twin sister who have absolutely no explanation for existing as of yet, have these weird god powers, speak to the dead, and deliver exposition whenever the mood strikes them. They are also prone to breaking into and encouraging others to sing and dance, usually about death and during the middle of a climactic moment. The only other character who exhibits this behaviour is Liontari, someone who gets off on killing emotional people and is later forced to perform in a jester suit for the sake of his boss Orca's weird fetish for the things. Huh.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\\n\r\nThe height of my enjoyment was during the first two episodes, when I still had the innocence of expecting an unfinished manga to be adapted well. It steadily decreased from there as the series just got worse and worse. By the time I was at the final episode, I was practically ready to just drop the series for the time being only to spontaneously pick it up again a year or two later. There's a part of me that still wishes I had done that.\\n\\n\r\nMan, this review ended up being long.\\n",

            "content": "It's good to see a show like this every once in a while to really make you appreciate what makes a good anime, or even just a good story in general by reminding you what happens when essential elements are not there. \r\nArt 10/10\r\nThe show is very impressive in an aesthetic sense. The visual style is without a doubt the greatest strength that the show possesses, and probably what influenced most of the viewers to watch it in the first place. \r\nSound 7/10\r\nThe soundtrack is definitely good, but not something that really stands out as remarkable when I think about the show. I do notthink back on any of the music in the show and think to myself, \"Wow, that was truly remarkable, I'd like to listen to that again.\"\\n\\n\r\nStory 2/10\\n\r\nThe story had some potential to begin with because of the interesting setting, but suffers tremendously by trying to cram way too much into a short time. Because of this, it relies on more cliches than I can count. The plot just seems predictable most of the time, and completely jumbled the next. The most egregious offender of predictability lies with the character deaths. You can predict with painful accuracy who will die and when because the story just regurgitates popular tropes. Some previously unintroduced character shows some kind of unique personality quirk? Yup, looks like he's dying in the next episode. Another character has a flashback scene that is trying to establish that he means something to the main characters? Yup, looks like he's going to die too. At one point, they bestow magical McGuffin powers onto a character in the most cliche way possible. The possibility of this character having McGuffin powers is mentioned by an antagonist, so the antagonist (who actually believes in the existence of these McGuffin powers) decides to just continually hit this character with non-fatal blows for no reason other than to give the McGuffin powers the chance to manifest. The thought process for this character must have played out as \"Oh no, this guy may be the magical McGuffin that can ruin all of our plans! Better whack him a few more times before ending him hurr durr.\" Scenes like this were physically painful to watch. It's as if an alien watched a few episodes of anime and then tried to regurgitate the tropes he had seen onto a very pretty canvas. The actions are there to move the story along, but they do not seem like choices made by actual people. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 1/10\\n\r\nThe characters were by far the worst aspect of this show. Without going into very much detail, you have your 5 flavors of stereotypical mediocrity. You have your protagonist who is sensitive and unnaturally gifted with magic but unsure and doubtful of himself, your silent mysterious badass with a heart of gold, your sensitive ultra-pacifist, your sadist antagonist (why? BECAUSE REASONS), and your unique looking female who has no emotions (see Rei-clone).  Their motivations for doing virtually anything that they do make very little sense, and it feels like there is barely any semblance of a character arc for any of them. Their actions just don't seem to be the actions of actual human beings with actual motivations, and for that reason, I just could not develop any feelings of attachment to any of them. *Finished after this point, and the character problems do in fact get worse*\\n\\n\r\nI think the best way to summarize the shortcomings of this show is that it tries to accomplish and incorporate a lot of elements without earning the right to do so. It doesn't invest enough time into its characters to make you care about them, so it does not earn the right to make you feel for their deaths or struggles. It doesn't construct an interesting plot, so it does not elicit surprise or awe at any of the twists it tries to incorporate. It tries to speak about deep themes with grand, sweeping statements about life, the world, etc, but it just hasn't created a well-crafted story by which to illustrate its points. \\n\\n\r\ntl;dr the show is absolutely beautiful, but there is no substance beneath the aesthetically appealing veneer. It's plot and characters just seem hollow.",

However, sound (7/10, especially opening and ending songs) and art (8/10) are really good.\r\nLike most things at first sometimes they seem a bit dull so I thought I'd give it a chance till the end and I am glad I did. The story line gets more and more interesting to the point where I wanted to read the manga to know what's gonna happen next. Introduction of new characters and showing flashbacks ofthe character's background also got me hung up, wanting to find out more about what they were like and how they came to be what they are now. The unfolding of the mysteries introduced at the beginning and how things get riled up towards the end (how their might be conflict between marked and unmarked) also makes it all the more engaging.\\n\\n\r\nYou have to keep an open mind while watching, giving the anime a chance till after episode 5-6 and you will find its worth your time. I like that the season is short (12 episdoes) so it doesn't drag on too long. It's not very action based since it's a shoujo of course so emotions are a big part of the anime. It might not be the best anime to watch but it's one of the good ones. I hope they make season 2 cause I'd really like to know how the story unfolds.",

            "content": "TLDR: Ouni is the best part.\r\nSTORY:\r\nChildren of the Whales is ridiculously angsty. I mean there is a literal massacre early on with a character death that we're SUPPOSED to care about *eye roll.* It's like nachos but there's only one tortilla chip submerged in a sea of cheese.\r\nThe story finally picks up around episode 7, but who really wants to wait that long? Not me usually... \r\nTo be honest, for a story centered around emotions it took too many episodes for me to feel anything. \r\nOn top of that, the slice-of-life element leaves a serious mood whiplash.\r\nSN: WHY IN THE WORLD DO WE NEED AMPLEFOOTAGE OF A DUMB DANCE!?! She looked so stupid. (this will make sense to those that have watched it).\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nThe characters are really flat, and I couldn't stand Chakuro, the main character. He just seemed too cookie-cutter like many other anime male leads. \\n\\n\r\nOuni was my favorite though you could argue that he's a cardboard cut-out of an anti-hero. Still, I would've liked this show much better with him as the MC. \\n\\n\r\nLykos was boring. I've seen this character too many times. Nothing about her stands out.\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION:\\n\r\nIt was good. I think the style made some characters look a bit cutesy, but I liked it overall.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: (English Dub)\\n\r\nMusic is forgettable. \\n\r\nVoice-acting was meh/average. I feel like some voices fit the characters well but they had no passion for dramatic scenes or they were too weak like Suou's.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nIf you don't mind waiting a LONG TIME to pick up interest in a story, then you should try watching it. It was a real struggle for me to get past ep 2., but it's not the worst show. I thought Ouni was the gem of the show. \\n\\n\r\nStill, I will watch a season 2.",

            "content": "This series had a lot of potential. Interesting premise, mild intrigue, great art. Sadly, the plot becomes very inconsistent real quick, and eventually contradicts itself by finding a convenient excuse to throw away one of the fundamental premises. It also tries a little too hard to wax philosophical and overdramitizes death to the point of becoming obnoxious. The show had all the right ingredients to be great, but bad writing killed it.\r\nSince MAL requires reviews to be obscenely verbose, I will now talk about my milk shake.\r\nMy milk shake brings all the boys to the yard, and they're like, its better than yours.

            "content": "So I've seen quite a bit of anime and I was actually super frustrated just watching the first 6 episodes. Everything about it was gorgeous. The art, the music, the production, the world. They could have made this an adventure and story about love, honor, and sacrifice. Instead the characters are all depressing and mopey. When the main character's love interest dies, he's seemingly ok a few scenes later and he's actually smiling. It's like this story was written by a buddhist monk. There's barely any reaction. Anger should have been the most obvious reaction, but instead the main character writes words on walls andflirts with other girls after his childhood love interest literally just got killed in the same episode. I'm genuinely frustrated by the lack of any reaction to the death of characters. Instead of being angry, the elders just decide they should just all kill themselves and save the bad guy the trouble. ARE YOU FREAKIN REAL? This had so much potential, but I was actually angry that they wasted so much production value on such a garbage set of characters.",

It's a unique style of background art that's for sure. It reminded me of an old storybook & I actually liked it.\r\nThe character art is your standard cutsey art. Nothing new.\r\nSound. Meh. Nothing special. \r\nCHARACTERS / STORY:\r\nThe characters are dull & idiotic. We're supposed to care about these characters, but you end up just not caring because everyone is so weak & stupidly does things.\r\nStory also fallsflat. Interesting concept with the moving islands in the sand. Your average plot of one side thinking the other side is the devil & that's why they do bad things.\\n\r\nThey tried so hard to make a meaningful story, but failed to execute it because the writers straight up suck. It was very predictable. The narration was so unneeded. Everything that happened only happened because everyone was being dumb.\\n\r\nThis is the equivalent of an \"art student\" randomly splattering paint & then trying to make some philosophical meaning behind it.\\n\r\nI'm sure SOME people are thinking \"NO THIS WAS ABOUT THE NECESSITY OF HUMAN EMOTION\" blablablabla. Good for you. Bless your pure soul.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT / OVERALL:\\n\r\nI only kept watching it because I wanted to see if the plot would get better with the climax.\\n\r\nIt didn't. Ended up just finishing to finish.\\n\r\nBackground noise while I reviewed my class material.",
