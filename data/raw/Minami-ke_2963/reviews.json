            "content": "Funny doesn't even begin to cover it.  I laugh out loud every episode.  This show just really cracks me up.  It's just so absurd and lively and hilarious.\r\nStory: There's no real continuous plot.  It really is slice of life in that Seinfeldian \"show about nothing\" sort of way.  Despite the fact that there's no real story line, it manages to find such absurdity and humor in what should be the simplest, most mundane human interactions and relationships.  \r\nArt: Even the art is funny.  The characters' expressions and body language just adds to the unexpected humor of every situation,whether it's their over-the-top enthusiastic poses or the random adult glares they give each other once in a while.   The art is also consistent and despite the fact that the background characters all look similar, I find that they're all easy to distinguish from each other and that they are consistent through the series, which I like. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Okay, if you've ever seen any of my other reviews or anything -- I normally do not pay any attention to openings and endings, except to generically note that I don't like them.  I *LOVE* this show's opening and ending for some reason.  It's bouncy and bubbly and absolutely perfect for the show.  The opening is one of those cheerful running openings (like Gokusen) and it just hits the nail right on the head in terms of attitude and atmosphere of the show.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd the actors who do the voices of the three sisters do such a great job, especially the two younger sisters -- Chiaki is so deadpan and dry and Kana is so mindlessly enthusiastic.  Perfect. =)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  I don't know if I've ever seen just a compilation of silly, hilarious characters in one show before.  And it's really amazing that the show manages to balance all these ridiculous personalities together to work at making such a funny show without going too far and tiring out the audience.  Even the supporting characters you see for one or two episodes, like the various classmates of the girls, are charmingly wacky and endearing.  And don't forget the main characters!  These girls are each so individual and carefully created that you can almost guess how they'd react in conversations they've never had in the show.  They do a great job of subtly filling out all the details of their unique personalities that you get a very strong feeling that they're real and you know them, from the serene and nurturing Haruka to Kana's crazy, pedal to the metal perspective on life and the fact that little Chiaki makes you wonder if a dry, jaded old man somehow got stuck in an elementary school girl's body.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I love this show.  I've already rewatched episodes and it still cracks me up on repeat viewings.  And I think other people love this show too, but this is just my guess. ;)  Go watch this show!!",

            "content": "Okay well considering there are 7 reviews about minami ke when i finished watching this. So How am i going to get this review noticed? Easy and in one sentence too.\r\n95% like Ichigo Mashimaro \r\nBut what do you expect from the same production company? (Domu)\r\nNow with that said. Everything about this screams Ichigo Mashimaro. Sure theres only \"3 main characters\" as opposed to 5 main characters. Three would be the bare minimum for a slice of life comedy about a plain depiction of the days of the lives of the Minami sisters. Even before the show starts it says don't expect to much. What theysay is 100% truth considering its practically Ichigo-M sequel. Now it is up to the viewer to figure out if that is a good thing or bad thing. And in my opinion its a VERY good thing. \\n\\n\r\nTwo of the main characters are complete polar opposites.Kana is they energetic outgoing idiot, whereas Chiakiis the quiet conservative genius. The third sister, Haruka is only there as an easy medium to balance out the Minami-ke formula. Haruka is such a perfect &quot;in-between&quot; character that i love her the most of the three. She can be cool headed, hot headed, smart, AND dumb and still make it all believable. What also helps the characters out is such a STRONG Seiyu cast. Allthough it does feel like they did a little type-casting. Like Marina Inoue does the voice of Kana, she also did the voice for Yoko (Gurren Lagann) and Mina (Getsumento). And Minori Chihara (of Yuki Nagato and Minami Iwasaki fame) doing the voice as the usually quiet Haruka. A good thing about typecasting though is that you know that you're getting a perfect voice for that character and these girls are perfect for their roles. But one can't help that the characters are cookie cutter replicas of Miu and Chika  (Kana and Chiaki)in manner attitude and habits. \\n\\n\r\nArtwork is pretty standard fare coming from Domu, all pastel colors. It all works just fine to promote a warm cozy enviroment. Never any harsh, quick action moving, visuals. There are a few high kicks thrown in for laughs but overall the humor and comedy keeps the visuals from being too much of a distraction. Everything might be in pastel, but everything is accounted for. Laundry hanging on the balcony, to the different ingredients of their snacks and dinners. The enviroment looks very plain but lets not forget this is a story about 3 girls. So everything is usually going to be very clean and organized and you will notice that right away. Literally the only settings that are shown for this show is going to be the girls apartment and the classroom. Each episode will have a different location to keep things fresh but things are usually kept in those two locations. Another nice art twist is how they do the shadowy face and the teardrop mouth. They're good choices to keep the animations a little more unique. \\n\\n\r\nThe strongest part of the show is the comedy and if you know anything about Domu is that this is where they shine the best. No matter what setting they have, just as long as they have girls in the story they can make the funniest situations out of NOTHING. They can make drinking a bottle of water or sitting a table hilarious. And thats what most people will love about this show. Theres no story (comon its a sitcom) don't bother trying to find one. They tell at the start of every episode there is no story, just funny situations. There is not enough props for Domu for making some of the best sitcom anime in the industry ^_^ Whats so great about their story telling is that it feels so fresh and more hilarious with every new episode. You can watch any episode and will still be funny to you 10 years from now. \\n\\n\r\nWell I'm sure I've beaten the cookie cutter aspect of the show to a pulp by now but one thing that isnt the same as Ichigo-M is that its not as infected with cuteness as its predecessor. And thats why I will score this higher than Ichigo-M. Me being american, sitcoms will always have a place in my life. Of course sitcom anime isn't for some people. If you don't like sitcoms or too analytical for a sitcom then please dont watch this. If you want to watch funny things unfold for random characters then this show is just for you! Regardless this is another hit made by Doumu.",

            "content": "Story (8/10)\r\nMinami-ke is a slice of life comedy centring on the three Minami sisters (no mention of any other family except a distant relative) and their friends as they go about their lives \u2013 usually with hilarious consequences. Each episode is portrayed in short segments spread throughout, much like azumanga diaoh with each segment having its own theme, but usually fitting round a general episodic storyline. The vast majority of the story takes place at the girls various schools (each sister attends a grade school) and at home, giving a wide scope for hilarity to ensue, with most of the comedy coming from the youngersisters Chiaki and Kana. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough there may not be a storyline moving towards a dramatic ending, as the genre\u2019s nature is, each episode is well written to bring a smile to the face. The way the story is portrayed with the characters and the styling, make this one of the most fun and enjoyable series that you\u2019ll watch \u2013 its just good fun.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Minami-ke is commonly called soft art, whatever they call it, it fits in with the story and the characters brilliantly. The character designs are some of the best I have seen, every aspect of the characters is well animated, and I love the facial animations \u2013 especially the tear drop mouth. The backgrounds are all nicely done, and the schools and Minami home are all animated well.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint with the animation is the tendency to switch styles when the girls are being serious to a more hardened styling. The first time it happens it\u2019s quite a shock, usually involving facial close ups, with additional details added to the eyes and nose detail \u2013 it just seems out of place with the rest of the animation being so soft, and they could probably have had the same effect without resorting to a different animation style. This is a small complaint though and the rest of the artwork is beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound. (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP isn\u2019t to my tastes but is lively, happy and catchy, generally a good mood setter for the series, the ED is again lively and if anything catchier than the OP. The voice acting is of a high standard throughout the anime, everything sounding right, from Kana\u2019s relentlessly enthusiastic voice to Chiaki\u2019s slightly deeper (not in a bad way!) dead pan voice work really well with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music involved reminds me of the background music from azumanga diaoh - it sets the pace of the segments where it is used, and is normally timed for comedic effect and adds in that extra little bit of fun to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis show works because of its strong range of characters and supporting characters throughout the series, with most of the supporting characters getting better development than main characters from other animes.\\n\\n\r\nThe Minami sisters work brilliantly well, with Kana\u2019s abundance of energy and lack of common sense being offset by Chiaki\u2019s superior wit and intolerance for idiots. That said it\u2019s up to Haruka to keep the peace, although this is not easy as both siblings vie for Haruka\u2019s affection at every turn. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is very strong, with a few strong recurring characters, each of them likeable, my only complaint was about the gender bending Makoto/Mako, while his initial cross dressing was hilarious, the more often \u2018Mako\u2019 turned up the less I liked the character, however this was somewhat offset with the introduction of Touma (not really a gender bender, as had it forced upon her) later in the series, which seemed to give Makoto a counter balance which I felt was needed.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this show such a success is the way the characters combine, and would not have been half as funny if the extensive range of characters were not involved. The continual battle of wits between Chiaki and Kana is brilliant to watch, and the way they both manipulate their friends into their schemes is highly amusing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyability (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the most enjoyable series I have seen, the characters are wonderfully developed and animated and the scripting for the episodes is brilliant \u2013 you\u2019ll get at least on good laugh out of every episode, which is basically what this type of series is about, putting a smile of the viewers face.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nMiname-ke sets a high standard across the board for it portrayal of brilliant characters, fantastic animation and brilliant use of music. Each storyline brings something new, and you never know what to expect except that its going to be hilarious. I had been looking for a while for something that could compete for laughs with azumanga diaoh\u2019s slapstick comedy and in Miname-ke I found it \u2013 in fact its probably the best anime of its type out there at the moment.\\n",

            "content": "Minami-ke is a Slice of Lice, Comedy about the ordinary lives of 3 ordinary sisters. You can&rsquo;t get more ordinary than this, yet the mild mannered comedy is a sure win. \r\nThis short series is a typical slice of life, portraying the usual daily lives of 3 sisters. The story is basically structured by going from one random short story/event to the next with not much liking these events together. There&rsquo;s nothing complex about story as the events are just the usual things we all experience in life: eat, go to school, hang out with friends, study and sleep. The only thing that makes thisslice of life interesting is the comedy side of things. There&rsquo;s quite a lot of light-hearted humour scattered around, with a lot of it being some kind of pun or just making fun typical clich&eacute;s. But the comedy wouldn&rsquo;t be as good, if it weren&rsquo;t for the likable characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe three Minami sisters are the main characters that make the series so enjoyable. First we have Haruka the well-mannered and responsible older sister, Kana the idiotic and eccentric middle sister and finally we have Chiaki the cute, cold-hearted little sister. The way they interact with one another is hilarious and the supporting characters are enjoyable to watch as well (Hosaka).\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance the animation looks as ordinary as the series with no need to flesh it out, on parodies and such. The change in their facial expressions adds to the hilarity of the series and overall it is also fairly fluid. The music is okay for this slice of life but it doesn&rsquo;t add or take away anything from the viewing experience, as it feels more like a neutral element.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Minami-ke is a great light-hearted comedy, showing the ordinary lives of ordinary girls however the level of comedy can seem pretty stale for some but the rest of us will enjoy it. I particularly enjoyed the &ldquo;Sensei and Ninomiya-kun&rdquo; moments that randomly popped up throughout the series. So if you tired of watching the same old shounen anime or just want more of the same thing from other similar comedies, then this is worth checking out. \\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "I just recently finished watching Minami-ke, and now, among other watchers, I'm sure, waiting to see the second series because I just enjoyed it that much.\r\nMinami-ke's story is simple: 3 sisters living on their own living their daily lives. The pacing is slow, but since the genre is slice-of-life, it doesn't need to go any faster. No romance can be found here (though there are the slight moments of infatuation and sexual references). \r\nEach episode had something about it that usually would make one laugh out loud. There is just something about the girls' personalities and their relationship with one another that makes it sofunny- especially with Kana and Chiaki.\\n\\n\r\nI loved all the characters, personal favorite being Kana, the densest of this sisters and also the craziest. Chiaki, the youngest sister, doesn't take crap from anybody, yet she shows a gentle side around her older sister at times. The older sister is Haruka, the domestic sister who plays the role of the mother (where are the parents, anyway?!). All the characters are so silly and likeable- including every supporting one as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending theme work well; I  liked the upbeat and wacky feeling to the opening theme. I also really liked the music in the background, each track fit in with what was going on with the scene. The voice actors were perfect- especially with Chiaki, deadpan, arrogant, and with a no-nonsense tone.\\n\\n\r\nTo the bored, to the comedic anime-deprived, to anyone at all, Minami-ke is a perfect choice to brighten a day with its antics.",

            "content": "When I first heard about this \"comedy/slice of life\" anime, it seems like all I ever heard was how much this title is like another anime called Ichigo Mashimaro. I have to say that they were indeed right, it is a lot like it! In fact just watching this anime, feels more along the lines of an actual \"anime sitcom.\"\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nSince this is a \"slice of life\" anime it has to be rated on its episode by episode plots. Her we find ourselves partaking in the daily lives of the three Minami sisters, who live alone in an apartment. The story will range from oneof the supporting male members trying to confess their love for one of them, to the girls having problematic trouble at school. One odd thing that caught my eye was the fact that more than 80% of the actual anime takes place either in the three sister\u2019s living room, or at school. One important aspect that this title makes sure to do with its story, is keeping the audience entertained. This is especially true with \"the slice of life genera.\" And I am happy to say that Minami-ke does it very well. The situations that occur can be down right funny at times. Kana is probably the funniest of the anime, she is so random and says things that might fly over the viewer\u2019s head, its the kind of humor that is intentionally not suppose to make sense though. (especially since her sisters don\u2019t get half of them either) Now its not all left up to this one character to keep the episodes funny, as Miname-ke is also complimented with a very funny supporting cast. One of the best ones is a guy named \"Makoto, \" he is not welcomed into the sisters apartment, (one of them isn\u2019t too fond of him for her own reasons) so he decides to dress up as a girl in order to visit them when he wants to, which many female jokes are played off of. I can\u2019t say that all the episodes are winners, as some were definitely better than others, but it overall came together. Unsurprisingly there isn\u2019t any real end to this season, (there are two others, one of which will air next year) as you could pretty much place the final episode anywhere in the count and it wouldn\u2019t matter.\\n\\n\r\nMiname-ke doesn\u2019t push any envelopes with its content, but does include some \"female style jokes\" that may raise an eyebrow with children, nothing over a PG rating though.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork: 8/10\\n\r\nIts pretty good, it certainly won\u2019t win any awards in the art department, as its suppose to come off more as a soft style anime, and that is how it can be best described as...\"soft art.\" For some reason the characters mouths seemed to stand out for me, because of their more triangular shapes, they almost would remind me of rabbits...or perhaps fish. (maybe its just my own imagination) One thing I found to be kind of creepy, was when ever on of the sisters would get into a more serious mood, they drew them like evil eyed adults. Not sure why they did this, it seemed a bit out of place and unnecessary, and felt a tad over used in the end.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 7/10\\n\r\nBoth closing and opening themes are port-raid in a happy up beat song, it kind of makes you feel like you can do anything once you watch them both. (kind of gun-ho style of songs) The background music is pretty sparse as expected, many scenes occur with no tracks at all, trying again to appeal to a more relaxed feel. When it does play some it comes in the form of a soft \"piano style\" melody, I really liked it! The best part though is the character voices, all of them fit well with one another and I couldn\u2019t find one out of place with the character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nIn any slice of life anime the characters are a crucial part of the series, you can\u2019t enjoy it unless you like them. Thankfully these three sisters each have their own likable personalities; which range from out going (Kana), to very discrete (Chiaki), to some where in the middle. (Haruka the eldest) Some people may be turned off some what by Kana, since she tends to like doing things her own way, and does seem to interfere with situations at time, but nothing major. The only real bad thing I can think of regarding the characters, is that since this is a comedy title-- many of them (the supporting cast) tend to act like one another, and some of them we never really get to know who they are. To help with this though, the more unique supporting characters do get pretty good spotlight time, as the anime will tend to shift to their situations at times. Which was nice, and won\u2019t make you feel like you\u2019re just watching the three sisters all the time.\\n\\n\r\nBottom Line: 8/10\\n\r\nMinami-ke is a nice title if you\u2019re in the mood for a more realistic sense of humor. The characters aren\u2019t particularly deep, but the humor in this is what makes the anime a winner! The three sisters are a likable and funny bunch, and should capture your hearts when it's over. It's by no means a perfect anime, but regardless...this is still one \"slice of life\" anime, that is worth sampling a piece of.",

To be frank, this series is absolutely boring. I do have a broad taste in humor an also often laugh about things most people wouldn't even take as a joke - in short - i don't hesistate when there's something remotely funny. But in this show the only real funny thing was the running gag about the drama tv show the three sisters are following. \"sensei!\" ... \"ninomya-kun!\" ... \"sensei!\"\r\nThat got me giggle every now andthen, but the rest was plain mediocre. At some point i was hoping that they would turn it into a love triangle rom-com. Then at least something interesting would be going on. \\n\\n\r\nBut, i don't wanna bash this show. In all fairness they at least apologize before each episode so i can't be too hard on them. It was alright, but do take the intro sentence seriously! They mean it. It is ordinary and may be overlooked without regrets.",

            "content": "Honestly speaking,Minami-ke is my first slice-of-life anime to be watched.Since my very first viewing in 2013,I have reviewed it for at least 20 times and actually fell in love with those types.Much Obliged to Minami-ke for providing me a gate to such a realistic but also marvelous new world :) \r\nStory(9/10)\r\nThe story itself ,centering around the daily life of the three Minami sisters and their acquaintances,is so simplistic that even leaves few and far between trails of exaggeration commonly used in many other slice-of-life animes.Therefore,I might ask you \u201cdon\u2019t expect too much from it\u201d(confession time,I plagiarize the phrase from the Chiaki\u2019s ).But,owing to the seeminglyplain storytelling gimmick ,it is successfully crafted more than a mediocre comedy \u2014 in other words, not only does it manage to avoid being a dull and daily live broadcast,but also succeed in striking more responsive chords in your heart in that you would be definitely confounded by the very down-to-earth scenes,perhaps some of which you already went through in an identical or similar way.\\n\\n\r\nBesides,I might mention that the show-within-a-show Sensei To Ninomiya Kun, to which translated the teacher and his student Niomiya ,is so nonsensical and anti-climatic but funny enough that you shouldn\u2019t miss it .\\n\\n\r\nArt\uff088/10)\\n\r\nIn the first place\uff0cits palette characteristic of pastel shade disposes you refreshing and agreeable towards that series,and creates a gentle tone actually fitting the motif of a slice-of-life comedy .In the second place,the design of the shape of mouth is just like a water-drop ,hence an excessively cute impression is made and I like this superb idea of designing so much. And a pair of stretched arms accompanying the water-drop\u2019s shaped mouth is surely more preferable.\\n\\n\r\nThere might be some flaws from your own palate,and I do agree  that\u201c the tendency to switch styles when the girls are being serious to a more hardened styling...it just seems out of place with the rest of the animation being so soft,...\u201d,opined the user GeneralCox.But for some others such as my sister ,it might be observed as an amusing comparison and spice added to the soft art.It is reminiscent of another famously slice-of-life anime Nichijou\uff0cbearing an abundance of  the utilization of comparsion in facial expression as well.However,from my point of view,Nichijou applies it much better.Nevertheless, the few flaws,probably subjective to some extent, are not totally important in effect.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe background music,surely excluded the role music for Hosaka(Gracious!Mentioning the name is immediately reminiscent of his wacky and insane laughter,\u201dahaha,ahaha,ahahaha\u201d) ,is dolce and makes you revel in its storyline .Besides,both the opening and ending theme is catchy, chirpy and funny with the concomitant shots of the main trio\u2019s and their friend\u2019s daily life , though I slightly prefer the latter to the former owing to its nice soothing tone,particularly with the emergence of the scene depicting the three Minami sisters looking up at the ether.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis show crafts a wide range of diverse characters,from the main ones to the supporting part,whereas none of whom would make you feel redundant.You will soon grow fond of the mischievous and carefree girl Kana with a pedal-to-the-metal outlook,the deadpan Chiaki always with a pair of drowsy eyes ,and the sublime beauty Haruka sort of the Yamato Nadeshiko(\u5927\u548c\u64ab\u5b50), denoting the ideal type of womanhood in Japan yet not actually the same as the ACGN\u2019s one always bound up with sister-con.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the supporting characters are also absolutely impressive and individual as the main ones ,I am not going to spout and rave about how joyous they have brought me and how successful while put them all in combination with the three Minami sisters ,considering many great answers already been submitted.But I might add that the personality shaping itself of each character is detailed and fantastic enough as well,that is to say,it never means to be transferred into an one-fold process, albeit under the idea of simplistic crafting.And that\u2019s why we can catch glimpses of the dreadful stares or menacing gestures coming from the supposedly serene Haruka,while Hosaka is a genuine versatile bloke with the ability of doing everything with great dexterity in spite of his somewhat disgusting behaviour.Also,you might think it\u2019s hard to believe Kana isn\u2019t an idiot until you witnessed her some cunning behaviour such as trying to transform the little boy Makoto into a loli \"Mako-chan\",or Fujioka Kun isn\u2019t no more than a brooding\u201cBanchou\u201d,pending some sweet scenes to be seen,for example, he dressed like a Santa Claus so as to send Chiaki a toy of grizzly bear as gift in Christmas Eve .Likewise,Chiaki not always pose a jaded face especially concerning the interactions with her most admired sister Haruka,whereas Touma\u2019s great talent for weaving makes you wonder if Minami Touma a real tomboy?All the remaining supporting characters are similarly well-done within mere 13 episodes, though this review is confirmed to lapse into a tedious harangue had I incessantly enumerated the diverse aspects in each character.However,you will never have a chance of finding out the subtle workmanship of characters striking a discordant note with the simplistic storyline and slice-of-life settings.\\n\r\nMeanwhile ,homage should be paid to the seiyuus of this series,good job.It would be impossible for the anime to immaculately come across without seiyuus\u2019 enthusiastic and technical voice acting ,especially when it comes to display its characters\u2019 respective likeable features with their individually quirky foibles.Not to mention the fantastic fusion while all the characters come into interactions with each other.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9/10):\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps most of us were initially more intrigued by a fictional world full of fantasy,plots,magic,moe elements,hot-blooded actions,love affairs,or so on,due to our yearning for an idealistic and disparate world. But later we might seek to find something more realistic for the sake of procuring more resonances in a more similar world,and probably that is one of the reasons why slice-of-life anime can be so widespread.As many MAL users have already pointed out that this Minami-ke series is so realistic that makes you think that either the main or supporting characters are real persons in reality,its delicate shaping of personality still makes you feel it\u2019s a totally light-hearted comedy rather than a gritty reality documentary.Therefore,it seems that Minami-ke is an authentic warm place existing in somewhere,maybe your house or your heart,while its door always open to welcome you after hours of hard toil from workplace. The Minami sisters and their friends are so hospitable\uff0cas if your really existing besties you can confide in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(9/10)\\n\\n\r\nBased on the aforementioned discussed, I gave an overall rate 9.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for your feedback.",

The characters are wonderful; it's not one of those comedies that feels like random gags, but slice-of-life where the humor is more integrated in day-to-day happenings (even though there isn't much in the way of story progression).\r\nThe artwork is very well done, but it's made for the humor, not necessarily to be pretty.  Especially Kana's expressions crack me up.  And her \"I AM BOSS\" t-shirt makes me laugh every time I think about it.  Actually pretty much everything about Kana cracks me up.  The voiceacting is also excellent, and really strengthens the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIt seemed really awkward that they'd change animation styles when the animators were trying to poke fun at the characters being serious, but instead of becoming less detailed in animation (like normal humor), it became more detailed.  Sometimes it was funny, but usually it was just weird.",

            "content": "Going into this show, I had no real expectations for it. From the get go, Minami-ke looked like your typical slice of life/comedy anime. However, after watching all 13 episodes in one sitting, I realized something. I realized that Minami-ke does what many other similar titles don't; and that is having characters that aren't one dimensional or are there just to fulfill a trope or stereotype.\r\nMinami-ke is about the life of three sisters, Chiaki, Kana and Haruka, and their daily activities as they grow up. Chiaki is the youngest of the three sisters, being in elementary school. Despite being the youngest of the three, shehas surprisingly high intelligence, which she uses to her advantage to make fun of or tease Kana.\\n\\n\r\nKana, being the middle sister, is a rather lazy and noisy girl who prefers doing as little work as possible. Kana loves food, but she is a terrible cook so she relies on her sisters to do the cooking.\\n\\n\r\nHaruka is the eldest of the three sisters, and arguably the most mature. She acts like a mother for Kana and Chiaki, since their parents are overseas. When she is by herself, she becomes unbelievably lazy, even more so than Kana.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Minami-ke work so well is the combination of a charming cast of characters and a laid back atmosphere. The show is rather slow paced, which might be a negative for some people, but in my opinion it adds to the overall nature of the show. There are times where a scene drags on for just a little bit too long and you get bored, but in general there are enough different things happening throughout each episode to keep you interested.\\n\\n\r\nMinami-ke's art is simple, yet effective for setting the mood. I will say that the character designs do change between seasons, but since this is a review for the first season, I won't go into detail about it.\\n\\n\r\n-Pros-\\n\\n\r\n- Likeable cast of characters\\n\r\n- Art style fits this kind of show\\n\r\n- Interesting character interactions\\n\r\n- Very funny and engaging\\n\\n\r\n-Cons-\\n\\n\r\n- A bit too slow paced at times\\n\r\n- As per usual in comedies, some people may not find the jokes funny\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Minami-ke is a must-watch if you're into comedy/slice of life anime. It is very engaging, and I enjoyed almost every minute of it.",

It's not your everyday-wacky-ultra-exaggerated comedy anime, This is a good example of comedy anime honestly.\r\nSelling Point(s):\r\nCharacter's charm,  Light but yet silly enough hillarious moments, nice directing for the pace of the anime\r\nReason Of Liking the anime:\r\nThis anime almost killed me. From start to the end, i was forced to laugh out loud, even i 've tried as hard as possible not to. Mysteriously, with the 3 sisters , Haruka (gentle and kind), Kana (silly + idiotic) , and Chiaki (Moe(?) + arrogant), they have formed such great chemical mixture of charm, which cant stop the people from loving them. Ifyou think those 3 sisters are enough, you better off check out the side characters .. though you might end out having stroke for laughing too much.\\n\\n\r\nThe story - well, pretty much common slice of life, but with the nice directing skill applied to anime, every momments is the classic, packed with  tons of light humor. What's great is  that, this anime  doesn't even need to be shoved in fan services just to make a fan laugh!  A definitely a must watch for those who look for true comedy genre anime.\\n\\n\r\na 10 for this classic comedy anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I Dislike:\\n\r\nNone\\n\\n\r\nAdvice(s):\\n\r\n1) For all ages, a must watch if you want to laugh your misery away.\\n\r\n2) Beware of traps.\\n\r\n3) No, you don't have to join a volleyball club.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Judging from the intro, I assumed this was going to be a pretty bland slice of life anime. The characters seemed okay, the plot was basic, but then I found a whole new level of enjoyment within the characters themselves as soon as I heard them talk.\r\nRight off the bat, we are given an anime where we have a smartass elementary girl whom still has lots of innocence, a bratty, yet surprisingly intelligent at times, middle schooler and a somewhat slutty in a few areas, yet very responsible high school girl; and the experiences they each deliver are cutting edge comedy.\r\nIt has been forever sinceI have seen a slice of life that is as enjoyable as Minami-ke. Every character they introduce is lovable or at least unforgettable in some way. The plot is not too thick, but the comedy is much more! Its delivery of jokes never fail to amuse me, the scenery of their apartment and schools are very bright, colorful and detailed and lastly, even if you do not like slice of life comedies, you would still feel above neutral when watching this one. That is, unless you have an idiosyncrasy for tsundere characters, which one of the characters does and does not fit into due to the confusing nature of her personality.\\n\\n\r\nIn most of my recent anime reviews, I have normally had a nitpicking about the negative part right after this as most have not given me much to remember, but I actually have none for this one. It does well on what it delivers and you would only be offended if you were expecting something else. But, the very essence of this anime is pure comedy and God foreboded no serious elements to ever befall it.\\n\\n\r\nI would go on about the characters, but I have made this review to be in a way where you can only see the good in this anime without knowing everything that there is to come of it yet. If you want full enjoyment out of this anime, you must figure out the characters on your own, but as I said before, you will barely find a moment where you will be bored of this anime. It is very energetic; and yet, it can also be very calming at the same time sometimes due to the genre it is in. I can not recommend it enough as it renewed my faith in anime comedies after finding so many lackluster ones over the past several months, with a few notable exceptions here and there.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you haven't already, give it a chance. If you have, give it ANOTHER chance. Perhaps, you judged it too soon and quit watching. I did this once with a different comedy and when I came back to it, I regretted not watching it sooner.",

            "content": "Summary of Story:\r\nThere are three of the Minami sisters: Haruka, Kana and Chiaki, who have an average life. The girls only have each other to depend on and help each other get through everything from love confessions to cooking.\r\nAnimation:\r\nThe animation may have been a little bit rough, but its high colors and smooth movements kept these points up! The facial expression of each girl where positively great, the use of going from detailed expressions to the simple lines was hilarious. The backgrounds were OK, nothing to really brandish about, and the background characters where OK as well, to the point where they all did lookthe same. Not like in Soul Eater... 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOpening Theme:\\n\r\nKeikenchi Joshochu\u2606 by Uran\\n\\n\r\nEnding Theme:\\n\r\nColorful DAYS by Uran\\n\\n\r\nI really liked this OST, one because it was so simple, and added to the comedy in the show. Without it, some parts of the show would be really boring and unfunny. The opening and ending songs, of course sung by the girls, were so upbeat and matched the show perfectly. Also, this is my first time mentioning it, but the actors where perfect. Giving these girls and guys any other actors would have made such a smaller impact than the originals. Great work seiyuus! :D 10/10\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nTake three girls, sisters to be exact, and see their every days lives. The comedy. OH the comedy. As others have said, this show is a a story about... Nothing. There is no real plot line, seeing as it was based off 4koma. (4 paneled comics) There isn't supposed to be a plot. If there really where a plot, the show would not have been as funny. You could compare it to Ichigo Mashimaro. I mean, Minami-Ke is almost exactly like it. But I liked Minami-Ke a lot more. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters make this show what it is. Literally. There's the Minami sister. Chiaki (the old man shoved inside a 10 year old's body), Kana (Someone seriously give her Ritalin)and Haruka (The good housewife). The story revolves around them, and shows what sisters REALLY act like. They were so different, and so sister like. Believe me, I know. I have a sister Kana's age. Then you get to their schools. This is where the good characters come in. There's Makoto (In Chiaki's class) With his absolutely adorableness and love for cross dressing, he became my favorite character. His cuteness is over powering. Then theirs Akira and Fujioka (In Kana's class). Akira is a dork who lives next door to Kana, who wants a girlfriend with long hair. Fujioka has a huge crush on Kana, and is jealous over the time she is spending with Akira. Although, Kana doesn't notice Fujioka's feelings and sees him as a threat/gang leader instead. Then... And then there is Hosaka. I really do NOT know how to describe this guy. Seriously. Just watch the show. You'll understand afterwards. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nValue/Enjoyment:\\n\r\nIf you are depressed and need a great pick me up, watch this. You will forget you were even depressed, that's how much this show will have you smiling. 10/10",

Each and every episode had at least one thing you could laugh about. The dynamic between the sisters almost feels natural messing with each other getting revenge and then coming to a sweet resolution. \r\nI like the youngest character the best she's smart and snippy always messing with the middle sister.\r\nThe middles sister I like the least she does things that can be so annoying and make me want to physically hit her, but that also shows howinvested you can get with the characters. They feel so real that you want to interact with them.\\n\\n\r\nI also really like how they integrate other character so flawlessly it's not forced or awkward.  Bancho!",

            "content": "Minami-Ke is a bit of an oddball show, even for the slice-of-life genre. The character designs are more realistic than the far more popular Azumanga Daioh and Lucky Star (and it took be a bit to get used to the whole tear shaped mouth thing), and the plot is somewhat sporatic, bouncing form episodic to continuity at random (all animes do this, of course, but in the same episode?). These aren't complaints, however, just the facts. Really I can't think of anything bad to say about the series except that the pacing's a bit slow at first. Stick with it, though, and a taste forMinami-Ke's unique style should develop. The characters manage to define themselves in the viewer's mind, even when they go several episodes without reappearing. The reaccuring elements are delightful, as are the more singular stories told (the later experiences several peaks, but hardly any lows from what I recall). Despite the potential for such, fanservice plays a very small part in the show, appearing here and there, but never making its presence known until the last couple of episodes. The whole thing is over before you know it, but fortunately, the show makes it clear that a second season is on the way. While this is a show that requires a bit of a gear sift to get into, the overall effort one makes is totally worth the end result, as Minami-Ke is probably one of the best anime of its kind.",

            "content": "Review from Zagrom, Otaku-Unlimited.net\r\nThis is a slice of life, comedy series based around the life of three sisters.\r\nMinami Haruka, the eldest sister, the sweet and motherly sister.  She is also the most reliable of the three sisters but is lazy when left alone. Although the oldest she is still a second year of high school. And in junior high through several misunderstandings obtained the nickname Banch\u014d (or badass, used to refer to a leader of delinquents, etc, etc)\r\nMinami Kana (my favorite) the family retard, or baka if I may. The middle sister, second year junior high. The type of girl that nearly always actsbefore thinking, does poorly in school (she misreads kanji a lot) she tends to find excuses to make things more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nMinami Chiaki, they youngest sister in elementary (I estimate 5th year, perhaps sixth?) She is made out to be highly intelligent by her friends but it seems that she thinks of things in a rather simple way. She things VERY highly of Haruka and is very formal with her, but uses the term bakayar\u014d (a more strict form of baka) with Kana often.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes: 13\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nI cant really explain much being a slice of life series, there is no real plot. There are plenty of \"love triangles\" but I use that term losely as really there is no proper shape to give it, the love goes all over the place and really does keep things about as funny as it gets. All in all the story all fits together, is easy to get, and is overall funny, A+\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nGreat job on this, alto only 13 episodes you seem to get plenty of time to see almost all the characters grow and change in the series and really get to get a hold of there personality's, and all of them have there on style and stories, no copy paste at all.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\r\nLiked all the back ground music, and OP and ED, not mush else to say, I watched every OP (normally just do it on first and last episode) Love that OP song  ^^\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nArt was clean and interesting, there were really two styles, which is sort of hard to explain unless you watch it, there is the main style (like the image above) and a more serious one that comes up from time to time, mostly between the three Minami sisters when they become more serious between one another, whicch I found weird the first few times but it became normal and then sorta grew on me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nHas become me second favorite series behind Lucky Star with ease, that should say enough (for me anyway). Highly recommended and one with a high rewatching value in my opinion, also note it has a second season Minami-ke Okawari\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Note that this was my first MAL review, hope you enjoyed)",

            "content": "Minami-ke isn't just another slice-of-life comedy that revolves around some main characters. Well, it does do that, but there is a mystical energy that comes from it that makes it not only funny, but pretty addictive to watch.\r\nThe whole story revolves around 3 sisters who have distinct personalities. There's Haruka, the eldest who is the most responsible of the three. She maintains the household, manages their bills, cooks the food and keeps everything in order in the house. There's Kana, the middle sister who has an energy that can't be beat. Although she's lazy and very gullible by her younger sister, she still shows hercreativity in some of her plans in the series. And finally there's Chiaki, the youngest who is the straight man who has the most negative attitude towards Kana and yet is kindest towards Haruka. Chiaki loves to mess with Kana as to misinterpret her love letters from a classmate of Kana's and keeps calling her dumbass. But it drives the story onwards.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, there practically isn't a story here. It is practically a Seinfeld of anime. There are many scenes in their home, scenes in their school and just daily observations and creative ideas that are bounced around in each episode. What makes it stand out is during some scenes, the attitude in the moment changes to a more serious attitude with a widescreen look and a more detailed view of each of the sister's faces. Funny at certain times, but can get kind of annoying at some moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe content in this anime is pretty unique. Some of the episodes have them not doing anything and just hanging out around in their house where Kana and Chiaki are watching a funny soap opera titled &quot;Sensei and Ninomiya-kun&quot; where those words are all that they say. The elements of comedy in it are pretty original as well as some subjects could possibly be what bored girls could be talking about if they were to get together and talk about random stuff.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this was very enjoyable. I laughed a lot, quoted a lot of scenes with my friends and made me think a little at some points. Minami-ke has an addictive quality that made me impatient for the next episode. If you liked Azumanga Daioh and the like, you'll like Minami-ke.",

            "content": "Funny doesn't even begin to cover it.  I laugh out loud every episode.  This show just really cracks me up.  It's just so absurd and lively and hilarious.\r\nStory: There's no real continuous plot.  It really is slice of life in that Seinfeldian \"show about nothing\" sort of way.  Despite the fact that there's no real story line, it manages to find such absurdity and humor in what should be the simplest, most mundane human interactions and relationships.  \r\nArt: Even the art is funny.  The characters' expressions and body language just adds to the unexpected humor of every situation,whether it's their over-the-top enthusiastic poses or the random adult glares they give each other once in a while.   The art is also consistent and despite the fact that the background characters all look similar, I find that they're all easy to distinguish from each other and that they are consistent through the series, which I like. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Okay, if you've ever seen any of my other reviews or anything -- I normally do not pay any attention to openings and endings, except to generically note that I don't like them.  I *LOVE* this show's opening and ending for some reason.  It's bouncy and bubbly and absolutely perfect for the show.  The opening is one of those cheerful running openings (like Gokusen) and it just hits the nail right on the head in terms of attitude and atmosphere of the show.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd the actors who do the voices of the three sisters do such a great job, especially the two younger sisters -- Chiaki is so deadpan and dry and Kana is so mindlessly enthusiastic.  Perfect. =)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  I don't know if I've ever seen just a compilation of silly, hilarious characters in one show before.  And it's really amazing that the show manages to balance all these ridiculous personalities together to work at making such a funny show without going too far and tiring out the audience.  Even the supporting characters you see for one or two episodes, like the various classmates of the girls, are charmingly wacky and endearing.  And don't forget the main characters!  These girls are each so individual and carefully created that you can almost guess how they'd react in conversations they've never had in the show.  They do a great job of subtly filling out all the details of their unique personalities that you get a very strong feeling that they're real and you know them, from the serene and nurturing Haruka to Kana's crazy, pedal to the metal perspective on life and the fact that little Chiaki makes you wonder if a dry, jaded old man somehow got stuck in an elementary school girl's body.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I love this show.  I've already rewatched episodes and it still cracks me up on repeat viewings.  And I think other people love this show too, but this is just my guess. ;)  Go watch this show!!",

            "content": "Okay well considering there are 7 reviews about minami ke when i finished watching this. So How am i going to get this review noticed? Easy and in one sentence too.\r\n95% like Ichigo Mashimaro \r\nBut what do you expect from the same production company? (Domu)\r\nNow with that said. Everything about this screams Ichigo Mashimaro. Sure theres only \"3 main characters\" as opposed to 5 main characters. Three would be the bare minimum for a slice of life comedy about a plain depiction of the days of the lives of the Minami sisters. Even before the show starts it says don't expect to much. What theysay is 100% truth considering its practically Ichigo-M sequel. Now it is up to the viewer to figure out if that is a good thing or bad thing. And in my opinion its a VERY good thing. \\n\\n\r\nTwo of the main characters are complete polar opposites.Kana is they energetic outgoing idiot, whereas Chiakiis the quiet conservative genius. The third sister, Haruka is only there as an easy medium to balance out the Minami-ke formula. Haruka is such a perfect &quot;in-between&quot; character that i love her the most of the three. She can be cool headed, hot headed, smart, AND dumb and still make it all believable. What also helps the characters out is such a STRONG Seiyu cast. Allthough it does feel like they did a little type-casting. Like Marina Inoue does the voice of Kana, she also did the voice for Yoko (Gurren Lagann) and Mina (Getsumento). And Minori Chihara (of Yuki Nagato and Minami Iwasaki fame) doing the voice as the usually quiet Haruka. A good thing about typecasting though is that you know that you're getting a perfect voice for that character and these girls are perfect for their roles. But one can't help that the characters are cookie cutter replicas of Miu and Chika  (Kana and Chiaki)in manner attitude and habits. \\n\\n\r\nArtwork is pretty standard fare coming from Domu, all pastel colors. It all works just fine to promote a warm cozy enviroment. Never any harsh, quick action moving, visuals. There are a few high kicks thrown in for laughs but overall the humor and comedy keeps the visuals from being too much of a distraction. Everything might be in pastel, but everything is accounted for. Laundry hanging on the balcony, to the different ingredients of their snacks and dinners. The enviroment looks very plain but lets not forget this is a story about 3 girls. So everything is usually going to be very clean and organized and you will notice that right away. Literally the only settings that are shown for this show is going to be the girls apartment and the classroom. Each episode will have a different location to keep things fresh but things are usually kept in those two locations. Another nice art twist is how they do the shadowy face and the teardrop mouth. They're good choices to keep the animations a little more unique. \\n\\n\r\nThe strongest part of the show is the comedy and if you know anything about Domu is that this is where they shine the best. No matter what setting they have, just as long as they have girls in the story they can make the funniest situations out of NOTHING. They can make drinking a bottle of water or sitting a table hilarious. And thats what most people will love about this show. Theres no story (comon its a sitcom) don't bother trying to find one. They tell at the start of every episode there is no story, just funny situations. There is not enough props for Domu for making some of the best sitcom anime in the industry ^_^ Whats so great about their story telling is that it feels so fresh and more hilarious with every new episode. You can watch any episode and will still be funny to you 10 years from now. \\n\\n\r\nWell I'm sure I've beaten the cookie cutter aspect of the show to a pulp by now but one thing that isnt the same as Ichigo-M is that its not as infected with cuteness as its predecessor. And thats why I will score this higher than Ichigo-M. Me being american, sitcoms will always have a place in my life. Of course sitcom anime isn't for some people. If you don't like sitcoms or too analytical for a sitcom then please dont watch this. If you want to watch funny things unfold for random characters then this show is just for you! Regardless this is another hit made by Doumu.",

            "content": "Story (8/10)\r\nMinami-ke is a slice of life comedy centring on the three Minami sisters (no mention of any other family except a distant relative) and their friends as they go about their lives \u2013 usually with hilarious consequences. Each episode is portrayed in short segments spread throughout, much like azumanga diaoh with each segment having its own theme, but usually fitting round a general episodic storyline. The vast majority of the story takes place at the girls various schools (each sister attends a grade school) and at home, giving a wide scope for hilarity to ensue, with most of the comedy coming from the youngersisters Chiaki and Kana. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough there may not be a storyline moving towards a dramatic ending, as the genre\u2019s nature is, each episode is well written to bring a smile to the face. The way the story is portrayed with the characters and the styling, make this one of the most fun and enjoyable series that you\u2019ll watch \u2013 its just good fun.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Minami-ke is commonly called soft art, whatever they call it, it fits in with the story and the characters brilliantly. The character designs are some of the best I have seen, every aspect of the characters is well animated, and I love the facial animations \u2013 especially the tear drop mouth. The backgrounds are all nicely done, and the schools and Minami home are all animated well.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint with the animation is the tendency to switch styles when the girls are being serious to a more hardened styling. The first time it happens it\u2019s quite a shock, usually involving facial close ups, with additional details added to the eyes and nose detail \u2013 it just seems out of place with the rest of the animation being so soft, and they could probably have had the same effect without resorting to a different animation style. This is a small complaint though and the rest of the artwork is beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nSound. (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP isn\u2019t to my tastes but is lively, happy and catchy, generally a good mood setter for the series, the ED is again lively and if anything catchier than the OP. The voice acting is of a high standard throughout the anime, everything sounding right, from Kana\u2019s relentlessly enthusiastic voice to Chiaki\u2019s slightly deeper (not in a bad way!) dead pan voice work really well with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music involved reminds me of the background music from azumanga diaoh - it sets the pace of the segments where it is used, and is normally timed for comedic effect and adds in that extra little bit of fun to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis show works because of its strong range of characters and supporting characters throughout the series, with most of the supporting characters getting better development than main characters from other animes.\\n\\n\r\nThe Minami sisters work brilliantly well, with Kana\u2019s abundance of energy and lack of common sense being offset by Chiaki\u2019s superior wit and intolerance for idiots. That said it\u2019s up to Haruka to keep the peace, although this is not easy as both siblings vie for Haruka\u2019s affection at every turn. \\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is very strong, with a few strong recurring characters, each of them likeable, my only complaint was about the gender bending Makoto/Mako, while his initial cross dressing was hilarious, the more often \u2018Mako\u2019 turned up the less I liked the character, however this was somewhat offset with the introduction of Touma (not really a gender bender, as had it forced upon her) later in the series, which seemed to give Makoto a counter balance which I felt was needed.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this show such a success is the way the characters combine, and would not have been half as funny if the extensive range of characters were not involved. The continual battle of wits between Chiaki and Kana is brilliant to watch, and the way they both manipulate their friends into their schemes is highly amusing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyability (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the most enjoyable series I have seen, the characters are wonderfully developed and animated and the scripting for the episodes is brilliant \u2013 you\u2019ll get at least on good laugh out of every episode, which is basically what this type of series is about, putting a smile of the viewers face.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nMiname-ke sets a high standard across the board for it portrayal of brilliant characters, fantastic animation and brilliant use of music. Each storyline brings something new, and you never know what to expect except that its going to be hilarious. I had been looking for a while for something that could compete for laughs with azumanga diaoh\u2019s slapstick comedy and in Miname-ke I found it \u2013 in fact its probably the best anime of its type out there at the moment.\\n",

            "content": "Minami-ke is a Slice of Lice, Comedy about the ordinary lives of 3 ordinary sisters. You can&rsquo;t get more ordinary than this, yet the mild mannered comedy is a sure win. \r\nThis short series is a typical slice of life, portraying the usual daily lives of 3 sisters. The story is basically structured by going from one random short story/event to the next with not much liking these events together. There&rsquo;s nothing complex about story as the events are just the usual things we all experience in life: eat, go to school, hang out with friends, study and sleep. The only thing that makes thisslice of life interesting is the comedy side of things. There&rsquo;s quite a lot of light-hearted humour scattered around, with a lot of it being some kind of pun or just making fun typical clich&eacute;s. But the comedy wouldn&rsquo;t be as good, if it weren&rsquo;t for the likable characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe three Minami sisters are the main characters that make the series so enjoyable. First we have Haruka the well-mannered and responsible older sister, Kana the idiotic and eccentric middle sister and finally we have Chiaki the cute, cold-hearted little sister. The way they interact with one another is hilarious and the supporting characters are enjoyable to watch as well (Hosaka).\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance the animation looks as ordinary as the series with no need to flesh it out, on parodies and such. The change in their facial expressions adds to the hilarity of the series and overall it is also fairly fluid. The music is okay for this slice of life but it doesn&rsquo;t add or take away anything from the viewing experience, as it feels more like a neutral element.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Minami-ke is a great light-hearted comedy, showing the ordinary lives of ordinary girls however the level of comedy can seem pretty stale for some but the rest of us will enjoy it. I particularly enjoyed the &ldquo;Sensei and Ninomiya-kun&rdquo; moments that randomly popped up throughout the series. So if you tired of watching the same old shounen anime or just want more of the same thing from other similar comedies, then this is worth checking out. \\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "I just recently finished watching Minami-ke, and now, among other watchers, I'm sure, waiting to see the second series because I just enjoyed it that much.\r\nMinami-ke's story is simple: 3 sisters living on their own living their daily lives. The pacing is slow, but since the genre is slice-of-life, it doesn't need to go any faster. No romance can be found here (though there are the slight moments of infatuation and sexual references). \r\nEach episode had something about it that usually would make one laugh out loud. There is just something about the girls' personalities and their relationship with one another that makes it sofunny- especially with Kana and Chiaki.\\n\\n\r\nI loved all the characters, personal favorite being Kana, the densest of this sisters and also the craziest. Chiaki, the youngest sister, doesn't take crap from anybody, yet she shows a gentle side around her older sister at times. The older sister is Haruka, the domestic sister who plays the role of the mother (where are the parents, anyway?!). All the characters are so silly and likeable- including every supporting one as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending theme work well; I  liked the upbeat and wacky feeling to the opening theme. I also really liked the music in the background, each track fit in with what was going on with the scene. The voice actors were perfect- especially with Chiaki, deadpan, arrogant, and with a no-nonsense tone.\\n\\n\r\nTo the bored, to the comedic anime-deprived, to anyone at all, Minami-ke is a perfect choice to brighten a day with its antics.",

            "content": "When I first heard about this \"comedy/slice of life\" anime, it seems like all I ever heard was how much this title is like another anime called Ichigo Mashimaro. I have to say that they were indeed right, it is a lot like it! In fact just watching this anime, feels more along the lines of an actual \"anime sitcom.\"\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nSince this is a \"slice of life\" anime it has to be rated on its episode by episode plots. Her we find ourselves partaking in the daily lives of the three Minami sisters, who live alone in an apartment. The story will range from oneof the supporting male members trying to confess their love for one of them, to the girls having problematic trouble at school. One odd thing that caught my eye was the fact that more than 80% of the actual anime takes place either in the three sister\u2019s living room, or at school. One important aspect that this title makes sure to do with its story, is keeping the audience entertained. This is especially true with \"the slice of life genera.\" And I am happy to say that Minami-ke does it very well. The situations that occur can be down right funny at times. Kana is probably the funniest of the anime, she is so random and says things that might fly over the viewer\u2019s head, its the kind of humor that is intentionally not suppose to make sense though. (especially since her sisters don\u2019t get half of them either) Now its not all left up to this one character to keep the episodes funny, as Miname-ke is also complimented with a very funny supporting cast. One of the best ones is a guy named \"Makoto, \" he is not welcomed into the sisters apartment, (one of them isn\u2019t too fond of him for her own reasons) so he decides to dress up as a girl in order to visit them when he wants to, which many female jokes are played off of. I can\u2019t say that all the episodes are winners, as some were definitely better than others, but it overall came together. Unsurprisingly there isn\u2019t any real end to this season, (there are two others, one of which will air next year) as you could pretty much place the final episode anywhere in the count and it wouldn\u2019t matter.\\n\\n\r\nMiname-ke doesn\u2019t push any envelopes with its content, but does include some \"female style jokes\" that may raise an eyebrow with children, nothing over a PG rating though.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork: 8/10\\n\r\nIts pretty good, it certainly won\u2019t win any awards in the art department, as its suppose to come off more as a soft style anime, and that is how it can be best described as...\"soft art.\" For some reason the characters mouths seemed to stand out for me, because of their more triangular shapes, they almost would remind me of rabbits...or perhaps fish. (maybe its just my own imagination) One thing I found to be kind of creepy, was when ever on of the sisters would get into a more serious mood, they drew them like evil eyed adults. Not sure why they did this, it seemed a bit out of place and unnecessary, and felt a tad over used in the end.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 7/10\\n\r\nBoth closing and opening themes are port-raid in a happy up beat song, it kind of makes you feel like you can do anything once you watch them both. (kind of gun-ho style of songs) The background music is pretty sparse as expected, many scenes occur with no tracks at all, trying again to appeal to a more relaxed feel. When it does play some it comes in the form of a soft \"piano style\" melody, I really liked it! The best part though is the character voices, all of them fit well with one another and I couldn\u2019t find one out of place with the character.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nIn any slice of life anime the characters are a crucial part of the series, you can\u2019t enjoy it unless you like them. Thankfully these three sisters each have their own likable personalities; which range from out going (Kana), to very discrete (Chiaki), to some where in the middle. (Haruka the eldest) Some people may be turned off some what by Kana, since she tends to like doing things her own way, and does seem to interfere with situations at time, but nothing major. The only real bad thing I can think of regarding the characters, is that since this is a comedy title-- many of them (the supporting cast) tend to act like one another, and some of them we never really get to know who they are. To help with this though, the more unique supporting characters do get pretty good spotlight time, as the anime will tend to shift to their situations at times. Which was nice, and won\u2019t make you feel like you\u2019re just watching the three sisters all the time.\\n\\n\r\nBottom Line: 8/10\\n\r\nMinami-ke is a nice title if you\u2019re in the mood for a more realistic sense of humor. The characters aren\u2019t particularly deep, but the humor in this is what makes the anime a winner! The three sisters are a likable and funny bunch, and should capture your hearts when it's over. It's by no means a perfect anime, but regardless...this is still one \"slice of life\" anime, that is worth sampling a piece of.",

I do have a broad taste in humor an also often laugh about things most people wouldn't even take as a joke - in short - i don't hesistate when there's something remotely funny. But in this show the only real funny thing was the running gag about the drama tv show the three sisters are following. \"sensei!\" ... \"ninomya-kun!\" ... \"sensei!\"\r\nThat got me giggle every now andthen, but the rest was plain mediocre. At some point i was hoping that they would turn it into a love triangle rom-com. Then at least something interesting would be going on. \\n\\n\r\nBut, i don't wanna bash this show. In all fairness they at least apologize before each episode so i can't be too hard on them. It was alright, but do take the intro sentence seriously! They mean it.

            "content": "Honestly speaking,Minami-ke is my first slice-of-life anime to be watched.Since my very first viewing in 2013,I have reviewed it for at least 20 times and actually fell in love with those types.Much Obliged to Minami-ke for providing me a gate to such a realistic but also marvelous new world :) \r\nStory(9/10)\r\nThe story itself ,centering around the daily life of the three Minami sisters and their acquaintances,is so simplistic that even leaves few and far between trails of exaggeration commonly used in many other slice-of-life animes.Therefore,I might ask you \u201cdon\u2019t expect too much from it\u201d(confession time,I plagiarize the phrase from the Chiaki\u2019s ).But,owing to the seeminglyplain storytelling gimmick ,it is successfully crafted more than a mediocre comedy \u2014 in other words, not only does it manage to avoid being a dull and daily live broadcast,but also succeed in striking more responsive chords in your heart in that you would be definitely confounded by the very down-to-earth scenes,perhaps some of which you already went through in an identical or similar way.\\n\\n\r\nBesides,I might mention that the show-within-a-show Sensei To Ninomiya Kun, to which translated the teacher and his student Niomiya ,is so nonsensical and anti-climatic but funny enough that you shouldn\u2019t miss it .\\n\\n\r\nArt\uff088/10)\\n\r\nIn the first place\uff0cits palette characteristic of pastel shade disposes you refreshing and agreeable towards that series,and creates a gentle tone actually fitting the motif of a slice-of-life comedy .In the second place,the design of the shape of mouth is just like a water-drop ,hence an excessively cute impression is made and I like this superb idea of designing so much. And a pair of stretched arms accompanying the water-drop\u2019s shaped mouth is surely more preferable.\\n\\n\r\nThere might be some flaws from your own palate,and I do agree  that\u201c the tendency to switch styles when the girls are being serious to a more hardened styling...it just seems out of place with the rest of the animation being so soft,...\u201d,opined the user GeneralCox.But for some others such as my sister ,it might be observed as an amusing comparison and spice added to the soft art.It is reminiscent of another famously slice-of-life anime Nichijou\uff0cbearing an abundance of  the utilization of comparsion in facial expression as well.However,from my point of view,Nichijou applies it much better.Nevertheless, the few flaws,probably subjective to some extent, are not totally important in effect.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe background music,surely excluded the role music for Hosaka(Gracious!Mentioning the name is immediately reminiscent of his wacky and insane laughter,\u201dahaha,ahaha,ahahaha\u201d) ,is dolce and makes you revel in its storyline .Besides,both the opening and ending theme is catchy, chirpy and funny with the concomitant shots of the main trio\u2019s and their friend\u2019s daily life , though I slightly prefer the latter to the former owing to its nice soothing tone,particularly with the emergence of the scene depicting the three Minami sisters looking up at the ether.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis show crafts a wide range of diverse characters,from the main ones to the supporting part,whereas none of whom would make you feel redundant.You will soon grow fond of the mischievous and carefree girl Kana with a pedal-to-the-metal outlook,the deadpan Chiaki always with a pair of drowsy eyes ,and the sublime beauty Haruka sort of the Yamato Nadeshiko(\u5927\u548c\u64ab\u5b50), denoting the ideal type of womanhood in Japan yet not actually the same as the ACGN\u2019s one always bound up with sister-con.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the supporting characters are also absolutely impressive and individual as the main ones ,I am not going to spout and rave about how joyous they have brought me and how successful while put them all in combination with the three Minami sisters ,considering many great answers already been submitted.But I might add that the personality shaping itself of each character is detailed and fantastic enough as well,that is to say,it never means to be transferred into an one-fold process, albeit under the idea of simplistic crafting.And that\u2019s why we can catch glimpses of the dreadful stares or menacing gestures coming from the supposedly serene Haruka,while Hosaka is a genuine versatile bloke with the ability of doing everything with great dexterity in spite of his somewhat disgusting behaviour.Also,you might think it\u2019s hard to believe Kana isn\u2019t an idiot until you witnessed her some cunning behaviour such as trying to transform the little boy Makoto into a loli \"Mako-chan\",or Fujioka Kun isn\u2019t no more than a brooding\u201cBanchou\u201d,pending some sweet scenes to be seen,for example, he dressed like a Santa Claus so as to send Chiaki a toy of grizzly bear as gift in Christmas Eve .Likewise,Chiaki not always pose a jaded face especially concerning the interactions with her most admired sister Haruka,whereas Touma\u2019s great talent for weaving makes you wonder if Minami Touma a real tomboy?All the remaining supporting characters are similarly well-done within mere 13 episodes, though this review is confirmed to lapse into a tedious harangue had I incessantly enumerated the diverse aspects in each character.However,you will never have a chance of finding out the subtle workmanship of characters striking a discordant note with the simplistic storyline and slice-of-life settings.\\n\r\nMeanwhile ,homage should be paid to the seiyuus of this series,good job.It would be impossible for the anime to immaculately come across without seiyuus\u2019 enthusiastic and technical voice acting ,especially when it comes to display its characters\u2019 respective likeable features with their individually quirky foibles.Not to mention the fantastic fusion while all the characters come into interactions with each other.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(9/10):\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps most of us were initially more intrigued by a fictional world full of fantasy,plots,magic,moe elements,hot-blooded actions,love affairs,or so on,due to our yearning for an idealistic and disparate world. But later we might seek to find something more realistic for the sake of procuring more resonances in a more similar world,and probably that is one of the reasons why slice-of-life anime can be so widespread.As many MAL users have already pointed out that this Minami-ke series is so realistic that makes you think that either the main or supporting characters are real persons in reality,its delicate shaping of personality still makes you feel it\u2019s a totally light-hearted comedy rather than a gritty reality documentary.Therefore,it seems that Minami-ke is an authentic warm place existing in somewhere,maybe your house or your heart,while its door always open to welcome you after hours of hard toil from workplace. The Minami sisters and their friends are so hospitable\uff0cas if your really existing besties you can confide in.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(9/10)\\n\\n\r\nBased on the aforementioned discussed, I gave an overall rate 9.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for your feedback.",

The characters are wonderful; it's not one of those comedies that feels like random gags, but slice-of-life where the humor is more integrated in day-to-day happenings (even though there isn't much in the way of story progression).\r\nThe artwork is very well done, but it's made for the humor, not necessarily to be pretty.  Especially Kana's expressions crack me up.  And her \"I AM BOSS\" t-shirt makes me laugh every time I think about it.  Actually pretty much everything about Kana cracks me up.  The voiceacting is also excellent, and really strengthens the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIt seemed really awkward that they'd change animation styles when the animators were trying to poke fun at the characters being serious, but instead of becoming less detailed in animation (like normal humor), it became more detailed.  Sometimes it was funny, but usually it was just weird.",

            "content": "Going into this show, I had no real expectations for it. From the get go, Minami-ke looked like your typical slice of life/comedy anime. However, after watching all 13 episodes in one sitting, I realized something. I realized that Minami-ke does what many other similar titles don't; and that is having characters that aren't one dimensional or are there just to fulfill a trope or stereotype.\r\nMinami-ke is about the life of three sisters, Chiaki, Kana and Haruka, and their daily activities as they grow up. Chiaki is the youngest of the three sisters, being in elementary school. Despite being the youngest of the three, shehas surprisingly high intelligence, which she uses to her advantage to make fun of or tease Kana.\\n\\n\r\nKana, being the middle sister, is a rather lazy and noisy girl who prefers doing as little work as possible. Kana loves food, but she is a terrible cook so she relies on her sisters to do the cooking.\\n\\n\r\nHaruka is the eldest of the three sisters, and arguably the most mature. She acts like a mother for Kana and Chiaki, since their parents are overseas. When she is by herself, she becomes unbelievably lazy, even more so than Kana.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Minami-ke work so well is the combination of a charming cast of characters and a laid back atmosphere. The show is rather slow paced, which might be a negative for some people, but in my opinion it adds to the overall nature of the show. There are times where a scene drags on for just a little bit too long and you get bored, but in general there are enough different things happening throughout each episode to keep you interested.\\n\\n\r\nMinami-ke's art is simple, yet effective for setting the mood. I will say that the character designs do change between seasons, but since this is a review for the first season, I won't go into detail about it.\\n\\n\r\n-Pros-\\n\\n\r\n- Likeable cast of characters\\n\r\n- Art style fits this kind of show\\n\r\n- Interesting character interactions\\n\r\n- Very funny and engaging\\n\\n\r\n-Cons-\\n\\n\r\n- A bit too slow paced at times\\n\r\n- As per usual in comedies, some people may not find the jokes funny\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Minami-ke is a must-watch if you're into comedy/slice of life anime. It is very engaging, and I enjoyed almost every minute of it.",

It's not your everyday-wacky-ultra-exaggerated comedy anime, This is a good example of comedy anime honestly.\r\nSelling Point(s):\r\nCharacter's charm,  Light but yet silly enough hillarious moments, nice directing for the pace of the anime\r\nReason Of Liking the anime:\r\nThis anime almost killed me. From start to the end, i was forced to laugh out loud, even i 've tried as hard as possible not to. Mysteriously, with the 3 sisters , Haruka (gentle and kind), Kana (silly + idiotic) , and Chiaki (Moe(?) + arrogant), they have formed such great chemical mixture of charm, which cant stop the people from loving them. Ifyou think those 3 sisters are enough, you better off check out the side characters .. though you might end out having stroke for laughing too much.\\n\\n\r\nThe story - well, pretty much common slice of life, but with the nice directing skill applied to anime, every momments is the classic, packed with  tons of light humor. What's great is  that, this anime  doesn't even need to be shoved in fan services just to make a fan laugh!  A definitely a must watch for those who look for true comedy genre anime.\\n\\n\r\na 10 for this classic comedy anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I Dislike:\\n\r\nNone\\n\\n\r\nAdvice(s):\\n\r\n1) For all ages, a must watch if you want to laugh your misery away.\\n\r\n2) Beware of traps.\\n\r\n3) No, you don't have to join a volleyball club.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Judging from the intro, I assumed this was going to be a pretty bland slice of life anime. The characters seemed okay, the plot was basic, but then I found a whole new level of enjoyment within the characters themselves as soon as I heard them talk.\r\nRight off the bat, we are given an anime where we have a smartass elementary girl whom still has lots of innocence, a bratty, yet surprisingly intelligent at times, middle schooler and a somewhat slutty in a few areas, yet very responsible high school girl; and the experiences they each deliver are cutting edge comedy.\r\nIt has been forever sinceI have seen a slice of life that is as enjoyable as Minami-ke. Every character they introduce is lovable or at least unforgettable in some way. The plot is not too thick, but the comedy is much more! Its delivery of jokes never fail to amuse me, the scenery of their apartment and schools are very bright, colorful and detailed and lastly, even if you do not like slice of life comedies, you would still feel above neutral when watching this one. That is, unless you have an idiosyncrasy for tsundere characters, which one of the characters does and does not fit into due to the confusing nature of her personality.\\n\\n\r\nIn most of my recent anime reviews, I have normally had a nitpicking about the negative part right after this as most have not given me much to remember, but I actually have none for this one. It does well on what it delivers and you would only be offended if you were expecting something else. But, the very essence of this anime is pure comedy and God foreboded no serious elements to ever befall it.\\n\\n\r\nI would go on about the characters, but I have made this review to be in a way where you can only see the good in this anime without knowing everything that there is to come of it yet. If you want full enjoyment out of this anime, you must figure out the characters on your own, but as I said before, you will barely find a moment where you will be bored of this anime. It is very energetic; and yet, it can also be very calming at the same time sometimes due to the genre it is in. I can not recommend it enough as it renewed my faith in anime comedies after finding so many lackluster ones over the past several months, with a few notable exceptions here and there.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you haven't already, give it a chance. If you have, give it ANOTHER chance. Perhaps, you judged it too soon and quit watching. I did this once with a different comedy and when I came back to it, I regretted not watching it sooner.",

The girls only have each other to depend on and help each other get through everything from love confessions to cooking.\r\nAnimation:\r\nThe animation may have been a little bit rough, but its high colors and smooth movements kept these points up! The facial expression of each girl where positively great, the use of going from detailed expressions to the simple lines was hilarious. The backgrounds were OK, nothing to really brandish about, and the background characters where OK as well, to the point where they all did lookthe same. Not like in Soul Eater... 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nOpening Theme:\\n\r\nKeikenchi Joshochu\u2606 by Uran\\n\\n\r\nEnding Theme:\\n\r\nColorful DAYS by Uran\\n\\n\r\nI really liked this OST, one because it was so simple, and added to the comedy in the show. Without it, some parts of the show would be really boring and unfunny. The opening and ending songs, of course sung by the girls, were so upbeat and matched the show perfectly. Also, this is my first time mentioning it, but the actors where perfect. Giving these girls and guys any other actors would have made such a smaller impact than the originals. Great work seiyuus! :D 10/10\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nTake three girls, sisters to be exact, and see their every days lives. The comedy. OH the comedy. As others have said, this show is a a story about... Nothing. There is no real plot line, seeing as it was based off 4koma. (4 paneled comics) There isn't supposed to be a plot. If there really where a plot, the show would not have been as funny. You could compare it to Ichigo Mashimaro. I mean, Minami-Ke is almost exactly like it. But I liked Minami-Ke a lot more. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters make this show what it is. Literally. There's the Minami sister. Chiaki (the old man shoved inside a 10 year old's body), Kana (Someone seriously give her Ritalin)and Haruka (The good housewife). The story revolves around them, and shows what sisters REALLY act like. They were so different, and so sister like. Believe me, I know. I have a sister Kana's age. Then you get to their schools. This is where the good characters come in. There's Makoto (In Chiaki's class) With his absolutely adorableness and love for cross dressing, he became my favorite character. His cuteness is over powering. Then theirs Akira and Fujioka (In Kana's class). Akira is a dork who lives next door to Kana, who wants a girlfriend with long hair. Fujioka has a huge crush on Kana, and is jealous over the time she is spending with Akira. Although, Kana doesn't notice Fujioka's feelings and sees him as a threat/gang leader instead. Then... And then there is Hosaka. I really do NOT know how to describe this guy. Seriously. Just watch the show. You'll understand afterwards. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nValue/Enjoyment:\\n\r\nIf you are depressed and need a great pick me up, watch this. You will forget you were even depressed, that's how much this show will have you smiling. 10/10",

Each and every episode had at least one thing you could laugh about. The dynamic between the sisters almost feels natural messing with each other getting revenge and then coming to a sweet resolution. \r\nI like the youngest character the best she's smart and snippy always messing with the middle sister.\r\nThe middles sister I like the least she does things that can be so annoying and make me want to physically hit her, but that also shows howinvested you can get with the characters. They feel so real that you want to interact with them.\\n\\n\r\nI also really like how they integrate other character so flawlessly it's not forced or awkward.  Bancho!",

            "content": "Minami-Ke is a bit of an oddball show, even for the slice-of-life genre. The character designs are more realistic than the far more popular Azumanga Daioh and Lucky Star (and it took be a bit to get used to the whole tear shaped mouth thing), and the plot is somewhat sporatic, bouncing form episodic to continuity at random (all animes do this, of course, but in the same episode?). These aren't complaints, however, just the facts. Really I can't think of anything bad to say about the series except that the pacing's a bit slow at first. Stick with it, though, and a taste forMinami-Ke's unique style should develop. The characters manage to define themselves in the viewer's mind, even when they go several episodes without reappearing. The reaccuring elements are delightful, as are the more singular stories told (the later experiences several peaks, but hardly any lows from what I recall). Despite the potential for such, fanservice plays a very small part in the show, appearing here and there, but never making its presence known until the last couple of episodes. The whole thing is over before you know it, but fortunately, the show makes it clear that a second season is on the way. While this is a show that requires a bit of a gear sift to get into, the overall effort one makes is totally worth the end result, as Minami-Ke is probably one of the best anime of its kind.",

            "content": "Review from Zagrom, Otaku-Unlimited.net\r\nThis is a slice of life, comedy series based around the life of three sisters.\r\nMinami Haruka, the eldest sister, the sweet and motherly sister.  She is also the most reliable of the three sisters but is lazy when left alone. Although the oldest she is still a second year of high school. And in junior high through several misunderstandings obtained the nickname Banch\u014d (or badass, used to refer to a leader of delinquents, etc, etc)\r\nMinami Kana (my favorite) the family retard, or baka if I may. The middle sister, second year junior high. The type of girl that nearly always actsbefore thinking, does poorly in school (she misreads kanji a lot) she tends to find excuses to make things more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nMinami Chiaki, they youngest sister in elementary (I estimate 5th year, perhaps sixth?) She is made out to be highly intelligent by her friends but it seems that she thinks of things in a rather simple way. She things VERY highly of Haruka and is very formal with her, but uses the term bakayar\u014d (a more strict form of baka) with Kana often.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes: 13\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nI cant really explain much being a slice of life series, there is no real plot. There are plenty of \"love triangles\" but I use that term losely as really there is no proper shape to give it, the love goes all over the place and really does keep things about as funny as it gets. All in all the story all fits together, is easy to get, and is overall funny, A+\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nGreat job on this, alto only 13 episodes you seem to get plenty of time to see almost all the characters grow and change in the series and really get to get a hold of there personality's, and all of them have there on style and stories, no copy paste at all.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\r\nLiked all the back ground music, and OP and ED, not mush else to say, I watched every OP (normally just do it on first and last episode) Love that OP song  ^^\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nArt was clean and interesting, there were really two styles, which is sort of hard to explain unless you watch it, there is the main style (like the image above) and a more serious one that comes up from time to time, mostly between the three Minami sisters when they become more serious between one another, whicch I found weird the first few times but it became normal and then sorta grew on me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nHas become me second favorite series behind Lucky Star with ease, that should say enough (for me anyway). Highly recommended and one with a high rewatching value in my opinion, also note it has a second season Minami-ke Okawari\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Note that this was my first MAL review, hope you enjoyed)",

            "content": "Minami-ke isn't just another slice-of-life comedy that revolves around some main characters. Well, it does do that, but there is a mystical energy that comes from it that makes it not only funny, but pretty addictive to watch.\r\nThe whole story revolves around 3 sisters who have distinct personalities. There's Haruka, the eldest who is the most responsible of the three. She maintains the household, manages their bills, cooks the food and keeps everything in order in the house. There's Kana, the middle sister who has an energy that can't be beat. Although she's lazy and very gullible by her younger sister, she still shows hercreativity in some of her plans in the series. And finally there's Chiaki, the youngest who is the straight man who has the most negative attitude towards Kana and yet is kindest towards Haruka. Chiaki loves to mess with Kana as to misinterpret her love letters from a classmate of Kana's and keeps calling her dumbass. But it drives the story onwards.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, there practically isn't a story here. It is practically a Seinfeld of anime. There are many scenes in their home, scenes in their school and just daily observations and creative ideas that are bounced around in each episode. What makes it stand out is during some scenes, the attitude in the moment changes to a more serious attitude with a widescreen look and a more detailed view of each of the sister's faces. Funny at certain times, but can get kind of annoying at some moments. \\n\\n\r\nThe content in this anime is pretty unique. Some of the episodes have them not doing anything and just hanging out around in their house where Kana and Chiaki are watching a funny soap opera titled &quot;Sensei and Ninomiya-kun&quot; where those words are all that they say. The elements of comedy in it are pretty original as well as some subjects could possibly be what bored girls could be talking about if they were to get together and talk about random stuff.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this was very enjoyable. I laughed a lot, quoted a lot of scenes with my friends and made me think a little at some points. Minami-ke has an addictive quality that made me impatient for the next episode. If you liked Azumanga Daioh and the like, you'll like Minami-ke.",

            "content": "I give this show an overall score of 5/10. I will recommend it to anyone who is bored and wants to relax to something moderate, lighthearted, and funny.\r\nI laughed out loud a couple of times, and find myself smiling stupidly many times throughout the show. It is a silly, carefree, relaxing, and amusing sequence of both ordinary and odd moments shared between three very different sisters. So why the 5/10?\r\n\"Mediocre\" is the best way to describe it.  It does not mean it is \"bad\". It just means that it is \"average\". This anime is not particularly special or even interesting. But I really enjoyedit (I rated it 8/10 in that regard), because I can certainly appreciate the mild nature of slice-of-life.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4/10, Decent\\n\r\nThere is not really a \"story\" as much as there are \"stories\". I categorize slice-of-life shows into two sides: one with an objective, the other without. Minami-ke does not have an objective. It is merely comedy presented in a series of often unusual (but amusing nonetheless) situations shared between the three sisters and/or their classmates. The setting is basically exclusively limited to the Minami residence and their respective schools. There will be references that the show makes over the course of thirteen episodes (for example, the news broadcasted \"loincloth festival\" and television drama \"Sensei to Ninomiya-kun\" makes several appearances throughout the series) which can be rather comical if the audience watches every episode. Additionally, there is some character development throughout the show as well, such as the introduction of Chiaki's \"younger brother\" Touma, and her classmate Makoto's crossdressing schemes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10, Good\\n\r\nSpeaking of character development, I have given it a score above \"mediocre\" because of the variation. Surely, an anime is not without its predictable, archetypal characters lined up, but Minami-ke is a little unique in its approach to the relationship between the Minami sisters and their classmates. The Minami sisters can be characterized as three siblings with jarring dissimilarities: Haruka is the eldest and the most mature and caring, Kana is the middle child with a hyperactive temperament and unrelenting stubbornness (and stupidity), and Chiaki is the youngest sister with principled self-assurance and somewhat monotonous  personality, although she has been shown to be very fond and appreciative of Haruka.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, it is because of this disparity that hilarity often ensues. Add even more contrasting and paradoxical characters from their schools and you have a wonderfully incompatible cast. \\n\\n\r\nSound/Art: 7/10, Good\\n\r\nI give both sound and art a 7/10 because the two are consistent and conveys the action, emotion, and situational atmosphere very well. Considering the fact that this show is ten years old (well, very close to ten years old) at the time of writing this review, the art holds up incredibly well, and the sound (background music and voice acting) remains consistent and on-par with the art. The animation is not always fluid or even detailed, however, there is a slight nostalgic charm to it which may have likely not been the case had I watched this in 2007. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10, Very Good\\n\r\nAs mentioned, enjoyed this show very much. I finished it in two days. Yes, I was bored. Yes, I had \"better\" things to do. But I laughed quite a bit, and on a somewhat personal note, I have not been laughing very often lately. This really cheered me up, and I find all the characters rather likable. Nothing in this show bothered me, or made me frustrated enough to feel as if I should stop watching. Cheesy moments made their appearance every so often, but so did heartwarming ones. I really liked it.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict? 5/10. Do not think of this as \"50%\" It really just means that on a scale of absolutely-terrible-and-unworthy-of-viewing to amazingly-mind-blowing-and-revolutionary, it sits comfortably in the happy medium. And once again,  I recommend this.",

            "content": "Minami-ke is easily describable in American society, sitcom. Short for situational comedy, Minami-ke has no point or plot, but is simply the everyday antics of three sisters, Chiaki, Kana, and Haruka, who are in elementary, junior high, and high school respectively. A good point made by the writers is that they space out the ages of the sisters, so you see a lot of funny points made that one sister would know because they're older, but the other one or two don't. If you enjoyed this series, then you'll know quite well what episode included what weird things a boy and a girl do whenthey're alone.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nBeing what is commonly called a sitcom, there is no main plot. No one is trying to find their reason for existence or trying to romance another character. Although there is plenty of the latter, it isn't really significant to the story other than providing good comedy material. Other than that, all episodes have a main point, that is, they have one thing that its about, but it doesn't span the whole series. One episode they'll be talking about love and the next, food or celebration.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI watched the series as subbed by Ayako fansubs, and they tend to mess around a lot in their work. As such, in one episode, they mention that there is a use of Bible Black faces... although I know what they mean (characters will enter a state of &quot;high-definition,&quot; lots of detail on the face (especially in the eyes) and plenty of shadow use to create a &quot;dark&quot; feeling), I don't exactly applaud their use of H-anime as a reference. Outside that, I've never seen the &quot;teardrop mouth&quot; used ever before, and it has been quite a while since I've ever seen an ahoge of that style. For reference, Chiaki has an ahoge, a little pouf of hair on her head, although more commonly today is the hair antennae. They're the same, but I haven't seen a lock of hair more than I've seen a strand or whatever you might call it. Other than that, the coloring is soft and &quot;pastel-y,&quot; not really as detailed or mood colored as other anime, but since it's a comedy of three girls, the idea goes well. The characters all have a charm to them, perhaps due to the teardrop mouth.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe music is fun in this series; and a little joy in the music reinforces the surroundings of the scene, and so works quite well. The OP and ED are also fun, it's more comedy centralized than the sequel.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe three sisters aren't too uncommon in culture today, although their combination in one family may be a bit unlikely. Chiaki is the quiet, young, conservative, intelligent, and rather harsh sister, who loves and helps Haruka but beats up on Kana. Her trademark name for Kana is repeated constantly throughout the series. Kana is the middle child, wild, lazy, carefree, unaware, and a bit demanding. She eats constantly, is always a bit dumb, and does nothing to help out the family. Whenever she does chores, it tends to make more work instead of finishing it. Her cooking is no exception... And to balance out the two, who always fight, there's Haruka. The older, wiser, and accomplished sister is always doing the work to support the two younger sisters, cooking, doing laundry, and paying the bills. She's a bit of a workaholic; without work she just lazes around, lethargic. She's also a bit carefree, as some may recognize as a bit of fanservice in the series. There's plenty more, with lots of other problems... but you'll have to see for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nRandom humor, well put and well timed helps the entire series. A series of pointless endeavors in life with funny situations and completely nonsense occurrences help reinforce that. It's as funny as they come, and being more modern, it feels like Azumanga Daioh!, a similar series with instead female students. Nonetheless, the pointlessness doesn't lose any of the cohesion in the series, so this is quite enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAnime sitcoms are so much funnier than realistic sitcoms for one main reason. Reality sitcoms are limited by world limits. In the anime world, there is no possible end to the humor, so it is as funny as it gets. A short series with a sequel, this is fun to watch and fun to remember.",

Don't expect too much.\r\nStory: There isn't really much of a plot to this. It's about three sister that have very different personalities and what they go through in school, at home, with guys, things of that nature. It's the very definition of slice of life. You really shouldn't go into this anme expecting anything more than comedy. There's not much in the terms of drama, romance, or anything of that sort.\r\nArt: The animation quality is by far not top notch. I mean, its not utterlyunbearable. The character designs match perfectly with their personality. The problem is that there's not enough detail in the backgrounds, but since it's just an anime for laughs, it doesn't really matter too much.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening and ending fit perfectly with the series. Very catchy and leading into what you are about to watch. The voices sound exatly like their personalities show it should. Kana's voice is very sarcastic and naive when it comes to tricks. Chiaka's voice is dead-panned just like the comments are suppose to be. And Haruka has the very sweet caring voice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters were quite unique. The sisters are all drastically different from one another, but so are the rest of the characters. Watching them interact is priceless. There's sweet ones, mean ones, brainless ones, perverted ones, love struck ones. They're all different, but they're all strange.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I've never seen an anime like this. I thought a few of the scenes were just pointless, but they were suppose to be because it's jst s pointless its funny, but to me it's not. It's one of the best comedies I've seen. It's entertaining to watch how some simple misunderstandings turn into such outrageous things.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think that if you enjoy comedy anime or anime with no real story to tell, you'll probably like this one.",

            "content": "Title: Minami-ke\r\nGenre: Slice of Life, School Life, Comedy etc.\r\nStory: 7\r\nAlthough it is a light, comedy genre, which I personally like to watch, the story in itself does not seem to continue from the previous episodes even though there are some evident connections in \"Ocean\" episode. Critically just looking at the story line, I personally cannot give more than 7 because the storyline doesn't exist at all (I mean metaphorically)\r\nArt: 10\r\nThe art to me is perfect, one of the styles that I like (pity for me when this changed in the second season). It's soft drawing fits well with the genre and the intention of theAnime, which consequently enhances the quality of the Anime as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nI have to admit that the sound is in fact exceptional, but in some cases it just doesn't seem to quite fit well with the atmosphere. Otherwise, the voice, BGM and the OP and ED fits well with Anime. Specifically talking of OP and ED, it is a enjoyable, fast and light music that goes quite well with characters and the \"storyline\".\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe characters are perfect and the voice acting is just outstanding. The relationship between main and supporting characters adds up to the overall comedy and humour of the Anime, and the voice actors are really focused on the character and carries out their emotions effectively (especially Chiaki whose voices should be just like how Chihara-san has acted on my personal opinion). Good organization with the characters and their coherence is sound.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nAs one of the first Animes I have watched, it is a enjoyable Anime with bits of humours and comedy (although some are just for \"Japanese-apt\" people) and it gets you laugh and laugh all the way to the end, and you will realize that the Anime has actually finished too early. Some points are lost for the \"Japanese only jokes\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10\\n\r\nI would strongly recommend this Anime to anyone who is interested in Slice of life and when you get depressed and all that; watch this and you'll get over it. It is just full of joy and comedy that you can't miss out really. In my view, it is one of the masterpieces of small Anime-production company (It was horrible when the big guys took it over).",

            "content": "Minami-ke is a slice of life comedy, and stars the three sisters Haruka, Kana and Chiaki.\r\nStory\r\nSince this is a slice of life, it&rsquo;s a bit obvious how the story goes. We see the daily lives of the sisters and their friends, with a different focus in each episode. Nothing special happens really. Still I really liked how the story was presented, and many characters were involved in various ways, and lead to a lot of hilarious moments. The writers (probably the mangaka as well) made great use of the huge amount of side-characters, without it feeling unnatural. That&rsquo;s what I loved the most. Each episodewas unique, and about different persons each time. I also had trouble thinking what would happen next, in other words it was a very unpredictable show. And of course, and most importantly, it&rsquo;s funny.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nOverall I&rsquo;d say this show is very good looking. The colours used are great, and the show has a very soft feeling. Character designs are great too. The only thing I didn&rsquo;t like, was that in some shots the characters&rsquo; noses looked a bit weird. They disappeared and it looked ridiculous. Thankfully it didn&rsquo;t happen too often. Otherwise the animation is very consistent, and it maintains the calm atmosphere of the plot in a nice manner.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nGood background music, quite good opening and ending, sound effects in place, and good voicing. What else is there to say?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe three main characters, the sisters, are just great. They compliment each other in a really nice way, and they are hilarious. That aside, what I think is the best about this show, are all the supporting characters. There are so many, each of them unique, and they all get enough screen time to shine. The character designers must be geniuses (props to the mangaka as well, for making such great characters). The characters are the best thing about this show, in my opinion (I mean, Hosaka and Mako-chan are remarkable characters, they alone are almost enough to justify a 10 for characters!).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nOf course I enjoyed it, it was funny as hell. The episodes were all enjoyable, and I think I&rsquo;m gonna rewatch this, as my first series. But still Minami-ke lacked something for me to give it top grade in this category.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nAll in all a very funny show, totally unpredictable and one of the better shows of 2007. Just go watch it.\\n\\n\r\nGuess I&rsquo;m gonna watch Okawari soon&hellip;",

            "content": "This is a comedy anime that is \"kind of nonsense, but strangely interesting.\" It's a show similar to Lucky Star. Nothing much is to be expected from it, but it is definitely a MUST WATCH.\r\nBefore every episode starts, it is always stated not to expect too much from it. This show is simply about the Minami-ke sisters and their everyday lives. However, they are not your average, boring sisters so expect a lot of laughter from their thoughts, their actions, and their experiences.\r\nThis show is most creative with their art. The characters are drawn well and so is their environment. It's well animated. The onlyproblem they have here is that they have this really ugly face close-ups when a character is serious. Those specific close-ups destroy the overall beauty.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds are great! Voices, SFX, music, OP, ED, everything is good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is this show's highest point. The show is great because of their personalities and their very funny chemistry. They all fit in well. The only problem here is that there are times when the characters are too harsh or too weird that it's not funny anymore.\\n\\n\r\nThis show gives a high level of enjoyment since its great comedy will be making you laugh frequently. Everything is to be enjoyed from OP till the ED. However, with the stated problems, it doesn't give enjoyment to the max.",

            "content": "Sum it up in three words: Innovative, Cramps, Ninomiya-kun\r\nThis is going to be the first time that I will actually write a proper review, because I think this anime deserves one. Judging from its ranking, it is not so high, but I think this is one of the most under-rate anime today. There are so many people out there who tries to make funny anime, a lot of them are slapstick, and a lot of them are just so annoying because they try to be funny when they are not. (Hayate the Combat Butler for example) When an comedy anime is not funny, it isunforgivable. This doesn't apply to Minami-ke though.\\n\\n\r\nStory: (No rating) This is not really an anime with a storyline, it is, as it says, the daily lives of three sisters. It is not something extra-ordinary, no espers and great big evil plots, it is EASY TO FOLLOW and laidback.\\n\\n\r\nArt: At first I thought it wasn't very good, but as you get used to them, you will really start to like the style. I especially like how they draw the mouth, I think it is very cute! The people who wrote this anime also used DIFFERENT style of drawing at different situations, for example, when they are giving each other &quot;evils&quot; the art suddenly starts to become more mature and real, to make fun of the character's body language. tbh, there are a lot of original comedy that no one else has ever thought of, which is why I recommend it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Well, the opening \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: In an anime that deals mainly in character-development, it does it outstandingly. At first sight, you will instantly fall in love with the contrasting personalities of the characters and you will &quot;yearn&quot; for how they interact. You will learn about new characters but the main focus is on the three sisters. It is ESPECIALLY good that one sister goes to primary school, another secondary and the third - high school. So there are things that the youngest sister don't understand such as she doesn't know what &quot;doing naughty things&quot; mean, while being teased by others. CLASSICAL. That is only to name one of many moments.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: &ldquo;Sensei and Ninomiya-kun&rdquo; &lt;&lt;&lt; when you watch it, just look out for that. EVERY EPISODE, I LAUGHED OUT LOUD SO MANY TIMES. (In three years of watching Anime, I have NEVER laughed at an anime because it was funny, NEVER) Everything the characters do are very spontaneous but yet believable in a real life situation. Everything from cross-dressing to bikinis, you would never have guessed. IT NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE YOU.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - I am not a person who really like comedy anime, I prefer the more deeper, emotional side of anime, so based on my reference, I can only give it a respectable 8. But if you love your comedy, you will definitely love this. (and if you don't prefer the comedy genre, this anime may give you a different outlook but be prepared to get cramps from laughing too much.",

            "content": "I am a pretty big fan of slice of life anime, but not indiscriminate. Minami-ke really grew on me after the first few episodes. My favorite thing about this series ( and the currently airing second season called Minami-ke Okawari) is the chemistry between the sisters ( especially Kana and Chiaki). In fact, these two have become some of my very favorite anime characters ever. Also, contains one of the cutest appearances by a stuffed animal I have ever seen ( Fujioka the Bear).\r\nOf course, as with most slice of life, there is VERY little in regards to a plotline in Minami-ke. Most of theepisodes could probably be watched separately as stand alone comedies. The only &quot;plots&quot; that exist in the series is the story of Fujioka's affection for Kana, Makoto's and Touma's crossdressing, maybe a few other minor details that aren't coming to mind right now.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters and voice acting is what really gets me about Minami-ke. The characters are very lively, with their unique personalities, but aren't unrealistic in the way they behave. The artistic depiction of the characters is also more realistic than many other series ( not as many huge breasts flinging everywhere, or huge shapely hips, or unrealistic hair color, or girls that look underdeveloped/overdeveloped for their age). I think this &quot;realism&quot; is generally why I prefer Minami-ke to Lucky Star. Minami-ke still has a very high kawaii factor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the series is funny, soft, not over-the-top, with great art/voice acting, and doesn't needlessly bombard you with pop-culture references ( if you enjoy these, I'd suggest Lucky Star).",
