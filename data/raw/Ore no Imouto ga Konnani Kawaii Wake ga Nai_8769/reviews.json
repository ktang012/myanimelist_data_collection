            "content": "People can look at this anime anyway they want, but it'll forever be (for me) a sweet story of how an older brother came to love his sister as any older brother should. So far, every episode managed to unfold into how the two get closer to each other as the older brother helps his sister with common teen problems. \r\nThe story is different from other brother-sister relationship anime. Told from the brother's point of view, it's light and has no weird physical and romantic interaction between the two. I like how he started from not even talking to his sister to how he realizesat the end of the day something new or an improvement with his sister. \\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, I like the brother's character a lot. He's sort of ideal as a brother. He acts, responds, reacts and shows his love for his sister naturally as how any boy should. On the other hand, his sister depicts any sibling with a whole lot of pride, asking for help from someone you don't expect to get help from. It's also fun to watch how she turns to her brother for help and learns to appreciate him.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is good and is highly recommended to those who would like to see some family values in a different way.",

            "content": "Every season we seem to get that one show that has all the buzz and word of mouth about it from the anime community.  This time most of that was centered on this anime, Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai.  I will admit that from the first time I saw details of this show pop up I was not to thrilled with its prospects, but the hype over the show was too much to ignore and I decided to give it a go.  In the end I am left wonder just what was all the fuss about?\r\nFrom the startwe are setup with our typical and predictable harem anime plot, a high school guy Kyousuke who is fairly nondescript and normal finds himself involved in his little sister's secret hobby, eroge games and anime.  Since up till now his sister, Kirino, has basically had nothing to do with him so both her secret and her sudden willingness to open up to him is a complete surprise.  Now he finds himself helping Kirino acquire new eroge, hide her hobby from her friends, help her make new friends, and I suppose repair their sibling relationship.  Seriously a pair of siblings find happiness through the power of eroge!  Are you kidding?  Is this a PSA for the eroge industry?\\n\\n\r\nNow I haven\u2019t read any of the light novels so I can\u2019t speak for how well this anime does as an adaptation of them.  Though I can say that if this really is a good adaption then I think I will pass.  It\u2019s not that Ore Imouto is a bad anime either; it\u2019s just really uninteresting.  Watching this show wasn't a chore but I just kept wondering to myself, why isn't this any good?  I can usually see why someone might like or dislike an anime more that I do but with this one I cant for the life of me understand how anyone could think this one is any good.  The lack of any interesting story makes this anime completely character driven and since the characters are so awful it just feels like it doesn't get anywhere nor do you care if it does or doesn't.   Elements of the plot eventually becomes so totally implausible and unrealistic that they defy belief.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall Ore Imouto is an idealistic view of how otaku and anime fans want to be viewed by others.  It clearly panders to the otaku community and those who fancy themselves as wannabe otaku, i.e. weeaboo\u2019s.  They really aren't creepy guys who cuddle with full size oppai body pillows on the train or buy an anime special edition box because they have a pair of blue striped panties inside. They are fashion models, Buddhist monks, and super rich oujosama's!  It\u2019s not that I have anything against otaku mind you, but at the same time I don\u2019t find the lifestyle to be particularly interesting or commendable.  While I do think Ore Imouto tries to deal with some serious issues at times, Kirino's character makes it impossible to really accept them.  On the plus side I will give the anime credit for not caving in completely to the fan base by drowning the show in pervy fan service.\\n\\n\r\nThe main issue overall with the story is there is too little of everything.  There isn\u2019t any story to speak of, though that would probably be ok if it was completely episodic, but it\u2019s not.  We start out with Kirino's hobby being laid out and the drama that unfolds as her best friend and her father find out about it.  Both are coincidentally very anti-anime/eroge.  Though I can\u2019t really blame them really too much for the later, I mean she is in middle school for god's sake and watching/playing those things is technically illegal for her.  Kyousuke stands up for her every time along the way.  It actually sounds kind of inspiring and sweet but it isn\u2019t (more on why later).  \\n\\n\r\nThe romantic elements don\u2019t work either, since we really aren\u2019t given much about each character to think there is even a relationship developing.  There is really no chemistry between any of the characters either.  This is mostly due to Kyousuke's complete and utter lack of anything resembling personality.  The ending is also bad, but not unexpected given the genre and this lack of chemistry.  \\n\\n\r\nThe lead Kyousuke is without a doubt one of the most uninteresting characters I have seen in recent memory.  He seems to exemplify the ordinary lifeless harem lead.  It seems he has absolutely no interests of his own.  A look into his room shows a barren waste that lacks even the most Spartan decor and might as well just be a room at a hotel.  I think his room tells you a lot about him because like him, the only time it contains anything is when it belongs to someone else.  He is like an empty glass, waiting to be filled by whomever he comes into contact with.  I mean sure, he is a really nice guy.  He helps his sister and her friends whenever they need him, every time!  All of this without any thought or expectation of a reward.  However it feels more like he does out of sheer boredom than anything else.  He doesn\u2019t seem to really care one way or the other about anyone, especially his sister.  You get the feeling that he\u2019s helping her out of an obligation as her brother.  Of course why would he like, let alone love her or want to help her for any other reason?  She\u2019s nothing but a complete bitch to him anyway.\\n\\n\r\nKirino is on the surface your standard tsundere archetype.  Visually she\u2019s got everything that makes for otaku wet dreams but under the pretty exterior lays one of ugliest and most unsympathetic characters in anime.  There is a really fine line to walk when doing tsundere characters.  The difference \"tsundere\" and a \"bitch\" is extremely small.  Kirino falls squarely on the side of the bitch.  Her actions are not cute nor are they even funny.  She\u2019s conniving, mean-spirited, selfish, vain, disloyal, and wholly unlikable.  Despite apparently \"loving\" her brother she treats him totally opposite, in true tsundere fashion but unlike most characters in this archetype she never backs down at all from this role.  She uses everyone in the cast for her own selfish wants and then casts them away when she doesn\u2019t need them anymore.  Unable to even stay true to her new otaku friends she shuns them as soon as her \"cool\" personality and friendship with the \u201cin crowd\u201d is threatened.  Additionally she is utterly unbelievable as a character.  We are supposed to believe she is popular, athletic, a professional model, successful novelist, an imouto, AND an otaku?  All before even entering high school?  Right...\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the anime little has changed for either Kirino or Kyousuke.  They haven\u2019t grown at all as characters or as people.  Kyousuke remains an emotionless robotic proxy with no will or dreams of his own and still unable to see all the girls throwing themselves at his corpse of a personality.  If Kirino had become better at expressing her love for her brother and her friends or even learned to embrace her hobby openly without care as to what other people thought, it might have made her character easier to take.\\n\\n\r\nWith lead characters this bad it really makes the supporting characters seem even worse by comparison, or better depending on who you\u2019re talking about.  The downside is everyone with the exception of Kuroneko and to a lesser degree Manami.  Manami is Kyousuke's childhood friend and I suppose defacto girlfriend was a likable character who I actually felt pity for than anything else.  She is poorly developed and mostly ignored by the plot but from a cast that is so poorly conceived she stands as a lone bright spot.  In a better cast and with better leads she is probably lost as just an also-ran character.\\n\\n\r\nKuroneko on the other hand is different.  She is actually a really interesting and well implemented character.  As one of Kirino's new otaku friends she is basically everything that Kirino is not.  She is true to herself and loyal to her friends.  She is responsible and trustworthy and has her priorities in line.  In one episode that shows her taking care of her little sister you can see from her actions that she honestly loves her sibling as she plays with her, puts up with her favorite anime, which she despises but she does so anyway.  Although she is well aware that people and even her family thinks she is weird and abnormal, she doesn\u2019t care and does as she likes.  Because it gives her enjoyment.  In my opinion Kirino doesn\u2019t deserve her as a friend.  Of all the people in this cast the only one I would want to hang out with willingly and be friends with is her.\\n\\n\r\nOre Imouto's visual aspects are top notch however.  The character designs are pleasing to the eye and well proportioned.  The settings and backgrounds are well done though a bit bland in some cases.  Kirino's room is probably the most interesting with the most amount of things lying about.  Some of the visual parodies and references to other anime and games I found were pretty amusing.  Particularly those relating to Fate/Stay Night which appeared several times.   I did enjoy the lack of tits and ass from the production and that went a long way towards making the show far less perverse as I had initially assumed it would be.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast is also strong, featuring Ayana Takeatsu fresh off her success as Azusa from K-ON in the title role.  It\u2019s too bad she wasn\u2019t given a better character to work with, but I think she played the part as well as it could have been.  Other favorites of mine such as Yukari Tamura and Saori Hayami play smaller roles but overall I found all the performances to be very good.  The music is a definite strength as well; ChariS OP \"irony\" is one of the better anime songs of the year.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes down to it Ore Imouto is the kind of disposable anime that comes along every year.  While it got more than its share of hype and press it is unlikely to be remembered in the years to come.  I don\u2019t necessarily think this is a terrible show, it has aspects that I think are terrible but overall I can\u2019t say I hated it either.  It had just enough to keep my interest from week to week and little else.  I suggest you ignore the hype and skip this anime.  If you want to see an anime about otaku that doesn\u2019t pander to them, watch Kuragehime instead.  You can thank me later.\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nI continue on my quest to explore new genres of anime and review really odd stuff. \"Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai\" roughly translates to \"I can't believe my little sister is this cute!\" I will call this title Oreimo for the rest of this review because honestly the full title is WAY too long. Much like one of my all time favorite spoof movies: Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood.\r\nOur main character is an obnoxious teenage male who is upset that his little sister doesn't bring him breakfast in bed and act likethe cutesy little sisters in the anime he likes. The little sister is loud, irritating, and all things stereo-typically \"Tsundere\". One day the elder brother discovers that his little sister is REALLY into lolicon anime and videogames along with incest, and her favorite: Lolicon/incest together. This makes the brother immediately fall in love with his little sister and try grope her while she sleeps. My reaction...WHAT!? I am an elder brother myself and if I suddenly found out my little brother was a passionate member of NAMBLA, my first reaction would NOT be....\"man, I really want to fuck my brother right now!\" Of course, our MC meets his little sister's friends who are also ridiculous otaku stereotypes and it becomes a generic harem anime only with lots of wincest and loli! Hooray! Seriously, FUCK this anime!\\n\\n\r\nSome anime are made \"by Otaku for Otaku\" to the complete exclusion of everyone else. I'm Ok with this. We all have our own likes and dislikes and not every show and movie has to be aimed at everyone. However, this anime absolutely embraces every negative stereotype about otaku and tries to pander to the lowest common denominator. I found this not only bad, but rather insultingly bad. I love anime as a medium of storytelling, but I fucking HATED this show. The parents in this show are \"big meanies\" who don't understand the joys of being an anime geek and try to negatively judge our heroes. However, I don't feel this show does a good job representing anime fans and defending us against those that dislike anime! For example, just because I like to read manga by Naoki Urosawa instead of reading comics by Stan Lee, doesn't mean I: collect hundreds of figurines, live in my parent's basement, buy hundreds of dollars worth of hentai, am a pedophile, am incestuous, or lack any semblance of social skills. Embracing these stereotypes doesn't represent our cause as anime fans or encourage others to give anime a chance! If you want to see a GOOD anime about the anti-otaku stigma in Japan and living the life of a secret otaku, watch the anime \"Welcome to the NHK!\" If OreImo was made as a satire attacking anime fans and encouraging people to NOT watch anime, it would be a crude, low blow but relatively effective. As a PRO-otaku show that acts as if it is the most wonderful, loving tribute to otaku everywhere, this show is a fucking failure!\\n\\n\r\nNow for the question you have all been asking: \"why did this piece of shit get a 2/10 instead of a 1/10?\". The answer is that the comedy in this series is so stupid it's almost funny. It isn't actually funny, but it's almost funny in the way that Tim and Eric the Awesome Show is sort of funny in that oh so popular anti-humor style. This show's relentless awkwardness that it puts the audience through and totally bizarre style of \"humor\" almost reminded me of something Andy Kaufman would do. He was a famous...\"comedian\" well known for stunts like pulling out a copy of The Great Gatsby during a stand up comedy performance and reading it aloud...and just kept going. Eventually this created some nervous laughter from the audience because it was just so awkward and they had no idea how to react...then eventually they got up and left and he just kept on reading aloud. That is basically what this anime is like. At first you sort of chuckle with nervous laughter just because it is so WTF...then eventually you realize that...this is it, this is the whole thing...so you get up and leave. Or you finish the whole series if you are a complete masochist.\\n\\n",

            "content": "'Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai' (Long titles for the win) is one of those animes I just can't figure out. On the surface it appears to be an anime about a brother and a sister who struggle to realise their feelings for each other. But in reality it is about much more than that. We have a good chunk of the story here focused on anime and the world of otakus as well as the friendships that one can gain simply by going outside and meeting new people. \r\nThat said, the plot's main purpose is to of course present us thelife of siblings who, as is often the case, display aggression and hostility towards each other but in reality care deeply for one another. \\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters, Kyosuke and Kirino Kousaka are complete opposites when it comes to their personalities. Kyosuke is a kind and mostly peaceful person who enjoys 'ordinary and average things' - his words. He also happens to be quite possibly the unluckiest person on the planet, often blamed for things he didn't do and accidents he didn't cause. Add to that the fact that he'll do anything for his unappreciative sister and you've got the perfect recipe for a martyr-type character. Indeed the suffering this character will go through in this series is immense. \\n\\n\r\nHis sister, Kirino, is a spoiled brat with a serious attitude problem, completely cold and hostile towards her brother. She's a tsundere without the dere part. She behaves similarly to other people apart from her two closest friends. This character annoyed me to no end and at times I just wanted to drop the series simply because I couldn't listen to her constant complaining and her ways of screwing up her brother's reputation in the eyes of many many people. Ironically however, her tsun( no dere) behaviour perfectly fits in with the plot in this series and without that disgustingly hostile behaviour this anime would not be complete. \\n\\n\r\nWe have a few other supporting characters of course, the tall and mysterious Saori, the intelligent and menacing Kuroneko (real name Ruri Gokou) and perhaps the most relaxing character to grace the screens of anime watchers across the world - Manami. \\n\\n\r\nKuroneko is your typical gothic style anime watcher who mostly spends her days writing novels that even native Japanese-speakers wouldn't be able to read. Her vocabulary is vast and getting in an argument with her is always going to end bad for the challenger. \\n\\n\r\nSaori is... tall. There's not much I can say about her apart from that because this series simply does not giver her enough time. From what we see we can make out that she's quite geeky and she simply enjoys spending time with her friends.\\n\\n\r\nManami is a hard working and kind person - mature beyond her years. Let me put it this way, if I was looking for a life long partner she's the person I would try to get to know better. No wonder then that Kyousuke prefers to spend every free minute he has with her. A lot of characters in this anime see them as a couple and Manami's grandfather is trying every trick in the book to push their relationship to the next level. Hilarious stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is staggering. It's extremely precise and all the lines and curves are perfectly drawn. The characters look beautiful and attention has been paid to every single detail. Likewise the music is spot on and voice acting accurate and authentic. \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment part of this anime is... something I had to think hard about. On one hand if you're into the whole tsundere/martyr thing then go ahead you will enjoy this series, especially since it's very realistic. But if you get easily annoyed by one character complaining about trivial matters over and over and over again every single episode then you will definitely sit there unsatisfied and more than likely, agitated. But if you ignore that one character then this anime becomes a paradise since it also focuses on the daily struggles of otakus. That's what had me thinking the whole time, this is an anime about anime (ANIMESEPUSHION!) and also a lot of other things that go with it. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, despite Kirino's horrendous personality, I enjoyed this series. It is what it is. Don't go into it expecting it to be a masterpiece and don't take it too seriously either and you'll have fun.",

The two siblings treat each other like most do in the real world, with dislike, indifference, hate and of course love.  It has an intriguing plot to begin with and as the story unfolds it actually makes you care about the characters.  \r\n     I found the characters refreshing and liked how they seemed to change as the story advanced.  Most of them seemed to be more well thought out than your usual 2d run of themill stooges.  Having been limited to 15 episodes I thought they did well fleshing them out.   Though a couple could use more depth and emotion. \\n\r\n     The art work was pretty good and was what I kind of of expected in a anime of this type.  The girls looked like girls and not some barbie dolls.  I also like that they didn't revert to using childish miniatures.  The people pretty much seemed like the age they were portraying. \\n\r\n     Overall this is a funny, heartwarming, fun look at a brother and sister who are trying to figure out if they love or hate one another.

            "content": "'Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai! (My Little Sister Can't Possibly be this Adorable!)' is about an ordinary high school student (Kyousuke), who one day discovered his usually rude and rebellious little sister (Kirino) is a closet otaku. One thing leads to another, Kyousuke ends up helping his little sister with many otaku things.\r\nAfter a quick glance at the title and plot synopsis, I thought this was some kind of incest harem comedy, and had an extremely low expectation. However, as the story progressed, a nagging thought began to dwell in my mind: \"This Show Can't Possibly be this Enjoyable!\"\r\nThe story isdriven by Kirino's selfish \"Life Consultations\" about her otaku hobby, getting her brother into all sorts of trouble. I know a lot of people are going to compare this with 'Genshiken' series, but it's quite different. 'Genshiken' focuses on different kinds of otaku, and how the protagonist fit in with fellow otaku around him. On the other hand, 'OreImo' is very much about the otaku culture seen from an average person's view, and depicts how the heroine's hobby is exposed to ordinary friends and adults around her. Most characters around Kirino represent a social group that she must seek acceptance from.\\n\\n\r\nHer brother Kyousuke is open-minded and willing to learn new things for his little sister. Members in this group are quite rare, but accept others quickly.\\n\r\nThe father is an old-fashioned conservative. Fortunately for Kirino, the dad is a reasonable man, and allows her to continue under certain conditions. It can also be said that when society is exposed to something new for a certain time, it eventually becomes a norm and become accepted.\\n\r\nThen comes Ayase, the misinformed. She's the type who believes everything she sees in TV, and forms prejudice in her mind. This type, as demonstrated in the series, can be converted with sufficient counter-evidence.\\n\r\nFinally, we have Kanako, who just despises and disgusted by otaku's creepiness... this type is probably inconvertible, but fortunately she likes to be worshipped, and otaku provide her that.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the fellow otaku friends, Saori, who tries everything but doesn't become particularly attached to anything, and then Kuroneko, who like Kirino is very passionate about a certain genre, and unwilling to budge. These characters broaden Kirino's otaku life by introducing her to new things and opinions.\\n\\n\r\nLike 'Genshiken', the story here does involves a wide range of otaku activities such as anime, eroge, live commentary, comic fest, cosplay, otagei and additionally production of fan novel and anime. I found it interesting that this show has a lot of self-reference with the anime production episode where a lot of ideas such as use of different ED and real stores as anime location, as well as the difficulty in maintaining original plots for anime adaptations. In the eroge episode, it shows the irony of Kirino's attitude toward her brother through an eroge, in which Kirino found a character very similar to her to be very annoying, and subtly realizes her own emotion. In the novel episode, it also touched on how the recent trend of moe and ecchi was degrading anime, but stated that in the end, all art works are subject of personal preferences, and there's no real \"correct\" answer.\\n\\n\r\nOne nagging question throughout the series was \"why would Kyousuke go such lengths to help his sister when she`s acting like such a bitch all the time\", but Kirino eventually became quite adorable because she`s such an earnest girl who gives 100% at everything she does.\\n\r\nKyousuke was a really likable guy who went out and got things done for his little sister, with couple of great quick thinking in critical times. The whole theme of brotherly love was beautifully summarized in the final episode. I have to admit it was sort of corny, but a fitting ending nonetheless. The irony that the one time he wasn't able to make a composed decision was in an argument with his own sister, and the reverse effect actually led to the desired result.\\n\\n\r\nAnother one may be \"why is Kirino so bitchy to her brother when he's doing so much good for her?\" Kirino is what they call \u300c\u30ae\u30e3\u30eb\u300d (Gyaru) in Japan, fashion/trend-conscious girls. One of their major characteristics is that they call their parents and brothers \u300c\u304d\u3082\u3063\u300d (Gross) or \u300c\u3046\u3056\u3063\u300d (Annoying) and avoid them because these girls don't want to be seen as a baby who still clings on to the family, or don't want to be associated with the uncool. Kirino's character is basically stereotypical gyaru who also happens to be a tsundere, therefore the constant abuse of her brother. It was apparent that her behavior was also her clumsy way of expressing her affection and need for attention from her big brother. There's also a Japanese saying \u300c\u55a7\u5629\u3059\u308b\u307b\u3069\u4ef2\u304c\u3044\u3044\u300d \"They get along so well that they fight all the time\", as in two people are so close that they don't need to hold anything back, and you wouldn't get mad at someone you don't care about. One can say the argument and even physical violence in the end was a milestone in the improvement of their relationship, especially compared to beginning of the series when Kirino outright ignored her brother.\\n\\n\r\nJust from Kirino's character setting alone, you can tell this show was never meant to be a realistic portrayal of otaku culture, as gyaru and otaku have long been depicted in media as arch-enemies of incompatible personalities.\\n\r\nAs a fantasy series, it was a really well-structured story designed to be heartwarming, building up for drama and inspiration almost every episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt work was the weakest element of the show. Neither characters nor backgrounds were usually detailed. In fact, it was noticeably cheap, but the lazy `ordinary life` atmosphere and hectic otaku madness was presented well.\\n\r\nCharacter designs are a bit heavy on moe, but quite distinguishable. I did not like how their faces were too wide in some scenes.\\n\r\nAnimation, like every other element of this show, had its moments. There are few scenes, mostly action or background had so much detail or great camera work that it takes you by surprise.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting of the siblings are done extremely well. Kirino usually sound annoying and bitchy like she should, and turn cute in dere scenes. You can just feel the emotion of her voice in touching scenes, and the squirmy perv laughs were adorable. Kyousuke's voice was smooth and easy to listen to. All other seiyuu cast were solid in my opinion, except Satou Satomi (Manami), whose high-pitch voice was overly moe and unnaturally childish for a 17-year old character.\\n\r\nThe heavy use of brass instruments in BGM was rather refreshing, but overall the music score did not leave a lasting impression. It did occasionally help set the pace for comedy or drama.\\n\r\nThe OP (song quality, suitability, visual presentation) is excellent. `Irony` by Claris itself is like a random technopop from Japanese idol group Perfume minus the auto-tune, but surprisingly catchy and appropriate in setting the mood for each episode. OP animation is always different, introducing the side characters that will appear for each episode and having same theme as the episode.\\n\r\nED songs are different for every episode, ED1-11 are selected from the public contest held in Nico Nico Douga, a Japanese video sharing website, and sang by seiyuu cast in this series. ED songs were pretty weak in general with excessive beats, but at least offer refreshment value. ED12 was written by Kousaki Satoru (who also handled BGM), and really shows the difference between pros and amateurs. ED vocals were insanely good though, especially for episode 4, 7, 8, and 11.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDespite being a late night UHF (independent station) anime about otaku, `OreImo` is very much a mainstream show designed for the general audience. I would think the more immersed in otaku culture you are, the more likely you will prefer `Genshiken` over this series because it goes far more in-depth on otaku culture.\\n\r\nHowever, this show is more of a feel-good sweet fairytale story about platonic brotherly and sisterly love. I wouldn`t go as far as saying this series is life/perspective-altering in any way, but it also sheds light on issues an otaku would face in real life, and attainment of acceptance by the general public, though a bit too much of an otaku glorification.\\n\\n\r\nIt's obvious a lot of effort was put into production, such as the revision of story structure which gave subtle character development despite the episodic format, the different \"Eye Catch\" (Cover/CD between commercials) as reference to other anime series, \"End Card\" (illustration that shows in end of the show, sometimes displayed in ED as well) drawn by various prominent manga/novel illustrators, different OP animation every episode (and sometimes use of OP in different places), and different EDs.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is not perfect as the drama feel a bit too forced at times, but it`s not about the logic... there`s something about it that really touches you. Watching this show naturally puts a smile on my face.\\n\\n\r\nI really like 'OreImo', I would even say that I LOVE it!\\n",

            "content": "Ore no Imouto is an uncommon example of a show that has fantastic production, but abominable execution. The concept is fairly original, featuring a younger sister who has a problem fitting in society as a high achieving student who is also balancing a hobby for collecting and playing imouto-themed eroge. While the show is beautiful with its detailed character/background designs, unique EDs for each episode, and decent voice acting, the show amounts to being almost completely worthless and an insult to the representation of otaku culture and the associated stigmas.\r\nLet's start off with the single worst thing about this show: Kirino.  Kirino is manythings.  She is a high achieving middle school student, a model, and an obsessive anime/eroge fan.  However above all, she is selfish, stubborn, and blatantly insensitive.  The latter qualities are something you usually give to either a villain, or anti-heroic character.  Kirino unfortunately is neither of those.  She is the heroine of the plot, and for the large part is never reprimanded for her flaws. It says little about the other characters of the story - especially her brother - when people around Kirino basically enable her unhealthy obsessions over imouto-themed eroge. For almost the entire series, Kirino is a bitch to her brother Kyousuke, who ends up becoming Kirino's bitch, slaving away to ensure Kirino gets everything she wants to feed her anime and eroge obsessions.  Is Kirino ever grateful? Not really. Up to the very last episode, she's still the same insensitive brat who wants to have her cake and eat it too, and she never truly apologizes for any of the illogically horrible things she does to her older brother.\\n\\n\r\nWhat was this show trying to accomplish?  Was this meant to be a comedy?  I didn't find it particularly funny when Kirino was kicking Kyosuke in the balls or ordering him to get run over by a truck for the sake of research. Was this meant to be a slice of life drama? Again what kind of a character would be ordering her older brother to get run over by a truck for crying out loud? Was this a tale of fantasy?  Maybe, because I sure as hell doubt that humans in the real world value villainous characters who get to have their cake and eat it too.  And yes, I do mean it when I say Kirino is villainous.  She deliberately goes out of her way to be cruel to people who help her, and she absolutely insists on having her way at all costs.\\n\\n\r\nDoes this show even do anything good?  Actually the first few episodes do manage to get your attention.  See, the concept for this show was actually decently original. There is a good number of people who would be able to relate to Kirino's problems of finding acceptance in her unusual hobbies.  Furthermore AIC is big on production values and they do a fairly impressive job of detailing some of the trips to Akihabara, conventions, cosplay contests, and a few other things. The unique EDs (and OP animations) don't hurt either.  This show really did have the framework set up to be something great.  But it's a huge insult to anime fans how despicable of a character Kirino is. Why does Kirino resent her brother so much?  Is it because she doesn't interact with him much?  Heck I have a younger sister who I interact with on an infrequent basis, and she likes anime.  But she has no reason to disdain me to the irrational extent Kirino does. And I consider myself a pretty strong anime fan, but Kirino is beyond obsessed in her collection of anime merchandise that takes up an entire closet space, and she is never grateful for all the trouble her brother goes to to add to that gigantic collection.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is a lesson to be learned from this show, it is not one about social acceptance.  More importantly, the main character of a story has to be appealing. In the end, Ore no Imouto makes many promises, but keeps none of them. By far the disappointment of Fall 2010, it is easily one of the worst shows AIC has produced by far.",

            "content": "Ore no Imouto is an entertaining and cute comedy that was thoroughly pleasant almost every moment. Those are basically the 2 things it offers, cuteness and comedy. But what makes it special is the unique brand of tsundere that the main female character, Kirino, possesses. The story is shown from the viewpoint of her brother, Kyousuke, which allows you, the viewer, to also be on the receiving end of Kirino's cuteness, which is particularly cute because of the complexity of her relationship with Kyousuke.\r\nThe main female characters look unbelievable cute, sound cute, and behave cutely, and it's a sexy-cute, not a childish cute. The cutenessdoesn't feel forced at all. It just naturally exudes from their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nI snicker and giggle the whole way through because it's very funny, just the kind of humor I love. There's no slapstick, gags, or chibi transformations, which tend to be mildly funny at best. This is quality humor.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not all humor. The experiences they have and problems they overcome feel good to watch, and they haven't felt forced so far. Rather, they are quite natural.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are wonderful. They seem very real. The main characters, Kyousuke, the brother, and Kirino, the sister, have a very believable relationship where they sort of act like they just \"tolerate\" each other, yet very much do care for each other and both know it, but coming out and saying it bluntly would be embarrassing. It's really a very common type of sibling rivalry/relationship.\\n\\n\r\nUnderstanding this relationship is key to your enjoyment of the show. It seems many viewers don't understand this and so they think that Kirino is an unrealistically ungrateful bitch and her brother unrealistically puts up with it without complaint. But ironically, if you understand that they are really just pretending to only just \"tolerate\" each other, but really care about each other, this is what makes the show very unique and realistic. And it's why Kirino is so darn cute. So try to understand this while watching, and look for the hidden message or vibe that Kirino is sending even when she acts angry, and never take her \"mean\" act literally.\\n\\n\r\nKyousuke is a great character, and seems to act just how I would want him to act. He's cool, reliable, sharp, and witty. Kirino is a tsundere-type character, but doesn't seem at all like a cliche. Kyousuke will sacrifice himself for his sister, which makes for some great moments as it breaks down Kirino \"defenses\" and forces her to acknowledge her brother's sacrifices with a grudging but sincere \"thanks\".  The other characters have strong personalities as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe colors in the animation are bold and detailed, and camera angles and viewpoints are always keeping it fresh. The music complements the scenes very well, often breaking into the great \"theme song\" during feel-good resolutions of Kirino's problems when both Kyousuke and the viewers are rewarded with Kirino's cute fighting spirit or her grudging show of gratitude. It actually feels on par with an epic climatic scene in some lengthy drama.\\n\\n\r\nTowards the end of the series, there were some things I didn't like. The transition from one scene to another was sometimes very sudden, and some details that were important for the next scene were not sufficiently explained, almost like they were short on time and had to condense things. This happens in the last two episodes. In fact, the climatic moment in the final episode is extremely sudden, has no foreshadowing that I can see leading up to it, isn't clear whether it is intentional or accidental on the part of Kirino, and leaves me to have to wonder and speculate about what Kirino's thought's were leading up to the moment. I feel like Kirino should have shown signs that she was dealing with a tough dilemma, then we would then wonder what it was, and then the climatic moment would provide the answer. But as it is, it just leaves me puzzled.\\n\\n\r\nBut overall, this was one of my favorite shows. It was hilarious, cute, and the best part is the unique personality of Kirino that is full of cute subtleties which I can easily relate to. Not your typical tsundere.",

            "content": "Believe me when I say to you, this is not what you were expecting. I've found brother-sister anime to be all either A: incestuous, or B: Completely boring. Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai takes the brand new option C: Incredible. I consider myself to watch things that have a decent amount of quality to them. I don't like to waste my time watching things that end up wasting my time. After reading the description of this anime, I brushed it aside. However, after taking notice that there was quite a bit of support for the anime, I changed my mind oneboring Tuesday afternoon and downloaded the first three episodes. By the end of the first episode, I was completely immersed in the engaging storyline and the complex characters. Rarely does an anime bring me into the world of its characters, and rarely do I find myself connecting on a personal level with characters in the anime. I won't waste your time: if you're already interested in this anime, watch it. You don't even need to read the rest of this review. I'll say it right now: you're in for a real treat today.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first read the description here on MAL, I was skeptical. Very skeptical. Slice of life anime doesn't always have the most engaging plot structure. It tends to lack a definite climax, and often times, it seems like there's a lot left unresolved. However, Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai (further referenced as Ore no Imouto) was different. The first episode immerses you into its storyline, pulling you into its characters and plot, and each successive episode only serves to pull you in deeper. What was wonderful about this anime was its humor. Simply put, the story is about the strengthening of the bond between a brother and sister. The humor in this anime comes from the relationship a brother and a sister have, and, at times, the boundaries that are set by a society for a brother and sister. The story progresses as the main character's younger sister needs his help more and more. I won't give any sort of definite summary in this review. All I want to say is that the story moves continuously, there is no junk anywhere in this anime. Furthermore, the storyline is more than engaging enough to keep anyone entertained. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nI didn't find the artwork to be all too impressive. However, it was plainly effective for what it set out to do. However, I would like to comment on the work that was done within anime of other fictional animes. Throughout the anime, there are other anime that appear as part of the interests of certain characters. The illustrators of Ore no Imouto did a fabulous job distinguishing the different tastes between Kirino and Kuroneko (Ruri). The contrast between these two characters made by the artwork shown in the anime that they watch greatly adds to the impression given to the reader that they're both crazy otaku, with wildly different tastes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nI personally found no enjoyment out of the audio in this anime. While it wasn't terrible, it wasn't just outstanding. It fit the anime, which is of course what was important, but it couldn't stand up to the level of artistic intuition of the other 3 categories. It just wasn't there. There wasn't a place to put it even. Not that I can complain. The entire anime is consumed with substantial dialogue that really makes it what it is.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters make this anime what it is. The characters in this anime are perfectly matched to create the perfect story. In my opinion, story is nothing without characters. The characters perfectly meld together to form interesting situations, which result in multiple laugh out loud moments. I think most people will agree that they don't laugh to themselves very often when they watch an anime. I laughed quite a few times, but at other times, this anime can capture your heart, because again, the relationship between a brother and a sister can become quite emotional. This is seen towards the end of the anime, and it is very emotional. Kyousuke Kousuka, played by Yuuichi Nakamura is the perfect older brother for this anime. By far my favorite character, his sarcastic commentary and his use of logic contrast brilliantly with his little sister's illogical and child-like desires, which seemingly have no bounds and which is he almost forced to accept. And that's just two of the characters. And normally, that's what you get out of an anime. The main characters are good, but usually, your supporting actors and actresses are a little boring. I loved several of the supporting characters in this anime, and I wish they could have made it longer so that their part in the story and their relationship with the main character could be made more definite, especially the Kyousuke and Kirino's friends, Akagi, Manami, and Ayase.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nDespite what the anime lacked, I really enjoyed it. I don't think any sort of review will truly do this anime justice. This is easily one of the most humorous anime I have ever seen, with a witty and clever take on the relationship between a brother and sister. The anime kept its focus, and thereby keeps its viewers interested in the storyline and wanting more. The only problem I had with this anime was that it actually ended with only 12 episodes. Such a wonderful anime should have gone on longer, however I am definitely satisfied with the impact it left me. \\n\\n\r\nJust a few concluding remarks: I'd like to say this is not a ecchi incestuous anime. Although it at times hints towards that kind of anime, and although eroge does play a part in this anime, it is not actually between the two main characters. This anime seriously examines what it means to have a sibling, and the implications involved. This anime is truly something to be enjoyed for its outlook on the responsibilities of an older brother to his younger sister, and what it truly means to be there, selflessly sacrificing yourself, when someone really needs you.\\n",

I also like the fact that they don't really design the little sister (Kirino) to be really sexy, and even point out her affection for the imooto-ero games is pure, which makes the anime a lot more comfortable to watch.  I hope its not like Kiss X Sis, that one weirded me out.\r\nI'd agree with the last reviewer, the series has a lot of potential.Most of the really funny stuff was during the end credits, and if that's any indication of the season, I can't wait for more.",

            "content": "Sisters. They can sure be a pain, and I know based on experience. They might cause you trouble and make you unhappy at times, but they really don't want that deep down. This seems to be the case in Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai (My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute), but maybe it was taken a little too far. I'll explain later.\r\nStory: 6\r\nLet me go over the story real quick. Kyousuke finds an eroge game in a DVD case. Kirino talks with him and reveals her hidden side; she's goes gaga for little sister eroges. Kyousuke decides to help herout with \"life counseling\" sessions to get her to open up with her secret hobby. I'm not gonna lie, it's an interesting story, to say the least. I mean we can all relate. We have secrets we might not want others to know. The problem for me is that it felt stereotypical and predictable. It had some twists near the end. but for the most part, I knew what was going to happen. Speaking of the ending, I thought it was quite sudden, which seemed forced to fit into the 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nI'm not gonna say much about this. Nothing spectacular. Quite generic. The end.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nI wasn't impressed by the sound used. The OP and EDs are forgettable. I honestly can't remember much that stood out at all. Oh well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nThis is what made me really dislike this show. I don't care what anybody says; I hate Kirino with a passion so strong, it can only be compared to the force of a thousand suns. She was utterly useless for nearly the entirety of the series. I guess this is a little biased, because I hate people who care only about themselves, but that's just me. To me, she's a terrible person. She's not the only problem. Kyousuke, for example. He bland and boring. He has his moments, but they're scarce. This show has good characters though, like Manami and her grandfather. The problem is that they barely get any screen time, especially the grandfather who's only in one episode. Kuroneko and Saori are pretty alright characters as well, but they can't save the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a story that had potential. It could have gone deeper, explaining the difficult relationship between Kyousuke helping Kirino accept the she has a hobby that she can't keep secret forever, but instead, we get a whiny sister and a boring brother doing stereotypical otaku things. I guess they really tried to appeal to otakus and weeaboos.",

            "content": "I can't help but feel this show got a little to mainstream for it's own good, hopefully without descending into a rant this show has evidently been watched by many users who knew full well they had no fondness for this sort of show going into it.\r\nOre no Imouto is at times nothing short of brilliant. While not quite up there with shows like Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu, when contrasted with more standard efforts like Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu this show it truly special. \r\nOur story follows Kyousuke who inadvertently stumbles across his seemingly perfect younger sister Kirino's secret obsession with little sister's (in gamesand anime). He reluctantly chooses to support her and they progressively grow closer through Kirino's hobby.\\n\r\nIt's not the greatest idea for a story, especially straight off the back of Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu which had little else going for it bar the novelty of the idea. The premise does serve to give the show an excuse to delve around Otaku culture and scenario's it would other wise struggle to incorporate into this sort of show.\\n\\n\r\nDepending on your tolerance and standards there is allot of subtle, or at times not so subtle fan service in this show, the character models are distinct and fantastically realised, the backgrounds are rich and vivid, the whole experience is visually cheerful and vibrant. If you hold this up against pretty much any comedy it's right up there with the best of them animation wise.\\n\r\nThe sound track complements the cheery atmosphere of the show well, i wasn't overly fond of the dramatic score they used for every dramatic scene, it seemed a little over the top at times. The voice acting was first rate, again distinctive injecting genuine individuality into a first rate cast of characters, production values are something to rave about here, AAA standard all the way.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters for this show are truly exceptional, i'd rate the supporting cast as the best i've ever come across in a show bar none, all this considering i didn't especially like Kirino at any point in the show. Kyousuke can be compared with the Kyon's and the Tomoya Okazaki's of anime, exactly the same mold slightly sarcastic darkly likeable male lead. Kirino is loud, bold, spoilt and dominant, not my favourite among the female cast by some distance, but her personality is necessary to drive the story forward. \\n\r\nSupporting cast member's Ayase, Kanako, Saori, Ruri even Kiriko's father, are simplly first rate, my only complaint would be they didn't get more combined screen time, an excellent mix of weird and wonderful characters who often overshadow the leads.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment wise for all my positiveness there were a good few episodes that were genuinely tedious, the episode they spent pitching an anime to studio execs springs to mind fairly quickly. This should not detract from the good 75% of brilliant material, many genuinely laugh out loud moments, a fantastic pacing and energy to the whole experience and a surprisingly good spread of themes, episode styles and character face time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it is a crime in my eyes that both the front page reviews score this show to be 1 point above an average show, this was easily among the best shows in what was an especially strong season, and one of the better slice of life comedies you could hope to come across, do not be put off this is one of the easiest watches you will come across.",

            "content": "As a little sister with an older brother, I was totally against this series the moment I heard about it. Incest in general is just all sorts of wrong, wrong, WRONG. Plus, everything about this anime just screams \"hentai doujinshi fodder\".\r\nPutting that aside, I gave this series a chance because I was attracted by the beautiful animation and cute character designs and I was actually pleasantly surprised. \r\nAlthough there are some questionable camera shots of Kirino from Kyosuke's point of view (for the fanboys, I suppose), their overall relationship remains sibling-like and both characters are thoroughly put off by anything more than that. I'm notsure how this will develop in later episodes/chapters but so far it hasn't really set off any \"creepy/gross!\" alarms.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I enjoyed most (besides beautiful animation) is the humor. I chuckled at several scenes (I really enjoyed Kyosuke's \"Kick her off the bed!\" selection in the eroge game, mostly because that's what any REAL big brother would choose).\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I can't say this is an anime for everyone, cause there really are some truly crazy creepy people out there that would read way into Kyosuke and Kirino's relationship...I would advise those people to stay away (please). Otherwise, it's a heartwarming story about a big brother protecting/supporting his little sis (and who doesn't just find that adorable, even in real life?).",

            "content": "Ore no Imouto or My Little Sister Can't be this Cute is quite possibly one of the most deceptive anime I have ever seen.\r\nInitially I stayed away from this show because I was quite weary of the rather ludicrous premise and the title made me think I was in for another incest anime. However, like any other hyped anime, sometimes one just has to see what is the deal with the popularity.\r\nFirst of all, I'll admit that the initial episodes showed promising signs. My fears of this turning into some sort of incestual fetish anime were dispelled almost immediately, and better yet, the premise whilerather ridiculous was merely a vehicle for a much more well grounded and relateable plot. At the beginning of the show, our main protagonist Kyousuke is seen to be in a rather broken relationship with his younger sister Kirino until, by accident, discovers that his sister is an closet otaku who apparently loves eroge games involving little sisters. The later confrontations over this fact would later lead to Kyousuke getting involved in his sister's secret lifestyle, and it is quite possible for this once broken sibling relationship to make amends over the glorious hobbies of an otaku.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all this, my initial positive impression of this show would quickly go down the drain. The show which initially presented itself both seriously and earnestly, became very dishonest. I really was tricked into thinking that they'd treat the otaku issues at least semi-seriously. The way those around her accept her as is puts me in utter disbelief. What was the point of her hiding her hobby in the first place if it was going to seem so easy to get more out in the open with it?\\n\\n\r\nI should have honestly seen the warning signs. Why of course, not only is our otaku in this show a moe bait girl, but she is also presented as absolutely perfect in anything she does. It's both hard to sympathize and care for the character Kirino when almost everything always works out for her.This is further exasperated by the protagonist and side character's willingness to be at her beckon call whenever a problem does arrive.\\n\\n\r\nIt is quite apparent by at least the mid point of this show, that all Ore no Imouto truly wanted to be was some clever marketing scheme to create an otaku wish fulfillment fantasy anime. If there is one thing that I do not appreciate in anime, it is being patronized by the creators of a show. And my god, this show was certainly an insult to my intelligence.\\n\\n\r\nI say this of course without even mentioning just how insufferable Kirino is. Tsundere is the sort of trope where if you execute it well, you probably have a decent character in your grasp, but if you make a mess out of it, you get Louise from ZnT, and trust me, that's not a good thing...\\n\\n\r\nThere are not many shows where the mere presence of one character seems to drag down the rest of the cast with them. Each and every character is bashed to death with the stupid stick anytime a situation with Kirino arises, in particular the main character Kyousuke. The only saving grace in the cast ever being the goth lolita charcter Kuroneko (They should just a spin off series about her). Hey even I admit that she's a bitch, but at least she's a bitch I can find amusing and sympathize with. There's absolutely nothing sympathetic about the character Kirino. She expresses belligerent behavior to those around her, especially her brother, without consequence and we're supposed to sit here and laugh.\\n\\n\r\nThis is merely another breaking point in my suspension of disbelief (As if I hadn't reached that threshold already to some degree) for this anime. One cannot simply accept that a brother, Kyousuke, who supposedly hates his sister, would go to hell and back for a sister that shows anything but kindness to him. It just doesn't make sense. Either Kyousuke is one of the greatest saints I have seen in fiction or the writing here is just terrible and breaks characterization. To say the least, it's not enjoyable to watch either way.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up without ranting too much about this trash series... If you dislike tsunderes, stay away. If you dislike otaku-wish fulfillment animes, stay away. If you are looking for a real down to earth exploration of a sibling relationship. I repeat, stay away.\\n\\n\r\nAll we have here is an otaku wish fulfillment anime centralized around a Mary Sue character. If that is something you enjoy, go ahead. Otherwise, you have been warned.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "[Please take note that I watched all the 15 episodes of this anime, so this review is based also on those special episodes and on the real ending].\r\nOtaku activity, like watching anime and especially playing eroges is usually viewed to be a hobby of a young adult males that are a little outcast. Surely, there's no way that a model middle schooler could do things like that.\r\nOr is there a way? Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai is an anime that tells you a story of a high schooler named Kyousuke Kousaka. His relationship with his sister named Kirino Kousaka ispretty troublesome, and the anime centers around that relationship. I have always liked sister & brother stories, and on top of that the anime also involves a lot of otaku culture in it. Kirino is a top achiever in her school, great athlete and also a model. And, when no one sees, she also plays eroge games and watches anime. One night, she shows her secret to his brother and asks for a life counselling. The idea itself is pretty unique to me, and from the start this anime seemed to be very funny. The story itself is not bad, but what I really liked was the characters, Kirino is a a character that you want to hug tightly, but at the same time you want to beat him to death. It seems like she is your usual tsundere, but I think she is more than that. Kirino's father is an old fashioned man that has no tolerance for things like eroge. And her mother is your typical kind mother. The only character which I didn't like that much is, surprisingly, the main character. Kyousuke could have had some balls to stand up against his sister. Their relationship works fine this way also, but I would have wanted to see him getting really mad at Kirino some times.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen you put this setting into action, you can't have a bad anime. Kyousuke's and Kirino's relationship is one very interesting thing, It's like you are waiting for them to either kill each other or commit something that is also illegal at any point. It doesn't help that Kirino also plays eroges that have the objective of charming your own little sister, the sibling complex is there all the time, kinda lurking in the shadows when Kirino acts all tsundere and I love it. But there's no way that Kirino would ever look her brother that way right, it would be gross! However, in her games it's not. At the same time Kyousuke just tries to not give a fuck and just help his sister. When you mix this up with very tight dad that has no understanding for anything like that, you get very comical and enjoyable anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe otaku culture is also very relevant in this anime. Part of this anime deals with problems that one faces when prejudged based on his hobby. You play eroges, so you are a gross human being. This anime really tries to break that and teach you that any thing that brings you such joy and unifies people like that can't be that bad. At least I saw a meaning like that behind this anime, which is a nice thing. In the end, it's just a hobby, but all people don't understand that. That plus Kirino's and Kyousuke's relationship really made this anime worthwhile. I must also mention that is was funny to see her playing those eroges, since I have played some myself and all those things that happen in that anime regarding that are very true. Anyone who watches anime can relate himself to this story and feel accepted.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending changes every episode, and there is not even one bad ending there, I liked them all. On top of that, I loved The opening. The art seems to be your normal modern style art, very bright colors that actually do fit very well in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was very funny and at the same time very interesting anime that still didn't forget to convey some kinda message through you. You won't waste your time watching this.",

However, it will be referred to as \u201cOreimo\u201d in this review for convenience.\r\nThe Good:\r\n-Great animation and voice acting\r\n-Not afraid to poke fun at its own stereotypes\r\n-Great cast of colourful characters\r\nThe Bad:\r\n-Great cast doesn\u2019t have enough time in the limelight\r\n-Most of the story progression is only in the first half\r\n-Seems too short for what it sets out to do\r\nSynopsis:\r\nThe plot focuses on 17-year old Kousaka Kyousuke and his 14-year old sister Kirino. As they were growing up, Kyousuke and Kirino\u2019s relationship was pretty muchnon-existent, and besides occasionally exchanging pleasantries and arguing, they stayed out of each other\u2019s way. One day, Kyousuke discovers a case for a Magical Girl anime called \u201cStardust Witch Meruru\u201d and wonders where it came from. Upon opening the case, he discovers a DVD for an adult hentai game. He is dumbfounded and has no idea where it came from. He later discovers that both the DVD case and the game belong to Kirino. Later that night, Kirino calls Kyousuke into her room and reveals that she is an otaku and has an extensive collection of anime and adult hentai DVDs that she had been collecting in secret and hiding from her family. However, Kirino struggles with her hobby because she knows how much otaku are looked down upon by society, and so she implores Kyousuke to help her come to terms with her hobby and to help her find friends with similar interests. Kyousuke doesn\u2019t understand much about the hobby or about what\u2019s going on, but he reluctantly agrees to help Kirino.\\n\\n\r\nThe main thing I liked about Oreimo is that is isn\u2019t exaggerated in any way, as far as human interaction goes. It is firmly planted in reality and never tries to stray from it. This doesn\u2019t mean everything that takes place in it takes place every day in real life, however; Kirino\u2019s relationship with her hobby is soon apparent to be somewhat exaggerated, perhaps in an attempt to explain to casual anime viewers that being an otaku is just as much a hobby as any other. On the same token, though Kirino\u2019s hobby is a mainstay in her lifestyle, she is still firmly planted in reality, and even has a job as a model to pay for the games and anime she buys. Kyousuke\u2019s character, I found, is even moreso planted in reality. He doesn\u2019t have a full grasp on his sister\u2019s hobby and the way she acts, and he even shows fear of his sister, only standing up to her in dire situations.  Though Kirino was the one who implored Kyousuke to help her with her struggles, she often implies she doesn\u2019t enjoy his company, even though she consistently forces him to spend time with her. Oreimo is a comedy through and through, and even with that said, it is wholly injected with a  healthy dose of reality.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some things I disliked about Oreimo, however. It is only twelve episodes long. I feel like that really isn\u2019t long enough for the show to do what it sets out to do. There is a twist, however; Episode 12 is only an \u201calternative\u201d ending. From my understanding, there will be a \u201ctrue\u201d ending released with the BD/DVD release of the anime. At the time of this writing, it\u2019s not out yet, but I\u2019m sure they will be made available shortly after release. I found this to be a unique twist on an otherwise underwhelming ending, and I\u2019ll definitely be interested in seeing it when released.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I disliked is that most of its story progression only happens in the first half of the anime, while not a whole lot happens in the second half other than character interaction. This isn\u2019t always a bad thing; sometimes the story set-up is more than enough to carry the show for the rest of its run. However, I sort of wished the story went a bit farther than it did.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this said, Oreimo is a hilarious take on a very real situation, and it is probably the best anime of the fall. I highly recommend it if you love comedy.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Rating: 9/10\\n",

            "content": "I thing I love about anime and manga (though I don't really read manga) is its ability not to take itself too seriously and the way it pokes fun of the extreme otaku's especially the grown men who are into magical girl anime. You know who you are!\r\nOre no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai is a gem of an anime and something a lot of anime fans can relate to as in no one really understands why we watch it.\r\nThe story follows Kyousuke Kousaka, a Mr Average, who doesn't excel or suck at anything. His little sister Kirano on the other hand isbrilliant at everything, school, sports and is even a model. What's more they don't get on. However, Kousaka discovers that Kirano has a big secret, she is a hardcore otaku for magical anime and sister love eroge. Despite their differences and not understanding why she is into what she's into he agrees to keep her secret and helps take her first steps in to otaku culture where they both make new friends.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty I began watching Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai with a bit of trepidation after reading the synopsis as I feared the brother and sister would become lovers. I am pleased to say this never materialised. Instead the main aspect of the story is the building of the normal brother and sister relationship of Kousaka and Kirano which they never had before. This is also a harem anime, however, although there are romantic opportunities for Kousaka he is actually despised by one or two of the female characters so we don't have to endure the usual harem anime jokes. The comedy in Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai is very good and I did find myself laughing out loud on many occasions.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the many of the characters. Kousaka is a good central character, essentially plays the straight man and being the butt of may of the jokes. He is also a great older brother suffering at the hands of a bratish and stubborn little sister who struggles to appreciate what her brother does for her. Kirano is a character you will like in the end or hate. Her bratish personality is deliberate and essential to the story which makes watching her get over herself all the more better. \\n\\n\r\nBecause Kousaka plays the straight man it enables the other characters to shine. The most interesting of all is the cosplaying Kuroneko who represents the anime fans who watch anime to escape for a while their normal lives. We also find out a little, but just enough to get us interested, of the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nOre no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai was never going to be a masterpiece but is an enjoyable and fun comedy yet able to sentimental without being mushing. Well worth watching.",

            "content": "Most people don't seem to understand that this is an anime, and therefore isn't really intending to accurately portray real life. Most critiques I have seen so far of Ore no Imouto are \"My friend told me to watch it because he/she said it was really good, but it was just some anime catering to the otakus of the industry\". Reviewer then proceeds to either make fun of otakus, or even more amusing, says why this anime is actually... just an anime! An anime being anime-like? Taboo.\r\nOre no Imouto takes a cliche school / slice of life anime setup and sets it at a newangle. Sure, some of the character designs are stereotypical, but they're all created that way to convey a certain feeling to the audience. That feeling, at least in the anime (because I highly suspect the original was romantic love) is actually sibling or familial love. To break it down for those of you who still think Ore no Imouto is cliche: I don't know of any other anime that really discusses sibling love in a more mature light than this one.\\n\r\nPeople complain about Kyousuke being a wimp, and for the most part, he definitely appears to seem like one. However, consider his father, who is actually portrayed somewhat realistically. As a sibling myself, I can clearly see how the iron fist of a father's control over something that is your favorite hobby could really lead the siblings to come together and make amends for their past.\\n\\n\r\nAnother argument people have against Ore no Imouto is the \"girl who loves eroge\" cliche/catering to otakus. While it could be seen in this light, I saw it as the stereotypical anime exaggeration that we see everywhere, in order to make an important point. We see Kyousuke fighting for his sister's rights to appreciate and enjoy her own hobby at her own leisure without being judged by others around her. It's a wonderful message to send across, despite it being moved by the eroge factor. However, it's the very fact that Kirino's hobby is eroge that shows if Kyousuke can justify this hobby to those around him, any hobby can be justified, and in general, any action that does not harm anyone else.\\n\r\nIt sends a message to those radically in opposition of hobbies that others have, and a general message of acceptance. Kirino, by the end of the series, seems to be hated by many viewers for what she has done to Kyousuke. Part of that appears to be intentional, as it leaves the audience wondering \"How can Kyousuke put up with all of the crap Kirino does to him?\" \\n\r\nIt's true, it seems unbelievable, and is highly unlikely in today's world. But since when has anime ever tried to accurately portray reality? Most of us watch anime because it glorifies simple personalities and relationships between people, transforming them into something wonderful. We watch it because it gives us an escape into a world that we enjoy watching, or may even want to live in, because it is so radically emotionally different than our world. \\n\\n\r\nIt seems that some people are forgetting the magic of anime that led all of us to watch it in the first place. Ore no Imouto is, quite secretively, one of the more poignant animes of Fall 2010, and was a true joy to watch.",

Then I started rewatching it, and I was completely wrong.\r\nStory - 10\r\nThe story has a very unique plot that I've never seen in any other anime, which is about a girl named Kirino Kousaka who is obsessed with cute eroge games. She goes through her life hiding a huge amount of eroges with the help of her brother Kyousuke Kousaka, although they don't get along very well.\r\nArt - 10\r\nEven before I saw the anime, Iwas really captivated with the artwork. I think the eyes are extremely well done, not just because they give off a lot of emotion, but I love the style. It's clean-cut, and very detailed aswell, such as the styling of the hair, shine on the eyes, blush on the face, and folds and shading in the clothing.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\\n\r\nThe voices for the characters are perfect, each fitting each of the characters idealy. They're also very well done. Whichever emotion the character has, and depending on what she or he is doing, the seiyuu fits it accurately and makes it believable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\\n\r\nI LOVE the characters! All of them are very likeable, despite their differences. I particularly like the way they act around each other, as they don't all get along too well, so it's enjoyable to watch how each of them respond to each others' actions. They're all very cute and I love them all, but Kirino is my favorite~\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall - 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed ever part of this anime very much. Everything was perfect, and I couldn't ask for any more or any less. I loved everything about it and it was really fun and entertaining to watch, so I give it all a big 10! \\n\\n\r\nI don't know if everyone will like it as much as me, but I recommend it to everyone~! :D",

            "content": "IMO, this anime is mediocre at best. People at general seem to like it, but maybe I just don't see its full potential. I do like the ending.\r\nKyosuke, the male lead is a doormat. He suffers from apathy, and who can blame him? Putting with all the shit his little sister does. He is basically a slave to her problems and desires and has none of his own. Yes, he gets some affection - but hell, for all the effort he is putting in that's insane. We can't put all the blame on his sister, he is a pushover.\r\nKirino, the female lead. I hate hercharacter. She is basically a tsundere on steroids. The entire story revolves around her problems of being a model and a closet otaku and how her \"big brother\" helps her out. Its not as much helping out as it is pure slavery. She drags him doing shit he doesn't want, puts responsibility on him to deal with her things.. Nonsense drama. \\n\\n\r\nSupposedly the anime is great because of how real the interaction between brother/sister are and how they go from step one to uncover their true feelings. That's all good and that's the hook of the anime. I don't like the way Kyosuke acts. He is way too much of a doormat and a pushover and the entire anime is about that. How can an anime be about revealing feelings when the male lead doesn't take any action or reveal any feelings to the bullshit he is facing? Nonsense drama, that's how.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great though. Very well drawn. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend it and don't at the same time. But that's just my view on it. \\n",

So far, every episode managed to unfold into how the two get closer to each other as the older brother helps his sister with common teen problems. \r\nThe story is different from other brother-sister relationship anime. Told from the brother's point of view, it's light and has no weird physical and romantic interaction between the two. I like how he started from not even talking to his sister to how he realizesat the end of the day something new or an improvement with his sister. \\n\\n\r\nHaving said that, I like the brother's character a lot. He's sort of ideal as a brother. He acts, responds, reacts and shows his love for his sister naturally as how any boy should. On the other hand, his sister depicts any sibling with a whole lot of pride, asking for help from someone you don't expect to get help from. It's also fun to watch how she turns to her brother for help and learns to appreciate him.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is good and is highly recommended to those who would like to see some family values in a different way.",

            "content": "Every season we seem to get that one show that has all the buzz and word of mouth about it from the anime community.  This time most of that was centered on this anime, Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai.  I will admit that from the first time I saw details of this show pop up I was not to thrilled with its prospects, but the hype over the show was too much to ignore and I decided to give it a go.  In the end I am left wonder just what was all the fuss about?\r\nFrom the startwe are setup with our typical and predictable harem anime plot, a high school guy Kyousuke who is fairly nondescript and normal finds himself involved in his little sister's secret hobby, eroge games and anime.  Since up till now his sister, Kirino, has basically had nothing to do with him so both her secret and her sudden willingness to open up to him is a complete surprise.  Now he finds himself helping Kirino acquire new eroge, hide her hobby from her friends, help her make new friends, and I suppose repair their sibling relationship.  Seriously a pair of siblings find happiness through the power of eroge!  Are you kidding?  Is this a PSA for the eroge industry?\\n\\n\r\nNow I haven\u2019t read any of the light novels so I can\u2019t speak for how well this anime does as an adaptation of them.  Though I can say that if this really is a good adaption then I think I will pass.  It\u2019s not that Ore Imouto is a bad anime either; it\u2019s just really uninteresting.  Watching this show wasn't a chore but I just kept wondering to myself, why isn't this any good?  I can usually see why someone might like or dislike an anime more that I do but with this one I cant for the life of me understand how anyone could think this one is any good.  The lack of any interesting story makes this anime completely character driven and since the characters are so awful it just feels like it doesn't get anywhere nor do you care if it does or doesn't.   Elements of the plot eventually becomes so totally implausible and unrealistic that they defy belief.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall Ore Imouto is an idealistic view of how otaku and anime fans want to be viewed by others.  It clearly panders to the otaku community and those who fancy themselves as wannabe otaku, i.e. weeaboo\u2019s.  They really aren't creepy guys who cuddle with full size oppai body pillows on the train or buy an anime special edition box because they have a pair of blue striped panties inside. They are fashion models, Buddhist monks, and super rich oujosama's!  It\u2019s not that I have anything against otaku mind you, but at the same time I don\u2019t find the lifestyle to be particularly interesting or commendable.  While I do think Ore Imouto tries to deal with some serious issues at times, Kirino's character makes it impossible to really accept them.  On the plus side I will give the anime credit for not caving in completely to the fan base by drowning the show in pervy fan service.\\n\\n\r\nThe main issue overall with the story is there is too little of everything.  There isn\u2019t any story to speak of, though that would probably be ok if it was completely episodic, but it\u2019s not.  We start out with Kirino's hobby being laid out and the drama that unfolds as her best friend and her father find out about it.  Both are coincidentally very anti-anime/eroge.  Though I can\u2019t really blame them really too much for the later, I mean she is in middle school for god's sake and watching/playing those things is technically illegal for her.  Kyousuke stands up for her every time along the way.  It actually sounds kind of inspiring and sweet but it isn\u2019t (more on why later).  \\n\\n\r\nThe romantic elements don\u2019t work either, since we really aren\u2019t given much about each character to think there is even a relationship developing.  There is really no chemistry between any of the characters either.  This is mostly due to Kyousuke's complete and utter lack of anything resembling personality.  The ending is also bad, but not unexpected given the genre and this lack of chemistry.  \\n\\n\r\nThe lead Kyousuke is without a doubt one of the most uninteresting characters I have seen in recent memory.  He seems to exemplify the ordinary lifeless harem lead.  It seems he has absolutely no interests of his own.  A look into his room shows a barren waste that lacks even the most Spartan decor and might as well just be a room at a hotel.  I think his room tells you a lot about him because like him, the only time it contains anything is when it belongs to someone else.  He is like an empty glass, waiting to be filled by whomever he comes into contact with.  I mean sure, he is a really nice guy.  He helps his sister and her friends whenever they need him, every time!  All of this without any thought or expectation of a reward.  However it feels more like he does out of sheer boredom than anything else.  He doesn\u2019t seem to really care one way or the other about anyone, especially his sister.  You get the feeling that he\u2019s helping her out of an obligation as her brother.  Of course why would he like, let alone love her or want to help her for any other reason?  She\u2019s nothing but a complete bitch to him anyway.\\n\\n\r\nKirino is on the surface your standard tsundere archetype.  Visually she\u2019s got everything that makes for otaku wet dreams but under the pretty exterior lays one of ugliest and most unsympathetic characters in anime.  There is a really fine line to walk when doing tsundere characters.  The difference \"tsundere\" and a \"bitch\" is extremely small.  Kirino falls squarely on the side of the bitch.  Her actions are not cute nor are they even funny.  She\u2019s conniving, mean-spirited, selfish, vain, disloyal, and wholly unlikable.  Despite apparently \"loving\" her brother she treats him totally opposite, in true tsundere fashion but unlike most characters in this archetype she never backs down at all from this role.  She uses everyone in the cast for her own selfish wants and then casts them away when she doesn\u2019t need them anymore.  Unable to even stay true to her new otaku friends she shuns them as soon as her \"cool\" personality and friendship with the \u201cin crowd\u201d is threatened.  Additionally she is utterly unbelievable as a character.  We are supposed to believe she is popular, athletic, a professional model, successful novelist, an imouto, AND an otaku?  All before even entering high school?  Right...\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the anime little has changed for either Kirino or Kyousuke.  They haven\u2019t grown at all as characters or as people.  Kyousuke remains an emotionless robotic proxy with no will or dreams of his own and still unable to see all the girls throwing themselves at his corpse of a personality.  If Kirino had become better at expressing her love for her brother and her friends or even learned to embrace her hobby openly without care as to what other people thought, it might have made her character easier to take.\\n\\n\r\nWith lead characters this bad it really makes the supporting characters seem even worse by comparison, or better depending on who you\u2019re talking about.  The downside is everyone with the exception of Kuroneko and to a lesser degree Manami.  Manami is Kyousuke's childhood friend and I suppose defacto girlfriend was a likable character who I actually felt pity for than anything else.  She is poorly developed and mostly ignored by the plot but from a cast that is so poorly conceived she stands as a lone bright spot.  In a better cast and with better leads she is probably lost as just an also-ran character.\\n\\n\r\nKuroneko on the other hand is different.  She is actually a really interesting and well implemented character.  As one of Kirino's new otaku friends she is basically everything that Kirino is not.  She is true to herself and loyal to her friends.  She is responsible and trustworthy and has her priorities in line.  In one episode that shows her taking care of her little sister you can see from her actions that she honestly loves her sibling as she plays with her, puts up with her favorite anime, which she despises but she does so anyway.  Although she is well aware that people and even her family thinks she is weird and abnormal, she doesn\u2019t care and does as she likes.  Because it gives her enjoyment.  In my opinion Kirino doesn\u2019t deserve her as a friend.  Of all the people in this cast the only one I would want to hang out with willingly and be friends with is her.\\n\\n\r\nOre Imouto's visual aspects are top notch however.  The character designs are pleasing to the eye and well proportioned.  The settings and backgrounds are well done though a bit bland in some cases.  Kirino's room is probably the most interesting with the most amount of things lying about.  Some of the visual parodies and references to other anime and games I found were pretty amusing.  Particularly those relating to Fate/Stay Night which appeared several times.   I did enjoy the lack of tits and ass from the production and that went a long way towards making the show far less perverse as I had initially assumed it would be.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast is also strong, featuring Ayana Takeatsu fresh off her success as Azusa from K-ON in the title role.  It\u2019s too bad she wasn\u2019t given a better character to work with, but I think she played the part as well as it could have been.  Other favorites of mine such as Yukari Tamura and Saori Hayami play smaller roles but overall I found all the performances to be very good.  The music is a definite strength as well; ChariS OP \"irony\" is one of the better anime songs of the year.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes down to it Ore Imouto is the kind of disposable anime that comes along every year.  While it got more than its share of hype and press it is unlikely to be remembered in the years to come.  I don\u2019t necessarily think this is a terrible show, it has aspects that I think are terrible but overall I can\u2019t say I hated it either.  It had just enough to keep my interest from week to week and little else.  I suggest you ignore the hype and skip this anime.  If you want to see an anime about otaku that doesn\u2019t pander to them, watch Kuragehime instead.  You can thank me later.\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nI continue on my quest to explore new genres of anime and review really odd stuff. \"Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai\" roughly translates to \"I can't believe my little sister is this cute!\" I will call this title Oreimo for the rest of this review because honestly the full title is WAY too long. Much like one of my all time favorite spoof movies: Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood.\r\nOur main character is an obnoxious teenage male who is upset that his little sister doesn't bring him breakfast in bed and act likethe cutesy little sisters in the anime he likes. The little sister is loud, irritating, and all things stereo-typically \"Tsundere\". One day the elder brother discovers that his little sister is REALLY into lolicon anime and videogames along with incest, and her favorite: Lolicon/incest together. This makes the brother immediately fall in love with his little sister and try grope her while she sleeps. My reaction...WHAT!? I am an elder brother myself and if I suddenly found out my little brother was a passionate member of NAMBLA, my first reaction would NOT be....\"man, I really want to fuck my brother right now!\" Of course, our MC meets his little sister's friends who are also ridiculous otaku stereotypes and it becomes a generic harem anime only with lots of wincest and loli! Hooray! Seriously, FUCK this anime!\\n\\n\r\nSome anime are made \"by Otaku for Otaku\" to the complete exclusion of everyone else. I'm Ok with this. We all have our own likes and dislikes and not every show and movie has to be aimed at everyone. However, this anime absolutely embraces every negative stereotype about otaku and tries to pander to the lowest common denominator. I found this not only bad, but rather insultingly bad. I love anime as a medium of storytelling, but I fucking HATED this show. The parents in this show are \"big meanies\" who don't understand the joys of being an anime geek and try to negatively judge our heroes. However, I don't feel this show does a good job representing anime fans and defending us against those that dislike anime! For example, just because I like to read manga by Naoki Urosawa instead of reading comics by Stan Lee, doesn't mean I: collect hundreds of figurines, live in my parent's basement, buy hundreds of dollars worth of hentai, am a pedophile, am incestuous, or lack any semblance of social skills. Embracing these stereotypes doesn't represent our cause as anime fans or encourage others to give anime a chance! If you want to see a GOOD anime about the anti-otaku stigma in Japan and living the life of a secret otaku, watch the anime \"Welcome to the NHK!\" If OreImo was made as a satire attacking anime fans and encouraging people to NOT watch anime, it would be a crude, low blow but relatively effective. As a PRO-otaku show that acts as if it is the most wonderful, loving tribute to otaku everywhere, this show is a fucking failure!\\n\\n\r\nNow for the question you have all been asking: \"why did this piece of shit get a 2/10 instead of a 1/10?\". The answer is that the comedy in this series is so stupid it's almost funny. It isn't actually funny, but it's almost funny in the way that Tim and Eric the Awesome Show is sort of funny in that oh so popular anti-humor style. This show's relentless awkwardness that it puts the audience through and totally bizarre style of \"humor\" almost reminded me of something Andy Kaufman would do. He was a famous...\"comedian\" well known for stunts like pulling out a copy of The Great Gatsby during a stand up comedy performance and reading it aloud...and just kept going. Eventually this created some nervous laughter from the audience because it was just so awkward and they had no idea how to react...then eventually they got up and left and he just kept on reading aloud. That is basically what this anime is like. At first you sort of chuckle with nervous laughter just because it is so WTF...then eventually you realize that...this is it, this is the whole thing...so you get up and leave. Or you finish the whole series if you are a complete masochist.\\n\\n",

            "content": "'Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai' (Long titles for the win) is one of those animes I just can't figure out. On the surface it appears to be an anime about a brother and a sister who struggle to realise their feelings for each other. But in reality it is about much more than that. We have a good chunk of the story here focused on anime and the world of otakus as well as the friendships that one can gain simply by going outside and meeting new people. \r\nThat said, the plot's main purpose is to of course present us thelife of siblings who, as is often the case, display aggression and hostility towards each other but in reality care deeply for one another. \\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters, Kyosuke and Kirino Kousaka are complete opposites when it comes to their personalities. Kyosuke is a kind and mostly peaceful person who enjoys 'ordinary and average things' - his words. He also happens to be quite possibly the unluckiest person on the planet, often blamed for things he didn't do and accidents he didn't cause. Add to that the fact that he'll do anything for his unappreciative sister and you've got the perfect recipe for a martyr-type character. Indeed the suffering this character will go through in this series is immense. \\n\\n\r\nHis sister, Kirino, is a spoiled brat with a serious attitude problem, completely cold and hostile towards her brother. She's a tsundere without the dere part. She behaves similarly to other people apart from her two closest friends. This character annoyed me to no end and at times I just wanted to drop the series simply because I couldn't listen to her constant complaining and her ways of screwing up her brother's reputation in the eyes of many many people. Ironically however, her tsun( no dere) behaviour perfectly fits in with the plot in this series and without that disgustingly hostile behaviour this anime would not be complete. \\n\\n\r\nWe have a few other supporting characters of course, the tall and mysterious Saori, the intelligent and menacing Kuroneko (real name Ruri Gokou) and perhaps the most relaxing character to grace the screens of anime watchers across the world - Manami. \\n\\n\r\nKuroneko is your typical gothic style anime watcher who mostly spends her days writing novels that even native Japanese-speakers wouldn't be able to read. Her vocabulary is vast and getting in an argument with her is always going to end bad for the challenger. \\n\\n\r\nSaori is... tall. There's not much I can say about her apart from that because this series simply does not giver her enough time. From what we see we can make out that she's quite geeky and she simply enjoys spending time with her friends.\\n\\n\r\nManami is a hard working and kind person - mature beyond her years. Let me put it this way, if I was looking for a life long partner she's the person I would try to get to know better. No wonder then that Kyousuke prefers to spend every free minute he has with her. A lot of characters in this anime see them as a couple and Manami's grandfather is trying every trick in the book to push their relationship to the next level. Hilarious stuff.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is staggering. It's extremely precise and all the lines and curves are perfectly drawn. The characters look beautiful and attention has been paid to every single detail. Likewise the music is spot on and voice acting accurate and authentic. \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment part of this anime is... something I had to think hard about. On one hand if you're into the whole tsundere/martyr thing then go ahead you will enjoy this series, especially since it's very realistic. But if you get easily annoyed by one character complaining about trivial matters over and over and over again every single episode then you will definitely sit there unsatisfied and more than likely, agitated. But if you ignore that one character then this anime becomes a paradise since it also focuses on the daily struggles of otakus. That's what had me thinking the whole time, this is an anime about anime (ANIMESEPUSHION!) and also a lot of other things that go with it. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, despite Kirino's horrendous personality, I enjoyed this series. It is what it is. Don't go into it expecting it to be a masterpiece and don't take it too seriously either and you'll have fun.",

            "content": "This anime was a pleasant surprise.  It has an interesting take on the bro-sis relationship.  The two siblings treat each other like most do in the real world, with dislike, indifference, hate and of course love.  It has an intriguing plot to begin with and as the story unfolds it actually makes you care about the characters.  \r\n     I found the characters refreshing and liked how they seemed to change as the story advanced.  Most of them seemed to be more well thought out than your usual 2d run of themill stooges.  Having been limited to 15 episodes I thought they did well fleshing them out.   Though a couple could use more depth and emotion. \\n\r\n     The art work was pretty good and was what I kind of of expected in a anime of this type.  The girls looked like girls and not some barbie dolls.  I also like that they didn't revert to using childish miniatures.  The people pretty much seemed like the age they were portraying. \\n\r\n     Overall this is a funny, heartwarming, fun look at a brother and sister who are trying to figure out if they love or hate one another.  Do yourself a favor and give it a watch.",

            "content": "'Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai! (My Little Sister Can't Possibly be this Adorable!)' is about an ordinary high school student (Kyousuke), who one day discovered his usually rude and rebellious little sister (Kirino) is a closet otaku. One thing leads to another, Kyousuke ends up helping his little sister with many otaku things.\r\nAfter a quick glance at the title and plot synopsis, I thought this was some kind of incest harem comedy, and had an extremely low expectation. However, as the story progressed, a nagging thought began to dwell in my mind: \"This Show Can't Possibly be this Enjoyable!\"\r\nThe story isdriven by Kirino's selfish \"Life Consultations\" about her otaku hobby, getting her brother into all sorts of trouble. I know a lot of people are going to compare this with 'Genshiken' series, but it's quite different. 'Genshiken' focuses on different kinds of otaku, and how the protagonist fit in with fellow otaku around him. On the other hand, 'OreImo' is very much about the otaku culture seen from an average person's view, and depicts how the heroine's hobby is exposed to ordinary friends and adults around her. Most characters around Kirino represent a social group that she must seek acceptance from.\\n\\n\r\nHer brother Kyousuke is open-minded and willing to learn new things for his little sister. Members in this group are quite rare, but accept others quickly.\\n\r\nThe father is an old-fashioned conservative. Fortunately for Kirino, the dad is a reasonable man, and allows her to continue under certain conditions. It can also be said that when society is exposed to something new for a certain time, it eventually becomes a norm and become accepted.\\n\r\nThen comes Ayase, the misinformed. She's the type who believes everything she sees in TV, and forms prejudice in her mind. This type, as demonstrated in the series, can be converted with sufficient counter-evidence.\\n\r\nFinally, we have Kanako, who just despises and disgusted by otaku's creepiness... this type is probably inconvertible, but fortunately she likes to be worshipped, and otaku provide her that.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the fellow otaku friends, Saori, who tries everything but doesn't become particularly attached to anything, and then Kuroneko, who like Kirino is very passionate about a certain genre, and unwilling to budge. These characters broaden Kirino's otaku life by introducing her to new things and opinions.\\n\\n\r\nLike 'Genshiken', the story here does involves a wide range of otaku activities such as anime, eroge, live commentary, comic fest, cosplay, otagei and additionally production of fan novel and anime. I found it interesting that this show has a lot of self-reference with the anime production episode where a lot of ideas such as use of different ED and real stores as anime location, as well as the difficulty in maintaining original plots for anime adaptations. In the eroge episode, it shows the irony of Kirino's attitude toward her brother through an eroge, in which Kirino found a character very similar to her to be very annoying, and subtly realizes her own emotion. In the novel episode, it also touched on how the recent trend of moe and ecchi was degrading anime, but stated that in the end, all art works are subject of personal preferences, and there's no real \"correct\" answer.\\n\\n\r\nOne nagging question throughout the series was \"why would Kyousuke go such lengths to help his sister when she`s acting like such a bitch all the time\", but Kirino eventually became quite adorable because she`s such an earnest girl who gives 100% at everything she does.\\n\r\nKyousuke was a really likable guy who went out and got things done for his little sister, with couple of great quick thinking in critical times. The whole theme of brotherly love was beautifully summarized in the final episode. I have to admit it was sort of corny, but a fitting ending nonetheless. The irony that the one time he wasn't able to make a composed decision was in an argument with his own sister, and the reverse effect actually led to the desired result.\\n\\n\r\nAnother one may be \"why is Kirino so bitchy to her brother when he's doing so much good for her?\" Kirino is what they call \u300c\u30ae\u30e3\u30eb\u300d (Gyaru) in Japan, fashion/trend-conscious girls. One of their major characteristics is that they call their parents and brothers \u300c\u304d\u3082\u3063\u300d (Gross) or \u300c\u3046\u3056\u3063\u300d (Annoying) and avoid them because these girls don't want to be seen as a baby who still clings on to the family, or don't want to be associated with the uncool. Kirino's character is basically stereotypical gyaru who also happens to be a tsundere, therefore the constant abuse of her brother. It was apparent that her behavior was also her clumsy way of expressing her affection and need for attention from her big brother. There's also a Japanese saying \u300c\u55a7\u5629\u3059\u308b\u307b\u3069\u4ef2\u304c\u3044\u3044\u300d \"They get along so well that they fight all the time\", as in two people are so close that they don't need to hold anything back, and you wouldn't get mad at someone you don't care about. One can say the argument and even physical violence in the end was a milestone in the improvement of their relationship, especially compared to beginning of the series when Kirino outright ignored her brother.\\n\\n\r\nJust from Kirino's character setting alone, you can tell this show was never meant to be a realistic portrayal of otaku culture, as gyaru and otaku have long been depicted in media as arch-enemies of incompatible personalities.\\n\r\nAs a fantasy series, it was a really well-structured story designed to be heartwarming, building up for drama and inspiration almost every episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt work was the weakest element of the show. Neither characters nor backgrounds were usually detailed. In fact, it was noticeably cheap, but the lazy `ordinary life` atmosphere and hectic otaku madness was presented well.\\n\r\nCharacter designs are a bit heavy on moe, but quite distinguishable. I did not like how their faces were too wide in some scenes.\\n\r\nAnimation, like every other element of this show, had its moments. There are few scenes, mostly action or background had so much detail or great camera work that it takes you by surprise.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting of the siblings are done extremely well. Kirino usually sound annoying and bitchy like she should, and turn cute in dere scenes. You can just feel the emotion of her voice in touching scenes, and the squirmy perv laughs were adorable. Kyousuke's voice was smooth and easy to listen to. All other seiyuu cast were solid in my opinion, except Satou Satomi (Manami), whose high-pitch voice was overly moe and unnaturally childish for a 17-year old character.\\n\r\nThe heavy use of brass instruments in BGM was rather refreshing, but overall the music score did not leave a lasting impression. It did occasionally help set the pace for comedy or drama.\\n\r\nThe OP (song quality, suitability, visual presentation) is excellent. `Irony` by Claris itself is like a random technopop from Japanese idol group Perfume minus the auto-tune, but surprisingly catchy and appropriate in setting the mood for each episode. OP animation is always different, introducing the side characters that will appear for each episode and having same theme as the episode.\\n\r\nED songs are different for every episode, ED1-11 are selected from the public contest held in Nico Nico Douga, a Japanese video sharing website, and sang by seiyuu cast in this series. ED songs were pretty weak in general with excessive beats, but at least offer refreshment value. ED12 was written by Kousaki Satoru (who also handled BGM), and really shows the difference between pros and amateurs. ED vocals were insanely good though, especially for episode 4, 7, 8, and 11.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDespite being a late night UHF (independent station) anime about otaku, `OreImo` is very much a mainstream show designed for the general audience. I would think the more immersed in otaku culture you are, the more likely you will prefer `Genshiken` over this series because it goes far more in-depth on otaku culture.\\n\r\nHowever, this show is more of a feel-good sweet fairytale story about platonic brotherly and sisterly love. I wouldn`t go as far as saying this series is life/perspective-altering in any way, but it also sheds light on issues an otaku would face in real life, and attainment of acceptance by the general public, though a bit too much of an otaku glorification.\\n\\n\r\nIt's obvious a lot of effort was put into production, such as the revision of story structure which gave subtle character development despite the episodic format, the different \"Eye Catch\" (Cover/CD between commercials) as reference to other anime series, \"End Card\" (illustration that shows in end of the show, sometimes displayed in ED as well) drawn by various prominent manga/novel illustrators, different OP animation every episode (and sometimes use of OP in different places), and different EDs.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is not perfect as the drama feel a bit too forced at times, but it`s not about the logic... there`s something about it that really touches you. Watching this show naturally puts a smile on my face.\\n\\n\r\nI really like 'OreImo', I would even say that I LOVE it!\\n",

            "content": "Ore no Imouto is an uncommon example of a show that has fantastic production, but abominable execution. The concept is fairly original, featuring a younger sister who has a problem fitting in society as a high achieving student who is also balancing a hobby for collecting and playing imouto-themed eroge. While the show is beautiful with its detailed character/background designs, unique EDs for each episode, and decent voice acting, the show amounts to being almost completely worthless and an insult to the representation of otaku culture and the associated stigmas.\r\nLet's start off with the single worst thing about this show: Kirino.  Kirino is manythings.  She is a high achieving middle school student, a model, and an obsessive anime/eroge fan.  However above all, she is selfish, stubborn, and blatantly insensitive.  The latter qualities are something you usually give to either a villain, or anti-heroic character.  Kirino unfortunately is neither of those.  She is the heroine of the plot, and for the large part is never reprimanded for her flaws. It says little about the other characters of the story - especially her brother - when people around Kirino basically enable her unhealthy obsessions over imouto-themed eroge. For almost the entire series, Kirino is a bitch to her brother Kyousuke, who ends up becoming Kirino's bitch, slaving away to ensure Kirino gets everything she wants to feed her anime and eroge obsessions.  Is Kirino ever grateful? Not really. Up to the very last episode, she's still the same insensitive brat who wants to have her cake and eat it too, and she never truly apologizes for any of the illogically horrible things she does to her older brother.\\n\\n\r\nWhat was this show trying to accomplish?  Was this meant to be a comedy?  I didn't find it particularly funny when Kirino was kicking Kyosuke in the balls or ordering him to get run over by a truck for the sake of research. Was this meant to be a slice of life drama? Again what kind of a character would be ordering her older brother to get run over by a truck for crying out loud? Was this a tale of fantasy?  Maybe, because I sure as hell doubt that humans in the real world value villainous characters who get to have their cake and eat it too.  And yes, I do mean it when I say Kirino is villainous.  She deliberately goes out of her way to be cruel to people who help her, and she absolutely insists on having her way at all costs.\\n\\n\r\nDoes this show even do anything good?  Actually the first few episodes do manage to get your attention.  See, the concept for this show was actually decently original. There is a good number of people who would be able to relate to Kirino's problems of finding acceptance in her unusual hobbies.  Furthermore AIC is big on production values and they do a fairly impressive job of detailing some of the trips to Akihabara, conventions, cosplay contests, and a few other things. The unique EDs (and OP animations) don't hurt either.  This show really did have the framework set up to be something great.  But it's a huge insult to anime fans how despicable of a character Kirino is. Why does Kirino resent her brother so much?  Is it because she doesn't interact with him much?  Heck I have a younger sister who I interact with on an infrequent basis, and she likes anime.  But she has no reason to disdain me to the irrational extent Kirino does. And I consider myself a pretty strong anime fan, but Kirino is beyond obsessed in her collection of anime merchandise that takes up an entire closet space, and she is never grateful for all the trouble her brother goes to to add to that gigantic collection.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is a lesson to be learned from this show, it is not one about social acceptance.  More importantly, the main character of a story has to be appealing. In the end, Ore no Imouto makes many promises, but keeps none of them. By far the disappointment of Fall 2010, it is easily one of the worst shows AIC has produced by far.",

            "content": "Ore no Imouto is an entertaining and cute comedy that was thoroughly pleasant almost every moment. Those are basically the 2 things it offers, cuteness and comedy. But what makes it special is the unique brand of tsundere that the main female character, Kirino, possesses. The story is shown from the viewpoint of her brother, Kyousuke, which allows you, the viewer, to also be on the receiving end of Kirino's cuteness, which is particularly cute because of the complexity of her relationship with Kyousuke.\r\nThe main female characters look unbelievable cute, sound cute, and behave cutely, and it's a sexy-cute, not a childish cute. The cutenessdoesn't feel forced at all. It just naturally exudes from their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nI snicker and giggle the whole way through because it's very funny, just the kind of humor I love. There's no slapstick, gags, or chibi transformations, which tend to be mildly funny at best. This is quality humor.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not all humor. The experiences they have and problems they overcome feel good to watch, and they haven't felt forced so far. Rather, they are quite natural.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are wonderful. They seem very real. The main characters, Kyousuke, the brother, and Kirino, the sister, have a very believable relationship where they sort of act like they just \"tolerate\" each other, yet very much do care for each other and both know it, but coming out and saying it bluntly would be embarrassing. It's really a very common type of sibling rivalry/relationship.\\n\\n\r\nUnderstanding this relationship is key to your enjoyment of the show. It seems many viewers don't understand this and so they think that Kirino is an unrealistically ungrateful bitch and her brother unrealistically puts up with it without complaint. But ironically, if you understand that they are really just pretending to only just \"tolerate\" each other, but really care about each other, this is what makes the show very unique and realistic. And it's why Kirino is so darn cute. So try to understand this while watching, and look for the hidden message or vibe that Kirino is sending even when she acts angry, and never take her \"mean\" act literally.\\n\\n\r\nKyousuke is a great character, and seems to act just how I would want him to act. He's cool, reliable, sharp, and witty. Kirino is a tsundere-type character, but doesn't seem at all like a cliche. Kyousuke will sacrifice himself for his sister, which makes for some great moments as it breaks down Kirino \"defenses\" and forces her to acknowledge her brother's sacrifices with a grudging but sincere \"thanks\".  The other characters have strong personalities as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe colors in the animation are bold and detailed, and camera angles and viewpoints are always keeping it fresh. The music complements the scenes very well, often breaking into the great \"theme song\" during feel-good resolutions of Kirino's problems when both Kyousuke and the viewers are rewarded with Kirino's cute fighting spirit or her grudging show of gratitude. It actually feels on par with an epic climatic scene in some lengthy drama.\\n\\n\r\nTowards the end of the series, there were some things I didn't like. The transition from one scene to another was sometimes very sudden, and some details that were important for the next scene were not sufficiently explained, almost like they were short on time and had to condense things. This happens in the last two episodes. In fact, the climatic moment in the final episode is extremely sudden, has no foreshadowing that I can see leading up to it, isn't clear whether it is intentional or accidental on the part of Kirino, and leaves me to have to wonder and speculate about what Kirino's thought's were leading up to the moment. I feel like Kirino should have shown signs that she was dealing with a tough dilemma, then we would then wonder what it was, and then the climatic moment would provide the answer. But as it is, it just leaves me puzzled.\\n\\n\r\nBut overall, this was one of my favorite shows. It was hilarious, cute, and the best part is the unique personality of Kirino that is full of cute subtleties which I can easily relate to. Not your typical tsundere.",

            "content": "Believe me when I say to you, this is not what you were expecting. I've found brother-sister anime to be all either A: incestuous, or B: Completely boring. Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai takes the brand new option C: Incredible. I consider myself to watch things that have a decent amount of quality to them. I don't like to waste my time watching things that end up wasting my time. After reading the description of this anime, I brushed it aside. However, after taking notice that there was quite a bit of support for the anime, I changed my mind oneboring Tuesday afternoon and downloaded the first three episodes. By the end of the first episode, I was completely immersed in the engaging storyline and the complex characters. Rarely does an anime bring me into the world of its characters, and rarely do I find myself connecting on a personal level with characters in the anime. I won't waste your time: if you're already interested in this anime, watch it. You don't even need to read the rest of this review. I'll say it right now: you're in for a real treat today.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\\n\r\nWhen I first read the description here on MAL, I was skeptical. Very skeptical. Slice of life anime doesn't always have the most engaging plot structure. It tends to lack a definite climax, and often times, it seems like there's a lot left unresolved. However, Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai (further referenced as Ore no Imouto) was different. The first episode immerses you into its storyline, pulling you into its characters and plot, and each successive episode only serves to pull you in deeper. What was wonderful about this anime was its humor. Simply put, the story is about the strengthening of the bond between a brother and sister. The humor in this anime comes from the relationship a brother and a sister have, and, at times, the boundaries that are set by a society for a brother and sister. The story progresses as the main character's younger sister needs his help more and more. I won't give any sort of definite summary in this review. All I want to say is that the story moves continuously, there is no junk anywhere in this anime. Furthermore, the storyline is more than engaging enough to keep anyone entertained. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nI didn't find the artwork to be all too impressive. However, it was plainly effective for what it set out to do. However, I would like to comment on the work that was done within anime of other fictional animes. Throughout the anime, there are other anime that appear as part of the interests of certain characters. The illustrators of Ore no Imouto did a fabulous job distinguishing the different tastes between Kirino and Kuroneko (Ruri). The contrast between these two characters made by the artwork shown in the anime that they watch greatly adds to the impression given to the reader that they're both crazy otaku, with wildly different tastes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nI personally found no enjoyment out of the audio in this anime. While it wasn't terrible, it wasn't just outstanding. It fit the anime, which is of course what was important, but it couldn't stand up to the level of artistic intuition of the other 3 categories. It just wasn't there. There wasn't a place to put it even. Not that I can complain. The entire anime is consumed with substantial dialogue that really makes it what it is.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters make this anime what it is. The characters in this anime are perfectly matched to create the perfect story. In my opinion, story is nothing without characters. The characters perfectly meld together to form interesting situations, which result in multiple laugh out loud moments. I think most people will agree that they don't laugh to themselves very often when they watch an anime. I laughed quite a few times, but at other times, this anime can capture your heart, because again, the relationship between a brother and a sister can become quite emotional. This is seen towards the end of the anime, and it is very emotional. Kyousuke Kousuka, played by Yuuichi Nakamura is the perfect older brother for this anime. By far my favorite character, his sarcastic commentary and his use of logic contrast brilliantly with his little sister's illogical and child-like desires, which seemingly have no bounds and which is he almost forced to accept. And that's just two of the characters. And normally, that's what you get out of an anime. The main characters are good, but usually, your supporting actors and actresses are a little boring. I loved several of the supporting characters in this anime, and I wish they could have made it longer so that their part in the story and their relationship with the main character could be made more definite, especially the Kyousuke and Kirino's friends, Akagi, Manami, and Ayase.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nDespite what the anime lacked, I really enjoyed it. I don't think any sort of review will truly do this anime justice. This is easily one of the most humorous anime I have ever seen, with a witty and clever take on the relationship between a brother and sister. The anime kept its focus, and thereby keeps its viewers interested in the storyline and wanting more. The only problem I had with this anime was that it actually ended with only 12 episodes. Such a wonderful anime should have gone on longer, however I am definitely satisfied with the impact it left me. \\n\\n\r\nJust a few concluding remarks: I'd like to say this is not a ecchi incestuous anime. Although it at times hints towards that kind of anime, and although eroge does play a part in this anime, it is not actually between the two main characters. This anime seriously examines what it means to have a sibling, and the implications involved. This anime is truly something to be enjoyed for its outlook on the responsibilities of an older brother to his younger sister, and what it truly means to be there, selflessly sacrificing yourself, when someone really needs you.\\n",

I especially like the parents, they seem more real than the eccentric-type parents that often show up in this kind of anime.  I also like the fact that they don't really design the little sister (Kirino) to be really sexy, and even point out her affection for the imooto-ero games is pure, which makes the anime a lot more comfortable to watch.  I hope its not like Kiss X Sis, that one weirded me out.\r\nI'd agree with the last reviewer, the series has a lot of potential.Most of the really funny stuff was during the end credits, and if that's any indication of the season, I can't wait for more.",

            "content": "Sisters. They can sure be a pain, and I know based on experience. They might cause you trouble and make you unhappy at times, but they really don't want that deep down. This seems to be the case in Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai (My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute), but maybe it was taken a little too far. I'll explain later.\r\nStory: 6\r\nLet me go over the story real quick. Kyousuke finds an eroge game in a DVD case. Kirino talks with him and reveals her hidden side; she's goes gaga for little sister eroges. Kyousuke decides to help herout with \"life counseling\" sessions to get her to open up with her secret hobby. I'm not gonna lie, it's an interesting story, to say the least. I mean we can all relate. We have secrets we might not want others to know. The problem for me is that it felt stereotypical and predictable. It had some twists near the end. but for the most part, I knew what was going to happen. Speaking of the ending, I thought it was quite sudden, which seemed forced to fit into the 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nI'm not gonna say much about this. Nothing spectacular. Quite generic. The end.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nI wasn't impressed by the sound used. The OP and EDs are forgettable. I honestly can't remember much that stood out at all. Oh well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nThis is what made me really dislike this show. I don't care what anybody says; I hate Kirino with a passion so strong, it can only be compared to the force of a thousand suns. She was utterly useless for nearly the entirety of the series. I guess this is a little biased, because I hate people who care only about themselves, but that's just me. To me, she's a terrible person. She's not the only problem. Kyousuke, for example. He bland and boring. He has his moments, but they're scarce. This show has good characters though, like Manami and her grandfather. The problem is that they barely get any screen time, especially the grandfather who's only in one episode. Kuroneko and Saori are pretty alright characters as well, but they can't save the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a story that had potential. It could have gone deeper, explaining the difficult relationship between Kyousuke helping Kirino accept the she has a hobby that she can't keep secret forever, but instead, we get a whiny sister and a boring brother doing stereotypical otaku things. I guess they really tried to appeal to otakus and weeaboos.",

            "content": "I can't help but feel this show got a little to mainstream for it's own good, hopefully without descending into a rant this show has evidently been watched by many users who knew full well they had no fondness for this sort of show going into it.\r\nOre no Imouto is at times nothing short of brilliant. While not quite up there with shows like Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu, when contrasted with more standard efforts like Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu this show it truly special. \r\nOur story follows Kyousuke who inadvertently stumbles across his seemingly perfect younger sister Kirino's secret obsession with little sister's (in gamesand anime). He reluctantly chooses to support her and they progressively grow closer through Kirino's hobby.\\n\r\nIt's not the greatest idea for a story, especially straight off the back of Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu which had little else going for it bar the novelty of the idea. The premise does serve to give the show an excuse to delve around Otaku culture and scenario's it would other wise struggle to incorporate into this sort of show.\\n\\n\r\nDepending on your tolerance and standards there is allot of subtle, or at times not so subtle fan service in this show, the character models are distinct and fantastically realised, the backgrounds are rich and vivid, the whole experience is visually cheerful and vibrant. If you hold this up against pretty much any comedy it's right up there with the best of them animation wise.\\n\r\nThe sound track complements the cheery atmosphere of the show well, i wasn't overly fond of the dramatic score they used for every dramatic scene, it seemed a little over the top at times. The voice acting was first rate, again distinctive injecting genuine individuality into a first rate cast of characters, production values are something to rave about here, AAA standard all the way.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters for this show are truly exceptional, i'd rate the supporting cast as the best i've ever come across in a show bar none, all this considering i didn't especially like Kirino at any point in the show. Kyousuke can be compared with the Kyon's and the Tomoya Okazaki's of anime, exactly the same mold slightly sarcastic darkly likeable male lead. Kirino is loud, bold, spoilt and dominant, not my favourite among the female cast by some distance, but her personality is necessary to drive the story forward. \\n\r\nSupporting cast member's Ayase, Kanako, Saori, Ruri even Kiriko's father, are simplly first rate, my only complaint would be they didn't get more combined screen time, an excellent mix of weird and wonderful characters who often overshadow the leads.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment wise for all my positiveness there were a good few episodes that were genuinely tedious, the episode they spent pitching an anime to studio execs springs to mind fairly quickly. This should not detract from the good 75% of brilliant material, many genuinely laugh out loud moments, a fantastic pacing and energy to the whole experience and a surprisingly good spread of themes, episode styles and character face time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it is a crime in my eyes that both the front page reviews score this show to be 1 point above an average show, this was easily among the best shows in what was an especially strong season, and one of the better slice of life comedies you could hope to come across, do not be put off this is one of the easiest watches you will come across.",

Plus, everything about this anime just screams \"hentai doujinshi fodder\".\r\nPutting that aside, I gave this series a chance because I was attracted by the beautiful animation and cute character designs and I was actually pleasantly surprised. \r\nAlthough there are some questionable camera shots of Kirino from Kyosuke's point of view (for the fanboys, I suppose), their overall relationship remains sibling-like and both characters are thoroughly put off by anything more than that. I'm notsure how this will develop in later episodes/chapters but so far it hasn't really set off any \"creepy/gross!\" alarms.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I enjoyed most (besides beautiful animation) is the humor. I chuckled at several scenes (I really enjoyed Kyosuke's \"Kick her off the bed!\" selection in the eroge game, mostly because that's what any REAL big brother would choose).\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I can't say this is an anime for everyone, cause there really are some truly crazy creepy people out there that would read way into Kyosuke and Kirino's relationship...I would advise those people to stay away (please). Otherwise, it's a heartwarming story about a big brother protecting/supporting his little sis (and who doesn't just find that adorable, even in real life?).",

            "content": "Ore no Imouto or My Little Sister Can't be this Cute is quite possibly one of the most deceptive anime I have ever seen.\r\nInitially I stayed away from this show because I was quite weary of the rather ludicrous premise and the title made me think I was in for another incest anime. However, like any other hyped anime, sometimes one just has to see what is the deal with the popularity.\r\nFirst of all, I'll admit that the initial episodes showed promising signs. My fears of this turning into some sort of incestual fetish anime were dispelled almost immediately, and better yet, the premise whilerather ridiculous was merely a vehicle for a much more well grounded and relateable plot. At the beginning of the show, our main protagonist Kyousuke is seen to be in a rather broken relationship with his younger sister Kirino until, by accident, discovers that his sister is an closet otaku who apparently loves eroge games involving little sisters. The later confrontations over this fact would later lead to Kyousuke getting involved in his sister's secret lifestyle, and it is quite possible for this once broken sibling relationship to make amends over the glorious hobbies of an otaku.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all this, my initial positive impression of this show would quickly go down the drain. The show which initially presented itself both seriously and earnestly, became very dishonest. I really was tricked into thinking that they'd treat the otaku issues at least semi-seriously. The way those around her accept her as is puts me in utter disbelief. What was the point of her hiding her hobby in the first place if it was going to seem so easy to get more out in the open with it?\\n\\n\r\nI should have honestly seen the warning signs. Why of course, not only is our otaku in this show a moe bait girl, but she is also presented as absolutely perfect in anything she does. It's both hard to sympathize and care for the character Kirino when almost everything always works out for her.This is further exasperated by the protagonist and side character's willingness to be at her beckon call whenever a problem does arrive.\\n\\n\r\nIt is quite apparent by at least the mid point of this show, that all Ore no Imouto truly wanted to be was some clever marketing scheme to create an otaku wish fulfillment fantasy anime. If there is one thing that I do not appreciate in anime, it is being patronized by the creators of a show. And my god, this show was certainly an insult to my intelligence.\\n\\n\r\nI say this of course without even mentioning just how insufferable Kirino is. Tsundere is the sort of trope where if you execute it well, you probably have a decent character in your grasp, but if you make a mess out of it, you get Louise from ZnT, and trust me, that's not a good thing...\\n\\n\r\nThere are not many shows where the mere presence of one character seems to drag down the rest of the cast with them. Each and every character is bashed to death with the stupid stick anytime a situation with Kirino arises, in particular the main character Kyousuke. The only saving grace in the cast ever being the goth lolita charcter Kuroneko (They should just a spin off series about her). Hey even I admit that she's a bitch, but at least she's a bitch I can find amusing and sympathize with. There's absolutely nothing sympathetic about the character Kirino. She expresses belligerent behavior to those around her, especially her brother, without consequence and we're supposed to sit here and laugh.\\n\\n\r\nThis is merely another breaking point in my suspension of disbelief (As if I hadn't reached that threshold already to some degree) for this anime. One cannot simply accept that a brother, Kyousuke, who supposedly hates his sister, would go to hell and back for a sister that shows anything but kindness to him. It just doesn't make sense. Either Kyousuke is one of the greatest saints I have seen in fiction or the writing here is just terrible and breaks characterization. To say the least, it's not enjoyable to watch either way.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up without ranting too much about this trash series... If you dislike tsunderes, stay away. If you dislike otaku-wish fulfillment animes, stay away. If you are looking for a real down to earth exploration of a sibling relationship. I repeat, stay away.\\n\\n\r\nAll we have here is an otaku wish fulfillment anime centralized around a Mary Sue character. If that is something you enjoy, go ahead. Otherwise, you have been warned.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "[Please take note that I watched all the 15 episodes of this anime, so this review is based also on those special episodes and on the real ending].\r\nOtaku activity, like watching anime and especially playing eroges is usually viewed to be a hobby of a young adult males that are a little outcast. Surely, there's no way that a model middle schooler could do things like that.\r\nOr is there a way? Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai is an anime that tells you a story of a high schooler named Kyousuke Kousaka. His relationship with his sister named Kirino Kousaka ispretty troublesome, and the anime centers around that relationship. I have always liked sister & brother stories, and on top of that the anime also involves a lot of otaku culture in it. Kirino is a top achiever in her school, great athlete and also a model. And, when no one sees, she also plays eroge games and watches anime. One night, she shows her secret to his brother and asks for a life counselling. The idea itself is pretty unique to me, and from the start this anime seemed to be very funny. The story itself is not bad, but what I really liked was the characters, Kirino is a a character that you want to hug tightly, but at the same time you want to beat him to death. It seems like she is your usual tsundere, but I think she is more than that. Kirino's father is an old fashioned man that has no tolerance for things like eroge. And her mother is your typical kind mother. The only character which I didn't like that much is, surprisingly, the main character. Kyousuke could have had some balls to stand up against his sister. Their relationship works fine this way also, but I would have wanted to see him getting really mad at Kirino some times.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhen you put this setting into action, you can't have a bad anime. Kyousuke's and Kirino's relationship is one very interesting thing, It's like you are waiting for them to either kill each other or commit something that is also illegal at any point. It doesn't help that Kirino also plays eroges that have the objective of charming your own little sister, the sibling complex is there all the time, kinda lurking in the shadows when Kirino acts all tsundere and I love it. But there's no way that Kirino would ever look her brother that way right, it would be gross! However, in her games it's not. At the same time Kyousuke just tries to not give a fuck and just help his sister. When you mix this up with very tight dad that has no understanding for anything like that, you get very comical and enjoyable anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe otaku culture is also very relevant in this anime. Part of this anime deals with problems that one faces when prejudged based on his hobby. You play eroges, so you are a gross human being. This anime really tries to break that and teach you that any thing that brings you such joy and unifies people like that can't be that bad. At least I saw a meaning like that behind this anime, which is a nice thing. In the end, it's just a hobby, but all people don't understand that. That plus Kirino's and Kyousuke's relationship really made this anime worthwhile. I must also mention that is was funny to see her playing those eroges, since I have played some myself and all those things that happen in that anime regarding that are very true. Anyone who watches anime can relate himself to this story and feel accepted.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending changes every episode, and there is not even one bad ending there, I liked them all. On top of that, I loved The opening. The art seems to be your normal modern style art, very bright colors that actually do fit very well in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was very funny and at the same time very interesting anime that still didn't forget to convey some kinda message through you. You won't waste your time watching this.",

            "content": "NOTE: The anime is called \u201cOre no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai\u201d or \u201cMy Little Sister Can\u2019t Be This Cute\u201d. However, it will be referred to as \u201cOreimo\u201d in this review for convenience.\r\nThe Good:\r\n-Great animation and voice acting\r\n-Not afraid to poke fun at its own stereotypes\r\n-Great cast of colourful characters\r\nThe Bad:\r\n-Great cast doesn\u2019t have enough time in the limelight\r\n-Most of the story progression is only in the first half\r\n-Seems too short for what it sets out to do\r\nSynopsis:\r\nThe plot focuses on 17-year old Kousaka Kyousuke and his 14-year old sister Kirino. As they were growing up, Kyousuke and Kirino\u2019s relationship was pretty muchnon-existent, and besides occasionally exchanging pleasantries and arguing, they stayed out of each other\u2019s way. One day, Kyousuke discovers a case for a Magical Girl anime called \u201cStardust Witch Meruru\u201d and wonders where it came from. Upon opening the case, he discovers a DVD for an adult hentai game. He is dumbfounded and has no idea where it came from. He later discovers that both the DVD case and the game belong to Kirino. Later that night, Kirino calls Kyousuke into her room and reveals that she is an otaku and has an extensive collection of anime and adult hentai DVDs that she had been collecting in secret and hiding from her family. However, Kirino struggles with her hobby because she knows how much otaku are looked down upon by society, and so she implores Kyousuke to help her come to terms with her hobby and to help her find friends with similar interests. Kyousuke doesn\u2019t understand much about the hobby or about what\u2019s going on, but he reluctantly agrees to help Kirino.\\n\\n\r\nThe main thing I liked about Oreimo is that is isn\u2019t exaggerated in any way, as far as human interaction goes. It is firmly planted in reality and never tries to stray from it. This doesn\u2019t mean everything that takes place in it takes place every day in real life, however; Kirino\u2019s relationship with her hobby is soon apparent to be somewhat exaggerated, perhaps in an attempt to explain to casual anime viewers that being an otaku is just as much a hobby as any other. On the same token, though Kirino\u2019s hobby is a mainstay in her lifestyle, she is still firmly planted in reality, and even has a job as a model to pay for the games and anime she buys. Kyousuke\u2019s character, I found, is even moreso planted in reality. He doesn\u2019t have a full grasp on his sister\u2019s hobby and the way she acts, and he even shows fear of his sister, only standing up to her in dire situations.  Though Kirino was the one who implored Kyousuke to help her with her struggles, she often implies she doesn\u2019t enjoy his company, even though she consistently forces him to spend time with her. Oreimo is a comedy through and through, and even with that said, it is wholly injected with a  healthy dose of reality.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some things I disliked about Oreimo, however. It is only twelve episodes long. I feel like that really isn\u2019t long enough for the show to do what it sets out to do. There is a twist, however; Episode 12 is only an \u201calternative\u201d ending. From my understanding, there will be a \u201ctrue\u201d ending released with the BD/DVD release of the anime. At the time of this writing, it\u2019s not out yet, but I\u2019m sure they will be made available shortly after release. I found this to be a unique twist on an otherwise underwhelming ending, and I\u2019ll definitely be interested in seeing it when released.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I disliked is that most of its story progression only happens in the first half of the anime, while not a whole lot happens in the second half other than character interaction. This isn\u2019t always a bad thing; sometimes the story set-up is more than enough to carry the show for the rest of its run. However, I sort of wished the story went a bit farther than it did.\\n\\n\r\nAll of this said, Oreimo is a hilarious take on a very real situation, and it is probably the best anime of the fall. I highly recommend it if you love comedy.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Rating: 9/10\\n",

            "content": "I thing I love about anime and manga (though I don't really read manga) is its ability not to take itself too seriously and the way it pokes fun of the extreme otaku's especially the grown men who are into magical girl anime. You know who you are!\r\nOre no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai is a gem of an anime and something a lot of anime fans can relate to as in no one really understands why we watch it.\r\nThe story follows Kyousuke Kousaka, a Mr Average, who doesn't excel or suck at anything. His little sister Kirano on the other hand isbrilliant at everything, school, sports and is even a model. What's more they don't get on. However, Kousaka discovers that Kirano has a big secret, she is a hardcore otaku for magical anime and sister love eroge. Despite their differences and not understanding why she is into what she's into he agrees to keep her secret and helps take her first steps in to otaku culture where they both make new friends.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty I began watching Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai with a bit of trepidation after reading the synopsis as I feared the brother and sister would become lovers. I am pleased to say this never materialised. Instead the main aspect of the story is the building of the normal brother and sister relationship of Kousaka and Kirano which they never had before. This is also a harem anime, however, although there are romantic opportunities for Kousaka he is actually despised by one or two of the female characters so we don't have to endure the usual harem anime jokes. The comedy in Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai is very good and I did find myself laughing out loud on many occasions.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the many of the characters. Kousaka is a good central character, essentially plays the straight man and being the butt of may of the jokes. He is also a great older brother suffering at the hands of a bratish and stubborn little sister who struggles to appreciate what her brother does for her. Kirano is a character you will like in the end or hate. Her bratish personality is deliberate and essential to the story which makes watching her get over herself all the more better. \\n\\n\r\nBecause Kousaka plays the straight man it enables the other characters to shine. The most interesting of all is the cosplaying Kuroneko who represents the anime fans who watch anime to escape for a while their normal lives. We also find out a little, but just enough to get us interested, of the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nOre no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai was never going to be a masterpiece but is an enjoyable and fun comedy yet able to sentimental without being mushing. Well worth watching.",

            "content": "Most people don't seem to understand that this is an anime, and therefore isn't really intending to accurately portray real life. Most critiques I have seen so far of Ore no Imouto are \"My friend told me to watch it because he/she said it was really good, but it was just some anime catering to the otakus of the industry\". Reviewer then proceeds to either make fun of otakus, or even more amusing, says why this anime is actually... just an anime! An anime being anime-like? Taboo.\r\nOre no Imouto takes a cliche school / slice of life anime setup and sets it at a newangle. Sure, some of the character designs are stereotypical, but they're all created that way to convey a certain feeling to the audience. That feeling, at least in the anime (because I highly suspect the original was romantic love) is actually sibling or familial love. To break it down for those of you who still think Ore no Imouto is cliche: I don't know of any other anime that really discusses sibling love in a more mature light than this one.\\n\r\nPeople complain about Kyousuke being a wimp, and for the most part, he definitely appears to seem like one. However, consider his father, who is actually portrayed somewhat realistically. As a sibling myself, I can clearly see how the iron fist of a father's control over something that is your favorite hobby could really lead the siblings to come together and make amends for their past.\\n\\n\r\nAnother argument people have against Ore no Imouto is the \"girl who loves eroge\" cliche/catering to otakus. While it could be seen in this light, I saw it as the stereotypical anime exaggeration that we see everywhere, in order to make an important point. We see Kyousuke fighting for his sister's rights to appreciate and enjoy her own hobby at her own leisure without being judged by others around her. It's a wonderful message to send across, despite it being moved by the eroge factor. However, it's the very fact that Kirino's hobby is eroge that shows if Kyousuke can justify this hobby to those around him, any hobby can be justified, and in general, any action that does not harm anyone else.\\n\r\nIt sends a message to those radically in opposition of hobbies that others have, and a general message of acceptance. Kirino, by the end of the series, seems to be hated by many viewers for what she has done to Kyousuke. Part of that appears to be intentional, as it leaves the audience wondering \"How can Kyousuke put up with all of the crap Kirino does to him?\" \\n\r\nIt's true, it seems unbelievable, and is highly unlikely in today's world. But since when has anime ever tried to accurately portray reality? Most of us watch anime because it glorifies simple personalities and relationships between people, transforming them into something wonderful. We watch it because it gives us an escape into a world that we enjoy watching, or may even want to live in, because it is so radically emotionally different than our world. \\n\\n\r\nIt seems that some people are forgetting the magic of anime that led all of us to watch it in the first place. Ore no Imouto is, quite secretively, one of the more poignant animes of Fall 2010, and was a true joy to watch.",

Then I started rewatching it, and I was completely wrong.\r\nStory - 10\r\nThe story has a very unique plot that I've never seen in any other anime, which is about a girl named Kirino Kousaka who is obsessed with cute eroge games. She goes through her life hiding a huge amount of eroges with the help of her brother Kyousuke Kousaka, although they don't get along very well.\r\nArt - 10\r\nEven before I saw the anime, Iwas really captivated with the artwork. I think the eyes are extremely well done, not just because they give off a lot of emotion, but I love the style. It's clean-cut, and very detailed aswell, such as the styling of the hair, shine on the eyes, blush on the face, and folds and shading in the clothing.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\\n\r\nThe voices for the characters are perfect, each fitting each of the characters idealy. They're also very well done. Whichever emotion the character has, and depending on what she or he is doing, the seiyuu fits it accurately and makes it believable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\\n\r\nI LOVE the characters! All of them are very likeable, despite their differences. I particularly like the way they act around each other, as they don't all get along too well, so it's enjoyable to watch how each of them respond to each others' actions. They're all very cute and I love them all, but Kirino is my favorite~\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall - 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed ever part of this anime very much. Everything was perfect, and I couldn't ask for any more or any less. I loved everything about it and it was really fun and entertaining to watch, so I give it all a big 10! \\n\\n\r\nI don't know if everyone will like it as much as me, but I recommend it to everyone~! :D",

            "content": "IMO, this anime is mediocre at best. People at general seem to like it, but maybe I just don't see its full potential. I do like the ending.\r\nKyosuke, the male lead is a doormat. He suffers from apathy, and who can blame him? Putting with all the shit his little sister does. He is basically a slave to her problems and desires and has none of his own. Yes, he gets some affection - but hell, for all the effort he is putting in that's insane. We can't put all the blame on his sister, he is a pushover.\r\nKirino, the female lead. I hate hercharacter. She is basically a tsundere on steroids. The entire story revolves around her problems of being a model and a closet otaku and how her \"big brother\" helps her out. Its not as much helping out as it is pure slavery. She drags him doing shit he doesn't want, puts responsibility on him to deal with her things.. Nonsense drama. \\n\\n\r\nSupposedly the anime is great because of how real the interaction between brother/sister are and how they go from step one to uncover their true feelings. That's all good and that's the hook of the anime. I don't like the way Kyosuke acts. He is way too much of a doormat and a pushover and the entire anime is about that. How can an anime be about revealing feelings when the male lead doesn't take any action or reveal any feelings to the bullshit he is facing? Nonsense drama, that's how.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great though. Very well drawn. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend it and don't at the same time. But that's just my view on it. \\n",

            "content": "\"This anime can't be any good!\" is what I thought at first, but the name, I mean the context, is absolutely misleading.\r\nSTORY: I have to say, this anime probably slapped alot of people in the face if they expected another run of the mill ecchi, moe, and or even incest anime. Well my face has a big red hand print on it.\r\nThe very beginning shows a cute girl trying to wake her older brother, Kyosuke Kosaka telling him she has done nice gestures like fixing him breakfast, just like another ecchi/harem/moe/whatever else belongs there typical anime, but instead her brother becomes angry saying my sisteris never this nice, you're a fake, and \"My little sister can't be this cute!\"\\n\r\nThat was only a dream and that is only like the first one or two minutes of the first episode, and he's right, I don't think anyone would think she's actually that \"cute\" as I learned as I continued to watch this anime, and I just can't help but to feel punk'd haha.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, this is a slice of life anime about Kyosuke and his little, and seemingly perfect in many ways sister, Kirino Kosaka, who is also an otaku (Or what I should say is that she is a closet otaku) who has quite the collection of little sister themed anime and game, mostly inappropriate ones that she keeps them a secret from everyone except Kyosuke who finds out about it (Because apparently up until this point, she was rather good at hiding her hobby from her friends and family).\\n\r\nThe story and plot are kinda thin, like most slice of life anime, but it's about Kyosuke trying to be suportive of Kirino's hobby as an older brother (The best comparison to their relationship would be how the characters  from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya act towards each other; Kyon and Haruhi), but she proves to be the drama case with the two arguing alot and Kirino almost unbearable attitude towards her brother. \\n\r\nBut honestly I believe a lot of anime fans are going to sympathise with Kirino about being an otaku/anime fan and doesn't want anyone to find out cause she feels that her hobby will damage her image that she has established in her social life and her friends. \\n\r\nWhile other (Well most) viewers of this anime will just think she's a terrible excuse of an anime character, but that's the impression I get from her character. \\n\r\nMore characters appear later on, mostly fellow otaku who seemingly are based on sterotype anime fandom personalities, the somewhat gothic tsundere girl who often argues with Kirino, Ruri Goko (aka Kuroneko) and the obvious stereotype otaku looking girl, Saori Makishima.\\n\r\nIt's a very nice paced story that never goes into the incest line that the title almost screams at you\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: Very well animated with excellent character designs, it's nothing awe inspiring, but it's much better than most would've expected.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The background music is really plain, and sometimes sounds like it belonged from some unremarkable harem/ecchi anime. \\n\r\nThe voice acting is pretty good, especially Kyosuke's Seiyuu, though I can't really say cause I'm often too busy reading the subtitles. \\n\r\nThe opening theme is very catchy pop song, Irony, while the ending theme usually changes in every episode, each one offering okay music.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: \\n\r\n+ A better anime than it's name suggests\\n\r\n+ Great animation and excellent character designs\\n\r\n+ Doesn't become a creepy incest anime like the title suggests\\n\r\n- Nothing special audio\\n\r\n- The sister character is easy to hate\\n\\n\r\nDespite it's name, this anime is much better than most slice of life anime out there, especially if you were expecting another harem/ecchi/moe/whatever anime.\\n\\n\r\nSECOND OPINION: (Updated: April 26, 2011)\\n\r\nLooking back on what I said, though it was refreshing, the series has a couple of flaws.\\n\r\n*The main character is sort of an idiotic tool, and has the personality of a blank sheet of paper, my comparison to Kyon (The main male character of the haruhi series) is kinda loose.\\n\r\n*Kirino is actually a little too easy to hate, though the part of her that's okatu is relate-able, her overall character is annoying as hell.\\n\r\n*The background music is actually worse than what I said it was.\\n\r\n*Not enough development for other characters, especially Saori Makishima, who receives an interesting character twist in the final episodes.\\n\r\n*Despite it not being an incest anime, there's, unfortunately,  a lot of incest overtones in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSECOND OPINION SCORE:\\n\r\nSTORY: 7\\n\r\nART: 8\\n\r\nSOUND: 6\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 6\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7\\n\\n\r\nIt's still a fun anime, but it's not as good as I first felt about it.\\n\r\nBut I still like it and I would still recommend it to other fans of slice of life anime.",

Currently it hasn't had enough time for a development in the plot for it is only the first episode. However, it has done a good introduction of characters though between the brother and sister and their lifestyle. This anime has great potential for the paradox ( the younger sister being an otaku and playing little sister games) has the ability to become a great comedy. I'm looking forward to the next episode.\r\n- Nekocrisis_562802\r\nNow continuation of my review we go forth to episode 2 of theseries. Now, in the prior episode the audience got the introduction of the characters and the plot of the series(of course they did it was the first episode). This episode elaborated on the way others think negatively/less highly  of otakus. During this episode it showed how society views otakus and that truly gave depth to the plot because in the first episode we caught sight of this from the protagonists' parents,especially the father.\\n\r\nThis was a good development for it gave us more reasons to support the Main characters. Well, the plot has grown but with improvements on one thing one loses something, episode 2 didnt have as much comedy as the first episode. Although there could have been a great comedy scene during Kyousuke Kousaka's awkward moment. Well I'll let you make your own decisions on the matters. Well all in all it still was entertaining and looking forward to episode 3.\\n\r\n-Nekocrisis_562802 \\n",

            "content": "This Anime isn't anything new or original and it is not anything great, but it is a nice show with a tiny bit of drama but made up no mostly comedy and some cuteness thrown in for good measure. Its about a little sister who secret of being an Anime/Manga/Visual Novel otaku is leaked to her brother, and from then on its all Kyousuke the older brother helping her out with 'Life Couselling' as she has to deal with the secret being known to there parent, old friends and how she comes to know some new friends with the same interest.\r\nThere are a lot ofparts of this show that we see quite often, the brother sister bond, now this show doesn;t do what a lot of shows do, there isn't any romance, its about them becomeing closer as family. Another thing is the otakuness about keeping her secret and is nothing we haven't seen in Nogizaka Haruka, there are even those fan clubs with the uniform we see often.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for this show is really nice, it doesn't stand out as anything flashy but its use of soft tones really make it a relaxing show. The characters are well drawn and although it does use the cliche of having odd hair colors it doesn't go overboard with it and it doesn't stand out too much. Animation is genrally smooth an there arn't any huge pointers that spoil it.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is ok, the opening song is fun to listen to but i guess is a little generic, the ending though has a different song after each episode wich i quite nice as it add a little extra after you finished watching just to see what will play, each though is mostly a fun bubbly song sung by the seiyu of Kirino. The voice actors all do a good job, no one sounded forced and was always natural sounding but other than that it didn't stand out.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are great, Kyousuke is a great character, he's stoic but not all the time as his patience with Kirino is tested and can probably be compared to Kyon, though not as cool, and although reluctant he always gives a helping hand to Kirino. Kirino can be rather tsundere, she gets all embaressed when trying to thank her brother or gets all giggle when playing eroge, she can be rather cute at certain poits which i guess is one of the Animes selling points. The friends Kuroneko and Saori offer a different perspective, Kuroneko dresses in gothic lolita style clothing and seems to reference the world as a demonic fantasy type place, but she is willing to offer help as seen in various episodes. Saori is the super geek type, dressed rather guy like with thick glasses but throughout the show we are teased with the fact she has a different life style of an Ojou. Kirino and Kyousukes parents are very strict on her otaku habits and dislike it a lot but come to accept it, there father is extremly tsundere which is very amusing. All other side characters are all different and funny especially Manami's grandfather.\\n\\n\r\nThe shows main theme is family. A brother and sister starting off as rather distant siblings but through various activities they become closer as siblings should. It offers a decent amounto of comedy and slice of lide all the while being cute. definitely a show that should be watched.",

            "content": "Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai is an anime from AIC BUILD based on a light novel by Fushimi Tsukasa. I've heard a bit about it and it could potentially be... Actually, no. I may be putting my foot in my mouth here, since I write the opening paragraphs before watching the actual anime, but there's no conceivable way this is going to be good. It's a harem series with a title that roughly translates to \"My Little Sister can't be this cute.\" That just reeks of incest and sleaze. I'm really not looking forward to this one, but when oneof my lovely fans asks me to review something, I do try to do so. Let's just get this over with. \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a teenager with a sister complex named Kyousuke. I will be simply referring to him as Creeper. One afternoon Creeper finds an anime DVD case with an ero game about little sisters inside and, being dumber than a potted plant, he can't figure out which of his family members it belongs to and there are only three of them besides him. After dropping some really obvious hints and laying a really obvious trap he's able to figure out that it belongs to his sister. The anime, naturally, never explains how a middle school kid managed to buy pornographic games. Creeper gets recruited to help his sister reconcile her hidden hobby with her personal life through a series of idiotic tasks. There's supposedly humour in this, but good luck finding a funny joke. Most of the jokes are based around either Creeper's sister complex or Kirino's hobby. Oreimo, just because you draw attention to the fact that your premise is gross and tell people to laugh, that does not diminish the repulsiveness. There's a smattering of other humour types, including an incredibly homophobic scene towards the end, but none of it is funny at all. On the plus side, the physical humour in this is quite cathartic since all the characters are annoying and horrible. It isn't funny, but it's cathartic. The finale in this is horrendous. The contrived final conflict comes out of and goes absolutely nowhere. Making it one of the most pointless finales in the history of anime. Then you have the incestuous undertones which serve to make the whole thing thoroughly unpleasant. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this are incredibly flat tropes. About the only thing that makes Creeper unique as a harem protagonist is his sister complex, which is not a positive change. For Kirino they just took the tsundere archetype, except that she's into her brother. Again, not a positive alteration. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is nothing special. It's kind of a typical moe style. What makes it worse than it could have been is the fan-service. Prepare for panty and bra shots of a fourteen year old. Then count yourself as fortunate that your name isn't on some type of registry. The backgrounds are pretty plain. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting in this sounds pretty bad. A lot of the emotion is portrayed by yelling instead of... what's the word? Oh yes, emoting. It's sad since the actors in this can act, when they have roles that actually require them to. I feel kind of sorry for Taketatsu Ayana. Just about every time her name gets mentioned in my reviews it's because she was in a role that demanded a terrible performance. There's this, Baka to Test, Highschool of the Dead, and Ichiban Ushiro no Daimaou. In contrast the only review I've done where she gave a truly good performance in the anime was K-on. The music is the best part of the anime. It's not good, but it's okay. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 5/10. Kirino's reaction to cute girls and her dynamics with both Kuroneko and Ayase come off as pretty homo-erotic. You know, this anime would have been greatly improved if they'd removed creeper completely and focused on that. It would still be stupid, but at least it wouldn't be gross.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is not as bad as I thought it was going to be. The incestuous under-tones are much more downplayed and far less prominent than I thought they would be. It's still a stupid, stupid anime with not a moment of laughter to be found and obnoxious tropes of characters. I do not suggest watching it or even thinking about its existence. My final rating is a 2/10.\\n\\n\r\nNext week, I'll be looking at Zettai Karen Children: The Unlimited- Hyoubu Kyousuke, unless something unexpected comes up.",

I was worried there would be massive amounts of incest, as anime tends to get into if there ever is a brother/sister scenario, but instead I was pleasantly surprised. It isn't about that, it's about the sweet relationship between a brother and a sister noticing each other for the first time in their lives. Overall, I loved the main character, he was relatable and hilarious, sweet and endearing, and overall a guy I would love tohang out with. However, his sister did annoy me, but at times I did enjoy her presence. The art was well done, simple and clean cut, the music was possibly the only lacking part of the show. If the music was more original I would have given it a 10. Overall, I love this show and when I finished the last episode I thought, \"Why did I like this? It wasn't though provoking or deep...\" I liked it because it was silly, carefree, and just so enjoyable to watch. I highly recomend this show! :) \\n\\n\r\nSorry for the poor grammar....and spelling... :)",

The title is Ore no Im\u014dto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai! or MY LITTLE SISTER CAN'T BE THIS CUTE! Lengthy title if you ask me, so I just call it OreImo or My Sister.\r\nI found this anime while browsing at a blog. It's a relatively good anime, something everyone can relate to. Even if you don't have a sister or the opposite. An incest anime without the sex and the love is replaced by abrother-sister love.\\n\\n\r\nIt's centered around the distant relationship of the \"Super Average\" 17-year-old Kyosuke Kousaka and his 14-year-old beautiful, Otaku, perverted and  \"tsundere\" sister, Kirino Kousaka, and how they try to know each other despite not communicating for many years even though they're at the same place. The only communication they go through is \"Tadaima!\" or \"I'm home!\" in English.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER ALERT!\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts with the male protagonist waking up. Well, got woke up by his sister. He grabs her and it turns out that it was a dream.\\n\\n\r\nLater on, he and she would bump, and Kyosuke finds a magical girl anime and does not know who owns it. Much to his surprise, the content was not the show but an eroge or erotic game. Dinner had passed by and Kyosuke learns that it's Kirino's stuff. Then, Kirino brings him to her room and finally leaks out the huge stash of little sister eroge she had been keeping from them until now. She is an avid fan of those themes and is an Otaku. \\n\\n\r\nThe story progresses as Kyosuke and Kirino build up their relationship with some struggles and new friends along the way. Examples are Kirino becoming a novelist and continues her modeling. While Kyosuke, becomes Kirino's slave-like brother and develops brotherly feelings for her.\\n\\n\r\nEven though it's a harem anime, there's not much ECCHI scenes to expect. If they were to do that, the show would be canceled and it will be branded as a lolicon/siscon hentai. The anime progresses much like an eroge, as Kyosuke always defends and helps his sister, even if he has to get punished, become a laughing stock, addressed as Sexual Harassment Senpai/Onii-Chan, anything! All of it just to fulfill her needs.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode has a different approach and different moments to look forward too. Some scenes make you cry, make you laugh and lastly, get you turned on. Hehehe... DON'T JUDGE ME! Why would you want your little sister playing an adult game  BESIDE YOU?! That's insane, but cool. >:D\\n\\n\r\nThe art was great, as it captured my heart instantly and made me explode with their cuteness. CUTENESS OVERLOADDDDDDDD!!!!!!! Just looking at the characters, you can already say that this one has this personality and this one with this personality. That's supposed to be a negative thing, but in this type of anime, it can be applied.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was limited to OST's and the Irony by ClariS. But it's enough for a 15 episode anime. I really enjoyed the anime a lot, and yes. I like Ecchi, Harem and sisters. BUT I'M NOT PERVERTED. It can be continued, as it lacks depth.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really like it. I like the pairing, the story, the scenes... Everything.",

            "content": "Before I begin, and before you watch this series, let me just say a bit of a brother-sister complex seems to form between the protagonists. It fades away near the end but I was squirming in my seat during a few scenes... it was strange to say the least. That said the relationship transforms beautifully into one any good older brother would be envious of. I mean imagine if your sister told you her problems! And you were able to help her with all of them! Minus the whole Otaku thing of course.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nWonderful plot, really something I wish I could see more of. Oftentimes animes will have a sibling bond flourishing during an anime after hitting a rather steep pit hole. Consider this a magnification of that relationship. Looking at it that way it seems much more satisfying than a weird (not to mention illegal) love story. The plot starts out as episodic and seems a bit scattered for the first half. The second half is more of a straight shot building itself on top of one another and utilizing the first half as foundation.\\n\r\nThe only real problem I can see about the plot is the protagonists back stories are not all that clear. The story manages to get around that, however, by starting from scratch with their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nFantastic. I love the symmetry and high schoolers looking like high schoolers! The faces are a thing of wonder as well, defying the industry completely, the females all have differentiating faces. It's not just one girl with multiple clones who dye their hair. The scenes are well done as well and the colors are vivid. Overall I find no flaws in the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nThe subbed voices are crisp and clear, they fit the characters very nicely in the subbed version. There was gonna be a dub but it was abandoned after someone leaked episode 2. The opening and ending themes are alright, not my style but they fit the series well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nSame failing as the story, the main characters don't have much of a back story to go off of and no flash backs are provided like maybe of a time when they were close. The story just starts from scratch which, while admirable, leaves the characters feeling a bit empty. However, the development of the cast is relatively good and easy to follow. I say 8 because it's hard to make a cast likable without providing any kind of back story but this series pulls it off quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nWhile very enjoyable, the afore mentioned complex just makes me way too uncomfortable to enjoy parts of it. Of course this is my personal opinion, I'm sure some people aren't quite as sensitive as I am on this topic so will enjoy it regardless. Then again if this was objective it would be called a synopsis.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, I think if you can manage to get past the weird relationship you'll come to really like the series. And like i said it sorts itself out in the end. \\n\r\nAlso avoid the OVAs if possible, the alternate ending sucks. That's what happens when you make an OVA of the ending before the actual ending happens.",

            "content": "My little sister couldn't possibly be this cute!  Well, Kyosuke let's see if she really was.\r\nStory:\r\nIt was good enough to keep me interested in what was going on, so kudos for that.  They developed the main characters relationships as the story passed along as well.  The pacing was good, and honestly, I can't wait to see how the second season continues it.  Now there are a few flaws here and there, but it's biggest flaw was that it was kind of predictable, I knew what was going to happen just by watching the first 5 or 6 minutes of almost everyepisode. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt was great, I had absolutely no issues with it, other than maybe that the shapes of their heads were a tad bit strange.  The colors were good and the scenery was great too.  8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAwesome, no complaints whatsoever.  OP/ED were catchy as well, which is something I always enjoy, gives me something to bob my head to when I start a new episode and finish one. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nNow, the characters are one of my issues with this show.  I don't have a problem with tsundere characters, but there's a fine line between tsundere and douchebag. That being said, Kirino was a douchebag throughout most of the series. Kyosuke putting up with it makes sense for his character, the caring older brother.  Soari and Kuroneko could have been fleshed out a little bit more, I liked them a lot.  The characters were, for the most part, enjoyable, and seeing their relationships develop created a bunch of great moments, 7/10 in this department.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe anime was very enjoyable.  It's funny when it calls for it, and touching when it needs to be.  It will keep you entertained, that's for sure. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall, it's a good show, I'd recommend giving it a watch.  The story is easy to follow, the art is very easy on the eyes, and the music great too.  The characters could be better, but you will still want to see their relationships develop as the story goes on.  So, overall I give this anime a 8/10.",

            "content": "To be honest I'm writing this review because, among the several reviews I read, I really didn't find any truly balanced reviews. Either people have a sort of blind love for the show or have a lengthy scathing rant based mostly on Kirino. Not that she doesn't deserve it, but still, I'd like to see a bit more balance from the reviews so I will try one.\r\nThe story is pretty easy to pick up. On the surface it is about a secret otaku whose brother goes out of his way to cater to her needs even though he really can't stand her. It also dealswith how an otaku deals with things like friendship among normal people and otakus. Yes it is pretty predictable, but there isn't anything really wrong with that, especially not for this type of show. The story itself is rather shallow, as it is mostly about the characters and the dialogue. It isn't exactly about incest, but that is something that is discussed and even flirted with at times in the show. I understand that the original ending to the show was not really straight from the manga, but without having read that, I felt like the \"good ending\" fit pretty well unless they have already decided to continue the show. I'll not say much more for fear of spoilers. I give the story an unspectacular 6.5.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty well done. The characters are all proportional unlike many series these days, and in my opinion they are all pleasing to the eye. Kyousuke is rather bland himself, and his childhood friend Manami is even more so. I think this is intended, but it feels rather odd with all of the colorful imoutos that are shown throughout the series. I noticed that they really wanted Kirino's nails to stand out. She frequently had different colored fingernails, and they were in bright colors that were easy to spot. The opening and ending animations were also pretty well done but not spectacular in my opinion. I give the art a good 8.5.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was decent. The voice actors seemed to do a good job with the characters. I have no real complaints there. The cutesy anime music drove into my nerves at times, but that's to be expected with this kind of show, and I don't really feel like it was overdone or anything. The music for the opening and endings was also well done but unspectacular. Overall I score sound as a solid 7.\\n\\n\r\nOk the characters is the part where I really have some trouble with this series. Kirino is as most people have said, mostly a bitch. Actually, no, she is a total bitch. She really steps all over Kyousuke, but then continually asks for his help with ever matter. Not to mention that aside from her personality, she is pretty much perfect. An honor roll middle schooler who is a model, a top athlete, a successful author, and soon to be anime creator. But she is completely horrible to the one person who supports her wholeheartedly. Even if she is shy and stubborn about showing her feelings, until the very end she never changes her \"Kyousuke is a dormat\" policy\\n\\n\r\n Kyousuke himself is as I said earlier, pretty bland. This seems intentional, but still feels off. Ever other main character in the story has a lot going for them. Even Manami, who seems forcibly bland herself, is a cute girl and an excellent cook. But Kyousuke is your generic \"normal guy in a harem\" so he has to be overly....normal. He is obviously very kind and means well with everyone around him, but that just makes it worse to watch him continually apologize to Kirino for going out of his way to be there for her no matter how bad she treats him. The relationship between them is odd and tense too often because of this. Yes the show flirts with the incest theme, and it even implies that there is some attraction from Kirino and possibly Kyousuke as well. But overall, it mostly portrays Kyousuke as the dutiful brother who really makes the extra effort to help out his little sister.\\n\\n\r\nKuroneko and Saori are by far and away the best characters in the show. They are given stereotypical otaku girl looks, and do not try to hide their hobbies like Kirino does. Saori ends up playing the older sister type. She's there for counseling mostly, as well as some comic relief. She and Kyousuke end up marshaling the fights between Kuroneko and Kirino. Kuroneko is a more interesting character. She is stubborn like Kirino, and can be rude, but she has a softer side. She very rarely shows this side toward Kirino, but it's there for people to see. If you like her character, you should check out the OVA's or the \"true ending\" of the show. She is featured in it and she manages to do something that no other character in the show ever does: Develop.\\n\\n\r\nAyase is Kirino's best friend. She goes pretty psycho when she fiinds out about Kirino's hobby, but after having everything fixed up by Kyousuke, she tries to understand her friend's obsession. Again, this is another time where Kirino  shows her colors. She never tries to change anything about how she approaches the situation, and it's fixed by Kyousuke in the end anyway. After that series of events Ayase pretty much fades into the shadows though.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters are mostly stereotypical and/or extras. While I have no real problem with most of the characters, putting Kirino alongside so many good and decent people just doesn't feel right sometimes. I know the series wouldn't work without that, but I feel like she's over the top as far as her rudeness goes, particularly toward her brother, who has done nothing but selflessly throw himself on the tracks for her sake time after time. I'm giving the characters a 6.5. Kuroneko's awesomeness, and the likeable Saori and Kyousuke don't make up for Kirino in this case.\\n\\n\r\nI am rating the enjoyment of the series an 8 because despite the issues I've laid out above, it is funny at times and generally pretty fun to watch. I am frustrated with Kirino's character, but mainly because she really is needed to tie everything together. I like Kuroneko and Saori, but without Kirino, it just wouldn't be as enjoyable to watch. I'm sure I will watch more if another season comes out, but I'm not sure I'll really remember this show in a few months time. If Kyousuke has to end up with one of the girls eventually, I hope it isn't his sister. Pretty much any of the other characters would be better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'm going to give this a 7.5 or an 8, mostly because it is pretty enjoyable. Whatever issues there are with the plot and the characters, the show itself is pretty fun.",

            "content": "Much better than I expected.\r\nWith lots of bright colors and a very light atmosphere, the art and animation is fantastic, clean, and simply very nice to look at, and the character designs stay true to the light novel illustrations and the manga.\r\nThe script is written fairly well, and supported by good voice acting, the dialogue flows very well, which is quite rare for an anime like this which usually have really awkward dialogues and situations. The atmosphere is lighter than the manga.  Most scenes are less intense and dramatic, with more comedic relief in the anime. But the script still balances the more seriouspart of the story with the lighthearted part nicely.\\n\\n\r\nStory wise, it's very good actually. Most people(at least the ones that I know) expect incest to come out of this, but so far, there's none. Though I won't be discussing the story in details, basically the story is more about a brother trying to help his sister with her hobby, which carries a stigma in the society they live in.  And how he helps her juggle between this and her perfect life.\\n\\n\r\nThough of course it's still at episode 5 when I wrote this review, and the anime has already caught up with the manga, and I don't read the light novels, so I can't say for sure how the story will go. However, even though the story might go through the incest route, it will only deepen the story, as it will give a moral conundrum to the story, which is always nice.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, if you don't like too much fanservice like me, you'd be glad to know that the amount of fanservice is a little bit less than the average anime. Which is much less than what I had expected.(Though I'd bet my ass there's going to be a mizugi special episode.)",

With other series like \"nogizaka haruka no himitsu\" and to a lesser extent shows like Genshiken, this topic has been covered before. However Ore No Imouto took an interesting and refreshing twist with this tried and true story. Without revealing too much the plot revolves around the almost non existent relationship between two siblings, Kirino and Kyousuke Kousaka. They would then be brought together by a series ofevents that reveal that Kirino has an excessive interest in anime and eroge, specifically those that deal with little sisters. The events that follow serve as both an homage and accurate parody of the world of anime and games. I greatly enjoyed this series, and will most likely rewatch it multiple times. The only fault I had with the series is that it ends.",

            "content": "Bias and first impression:\r\n\tI was a little surprised at the summary, and was not expecting much to tell the truth. I got the impression that this was going to be some strange sort of incest story.\r\n\tHowever, the first episode made me fall in love with this show, if only for a short while, for the great comedic value, and the unique qualities of the plot. It was not just another X\u2019s secret, it had no romantic tendencies, or poor ecchi\u2026Well there was fanservice in the way of shaking ass. In the end I came under the impression that this would be my favorite show duringits season.\\n\\n\r\nExpectation: Excellent 9\\n\r\nActual: 8/10... an 8.5?\\n\\n\r\nEpisode scores: 10,-,-,-,10,10,7,8,7,9,8,7\\n\\n\r\nAnalysis:\\n\r\n\tStory\\n\r\nThere is not much of a real plot. Essentially it revolves around Kirino\u2019s \u2018life counseling\u2019 and the outrageous lengths that her brother goes to help her. Yes, if this was a real sibling pair he would be unnaturally kind, sickening almost (although the same can\u2019t be said for Kirino). Yet it is this sickening sibling bond that makes his actions so spectacular, sometimes funny, that you can\u2019t help but love it.\\n\r\n\tThe story is episodic in nature, but the main point is to deliver as much laughs as possible. While a bunch of jokes are Kyousuke giving tsukkumi at his sister\u2019s ridiculous desires, or the nature of her otaku friends. The other bit comes from the situation irony he places himself into to save his sister.\\n\\n\r\n\tCharacters\\n\r\nKyousuke would be the ideal big brother, unless you would rather him put more value on himself than his sister. His interactions with the friends are great, and each one has something new to bring. Kuroneko is the only person willing to butt heads with Kirino, and her matter of fact tone is enjoyable. Saori is one of those mysterious people who mediates the gatherings, and is able to control the situation without self-sacrifice like Kyousuke. \\n\r\nHis childhood friend was a big surprise, because although convinced I did not like her at first being the typical airhead type, there is an awesome episode that completely turned my opinion around. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\n\tAs the show went on I was released from the spell that held me as a fan at the start. For once I was disappointed that a main issue was not dragged out too long, because as the later episodes came there were a few episodes that felt somewhat random. However I cannot say many bad things because honestly I loved it. \\n",

            "content": "[The \"FULL\" review... MAL decided to rip it in the half for some unknown reason. My apologies]\r\nDo you know where Hentai comes from? Well, to begin with, Japan have very strict rules regarding porn and video sharing is under rigid rules as well. So people had to find another way to make porn, specially the taboo ones. That said, someone had the ideia to turn it into a animation. \"Wow! it's not ilegal now, I wanna see it!\". Get my point? The same goes for these Siscon kind of series. It's harmless but it's different, interesting, uncommon, and you want to see it.\r\n-My, my, bob-kunyou're reviewing another fanservice harem, aren't you?\\n\r\n-It's not like it can be helped [...] No, wait. This is NOT a harem!\\n\\n\r\nSuggesting title, a theme that resembles it, moe characters, loli-like maho shoujo?, tagged \"seinen\"... This gotta be a harem!! Well... yeah, it's not. Were you wondering if it is like KissXSis? Or you ended up here after a easygoing ecchi/fanservice?\\n\r\nIf it was the first one, you're wrong. Try another one. If it was the second, congratz this is the right one for you!\\n\\n\r\nGoing straight to the point, this is a whole new interpretation of the seinen stories! HA. Who am I kidding, besides what they want you to think, this anime have nothing \"new\". There're some inovations but it ends up being the same.\\n\r\nThe story goes around the bitter sweet day-by-day of Kirino and Kyousuke Kousaka (YES. blood-related). Kirino ends up having a \"different\" hobbie. She loves anime, doujinshi and... erogues of 'loli little sisters'.\\n\r\nRecently there've been a lot of animes of this kind (not loli little sisters) but instead, series that talk about themselves, was created even a category for it: \"otaku culture\" what is better to sell a product if not making the user indentify himself with it?\\n\r\nBeing it a recurrent theme, OreImo's staff tried to diversify a little and twisted the main concept and layout of it. For this anime, as you can see, the otaku here is Kirino, a girl, not a NEET, popular, fashionable... I admit, it is interesting, that's why I watched it and now is reviewing.\\n\r\nIt's reasonable to think a new approach to the theme, and this new kind of scenario would have some problems. The plot itself seemed broken sometimes and had lots of flaws in the background story. There's no development of it! They didn't care to explain for you some events prior to the 1st episode, for example, why Kirino and Kyousuke relationship was \"frozen\" like that. Or what about Saori? What is she? A damn billionaire?\\n\r\nNot even in a flashback. Seriously? This wasn't the kind of storyline I was expecting from Aniplex (cmon, they did AnoHana).\\n\r\nOnly because it's a comedy anime it doesn't mean you're free from developing this part.\\n\\n\r\nWhile reviewing the story, it's interesting to point out, that OreImo succeded at making the anime looks like a visual novel. You have the 1st season with 12 episodes that ends in one way, and another 4 eps special with a different ending.\\n\r\nFor those in doubt, you can better enjoy it if you watch all together:\\n\r\nMain series: 1 to 12.a\"good ending\"\\n\r\nSpecials: 12.b to 15\"true route\" [2nd season will pick up from here]\\n\r\nComentary: 1 to 16 [you don't have to watch this one. Just chibi extras.]\\n\\n\r\nThe production staff had very nice and interesting ideias for the OP/ED and soundtrack. There's a different opening and ending song for every each one of the episodes and the animation of it is also slight different. This is something to give credit for, they reinvented the OP/ED in a way it was interesting to watch, not like other animes when you just skip it because it's repetitive and gets boring after a while.\\n\r\nThe OP song was done by ClariS, (you probably heard about it already), they're two middle-schoolers girls who happened to debut as singers, another promissing new talent that fits with the concept of \"inovation\" the anime brought.\\n\\n\r\nAnother letdown of OreImo was definitely the characters. Not because they aren't nice, but because there is no development of it at all. It was completly left aside. MAYBE it will get better in the 2nd season but for this 1st, it was just painful to watch. A lot of strong supportive characters weren't developed as they could be. For some reason (maybe the fanservice) the staff sticked with KirinoXKyousuke and forgot about the others. Ayase for example, gets a lot of screen time but her development is left off to the side making her look like a stupid side-kick that have nothing to add.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the female lead, Kirino, is a horrible person. No matter how you look at  it. She's 99% tsun, 1% dere. I thought they would change it during the story but it didn't. She stayed with the same despicable personality the whole story in a way that makes you anger about it. I felt like I was watching SchoolDays again.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone was so hyper about this anime that I decided to give it a try.\\n\r\nThis was a great anime about \"otaku culture\" but pretty much sucked at other things. They tryied to catch seinen viewers by using the \"Siscon\" stuff but in the end it turns out to be an average story that could be better developed. \\n\r\nIt's not the best anime of its season. However, if you have free time and think of yourself as a otaku or a \"erogamer\" (whatever), you'll have a nice time with the tons of references  and \"visual\" jokes they present in this anime.\\n\r\nQuoting my friend: \"Watch it for the experience\"\\n\r\nIf you want a better enjoyment of the series, please read the manga.\\n\r\nStory: 7 | Art: 8 | Sound: 8 | Character: 7 | Enjoyment: 8 | Overall: 7\\n\\n\r\nIf you read until here BEFORE voting down (or up), thanks!!\\n\r\nPleeease talk with me! I don't bite! I'm a needy person, I need comments to improve my reviews! These heartless buttons are useless. There's nothing like interacting with humans :3",

Kirino treats him like crap and he just keeps going back for more.\r\nThe story and some of the characters reactions to finding out that Kirino was an otaku was just ridiculous. Getting all worked up and actinglike it's the worst hobby you could have in the world, was just really blowing it out of proportion and made it unbearable unrealistic for me.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I wouldn't suggest this anime to anyone. It's quite possibly the most annoying/worst anime I have ever watched. It's so bad that I actually wrote my first review on this site just to blow off some steam about how much I hated this anime.",

Love her obsession with imouto and the huge collection she keeps hidden in her closet which reminds me very much of the collection in my closet, impressively disturbing.  A popular heroine with a hobby that is not quite accepted by her peers, reminds me of Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu.  The brother, Kyosuke, is a great contrast from Kirino.  Reminds me a lot of Kyon except way more willing to cooperate with the somewhat unreasonable heroine, even going so far as to make himself out to bea perverted siscon to cover for his sister in front of family and friends.  The other characters were all entertaining to watch; an old school, glasses wearing otaku that is way too friendly, a dark, gothic lolita girl who would be obsessed with series like Rozen Maiden and Loveless (teen complex....oh high school anime fans I don't miss you), the normal friend that is borderline yandere, a rabid yaoi fangirl obsessed with homosexual men, they are all fun to watch.  The animation is great and gives a lot of attention to Kirino's cute butt....*cough*I love the way they handled the last episode with the whole visual novel choice dialogue.  It applied the main otaku focus of eroge and used it to give us multiple endings.  L.O.V.E. it!~  Kirino no oshiri ha tottemo kawaii deshyo~!  Sisterly Kirino is also cute.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\nNormal girl is normal....to the point I can not remember her name and just call her normal girl.  Kirino constantly beats on her brother in the style of \"violent retribution for minor infringement\"with little reason a lot of the time just without such cartoony violence like is standard for that.  Would have liked more backstory for the siblings and why they were so distant from each other for so long.\\n\\n\r\nThe Ugly:\\n\r\nNothing in particular.  I can not really think of anything I hate about this series.\\n\\n\r\nA solid series that is emotional in a lot of ways and never too much of a downer.  I would recommend it to almost anyone.  Kirino has a cute butt.\\n\\n\r\n*My reviews are read like lists so I just write down whatever comes to mind so sorry if it seems a bit scatterbrained.

I love the comedic antics both the brother and the sister and people around them!\r\nThe brother go through much humiliation dashing off to Kirino's rescue despite she doesn't show much of the appreciation that her brother (Kyousuke) deserved.\r\nI highly recommend this anime to anybody who is looking for some goof laugh~ >_<",

Regardless, its portrayal of finding a group of like-minded individuals is almost heartwarming. Almost. Kirino, the little sister, is a really bizarre creation, however. She\u2019s almost too unique and strange to dismiss, and yet at every moment we are aware of her as a product of a calculated effort to be two things at once (both a proud enthusiast of the fetish that the show\u2019s about, and also an object to be fetishized over by the audience). Kirino then remains more of a provocation, anidea, than a fully fleshed-out character.  Also: I hate everything that this represents in modern anime culture.\\n\\n\r\ncopied/pasted from my blog: www.thenextthingblog.wordpress.com",

As I watched the first episode, I was wrong. \r\nThe story is about Kyosuke, ordinary high school student, his almost perfect sister Kirino. Due to a timely \"bump with each other\", Kyosuke discovers his sisters unimaginable other life, an otaku. Thus the beginning of the story of a brother protecting his sister and her hobbies.\r\nThough maybe typical, no excitement at all story, it is actually what made it(for me) special. No need for exaggerated characters at all, no need for climatic plot or anything that makes on the edgeof their seats. Just simple life problems that we all could relate. \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is the opening song. Way too addictive.\\n\\n\r\nI suggest try watching it at first.

The story was great, the art was great, sound was good, good characters (a tsundere for a main protagonist XD) i enjoyed it and overall, to me, it deserves a score of 9. Well, theres a whole lot of people saying that this anime is incest, to me, it's not. Or rather, i wouldn't accept it to be =3=~~~~  Haha! well, one reason why it isn't incest to me is that i see (picture) a loving brother who dotes his sister, there isn't anything wrong with that is there? I wouldn't suggest it to people whoare sensitive to incest or brother-sisterly love (or maybe even forbidden love, just sayin') but i would suggest it to those who are MAYBE in-the-closet kinds of otakus, not wanting your parents and friends to find out, yada yada yada~ and also to those..... who just need a good watch. This is your find, it's a great anime and you can sue me if you don't like it :3 But! ironically, i have two brothers. If you know what i mean ;) Well, Overall, Great anime, loved it, will support it and looking forward to season 2 :D  \\n",

            "content": "Prologue:\r\nMy Little sister can\u2019t be this cute originated from a series of light novels Written by Tsukasa Fushimi and Illustrated by Hiro Kanzaki. It was widely popular In japan with It\u2019s focus on Otaku culture & what not. It was then later adapted Into a manga & more recently an Anime which Is produced AIC.\r\nWith a title such as \u201cMy little sister\u201d You\u2019d assume an Incesty fanservice filled Moe show with nothing but panty shots & SUPER KAWAII SUGOI DESU ~ but suprisingly enough you\u2019d be wrong. For the most part anyway\u2026\r\nStory:\r\nAs this site already holds synopsises, I won't explain the premise. Simply scroll up.\r\nAtfirst It seems like a run of the mill Echii setup by including Eroge and Otaku pandering. But oddly enough \u201cOre Imoto\u201d manages to keep it\u2019s story engaging with various scenarios that many Otaku\u2019s would go through as well as general teenage issues, having to deal with school and friends. Especially the first few episodes which were exceptionally well at creating these situations. Later there are a few more far fetched ideas thrown in such as Kirino getting her own Anime series which was underplayed and completely unrealistic. Theres another section when they completely unresolved an issue that was initially brought up In the first place. Another negative note Is while the shows not *EXTREMLY* Incest heavy, toneing It down from the original source material theres still certain moments In this Anime that make you go \u201cNO, stop making these little jokes & hints at Incest. It\u2019s getting out of hand.\u201d Honestly some parts can make you *cringe* at how the Incest undertones are handled, It didn\u2019t ruin the show but It did dampen the experience for me personally.\\n\\n\r\nDespite this It\u2019s emulation on Otaku lifestyle Is accurate for the most part and easy for most Otaku\u2019s to get involved In.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAs far as characters go Kyosuke can come off as a little bit of a smart ass. But he\u2019s very likable, he\u2019s less obnoxious and more sarcastic If anything. He doesn\u2019t really care If his comments come off as brash or rude but just kinda says them without being a Inconsiderate Jerk. His personalities best compared to Kyon from Haruhi Suzimiya as while he constantly around harebrained nonsense he still manages to react to the situation In a mature and helpful manner. He can seem Generic and void of a personality at times, but he still comes of as more *Independent* than boring.\\n\\n\r\nKirino on the other hand burdens the fatal flaw of alot of leads of this archetype. Which Is the overplayed Tsundere act. At first It seemed her character was while pompous, arrogant and a pain was still grateful for what her brother does for her. Sadly while the episodes progress her character doesn\u2019t as she keeps herself One dimensional for most of the series showing only a little sign of good character near the end. Granted she can be funny and show some sincerity at times but there simply too few & far inbetween. It seems rather than thanking Kyosuke for helping her she punishes him, taking advantage of the characters forgiving & mature nature. Kirino doesn\u2019t ruin the entire Anime, but If you have issues watching characters like Haruhi then proceed with caution.\\n\\n\r\nDespite Kirino\u2019s over acting being more \u201cTsun\u201d than \u201cdere\u201d, the supporting cast manages to help out alot. There vibrant, likable, and funny. Unfortunately most of the screen time Is consumed by Haruhi-2.0 when the side characters really should have gotten more of it as they were far more enjoyable. Making for some Comedic scenarios had me laughing out loud.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Music:\\n\r\nAnimation wise this show Is extremely colorful. AIC handle the Art direction oh so well ~ Characters are vibrant and well detailed with a wonderfully colorful art style without being overly Moe. Backgrounds, character expressions, are all drawn In a fashionable way. AIC really made no flaws In the animation department. The music Is another well done aspect. The Opening theme Irony Is extremely catchy, I still can\u2019t get that song out of my head. Ending themes are changed episodically with a new track fitting the theme of the episode. Not many memorable one\u2019s but still sounded pretty good & gave a nice change in variety. Background music can also be catchy If not a little generic but thats not to say It\u2019s a bad thing It fits the Otaku\u2019est atmosphere of the show. Theres also a few J-pop insert songs like the \u201cMeruru theme song\u201d which are more of a personal guilty leasure to listen too. Typical and childish as It may be.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEpilogue:\\n\r\nIn the end My little sister has It\u2019s ups & downs. While Its view on Otaku Is well done the central character It focuses on Is flawed In various ways. It could have handled certain situations much better as I felt some issues touched upon were done sub-parley. And while It\u2019s focus Is on Otaku Its for a more Eroge/Moe type looking at Adult oriented Visual novels, Doujinshi & Magical girl anime and less on Different types of genres. Granted you could say It was made In Japan so It would have more of a look on most Japanese Otaku but It can still throw off some people watching It. Aside the flaws it still manages to be an entertaining and enjoyable series with a colorful cast of characters for the most part, along with a kind story about an Brother helping out his younger sister and her struggles with everyday teen life and secret Otaku lifestyle.\\n\\n\r\nThis Is Otakuman saying Goodbye & Sionara ~\\n\\n",

Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai (Ore no Imouto for short) is an anime that...I really should not like, but I do...A Lot.

It is one of my biggest \"guilty pleasures\".\r\nRatings List:\r\nStory 7/10:\r\nThe amount of good plot that Ore no Imouto actually has come as a suprise. While other in the slice of life genre tend to just have a group of friends thathang out and do..well...stuff, Ore no Imoto works much more like a romance than an average slice of life. The main characters, Kirino and Kyosuke, build their relationship slowly over the course of the show.There is also a lot of comedy in the show that is hilarious. The powerful themes of fitting in and friendship that are shown over the course of the show really do hit home. The basic concept of the plot something that I have never seen before, and something that drew me in right off the bat (point for originality). Ore no imouto just has a certain way of drawing you into it's world and making you forget that its even and anime. I found that there were many times during the show when I could barely watch the screen because I was laughing to hard or because I was so embarrassed about a situation that the characters were in.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10:\\n\r\n Like in many romance/slice of life shows, its the characters and their interactions that you come to watch, and Ore no Imoto does not fail to deliver.The 2 main characters are almost polar opposites. The main character Kyosuke is a laid back guy that loves his ordinary life. The main heroine Kirino is a hyper and popular girl. She is a hardcore ( and I'm talking HARDCORE) anime fan, but is afraid to tell her friends about it in fear of being shunned by her family and friends. These 2 lead the show and because they are so opposite in personality. Their romance feels genuine and it's fun watching the two grow closer over the duration of the show. Also because of their opposites in personality the romance can become hilarious at times too. Along side the main characters are a group of side characters that all have their different roles to play in the show. They were all memorable and all seems at least somewhat fleshed out. Many of the characters (even a lot the side ones) felt a lot like real people, which really helps to draw you into the world.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: \\n\r\nThe art of Ore no Imouto was simply astounding. There is an amazing attention to detail in the background and in the character designs. The characters are always in a variety of outfits, and the art style is very colorful and cheery for the most part. That colorful and upbeat art style really fits the overall mood of the show. Personally, Ore no Imouto has some of the best art I have seen in a romance anime in a long time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment Level 8/10: \\n\r\nAt the end of the day I have to say that I enjoyed this show a lot. Ore no Imouto is definitely worth the watch for anyone that enjoys hilarious and romantic fun. Although I was cautious about the show and its play on incest; I soon even forgot that the main characters were ever brother and sister. They are complete opposites in almost every way possible, from hair color to personalty. It has a rather good plot that can at times be rather engrossing; which is a lot more than I can say for many others in its genre. Overall, Ore no Imouto was a mixed bag of fun times with amazing art and music, original ideas, and lifelike characters.",

            "content": "SubGroup: [ANE] (BluRay)\r\n\"Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai\" was an interesting and very entertaining Anime, although not an \"Entry-level\" show a must-watch for any anime fan. \r\nThe main character covers for his sister over and over leading to some extremely awkward and hilarious scenes (one in particular with their Anti-Otaku policeman father causing me to inhale a mouthful of cola and almost die).\r\nEven though he does so much for his sister, Kirino has a lot of trouble showing affection towards her brother and is almost all Tsun and no Dere, to the point I would refer to her as \"Tundra\" xD.\r\nThereare characters which are Tsundere to the point where Tsundere may no longer be an appropriate description.\\n\r\nI was particularly impressed with the OP videos which change every episode.\\n\r\nThe TV show aired 12 episodes but the Bluray includes an alternate 12th episode and an additional 3 episodes which focus more on Kuroneko These episodes follow the story as written in the light novels where the aired episode 12 was written for the Anime to end it at 12 episodes for the schedule. These episodes have a slightly more \"not-safe for airing\" dialogue one which again almost caused my death and introduce a number of new characters including Akagi's sister causing some amazing moments to this extension of such a great show. I feel the extension episodes may have been better that the aired ones but I should take into account they built up on the events of those previous ones.\\n\r\nApart from the show almost killing me....twice, It feels like they poured the last of their budget into the Bluray. The Bluray-only episodes' OP and ED were also a big step-up. I would like to see a sequel series but one following the bluray \"True\" story rather than the aired one.\\n\r\nThe Audio and story directing was very well done with very fluid emotion from start to finish leading to a climactic ending.\\n\\n\r\nNot to give anything away, the true ending was truly spectacular and beautiful. I really hope more people get to see it.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all though a very well executed Anime that is a barrel of laughs and well worth an afternoon for the casual-minded.\\n\\n\r\nI look forward to giving the sequel an even better review!\\n\r\n\"Meerumerumeru merumerumerume\"",

What got me into the anime was the gorgeous opening, then I thought it was gonna be bro x sis love or something like that (hence the title) in fact I kinda was waiting for it. Then when I continued to watch, I realized it isn't what it seems. Still, it was extreeemely good. \r\nComedy is what defines this best to me. \r\nBy the way, the only thing that disturbs me is that THIS NEEDS TO\r\nHAVE ASECOND SEASON. Trust me, there are some things that are not left clear in the story. Seems like they released this to see how much success it could have to decide whether or not to release a second season later. Guess they should act now. And oh theres a manga but I heard theres something important here that isnt in the anime.  \\n\r\nIts worth watching. I loved it, actually.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "What's more fun than an anime about things you like? And being on this website you are probably into anime, games and such. Am I right? Then you should totally watch Oreimo!\r\nMy expectations\r\nOne of the newest anime, and already one of my favorites is Ore no imouto ga konnani kawaii wake ga nai, wich means My little sister can't be this cute. For short the term Oreimo is often used to describe this anime. When I first read the title I thought that it would be a very ecchi and incesty anime. Oreimo is in fact ecchi sometimes, and there is a bit of sexualtension between the main characters, but not in an incesty kind of way. The relationship between brother and sister Kyosuke and Kirino is in my opinion a natural relationship between siblings.\\n\\n\r\nPlot\\n\r\nKyosuke never really got along with his younger sister Kirino. One day he accidentally discovers his sister is into anime and especially likes playing eroge (erotic video games). Kirino begs Kyosuke to keep her secret since their dad is against anime and thinks Otaku are dangerous and crazy. Also Kirino is a model and is ashamed of her hobby, so none of her friends at school know about her secret. Kyosuke agrees to keep his sister's secret, but that's just the the first episode of the series... Kirino starts to love the fact that she can now talk about eroge with her brother and forces him to play them. One thing leads to another and soon Kyosuke is soon dragged into Kirino's little otaku world, and forced to do all kinds of embarrassing stuff while trying to keep it all secret.\\n\\n\r\nReview\\n\r\nThe visual effects of this anime are very good seeing as it is a quite new series, released in 2010. I don't have any flaws I want to point out. The character designs are very up to date and cute too. The plot is kind of predictable and the anime is almost exactly what I imagined it to be. In my opinion that is not a bad thing though. The strongest point of this anime for me is that I could very easily relate to Kirino because she is an otaku. So if you'd like to see a very funny and recognizable anime with some slightly ecchi scenes, that is exactly what you'll get from Oreimo.",

            "content": "This is a series about Kyousuke, an average high school boy, who begins to mend a rocky relationship with his talented and popular younger sister Kirino, in an rather unusual way. He accidentally discovers that she is obsessed with ultra-cute anime and little sister themed erotic games. She fears rejection from her peers and parents if her passions are exposed, but regrets being unable to socialize with people who share her interests. Kyousuke becomes her guide to accepting her secret hobby and sharing it with similar people. The two of them may not get along well, but as they begin to work together, the distancebetween each other starts to fade. Both hilarity, and personal growth, ensues.\\n\\n\r\nOreImo, as it is commonly called, is a romantic comedy with some rather unconventional themes. Although this is a series made for TV broadcast, it does carry some mature subject matter, which could offend the viewer depending on their position on brother-sister relationships and erotic games. There is indisputable sexual tension between Kirino and her brother Kyousuke, although her personality could be described as \"tsundere\", or combative on the exterior, allowing for some creative comedy along the way. Outside of what may be considered controversial themes in this anime, there is an innocent story of a girl who once looked up to her brother, lost faith in him, and begrudgingly wished to help him gain a renewed passion for what he cares about. Kyousuke is a guy who unintentionally let his sister down, but is a considerate person who offers his acceptance of her, and to give her advice on subjects she fears to share with people. These two, along with the friends they make along the journey, might have some all-too familiar anime tropes (tsundere little sister, male lead finds himself surrounded by cute girls), but I can't say that I found anything dull in this anime's execution.\\n\\n\r\nThe series presents its overall mood and pacing right from the start. If the viewer enjoys the first few episodes, they'll find the remainder shouldn't disappoint. A viewer unsure of their position on the subject matter should have a fair idea rather quickly if the story's content will offend or bother them. If one finds the anime's premise and characters enjoyable, fear not, for the production quality does not disappoint. Character art is attractive, precise, unwavering, and versatile. Colors of both main characters, background/supporting characters, settings, outdoor scenes, and cities are strikingly vivid, crisp, and lack variance of detail. The voice acting employed was well performed and fitting for the characters, and I found it to be wonderfully enjoyable. Opening and ending themes are catchy tunes with lighthearted pace and sound; I found myself more often than not sitting through both each episode. Background music blended well with each scene's mood; the one I remember best is this nonchalant reggae tune that plays when the siblings are hanging out. In my opinion, the world of OreImo felt engaging and fun.\\n\\n\r\nThere's little I can consider of poor quality or execution in this anime series. It is worth noting that it not only has an alternate ending available to see (the \"specials\"), but also has a sequel. I for one was a large skeptic of this anime when I first read its premise, but I'm glad I decided to watch it. Although I honestly doubt that this anime's technical merits will sway those who dislike the story's overall premise, if you're share my personal tastes for tsundere's, otaku themes, and sibling themes, or if you're just curious, I seriously recommend giving this anime a chance.\\n",

The best part of her is the actual annoyance she create, I seldomly know any heroine which specificly 'exist to annoy you' like Kirino. Most writers would want their heroine to be lovable and attractive to the audiences, but the author of OreImo decided to do the opposite, and it worked pretty nicely, though you still would want her to be alittle nicer and at least thank her brother properly for literally saving her existence\\n\\n\r\nAs for Kyousuke, I find his character highly unrealistic, he might look like the best existence you can ever have for a brother, but that is where it is illogical. Kyousuke had stated countless times that he hates Kirino, right from the beginning to the end, but he will go to extreme measures for her(SPOILER ALERT, skip the rest of this paragraph if you don't want to read spoilers) threatening to beat up his own father(which in turn could end up in him being beaten up himself and thrown out of the house for a week). Throwing away all his pride to beg to the animator team for Kirino's masturbation novel that he didn't even enjoy himself(which his and Kuroneko's rude attitudes towards them could've backfire them in the first place, normally if you talk like that to someone you want to please, chances are they won't be pleased and might even cancel out the anime project for it). Shaming himself countless times(acting like a total pervert for Ayase to make up for her friendship with Kirino, buying eroge in front of a huge crowd, seen by his own best friend and some other townspeople who show outright disgust to him), etc and YET he is willing to continue being Kirino's slave when he fully have the right to kick Kirino for his own frustration.\\n\\n\r\nFor the other supporting/minor characters, many are too bland, illogical, or simply not appealing enough. Ayase, Kuroneko and Saori became close to Kyousuke for no particular reason(well there is a reason and it is: he needs a harem). Manami is the only girl who is reasonable enough to be romanticly involved with Kyousuke and yet the story would intentionally kill her charm by calling her mundane by itself, which would have raised her appeal if the story have just left those sentences out(well they have to tone her down so the harem could happen, otherwise she would officially be Kyousuke's legal wife and no other girl could be paired with him), and another character featured in the OVA, Akagi Sena, Kyousuke's friend's little sister, had showed severe obsession on yaoi, to the extent that it impaired her logic and moral to be stupid enough to present an idea on a yaoi game in a room full of straight guys, not noticing that it could as well get her kicked or expelled from the club, if not school.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion this series is decent if you want to watch something while turning your brain off, ignoring all the illogical points and enjoying the nonsense of a seemingly masochistic brother being beaten by his sadistic little sister, but well if you don't like anime that annoy you, whether or not you like tsunderes or not, you should stay away from this anime just to keep your nerves intact.",

            "content": "\"mmm, this tastes pretty good.\"\r\n-Kyosuke Kousaka, Oreimo\r\nSuch a deep, profound quote from an anime equally as powerful in meaning. As a slice of life romcom, I didn't expect much from Oreimo when I first heard about it. Boy oh boy, how wrong I was, and I think this quote is a perfect example of how this anime spoke to me.\r\nSome of the greatest shows of the past few centuries (giving examples such as Boku no Pico and it's almost-as-good counterpart Sword Art Online) have become almost universally recognized as anime classics. Why? Because while they may seem like humble stories at first, they are ultimatelyconveying a sapient message to viewers, merely using anime as a communication medium. Boku no Pico used the guise of a short love drama to relay a deeper message about the average intelligence quotient of today's 5-year-old-boys. Similarly, Sword Art Online was a message about how wearing black clothes magically gets you a personal harem for no apparent reason, using an adventure anime as a cover. It is the same way with the work of genius that is Oreimo.\\n\\n\r\nPLOT 10/10\\n\r\nThe plot of Oreimo is like none other you've see in anime. It ignores all cheesy cliches of the slice of life genre. For example, the main character is a male, except he is surrounded by a hoard of females. This technique is called a \"Harem,\" and it is very rarely used in anime because of it's difficulty to master. Well I can say for certain that this show masters the art of the Harem. It is little details such as these which separate Oreimo from the torrents of crap romcoms coming out today.\\n\\n\r\nBut as I mentioned earlier, Oreimo houses a deeper meaning. In reality, this show explores the meaning of forbidden love and how the social convention causes us to make decisions we may not want to do.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 10/10\\n\r\nIt's been said a unique cast of characters is all that is needed to make an anime great, and I have to say I disagreed with this statement... until I saw Oreimo. When you watch most slice of life shows, you often see a female lead who is so shallow you can predict her every line or one that doesn't change at all during the series. Oreimo, being the masterpiece that it is, ignores both of these cliches. Our heroine, Kirino, changes her personality arbitrarily, with no consistency whatsoever in her logic or actions. This makes her unpredictable, and thus, much more enjoyable to watch. Furthermore, she changes immensely over the course of the series. At first, she is cold to her brother, the main character, but as the show progresses, she starts to show a much warmer side. This kind of character development is very rare in the world of anime, and it's one of the reasons why this show is so great.\\n\\n\r\nVISUALS/SOUND 10/10\\n\r\nWhoever animated this series is a god. Visually, everything in this series is stunning. While everything about this show's artwork is superb, there are a few bits which I consider to be among the most well drawn-frames in all of anime, the main highlight being Kirino's left earlobe. This earlobe has become semi-famous in the anime community for is superior art quality, and easily is my favorite anime facial body part of all time.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL I give this anime a well-earned 10/10. It is an absolute work of art and must not be missed. You can watch it on crunchyroll for legal streaming, but if for some reason that doesn't work for you then you can stare at a piece of blank cardboard for a few hours to get the same effect.\\n\\n\r\nP.S., This review conforms to all review guidelines, so I'd like to see you try and take it down, Maffy.",

I am shocked. Why is everyone okay with this. Why does Kirito look like that. I'm so appalled. Solid 5. \r\nStarting from season 2, I can say that the episode structure was quite well done. The background effects and side characters were nondistracting yet pleasant to look at on my 16th rewatch. The music was soft yet pleasant to listen to as I paid attention to the ramblings of the characters discussing their sin.However, the horrible face of the protagonist took me for a surprise everytime I saw it. The protagonist, from the start of the episode, faced a major character change until the end of the show; this was well done except for the fact that the said character change was \"sexually loving your own sister\".",

            "content": "I've seen plenty of anime in my time, and out of all of them, Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai! has the privilege of being the single worst one I've ever witnessed. I last saw it many years ago and it's not even worth going back to revisit so I can make a more comprehensive review of why it's such a blemish on humanity. I can't even recall what drove me to watch it in the first place, but it was probably the fact that everyone talked about it back then (somehow, it still has a decently sized following). My internet historyis stained with frantic searches for a summary to refresh my memory of why this show is so historically godawful. \\n\\n\r\nOreimo was written by pathetic greasy mutant author Tsukasa Fushimi. Look him up. It's not just namecalling, he actually looks really gross. This whole series is more than likely his wish fulfillment for the fact that he never had a little sister to fuck when growing up, and his series is thus completely ridden with incestuous undertones and targets an audience of similar greasy mutant creeps who can only dream what life would be like if they had a younger sister to fornicate. Morals are being defied all over the place. \\n\\n\r\nThe story, in summary, shows us an older brother who finds out that his dumb bitch sister is actually a giant otaku pervert who collects eroge. Then some shit happens and they get married. Not only disgusting, but also completely uninteresting. There's an attempt to mix it up a little (a poor one, at that) by throwing in another otaku bitch as an alternate love interest for the older brother, who dresses up in gothic lolita and is useless. Apparently she's the better one, but whatever. Beyond the projection of sick fantasies there is nothing notable or likable about any of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe only good thing I can think of is the art and animation and even then it isn't of a degree that redeems the rest of this sick filthy show. The characters at least LOOK nice I guess. Maybe the artist was just in it for the money.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways Oreimo is a dumb and bad and filthy show. I'm angry just from typing this up. Stay far away from it. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Amongst the things i cannot comprehend, is incest, and quite frankly, when i saw the name of this anime on my plan to watch list, i was scared senseless. Rather oddly, It wasn't as bad as I would have thought concerning the sibling relationship. And i would go as far as saying, that it was actually an okay anime. The major flaws in here would still be the fact that it tries to be taken too seriously when the matter at hand is quite ridiculous. \r\nthe setting itself can't be considered original, its the same ''normal schoolboy'' setting we have all seen so many timesbefore and the only ''twist'' to it is the fact his sister is an eroge addict (how or where she procures herself these adults materials while she is only 14 or so is never explained). All along the anime she tries to live with her love of eroge while trying to not be viewed as an otaku by keeping it secret and I still have to admit that it is somewhat intriguing to see the view society has regarding otaku and at some times we could indeed see the social problems with being a fan of anime and feel the awkwardness of her passion, the main problem is the fact that the anime is either too serious when discussing the matter or too ridiculous when it is not the time for it. it then pleases no audience since it cannot effectively choose the timing for comedy or drama to aid the ''plot'' (which is somewhat nonexistent since the anime adopts a semi-episodic approach). In the end it was simply boring because it went for the most part with generic and ''seen before'' situation which killed the whole originality of it. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were sadly very clich\u00e9d, relying on some generic character personalities and bringing little to no modification to the original ''canvas'' of the character,  and that again did not help to the appreciation of the anime since it lacked originality. Plus the main characters being already quite bland, the side characters with little personality did only add bitterness to the already borderline acceptable mix. even if we do witness some kind of character development and evolution in the matter they all interact with each other, the evolution was either random or simply not important enough.In the end, the characters were still lacking, and it is sad to say because there was some potential in the character setting to make them quite good.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the plus side, the art actually surprised me a little, being somewhat better than other anime i have seen this year, it provided some acceptable character design and some alright (often animated) backgrounds. \\n\\n\r\nthe music, regrettably, did not follow in the footsteps of the visual art, being generic and quite repetitive, it did not help to make the anime enjoyable as it did not bring any remarkable support to the visuals. the voices however were quite good and interesting, very well casted but ,again, could sometimes have been more expressive.\\n\\n\r\nin the end, it was an acceptable anime, wasn't that good, yes, but wasn't horrible. even if it was at times boring, it stayed interesting in the most part of the anime. I would suggest this to any fan of this sort of anime. \\n\\n\r\nps: This is absolutely not a seinen, make no mistakes.",

            "content": "Ore mo Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai (going to shorten that into Oreimo) at first glance looks like anime about the a brother and sister trying to find common ground then form a relationship but in itself it is more complicated than that as it also focuses on the various friendships that the two characters have and trying to maintain them as well as the huge amount of Otaku that the female lead character uses.\r\nStory - 7\r\nThe story of this anime was interesting as it was a surprising change to me who thought it was going to be about the sister chasing afterher brother but this was not the case as it was completely different which I believe gave it an original style and upbeat personality look to it. There are multiple plot twists in the anime which give it a fresh start every time they occur which drew me in more to the story and characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nThe Art in Oreimo looks like the standard anime art in other anime which I do like as it is my favourite style but I didn't real much detail on the characters or their clothing which did disappoint me but doesn't ruin the series for you, but that aside I found that the background art was very well detailed and some of characters clothing was quite detailed an example of this being Saori's clothing and Accessories.    \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\r\nThe opening soundtrack that is used in the anime was very well chosen as it suited the anime as it reflected a slice of life sort of theme that makes you feel more at home with it. The rest of the soundtrack in the anime is a wonderful piece of work that has some addicting songs and has some OSTs that help enhance certain moods especially with the character themes. The voice actors did a wonderful job as they really fit into their character roles and play it very especially when looking at their work a viewing the roles they have done which is a huge variety of characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nThe characters in Oreimo are a wonderful piece of work that vary in look, personality and style that give of the appearance of a well done slice of life mood so the anime has no out of place characters. The main characters are very different from each other in terms of personality which makes them all the more interesting but I'm not going to go into to much detail as I don't want to spoil it; the supporting characters are also very well fleshed out with it having a completely different personality than the other which makes the anime all the more good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8\\n\r\nI did enjoy this anime as much as I could as I enjoyed the various character interactions as well as the OST but I did find that story was boring at times and would drag but after seeing it all the way through I can see how I enjoyed it from one side to the other with a plot that is slow but original and fun to watch in the end. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8 \\n\r\nIn overall I would say that this anime is a much watch for anyone who loves a great slice of life and drama anime that has an original story and characters as well as a awesome soundtrack.      \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai (a.k.a. Oreimo or My Little Sister Can\u2019t be This Cute) was probably the most hyped up anime of the season. When you consider that the little sister referred to in the title is a 14-year-old fashion model with a rabid obsession over anime and erotic games, it\u2019s not hard to see why it would get anime fans talking.\r\n|\r\nOk\r\nStory 10/10\r\nI have to say, this anime probably slapped alot of people in the face if they expected another run of the mill ecchi, moe, and or even incest anime. Well my face has a big red hand printon it.\\n\r\nThe very beginning shows a cute girl trying to wake her older brother, Kyosuke Kosaka telling him she has done nice gestures like fixing him breakfast, just like another ecchi/harem/moe/whatever else belongs there typical anime, but instead her brother becomes angry saying my sister is never this nice, you're a fake, and \"My little sister can't be this cute!\"\\n\r\nThat was only a dream and that is only like the first one or two minutes of the first episode, and he's right, I don't think anyone would think she's actually that \"cute\" as I learned as I continued to watch this anime, and I just can't help but to feel punk'd haha. Though IT WAS AWESOME! ^ ^\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation/Character 10.10 and 10/10\\n\r\nVery well animated with excellent character designs,Not really something I expected since I thought it would have been older, low graphics, qualities. But looks like I was wrong.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nDespite the series bringing up several controversial points which are likely to get people interested, it is lacking in one major area: plot. Since the anime itself brings up the issue of plot vs character, I thought it would try to cater to both. Unfortunately, the series does not have much story going on. Most of the time is spent with Kyousuke trying to figure out how to fix Kirino\u2019s problems, and events from previous episodes are usually of little importance to subsequent ones. This leads me to another issue that was brought up in Oreimo: anime series that are 12 or 13 episodes long usually have stuff cut out and/or are incomplete. Oreimo is based on a series of light novels which are still incomplete, which probably explains why there was no real story in the anime.\\n\r\nOreimo is not an anime that everyone would enjoy. It is heavily targeted at an audience that is already familiar with all things anime-related from different genres and memes, to the wide range of merchandise, comiket, anime production, and even what the streets of Akiba look like. If you like anime for its characters and are fully versed in all things related to anime, then Oreimo would probably be a good series to watch. Conversely, anyone looking for an engaging plot or anyone who\u2019s only a casual anime viewer would best avoid this series.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, well.... I'd also give an over 10/10 \\n\r\nWell in short...Guess it really isn't short but mostly what I think about it.\\n\\n\r\nOre no Imouto is an entertaining and cute comedy that was thoroughly pleasant almost every moment. Those are basically the 2 things it offers, cuteness and comedy. But what makes it special is the unique brand of tsundere that the main female character, Kirino, possesses. The story is shown from the viewpoint of her brother, Kyousuke, which allows you, the viewer, to also be on the receiving end of Kirino's cuteness, which is particularly cute because of the complexity of her relationship with Kyousuke.\\n\\n\r\nThe main female characters look unbelievable cute, sound cute, and behave cutely, and it's a sexy-cute, not a childish cute. The cuteness doesn't feel forced at all. It just naturally exudes from their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nI snicker and giggle the whole way through because it's very funny, just the kind of humor I love. There's no slapstick, gags, or chibi transformations, which tend to be mildly funny at best. This is quality humor.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not all humor. The experiences they have and problems they overcome feel good to watch, and they haven't felt forced so far. Rather, they are quite natural.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are wonderful. They seem very real. The main characters, Kyousuke, the brother, and Kirino, the sister, have a very believable relationship where they sort of act like they just \"tolerate\" each other, yet very much do care for each other and both know it, but coming out and saying it bluntly would be embarrassing. It's really a very common type of sibling rivalry/relationship.\\n\\n\r\nUnderstanding this relationship is key to your enjoyment of the show. It seems many viewers don't understand this and so they think that Kirino is an unrealistically ungrateful bitch and her brother unrealistically puts up with it without complaint. But ironically, if you understand that they are really just pretending to only just \"tolerate\" each other, but really care about each other, this is what makes the show very unique and realistic. And it's why Kirino is so darn cute. So try to understand this while watching, and look for the hidden message or vibe that Kirino is sending even when she acts angry, and never take her \"mean\" act literally.\\n\\n\r\nKyousuke is a great character, and seems to act just how I would want him to act. He's cool, reliable, sharp, and witty. Kirino is a tsundere-type character, but doesn't seem at all like a cliche. Kyousuke will sacrifice himself for his sister, which makes for some great moments as it breaks down Kirino \"defenses\" and forces her to acknowledge her brother's sacrifices with a grudging but sincere \"thanks\". The other characters have strong personalities as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe colors in the animation are bold and detailed, and camera angles and viewpoints are always keeping it fresh. The music complements the scenes very well, often breaking into the great \"theme song\" during feel-good resolutions of Kirino's problems when both Kyousuke and the viewers are rewarded with Kirino's cute fighting spirit or her grudging show of gratitude. It actually feels on par with an epic climatic scene in some lengthy drama.\\n\\n\r\nTowards the end of the series, there were some things I didn't like. The transition from one scene to another was sometimes very sudden, and some details that were important for the next scene were not sufficiently explained, almost like they were short on time and had to condense things. This happens in the last two episodes. In fact, the climatic moment in the final episode is extremely sudden, has no foreshadowing that I can see leading up to it, isn't clear whether it is intentional or accidental on the part of Kirino, and leaves me to have to wonder and speculate about what Kirino's thought's were leading up to the moment. I feel like Kirino should have shown signs that she was dealing with a tough dilemma, then we would then wonder what it was, and then the climatic moment would provide the answer. But as it is, it just leaves me puzzled.\\n\\n\r\nBut overall, this was one of my favorite shows. It was hilarious, cute, and the best part is the unique personality of Kirino that is full of cute subtleties which I can easily relate to. Not your typical tsundere.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a cute though weird awkward anime. It is also an epic plot thing at the end making you want more cute things happening.",

            "content": "\"Don't mix the 2D world with the 3D world.\"\r\nOre no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai, or Oreimo for short (which I will be calling that from now on) is an odd duck of an anime if you ask my personal opinion... you'd have to watch it yourself in order to understand why however, because it's honestly kind of a hard anime to explain. Even now, I'm having a hard time thinking about what to type. I might as well start the review right now, but I can say for certain that I did enjoy Oreimo a lot though... so let's get this reviewstarted.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about our everyday high school student, Kyousuke. Average overall. Average grades, average looks, average life. However, the only thing abnormal about his life is his little sister, Kirino. Kirino is perfect in everything. Whether it's sports, school, or beauty, she's got it all. For ages, the two have been on bad grounds with each other. She ignores him, he doesn't bother her, they're practically strangers. One day, however, she drops a DVD while she's heading out the door. BUT, not just any DVD, an ANIME DVD! (Cue the gasps) What might his perfect sister be doing with an anime in her bag? Later on, it's discovered that she's a complete otaku with a hidden closet literally filled with anime, eroge, and figurines. Kirino asks Kyousuke to keep everything a secret so it doesn't ruin her reputation. Like the good person he is, he accepts and decides to keep her secret. Throughout the series, they go through a lot. She asks him for advice, he helps her with whatever scheme she's got up her sleeve... Overall it was a pretty average story line. You might see this in a lot of other animes, so don't expect anything amazingly unique, but it was really interesting to watch the story progress.\\n\\n\r\nOreimo was brought to you by the company AIC Build, who was known for the ever so popular series, Haganai and... well, that's it I guess. But, even if they haven't made many animes in the past, their art style was definitely Grade A material. The animations were smooth and I liked the detail put into making it. Some of the characters were a bit bland, but overall it had a nice vibe to the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was awesome. We had some really good voice actors like Yuuichi Nakamura and Ayana Taketatsu playing the lead roles, and some other voice actors like Kana Hanazawa, Hitomi Nabatame and Satomi Satou playing some of the supporting characters. I liked the work they put into their characters and it paid off in the end.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it all comes down to the characters. For starters, let's talk about the main characters. First off, we have Kyousuke. As I previously stated, he's your average high school student. I mean average in everything. However, his personality is what I really liked about him. He was funny and trustworthy pretty much the entire series, and I look for that in main characters. Then there's our next protagonist, Kirino. She's a Tsundere, no doubt. She's bossy, mean a lot of the time, but I like her character as well, just because she shows as much enthusiasm about her eroge as I do my anime. I can relate to her in a lot of ways if I stop to think about it. Now, on to our supporting characters. We got Kuroneko, which was my personal favorite character in the series, mainly because she's dark and mysterious, but she's super cute and funny as well. Then we have Saori, the one character who reminds me a lot of Mayoi from Acchi Kocchi for some reason... ah yes, both their personalities and voice actors are exactly the same... but she was a good character. Last we have Manami, the supporting character that gets the least amount of time for such an important character for some reason. She's definitely the kind of girl who would seem like the childhood friend type. A good addition to the anime. An interesting choice of characters, but a good one at that.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed Oreimo. It was super funny, and I loved how at one point in the anime, Kyousuke and I had perfect synchronization when it came to spitting out our drinks after one of the characters said \"reservation for vageena\". I laughed so hard I was crying. As a true fan of anime, I had to give this a try due to a lot of the hype it was getting. I'm glad I did and I'm just starting the second season right now. As for recommendations, if you liked Haganai then you might enjoy this one.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

            "content": "Most definitely one of the most misjudged shows I've ever had the pleasure of watching. Often times people ignore this show due to the title implying an incestuous story, which does have a slight hovering presence over the show itself, but isn't actually a major point the show tries to push.\r\nStory-wise, the show dictates the relationship that develops between a brother and his little sister; albeit by the end of the first season it does not appear romantic. In fact, most of the show's first season doesn't delve into the romance genre with much depth at all; instead it introduces and orientates the male leadcharacter into the story's setting: The world of the otaku. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style and animation are very appealing and smooth, maintaining the feeling of 'dainty' and 'cute' without dropping into the 'cringe levels' of Mo\u00e9; and also making the show pleasant to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe show boasts a unique cast of characters who make the show enjoyable. Some would view these characters as 'Mo\u00e9 Clich\u00e9s' (Gothic Loli/Chuuni, Imouto, etc.), which would be expected as those 'clich\u00e9s' essentially lay the foundation for the show's theme: Otaku culture. A good half of the cast appear to be 'Anime/Game/Manga/Light Novel fans', or 'Otakus' each different in their own fashion. It's an interesting concept to see the contrast between the different types of fans. \\n\\n\r\nTo exemplify the comparison between characters, the main female character Kirino is financially wealthy, having the ability to express her passion for her hobby through purchasing goods and material to feed her Anime and Eroge pastimes. To contrast this type of 'Rich Otaku', we are then introduced to another character 'Kuroneko' who appears less financially ample. Rather than using her money to express her passion, most of Kuroneko's 'Otaku Material' is hand-made with inexpensive methods. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, the interaction between characters makes the show enjoyable; not the actual story itself. Although a linear story does exist, and that plot in itself is interesting enough; the characters' developed relationships, and the scenarios they find themselves in, are what made this show an experience to enjoy.",

            "content": "I\u2019m avoiding arbitrary numbers since that isn\u2019t helpful in explaining what I just watched. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all seen it, pictures of an orange haired, blue-eyed girl with rosy cheeks with the obligatory \u201cworst girl\u201d stamped to it. And that\u2019s fine, we\u2019re all entitled to our tastes (unfounded though they may be), because that\u2019s what makes this community what it is for better or for worse. Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai (or Oreimo [or My Little Sister Can\u2019t Be This Cute]) is a series I was just so curious about due to the amount of \u201cKirino is a shit\u201d posts I\u2019dseen all over the internet. Now granted that type of curiosity led me to Boku no Pico in the past, so needless to say I walked into this a little more wary than usual (take that for what it is). What I got was way more than I ever expected and I can honestly say I enjoyed the series. It was fun, colorful and funny and it still felt very personable. I\u2019m avoiding the word \u2018intimate\u2019 since it\u2019d be easy to mistake my meaning due to the nature of the show.\\n\\n\r\nNow I\u2019ll get to it, it\u2019s a comedy and comedies are usually done up to the max (pushes the bounds of reality, suspend your disbelief) so that you\u2019ll laugh and oh boy is there laughter to be had. It\u2019s a show based on misconceptions and preconceived notions and seeks to challenge those expectations which makes for good comedy and drama (which was unexpected). For those of you who have read a synopsis of the show, watch it before making judgements, because a lot of the love and character of the show is beneath layers of (I guess this show is classified as harem?) what appear to be clich\u00e9s. It\u2019s easy to love due to the art and soundtrack, but the characterization (good god I love these characters) and plot are spectacular as well. The series has earned itself a reputation for having a \u201cbad tsundere\u201d as a protagonist, but I feel like that\u2019s unfair especially coming from people who\u2019ve never seen it. Draw your own conclusions, but at least watch it.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a timeless gem of a series, but it\u2019s definitely worth a watch since it\u2019s so short and while it may have ridiculous elements to it, it\u2019s still endearing.",

            "content": "Overall Grade: B-\r\nWhy I Picked This Up:  I usually enjoy AIC\u2019s works, and the first episode of this made it seems like this show had some real depth to it, being a show that commented on otaku culture and sibling relationships.\r\nWhy I Finished It: My Little Sister Can\u2019t Be This Cute changed tone around episode 4, and was no longer the same show that it was when I first watching. Still, in the end, it was a fun ride, although a fun ride with some cringe-worthy moments. I\u2019m use to AIC not having the best production values, and was expecting the same here. Instead,they went all. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but the effort was present. The art was nice, the backgrounds were incredibly detailed, the opening and closing theme changed every episode, and so worth. Part of the fun was the ridiculous number of shout-outs to the other animes and eroges.\\n\\n\r\n With the exception of Kirinio, I found myself enjoying the characters and their antics immensely. Ayase, Manami, and Kuroneko especially grew on me. I thought they were honestly funny, and made me laugh. I found it interesting how much better episodes flowed when Kirino wasn\u2019t on the scene.\\n\\n\r\nBut: There seemed to be two main flaws with \u2018My Little Sister\u2019. First, I honestly think the author had no idea what direction to take the series after the Light Novels reached episode 3. He/She had some things he/she wanted to do with the characters, but no idea what to do with the plot. I think originally, it wasn\u2019t supposed to be an incest story but the author changed his/her mind to have more material to write about. My Little Sister goes from a story with depth into a light romantic comedy of sorts\u2014though in my point of view, Kirino definitely has feelings for her brother, and he doesn\u2019t return to them.\\n\\n\r\nThe second flaw seems to be with Kirino as a character. I was tolerant of Kirino up until episode 8. The problem with Kirino is she starts off as realistic, but over the course of the series turns into a person that can\u2019t exist and is flat out ridiculous. Even when she was already straying into ridiculous category, I thought she was still relatable as a character\u2014she reminded me of an angry insecure middle school girl stuck in the hell of puberty, but she loses even that. She abuses the people around her, and never suffers for it. Furthermore, she ALWAYS gets what she wants. She never hears the world no. Jeez. Thank goodness for Kirino that\u2019s she is an unrealistic human being, if she wasn\u2019t, the degree to which she was spoiled is going to cause her problems later in life, because someone has to tell her no.\\n\\n\r\nI guess I have to include a third thing, which goes under the worst thing I have seen in anime to this point. Please, can someone purge the scene where Kyousuke tells her to be quiet due to the fact she\u2019s essentially masturbating at the top of her lungs, and his reaction from my mind forever. Pretty please?\\n\\n\r\nFourth, and finally, thanks to the author indecisiveness, one thing that I liked about the series was retracted. Kirino in the beginning explained that just because she played eroge, that it didn\u2019t reflect her real world self, stating that there\u2019s a difference between a game and reality. Except. She clearly has the hots for her brother, and throws a temper tantrum when her brother doesn\u2019t react the way a player would react in an eroge game, suggesting the opposite. What makes this irksome, is it is a negative image of eroge players in the end. And a positive image is desperately needed, and would be nice.\\n\\n\r\nWho Would I Recommend This To: I think this is a fabulous anime for siblings to watch together. Well\u2026whether it is or not, my sister asked to watch this anime with me. And I spoil her rotten.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I don\u2019t know what to say. If you like cute girls, and aren\u2019t turned off by incest I guess this would be an enjoyable anime. There are parts I\u2019m glad I saw. Yet at the same time, there are parts I wish I didn\u2019t see. I haven\u2019t decided yet if one was worth the other.\\n\\n\r\nArt: AIC went all out on this one.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: B- The characters weren\u2019t that realistic, but they were fun. Main problem was Kirino, and the fact she was the main character. Kyousuke always spoiling her got old as well.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodic Value: C  I at least enjoyed somewhat 7 of the 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Story: C- The author seemed to have a concept, but no idea what he/she wanted to do with the plot, leaving a jumbled mess.\\n\\n\r\nSetting: B",

I thought it was absolutely ridiculous to put something like this on air. she is the epitome of tsun, with the dere missing. \r\ni mean, i stuck with it thinking oh my, the dere will start to increase in percentage, but none!!! like wth, and then there was this completely alarming episode where she up and sold her story, and it was to be turned to anime?!!! \r\nanyhow, pretending for instance she was to bethe annoying herione which she omg was, and her bro was to be like the only normal one, then ya he failed!!! he was a masochistic douche. i thought ok, its fine let him just take the blows from beginning, but nothing ever changed!!! he was constantly rejected, hissed at, kicked, screamed at, and omg disrespected. at this point he should go die. \\n\\n\r\nwell, overall, i think this was really poorly done. the plot was going halewire, the art was fine, not as awesome as others *thinks 07 ghost*, the enjoyment was 1. like i skipped in some episodes because i couldn't afford to break my computer screen (will have none for replacement) and finally, the characterization was poor except for the girl with black hair who pointed out stuff, the whole watching world was thinking like seriously?? lol.  \\n\\n\r\nso if it is your intention to carry on, beware of the tsundere herione, who lacks the dere part.

            "content": "I won't go much details for the short summary of my review. Simply put, it's (story) not a bad idea, but somehow it still feels off and doesn't deliver the full satisfaction. Of course, I understand that there is also a second season and I have always watched it. Without spoiling anything much, let's go in depth about Oreimo.\r\nStory: Perhaps, the weakest link here that draw the rating below. The story is simply about two sibling a big brother and a little sister \"hating\" on each other until the big brother realizes that his little sister isn't exactly what he thought she was; hence, thetitle (he didn't expect her to be this cute). The reason why I placed quotation on \"hating\" because they actually don't hate each other. In fact, the little sister actually  likes the big brother very much, it just that, things have change when they've grown up, but that feeling has never disappear since then. Instead, we have this awkward, a bit cliches, cheesy, but can be lovable relationship between siblings that may borderlines incest. Overall, for the story portion, it's alright, because there isn't much story to it. It's not like a hero must defeat evil cliches kind of plot, but it's simply about you watching how these siblings interact each other and with other characters interfering them and whatnot. If there is an antagonist, it would probably be society itself for forbidding incest. That being said, there is no \"sex scene\" in this anime, obviously nor is there some kind of incest scene. It's just a thought between the sibling that rises that question.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Quite frankly, I am never strict about art work and animation, if they did a good job, then they did a good job. I would rate this 8 star, but since I'm a little bias, I'm going with 7 stars because it's not my type of art, but it doesn't mean that it is bad. I fine the art just fine. It didn't bother me when I was watching the show. Ecchi scenes or \"fanservice\" is actually very little to none if I could remember correctly. Surprisingly, I would thought that they would have a lot of that kind of thing. There is harem though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Again, I am quite bias when it comes to art and sound, but it was too cutesy for my liking. background music and other effects are fine though, it just opening and ending that I'm not good with.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I felt characters were real and not fake like one-dimensional, which is a good thing. But unfortunately, I liked other characters more than the two main which is the brother and sister. While, they are not terrible when it comes to personality and character traits, I felt there were more other interesting characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: While, not necessarily a comedy, it was fun and it has some hilarious moment between the siblings that gave me a nice smile and laughter. Not a bad watch for those that just want to watch something a bit casual the serious plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It's alright. Not necessarily bad, but could have been better. The manga or light novel is probably better than the anime is what I think. Usually, it is since anime tends to leave out small details that could have added to be important later on in the story.",

            "content": "\"Ore no Imouto\" is the story of a high school boy who becomes so fascinated with 'little sister' anime that he hallucinates an imaginary little sister of his own, on to whom he can project his own desires. He retains a normal and chaste relationship with this imagined character Kirino, and by projecting his sexual fantasies such that she experiences them, he maintains a degree of psychological distance from thoughts of which he's ashamed.\r\nThis construct mirrors the intended experience of the viewer, who can identify with the older brother's admirable treatment of Kirino while vicariously experiencing her desires. Concurrently, Kirino's interests are normalized by herportrayed struggle against societal nonacceptance. Kyosuke is lionized for dutifully assisting his sister Kirino, while she is consistently vindicated among family and friends regarding her certain otaku proclivities: Everyone's a winner.\\n\\n\r\nOne episode, in which Kirino argues with TV executives over their anime adaptation of her manga, reinforces this point when the producer voices skepticism over whether a 'little sister' anime with a female protagonist can be successful. The question to the viewer, whether an anime about a girl with a 'little sister' obsession would be accepted by a predominantly male fanbase, is a strikingly self-aware if not self-conscious inquiry on the part of the series' author, who has done exactly that. Of course, due to Kyosuke's noble efforts, the network yields, and Kirino gains another victory.\\n\\n\r\nOscar Wilde once wrote that \"Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life,\" but it's widely believed that he didn't watch much anime. The set-up borders on contrived, and sometimes reaches it. But the characters are unique, and the story engaging if somewhat heavy-handed. If Oscar Wilde was right, you can expect another season.",

            "content": "I started watching 2 episodes, dropped the series, and then waited a few weeks. I didn't really get into it at first, mostly because I thought that it would be a brother x sister anime. \r\nBut well, it turned out being the type of anime you watch when you need something \"light and funny\". I mean, I didn't made it my very first priority to finish the series. Sure, the story was pretty good. It shows the relationships between two siblings. What I liked about it, was that it reminds me alot of my own relationship to my siblings. We're not always nice to eachother, we fight a lot, but I love them anyway. \\n\\n\r\nThe best thing with this show - Kyousuke, the main character and older brother. \\n\r\nHe's the best older brother ever, no doubt. But his life revolves around his sister in the series, and I really like his character so I'd love a side-story or something (seriously I would watch it). Also, Kyousuke has the voice of one of my favourite voice actors~\\n\\n\r\nI had a problem with Kirino to start with, but then she's the typical tsundere younger sister. It's what make the series fun watching. And I like the fact that Kirino isn't a loner, because that's the usual image of otakus - not only in anime. She's the most popular girl in school, awesome at sports, top grades, part-time job as a model - and she has a huge obsession with eroge. \\n\\n\r\nWhat's the most interesting about this series is just the relationship between Kyosuke and Kirino. Kyousuke is obviously feeling \"not as good\" as Kirino. So when Kirino fails in the series - he can't help that he feels a bit relieved. But he always goes to help her.\\n\r\nAs he says, \"because I'm her brother\".\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was very colourful and bright, not the best of that type type though. The opening was ok, I could bear with it. But it was a bit poorly made, and didn't really match the music. The opening music was nothing that I would like to have on my phone for example. But I did enjoy the show, I mean I probably would have dropped it right away if I didn't. And here's one more thing: it's worth watching because of all the oreimo hentai doujinshis.\\n\\n\r\n                                                                       \u2667\\n",

            "content": "Oreimo was a bit of a tough sell for me at points special thanks to the interactions between lead characters/ siblings Kirino and Kyosuke. The former proved to be quite the annoying brat on a number of occasions with how she interacted with her brother and the latter was too spineless to at least try correcting his sister's behavior while trying to get used to being her cohort in her otaku fandom.\r\nConsidering this series is trying to go for the slice-of-life approach in exploring the life of an otaku like Genshiken, this series does do some things right in believably exploring life as an otaku.The series does acknowledge that being an otaku is quite frowned upon in Japanese society and the mass media paint misconceptions to the mainstream about otaku becoming criminals with exposure to anime, manga, eroge, etc. Kirino is painfully aware of this at the start of Oreimo and fears others rejecting her because of her otaku interests. The series also does a solid job of exploring life in Akihabara and attending conventions. However, Oreimo usually tries to cover elements to otaku fandom that don't come across too naturally with exploring the everyday situations faced by Kirino and other characters. Not to mention with the eroge element to Oreimo being mostly used for comedic situations, the series isn't as grounded as Genshiken in believably exploring life as an otaku.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters to the series also prove to be quite the likeable and diverse bunch with Kirino having both her \"normal\" and otaku friends, as well as Kyosuke having occasional interaction with childhood friend Manami. The series does take some time to focus on many of these characters, particularly Kuroneko in the OAVs, where we get enough sense of the type of people they are beyond their outward facade as anyone \"normal\" or as an otaku.\\n\\n\r\nBut as I've discussed above, Oreimo's two lead characters aren't exactly the easiest characters to connect with. Kirino's behavior against her brother is a bit extreme and she seems depicted as an archetypal tsundere with how easily jealous she gets of Kyosuke's interactions with other girls. I also found it to be a bit absurd that someone of Kirino's age could get access to and be interested in playing adult-rated versions of eroge games. As for Kyosuke, I got irritated at points with how easily he accepted his sister's short-fused behavior towards him.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation-wise, Oreimo is a great-looking series visually with rich color and plenty of details with scenery and character designs. Many female characters are drawn to be cute-looking which helps to enhance the likeability of the supporting characters seen throughout Oreimo. Music wise, Oreimo is notable for featuring plenty of musical tracks throughout its run, notably having a different ED song in each episode. But with many of the songs being energetic J-Pop tracks, there wasn't anything that really stuck out for me with the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Oreimo was tough for me to watch at points thanks to Kirino's behavior and while the otaku theme has its moments where I could connect with it, it isn't as smoothly developed and grounded as Genshiken. Still, the supporting cast for Oreimo were likeable enough and there were enough notable moments where I could care for what developed with the characters. This is a decent show to check out, though I still don't believe it knocks off Genshiken from its perch in delivering a quality slice-of-life title that explores life as an otaku.",

            "content": "Alright, this review is more or less based on the 8 episodes they released now and seeing how there's 4 more left I'm sure there isn't anything drastic that will happen.\r\nOn we go, so this anime isn't action or anything, rather than it's an anime based on a brother-sister relationship. Some people consider it \"Tsunderes\" seeing how the brother and sister start from not talking to each other to actually talking and \"hanging\" out more often. BUT, in my opinion, the anime title is a bit misleading. When I started watching it, I thought it would be nice to see a relationship going from badto good and \"hopefully\" to best. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that way. Trying to no spoil anything, the sister's behavior is outright bad(she treats her \"older\" brother like crap and brags a lot), more like a spoiled brat. Sure I can understand the first 3-4 episodes but the series is already on episode 8 out of 12 and the \"sister\" still treats her brother like crap. The brother who I believe the storytelling revolves around does extreme things to help his sister, and yet she doesn't do anything about it(she says thanks in one episode and that's it, don't expect anymore).\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story concept is actually good, a bad relationship between the brother and his sister turning to good progressively. It has the \"tsunderes\" feel to it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art style is clean and refreshing in my opinion. They try to make every tiny thing as detailed as possible, since the whole concept is trying to be realistic. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Well, the music fits certain scenes, which I'm ok with but there's always room for improvements.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Well, like I said before, sister is a spoiled brat, brother tries hard to convince her that he's trying to be a good bro...sister treats him like crap for the 8 episodes released already. Trust me, this could either make you love the sister(Kirino) or hater her completely. 2 episodes where she isn't at all(or rarely appears) where actually good without the \"spoiled brat\" atmosphere contaminating a good story dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Like said again and again you might love her or hater her. Up to you, really...\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This anime had a good concept but they went too far on the relationship between bro and sis. Good try, really...\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: If you aren't sure yet as to what to do, watch the first 2 episodes, if you fall in \"love\" with her, then congrats finish the series. If you got pissed at her, I suggest you drop the series immediately, because the rest of the series is more or less of the same thing.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Review out of 100. 35 for Story, 35 for Characters, 15 for Sound, and 15 for Animation.\r\nStory: (27/35) Much better than you would expect, but you need to watch the OVA's for a good ending. Has an incomplete story.\r\nCharacters (28/35) Overall pretty decent. Work very well together, but aren't anything special on their own. \r\nSound (11/15) Slightly above average. \r\nAnimation (13/15) Very well done, everything looks very fluid and bright. \r\nOverall (79/100) Will break the expectations you had for it, but aside from that there are better things to watch. \r\nAdmit it, when this show first came out you all thought it was some weirdshow about a guy trying to get with his sister. Well, you might not be all that wrong depending on how the second season turns out. But this review is only for the first season, and the first season is surprisingly decent. It isn't anything amazing, but it was a lot better than I was expecting. I was expecting incest, mixed with a harem, and as we probably know, that doesn't make for the best plot. Thankfully, there is neither in season one, and the show is a surprisingly good slice of life about two siblings trying to get along better. There isn't much more to it than that. It's pretty much about Kyousuke and Kirino and how they have become closer siblings and friends through Kirino's eroge addiction, while also helping her hide that from some of her friends (and helping her make new ones). Yeah, it's a little weird, but it's original and doesn't seem all that weird when you are watching it. You should keep in mind a few things though, there are 4 extra OVA episodes, so if the ending in episode 12 seems weird, it's because there are 4 more episodes that properly end the show. That ending is actually pretty good, but the REAL ending isn't until season two. Sadly, season two is much worse than season one, and the odds that it will turn into incest and the like also increase exponentially. So if you arent into (potential) incest and don't like stories with a \"proper\" end, you might want to steer clear of this one. The story wasn't anything special, but it gets this moderately high score for completely breaking everyone's expectations. (27/35)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters really shine in this show. Kyousuke is a pretty good main character, especially with his interactions with the rest of the cast. All the other main characters are girls and they are all pretty lovable in some way. Kuroneko is probably everyone's favorite girl, Saiori is oddly the most normal of the group, and everyone else has some stuff going for them. But the way they act around eachother is what make them shine. (28/35)\\n\\n\r\nThe production vales for this show are moderately high. The music is pretty average, maybe a little above average, but have some pretty generic pop songs as an opening and ending. (11/15) The animation on the other hand is very very good. It is really smooth and everything just looks good. No complaints here (13/15)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show will probably beat the expectations you have for it, even after reading this review. Don't get me wrong though, this show isn't anything special, and we have yet to see how good the ending is (either way, season two is quite bad as it is), but if you want an example of a show you shouldn't judge by it's title/cover, this is a good choice. (79/100)",

            "content": "Warning: this review may contain /spoilers/.\r\nAh, Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai. A mouthful of a title that means \u201cMy Little Sister Can\u2019t Be This Cute\u201d. At first, I was wary of touching this anime \u2013 precisely because of the incestuous implications of the title. But, when the anime ended, several nice reviews of it popped up, assuring that there was no incest in the show, so I decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised.\r\nOreImo, as it is more commonly known, is basically an anime of how a brother and sister grow closer in their relationship, from havingvirtually none at all to becoming closer siblings. Seventeen year old Kyousuke, the older brother, is a high school student with absolutely no interest with anything anime or \u201cotaku\u201d-related. Kirino, his fourteen year old sister, however, is a total and utter otaku \u2013 specifically for little sister eroge (erotic games). The anime is mostly meant to be a comedy, as Kyousuke is introduced to the \u201cotaku\u201d lifestyle; and it mostly succeeds at what it does. Ultimately, the anime attempts to shed a bright light on the \u201cdark\u201d life of the otaku, both open ones (such as Kuroneko and Saori) and \u201ccloset\u201d ones (such as Kirino). Most of the characters are fairly well-developed (as well-developed as you can get with a comedy such as OreImo) and relationships are consistent and well played-out.\\n\\n\r\nOre no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai is a good anime. Its main problem is that it is simply not interesting. It is not one of those anime that make you think, \u201cNoo! The episodes are way too short! I have to see what happens next!\u201d It\u2019s one of those anime that make you think, \u201cOh, it ended\u201d or possibly, even worse, \u201cWhen is this episode going to end?\u201d The anime lacks a gripping plot. While it is a tad original, and while the situations and characters are easily identifiable to, it is simply not interesting enough to render a rating over five stars. I practically had to push myself to watch all twelve episodes. Sure, it is funny and has some comedic moments, and yes, I did empathize with Kirino a lot (particularly with her obsession for Meruru \u2013 ahahah, Nabariii~!), but, and I stress this, it isn\u2019t interesting enough to watch in a mini-marathon. Maybe you can keep up with it for two or three episodes in a row, but after a while you just get bored and look for respite in either a more interesting anime or an entirely different activity.\\n\\n\r\nI really don\u2019t understand all the hype this anime received, as I can point out several better anime from the 2010 fall season. Then again, I suppose it all comes down to taste. It /is/ a decent show, though.",

Basically, he happens to find out his little sister's secret: she likes little sister Incest Hentai/Eroge, so for some unknown reason reason he keeps her secret and completely loses all his credibility and pride as a high class all A's student in order tokeep his sister out of trouble. She still hates him BTW, and everyone continuously treats him like shit. Even when her secret gets out, he covers for her and her best friend thinks the brother is influencing his little sister into watching anime, so she hates him with a passion. She still slap, punches or kicks him every episode. You get my point. Basically the brother is the scapegoat who gets treated like shit by everyone even though he's like the nicest guy there could possibly ever be. When the brother talks to someone even a little the response is almost sure to be: \"Die, pervert.\" I just don't find the appeal in being slapped in the face every day for helping someone, so count me out.\\n\\n\r\nI despise the characters in this anime to no end and I especially hate that little creature/sister.\\n\\n\r\nThe art on the focused people is decent, but the background needs a bit more consistency. \\n\\n\r\nI constantly hear that slapping sound effect, so I can't really grade it high.\\n\\n\r\nI CAN'T STAND HOW POORLY THE MC IS TREATED, *slap* ...sorry, that was a bit much. I mean't to say that the main character gets slapped more times than I find any comedy in this entire anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can't stand how the main character are treated to the point that I couldn't continue watching.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you could excuse me, I have some better anime to talk about.

            "content": "The cool thing about Oreimo (eng. My sister can't be this cute) is that it's smarter than it looks. It's a show riddled with commentary on the state of anime and the otaku culture. The writing pulls no punches whatsoever: while making several impassionate statements for the right of otakus to love their hobby, the script never shies away from reality. Especially central is the exploration of stigmatization by society and the role of friendship in combating it. Even when providing titillating fan service, the script of Oreimo will hit from the sidelines, referencing the market realities driving the emergent sexualization of anime and thepandering of fetish groups. Even the opening scene of the first episode is a reference to a worn-out trope; cute little sister waking up his brother. Were this the usual siscon eroge or anime, the brother wouldn't wake up to realize it was only a dream.\\n\\n\r\nThe strongest point of Oreimo is the cast of characters. Their personalities and backstories are complex and purposeful, serving to explore many themes. The scenes, camera angles and dialogue are set up flawlessly to serve their points, proving that the series is meant as a serious work of animated art. If you pay the slightest attention to the dialogue, you'll recognize it's a stream of two-layered commentary that rarely fails to reap a laugh. Whether you love or hate the current state of the anime industry, Oreimo is an easy show to love.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I didn't notice on my first watch-through is the show's careful use of camera angles: for example, when characters are arguing, the camera will be tilted to show they're emotionally off-balance. It's the same type of crazy attention to detail you find in movies like Citizen Kane, which is funny, considering the comparison.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy alone is reason enough to watch Oreimo. Even without much background knowledge on anime, you should have a good time. Or maybe you'll just be shocked at the endless darkness of the bottomless rabbit hole...",

            "content": "This is a review for both the seasons, and contains spoilers.\r\nLets start with one thing- this anime is centered around the relationship of a brother and his younger sister, and their feelings for each other, that change and develop throughout the show (very slowly if i may add). The anime also has a mention of the otaku culture and some other stuff, but the main focus is around the siblings (and otakus.. mostly since his sister is one). \r\nNow then. Why is the relationship between siblings is considered taboo in our society? Answer - mainly because of fear of of pregnancy that has a higherchance to result in a defective child. And that's an adult reason. And this anime is not an adult one. See the problem here? So yeah, this anime doesn't have the correct platform to deal with the problem it is centered around (not being adult), as well as the guts (as far as i see it) to deal with it. Therefor it DOESN'T. So basically as i see it, the main focus of the anime, is left unsolved (or solved half heartedly, as far as i see it).\\n\\n\r\nLeaving that aside, most the female characters (including the heroine) are horrible (aside from Minami and Ruru). They are violent, bad mouthed, shallow and generally obnoxious. The protagonist on the other hand is a complete wimp (at most times). He gets randomly beaten, is constantly verbally abused, and can't (or maybe doesn't) do anything about it. This leaves me with a feeling the anime was aimed at masochists.\\n\\n\r\nNow don't get me wrong, it was not that hard to watch, and i can say i somewhat enjoyed it, but the fact it has pretty much no closure, and shamelessly dismisses the main problem that was the focus of the frigging show, as well as the obnoxious violent heroines and the floor mop that is the protagonist (that pretty much got screwed over in the end too, ) just didn't leave a good feeling after i finished watching it. \\n\\n\r\nThis reminded me somewhat of \"yosuga no sora\" 's last arc, but in a bad way, since \"yosuga no sora\" tries to leave some sort of closure, and attends the problem more properly. So overall, i consider \"Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai.\" As a somewhat boring watch. I do admit it has some good moments, but considering how much things i didn't enjoy it had, i personally don't recommend it.",

            "content": "I have to be honest, I only started watching this series because many of the series I was watching ended. I only came across this series on my blog. I thought \"hey why not give it a try?\" No, I don't have a fetish for little sisters. I don't even have a sister to begin with. I digress.\r\n(SPOILER ALERT)\r\nI didn't expect much from this series then being the standard ecchi-anime. However, it was more than that. It kind of delved into the relm of your normal \"growing up/slice of life\" anime where the heroine/hero is really cold and warms up but still is cold- thecliche Tsundere anime. I saw a lot of similarity between Kirino and Taiga from Toradora. Especially in one seen where Kirino head-butts Kyosuke, Taiga does the same thing to Ryuji. Otherwise, they both take on the tsundere role. We get a little more \"cuteness\" from Kirino by the end, but still the coldness she directs towards her brother. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters seem rather dull. The one other character I found interesting was Saori. We get glimpes of her true self in some episode, but the rest of the characters are clueless as to who she really is. We get a sense of her true identity when Kirino informs Kyosuke that Saori lives far. It was safe to assume she was well off without even showing her living room in some episodes. I would also like to see more character development of Kirino and even some of Ayase. Maybe even a budding romance between Kyosuke and Manami, but from the looks of it, the creators wanted to rap up their relationship to just as \"childhood friends\" in the one episode when Kyosuke spends the night with Manami.\\n\\n\r\nI hope they do something well with the second season. I hope to write a review for that one once they complete it. Look forward to it!",

            "content": "Oreimo is something a little... different.  At first glance it appears to be another rehash of the classic brother/sister incest relationship, with some anime obsession on the side.  Oreimo, at least the first season, pulls away and offers something more sincere, with comedy at the forefront and dramatic subplots galore, and plenty of cuteness to keep you satisfied.\r\nStory: 5\r\nIt's not a particularly compelling story.  A brother and a sister who live as polar opposites, one a normal guy who wants things to remain average, the other a model, star student, athletic prodigy, and eventually a notable novelist, act coldly to each otherdue to mutual hatred.  One fateful day, the perfect, straight A student Kirino is revealed to her brother Kyousuke as an otaku, obsessed primarily in erotic adult games involving little sisters.  The story of the show revolves around Kyousuke giving Kirino advice on how to deal with making new friends that share her interests and giving her an outlet to talk about her obsession by indulging in it himself.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story isn't handled very tactfully, nor is it particularly interesting.  Removing the potential for humor/jokes, the story itself isn't compelling or particularly unique.  It's a refurbished version of the rekindling of a broken relationship through a common interest, secret, problem, goal etc.  Very little development is made, and episodes eventually drop the story altogether for a more slice of life style show.  The brother-sister relationship rekindling is replaced with a look into the struggles of otaku, who are looked down on by society.  Once again, the story here is rather lackluster, but the humor is prime.  However, comedy doesn't make for a good story, and although OreImo tries its darnedest to remind you that it can be serious every once in a while with a dramatic scene, it fights a losing battle trying to split its time between silly cuteness and otaku culture, and a serious story about siblings who come to understand each other.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe art style of the show isn't notably deviant or original, but its pleasant nonetheless.  The show offers a very stagnant style of art.  While other shows make use of multiple animation styles to portray a mood or enhance an aspect of a character (cute, serious, dumbfounded, etc.), OreImo consistently uses one style almost all the way through without resorting to the use of alternate styles to make the characters appear cuter or more serious in a scene.  This actually helps with the realistic setting the show tries to create.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the show doesn't resort to classic animation tropes (or anime tropes), such as bleeding noses, or simplified versions of the characters being used for quicker animations, or a blurred depiction of fast movement.  The characters are drawn to look and act like real people, and don't break from that.  Aside from the classic blushing lines (which are used almost constantly), the show steers clear of most other stereotypical anime art choices.\\n\\n\r\nThe show also pays a lot of attention to detail, and even offers some different opening animations almost every episode, along with different pictures at the ending of every episode.  Details like this are what push a shows art from good to very good.\\n\\n\r\nFor those reasons, and simply because the art is pleasant to look at in the first place (and since the characters are adorable), the art gets an 8.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors seemed to match their personalities well, and they did a good job.  The OP is extremely upbeat and catchy, which matches the shows atmosphere, and every episode makes use of an entirely different ending song, which is something very unique.  \\n\\n\r\nI can't say much about the background music.  While the opening and closing songs were very good, and the voice acting was prime, the background music got old extremely quick.  None of the tracks were notably special and overall they were rather average.  Best I can do is a 7.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\\n\r\nThere's a wide spectrum of characters on the show.  If I could rate each one individually they would get everything ranging from a 3 to a 10.  \\n\\n\r\nThe main male lead, a character position that is very rarely done well by romance/comedy anime, follows suit with every other wimpy male lead.  Though he's rather refreshing because he's at least sarcastic and apathetic, he's abused constantly, usually for no good reason, and doesn't retaliate, his character remains rather static for the entire show, he's portrayed as completely average and uninteresting, with no stated goals, hobbies, or interests that could give him the slightest amount of depth.  Like most other male leads, he's romantically oblivious and dense.  And, of course, his only redeeming factor is that he is occasionally kind, and occasionally sticks up for his friends.  If it weren't for the fact that he at least had a little bit of a backbone and was willing to reprimand his sister for her bullshit occasionally, he'd truly be another irredeemable, boring male lead.\\n\\n\r\nThe main female lead doesn't differ much.  Her personality is split between mega-bitch and super-cute-girl.  When it comes to anything but anime/eroge, she is a classic tsundere character, turned up to 11.  She's extremely annoying, makes no changes to her character regardless of what happens, and is generally difficult to like.  Of course, she's adorable sometimes, so she has that going for her, and at least that helps the title make sense.  There's also a sense of wish-fulfillment going on with her character.  She's a very cliche example of a character who is presented to other characters as perfect/flawless but really has a glaring oddity/flaw that makes her more relatable to people who aren't perfect/flawless.  She complains often, is annoying, and makes little to no development unless the director happens to want some sort of drama to happen.  This personality is critical to the show, since any other personality wouldn't have made the story work, but is extremely dissatisfying to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is mostly enjoyable, with a few gems that really stand apart from the rest of the cast.  I don't have the time or motivation to write an individual analysis of each one to give you a better idea of what the cast of characters in this show is like, but the personalities are varied and there's something for mostly everyone.  Even though the two leads don't always cut it as far as good characters go, characters like Ayase, Manami, and Kuroneko show that the writers do actually know how to write a character that isn't incredibly irritating to watch or unbearably average/boring with questionable motivations that don't always make sense.  The moe is strong with all the characters, however.\\n\\n\r\nIf it weren't for the strong supporting cast, the show would have flunked as far as characters go.  As the show goes on, Kirino and Kyousuke become more bearable and make a good comedic duo with their sparring personalities.  There is at least some good to come out of their extreme personalities.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe show is funny, there's not much else to note here.  Neither the drama nor the romance is particularly enjoyable, other shows do it much better.  The story isn't very interesting or engrossing, but offers situations in which the characters can interact in hilarious ways.  \\n\\n\r\nAt its core, the show takes a bunch of adorably cute characters (and the male lead) and puts them in situations where they have to deal with each others' differing and sometimes clashing personalities as well as with the challenges of being obsessed with something society looks down upon.  Overall, the humor of the show is the best part, and makes the other, lesser aspects of the show bearable.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe show almost does a lot of things.  It almost offers an endearing story about how a brother and a sister rekindle their relationship through the odd common factor of erotic adult games involving little sisters.  It almost offers a full cast of interesting, fun characters with believable personalities that interact in realistic ways.  It almost executes jokes without repeating the same ones over and over again.  It almost keeps the characters personalities from going overboard for the sake of quick comedy.  It almost creates realistic situations in which the characters act in accordance to their personality without resorting to dumbing down a character or changing the way they act to make a story work.  It almost offers great comedy without interference of lackluster drama and unneeded plot points.  But it doesn't quite reach there.  The show could have been great, but it makes a lot of mistakes.  \\n\\n\r\nThere's two ways you can go about the show taking into account these mistakes.  You can either get caught up in them and hate the show, or you can ignore them in favor of laughing at the jokes and choking over the adorable characters and overall cuteness.  Personally, I couldn't forgive the mistakes completely, but I easily ignored them in favor of a good laugh while watching.  The show could have been great, but it remains only good because of this.  \\n\\n\r\nI definitely recommend the show, but your enjoyment of it really depends on you sense of humor (this show deals mostly with character interaction for its source of humor and light quips about otaku culture) and how much you'll get caught up in the poor aspects of the show and its mistakes.",

            "content": "A bit of hope.\r\nI went into this anime with a bit of hope that it wasn't going to be as cliche as it looked. \r\nI was mistaken. Terribly mistaken in fact.\r\nStory: 5\r\nI didn't have high hopes before watching this series. However, the first three episodes made me think that maybe this anime could turn the \"little sister\" anime trope on it's head. Would it portray a interesting and meaningful story about two siblings who don't see eye to eye? That's what I thought. Needless to say, it went downhill...\r\nWhile the first three episodes were very good, like 8/10 good, they still kept a few ofthe cliches that this kind of genre often has. That should've have signaled what was to come. After the first three episodes, the show eventually stopped trying. It became less about a brother trying to help his little sister while still trying to consider her point of view into a big brother doing literally anything his sister asks. What makes it even worse? The ending throws all of it out of the window. Any remaining hope must have taken a flight to a foreign land and never returned. Literally.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the story could have ended after the first three episodes, and I would have enjoyed it a fair amount.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nAs this series came out in 2010, it resembles a 2000's anime much more than a more recent series. Nevertheless, it's bland and lacks creativity. All of the characters look stiff and literally every female character has a blush. Always. Literally. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, bland. The opening and ending didn't stick with me. Normally, I'll watch the opening to a series for every episode, but if I did that with this one, I'd feel like I was wasting my time. Same thing for the ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I'd like to rant about this, I'll keep it short.\\n\\n\r\nKirino - For the first half of the series, she was tolerable. After that, however, she became ridiculous. I get what the creator was going for, but there's a difference between \"little sister who's ungrateful and needy\" and \"tsundere\". In this case, both were thrown together and it was called a day.\\n\\n\r\nKyousuke - The only \"good\" thing about this series. At the very least, he's somewhat funny and is easy to sympathize with due to the absurd things he's put through. Even if you don't like his character, he is involved in a few funny gags.\\n\\n\r\nKirino's two friends are mostly harmless. Her modeling friend is decent, albeit one-note. Manami is easily the worst. She serves little to no purpose, is even more irritating than the little sister, and is only used when the show has to fill time.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the characters completely deplete this show of any chance at redeeming itself.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, I really liked the first few episodes. After that, I only watched it since I was trying to fill my \"completed\" section on my anime list. Otherwise, I would have dropped it. To be fair, every episode probably has one or maybe two funny gags, but that's pushing it. The show also attempts fan service, but fails every single time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\\n\r\nIn order to like this series, you have to be of a rare kind. To bother watching it in the first place, you have to be desperate. At best, it's a distraction. I'd say that you could watch the first three episodes, leave, and be satisfied. Everything else just ruins an already questionable basis.",

However, a disclaimer would be that this show is very subjective, and many people have contrasting opinions on this series.\r\nStory 4/10\r\nThe story in itself was decent, with an exaggerated but accurate portrayal of the ups and downs of having a sibling. The depiction of \"otakus\" and how the public viewed them was interesting and thought-provoking. However, using the same rinse and repeat formula throughout the 12 episodes was a mistake.

He would make the finest of doormats but is surprisingly self-sacrificial.\\n\r\nKirino fulfils and goes beyond the \"tsundere\" archetype, with an extra serving of attitude. She fails to obtain proper development as she shies away from any responsibility in the face of adversity, having her brother as a neat tool to sweep up the mess. The outcome is an ambitiously complex character with no growth whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\n2) The relationship between brother and sister still develops, despite Kirino's tsundere personality hindering it. The other characters failed to have any depth in their relationships with the main characters.\\n\\n\r\n3) The supporting cast were all interesting characters, but the anime did not draw out their full potential.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 3/10\\n\r\nBeing brutally honest, the repetitiveness and overbearing personalities made OreImo painful to watch for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\r\nOreImo had tonnes of potential but failed to capitalise.

It's a cliche of the games that Kirino loves so dearly. What kept me interested was wondering how long could either of one them stand being friends before Kyousuke bitterness gets in the way and/or Kirino's confesses the real reason she's into anime and games with incest themes. The plot would introduce something interesting and then not follow up on it then do it again in the next episode. Kirino modeled the story didn't follow up on how that was affecting her anime hobby or how itcould have affected her self esteem always expecting to be beautiful. Saori hosted those anime parties how come Kirino didn't go back or Saori mention it? It hinted at Manami liking Kyousuke, how come she didn't pursue him? Kirino had a manga published, they didn't want a second series? Was offered her story to be turned into an anime, did it ever go through? How was it received? Saori was really more than she looked, she didn't want to disclose to her new found friends her other side? Yes, she was anime fan but she was someone else when the glasses off, they could have went into that deeper. It would have been nice to show that Kirino wasn't the only one who didn't fit the physical appearance stereotype of an otaku.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSince it's a cliche and is about an otaku. It does explore the different aspects of the otaku world. Kirino meets other otakus, goes to an convention, participate in the online world of otaku, writes her on stories, frequent the known otaku spot to buy her some content. There also some cosplaying as well. So it didn't neglect the otaku theme of the story for that I will rate the story 7/10 ( 7 meaning good). Although it didn't present any real drama it did n't neglect Kirino embracing and expanding her anime and eroge interests.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nForm of Development/Pace: Moved along pretty well however it would leave material they introduced behind. Side stories/Extra Space: No side stories, no fillers. However some of Episode 11 was so lame that it felt like a filler. How is a party 4 people? Please explain this. Believable: Yes. Conclusion: It ended well for what it presented through out the series. It didn't really leave any doors open for a return.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art was wonderful. It had beautiful and very detailed backgrounds, great color scheme that shaped the anime, hair shine eye details,etc. There isn't really anything to complain about the artwork. There wasn't one episode where I felt it was slacking. It flowed with the music as well. I give the artwork an 8, 8 meaning very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nNo annoying voices, all were fitting to the their characters (for future reference I watched the subbed version). The beginning theme song is bouncy and cute. The background music was fitting. This anime had theme songs and I didn't listen to all of them so what I did hear it flowed with the anime. I give the sound an 8, 8 meaning very good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nKyousuke changes for the better. He actually compromises his bitterness to be there for Kirino. Kirino on the other hand is a different story. No significant progress for her. She was nice at Kyousuke at times but was it really to be nice or was it for her not to push him over the edge to where he would retreat to being distant? I give the artwork an 6, 6 meaning fine.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed it. It had it's funny moments and I enjoyed watching Kirino embrace her dorky side.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt averages to 7.4 out of 10 so I'm going to drop it down to 7.Although Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai didn't really delve deep into the drama aspect, it displayed an anime fan embracing the otaku world in a funny and enjoyable way.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend to someone else?\\n\r\nI would recommend this to someone who is a sucker for cute anime and can handle the awkwardness of Kirino liking her brother...and eroge.",

            "content": "This is a show about all-around perfect human being Kousaka Kirino. It also happens to be a harem romance about incest, but Kousaka Kirino is so wonderful that you will forget that, even if you are the kind to unironically employ the word \"squicky\" in reference to this show. Perhaps about midway through the first season, you may notice Kousaka Kyousuke being gradually encroached upon by numerous attractive young women who are not his unfathomably smart and beautiful sister. If your childish mind cannot appreciate the marvel that is Kousaka Kirino, you might realise it earlier\u2014for example, when fan favorite Kuroneko/Gokou Ruri shows up tosperg about her chuunibyou Type-Moon-style anime and degrade the true spirit of moe. To those who like her, I happily concede that she is a charming and likeable girl whose very solid characterisation is in line with the surprisingly above-average writing on display throughout Oreimo. Hopefully, she will soon grow out of her chuuni phase and aspire to Kousaka Kirino's divine grace.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you're not being awed by the outstanding physical and personal qualities of Kousaka Kirino, you may observe that this show manages to straddle the line between playing to archetype and crafting unique and likeable characters. Sadly, few possess the shrewd mind and keen aesthetic awareness of someone like, for instance, Kousaka Kirino, and it's all too easy to dismiss this as merely a incest-themed distraction for lonely otaku, ignoring the bright, warm art and animation, not to mention the well written dialogue. The characters are given depth and believable interiority over the course of the show, rather than staying static, as can be the tendency in harem romance\u2014for example, Kuroneko's little sister is introduced several episodes in, and we also see her living conditions in the same episode. It's refreshing to see her outside of the context of otaku stuff, interacting with someone close to her who isn't Kyousuke, or that platonic ideal of homo sapiens sapiens, Kousaka Kirino.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the first season, Kousaka Kirino bestows upon the humble viewer a vision of her noble passion for moe. She draws her brother into her empire of eroge, writes a novel that wows the populace and gets immediately adapted into an anime, and through her generous condescension allows everyone around her to recognise her as the rightful centre of Oreimo's world. Those heretics who do not acknowledge Kousaka Kirino as a benevolent goddess of moe come to earth in human form may find the story uninteresting or even irritating as a result, though they ought to be censured for such thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the second season doesn't have quite the same spark as the first, but those truly appreciative of Kousaka Kirino will still find satisfaction. One way or another, Oreimo is one tasty cookie if you approach it with appropriate expectations. Even if you haven't yet given in to the miracle of Kousaka Kirino, you'll probably still like Kuroneko, for what it's worth.",

            "content": "Despite the rumors going around the internet, don't be intimidated by this anime, just because they say it's ecchi or there's incest in it. There's only 1 scene in the entire first season that's questionable at worst, but hey, you are probably used to it by now. This is anime afterall - it tends to be weird from time to time. Rest assured it does remain a healthy sibling relationship so don't worry (at least in the 1st season).\r\nHowever, they are not kidding when they say the main character is 200% tsundere. For the majority of the anime she is outright hateful. It's not justa simple \"It's not like I'm doing this for you, b-b-baka...\" It's more like a \"I will punch you in the face until you start bleeding\" (actually happened). I really dislike her. The other main character (her brother) is... well, a really, really, REALLY good older brother. Considerate. Responsible. Caring. Always looking out for his little sister. Endures even the greatest of shame for her. He puts up with an incredible amount of her sh!t (personally, I'd have taught her \"discipline\" five times over in every episode). \\n\\n\r\nI've come to find the rest of the characters much more entertaining. Especially Manami's grandparents! They put up quite the show!\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves mostly around the tsundere little sister. There's not much of a story to begin with though. Just random parts of young people's life. Exactly what you would expect from a slice-of-life anime. You watch this because you are bored and you want to stay bored.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT: After watching the 2nd season, you might want to just end it right at the end of the 1st season's specials. I really don't recommend watching more than that. First of all, second season is where the incest is. But that's not really the problem, is it? You expected this at some point. We all did. Even if you (like me) didn't ship the two siblings.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that it becomes a way too simple. Suddenly all the girls turn into magnets. That's right, it becomes a harem anime... just without all the interesting complications of a harem. A harem story is not inherently bad. It can be done well (Haganai comes to mind).\\n\r\n*SPOILER*\\n\r\nSee, the main character turns everyone down. Although questionably noble from the guy, I don't even see the place for it in this anime. It was completely unnecessary.\\n\r\n*SPOILER END*\\n\\n\r\nSave yourself the trouble, stop watching here. These 13-16 episodes are more than enough. You have a nice and healthy brother-sister relationship brewing. It's relaxing. Don't ruin this for yourself.",

I almost dropped the anime at the 12th episode, because I wasn't really getting anything from it. But luckily, I did not drop it. And I'm glad I didn't. Kinda.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe story is about two siblings who absolutely didn't give a shit about eachother, then, well, the brother, Kyousuke Kosaka bumped into Kirino, his sister, one day and she drops anime and somehow doesn't notice and leaves. Kyousuke is like \"bitch this is mine now\" and mentions itat the dinner table. Kirino barges into Kyousuke's room at night and is like, \"Bitch, I slap you, gimme my anime bak\", and then is like \"come to my room baka\" and Kyousuke's like... \"aight then\" and this is the most stupid explanation of a story ever. Anyway, after that, Kirino shows Kyousuke all her anime and eroge for some reason, if it were me, I'd personally keep that eroge hidden for ever. Don't want anyone to see that. And then, after that, the siblings get closer together (for some reason, no idea why) closer than they've been in years. Logic, anime no give shit about it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe most least disappointing thing about the anime. The art style is very good, and, well, it's good, 'kay? Don't judge me. I don't really have much other things to say.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was okay. There wasn't much scenes where there was actually music playing in the background, or I wasn't paying attention, so all I knew that was good was the opening to the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThey're okay. I don't really like Kirino, but everyone else is okay. Why don't I like Kirino? Beats me. Can't explain it, she just gets on my nerves, I don't know why. I do, but I cannot explain it, for I have eighteen pages of explanation to do. You want that? Neither do I. Out of all the characters, Ruri is probably my favorite out of all of them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI didn't get what I expected from this anime, wait... what the hell did I expect? I have no idea, maybe I expected cute girls beating up Kirino, I don't know, that's actually kinda weird and abusive, I might get fired from saying that. That said, my favorite part about Kirino isn't really anything. I would say something... but nah. I don't really have a favorite part about her. You don't agree with me, well....\\n\\n\r\n*runs out door*",

            "content": "I'll say, despite my extreme dislike of the character called Kirino Kousaka, I loved the anime OreImo. You can love an anime for what it is, but hate a character in the anime for who he/she is. \r\nThe story is simple. A brother and a sister are too different from each other and they don't get along, until the brother comes across one of his sister's eroge games and since then, his sister becomes a big part of his life. The story may be simple, but it is very entertaining since it explains things about being an otaku and what they usually do. And inthis anime, they used a different approach to make it very fun to watch and to keep your eyes glued to the screen. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is good. I see no animation error or such, and the appearance of the characters define their overall personality. I don't have problem with the art at all. But it isn't the gem of this anime. The sounds are ok too. I don't actually pay much attention to it, but I did love to OP theme and the many ending themes. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters. Oh, I love some of them and I hate some of them. Why? Because of the kind of people they are. Kyousuke is one of the two main characters who is your typical average guy. But he isn't plain in a way that it's boring. In fact, I can't help but sympathize with him every time he gets bullied by his sister. Oh, Kirino. As much as she's the titular character, I have to admit she is not a little sister that I would like to have, at all. I'm sure a lot thinks the same. There are a lot of little sisters in anime who are portrayed as tsundere, but she is just too extreme that her personality borders on being more than just bitchy.\\n\\n\r\nHer best friend, Ayase is also kind of irritating once you get to know the kind of person she really is. While Ayase may seem very sweet and gentle at first, you come to know that she is the kind of person who has little tolerance for otakus and still holds on the belief that her friend is not one. She couldn't even bring herself to, at the very least, accept that Kirino is an otaku and just put up with it if she really hates otakus that much. \\n\\n\r\nThe others are good. I love Kuroneko. She is a thousand times, no - a million times better than Kirino. She may be intense in terms of the way she talks and acts, but unlike Kirino, she is not mean. She just likes to tease people for amusement's sake. She is rather, misunderstood at times. But deep down, she is kind and caring and is kind of insecure. \\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, OreImo is a very good anime. It's a great of comedy, slice-of-life (otaku-wise), drama, and romance. Even though it may have its share of particularly nerve-grating characters, it can be overlooked by all the other elements of the anime. I assure to those who read this that it's a very fun watch.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I had seen the series mentioned around the web. I figured it was pretty popular (with mostly Kirino in the images, parodies, etc.) And I finally decided to watch it.\r\n    Indeed, Kirino is definitely a bratty middle schooler like everyone says; pulling Kyousuke into the matter was the spark to this story. From there, the relationship went through many ups and downs as the story progressed, making the plot unpredictable (which I like). The variable plot is really what made me want to watch the entire series.\r\n    The story definitely utilized every character. Kuroneko andsome of Ayase. The others came in by the second season. And I found it refreshing when the relationship between Kuroneko and Kyousuke progressed. In fact, I wanted them to stay together!\\n\r\n    It might not be the anime for everyone since there are always obstacles in the plot that could do without, but I'm okay with it.\\n\r\n    The first season did a good job in portraying daily life as well, making the characters more dynamic than an average ecchi anime.\\n\r\n    So I truly recommend watching this one if you are into slightly ecchi anime with a plot that leads to a meaningful ending.\\n",

Oriemo was actually to my surprise a pretty good anime.\r\nStory:8 \r\nThe story Oreimo follows a brother and sister who are pretty distant from each other. The sister is a perfect student and athlete who is also a model. However there is one thing she likes alot, her eroge and anime. The brother finds this out and the story rolls from there on out. The story is pretty consistent with the plot and theme. But in the later episodedoes a ballzy move that later on kinda works out, and i give props to them for it.\\n\\n\r\nArt:7\\n\r\nIt is your basic art with fluid animation\\n\\n\r\nSound:9 \\n\r\nThe opening and endings were up beat and sounded great. Made by Claris, the same people who made nisekoi's op and eds. The songs were very catchy and remeberable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nThe characters in Oreimo weren't as unique as other anime bot still held their grounds. Kiniro and gokou or kuroneko's interactions were new and fresh. The rest of the cast were ok and did do their part in the story quite well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9 \\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching Oreimo. It was fresh, fun, and had me laugh the whole time. The comedy in this anime was top notch, even besting konosuba in comedy for me. The story had me lured in, and when they dropped an unsuspected wrench in the story, i was on the edge of my seat. If you like comedy or slice of life anime, this definitely is the show for you. If you want more romance, Oreimo can still deliver  what you need.",

You get to see how Kirino slowly opens up to being a otaku and how she meets new friends. The anime really does well on introducing new characters.

            "content": "Note: this is a review for season 1 only, written prior to any viewing of season 2.\r\nGiven it's title, it's only natural to walk into Oreimo with the fear of it being shallow and perverted. Thankfully, it isn't, but I almost wonder if the creators themselves tried too hard to avoid that. \r\nOreimo's opening episode starts out the series with promise. We start by seeing that Kyousuke and his little sister Kirino, aren't in the best of sibling relationships. Kyousuke is annoyed at the way Kirino ignores him and is nasty to him. It's clear he wants to be on better terms with her. Thedoor to that is opened too, when Kirino confesses her secret hobby to him: she's obsessed with Meruru and, in particular, the little sister eroge games from it. Oreimo handles this well, as such a thing could easily serve as the preface to a hentai scene. Instead, we see only some very subtle and slight sexual tension. Because we don't see Kirino's thoughts, and only brief bits of Kyousuke's, it's unclear if either is actually attracted to the other. This simply lurks underneath the bigger focus of the episode: Kirino's shame in her hobby, Kyousuke's acceptance of it, and the ensuing bond that comes from it. At the end, Kirino tells Kyousuke to play one of the games, and there's even a rather funny bit where he begins.\\n\\n\r\nSo it sounds promising right? Based on this pilot I fully expected Oreimo to tackle the brother-sister dynamic in an interesting way. It looked like Kyousuke was going to join into Kirino's hobby out of a desire to get closer to his sister, but that maybe some sexual tension would lead to huge problems. \\n\\n\r\nBut nope, nope, nope. Instead Kyousuke just kind of plays the game a few times without any consequence. He finds Kirino other otaku friends to help her out, and I'm honestly not sure what they contribute to the plot. Granted, they both work somewhat as characters, but for the most part they hardly even interact with Kirino and do little to nothing to develop her character.\\n\\n\r\nOreimo is one of many animes that also seems to believe in doing soft resets at the beginning of each episode. Conflicts introduced in one episode very rarely are addressed in later episodes, either because they have already been \"solved\" in a rushed fashion, or because the show apparently just forgot about them. This further compounds Oreimo's central weakness: IT DOESN'T MOVE ANYWHERE. Basically every episode is just a weekly example of how Kyousuke can help out his little sister. The only exception is a hodge-podge addition where he hangs out at a childhood friend's house, which is honestly worse as there is no clear reason why it's important to see. In the end the result is largely the stale story of a white knight male helping out a tsundere female, with the only notable distinguishing feature being that it's brother and sister.\\n\\n\r\nThe incestous aspect of this show could have made it interesting, but that wasn't the case. Occasionally the show attempts to use it for slight of hand tricks, but in such cases it's always executed poorly. For the most part, it's just a running joke that doesn't lead to any actual consequences for the characters, which leads into another point I'd like to make: Oreimo pretty much sucks at making good on the conflicts it teases. For example, in the very first episode Kyousuke finds the little sister eroge DVD and suddenly realizes, \"This is the one thing I really shouldn't own!\" and expresses fear for what would happen if his parents found out. Later, his dad finds out and doesn't give a shit, nor does anyone else who discovers this \"hobby\".\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, a frequent annoyance I had was how often the characters didn't behave honestly as human beings. Kyousuke's confrontation of his father was simply a bizarre interaction. Very often it felt that people simply behaved in dishonest ways to move the story how the creators wanted it to be moved. \\n\\n\r\nThe only thing more dishonest than the characters are the creators of this show. It sets viewers up with the expectation that it'll largely be about a brother-sister relationship, with the eroge/anime simply being a catalyst of sorts. Instead, it spends most of its time being an apologist for otaku culture. I don't hate otaku's or anything, but it's disappointing that Oreimo more or less just tries to shout at us to accept them. The point could've been brought across in a much better way. Furthermore, they spend way too much time on it. As a result the show basically ends up being about Kirino's hobby and Kyousuke finding ways to help her with it, which trust me, somehow manages to be even more bland than it sounds.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps I should move on to the positive things about this show. It is beautifully animated. The visual aspects of it look very good, there's some cool variation in what we see in it's OP, even. It's no masterpiece; there are many times when little sets it apart from a typical slice of life anime. But it's mostly very, very good. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, for all its flaws, Oreimo manages to be a mildly sweet story about how a brother comes to love his little sister (no, not that way). The final episode is well-done and does leave the viewer with some sense of feeling and closure. It's just that such feelings would have resonated much more strongly if their delivery mechanism hadn't been so predominantly generic. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd probably be lying if I said I'm not going to check out Season 2. Why? Because Oreimo does have potential. That much was clear to me. It just committed a slew of errors in execution that couldn't be ignored. I'm going to be optimistic and hope that things were better strung together in S2. I'll probably be wrong but that's fine I guess. \\n\\n",

            "content": "This show is very polarizing and controversial in nature, which has made it subjected to hatred and praise. It is what I call, what revolutionized the \"little sister\" stereotype in anime, it was not the first, but it was probably one of the biggest influencers. Looking at all the reviews for this show, it is widely excepted that this is not a masterpiece, certainly not, so why I have not started bashing this work. Let me explain, this show is basically a slice-of-life romance comedy, with some drama, harem, and \"incest\" mixed into one. I personally found that this show had some good and badpoints. Not certainly deserving of the hatred it has received, but isn't as good from the praise. Lets analyze every aspect of this show, and than I will explain my opinion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5 - This is a 5, which means that the story was mediocre. Watching this show made me realize, this has very inconsistent writing. The themes and subject matter that each episode tries to touch on have a varying effect on me. From finding it interesting because of character development, or complete boredom from the waste of time. The plot isn't complicated or hard to understand. It is just not deeply layered or well though out enough to make it deserve a higher score.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6 - This show has solid art, nothing like Kyoto or P.A Works. But it's visually pleasing, and isn't really anything to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5 - The music is fine, it fits with the show, nothing more and nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7 - The characters were actually very decent, with pretty great backstories to help develop most of the cast of characters. Some were done better than others, but it helps you to understand the motivations and actions of the characters. The characters were also one of the best parts of this show. It made me laugh a lot! Which is hard to say for newer shows today. It also liked to comment on otaku culture and referenced akihabara. Which was something I didn't see as much during that time. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 - I personally found this show really funny and hilarious. I get it, some jokes get really old. But the character interactions are actually really great. I watched this show personally because it was hated on so much. I was curious, and while I understand the severe criticisms. I believe that it is overused and people just like to ride on it. I didn't watch this show for the romance. If you did, than you might be disappointed as it the progression of the relationship is a bit forced. Nonetheless, it's a funny show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6 - This is a fairly mediocre show, with controversy and its polarizing topic bringing it to the spotlight. It revolutionized the \"little sister\" genre of anime. Bringing incest in as a focal point of the show, which was actually unusual for its time. People shouldn't really watch this show because of the romance. The relationship progression is quite forced and unnatural, which can disappoint people. The great points of this show are the character interactions, which are really funny. This is mostly a comedy with some weird things happening once in awhile. If you have an open-mind and can stand incest, this is a fine watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

When I first saw it on Sword Art Online, I was completely confused and wondered why such a story archetype even existed! Yet, OreImo, isn't about incestuous love. It's really about two siblings bonding together over their problems and worries. \r\nI'll save the plot line and generic review comments, and tell you this: this anime was enjoyable to watch. It has a lighthearted tone throughout the anime and its comedy sure made me crack up every episode. The art is standard and doesn't poseany problems, and the story itself it interesting. The character interactions between Kirino and Kyousuke really drives the story forward with otaku-esque themes being the facilitator. There are a lot of \"easter egg\" like comedy in the anime, mainly through comedic allusions of existing anime (sort of like Lucky Star's Haruhi Suzumiya references, although the references in OreImo are not as obvious); thus, if you watch Oreimo after watching a lot of other anime, you'll enjoy the series even more. \\n\\n\r\nYet, this anime is not without its problems. Kyousuke's constant \"save the day\" moments with Kirino's problems become slowly annoying over time because Kirino acts so pretentious and rude despite her brother's acts of kindness. I question Kyousuke, \"Why do you help your sister so much despite her terrible treatment of you?\" Kyousuke continually helps his sister through her troubles because in the end, they are blood siblings who love each other for who they truly are. \\n",

            "content": "Ore no imouto ga konna Ni kawaii wake ga nai is a romantic comedy (Or Oreimo) exceeding in various situations. Oreimo\u2019s plot heavily relies from its characters.\r\nStory: The Story is quite simply early on but evolves into a well written unexpected trip. You will never be sure what is next to come\r\nCharacters: Oremio\u2019s characters are fleshed out, most are incredibly well written and generally lovable.\r\nKyousuke is a generally nice soul helping many around him. He tries to be a supportive brother to Kirino he often bites off more than he can chew to help others. He also becomes somewhat of a heart-throb later in theseries.\\n\\n\r\nKirino is a complete foil to Kyousuke. She\u2019s cold, abusive, and aggressive. She is very interested in Big Brother X Little sister eroge but brushes it to the side claiming only to play it for the Little sisters. As the series goes on she warms up to her brother but when Kyousuke with other women, Kirino often makes it her goal to sabotage. She is surprisingly the best written character in the show. Bitchiness aside, the writers wanted to make her get under your skin, they wanted her to annoy you, and the reveal of why she is that way at the end is very well done.\\n\\n\r\nManami Tamura is a childhood friend of Kyousuke and also has a large crush on him.  Kyousuke and her are swell friends and hang out many times within the show. She is very shy, quiet, and sweet. Manami however is not a well written character, whereas Kirino is intentionally annoying, Manami is just unlikable in some instances. However the ending episodes writing of Manami makes up for all of that resulting in a very surprising way.\\n\\n\r\nRuri Goko is a \u201cfriend\u201d of Kirino, although they constantly get in verbal scuffles. However, both girls genuinely care for each other and value the time they spend together. She wears very gothic clothes even when it is extremely hot.\\n\\n\r\nSaori Makishima is yet another friend of Kirino, helping her become friends with Ruri. She dresses as a stereotypical otaku, but has the body of a supermodel. Despite her general appearance in public, Saori is actually from a wealthy family, and speaks with a formal voice outside of meeting with her friends. She is one of the not very well written characters having little screen time and almost none character development.\\n\\n\r\nMany, MANY characters come in at a later point in time but this is the usual cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe Voice acting is done very well, capturing the shyness or hostility in one\u2019s voice. The background music is surprisingly catchy and changes all the time.\\n\r\nThe art is above standard and a treat to look at and everything in the show has a high attention to detail.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a very odd show, breaking away from the clich\u00e9s of romantic anime and inserting every type of humor. Kirino may bug you but the end of the show is very well done, also revealing a behind curtains antagonist that has been doing things to achieve their way since the beginning. Overall, It\u2019s fun to watch and is defiantly a must watch.\\n",

            "content": "So, disclaimer: I could only endure 12 episodes of this show before dropping it like Organic Chemistry.  Thus, my review is limited to Season 1 (though I\u2019ve heard rumors of Season 2's uncomfortable, unsatisfying conclusion, making me glad I spared myself from another 12+ episodes of barely repressed rage).  \r\nI don\u2019t really remember how I came across Oreimo.  I think I saw a clip of it on YouTube, thought it looked interesting, and decided to check it out.  Boy, was that a mistake.  There aren\u2019t many shows I hate, but I genuinely despise Oreimo.  I could spend many, manyparagraphs breaking down why I hate it so much, but the primary reason is that the main female character, Kirino, is horrible.  I don\u2019t mean that she\u2019s badly written; rather, that she\u2019s a terrible person, one of the most unlikeable characters I\u2019ve ever come across in a fictional work.  \\n\\n\r\nI stopped watching the show after Season 1, so her backstory\u2014namely, her upbringing with her brother, Kyosuke\u2014is still largely a mystery to me.  However, regardless of what happened in her past, no matter how tragic or traumatic it might have been, the obscene level of physical and verbal abuse she heaps on Kyosuke throughout Season 1 is completely unjustifiable.  Her kicks, punches, and headbutts aren\u2019t mere slapstick played for laughs (for an example of effective physical comedy in an anime, check out Baka and Test).  To the contrary, it is full-blown domestic violence, leaving lasting bruises and scars all over Kyosuke\u2019s body.  Maybe it\u2019s just me, but I don\u2019t find domestic violence \u201ccute\u201d in the slightest.  \\n\\n\r\nKirino\u2019s actions are made even more intolerable by the fact that throughout Season 1 Kyosuke is trying his best to help Kirino at every turn, putting his time, money, and reputation on the line to rebuild their relationship.  And how does Kirino greet his efforts?  With indifference and cruelty, of course!  Kirino\u2014along with her two Mean Girls-esque middle-school friends\u2014made Oreimo so unpleasant for me to watch that I eventually gave up on the show entirely and started watching Spice and Wolf instead (a much, MUCH better show, btw).\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with Kirino is that she\u2019s positioned as the protagonist of the series; the audience is supposed to like her, relate with her, and root for her to succeed.  However, her abusive and selfish behavior, combined with her being a Mary Sue otaku with a brother complex, leaves me hating her more than most villains I\u2019ve come across in anime.  At the very least, it would have been nice to see her suffer some consequence for her brutish actions that leads to introspection and growth (and no, her half-hearted attempt at a thank-you party in episode 11 doesn\u2019t count, especially since episode 12 contains her biggest beatdown of Kyosuke in the series up to that point).\\n\\n\r\nHowever, as much as I hate this show\u2014and I truly, truly hate it\u2014I can\u2019t in good conscience give Oreimo a 1/10.  To deserve a 1/10, a show must lack any artistic merit whatsoever; basically, that the creators shouldn\u2019t have bothered to make the show in the first place, and the world might actually be better off if they had made such a decision.  It is the ultimate condemnation, to say that \u201cnot existing\u201d is preferable to \u201cexisting.\u201d  And I can\u2019t in good faith argue that Oreimo is so vile or worthless that it doesn\u2019t deserve to exist.  For whatever inexplicable reason, Oreimo has a head-scratchingly high number of fans (a fact that continues to baffle me to this day).  Not to say I wouldn\u2019t give 1/10 to a show because of its popularity; rather, I honestly believe Oreimo has some artistic value.  \\n\\n\r\nThere are elements of the show I like, particularly Kyosuke\u2019s \u201cgirlfriend\u201d and her family (honestly, the show would\u2019ve been so much better if it had centered on them instead).  Unfortunately, these positive elements are completely overshadowed by Kirino, in all her ingloriousness.  Still, Oreimo has been a surprising source of inspiration and introspection for me; my disdain of the show has helped hone my analytic prowess, leading to greater self-awareness as to why I like what I like and why I dislike what I dislike.  To appreciate the good, you need to experience and learn from the bad. And what have I learned from Oreimo?  That I hate watching jerks be mean to each other for 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend the show?  Well, I gave it a 3/10, so that should tell you something.  Unless any of what I\u2019ve just described intrigues you, avoid this show at all costs.",

            "content": "-Project Zakuro Reviews: OreImo-\r\nOre no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai (or OreImo for short) is a rather intriguing slice-of-life anime released to date. Rather than tackle the generic tropes of the slice-of-life genre, it instead tackles the inside story of otaku culture in hopes of promoting otaku acceptance in Japan, if not, worldwide. So does this anime help to enforce the theme it is trying to convey? Well then, let's find out.\r\nThe story is mainly about Kyousuke: an average high school student, and his sister Kirino: a middle school model, who basically live their lives with little regard for one another. That isuntil Kyousuke discovers an anime left behind in the house and after some investigation, finds out that the owner of the anime is none other than his sister Kirino. The discovery prompted Kirino to enact \"life counseling\" and brings Kyousuke to her room to show him her stache of anime collections hidden in her closet, revealing to her brother that Kirino loves anime as well as eroge PC games. However seeing that otaku are frowned upon society, Kyousuke agrees to help keep her hobby a secret and in the process gets involved in Kirino's otaku-related errands throughout the rest of the anime. The story in terms is very basic and seems to develop ways of engaging the viewers in unexpected ways. Although nothing impressive like you would find in other genres, the story is well built and actually helps to convey the reality of otaku culture rather than stereotype it frequently to the point of humor. There's enough good content within the story to keep the viewers entertained from the beginning to the end.\\n\\n\r\nI'll be bluntly honest here. The art designs of the characters didn't really appeal to me that much. Not that Hiro Kanzaki is a bad artist, in fact far from it. I actually find him a decent artist but it's just that the art style of the anime is nothing too impressive either. The art style (despite being moe in nature) seems to rely heavily on being as reality-based as it could get. Because of this, any pizzazz like you would see in other genres is almost completely absent. Luckily though, OreImo doesn't rely on one style alone. I have seen various and eye-catchy character designs for the in-anime anime such as Stardust Witch Meruru. The wide variety of art styles found in this anime is enough to make up for the lack of impression of the main style. As for animation, pretty much basic and average but everything still runs smoothly to the frame rate. The in-anime shown in the background is actually a very impressive touch done by the animators so kudos to them. My issue with the animation though is that some scenes will show background characters with hardly any movements at all, failing to portray an actual public situation. It is a problem that I find common in almost every anime I watched so far. Despite this, the art and animation are decent but still good.\\n\\n\r\nThe music that plays in OreImo is again nothing too impressive. I'm starting to notice a pattern of just how realistic this anime is actually trying to be. As far as background music goes, the only excitement I felt from it was during the Meruru song but that's pretty much it. Overall the background music is basic but it does fit their scenarios quite well. The opening theme by ClariS is one of the best themes I heard so far and so I was really impressed by the effort put into it. And the wide variety of ending themes is a brilliant idea to break away from the usual tropes of them having to be replayed after every episode so it's nice to see a change. The ending themes are very well done. The voice acting is also superb and each actor portrays their character personalities very well. So far, no mess ups for this category but I haven't watched the dubbed version yet so there's little I can say for the voice acting at this point.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters. With all do respect, the majority of characters are likable but there are some instances where these characters can sometimes become annoying. I'm specifically talking about Kirino. I understand that she's supposed to be the centerpiece of otaku acceptance but some times, she shows her \"annoying Imouto\" trait and that's when I can't stand her sometimes. Especially when confronting her brother about eroge. Even Kyousuke himself shows a display of annoyance whenever he overreacts about something related to eroge. So far I have mixed feelings of the main protagonists but the rest of the characters are good and likable. My personal favorite is Kuroneko for her nonchalant personality. With that said, the characters are likable only with a few exceptions but that doesn't stop this anime from having a good decent cast.\\n\\n\r\nOreImo may be basic but because it is trying to convey otaku culture into slice-of-life, the entertainment factor is enough to keep any viewer enjoyed all the way to the end. With its fair share of comedy, drama, and entertaining flow, this anime has done a good job trying to convey the main message it was trying to bring out. If you're an anime fan and you're proud of it, I recommend you give this a try.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Evaluation: Worth the watch.",

But i gave it a chance since it seemed pretty popular. \r\nThe story of a little sister and an older brother, the imouto is the typical high grades kawaii athletic and popular model chan and the bro being a looser who will never get a girlfriend. Bro discovering her hidden passion for Eroge (japanese dating games made for the interest of males). She decides to console her love for her hobby to him - no one must findout about cause it could turn her into an out cast and ruin her image. Forcing him to go to anime conventions and such with her. Ill admit the last few episodes and the OVA's are highly fan service based and involve hinting that their relationship took a turn towards incest love. But overall the anime was enjoyable. It should be more enjoyable if your an Otaku lol. They include all the typical maid cafe, anime cons and such.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend it so long as you dont mind the hinting of incest throughout the series. Also they DO NOT actually have any incest at any point. Basicaly laugh at the comical fun and dont watch it with your brother or sister. :)\\n\r\nThank You. Yume Tang",

This is a review for all the seasons and specials of Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake Ga Nai\r\nSome similar anime I have seen with scores:  Toradora!(10)  Nana(10)  Lovely Complex(8)  Baka and Test(10)   Seto no Hanayome(6) not a style of comedy I like.\r\nStory:  8\t        The story progressed quite quickly. The main brother sister relationship with Kirino (sister) and Kyousuke (brother) grows and progresses through many incidents, and you feel them getting closer and closer, and that Kyousuke really tries to be a good brother. I really enjoyed theirrelationship and felt it was endearing. There are also a few twists and turns that keep the story fresh and interesting. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  9\tThe main protagonists (Kirino and Kyousuke), and Kuroneko get developed quite well, and they feel interesting and understandable. Kuroneko's character I fell in love with, she is such a great character, and so adorable for the first time I understand moe, a pure innocent little sister you want to care for and protect. She is now one of my top 5 favorite characters in anime (I've watched 100's). As for Ayase and Kanako they needed to be developed more for their actions to make more sense. Also a little additional background to Kyousuke would have helped make him more multi-dimensional, and Kirino is a little over the top with her tsun side (hitting, angry, and denying) making her character less believable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  9\tThis anime was a joy to watch. Most of the episodes had at least a few jokes in there that made me laugh quite a bit. The jokes are great and well thought out, and are not slapstick. This is one of the funniest anime I have seen in a long time. There is also great fun poking at, commenting on anime, and the examining of Otaku culture. Also I remember feeling the tension once or twice thinking \"no way.\" The comedy combined with developed characters and interesting relationships made it addicting to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  8\t         It would be nice to read some of the light novel first to get a little extra background for Kyousuke and for Ayase and Kanako, and see a softer Kirino not so tsun (hitting, angry, and denying), as in the light novels. Those and the ending are the main negatives to the anime. Overall the plot, characters, comedy, and relationships were great. I think I would maybe even re-watch some episodes for the laughs and Kuroneko, and I almost never re-watch anything.\\n\\n\r\nEnding:  6\t          The ending is okay till the last 3 minutes of the ending, which outraged pretty much everyone, including myself. There is a reason, the publisher wouldn't let the author write the ending he wanted, which is in the link. Many say the real ending is in the Tsuzuku PSP game, look on YouTube and look for dizzy ziddy's play through. If you watch the play through of the last chapter(s) and read the interview, you should come away feeling okay about the ending, but not thrilled either.\\n\\n\r\nInterview with the author about the ending restrictions and what he tried to convey.

            "content": "A solid anime that holds its own ground on the bases it provides in the general description given.\r\nStory 8/10: The story is solid and leaves some of it to the viewers imagination, especially the official \"Season 2 Ending\", and not the OVAs. The OVA's that are frequently tacked onto this season are often found labled as \"Episodes 14, 15, and 16\", but they are just not. The season ended solidly on its own, but it didn't include the One-dimensional ending that the Light Novel had. So they decided to tack the novel ending on with these OVAs. The original Author wanted a Full-Incest relationship betweenKirino and Kyousuke, but the publishers made him tone it down because the fear of societal backlash hence they don't specifically do anything in the series. \\n\\n\r\nYou can thoroughly enjoy the Series up until these OVAs and leave happy and satisfied.  \\n\\n\r\nOnce you start the OVAs, you will \"leave the theatre\" so to speak, wanting your money back like a large portion of the internet who has universally called them \"One of the worst endings in anime history\". Long story short, he tells all of the girls except the one he likes that like him that he is not interested. Their reactions vary from mouth-foaming rage to utter acceptance as they already saw it coming and only through their emotions in there to see what would happen. The girl he likes is at first emotionally reluctant, but ultimately realizes her true feelings agrees to be with him. \\n\\n\r\nThen within an hour later \"In-Anime-Time\" they apparently decide that they should already give up on their relationship because it's simply not \"accepted\" in their society, throwing away all their feelings towards another, but stay together for a short time(1/2 year) so they can forge good memories. They admit they enjoyed it greatly and did not regret it, but that is why they must end it. \\n\\n\r\nThe OVAs are such a bad ending because the main character Kyousuke is left with nothing but his Otaku-Eroge-Sister-complex sister, Kirino. Then it suddenly ends with him gaining absolutely nothing over the Original Ending of the anime, and leaving him with virtually nothing other than his sister and a loose set of now-poor friendships that could falter at a firm breeze because of the previously mentioned \"Telling everyone but his love interest that he's not interested\" moments.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: Both are at acceptable levels, unlike Higurashi which decided that their funding should go towards cocaine and cocaine accessories.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10: Character development was strong and well done for a series with only 11 and 13 episodes in their season not counting OVAs. The OVA's if anything reversed development and decided to make things worse than before they started for unapparent reasons.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10: It was thoroughly enjoying watching the second season right up until the end as it tried to explore different options and feelings between the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThat is, up until the OVAs that do-away with virtually all the characters but the main character and his love interest of which he notifies all the other possible interests he is not interested beforehand. Which means he thoroughly burned all his bridges before moving forward, leaving no room for error. And guess what, there's an error. They may be repairable bridges though, but nowhere near as sturdy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Enjoyment 8/10: The series up until the end of the second season is thoroughly satisfying to watch. I stayed up for 16+ hours running a marathon of it and was unanimously happy that I decided to watch it. Then I saw the OVAs latched on to season 2 to serve as a more \"concise\" ending rather than leaving the viewer in their happy bliss. Needless to say as mentioned above, I literally couldn't sleep after staying up all night to watch the entire series including the OVAs. They were that bad it left me sleeplessly wondering \"Why did they go and ruin this amazing ending with this sheer level of poor writing that needlessly went further than it should have\".",

            "content": "Ore no Imouta ga konnani Kawii Wake ga Nai, or Oreimo is basically about a normal guy who want's to live as normally as possible finds out that his little sister is actually a in the closet otaku. Now, I know this sounds like a really generic anime, (it kinda is, but also isn't) but this show actually goes into various ways otaku-ism (I think?) can effect relationships, and people's lives. Something most anime with otaku protaginists totally ignore. \r\nNow to go further into the actual plot it's basically Kyousuke (protaginist) figuring out how to help a bunch of middle school girls. Suprisingly it's interestingsince they bring up a lot of good points are how otakus are looked down upon. I can actually relate to most of them since my family always call me otaku, and weaboo.\\n\\n\r\nThis show itself it one big, ball of irony also. Since Kyousuke's phylospy is that living a normal life is best, and gets stuck with a bunch of otaku (They are considered bad in Japan.) He states that people who are siscons are crazy, and only like them since they don't have little sisters while the title is translated as \"My Little Sister Can't be This Cute.\" They also mention that watching anime will make you like incest, or become a sex offender. Kirino (the little sister) makes Kyousuke play eroge and watch anime, and again refer to the title.\\n\\n\r\nNow the art really kinda sucked. Now I know every illustator has their own art style, but it didn't really stand out all that mention. The only thing that really stood out was the backgrounds. They had a lot of detail like at the whole comicon thingy it had cosplayers, and a bunch of people. This is probably the only thing that was really good since it's school life, and doesn't have like any service shots.\\n\\n\r\nSound was all right. I couldn't find many translations for the actual opening, or ending but from the little I could actually translate, and what I did find they were pretty catchy, but they didn't really fit the show. Since the first one was basically about Kirino just being tsundere. \\n\r\nBGM was nice too. Each character's theme was original, and didn't sound like a ripe off from another cheap anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow character's is a major issue for me. Mainly Kirino she is a total b***** like seriously. She goes and treats Kyousuke like he was some kind of infectious disease for years, and then when he finds out her secret and realizes she can use him she becomes a total slave driver! Yeah, she's tsundere, but she's has like no dere! All I saw was just her picking on her brother, she wasn't even that cute about it, or anything. Also everything she does she's good at. She the star of the track team, great grades, a model, popular, writes a novel that instantly gets serialized. She's another Shiina that's how much talent she has! Character's like that really annoy me! And she's the main chick too! (I'm going by the title of the show.) Ugh, when I see her I kinda want to break something! She's not even strong idependent women, she's just a major b*****. Now this are words I don't throw around a lot but their is no other way to describe her.\\n\\n\r\nKyousuke is an interesting character as well. He was the main reason I continued to watch this show (I originally watched it since it had tsundere, but after I saw her I was like \"Hell no!\") He beliefs that normal life is the best. He want's to get a plain job, a plain wife, and live as plainly as possible. The whole house, wife, two kids, and a dog plan. It makes you wonder why does he think this? When I was a kid I always wanted to be a hero of some kind. I never wanted to live a plain life so why did he? Like what Keima always say \"Reality is s***\" so why did he want to submit to reality? And why did he always work so hard for everyone elses sake? He never really got anything out of it so why do it? And I don't want to hear the whole \"well he's the protaginist.\" If he wants a normal life why do this stuff? He's basically the most interesting person in the show, and one of the few reason I actually watched it.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also Kuroneko, and Ayase who are both Kirino's best friends, and total oppisites. Kuroneko is tsundere done right along with chuunbiyou (kinda) otaku, while Ayase is a yandere, model. This developed a very interesting dinamic between the group since Kirino wants to be able to talk about how she enjoys anime, and stuff while Ayase has a prejudice. (Otaku are often mentioned when people talk about sex offender, and various other crimes. People also mention that otaku-ism leads to crime so I don't think it's alright to hate her for that.)\\n\\n\r\n[Spoilers] Kinda? You've been warned.\\n\r\nNow before anything else I suggest you have alteast some knowledge of the ending.\\n\r\n[Actual Spoiler]\\n\r\nThe ending is something that's really awful since I was rooting for Ayase, or Kuroneko the show and the show went and pulled the incest card. Now I don't hate incest (Some of my favorite manga have implied incest, and have cousin marrieds. Now i know that's not siblings but still) but it kinda half baked it since it was only a temporary relationship. Personally I think if your gonna do go all out. Like I can't see me commiting incest then dating someone else. It would really awkward to mention, and if it was a harem I wouldn't be suprised if it destroyed all the other girls affection for me. So when they did that it was kinda like what the hell. Of course I also was rooting for Kuroneko, and Ayase and really hated Kirino.\\n\\n\r\nNow this show is probably for Otaku's, School Life lovers, Rom-com lovers, Incest lovers, harem lovers, and Protaginist lovers (that's me. I think Kyousukes a good one since he manages to be intersting like Kyon, and Hachiman while also helping everyone.) Or maybe if you just want to see a bunch of innocent girls suffer.",

            "content": "Very cute with lots and lots of drama!  This series completely snuck up on me and grabbed my heartstrings.  \r\nThe story is about the icy relationship between 17 year old brother Kyosuke and his younger sister, 15 year old Kirino.  In the beginning, Kyosuke helps her to find a club to talk about her interests in the hopes of helping her develop healthy friendships.\r\nThe story line is surprising in that you think that Kirino is going to be a polite and appreciative little sister, but instead she's pretty short tempered and kind of abusive to her brother. We can't quite understand whatmakes her tick -- she is totally immersed in anime that revolves around \"little-sister\" eroge, yet her own relationship with her brother is very conflicted. She tests her brother, asking him for one outrageous favor after another, and struggles to show any gratitude at all. The plot becomes more complex and you are rewarded with a lot of humorous drama which leads to a surprising, if not completely satisfying end. \\n\\n\r\nI first wrote a review after watching the first season, and gave it 9/10. But after watching the second season, I completely fell in love with the show and now offer my rarely given 10/10 rating with no regrets.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, I want to say that the animation itself was top notch, and all the characters were very well done. The voice acting was very emotive and the subtitles seemed well matched to the dialog. The girls were unbelievably cute, I can't think of another anime that had such deliciously adorable characters.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the music in the shows was great, a different closing theme song for each episode!  The theme song Irony by the duo ClariS is so beautiful and touching, it is just perfect for the story.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Otaku culture can be strange indeed, though of course, as is the case with everything, the extremists give otaku\u2019s a bad name. Take for instance Kirino Kousaka, a middle school girl who is obsessed with erotic video gaming and a little girl anime that Ore no Imouto even admits is something guys seem to love for all the wrong reasons. Then again, that\u2019s probably some sort of complex paradox because I\u2019m sure some people who watch this classic tale of a brother and sister in trouble who build their relationship through their trials and tribulations aren\u2019t paying attention to the story. They are more sopaying attention to the slutty girls who are being photographed by creepy men with pedo-staches. Either that or Kuroneko who is perhaps the greatest thing since pastrami on rye.\\n\\n\r\nOre no Imouto replicates real life in some strange ways that I wish weren\u2019t real, but the internet has shown otherwise. Kirino has a million erotic games hidden in her closet with a bunch of statues of Meruru, some generic magical girl.\\n\\n\r\nKirino\u2019s brother, Kyousuke Kousaka, finds out about her dirty hobby and decides he will help her hide it from her parents, who will probably disown her for owning explicit games. How does she get all this stuff? Well, she has a job as a model with her friends, a little feisty girl and a big feisty girl who aren\u2019t important enough to care about. What really makes this weird is that Kirino has an obsession with little sister games. This makes for a lot of awkwardness between Kirino and Kyousuke that could be misconstrued as some sort of romance developing, which we all know is quite possible but we don\u2019t want to happen. At least, I hope you\u2019re not all for this brocon siscon stuff. It\u2019s weird.\\n\\n\r\nThrough Kyousuke\u2019s help, Kirino meets some new friends, one of whom is Kuroneko, and together they do otaku stuff. Since Kirino has been hiding her fandom for so long, it gives her an outlet with which to show her love. And that\u2019s pretty much the whole plot. With the exception of a later section dedicated to Kirino writing a light novel, there\u2019s not a ton of plot or anything too memorable. But it is an entertaining plot nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty standard. It looks decent, but is nothing jaw dropping. Characters blush a lot and I don\u2019t understand why Kirino\u2019s hair is brown as a kid but orange-y as a teen. I mean, she could have dyed it or it could be the light, but it just struck me as odd.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is\u2026meh. The voices are good. But otherwise, the opening is very basic and dull. Upbeat pop song? Sounds like a plan! I must commend the series for having a lot of ending themes. Now, this isn\u2019t exactly a good thing. You can take twenty poops on the side of the road and they\u2019ll all stink. And that\u2019s kind of the same for the ending themes here. Quantity does not equal quality. Music during the show is generic piano compositions that are about six keys being played in some sort of order that sounds somewhat like dramatic music. You know why Mozart didn\u2019t do music for anime? Because he had talent. And anime hadn\u2019t been invented yet, but that\u2019s beside the point.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s there to say about the characters? A LOT! Kirino is a freaking fantastic little sister and I wish my little sister were like her! Instead I have to deal with my little sister complaining because Clannad is too mushy and Vampire Knight is the greatest anime ever made because it is like Twilight and Twilight is the greatest book ever written! Why can\u2019t all girls be like Kirino? A model, a pervert, and an otaku? One of the funniest scenes is when she gets her body pillow of Meruru and starts rolling all over it. IT\u2019S FUNNY BECAUSE SHE\u2019S JUST LIKE US! SHE\u2019S AN OTAKU! SHE LIKES BODY PILLOWS! HAHAHAHA! EXCEPT SHE\u2019S CUTE AND ADORABLE AND POPULAR AND WE AREN\u2019T!\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWho\u2019s this we and us?\u201d You ask from atop the highest apartment in the neighborhood, preparing to throw a tomato at me as if I were Dane Cook doing a comedy routine.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cSHUT UP!\u201d I cry in an attempt at a retort that goes horribly south as your tomato sticks to my shirt. \u201cI WANT TO FEEL INCLUDED!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nNow back to this. Kyousuke is a pretty solid character. He\u2019s fairly generic, \u201cI want to help people\u201d and \u201cGo with the flow\u201d and \u201cTAKE A FREAKING KICK TO THE BALLS FROM YOUR SISTER AND DON\u2019T GIVE THAT BITCH A BACKHAND!\u201d. His niceness is actually pretty funny. At one point he gets punched in the face by his dad, some sort of cop who doesn\u2019t approve of anime or erotic games. All Kyousuke does is protect his sister and what she loves and you kind of grow to like him for being so selfless, even when he doesn\u2019t get much in return. Plus, his conversion into a erogamer is pretty funny.\\n\\n\r\nAnother character of note is Kuroneko, who I bring up a lot because she\u2019s just too damn adorable. She\u2019s hilariously dark; the complete opposite of Kirino (which is, of course, a means for comedy gold occasionally) and I personally found her to be the best character. She cares about Kirino while simultaneously hating her guts, she\u2019s a closet otaku who makes her own cosplays, and she\u2019s also a sweet girl outside of being an otaku and pretty shy. While I loved Kirino and Kyousuke\u2019s characters, I loved hers more.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, the characters aren\u2019t that impressive. Kyousuke has this girl who likes him and is a childhood friend, but she\u2019s flatter than Minami\u2019s chest (Baka and Test reference!)(My English teacher always told me that comparing media was the highest level of thinking). Her grandpa, on the other hand, is the greatest grandpa ever. He just wants his granddaughter and Kyousuke to bang. And he hides under the table like all good grandpas and tells them to do it. If he had his own anime, I\u2019d watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOre no Imouto, in all seriousness, is not a bad anime. It\u2019s a look at Japanese otaku culture (which is so impressive, I wish I could go to Japan through a portal and buy all that anime stuff) and also a decent character building adventure. The brother and sister thing does become kind of creepy at points, but a lot of the time it is pretty heartwarming and cheerful. You root on the characters and you grow to like them, not only for their subtle love for each other or because you can make parallels between themselves and you, but because you really want to see them do what\u2019s best for themselves. They\u2019re not totally realistic and barely take a life of their own, but the characters are still fun to be around. They\u2019re like friends you want to hang out with all the time.",

This is a story about coming to terms with what you like and finding the inner strength to be who you are regardless of what other people think. Concerning the characters I'd say that my favourite was definitely Kuroneko, her calm and intellectual personality was a nice contrast to Kirino's ridiculously feisty and bossy one.\r\nFor me this series would've been better if there had been more character development, I felt like even though Shiori is a prominentcharacter in the series very little is known about her. Moreover, it seemed as if Kirino just enjoyed being an arrogant brat all the time, which at times was just way too much considering how the whole anime is about her asking her brother to go out of his way on her account whenever she felt like it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Now I know I'm going against the grain here compared to all the other reviews and it's true at first i was a little skeptical about this anime as its not really my style but that soon changed about halfway through the first episode. I admit that some people might find it weird or just plain disgusting but I urge you to renounce all prejudices you may have against the seinen genre, so you are able to enjoy this anime to its full extent. \r\nThe Story is probably this anime's weakest point, but that is by no means saying it is bad. This anime, Iam glad to say is one which is actually believable, there is no sign of ridiculous superpowers or impossible things happening for no damn reason. its just an interesting, relate-able and hilarious story. \\n\r\nStory:8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is great, and I am usually a super tough critic when it comes to art in anime and manga.

I would have to say that this is the anime that has made me feel every single emotion and love every second of it, and that is owing solely to the characters and their reactions to the situations they find themselves in. \\n\r\nCharacters:10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime makes me so happy. I can honestly say that I spent most of it with hugely unattractive grin plastered across my face. This anime is hilarious, one of the funniest I've seen and I class among one of the top 5 anime's I have ever watched.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is outstanding. I would recommend it to everyone so long as they are willing to get past all the seinen and ecchi stuff and give it a chance.

There is nothing wrong about this, but you sometimes have to question his motives and why he is doing this for his sister. Also sometimes he is just always a downer and is never positive witch gets anoying because he's constantly bitching.\r\nthe other character that i have wrong is Kirino who is a little bitch and never gives thanksto his brother and always thinks down on him. She also gets anoying sometimes because she is such a horrible character.\\n\\n\r\noverall i give this anime a 6/10 because it is a little above average and would be better if the characters weren't bad.",

If you are looking for an anime built on degeneracy for degenerates with an incomplete sense of family dynamics and little social skills, you have found it.\r\nWhile the foremost quality of this anime is cuteness, as expressed in the title, Oreimo explores other topics as well, such as the stigma on otaku culture, making friends through common interests and incest.\r\nOverall I give it a 7 out of 10. I find it enjoyable because this is the quintessential example of the kind of entertainment that shouldn'thave been green-lighted for production, but was anyway, because there are enough adults in the world with little enough social skills to fill in the blanks of the degeneracy clearly present here.",

            "content": "When Oreimo aired, it became incredibly popular. I heard about it, and decided to give it a go. And man did I not regret it... first.\r\nOreimo has 2 seasons, and if season 1 did everything right, season 2 was a huge mess that destroyed everything the series had built.\r\nSTORY\r\nThis story is about a brother and a sister who can't stand each other. They're in a cold war, literally, as they don't talk with each other at all. The big brother is an average guy, who doesn't aspire to anything big. The little sister, on the other hand, is perfect in everything : perfect in school,perfect in sport, perfect in job, ...\\n\r\nEverything changes when the big brother discovers his perfect little sister's secret : she loves erogames, particularly those that include brothers and sisters. Since he discovered this secret, the little sister decides to let her brother in. From then, they become closer and closer.\\n\r\nThis pitch is absolutely great. It's sweet, it's deep (this story is about tolerance, it's a critic of the societal pressure and etiquettes), and it's funny as the situation is embarrassing and quite absurd sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the story has one major problem : they change a perfect brother-sister relationship into a boring love relationship. Yes, love : those two brother and sister fall in love, literally.\\n\r\nNow, I'm not against forbidden love, I couldn't care less about something like that. What I don't like about this is :\\n\r\n- it makes this anime a love story, which is incredibly boring because there's a ton of them. I like originality, and a story about a brother and sister is much more rare than a love story.\\n\r\n- that brotherhood was pure gold! As a big brother myself, I respected the MC a lot, because of the way he protects and helps his little sister. But in season 2 (well, in the end of season 1, to be honest), that guy loses any interest. Instead of being a big bro, he becomes a cheesy boy in love.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nFrom this side, nothing to say. The design is clean, in the good average of what could be done back then. Note that they change the opening in each episode (like they wanted to say \"hey, you see, this is not impossible!\").\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nSongs were made by ClariS. So they can give you a good mood.\\n\r\nAs for the OST, I don't remember at all. It was nothing outstanding, but nothing bad either.\\n\r\nAs for the voice actors, they're the best. Everyone knows Kirino and her brother's voice actors, so there's no need to introduce them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nAs I said earlier, I love the relationship between Kirino and Kyousuke, in season 1. I also love each of those characters apart. Sure, Kirino as a real person would be really annoying. Let's be honest, she's a b*tch. But as a character from a comedy show, she's really cool. I like her fights with Kuroneko.\\n\r\nKyousuke is a great big brother, ready to do anything for his beloved sister. That's in season 1. Then he becomes Kirino's loyal dog and deserves no respect whatsoever.\\n\r\nAs for the supporting cast, they're funny as well. My favourite has to be Kuroneko, Kirino's gothic friend ; or is it the yandere Ayase? I don't know, really. Each character has a unique personality, and most of them do bring something to the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nI loved season 1, hated season 2. The story and the characters were great in the beginning, then I don't know what happened, but all this became crap. The story turned into a basic love story, whereas the characters become absolute clich\u00e9s, and not just for comedy purpose.\\n\\n\r\nAs a conclusion, I really recommend the first season. Then, no need to go further, really. If you stop at episode 12 of season 1, the story doesn't feel incomplete.",

            "content": "Story [7/10]:\r\nThis anime had an odd story that felt like it didn't really go anywhere. The episodes felt like fractured mini stories rather than one continuous story line, nothing seems to really connect except in the long run. Every single episode has a weird time jump to it that can sometimes feel like you missed a detail or another from episode to episode.\r\nArt [7/10]:\r\nStandard art style as far as most anime goes, nothing truly stuck out in my mind as being truly exceptional. Although I found the style throughout cute and I thought that the intros and outros having differing details every time made theminteresting and kept me from skipping past them.\\n\\n\r\nSound [8/10]:\\n\r\nPretty good intro, pretty good outro. There are also songs within the anime such as the theme song for Meruru which has been stuck in my head for a few days and something I have sung quietly out loud to myself. The nice little tunes that establish an atmosphere are also positives that I liked about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [9/10]:\\n\r\nKirino is a cute character but also extremely annoying, however the growth of all the characters throughout the anime are interesting to see develop despite the fractured story. I think that the incestual undertone is kind of odd although that is kind of the whole point of the anime. Seeing the brother sister duo grow and have their relationship develop is really what this anime is about and without these two differing personalities the show wouldn't be as interesting as it is.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [9/10]:\\n\r\nAlthough starting this show very long ago on Crunchyroll and only watching the first three episodes I am glad that I came back to finish this anime. It wasn't as interesting or captivating as others I have watched but it was still extremely enjoyable and a fun watch that I am glad I came back to finish. I don't think this anime is for everyone nor do I think I will re-watch it but I will most likely watch all the ONAs and the second season.",

            "content": "-This Review Might Spoil A Bit-\r\nOreimo, or I Can't Believe My Little Sister Is This Cute, is an anime about Little Sister-Chan (Kirino Kousaka) and her brother, Likeable Character-San (Kyousake Kousaka), as he discovers that his little sister is an Otaku and likes Ecchi games about little sisters, and kinkshames her at the dinner table. The two then proceed to bond in many cute scenes that go by the theme of him helping her out with her life, and if you forget every single time Little Sister-Chan hits and abuses Likeable Character-San it can be a very fun show. Little Sister-Chan abusing Likeable Character-San getsso bad, that she beats him up and then headbutts him, leaving him bleeding for what seams like days(?). Like holy shit, how the hell does he get with his little sister in the end if she keeps doing THAT to him!\\n\r\nOreimo also has strong themes that the show likes to dip into like some kind of cheese dip made of actual good writing, and it can really make some strong emotional moments with these scenes that really help to make this series actually kinda fun... as long as you ignore all the cringe-y scenes where everybody thinks HIS FUCKING 14 YEAR OLD SISTER is his girlfriend. One of the most interesting episodes I thought was when Little Sister-Chan wrote a Light Novel and it was published, and Gothic Best Girl (Ruri Gokou) was jealous because she had worked for years to write amazing stories, but as soon as Little Sister-Chan writes something it becomes popular enough to get a fucking anime. Like at the end, we finally get to see more of Gothic Best Girl's homelife and really the biggest thing I want in this show is for Likeable Character-San just to marry one of the other girls and not his fucking sister. \\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, Little Sister-Chan is a fucking bitch. You may or may not agree, but holy shit, she beats her older brother, she whines and complains all the fucking time, she contently makes Likeable Character-San to do embarrassing shit, and she put his porn out on his bed and on his computer for Deredere Childhood Friend-Chan (Manami Tamura) to see out of pure spite. Really, I just wish we could have seen more of the other characters instead of Little Sister-Chan. Like I wanted to know more about Deredere Childhood Friend-Chan and Tsundere Loli Number 652 (Kanako Kurusu). Personally, I felt like the two's personalities and backstories needed to be more explored in this, and I'm hoping the cringe-y second season I heard was real makes this possible, and we don't just focus on Little Sister-Chan and instead get to know who Tsundere Loli Number 652. Who is she? Where did she come from? Who's her family, are they a piece of shit?\\n\r\nOne thing I did really enjoy about this anime was both the nice animation in some shots, Tsundere Loli Number 652 having the same voice actress as Pink Haired Magical Girl Number 19,345, and the fact the character development between Little Sister-Chan and Likeable Character-San was really fun in a lot of scenes when they weren't doing weird incest activities. Like I love seeing them talk about things Little Sister-Chan likes, and when Likeable Character-San is playing her Ecchi games, or the scene where Little Sister-Chan is playing the Tsundere route of a Little Sister game and is so happy when she finds Tsundere Loli Number 764's soft dere shell and starts rolling all over the ground. I would rather see Little Sister-Chan go along her everyday life loving Otaku shit with her big brother out there to protect her, then him falling on her tiddie and her going \"Oh no, Onii-Sama!! >////<\" or some shit like that.\\n\\n\r\nI think it's an eh show. Like it's got it's problems, and I think those problems kinda ruin it for me, you get me?",

Many people disliked this anime because they find it gross , disgusting and find it hard to watch because its about relationship between the sister and her brother . But from my perspective , this anime tells me the true meaning of \"love\" . True love can happens anywhere . It does not have to be childhood friend , schoolmate , classmate , teacher , whatever . It can even be your lovedones like your \"sister\" . True , it can be disturbing and people think it will not happen in real life . Once again , Who knows ? This anime is really really good because the voice actors , the song tracks bring all the feelings in certain scenes out in the anime . But after all , its still your choice whether you want to watch this anime . Like i say in the beginning , everyone have different tastes in anime . Just give it a try till episode 4 or 6 , if cannot take it , just drop it then :( (NOT RECOMMEND THOUGH) This anime is best watched during weekends to finish straight away ^^ Thanks me later after you finished this season and the 2nd season of OreImo :)\\n",

            "content": "OreImo was interesting as a show due to the fact that I initially began watching it thinking that it was going to be about a certain theme, and then ultimately ended up being about a whole different twist that sort of snuck up on me in season 2.  That said, this review is on the first season, so I will review it as its own quantity without taking the sequel into account.\r\nBefore getting into my thoughts on the story, let's discuss the technical aspects of the show.  \r\nThe artwork and animation is pleasant and well above par for these slice of life comedies.The characters are drawn very well and while the characters do suffer from a bit of similar face style and such, the anime is pleasant to look at and doesn't run into too many instances of bizarre animation.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sounds and voice acting are done pretty well also.  The voice actors do a good job establishing character personality and emotions come out well.  The music is also catchy and appropriate for what's going on, I had no real complaints.  \\n\\n\r\nWith regards to the story, I may go into some slight spoilers here but I'll try to avoid anything major.  As I'm reviewing the first season here, I can say that the story was a little bizarre to me at first, but I ultimately liked what I thought the author was trying to do.  Taken on its own, the major theme of the first season had a lot to do with fitting into society and making friends when you end up with a hobby that isn't socially acceptable.  As someone who in the past has gamed, table top board gamed, and takes an interest in fantasy and science fiction, while working in a non-nerdy field surrounded by people who do not really care for these things and look down on them, I could relate to the struggle of the main character and her hobby. \\n\\n\r\nGranted, the main character, Kirino in this case's, hobby has to do with something far more questionable than playing World of Warcraft on the weekends.  While Japanese otaku culture is somewhat different than American nerd culture (though there is obviously some overlap), Kirino's hobby is very socially unacceptable, and definitely raises interesting questions about what's going on in her head (much of which comes to be explained in season 2, which I have additional thoughts on, but this isn't the place).  \\n\\n\r\nThe series then progresses from Kirino's brother Kyousuke's unwitting discovery of his sister's hobby, and his \"life counseling\" sessions where he (*against his better judgment) tries to help his sister deal with the ramifications of her \"unacceptable\" otaku habits, from getting their conservative dad to accept her hobby, towards finding other otakus that she can share her hobby with and fit in.  \\n\\n\r\nOn its face, the struggle of dealing with two faces, where one has the \"public\" side and the \"private\" side is dealt with on this show.  On the one hand, Kirino has one life as a popular girl in school with many \"normal\" friends and hobbies.  On the other hand, she spends all her money on otaku merchandise that horrifies her best friend and family. and maintains a second circle of friends sharing these hobbies as well.  Season one deals with the balance of these double lives and the relationship with her friends and brother.\\n\\n\r\nKyousuke, Kirino's brother and the other main lead in the story, ends up going through quite a bit in order to help his sister, who he originally doesn't seem to care too much about.  He also learns a lot about this other world of otakus that he didn't have anything to do with, and actually interacts with Kirino's new friends as well, which adds a lot of comedic interactions.  Watching his development and attitude shifts is one of the high points of season one.\\n\\n\r\nThis is all well and good.  There is a subtext with her brother than needs to be addressed, but I will save that for a season two review.  For those that only watch season one, it won't come into play too much, but for those who ultimately watch the sequel, it's going to come into play.\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to discuss this series too much more without majorly spoiling everything so I will stop.  \\n\\n\r\nWith regards to the characters in the show, they are for the most part entertaining, but a little shallow.  There is definitely a bit of the harem problem that many of these slice of life shows like to dive into, which is unfortunate.  Many of the otherwise potentially interesting female characters end up rotating far too much around Kyousuke to develop strongly.  There should have been more male members to play off of to help this along, but as per usual, there don't tend to be any that play more than a bit role.\\n\\n\r\nThere is additional character development in season 2 for many of the characters, so it's not totally fair to write them off as shallow.  But anyone that only watches season one could definitely make the case that many of the characters only play to tropes and archetype.  Season one Kyousuke lacks a strong personality for the most part, and Kirino is a over the top example of a overly bitchy personality as well, which is a little unfortunate as these two are the main characters.  There are worse offenders out there in the shallow character department however.\\n\\n\r\nSo is the anime actually worth a watch?  Is it enjoyable?\\n\\n\r\nSeason one I would say is a competent show.  It didn't do a lot to wow me, but I found the theme of having to live a quiet life with your hobbies interesting even if I didn't specifically enjoy the hobby that they were trying to hide.  Had I stopped at the end of season one, I think I would have said this is a slightly better than average slice of life, comedy, relationship story.  Season two changed my opinion of the show quite a bit (not in a positive way) but as I've mentioned, taking season one on its own merits, it's probably worth a watch if you would like to watch an interesting twist on slice of life that explores otaku culture a bit.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ore no Imouto is unique, it really is. It is unique, but quite typical at the same time, which makes it somewhat unique, right? Well the story revolves around Kyousuke and his tsundere, all tsun (urban dictionary tsundere if you don't know it), and barely any dere younger sister, Kirino. Kyousuke has had a rough relationship with his sister for the longest, until he finds her little dirty secret of being an otaku. Now he has to give her life counselling, sounds somewhat normal, right? Well it really isn't, the sister is a major, major, major otaku (crazy about anime and games) and for someodd and illogical reason likes little sisters......\\n\\n\r\nStory (7):\\n\r\nThe summary will suffice and it's nice seeing how Kirino's obsession and hobby develops and the brother and sister relationship changes throughout the series, but be warned it's still an anime. So expect awkward moments and impossible situations to occur (bro-con, sis-con, etc.). The most interesting part of the plot is seeing how the main characters develop, especially Kirino, but I'm not going to spoil anything. \\n\\n\r\nArt (7):\\n\r\nVery nice, the animation is quite smooth and the characters don't look awkward or anything. They actually look quite nice and help depict the characters personalities quite well. An example would by Kyousuke himself, looking at him and you can easily get an easy-going and plain vibe from him. Another would be his own sister Kirino, look at her and you get the feeling that you're looking at a princess (take it however you like, this is not a compliment in my opinion).\\n\\n\r\nSound (8):\\n\r\nIt's actually quite nice, the OP is quite nice depending on your taste in music. It's typical and catchy J-pop kind of feel, I personally did not love it, but I admit it was catchy. The ED was changed every few episodes to highlight the main topic of the episode or arc, it was an interesting change of pace and everyone will have a favourite, as the EDs range from J-pop, soft, and J-rock. Voice acting is quite nice, it fits each character quite well as none of them feel out of place (VA of Kyousuke, voiced Tomoya from Clannad).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9):\\n\r\nCharacters are by far the best of the entire show, they're all so unique. Ranging from the easy-going and nice-guy Kyousuke to the eccentric and hilarious Saori. The conversations between all the characters are always quite hilarious, from sarcastic comments and immature banter, loving remarks, and kinds works between each other.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I didn't enjoy the serious as much as I have some others, but I saw high value in it. It's an enjoyable show, but it's filled with awkward, eccentric anime moments. Believe me the portrayal of otaku in this show can be taken as hilarious, insulting, or just plain embarrassing. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n",

The anime is about a little sister who is one of the popular girls in school while at home she's an anime fan(otaku) with an obsession with eroge. To my knowledge extent an eroge is like a dating sim game about tabuu relationships like brother x sister, and teacher x student.  Well back to the story the little sister needs to learn to deal with telling her family and friends about her hobby and making new friends with her samehobby. Also her big brother who she has a strained relationship starts to bond with her as he helps her deal with her troubles. This anime is funny at certain points and can be dramatic when it needs too. Personally i find the main character Kirino(the little sister) a brat. She is very mean to her brother even if he's being nice. I personally like the side characters more then Kirino and her brother. I know some people will like Kirino with her tsundere attitude, but i find it annoying (its not a cute tsundere because she can be very mean only to him and one of her new anime friends. The anime is short and didn't take too long to finish. I found the brother (forgot his name sorry) interacting with the side characters more interesting the Kirino interacting with anyone. If your a fan of a comedy this is for you. They have funny anime things and the opening song is amazing :D. I'm ok with the anime it's just one of my favorites .",

            "content": "This is an anime that has made a lot of waves and, I'm not going to lie, I had avoided it like the plague but I am glad that I finally picked it up.  \r\nSTORY:\r\nThere is very little to say here, the core premise of the story is the relationship between the main character and his sister (The Titular \"Imouto\"). Their gradual transition from pretty much hating each other to , still hating each other but in a cute way is the entirety of the story. The characters, setting and even the activities are just a vehicle for the Brother/Sister interactions. \r\nThat is allthere is to the story, however this is not an anime that relies on story for engagement and I will elaborate in the next point.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nThis is where both, the best part of the series and the worst part of the series comes into play. I am going to make a strange comparison but please bare with me I am going somewhere with this;\\n\r\nThere is an anime called Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) and it is one of the most clich\u00e9d, stock-character, stock-plot, stock-action anime I have ever seen. It rips off from other media wholesale (Ex: A survival tournament held by an inscrutable entity, engaged by slightly superpowered characters face off to the death until there can be only one  , in order to get a prize... sound familiar? it's highlander, though lots of media rips off highlander (COUGH Rozen Maiden COUGH)) and the action is very plodding, many of the action scenes are perfunctory at best (Ex: Wolf \"fight\" is a prime example of a lame action scene with almost zero suspense involved).\\n\\n\r\nAlmost all of the cast is completely forgettable given how terribly underdeveloped they are, they have poor interactions at the best of times and what little they have consistents of simple anime stereotypes (Hey, here's the jock character saying something Jock-esque, here's the Tsundere character saying something Tsundere ish, here is the older badass businessman pulling strings, etc.). The main character is unforgivably stupid and poorly written (Goes from a complete pansy to gunning down people in almost no time flat). But, the plot and almost all of the lacklusters characters were bolstered greatly by a single uniting thread; Gasai Yuno.\\n\\n\r\nGasai Yuno is the original 'Queen of Yandere' , her presence, her actions and her backstory (Mystery) form the only unique and engaging thread in the entire anime. She singlehandedly makes this anime go from pure trash to , pure trash thats entertaining. But is a single character enough to make it a good anime? in my opinion, no.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is where the parallel begins;\\n\r\nIn Oreimo; The main character Kyousuke is actually pretty well written (For the most part), the supporting cast is extremely well written as well, with surprisingly complex motivations and development... especially for this genre, making them both deep and  endearing (In my opinion). The setting is mundane but belies the reality of societal pressures and isolation of Japan, again, in my opinion it does this very well, showing the difficulty that the Japanese have when it comes to relating to each other. \\n\\n\r\nIf I had to grade only the main character and the supporting cast (Goth loli, crazy otaku girl, insecure model type, hilariously inappropriate grandparents, etc.) I would not hesitate to give this a 9 or maybe even a 10, but it has the REVERSE problem that Mirai Nikki had. One single character drags down the entire show... Kirino, the Imouto, is one of the worst characters, I have ever seen in any media. She absolutely anchors any scene she's in with her ultra tsun-tsun behavior and just completely intolerable, unjustified hostility.\\n\\n\r\nHer character is nearly a black hole of entertainment. Where a little bit (Or even a lot) of tsun tsun (Cold, aggressive, hostile behavior) for a tsundere character is acceptable, this character goes so far beyond tsun tsun that she's just completely unreasonable and for me, draws away from the rest of the excellent cast. She is not tsundere, she's just a psychotic teenage girl with a major princess complex.\\n\\n\r\nShe becomes violent very quickly and unjustifiably so. \\n\r\nShe treats her friends and family like trash\\n\r\nShe acts very entitled to everyone's attention and even worship.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part about this is, she gradually infects the other characters to tolerate and even worship her abuse. This is not endearing, this is not charming, this is disappointing because she actively sucks the \"good\" out of the rest of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nBut as I said, everything else, literally everything else worked wonderfully, in my opinion. One of my favorite episodes was an episode where the main character stays away from the Kirino Imouto and it was the best written, funniest and balanced episode, with touches of romance, slap-stick and situational comedy. It worked really well which is tremendously disappointing because it showed what could have been.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI know that I did not talk about the Art or the Sound, but that is because the female lead Kirino completely eclipses almost every other aspect of the show. Again, it is the reverse effect of Gasai Yuno; Gasai Yuno carried Mirai Nikki from bad to mediocre. Kousaka Kirino anchors Oreimo down from excellent to average at best. I can honestly say, I have never wanted to love an anime more than this one, but the cancer that is Kirino made it impossible for me to enjoy it on any level beyond \"I can tolerate this\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI find very little to recommend here;\\n\r\nIf you like romance, this is not for you.\\n\r\nIf you like ecchi, this is not for you, despite the subject matter (You'll know what I mean) there is actually very little real ecchi here. There are doses here and there but few and far between.\\n\r\nIf you like comedy... what can I tell you, I found the supporting cast funny but Kirino scenes overshadow the fantastic supporting cast. \\n\r\nThat is all.",

            "content": "I'll be honest; I enjoyed watching this anime. It certainly was outside my expectations. It was generally cute, humorous, and relate-able to some extent (myself being an older brother). However, the anime was obviously made for the demographic of people who play H-games, particularly little sister ones. Myself not being one of them, I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable whenever the topic came up in the anime, which was all the time. It was like \"I don't get off to this stuff, but I know somebody else out there does, and that freaks me out\". But I digress.\r\nThe art is good. I find it adorablewhen female characters are drawn with the single fang, and it looks great on Kirino. The other female characters were good eye candy as well. The main character is the standard harem male character, reminding me greatly of Okazaki Tomoya or Maebara Keiichi. The sound was good, with a great opening song and a different ending song every episode. Some BGM was excellent, being reminiscent of BGM from Suzumiya Haruhi. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were all quite good. Kirino, outside of her hobby, which I really doubt actually exists (a little sister who digs little sister hentai? You wish Japan) is quite like a little sister, much more than the standard little sisters in anime. Kuroneko, Ayame, and the rest are all good 'real' girls. Some characters take questionable actions during the course of the anime, but I haven't a need to complain as plenty of plot elements are questionable in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot was probably the weakest element of the anime. I for one, am not a fan of anime that focuses on the lives of people who are fans of anime. Stuff like Nogisaka Haruka no Himitsu bores me to death. This had something extra that was different though. It was more about just the brother/sister relationship. Though estranged here, it still focuses just on that, which I enjoyed. \\n\\n\r\nThough I disliked the first four-five episodes or so, the later episodes were all generally humorous and enjoyable. I don't think I would recommend it, however, unless you fit within that demographic I mentioned earlier, and if thats the case, you've probably already seen this anime by now.",

            "content": "I had heard about this anime everywhere on the Internet, and finally got around to watching it. Now this review won't revolve around the second season, that is for another day. This is mainly for the first season.\r\nOreimo is a 2010 anime that aired from October 3rd to December 19th. It's based on the light novel series by Tsukasa Fushimi and has twelve episodes for this season. It's from the studio AIC Build and is romantic-comedy/harem. \r\nIt revolves around Kyosuke Kosaka, a normal 17-year-old high school student living in Chiba and has not gotten along with his younger sister Kirino in years. It seemed asif the relationship between Ky\u014dsuke and his sister, now fourteen, would continue this way forever. One day however, Kyosuke finds a DVD case of a magical girl anime which had fallen in his house's entrance way. To Kyosuke's surprise, he finds a hidden eroge inside the case and he soon learns that both the DVD and the game belong to Kirino. That night, Kirino brings Kyosuke to her room and reveals herself to be an otaku with an extensive collection of moe anime and younger sister-themed eroge she has been collecting in secret.\\n\\n\r\nThe storyline I thought was very interesting. It revolved around Kirino and Kyosuke's relationship as brother and sister while seeing the everyday life of Kirino's otaku side. It was a different type of romantic-comedy/harem and I got a few good laughs out of it. \\n\\n\r\nThere were some characters I didn't like, like Kyosuke for he was just pretty bland to me. Kirino was very annoying at times but other times she made me laugh, and I thought she was a pretty good main character. The one character I truly liked out of this was Kuroneko/Ruri. She was most defiantly my favourite character and possibly one of my favourite female anime characters of all time. She was entertaining to watch, for when we met her she came off as this gothic otaku who didn't really talk much to this girl that was adorable in every single way possible. Saori was another good character, for the episode about her backstory didn't leave me feeling bored.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was your average anime style but sometimes there were ways the camera was angled that caught my attention. How it showed Kirino the first time in the series, along with the last. It was most definalty beautiful animation in of itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was nice to hear. The opening theme was catchy and I thought that ClariS was the perfect ones for the job. The song was upbeat and got you ready for what was in this show. The voice actors did an amazing job portraying their characters, most definalty Ayana Taketatsu as Kirino, Hitomi Nabatame as Saori and Saori Hayami as Ayase, Kirino's best friend. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Oreimo was really fun to watch. I had lots of laughs and lots of surprised moments, for the show did take serious turns once in a while, which I was shocked about. I recommend it, at least the first season, to anyone who's interested. \\n\\n\r\nI rate Oreimo 8/10 and give it 4/5 stars. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I've already watched both seasons of OreImo, and decided I wanted to rewatch them and write reviews for each section right after finishing them.\r\nIf you're on the fence about watching this show, here's how it is: OreImo is a damn good Romcom, and if you enjoy that kind of light hearted show, you should definitely watch it. \r\nExcept for the second season \"specials\", the true ending arc. Just... don't.\r\nI was worried that, as i know where everything is going, that I would have trouble simply enjoying this first season. Well, I didn't. It delivers everything it did the first time, and so, if you havea moment to waste, here are my full and honest impressions.\\n\r\nIn this first season, we are told the story of how Kyousuke, a peace loving, easygoing 17 year old, renews bonds with his sister, although no reason is ever given as to why those bonds were missing in the first place. The twist is, his sister, Kirino, star pupil, part time model, Track star-athlete, popular at school, and apparently perfect in every way, is a huge Otaku. \\n\r\nFor those who don't know, an otaku is what people who are into anime are called in Japan. But when I say \"into\", I don't mean they follow a show they like, or read manga here and there. i mean they practically dedicate all of their free time to anime, manga, graphic novels, galge, eroge, anything like that to an absolutely destructive excess. They are often considered disgusting by their fellow members of society.\\n\r\nSo obviously, Kyousuke is taken completely by surprise when he learns of his sister's secret. But he decides to float with it, and he provides her with support through various situations and difficulties that the young Kirino goes through.\\n\r\nAlthough i will say that there is very little feeling of progression throughout the series, this is a fun show. As I said, it's light-hearted and easy going. Plenty of laughs to be found here, and some endearing moments too. That's what makes any romcom a romcom anyway, right? Although, I guess the \"Rom\" side doesn't appear much till later, there are already some underlying tones of possible romance, especially between the Kyousuke and his childhood friend.\\n\r\nThe show works, even though little happens, there is ambient development in the characters relationships, and not just between the two siblings. Kirino makes other Otaku friends, and the way each person in this show interacts with each other has a natural \"meant to be\" kind of feeling. Although sometimes, a character (one in particular) will kind of *click and go slightly out of their role for a moment, these events often help show the viewer that maybe not everything is as it seems in this world that is clearly just getting ready for the main act.\\n\r\nYes, the fact of the matter is this: Season one feels like little more than a set up for the next one, and that's normal, since that's exactly what it is. The characters are being set up, we're learning to like these people and understand how they work. Which is why the final episode kind of drops out of nowhere, since it branches away from the original story to put things under wraps.\\n\r\nWhich is why the \"True arc ending\" exists.\\n\r\nI'm not sure what they were thinking, but apparently this show was far more successful than the creators had first anticipated, so they needed some way to bring the whole thing back to be able to make a second season without looking foolish. The last episode is underwhelming, and if by the end you're thinking, \"well, that was fun, but nothing really happened\" you better get your ass in gear for the true arc ending and the second season, since that's where everything is gonna happen, and it's gonna be damn awesome!\\n\r\nQuick mention for the opening song, which I think is damn fucking catchy. That's it.\\n\r\nAlso, when i first watched it, I knew nothing about the whole \"otaku\" culture that exists in japan, and if this show does one thing, it's give a good insight into what that otaku culture is. Although I'm sure it hardly even scratched the surface of the whole thing, it still taught me exactly how anime is seen by most Japanese people.\\n\r\nSo, in conclusion, this isn't a bad show in any way. It's a fun and enjoyable story, which in the end deserved a better ending than what it got, and got it in the end anyway.",

            "content": "So lets get this out of the way, this show was very weird for me to watch. As an older sibling to a younger sister, it was incredibly awkward for me personally to \"get over\" the vibes and sexual tension between the brother and his sister, though the show makes you want to believe it doesn't exist, but it does. I could go on a rant about this, but for sake of tolerance and overall enjoyment, I will leave this part of my opinion out of my review besides the fact that it was generally odd for me. Now that's done and finished, Oreimo wasgreat. I loved the gamer role that Kirino played as not only a gamer but Otaku. Its funny how easily I relate to this fear she has of her being \"found out\" for liking Eroge, and something that I can empathize with a lot, being almost identical in personality to her when I was younger. In fact, Kirino is my favorite part of the show, though she has some of the least desirable character traits ever (whiny, easily aggravated and prideful) yet she still was fun to watch and understand. Kyosuke was a bit more interesting, but not in such a bad way. He assists Kirino in her way of making it into a Otaku group of friends, and helps her along as a person. But again, he gives that odd incest esc vibe on occasion that makes that whole respect and understanding just die off (for me anyhow). All in all, a great watch for what I would think is the broad majority of Otaku, gamers and uneasy Otaku. Though be warned, \"incestual\" vibes run all around, and make some uncomfortable, but i'm sure it won't faze a lot of you, and I may just be part of a minority.",

I shall not say too much, but they're blood related.\r\nNow, back to the review.\r\n-\r\nThis, honestly, is my favorite anime besides \"Toradora!\"\r\nThe characters, of course, are the normal generic tsundere, derederes and kuuderes. Let me enlighten you, however. As the story progresses, you'll see that the protagonist thinks like an actual human being in certain situations. (Looking at you, *Subaru.)\r\nBase of the story, Kyousuke and his sister, Kirino never got along. *Sound familiar?\r\nKyousuke was minding his own business when he eyed an anime CD case on the ground. \r\nHe held onto it untilhe could find out who owned it, only to find out his sister, Kirino, not only owned that, but a whole secret closet\\n\r\nof nothing but otaku goods. The otaku goods were all related to little sisters. They've kept it a secret because their parents hate otakus.\\n\\n\r\nStory wise, I love it. Like I said, I don't wanna spoil anything. It's more feel good than it is serious. \\n\r\nIf you're looking for serious story, you've come to the wrong anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt wise, okay. Surprisingly simplistic. Extremely simplistic. Nothing like what Sakura-sou* had.\\n\\n\r\nSound wise...\\n\r\nNow this is the only downfall. I've watched the anime and played the VN / DS*. The music in the anime (Besides Op and ED music of course.) Is almost barely noticeable, which is incredibly sad, because it's almost drowned out... Nothing really sticks...\\n\r\nWell... Until you hear. \"MERUMERUMERUMERUMERUMERUMEEEEE.\" And it has such a good soundtrack, but it's only noticeable from the game. ;(\\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise, IT'S A TRICK!\\n\r\nWatching from beginning to end of season one, you expect it to just be redundant \"almost-made-a-move-now-story-goes-nowhere.\" kinda deal. But no, not at all. Once you reach season two, you find how unique they are. I CAN'T SPOIL ANYTHING. BUT BEWARE THE GLASSES.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 10 / 10 Too much water.\\n\r\nIt's a great anime, seriously. With pretty simple art and great story, you'll love it. Believe me. Seriously.\\n\r\nAnd for those who've watched it and HATE the ending, play the visual novel, as it acts as a completely separate season two.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nMinor flaws, but so freaking great. Don't get butt-hurt by the ending as anyone could see it a mile away.\\n\r\nIt's a feel good. If I could choose tags, it would be a Slice of Life / Comedy. Nothing romantic starts until second season.\\n\r\nAnd I state again, if you don't like the ending, PLEASE PLAY THE GAME OR WATCH *EROMANGA!\\n\\n\r\n*Subaru from Re;Zero.\\n\r\n*Eromanga Sensei and Oreimo take place in the same universe.\\n\r\n*Good anime, watch it.\\n\r\n*Visual Novel / Dating Sim.",

If the answer is yes then watch the series, if not then it is \"maybe watch this series\" because it could affect your overall enjoyment of what in most other aspects is a really solid series.\r\nIn the end I felt this could have been a good harem anime with a nice backstory about a confusing relationship between siblings. Had it followed a slightly more reasonable and realistic route that the estrangement of the siblings had become a confused love/hate relationship that resolved intoa weird \"love\" that went beyond the familial but resolved itself into a close but proper brother/sister relationship then I would probably have loved the whole thing start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nI actually ended up feeling a little bit angry at how the series managed to keep so far away from where the series ends making I think a casual viewer or someone who has picked up the series by chance feel they are watching a very different genre. I feel like it almost \"lies\" about itself and then springs on you it's \"true\" intentions and those intentions are not going to be very palatable outside it's very niche audience.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending utterly changes the whole feel of the series but not until after the full series is finished and we go into the S2 extra episodes. Light Novels apparently contain some extra content that makes some of the backstory more logical but unless you really get off on familial relationships taken into the taboo then I think it ends on a bit of a gut punch. Shame as I feel the characters were complelling, 90% of the plot was excellent and the show is a nice introduction to some of the Otaku lifestyle that a western audience may not be aware of.\\n",

            "content": "Ahh, Oreimo, what a weird trip this anime was. So, I was a bit sketched out at first when deciding to watch Oreimo, quite frankly the sister stuff kinda freaking bugs me in anime, but after watching another series a little bit that had a similar premise I found myself going into the daily life of the Kousaka siblings and the other weird and eccentric characters in the show.\r\nAs you know this series IS about a relationship between a brother and a sister, I actually jumped to conclusions that this would be trash but I actually found myself rather enjoying it. \r\nI rate the storyas a 6 mainly because its not really something new, and it wasn't like it was really that great of a story anyways, it was more like a slice of life harem romcom to me just with the sister/brother stuff going on and the eroge. \\n\\n\r\nAs for art I must say that the art is quite frankly one of my favorite parts about the show, the art is actually pretty well done, and it fits the theme of the story and the scenes when it needs to overall making my enjoyment level a bit higher then it would have been.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in the show I would rate highly because of the OP not being complete trash like most harems/romcoms. I actually thought the OP wasnt really garbage but I even more so liked how when I listened to the characters the voice actors really did fit them and didn't make my ears bleed like other animes that I have watched.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the show aren't actually really THAT bad, the main character, yes he is your typical normal character but overall I do like how he goes out of his way from time to time for his sister, and even then he changed throughout the show which is ANOTHER thing I must say I liked, both of the Kousakas were stuck right up there ass but somehow managed to fix that shitty relationship of a brother and sister.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment level of the series is basically a 6 primarily because again its nothing you HAVEN'T seen before, its just actually not so bad as to its execution and quite frankly even if its not entirely different I like the direction its heading into the second season and will probably watch it.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint with the show is some of the cringey scenes that make otaku culture go over the top, it gets to be a bit much at times. Plus people can easily take this as a normal brother+sister problem relationship at their age and hows its normal. I frankly ended up liking the fact that it was like that, but I know it wouldnt be other peoples cup of tea.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think Oreimo isn't a bad series at all, I think its much more of a comedy about 2 dumb siblings currently then the romance, I kinda see it coming in a second season but I must say that this might be an anime that if you judge it by its cover or title you might be missing a possibly enjoyable series, and this is coming from someone who didn't want to step foot into the world of Oreimo for 3 years. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I've written this same review for season two of this anime, and while I've given both anime the seasons the same score due to being the same show, I just want to point this important thing out!\r\nFor personal reasons I enjoyed season two a lot more. Sorry for being so vague but I must avoid spoilers, after all. I hope you enjoy this anime as much as I did!\r\nThe story itself for this anime is great. The protagonist and his tsundere-like little sister have a relationship that makes the viewers love them both and at other times feel so sorry for the MC for howhe some times gets treated. I myself couldn't help myself at certain scenes of romance from tearing up and sobbing from how great the delivery was. \\n\\n\r\nThe ART work as well was quite special as each character really had their own unique kind of appearance. That goes for almost any anime, but this one in particular was really enjoyable to watch, as each character's facial expression and animation was truly pleasant at almost all times.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with the Story, the SOUND is what I'll remember the most in this anime. The voice acting is great of course, but what really had me was the music. Occasionally, the sad themed music would play and it was so well timed that it's as if that music became a trigger for the watter works! And when the MC would be with various girls, of course including his sister, very happy, fun music will play that I absolutely loved listnening to. Whoever produced the sound for this anime, if they're not widely recognised already I definitely think they should be!!\\n\\n\r\nAs far as characters go, I think I've said enough about that so far. However, one thing I need to point out is that I watched Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sakunai BEFORE watching this. And that anime left me with a void that I could NOT fill at all. However, Ore no Imouto filled that void with its loveable storyline, music and characters. It was also great to find similar characters, which I'm sure you'll see what I mean once you've watched both series!\\n\\n\r\nIf you've read this whole review, I thank you very much! I rarely write reviews on MyAnimeList because it takes a fair bit of time due to MAL's post length demands. But... OreImo is worth writing a review for and I'm probably gonna rewatch it!",

Although I didn't expect it when starting out, it did manage to strike some of the 'feels', something which is never a bad thing. The story has this wonderful tendency to jump between light-hearted and serious, and it does it in a mature way, whichdoesn't feel forced.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also intriguing. Although I wouldn't say that our main character is particularly 'special', the supporting cast have varying personalities which all contribute to progressing the story in a meaningful way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would say that you should give this one a shot if you enjoy drama, romance, or just something a little 'different'.

            "content": "ore no imouto ga konnani kawaii wake ga nai, otherwise known as oreimo, is a rather interesting take on a seemingly mundane brother / sister relationship. in comparison to other anime's focusing on such relations, oreimo features a refreshing and intriguing interpretation on things, as it follows 17 year old kyousuke, and the endeavours he faces in wholehearted attempts to ease the trials and tribulations of his 14 year old sister, kirino.\r\nkirino is blessed with beauty, academic success, and notable athletic abilities. thus, letting her be seen as an idolised overachiever, and seemingly \" perfect \". all the while, kyousuke lives life with an easygoingattitude; not particularly excelling in anything, and just blending in. for reasons initially unbeknown, the two are on particularly bad terms. they don't interact unnecessarily, and when they do, an altercation of sorts is likely to come forth. as such, the two live their lives without involvement of the other. well, that is until the day the aforementioned \" perfect \" girl, mistakenly allows her magical girl dvd case, to be discovered by her brother. to make matters worse, the contents inside were actually that of an eroge, depicting and romanticising lecherous acts betwixt siblings.\\n\\n\r\nnotwithstanding their previously strained relationship, this unorthodox discovery grants the two means to build a new foundation. being the accepting type that he is, kyousuke assured kirino he would not judge for her secret hobby of being an otaku. as such she finds a confidant in him, and while the two still ultimately fail to see eye-to-eye, kyousuke unconditionally helps kirino resolve the troubles she's bound to face as she willingly enters an otaku world, while keeping her unblemished record in the eyes of both her parents and peers.\\n\\n\r\nthe animation is consistently superb and the featured soundtracks are all topnotch. the characters all have far more depth to them than you're initially lead on to believe. there's noticeable development in the characters respectively as well as with the bonds they share. things will generally follow the brothers point of view, and before long he'll find himself in a harem-like situation. a few romances appear to be on the cusp of flourishing as some unique predicaments are undergone. while it's not riddled with cliche ecchi mishaps, some do appear here and there. there's a surprising amount of despondent intensity thrown in amidst the lighthearted comedic value the episodes have to offer.\\n\\n\r\nall in all, while some redundant themes may come to your attention, it's worth watching.",

            "content": "*Warning may contain spoilers*\r\nThis review will only cover the 1st season and the 4-episode OVA, as I have yet to watch the 2nd season at the time of writing. Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai, aka Oreimo was honestly quite a difficult anime for me to write a review on. There were a number of things that I really disliked about the show, namely many of the characters. However, there are alot of very interesting themes and elements presented in the plot which made the show very enjoyable: the brother-sister relationship, otakus, and the friendship that can arise from people sharing commoninterests.  \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 8\\n\r\nOn the surface, Oreimo appears to be a slice of life anime about the two brothers and sisters, Kyousuke and Kirino who became closer to each other after Kyousuke discovers his sister's obsession for animes and eroge, and he begins to develop a common interest for them. The thing that I think makes the story in Oreimo interesting is that while the format of the show appears to be a standard episodic slice-of-life anime with random events happening in each episode, there are always common elements present throughout these episodes that together are very coherent and enjoyable to watch. \\n\\n\r\nContrary to many other reviews, I think the show does present the brother-sister relationship in a very realistic way. As an older brother myself, Kyousuke does behave in a way that I think an ideal older brother should. He gives advice to Kirino, helps her out with all of her problems, tries to share her interests (yes, despite the fact that its eroge), and does genuinely show love, affection and protectiveness as most older brothers do. While I think Kirino's character is certainly exaggerated, she does to a certain degree act in a way that most younger sisters do. Yes they can be spoiled, loud, constantly demand for attention, and act in a very unreasonable way, but sometimes that's just how the relationship is, and their own way of showing their love for their older siblings. \\n\\n\r\nWhile I agree that there are certain 'siscon' tendencies in this anime, nothing is ever blatant and there's never any romantic or sexual interactions between them. There are no romantic elements in this show (at least in the 1st season) so if that's what you're looking for then I suggest you should look elsewhere. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a number of other elements that are explored throughout the 12 episodes, such as the world of otakus and how they're perceived by others in society, and different types and forms of friendship between people who share common interests. These interesting elements are what really drives the plot in each episode and kept me going till the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9\\n\r\nThe art is great, and one of the best aspect of this show. Every element is drawn to a great level of detail, especially the character designs which are all beautiful and very well done.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8\\n\r\nMusic is generally good and goes well with the anime. I especially like all the voice acting in this show, very well done, and fits well with all the characters. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 6\\n\r\nThis is easily one of the worst aspects of the show.\\n\\n\r\nKyousuke was one of the few characters that I actually liked. He is kind, reliable, helpful and dependable. Yes he does appear like a generic male MC at times, but he was one of the only character that I could relate to. I understood his actions, way of thinking and even the way that he treated Kirino. He was simply a kind and helpful older brother who often spoiled his little sister too much.\\n\\n\r\nKirino is very spoiled, cold and demanding to Kyousuke and most of the time behaves in the most unreasonable ways - in other words a standard tsundere character. She only behaves in this way with Kyousuke - seemingly putting on another personality when around her other friends. However, while Kirino's character is certainly exaggerated, this is at least relatable and somewhat realistic to the way that younger siblings sometimes behave. \\n\\n\r\nKuroneko is your typical cynical gothic character. I liked her character in the first season, she was smart and knew how to stand up for herself. She was proud of her interests in anime and who she really was, and while she appears to be harsh to her friends at times, she's also proven to be kind and caring. However, during the OVA it appears she begins to fall in love with Kyousuke and her character regresses into a generic tsundere character. Her behaviour becomes unreasonable towards Kyousuke, she continuously refuses his help but at the same time secretly craves for his attention - in other words she became another replica of Kirino in her absence. \\n\\n\r\nAyase is Kirino's best friend, and appears to be a kind and gentle character, however she becomes very angry and violent, especially to Kyousuke. She clearly expresses her dislike for him, but yet continuously asks him for help with \"Kirino issues\" - in other words, another tsundere character. At times it seems like she may have feelings for Kyousuke, however this remains unclear as of season 1.\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the main problems that I have with this anime, the three female characters mentioned so far are all generic tsunderes, which eventually became boring and irritating to watch. They are all unreasonably hostile and violent towards Kyousuke but yet appears to have some feelings for him. Meanwhile, other more interesting characters never seem to get enough screen time. \\n\\n\r\nOn a more positive note, Saori is a very interesting character. She is kind, dependable and is the only voice of reason in the trio of friends. While she appears like a geeky otaku, it is clear that there is more to her character than it seems. Sadly she never gets enough screen time or development to become anymore important to the show.\\n\\n\r\nManami is another very interesting character, and one which I really liked. She is kind, reliable, caring and determined. She appears to have feelings for Kyousuke, however he is largely oblivious to this. In my opinion Kyousuke doesn't deserve her feelings and she can certainly do much better.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 8\\n\r\nSurprisingly, I found this anime quite enjoyable to watch. While some of the characters are rather boring and irritating to watch, the slice of life plot on the daily life of otakus and anime lovers, the struggles in the daily life of siblings and the stories of friendship is what kept me going till the end.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, Oreimo is not a bad show - it has alot of very interesting elements and together they make up a very interesting slice of life anime. If you're easily annoyed by generic and unreasonable tsundere characters then this might not be the best show for you, but otherwise it might be worth giving it a go. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Oh, man. This show. Even a while after finishing it, I can't decide whether I enjoyed it or not--as well as if it was worth the time spent. If you have regularly enjoyed Tsundere-centric shows in the past, or any breed of romantic comedy, this show will most likely appeal to you in some way, shape or form. And if you aren't, it might be worth watching a couple episodes of just to see. \r\nNow, while I did have good times watching this show, there were plenty of times I didn't. For one, the premise of \"perfect girl with an extremely otaku side seldom seen\"isn't something I'm a particular fan of. The \"siblings with very strong feelings\" theme is usually not the best, either, but is--as you most definitely know--the center of this show's story. If that doesn't appeal to you, find something else. \\n\\n\r\nThe character design and development were well paced--albeit a little fast at times, but was mostly well-done. Most of all, though, I have extremely mixed feelings about how the show wrapped up. No spoilers here, but I felt the ending resolved absolutely nothing. Do you remember that feeling you had after you watched the last episode of Berserk? That little, nagging, \"was I imagining that? And if I wasn't, what... huh?\"\\n\r\nWell, that's how I felt about this ending. The last few episodes left me with a bittersweet, yet somehow fuzzy feeling which I have not quite come to terms with. That being said, the story as a whole is definitely up to par, and the art is always nice to look at, if you can't find anything else to enjoy. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I'll be honest here. I didn't expect much from this anime. The concept didn't sound that great, the characters looked like your generic harem cast, and the title was almost laughable. Not only was it ridiculously long, but when you hear the translation of it for the first time, you're guaranteed to crack up. So, after watching the show, did I change my mind? Let's take a look at 'My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute'. ...Pfffft-\r\nStory (5/10):\r\nOreImo is quite obviously a bit of an otaku fantasy. \"A tsundere little sister who is extremely pretty, but also enjoys anime, and adult video games? Sign meup!\" Of course, there's nothing wrong with that, but as a result, you shouldn't expect a masterpiece. The concept is just kind of lame.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some positive things to it though. Although the concept might not be that great, the execution is pretty decent. The comedy is well written, especially during certain character interactions. It even had me laughing a bit, which is rare, since I'm not really a fan of the Japanese style of humor.\\n\r\nThe writers of the series also do a pretty good job with the dramatic moments as well, and actually create some memorable scenes. I wouldn't call them tearjerkers, but they definitely pack a punch. \\n\\n\r\nThere's also something that OreImo does that I didn't quit expect. It's not a harem. In fact, there's almost no romance in here too, which is quite surprising, considering it does look like it at first. One male character surrounded by pretty girls spells out romance, and harem to me. Saying that though, there are some romantic moments at the end, but for the most part, it's more of a character driven comedy. \\n\\n\r\nThere is one big flaw with the story though. There are a few arcs, where it doesn't just jump the shark. It builds a trampoline, harpoons 10 sharks, stacks them up on top of each other, and MAKES A SALTO OVER THEM THAT CAN REACH THE HEAVENS. Yeah, the plot can get pretty crazy. Most notably is the arc where Kirino, the little sister, makes a light novel. Well, good for her right? She found a hobby, and learns to write! Maybe one day, she'll- oh. It got published. Well, she must really have a talent, especially since this is novel seems to have been made in a few week- oh. It got an anime. Wow, she must be incredible! Maybe the story will evolve with her becoming active in the industry? What's that? It never gets mentioned again after the arc? ...Seriously?!\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10):\\n\r\nThe art of OreImo is definitely one of the highlights. The colours look very nice indeed, giving a very upbeat tone to the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs also look quite good. While Kyousuke might look kind of generic, the other female characters all have their unique designs, which reflect their personality. Also, I have to give props to the designers, who gave a lot of the characters different outfits for them to wear, which is a really nice touch. All in all, the art is pretty damn good.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10):\\n\r\nThe soundtrack though, is nothing special. Really, it's just your generic slice-of-life OST, and there are no tracks that I could memorize on the top of my head. It's forgettable to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really care for openings, and endings, but I do have to give a special note that each episode has a different ending theme, which is kind of refreshing. Each ending is accompanied by a picture that reflects the episode, either being the picture of the character that the episode focused on, or a picture of a certain moment in the episode. This adds some points in an otherwise forgettable OST.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10):\\n\r\nLet's start with the male lead, Kyousuke. I have to say, Kyousuke is probably one of the best characters in the show, which is surprising, since the male leads in these types of shows are pretty bland most of the time. While Kyousuke is your typical 'nice guy', he does show some unique traits, and twists. He's lazy, sarcastic, and has a surprisingly fun relationship with most of the girls, especially Ayase, who he teases in an incredibly funny way. The most important quality though, is the twist on his 'nice guy' attitude. Sure, he helps almost all the girls he comes across in your typical male-lead fashion, but he also has his own needs, and desires, and only does the things he does because he wants to. Yeah, he sacrifices his reputation on more than one occasion for the sake of the girls, but the way he does it is actually quite brave, ballsy, and feels surprisingly natural.\\n\\n\r\nThe female lead, Kirino however, leaves much to be desired. She's a typical tsundere, with the only unique quality of her is being a bit more of a bitch to her brother. Also, she's an otaku, which is a fun quirk, but nothing that changes my opinion of her character. However, she improves at the end of the series, showing a bit more respect to her brother, and also becomes more open to her otaku interests, which makes her a lot more entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, you have the typical cast. The childhood friend Manami, the yandere Ayase, and the weird, extreme otaku girl Saori. While all of them entertaining (excluding Manami, who is just a very boring, and uninteresting character), they don't really have any backstory, or depth. \\n\\n\r\nThe last character I'll talk about is Kuroneko, arguably the best character in the series. Kuroneko is basically that elitist anime fan. You know those people who claim that \"back in their day the anime industry was a lot better\". Yeah, those people.However, they actually didn't make her a completely annoying character, and she turned out very interesting indeed. She has several fun quirks, roleplaying that she is in an anime, giving her a lot of funny moments. She's also the character with the most development, turning from an ice-queen to a nice, and relatable girl. Plus, she's the only character that can be entertaining on her own, without the need of Kyousuke, which is the biggest compliment I can give for a character in this show. All in all, a pretty damn good character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10):\\n\r\nWhile the characters are generally good, and entertaining, the downfall of this series is definitely it's story. The story arcs aren't that interesting, and when they are, it's for the wrong reasons. The dialogue, and characters however, do save this anime from being completely generic. So, would I recommend this anime? Well, it depends. You do have to look at the title, and realize that, yes, this is an anime with incest-themes. If you are completely against this, then no, I'd recommend you skip it. If not, then I will recommend this anime if you are into romantic comedies. And hey! If you don't like the anime, then the creators actually give you a bailout card! You see, they actually made two endings for this series. The true-ending, which continues the story for the upcoming installments, and the good-ending, which concludes this series, so you won't have to watch the next season, and specials, giving you a decent conclusion to the show. \\n\\n\r\n\"Better than the title, but that wasn't a hard bar to reach.\"",

            "content": "Before I go into the specifics I would like to say one thing. All of these are my own beliefs and I do not expect anyone to completely agree with them or agree with them at all. But as a person who have watched almost all genre of anime, and countless number of shows (I do not really feel like adding all to my profile), I believe my opinion may help someone who has trouble deciding \"Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga nai!\" is worth their time or not. \r\nEnjoyment:\r\nUnlike other reviews, I will tell you this. I predict that 90% of theviewers will enjoy the show and never no why. There is not much in the show, but it manages to hook its viewers with its mysterious aura. It presents itself as another generic anime with  small twists. That's it. Nothing out of the ordinary. Some twists are even predictable. And yet every time I ask have you enjoyed the show, they reply with a solid yes. \\n\\n\r\nStory / Various aspects of the story:\\n\\n\r\nStory is nothing spectacular. Small stories that lead to a predictable ending is all i can really say. The basis of the show however, talks a lot about the anime culture and can be relate-able to viewers. It is nice to see another anime that talks about why criticism against people with different hobbies is wrong. This particular message was nice but the other message wasn't. I wouldn't say it was necessarily promoting incest, but it was indirectly doing it. If I understood it correctly, it would say \"Love has no barrier\" or \"Love can beat everything\". The only problem with this is that society has such a negative perspective on incest, that the first time watching the show, it felt wrong. Of course the producers weren't going for this completely, but every time you snap out an realize the show is about incest, you will think to yourself why you are watching it. \\n\\n\r\n*Another genre that I did not expect from the show was comedy. Every episode there was at least one scene that made me laugh. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are quite bland in the beginning, but begins to develop towards the end of the season getting prepared for the second season. Though they are bland, they are believable than most anime characters. The way they act is human and less of a fictional character.\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend it?\\n\r\nI would definitely recommend the show. If you ask me, I would have a hard time answering. But if you want a show that will lift you up and make you laugh, this is the show for you. \\n\\n",

In the manga though, Kirino was a little bit more \"dere\" and a little less \"tsun\" than she was in the anime (she hits and yells at Kyousuke more in the anime). The art is very cute! I actually preferred the art in the anime over the art in the manga. The animation is smoothand I just really enjoyed it. The characters are cute and all very great in their own ways. Of course, they varied from their manga counterparts (as I mentioned above) but, the anime is still just as enjoyable! I personally really enjoyed it and thought it was well done!",
