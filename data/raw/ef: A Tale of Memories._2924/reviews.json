However, not all shows with those basic ingredients have done so. What made this show so special then?\r\nI guess the characters, and the way they were portrayed. They were all struggling... struggling with their dreams. What to do. Who to be with. That was portrayed in such a way that I completely fell into it, with my entire mind. It was as if I was standing next to them, having to watch them struggle through their dreams and loves...forcing me to cry, both in the good and bad times they were experiencing. Also, the animation and the way the scenes were made was really beautiful and enjoyable. It was something I've never seen before, and normally I'd probably say that it was weird, I guess. But with this show... it just fit in so perfectly. The ending of this show was also something that was enjoyable. When I started watching the show, I'd never think about the ending it had, and I'd definitely not like the idea of such an ending. However, after having watched it, I msut say that it was indeed the perfect way to sum it all up. It couldn't have been done more beautifully, not the slightest inch better. Not at all.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is truly one of the best shows I've watched, and I think that anyone who enjoys a tear-jerking show will love this show. Fully and completely.\\n\\n\r\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)",

            "content": "\u201cPut your wishes into the memories you do not want to forget\u2026\u201d\r\nEf \u2013 a tale of memories is one of those anime that will probably stay in your memory and will be used as a standard to compare with other similar series in the future. Why in the future? Because the entire series is so beautifully made that there is only a very small handful of shows that are worth comparing it to at present time. In fact, as far as animation quality and technique are concerned Ef \u2013 a tale of memories is one of a kind and will most likely remain sofor some time to come.\\n\\n\r\nThe unique animation style is first shown in the first OP. While colourful images and sceneries directly taken out from the anime itself often proved to be an effective foreshadowing device (and a good way to capture viewers attention), the exact opposite apparently also work! With a simple coloured background plus a bunch of text, and some occasional symbolic representation of certain character/event, the OP of Ef \u2013 a tale of memories can be quite addictive to watch. Aside from the OP, the anime itself is equally impressive (if not more impressive). Extremely high quality animation is just a standard for this show. What makes it truly unique are the camera angles used in difference scenes, or in some cases the very effective use of repetitive text on the screen. The former often give viewers a greater view of things and present some background of the setting, while the latter case, the simple words and phrases are enough to advance the plot and at the same time depicts the mental state of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nViewers will most likely find the beginning of Ef \u2013 a tale of memories hard to follow. This can be attributed to the introduction of most (if not all) of the primary casts in the first episode. However, it was necessary to introduce all the seemingly unrelated characters at once since the storyline focuses deeply on the various characters\u2019 developments. It should also be pointed out that a few of the secondary characters will actually become the main characters of the sequel, Ef \u2013 a tale of melodies. Thus becoming familiar with the sideline characters now will serve as a good foundation for the sequel. \\n\\n\r\nThere are two parallel plots occurring simultaneously. The first involve a simple love triangle between a guy and two girls (somewhat similar to True Tears for those who have seen it), personally I did not find this plot particularly well written. However, the second plot is what makes Ef \u2013 a tale of memories shine like a bright star among numerous other anime of the same genre (it is also where the title of the anime came from!). The concept of the second story was designed to move ones\u2019 heart. It was built around pity and sadness. It was written in a way such that viewers will unconsciously find the couple destined to be together, yet due to some circumstances, made it near impossible for them to stay together. Overall, the story and characters are there to evoke a mixed array of emotions from us, the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, the entire show is beautifully executed. This includes the music as well. From the BGM in the prelude episode to the OP to the BGM throughout the series to the ending, they all fulfill their purpose very nicely and matches perfectly with the particularly scene at that particularly moment. Personally, it was the amazing OP (plus stunning animation from the OP) that caught my attention to this series. The music are largely composed by Tenmon who happened to be the music composer of other great shows such as 5 Centimeters per Second, Voices of a Distant Star, The Place Promised in Our Early Days, et cetera. \\n\\n\r\nEf \u2013 a tale of memories is truly a great romance anime that all romance suckers should not miss. From unbelievably stunning animation to music to characters to story, there is hardly anything to complain about this show (aside from the lack of \u201cbig name\u201d seiyu which some people care about). On the whole, Ef \u2013 a tale of memories is, without a doubt, one of the top romance anime of the decade.",

            "content": "ef - A Tales of Memories is a Psychological, Romance, Drama that may seem like all the other romance anime based of a visual novel (dating sim), yet there is something special about this one.\r\nVideo Alternative\r\nThe first episode of the series may seem pretty confusing and hard to follow, as the viewer is dragged, from one situation to another. However once you&rsquo;ve grasped the concept, it quickly becomes clear that this series is made up of two separate, main stories. From then on the show becomes easy to follow and to enjoy, for its uniqueness. There are so many twists and turns that are ableto turn any anime cliche into a work of art.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great and very well defined, as they all developed in their own way, throughout the story. You will have some that are involved in a tangled web of romance, others with their own psychological issues and one in particular that is suffering from an illness (which I must say, has never been portrayed so well in a long time). These characters are then able to show a mixed array of emotions and in turn, makes us viewers feel a mixed array of emotions whilst watching them.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and music quality are one of the best points as it illustrates scenes in such a way that you&rsquo;ll forget this anime was based of a visual novel (dating sim). This is just another one of the few SHAFT works that boast superb and somewhat unique artistic animation style and quality. The music is pretty amazing in its own way, with some really catchy OP and ED themes and during the show itself; there&rsquo;s also a wide collection of piano and violin melodies.\\n\\n\r\nOverall ef- A Tales of Memories proved to be a truly captivating romance anime that excelled, far above expectations. Having to go up against the mighty titan that is &ldquo;Clannad&rdquo;, this short anime series proved to be a worthy opponent. It&rsquo;s a very enjoyable series to watch, as each episode brings forth an interesting development however some of these developments can make anyone feel slightly disturbed. But it's this that sets the anime series apart, from all else. If you have a soft spot for romance anime, then there is no chance you'll be disappointed with this work of art. \\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "ef - a tale of memories had everything to be just another harem show adapted from an eroge. The season also brought the incredibly antecipated Clannad, so many wouldn't have given this show a second thought. However, the way such a simple story was developed is different from any other eroge adaptation that has seen the light of day so far.\r\nThe story isn't that original if you think about it. Dependable girls that simply need the protagonist, a dose of drama here and there. You're certain you've seen it all before until there were twists you weren't expecting. Somehow, the distant story feels all themore reachable, that it doesn't seem like just another story anymore. The hurt, the love, the helplessness, it is easier to connect to them than you'd have thought, and although the pacing may be a bit fast, you'll be caught thinking &quot;Hey, if it were me, would I do diferently?&quot;\\n\\n\r\nThe art is unique. Some may question it, say that it ruins the atmosphere of drama and turns it into another &quot;SHAFT Freak Show&quot;. But that is not true. The colors are so vivid, it's like you're watching the emotions themselves. The facial expressions, the sky, the ocean. Everthing looks so bright and detailed, you wonder why no one thought about doing this before. Dark colors when the characters are down, shining colors when they're bursting with happiness. It's like a moving portrait. A work of ark.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in ef is essential. Due to the eccentric art, there are times you can feel the tension rising through the background sound and the work of the seiyuus. The sound is sublime and as touching as the story itself. It's unpredictable and touching, and completely fitting for every situation. Each girl has their own theme, which show their hopes and fears. Not to mention the theme of the anime, Euphoric Field; even though it may have Engrish lyrics like so many others, it's shows completely what the show is about: hope.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are more than they seem to be. What's most impressive about ef is how you can easily connect to the character's feelings. There are some flaws, yes, in the development. But the feelings are easy to connect and comprehend, the jealousy, the desperation, the love. The girls may be but princesses waiting for rescue, but their feelings can be dark and shadowed by real human flaws. And as each episode passes, you can see them grow, their emotions grow.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, ef had everything to be 'just another show'. But between the two main stories, you're caught wanting more. It succeeds where many others have failed, at some times, being more touching than the big hit Clannad. But don't let the fact that it's a small series trick you. Have an open mind and embrace the emotional wreck that is ef. There are funny moments? Sure, why not. It's like the calm before the storm, and they lighten up the mood, almost trying to not prepare you for the worst. But ef is a drama series, and at that, it succeeds. And between all other 'drama' shows this season, it is the number one.",

            "content": "I decided to watch this anime after watching some AMVs. I've always despised the art style of this anime (big heads, pentagonal faces and skinny characters don't really appeal me), but the animation was gorgeous, which motivated me.\r\nStory: 5.\r\nThe story doesn't pick up until episode 5. I almost dropped watching it because it's boring at first, but it does get better as it goes, and since it's actually a short anime, I recommend watching it all. This anime could be divided in three stories. Sadly, aside from Renji and Chihiro's part, the story is very poor. If you're looking for a more complex, mind blowingstory, I recomend not watching this. While I love drama and I respect the director's decision to stage it in a unique way, some of the most dramatic parts in this anime are laughable, Like when Chihiro falls at the beach and Renji reaches out for her, or when Renji breaks down in later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6.\\n\r\nHere I devide it in two, visual style and animation. For visual style: 3, animation: 9. As I said before, I'm not fond of deformed characters, with extremely huge heads (like Miyamura's), but it's not for me to state my personal preferences in this review. I really like how a lot of the scenes in this anime look like vectors moving, it was really original and it's what I like the most about this anime (the opening itself is a very good example of it).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10.\\n\r\nI have nothing to say here. It's really good from the very beginning to the very end. All songs are brilliant and it blends in magically. \"Euphoric Field\" is something you'll want to put in your iPod right away.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8.\\n\r\nFor a 12-episode anime, the characters develop pretty well, each following their own pace. Most notably are Kei and Chihiro. Miyako also changes a bit at the end, but overall, she's your tipical annoying, childish girl.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.\\n\r\nThis anime has a very serious problem: you'll find youserlf glued to the screen at some point while watching it (episode 11 speaks for itself), but at other parts you'll just yawn and think about dropping watching it (like when Miyako calls Hiro in episode 7 and 10).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.\\n\r\nIt could've been better written, but it wasn't a waste of time watching it. I'm still in love with it's animation and vector-like style (can I call this 4 wall breakage? I really enjoy that. Google it if you don't know what it means). It's not an anime I'd recommend to others, but if people asked me if it's worth watching it or not, I'd simply say: It's good.",

            "content": "I almost dropped this anime, but since it only had 12 episodes, I kept watching. I'm not saying it's a crappy anime, but I didn't like it. And there are reasons. Lots of them.\r\nStory   \r\nThe story is pretty easy to follow, even though it's actually more like two stories and not just one. I don't see the idea of having two stories, though. Although they are somehow related, I really don't understand it. That put aside, the story is quite basic with a few things that make it different to your normal anime story, but if you don't think about these few things,it kind of seems like you have seen the anime before somewhere. The way I look at it, this story doesn't have a plot worth talking about. It just revolves around some teenagers with some problems, and that's about it. Of course the problems might be a little odd, but that doesn't make me rate it any better.\\n\r\nHowever, I did like the ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt   \\n\r\nThe background scenery and the drawings were very well made. There were a lot of colors, and the animation worked very good too. One thing I'm extremely dissatisfied with is the overuse of colors to describe how a person feels. Suddenly a person is drawn entirely in black and white, and on other ocassions the same person is drawn glowing red. I fully understand the use of this, but I just.. hate it. I think it makes it far too antirealistic (not that I hate antirealism, I just don't think it fits to this kind of anime). I also don't like the way some of the scenes function. Example: One of the main persons is talking to another main person. Suddenly the camera switches focus to the lips of that person (It's a girl, that's why), and then to somewhere completely else. A few second later there's another change in scenes, and it continues that way. I get the idea, but I think that changing scenes all the time is, well, annoying. It's not that you can't follow what's happening, it's just that I think it's more or less meaningless (especially when it's used all the time).\\n\r\nA lot of people might say that I simply don't understand real art. And that's true. I do not understand art. Period. I just want everything to be simple, yet useful. And that applies to everything in my world - not just anime. And by &quot;simple&quot;, I don't necessarily mean drawings without details. That would be a shame. I mean that there shouldn't be anything that's far out with no meaning in particular. That's what I think...\\n\\n\r\nSound   \\n\r\nThere's not really much to say about the sound. It works. I don't think it's bad, and I don't think it's amazing. It's just plain good. A thing that bothers me is, however, that this anime, like a lot of other animes, used some English lyrics. In my opinion, the English/Japanese mix wasn't good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter   \\n\r\nThe characters were (mostly) types I had seen before, but I honestly don't care about that. There were different personalities, some of them being complete contractions of one of the other characters, while some of them were more similar to each other. All of the characters were well thought up.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment   \\n\r\nAs stated earlier, I almost dropped this show. I did enjoy some parts of the anime, but then again, a lot of the time I was just bored. Because this wasn't a comedy, I thought I would have a nice time watching some drama, but I never really liked it. It missed an exciting plot that would've made me watch it with enjoyment. Sure, I did cry a little sometimes, but that's not uncommon for me.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\r\nIf you think your way of thinking is similar to how I think of thinking (hmm..), I wouldn't recommend this anime.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you like going to art museums or something like that (to me museums equal hell x 1000), there's a chance you'll like this.\\n\\n\r\nBut I didn't.",

Don't be mad because I didn't stopped writing my f*cked up reviews, I only do it for the fun, if you like them, thank you very much, if you hate them then you shouldn't read them at all, whaha! =D\r\nStory\r\nIf there is an anime with a good story, then it's Ef - A Tale Of Memories. I saw alot of 'drama' animes but I think Ef - A Tale Of Memories is the best so far. At the beginning, you won't understand the story, neither did I. But don't stop after the first episode, it's really gonna get much better andyou'll understand the situation! This is a story where you really could cry about.. If you like drama and romance you'll just gonna love this, wait and see.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art of Ef - A Tale Of Memories is a very big pluspoint! This anime has a very unique art that's well made. In some scenes something changes, I don't really know how to explain this because I'm dutch, just watch it for yourself. But I never seen something like this before, like I said, it's just unique. Maybe I'll see this as the anime with the best art from 2007, maybe also the best story.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nIt's hard to say something about this. The songs are awesome, the sound is how it needs to be, and that's everything I can say. But I'm sure that the sound isn't the most important thing for watching a anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe characters of this anime are also unique. Each of them has their own story, something that I love. Miyako, Chihiro, Renji, Hiro and the rest are just awesome. BUT the character that I really hate is Kei, who does she think she is?! I'd seen alot of people who also hate her and I can understand, you also will if you watch it. I NEVER saw a character who is so selfish as Kei, I really can't stand the fact why she is in such a good anime. But she doesn't messes it up for me because I'm sure that she's gonna lose and I can't wait to see that! I love every character but just not Kei, you're my friend if you think the same, haha! =D\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nIf you want comedy, then you're at the wrong place. I don't think that this is supossed to be funny, even though every anime has their funny moments. But this is really a drama/romance, mostly drama I think, so if you're not a drama-type at all, don't watch this. I'd warn you! Back at the good part: If you LOVE drama then this is a MUST see anime! I really enjoy this with all my animeheart! =D Let's get our handkerchiefs ready for the rest of this anime!\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI couldn't help my myself.. I give it a 10! Some people will call me crazy because maybe they're not into drama, well get out of here! This is my review, muwhaha. All the people who want to watch this now: I wish you a great time watching this awesome anime! &lt;3\\n\\n\r\nReview writen by: Erisu\\n\\n",

The story is incredibly, mind-blowingly generic, and the characters are so typical that I feel like I've seen them in dozens of other shows. On top of that, the \"artistic\" style of the anime was so distracting and ridiculous. I found myself laughing every time the scene became obnoxiously distorted or the colors changed, because it was so non-discrete and it never quit. Yes, this anime is pretty. But it's pretty in a way that makes it clear that it's trying way too hard to be beautiful and artistic. All in all,this anime was painful to watch. It was not deep nor creative like it tried so hard to be.",

            "content": "Stumbling across Tale of Memories amongst the sea of eroge adaptations is akin to finding a piece of artwork rivaling the Mona Lisa in playboy. Something so rare that its likely to be met by skepticism by friends till they experience the most unlikely gem themselves.\r\nThe premise of Tale of Memories isn't exactly original. It details the story of two guys. One who helps a girl who can only remember events for 13 hours achieve her dream. The other who must get over his indecisive nature before his love triangle becomes  School days (i.e, deadly). But then, the Mona Lisa is just a pictureof some chick smiling. The devil is in the details, and Memories tells these stories so flawlessly that you'll likely experience the joy and despair that each character faces first hand.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of episode 7, for example involved a girl whose phone calls went unanswered for a day. While this likely gets a standard 2 minute treatment of a girl acting moe is any other anime, memories combines astounding voice acting with unprecedented symbolic visuals to form a portrayal of mental breakdown so powerful that it'll likely send Chuck Norris into a stunned stupor. Given that I have already given Clannad 10 for animation, memories deserves at least 11.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in Memories is astounding. While most anime are content to simply use animation to show what is happening on the screen, Memories goes several steps further, playing with everything from color saturation, transparencies, to background abstraction and non-standard cropping to convey powerful emotions in every scene.\\n\\n\r\nThis attention to detail permeates through all aspects of the series. The minor differences between episodes in the OP, the sudden scenes without color, everything has a purpose. Memories is one of those rare shows that deserves a immediate rewatch, for it is a joy to notice all the meaningful details you missed the first time round.\\n\\n\r\nMemories only weakness is that like any piece of serious art, it is not friendly towards casual viewers. The first episode, with its unique presentation, and multiple intertwining characters, is likely to confuse. However, anyone who watches past episode 3 will be awarded with one of the most powerful and moving series they'll likely to have ever watched.\\n\\n\r\nJust like the Mona Lisa, Tale of Memories isn't for everyone. It is not light hearted, it is not a romantic comedy, but it is a work of art. While the series is easy to be ignored on first glance, the closer you look, the more impressed you will be.",

            "content": "When I was recommended ef - a tale of memories, I was not expecting much since it looked like another romance/drama show, and in the end it was, but it was not just like any other series out there...this one felt a little unique in its own way. Mostly because of how everything was delievered.\r\nStory: This anime is mainly divided by two main stories happening simultaneously. Most of the episodes would focus half of its airtime to one story and they switch to the other one. IMO this didnt bother me but it does kill some momentum if there is something important going on. Thisstory is really powerful and has some really shocking, sad and happy moments as well. I'll be honest and say that I favoured Hirono's story more than Renji's even if Renji's was filled with more tragedy while Hirono's had more drama, and that I also didnt really get into this story until after ep 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I mentioned episode 7 because the last minutes of that episode have been one of the most breathtaking, unique, and even scary moments I've seen in any anime...the way the 99 messages where displayed was REALLY powerful and it would leave anyone with their jaws open. Now that I've mentioned that I can say that I'm giving this score to the art but not because of character animation but because of the scenery and the backgrounds. Also this show felt like watching an abstract piece of art in a way, with the way they would invert the backgrounds or even deliver some of the content, an example would be having 3 different ED songs and it would change between the 3 almost every episode, same goes with showed the OP for the first time AFTER then end of ep 2, and ep 12 when the OP was indeed changed with the JAPANESE version of the song...this is IMO the show's best feature.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I dont have much to say about the sound, other than they really made a great job on using the correct sounds at the correct moments. So in the end this score is mostly about not how good it is but how good it was used\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I never really got attached to any character in the show but every character was really well developed along the conflicts and their reactions seemed to fit their looks perfectly. Chihiro was IMO the best developed character in this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I dont have much to say, this show was really good and i found it quite unique.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is one of the better drama/romance shows out there and should definitely give it a try since I'm sure you will get amazed at the way this show delivers It's story.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ef: A Tale of Memories (or rather, the ef series altogether) is what I consider one of the best romance anime out there. It\u2019s not the clich\u00e9 high school types with hesitant characters. Memories is far greater than any of those from its amazing artwork and unique cast. The characters are blunt and do not beat around the bush to slow down any development. The romance is not rushed, and the anime takes its time showing the memories the characters\u2019 create together.\r\nMemories has two separate stories. It focuses on the development of characters\u2019 relationships while delivering the fantasy/supernatural aspects (e.g. Chihiro\u2019s memory loss). The characters\u2019meetings are distinct and unexpected, and it becomes valuable throughout the anime. They all create both good and bad memories together to only become attached and inseparable. The story presents everything from all of the characters\u2019 point of views to show how much they care for the other or the struggles of their daily lives. Each character has a dream and works to fulfill it as their significant other shows support. My only beef with Memories is that it is unbearably dramatic in some cases where it appears as a Shakespeare play than an anime with the characters\u2019 excessive body movement during confrontations. \\n\\n\r\nThe best part about this anime is the characters\u2019 bluntness. There\u2019s no beating around the bush or annoying hesitancy from their speech. It keeps the drama moving with no unnecessary pauses of anxiety from the characters. Their honesty and monologue throughout the series reveal their hidden emotions and vast personalities. Supporting characters contribute to their relationships and offer advice or even a shoulder during tough times. It also adds to the comedy, seriousness, and uniqueness of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe Japanese seiyuu suited the characters\u2019 personalities and emotions at appropriate times. The voices are so strong and compatible with the characters that you can grasp and feel the character's emotions. The music and sound effects are remarkable. Violin music and the rest of the background music fit the atmosphere and situations perfectly. Sound effects support the drama with echoes and repetition, such as a phone\u2019s busy tone. \\n\\n\r\nThe art itself places Memories separately from other shows. The anime moves back and forth with the different color contrasts, transparency, floating words, illumination of the characters\u2019 outline, silhouettes, all sorts of angles on the characters\u2019 faces, etc. within a few seconds. It goes back and forth, and nothing is stable. It can either be so distracting or just appealing. The character design was good and distinguished the characters. The backgrounds are beautifully drawn. The animation had its moments where it was like an on-and-off switch. For example, one moment you can see movement in the ocean ripples, and the next moment it\u2019s still. Regardless, the artwork and animation fits the characters\u2019 artistic vision and reflects on the emotions presented in Memories.\\n\\n\r\nEf: A Tale of Memories is a must-watch for anyone who is into romance and tired of the clich\u00e9 show with indecisive characters, which is why it is one of my favorites. It\u2019s full of surprises and it does not annoyingly include na\u00efve characters that show down the progression of a relationship. The art and animation is unique and fit the anime perfectly. It's indeed a very heartwarming and charming anime.",

            "content": "I recently watched this series after I saw some recommendations about it when surfing the Kimi ga Nozomu eien page. Did it live up to my expectations ?  Well, let's see....\r\nStory\r\nFirst off, please don&rsquo;t let the first episode turn you away especially if you never looked at summaries or played the games. I admit that I was confused after watching the first episode.  After the first 3 episodes, it should be smooth. \r\nAside from this, the story is excellent. For a 12 episodes anime, the character development is great. By the end, you pretty much know all of the main characters, their pastand why they act in such a way. \\n\r\nThe ending is satisfactory although it leaves plenty of intrigue for another season to happen. Also, it certainly has a great replay value.\\n\r\nLots of things will make a lot more sense when I re-watch it. For example, the way some scenes were edited, the texts and words that come before some scenes and even during the opening songs, the different ending songs all have significance. I still haven&rsquo;t figured out everything since it was my first viewing but it will be fun to re-watch with another perspective.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nPicture perfect. The characters are well drawn and mostly colourful. The places and backgrounds feel real.\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\\n\r\nThe music fits the series well. From the prologue to opening song, the multiple ending songs and  the dramatic moments.. It really adds to the story. Great soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nLike I previously said, the character development for such a short series is tremendous. You really feel like you know the main characters by the end. They made sure to show some flashes of their past throughout the series so you can get a better understanding of the way they&rsquo;re acting. They all had some kind of trauma in their past that prevents them from doing something or making the right choices. \\n\r\nI would have loved to see more from some of the supporting characters like Yu and Yuko. Even if they were not well developed, you get a feel that there&rsquo;s more to them than meets the eye. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series and I&rsquo;m definitely going to re-watch it . If you like a short series that has some drama , romance, great characters , excellent music and great art, this is for you!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nI gave it a eight.  For most parts, it lived to my expectations. However, the thing that prevents me from giving it a higher mark was because I just felt it peaked at episode 11. The ending was good but I found myself on the edge of my seat at episode 11  not so much at episode 12. Aside from that, great series and I&rsquo;ll be waiting for another season.\\n",

There were many blanks at my mind and manythings i just could not understand. Remember that this is not a romance story like others and this can be revealed even from the first episode. As i said i wasnt very attracted by the first episode and so will you. But as the episodes were reaching at the end and as the plot was continuing i stuck at it before i could understand it. It's not just a romance story but also a social modern fairytale which passes many messages to whoever watch this.\\n\r\nImagine how good and weird (in a good way) the story was that i score it with a 10/10 even if im not a romance or drama lover....\\n\r\nThe hint of this anime's  success is the fact that the story isnt limited at only one couple of people but much more that take place at the same time...\\n\r\nIts just gorgeous...\\n\r\nI dont like speaking of the end of an anime so i just want you to trust me and discover it by your own.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (9)\\n\\n\r\nThe effects are very carefully chosen and some of them are of high importance for the plot.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter  (10)\\n\\n\r\nAs i said the story could be described as a social modern fairytale. Each of the characters has its magic and way of thinking which may be wrong and right at the same time.\\n\r\nThe protagonists can become from likeable, unlikeable and the opposite.\\n\r\nJust astonishing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nI went through  all the possible ways of experiencing happiness and distress, empathy and dislike so yes i enjoyed myself very very much.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9)\\n\\n\\n\r\nIts not easy for me to score a 10 overall at an anime.\\n\r\nEven when im not a romance lover...\\n\r\nBut remember that this one made me write all these imformation to make you watch it...\\n\r\nSo its a (9)\\n\\n\r\nTo all \"helpfull\" but also \"not helpfull\" votes i hope i didnt make you feel tired and of course i made you give this anime a try... And remember!! \\n\\n\r\nAs the year today comes to its end...\\n\\n\r\n\" Put your wishes into the memories you do not want to forget..\"\\n\r\n~ And make them look, like a modern messed up fairytale. ~\\n\r\n\" Make them look like your own tale of moments, your own tale of memories\"\\n\\n\r\nHappy 2015 to everyone :D",

            "content": "Are people merely a collection of their memories, or is a personality innately part of one's self? Ef: A Tale of Memories attempts to explore interesting questions like these, and while its heart is often in the right place, its execution ends up being problematic for numerous reasons.\r\nEf could really be thought of as two tales combined into one, as it follows two different sets of protagonists in their struggles to overcome their life problems. Hirono, an unmotivated high school student and fledgling manga artist, often has to have his longtime best friend Kei pick up the slack for him and make sure he keepsup with his education. One day however, Hirono encounters a girl named Miyako who frequently attempts to drag him away from his studies, which not only angers Kei for distracting him, but also starts to fuel her jealousy, as Miyako and Hirono increasingly become more attached to each other over time. The other tale focuses on Kei's sister Chihiro, who had suffered from a serious accident early in her life causing her to only retain the last 13 hours of her memory along with the memories she had prior to the accident. As a result, she continually has to relive the pain and realization that she will no longer be able to accumulate memories for the rest of her life. Through a chance meeting with a boy named Renji however, she is presented with a glimmer of hope that the remainder of her existence may not be so miserable as predicted. And that more or less sets the stage for the majority of the plot to come.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the idea of having two different plotlines essentially running parallel to each other with a completely different cast of characters placed in each thread. It's an interesting way of presenting the narrative that is rarely explored in anime or most any medium for that matter. Unfortunately though, it missed a huge opportunity to explore this concept to its fullest potential by eventually having the two plotlines intersect, which would open up interesting possibilities for the two sets of characters to share insights with each other. For example, Renji struggles with his future not knowing what he wants to do with his life. In contrast, Hirono is already living out his passions as a manga artist. Having the two characters eventually cross paths would have allowed Hirono to offer up some advice for Renji in helping him discover his passion, and likewise Renji--being the more sensitive-minded protagonist of the series--could have helped Hirono understand Kei's feelings better, but none of these possibilities are ever explored. Instead, we are only given a handful of situations where Kei and Chihiro occasionally exchange text messages on their cell phones. Consequently, this leaves the whole dual-plotline aspect of the narrative feeling mostly superfluous, and it just left me wondering why they didn't simply tell the two stories as completely separate anime. Since there was so little attempt at linking the two plotlines together, there wasn't much point in presenting them together when they have no real impact on each other. It merely breaks up the flow of the story unnecessarily. This problem is especially exemplified in the first episode. Because it has to spend time setting the stage for two sets of main characters instead of one, the introductory episode just ends up feeling like a series of jumbled random events that fail to hook you into the story and don't even find enough time to establish that Chihiro has a disability yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe problems worsen for the series when we examine Hirono's story arc, which mostly rehashes typical love triangle tropes and doesn't do anything particularly interesting with them. Further adding insult to injury, neither of Hirono's love interests are very likeable characters, nor is Hirono himself for that matter. Miyako mostly comes off as selfish and clingy, with very few if any redeeming qualities at all. She has no real hobbies or personal interests that make her unique, and she shows no genuine concern for Hirono and his problems beyond any that pertain to herself, which really makes me wonder why Hirono finds any interest in her at all. Kei is at least a slightly more palatable character, being that she has a talent for basketball and she makes an effort to look out for Hirono, but when her jealous side starts to kick in, she can be almost as cruel and selfish as Miyako. On top of all this, Hirono is painfully bad at recognizing Kei's feelings, and his inconsiderateness similarly makes him unlikeable. The one good aspect to this story arc however was the revelation that Kei had where she realized that she waited far too long to express her true feelings for Hirono. It's something that I could relate to in my own life and it is well-handled in that it shows how people continually delay saying things that need to be said thinking that there will always be a more appropriate time in the future to do so, but in reality that ideal future will never come and there is no better time than the present. All things considered though, this story arc was mostly underwhelming in its execution.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully Chihiro's story is significantly more worthwhile, offering up more relatable characters and a satisfying conclusion, along with its much more in-depth exploration of the anime's key theme: memories. Watching Chihiro struggle with her memory problems was heart-wrenching and engaging, and Renji, unlike Hirono, actually gives a damn about the things he does and the people he affects; making the characters on this side of the plot a hell of a lot more sympathetic.\\n\\n\r\nEven in spite of Chihiro's tale offering a better story though, both sides of the plot suffer from still more narrative problems. Very little actually happens from episode-to-episode, with many of the characters often trailing off into long bouts of small talk, monologues, and introspections that aren't particularly enthralling or justifiable in wasting your time, and considering that this anime is only 12 episodes long as it is, there really shouldn't be any excuse for such slow pacing. These tedious moments are often further exacerbated by the animation, which seems like it's trying to pass itself off as being \"artsy\" with experimental abstract techniques, but what it's really doing is just allowing the animators to be lazy and take a break. For instance, at one point in the plot Miyako has an emotional breakdown on the phone when she realizes she can't reach Hirono, so she proceeds to leave a very long series of messages repeatedly begging him to answer. Not only is the dialogue lengthy and monotonous here, but it's all set to an entirely static backdrop with nothing else but text appearing on-screen. We never actually get to see Miyako's facial expressions the whole time, which would have added much more dramatic effect, aside from being more interesting in general than having us stare at a static background for an uncomfortably prolonged period of time. As for the art and animation overall, it seems merely passable when it's doing its job and feels like it's trying to take shortcuts when it ventures into the experimental like the example above. The color palette has a sort of \"washed out\" effect to it which creates a melancholic atmosphere that was likely done as a stylistic choice to differentiate the anime, but as an unintended side effect it makes the visuals look more dated than they actually are.\\n\\n\r\nAs I have only seen the dub, I cannot make a comparison between the two audio tracks, but I will give a brief overview on the quality of the voice acting. If you're a frequent dub watcher, you'll probably recognize that most of the voice cast from Clannad is present in this series, with experienced actresses like Brittney Karbowski as Kei, Monica Rial as Chihiro, and Luci Christian as Miyako. On the whole though, the quality of the dub doesn't quite stack up to Clannad's; in part because Greg Ayres feels miscast as Hirono, who sounds less mature than he looks as a result. Monica Rial also tends to be cast in a lot of moe roles when her voice is far from moe, and unfortunately this is another one of those cases. She is a talented actress, but much like Greg Ayres, she is frequently misused. Regardless, even if Ef had a better dub, it would have done little to alleviate the bigger problems with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEf: A Tale of Memories attempts to explore many interesting and relatable themes dealing with love, jealousy, memories, and loneliness. Though sometimes it succeeds, the pointless use of dual plotlines and the often uneventful pacing take a severe toll on the narrative, aside from Hirono's story arc being mostly disappointing to begin with. I can only recommend this series to enthusiasts of the genre, as Chihiro's tale may be just enough to satisfy, but for a more casual romance viewer like myself, it's difficult to justify the time spent.",

            "content": "ef - a tale of memories is another brilliant work produced by Shaft, responsible for Negima!?, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, and Hidamari Sketch. Based on the visual novel of the same name, ef is split into two different storylines told simultaneously across 12 episodes. As it being a romance story, you can expect many cliches, but this is definitely one of those anime that molds all of that into a brilliant plot.\r\nStory: The plot is split between two stories, both told simultaneously throughout the show. It follows through different scenes of melodrama, emotional distress, and many touching scenes. The plot is slightly slow for the firsttwo or three episodes but picks up to an amazing finale.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Shaft's presence is definitely noted in this show as well as their other works. The art designs are actually not at all that great but due to Shaft and their experimental style, it generates a beautiful environment and colorful characters. The colors are vibrant and ever changing, fitting in with the flow of mood changes throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music in this show is simply outstanding. The music is produced by Tenmon, also responsible for the music in Makoto Shinkai's movies (5 Centimeters per Second, etc). The music fits perfectly with the scene and changes at a dime's notice for even more well executed dramatic effect. The soundtrack is definitely one to be picked up.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters here are full of personality. At times you can feel you can connect to them in different ways and at other times, you'd might even hate them. The characters are not exactly the most original created, but they definitely fulfill their roles in an amazing way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: I am personally not a big fan of serious romance drama so I gave it an 8 for Enjoyment. Even so, the story and style was extremely done well. The show just completely oozes of romance and it certainly delivers. A definite choice for a romance drama for those in search for one.",

            "content": "I'm not quite sure how I should write this. More or less, this series had the potential to be either a grand slam or a game ending triple play. In fact, the first time I watched it I thought it was pretty bad. I dropped it after watching half of the second episode. However, I picked it back up on a whim and boy was I surprised. This epic drama is probably the perfection of Greek drama on top of the romantic expectations in this day and age. But here is a warning, ef - a tale of memories demands more of the viewer thanthe average drama does.\\n\\n\r\nIn most dramas, you can predict a lot of the things happening. There will be \"X\" love triangle, there will be \"Y\" incident, etc. In a sense, one of the two stores in ef -a tale of memories does that (the one reloving around Hirono). However, it is the other strand (the one revolving around Renji and Chihiro) that makes this drama. The complexity of their story will probably move you to tears (or close enough). Though it is an extraordinary situation, it hits home hard. Without Renji and Chihiro's quest, I doubt this anime would be any different than the scores of romances and dramas out there. It was their relationship that had me glued to the computer screen watching all of ef - a tale of memories. Of course, saying any more would reveal this wonderful plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe story line was great. Though it is confusing to start, once the story begins to reveal itself, it absorbs you and you want more and more of it. Some of it is predictable, some of it is a surprise, and some of it is predictable but still delivers the same blow as a surprise turn in the plot would.\\n\\n\r\nThe character art could leave a bit to be desired but overall, the creators used color transitions, black/white, different drawing styles, color overlays, etc. in a beautiful manner. I couldn't really ask more from a show than this.\\n\\n\r\nNow the soundtrack wasn't the greatest in the world. It wasn't bad, it was good, but I felt that it had its ups and downs. There were times when it was right on cue and enhanced the scene. There were times when I thought that it worked but something different would have been much more effective.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all start a bit confusing but their development is fun to watch and it is their development that enhances the story. They aren't a bunch of static or stereotypical characters. Each one fits his or her role perfectly and work amazingly with the plot.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed ef - a tale of memories a lot. In fact, it is probably one of the best dramas I have ever seen. So I think its worth a try whether you are interested in this genre or were just looking for something to watch.",

            "content": "ef: A Tale of Memories. An anime that I had never heard of yet somehow made its way into my list.\r\nIn my abruptly deceased quest to find a show that could move me, I stumbled upon this gem. It was a coincidence really, I can't remember clearly but there it was, in the MAL top user recommendations for a certain drama anime that I enjoyed. \r\nSo I got curious, checked out the synopsis and art. Looked good. Checked some scores and they were even better. What could possibly go wrong?\r\nWell, everything did.\r\nNow with the uninteresting prologue finished, I'll move on to the actual review.\r\nWe areintroduced to a fairly small cast of characters, split into two different and simultaneous story arcs that never connect between each other despite having characters of the same family in both. \\n\\n\r\nThe first arc, is about a love triangle between a manga artist, her newly found obsessed girl who is all over him, and a childhood friend. The second one is about a girl with a condition that prevents her from remembering anything at all for longer than 24 hours, and how she meets a guy named Mr. Plainy Plainster. There are a few other support characters who have a story of their own I guess... none of them are worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the first arc, it's your overused love triangle. No, there are no special twists. The male main character is as plain as you can be, with his only defining trait being his talent for manga drawing. He lives in the house of a female childhood friend (who is sister of the girl with memory problems in the second arc) that is also in high school. He then meets an apparently popular and perfect-on-the-surface female, and chaos ensues. \\n\\n\r\nAnd if you thought there were few characters in the first arc, allow me to introduce you to the second one. Two characters total. The girl that can't remember things for longer than 24 hours, and a male lead that makes Kirito from SAO look like an interesting man full of virtue.\\n\\n\r\nThe story (or, stories) had some potential, but sadly always failed to be anything more than a laughable attempt to be deep or metaphorical. It would be less embarrassing if a mediocre show didn't try so hard to be something it's not. What I'm trying to say is, that this was made by SHAFT, so expect flamboyant and unnecessary animation. The artsy environments and overused symbolism are present everywhere, and they can be amazing additions to amazing shows, however they can also be a double edged sword if the content it tries to enhance simply fails to meet any expectation. This was the case with ef: a Tale of Memories.\\n\\n\r\nSo little happens in the actual anime that trying to delve deeper into the story arcs would probably spoil the minimal plot points that ef has to offer, so I won't do that. Just know that this anime was based off an eroge, so needless and random sex themes are around just enough to break any possible immersion. Oh, I forgot that supernatural themes are also present for no damn reason too!\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, the only things that you'll find in ef are: the worst kind of melodrama, unnecessary fanservice and suggestive themes, pointless supernatural elements, hilarious attempts to make this disappointing anime seem deep (through different means), and a very diverse cast of boring, bland and whiny characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDetailed analysis below:\\n\\n\r\nGeneral: \\n\r\n-Atmosphere 2/10 --- This is a lackluster tale about teenager love. The repetitive 'cute' backgrounds and symbolism are simply out of place.\\n\r\n-Characters  1/10 --- Completely unlikable cast of characters. I couldn't feel ANYTHING at all for any of them.\\n\r\n-Story development & ending 2/10 --- I laughed at the ending. And I don't have a heart of stone or anything, like I said at the beginning I started this because I wanted it to toy with my emotions, and the only thing it did was to toy with my laughter. Unexpected results.\\n\\n\r\nTechnical:\\n\r\nArt 7/10 --- The actual animation is nice when it isn't trying to be 2deep4me\\n\r\nSoundtrack -/10 --- I actually didn't pay any attention to the sound. And the version I watched lacked any opening sequence so I won't comment on this aspect.\\n\r\nVoice acting 3/10 --- Whoever did Chihiro, aka the girl with defective memory, needs to quit voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal:\\n\r\nPriority (How eager I was to watch the next episode) 4/10 --- To be honest I was expecting for something to happen...\\n\r\nMemorability 7/10 --- I'll never forget the worst show I blindly ventured myself into.\\n\\n\r\nFinal score:\\n\r\n2/10 --- Horrible\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend this piece of anime to anyone...  maybe to some enemies? It was the first and last time that I actually take MAL's user recommendations seriously. \\n\\n\r\nThe themes in here can be quite inappropriate even though this show seems like an innocent tale about teen romance. Out of place scenes and dialogues that do not fit with some of the characters' traits are included just to be faithful to the source material, I suppose, which added to the overall hilarity. Not recommended for 14 y/o or younger. \\n\\n\r\nThere's also a second season or rather, a spin-off called ef: a Tale of Melodies. Based on the minor characters of this one. Needless to say I didn't bother to watch it, nor will I ever do it.\\n\\n\r\nThis has been my second review, which was more in the verge of becoming a rant, but it had to be said. Don't watch this.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I was inspired to write this view to provide an alternative viewpoint on this good, but not great, show.\r\nStory - 4:\r\nThe story suffers from trying to cover too much. By covering six main characters, the show dilutes the huge potential it had. In the first half of the series, the story abruptly jumps from character to character requiring jarring adjustments of the mindset of the viewer. Although it is possible to jump between situations and tell a good story, it is a difficult task that ef has failed to meet. I believe that, given more time to develop context and maintain fluidity, this show couldhave been a perfect ten.\\n\\n\r\nOf the two main stories told, the relationship between Chihiro and Renji is the most enthralling. The emotional struggle over the value of memories, while a familiar topic, is presented in a invigorating way through romance. The exploration of the concepts of memory and its part in defining identity give ef weight that could easily cause one to reflect on their own life.\\n\\n\r\nHiro's story, by contrast, is a massive letdown. He is confronted, oddly and without warning, with a choice between two girls. Kei's situation is common in anime, but left underdeveloped by ef, causing it to be forgettable. On the other hand, Miyako's character is refreshing, but an emotional connection to her is sabotaged by gross underdevelopment. Overall, ef is fortunate that Chihiro's story overshadows this one, because this part of the story is utterly unremarkable.\\n\\n\r\nThe positive reaction received by this show makes you wonder what it could have accomplished if it had decided to tell a single coherent story.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9:\\n\r\nMy weakness in understanding of technical side of anime, I thoroughly enjoyed the artwork here. Every scene felt natural to me, lacking clutter or voids. I particularly noticed colors doing an excellent job of supporting the mood at any given moment. Various effects used during the show (static in the library comes to mind) were overused without explanation, but besides that, the abstract presentation used at times did wonders for setting the theme of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8:\\n\r\nI don't have much to comment on. The music never detracted from events, but it never managed to push emotionally when it could have. Outside of the show, the OP was excellent, but I never saw the ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10:\\n\r\nI feel that the characters are what truly shine in ef. The cast as a whole is struggling between their pasts and their future dreams. Despite the disappointing amount of time available to explore the characters, many of them seem to have truly developed over the course of the show. As implied in the description of the story, Chihiro and Renji shine as the most interesting and endearing characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6:\\n\r\nAlthough I did enjoy ef, my experience was hampered by the erratic story telling and the unexplained random text and scenes used to fill the screen (and this is coming from someone who thinks the original ending to NGE, while not pretty, was excellent). The potential for great enjoyment here is lost do to the schizophrenic pacing not allowing the viewer to settle into the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7:\\n\r\nef - a tale of memories is a good, even if overrated, show. The show suffers heavily from an underdeveloped half of the story (that of course being on Hiro's side). While the half of show focused on Chihiro and Renji was a masterpiece in my eyes, the contrived nature of the drama and romance surrounding Hiro knocked the shows feet from under it.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a must watch for serious fans of drama and romance, but casual visitors to the genre will be much better served by finding a more lighthearted show or something easier to follow such as Clannad (specifically after story, of course).\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Please note that this review was written within a day of completing the series. I worry that my views may be colored by having, in the past few weeks, completed two shows that have become my favorite drama  and my favorite romantic comedy. I will likely rewatch the show and revisit this review later this year and update to reflect such a possibility.)",

            "content": "I loved this anime very much.  It is extremely emotional and very well written.  First of all, this was NOT a typical romance/love triangle anime.  \r\nStory:\r\nThe story is very well thought out.  It can be confusing at times, but is quickly cleared up.  It is full of surprises, morals and everything a fan of anime would love to see.  Its split into two parts with two stories following extraordinary events (damn, sometimes i wish i was him.) and is set in the same place.  I believe that the time of the stories were different, however, it is plainto see if you watch this series which i highly recommend.  Despite the switching between the two &quot;stories&quot;, it flowed extremely well with each other.  A climatic event may be coming up soon, but it suddenly switches.  This was perhaps, the only flaw that i found in the story.  To me, this bother was so miniscule that it didn't impact my viewing experience in anyway.  Hirono, the manga artist, had an awkward love triangle story going on, which brought frustration.  Despite this, it is highly amusing and intriguing to watch.  Renji's story was different; it brought depression and sadness.  Metaphors are used EXTREMELY effectively in this story.  Together, the series is overflowing with human-problems that it seems like it will be difficult to conclude the series in an effective way.  This was quite the opposite.  Through the drama, frustration, sadness, romance and jealous, the story concluded shockingly well.  One of the best I've seen.  Many shows try to incorporate many different themes, but have failed.  This is one that succeeded.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful.  The scenery (sunsets, beaches, etc) was gorgeous.  The desperation shown by one of the characters was amazingly portrayed.  The last few minutes of that episode was so nervewracking (in a good way) and was shown with a fading screen.  Very powerful.  The opening scenes during the theme songs were very colorful and bright.  It was very pleasing to the eye.  The characters were also very well designed and colored.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound?  I guess i could say the sounds were used effectively.  When doors slam shut, all you here is the slamming; there is no useless background noise.  Also, to emphasize the sounds, the screen fades to black so you can focus.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe character development was very good.  I fell in love with many of the characters, but that is just me.  Piece by piece the information concerning each of the characters comes.  By the end, you will know everything about each of the characters.  Development was great, we knew what we needed to know about the characters in order understand what was going on and why it was occuring at that specific time.  Each of the characters were unique, there was no character that acted the same way another character did.  Chihiro was my favorite character because her past seems so clouded and mysterious, i got hooked.  Her 13 hour amnesia makes room for a hugeee character development.  There are so many things that could result of this one small detail.  Also, the art of the characters are very good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAh, how do i describe this.  You are presented with morals and things you can do in reality to make your life better.  Never give up, follow your dreams, yeah yeah sounds repetitive.  Wrong.  Instead of mindless nonsense, characters state their respective problems, then pursue them to correct them.  I enjoyed the series very much also because of the story.  It never lost my interest.  It is one-of-a-kind.  How often do you watch a accident-victim who can only remember 13 hours of memories?\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAs previously stated, it is very unique, effectively incorporates romance, sadness, happiness, frustration, jealous and morals.  The art was amazing, story was topnotch, characters were lovable and most importantly, the ending was so well done, i don't think i've watched any anime that concluded such a perplexing storyline so well in 12 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nBeing able to watch how a character reacts in a love triangle can be very informative, and funny at the same time.  This is one of the best drama/romance/slice-of-life shows i have ever seen, so i highly recommend you watch it.  It sure is a tear-jerker and this is one i will not forget in 13 hours. ;)",

            "content": "\"Letting go of a bond that you have created will cause you the same pain as having your body torn apart.\"\r\nBonds and dreams- they are two of the things which connect human beings on a universal level. Humans are social creatures, they need bonds in order to keep on living, and they also need those bonds in order to strengthen their confidence in themselves when things do not seem to be going the way they wish them to go. Unfortunately, life works that way sometimes and as result, the bonds formed between lovers and even friends are at times necessary to remind us of whowe are and that which we wish to become. \\n\\n\r\n\"Ef- A tale of memories\", is an anime that showcases these ideas beautifully and in a way that is instantly relatable to the viewer who is watching it. These ideas are conveyed through the story, art, sound, and characters within the story.\\n\\n\r\nStory- The story of \"ef\" follows a group of individuals and their relationships with one another. However, the story is different then a lot of other anime's because of the way in which it is told. For example, while in most anime's it is not surprising to see multiple relationships viewed from different perspectives, I find myself hard-pressed to find another show where it is as nicely done as it was in \"ef\". However, much of why the story was good has to do with the overall presentation of the show, since without it, the story would not have been nearly as outstanding as it was.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Character development- Words cannot describe the importance of the art direction in \"ef\". It is the element which makes ef, well...ef. Interactions between characters take place in front of a backdrop that is constantly changing, seemingly reflecting the mental state of the characters as they interact, and often times the viewers thoughts as they are watching the scene. In addition, the incredible art direction seems to foster a deeper connection between the viewer and the characters within the story, a connection that is quite different then any other anime I have seen. The existential themes of the show are very much reflected in scenes where characters are left alone and given a chance to reveal their thoughts and feelings unabashedly- in such scenes, faces contort and change, and the color palettes of these scenes follow suit. It is truly an incredible thing to see. \\n\\n\r\nSound- The music in \"ef\", is just as effective in conveying the themes of the show as the art direction is. Music, like art, is an essential part of most peoples lives- much like dreams and bonds are- and the creators of ef did a great job in using this to their advantage, creating an almost unconscious connection between the show and viewers. For instance, in the real world there is a sound for every feeling, a music for every mood, and in ef these ideas are realized splendidly. To illustrate this, one need only look at scenes dealing with Chihiro and her dream world, since without the music that accompanied these scenes they would be nowhere near as effective, and let me tell you, anyone that has any emotional capacity whatsoever will know what I mean upon watching  these scenes. Voice actors are also incredible in this series, doing their part in making ef's presentation a thing to see.\\n\\n\r\nAll that being said, I enjoyed this show very much and I don't think I have had as much of a connection with an anime as I did with ef. But it must be noted that the show needs to be watched multiple times since if it is only watched once, viewers will lose many of the subtle nuances that make ef the show that it is. In conclusion I give \"ef- a tale of memories\", a 10, and while I do realize that I did not say to much about the actual story of the show, I must say that it is something that needs to be experienced rather than simply read about. So what exactly are you waiting for? Watch it, I guarantee you that you will not regret it.",

However, not all shows with those basic ingredients have done so. What made this show so special then?\r\nI guess the characters, and the way they were portrayed. They were all struggling... struggling with their dreams. What to do. Who to be with. That was portrayed in such a way that I completely fell into it, with my entire mind. It was as if I was standing next to them, having to watch them struggle through their dreams and loves...forcing me to cry, both in the good and bad times they were experiencing. Also, the animation and the way the scenes were made was really beautiful and enjoyable. It was something I've never seen before, and normally I'd probably say that it was weird, I guess. But with this show... it just fit in so perfectly. The ending of this show was also something that was enjoyable. When I started watching the show, I'd never think about the ending it had, and I'd definitely not like the idea of such an ending. However, after having watched it, I msut say that it was indeed the perfect way to sum it all up. It couldn't have been done more beautifully, not the slightest inch better.

            "content": "\u201cPut your wishes into the memories you do not want to forget\u2026\u201d\r\nEf \u2013 a tale of memories is one of those anime that will probably stay in your memory and will be used as a standard to compare with other similar series in the future. Why in the future? Because the entire series is so beautifully made that there is only a very small handful of shows that are worth comparing it to at present time. In fact, as far as animation quality and technique are concerned Ef \u2013 a tale of memories is one of a kind and will most likely remain sofor some time to come.\\n\\n\r\nThe unique animation style is first shown in the first OP. While colourful images and sceneries directly taken out from the anime itself often proved to be an effective foreshadowing device (and a good way to capture viewers attention), the exact opposite apparently also work! With a simple coloured background plus a bunch of text, and some occasional symbolic representation of certain character/event, the OP of Ef \u2013 a tale of memories can be quite addictive to watch. Aside from the OP, the anime itself is equally impressive (if not more impressive). Extremely high quality animation is just a standard for this show. What makes it truly unique are the camera angles used in difference scenes, or in some cases the very effective use of repetitive text on the screen. The former often give viewers a greater view of things and present some background of the setting, while the latter case, the simple words and phrases are enough to advance the plot and at the same time depicts the mental state of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nViewers will most likely find the beginning of Ef \u2013 a tale of memories hard to follow. This can be attributed to the introduction of most (if not all) of the primary casts in the first episode. However, it was necessary to introduce all the seemingly unrelated characters at once since the storyline focuses deeply on the various characters\u2019 developments. It should also be pointed out that a few of the secondary characters will actually become the main characters of the sequel, Ef \u2013 a tale of melodies. Thus becoming familiar with the sideline characters now will serve as a good foundation for the sequel. \\n\\n\r\nThere are two parallel plots occurring simultaneously. The first involve a simple love triangle between a guy and two girls (somewhat similar to True Tears for those who have seen it), personally I did not find this plot particularly well written. However, the second plot is what makes Ef \u2013 a tale of memories shine like a bright star among numerous other anime of the same genre (it is also where the title of the anime came from!). The concept of the second story was designed to move ones\u2019 heart. It was built around pity and sadness. It was written in a way such that viewers will unconsciously find the couple destined to be together, yet due to some circumstances, made it near impossible for them to stay together. Overall, the story and characters are there to evoke a mixed array of emotions from us, the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, the entire show is beautifully executed. This includes the music as well. From the BGM in the prelude episode to the OP to the BGM throughout the series to the ending, they all fulfill their purpose very nicely and matches perfectly with the particularly scene at that particularly moment. Personally, it was the amazing OP (plus stunning animation from the OP) that caught my attention to this series. The music are largely composed by Tenmon who happened to be the music composer of other great shows such as 5 Centimeters per Second, Voices of a Distant Star, The Place Promised in Our Early Days, et cetera. \\n\\n\r\nEf \u2013 a tale of memories is truly a great romance anime that all romance suckers should not miss. From unbelievably stunning animation to music to characters to story, there is hardly anything to complain about this show (aside from the lack of \u201cbig name\u201d seiyu which some people care about). On the whole, Ef \u2013 a tale of memories is, without a doubt, one of the top romance anime of the decade.",

            "content": "ef - A Tales of Memories is a Psychological, Romance, Drama that may seem like all the other romance anime based of a visual novel (dating sim), yet there is something special about this one.\r\nVideo Alternative\r\nThe first episode of the series may seem pretty confusing and hard to follow, as the viewer is dragged, from one situation to another. However once you&rsquo;ve grasped the concept, it quickly becomes clear that this series is made up of two separate, main stories. From then on the show becomes easy to follow and to enjoy, for its uniqueness. There are so many twists and turns that are ableto turn any anime cliche into a work of art.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great and very well defined, as they all developed in their own way, throughout the story. You will have some that are involved in a tangled web of romance, others with their own psychological issues and one in particular that is suffering from an illness (which I must say, has never been portrayed so well in a long time). These characters are then able to show a mixed array of emotions and in turn, makes us viewers feel a mixed array of emotions whilst watching them.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and music quality are one of the best points as it illustrates scenes in such a way that you&rsquo;ll forget this anime was based of a visual novel (dating sim). This is just another one of the few SHAFT works that boast superb and somewhat unique artistic animation style and quality. The music is pretty amazing in its own way, with some really catchy OP and ED themes and during the show itself; there&rsquo;s also a wide collection of piano and violin melodies.\\n\\n\r\nOverall ef- A Tales of Memories proved to be a truly captivating romance anime that excelled, far above expectations. Having to go up against the mighty titan that is &ldquo;Clannad&rdquo;, this short anime series proved to be a worthy opponent. It&rsquo;s a very enjoyable series to watch, as each episode brings forth an interesting development however some of these developments can make anyone feel slightly disturbed. But it's this that sets the anime series apart, from all else. If you have a soft spot for romance anime, then there is no chance you'll be disappointed with this work of art. \\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "ef - a tale of memories had everything to be just another harem show adapted from an eroge. The season also brought the incredibly antecipated Clannad, so many wouldn't have given this show a second thought. However, the way such a simple story was developed is different from any other eroge adaptation that has seen the light of day so far.\r\nThe story isn't that original if you think about it. Dependable girls that simply need the protagonist, a dose of drama here and there. You're certain you've seen it all before until there were twists you weren't expecting. Somehow, the distant story feels all themore reachable, that it doesn't seem like just another story anymore. The hurt, the love, the helplessness, it is easier to connect to them than you'd have thought, and although the pacing may be a bit fast, you'll be caught thinking &quot;Hey, if it were me, would I do diferently?&quot;\\n\\n\r\nThe art is unique. Some may question it, say that it ruins the atmosphere of drama and turns it into another &quot;SHAFT Freak Show&quot;. But that is not true. The colors are so vivid, it's like you're watching the emotions themselves. The facial expressions, the sky, the ocean. Everthing looks so bright and detailed, you wonder why no one thought about doing this before. Dark colors when the characters are down, shining colors when they're bursting with happiness. It's like a moving portrait. A work of ark.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in ef is essential. Due to the eccentric art, there are times you can feel the tension rising through the background sound and the work of the seiyuus. The sound is sublime and as touching as the story itself. It's unpredictable and touching, and completely fitting for every situation. Each girl has their own theme, which show their hopes and fears. Not to mention the theme of the anime, Euphoric Field; even though it may have Engrish lyrics like so many others, it's shows completely what the show is about: hope.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are more than they seem to be. What's most impressive about ef is how you can easily connect to the character's feelings. There are some flaws, yes, in the development. But the feelings are easy to connect and comprehend, the jealousy, the desperation, the love. The girls may be but princesses waiting for rescue, but their feelings can be dark and shadowed by real human flaws. And as each episode passes, you can see them grow, their emotions grow.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, ef had everything to be 'just another show'. But between the two main stories, you're caught wanting more. It succeeds where many others have failed, at some times, being more touching than the big hit Clannad. But don't let the fact that it's a small series trick you. Have an open mind and embrace the emotional wreck that is ef. There are funny moments? Sure, why not. It's like the calm before the storm, and they lighten up the mood, almost trying to not prepare you for the worst. But ef is a drama series, and at that, it succeeds. And between all other 'drama' shows this season, it is the number one.",

            "content": "I decided to watch this anime after watching some AMVs. I've always despised the art style of this anime (big heads, pentagonal faces and skinny characters don't really appeal me), but the animation was gorgeous, which motivated me.\r\nStory: 5.\r\nThe story doesn't pick up until episode 5. I almost dropped watching it because it's boring at first, but it does get better as it goes, and since it's actually a short anime, I recommend watching it all. This anime could be divided in three stories. Sadly, aside from Renji and Chihiro's part, the story is very poor. If you're looking for a more complex, mind blowingstory, I recomend not watching this. While I love drama and I respect the director's decision to stage it in a unique way, some of the most dramatic parts in this anime are laughable, Like when Chihiro falls at the beach and Renji reaches out for her, or when Renji breaks down in later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6.\\n\r\nHere I devide it in two, visual style and animation. For visual style: 3, animation: 9. As I said before, I'm not fond of deformed characters, with extremely huge heads (like Miyamura's), but it's not for me to state my personal preferences in this review. I really like how a lot of the scenes in this anime look like vectors moving, it was really original and it's what I like the most about this anime (the opening itself is a very good example of it).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10.\\n\r\nI have nothing to say here. It's really good from the very beginning to the very end. All songs are brilliant and it blends in magically. \"Euphoric Field\" is something you'll want to put in your iPod right away.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8.\\n\r\nFor a 12-episode anime, the characters develop pretty well, each following their own pace. Most notably are Kei and Chihiro. Miyako also changes a bit at the end, but overall, she's your tipical annoying, childish girl.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7.\\n\r\nThis anime has a very serious problem: you'll find youserlf glued to the screen at some point while watching it (episode 11 speaks for itself), but at other parts you'll just yawn and think about dropping watching it (like when Miyako calls Hiro in episode 7 and 10).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.\\n\r\nIt could've been better written, but it wasn't a waste of time watching it. I'm still in love with it's animation and vector-like style (can I call this 4 wall breakage? I really enjoy that. Google it if you don't know what it means). It's not an anime I'd recommend to others, but if people asked me if it's worth watching it or not, I'd simply say: It's good.",

            "content": "I almost dropped this anime, but since it only had 12 episodes, I kept watching. I'm not saying it's a crappy anime, but I didn't like it. And there are reasons. Lots of them.\r\nStory   \r\nThe story is pretty easy to follow, even though it's actually more like two stories and not just one. I don't see the idea of having two stories, though. Although they are somehow related, I really don't understand it. That put aside, the story is quite basic with a few things that make it different to your normal anime story, but if you don't think about these few things,it kind of seems like you have seen the anime before somewhere. The way I look at it, this story doesn't have a plot worth talking about. It just revolves around some teenagers with some problems, and that's about it. Of course the problems might be a little odd, but that doesn't make me rate it any better.\\n\r\nHowever, I did like the ending.\\n\\n\r\nArt   \\n\r\nThe background scenery and the drawings were very well made. There were a lot of colors, and the animation worked very good too. One thing I'm extremely dissatisfied with is the overuse of colors to describe how a person feels. Suddenly a person is drawn entirely in black and white, and on other ocassions the same person is drawn glowing red. I fully understand the use of this, but I just.. hate it. I think it makes it far too antirealistic (not that I hate antirealism, I just don't think it fits to this kind of anime). I also don't like the way some of the scenes function. Example: One of the main persons is talking to another main person. Suddenly the camera switches focus to the lips of that person (It's a girl, that's why), and then to somewhere completely else. A few second later there's another change in scenes, and it continues that way. I get the idea, but I think that changing scenes all the time is, well, annoying. It's not that you can't follow what's happening, it's just that I think it's more or less meaningless (especially when it's used all the time).\\n\r\nA lot of people might say that I simply don't understand real art. And that's true. I do not understand art. Period. I just want everything to be simple, yet useful. And that applies to everything in my world - not just anime. And by &quot;simple&quot;, I don't necessarily mean drawings without details. That would be a shame. I mean that there shouldn't be anything that's far out with no meaning in particular. That's what I think...\\n\\n\r\nSound   \\n\r\nThere's not really much to say about the sound. It works. I don't think it's bad, and I don't think it's amazing. It's just plain good. A thing that bothers me is, however, that this anime, like a lot of other animes, used some English lyrics. In my opinion, the English/Japanese mix wasn't good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter   \\n\r\nThe characters were (mostly) types I had seen before, but I honestly don't care about that. There were different personalities, some of them being complete contractions of one of the other characters, while some of them were more similar to each other. All of the characters were well thought up.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment   \\n\r\nAs stated earlier, I almost dropped this show. I did enjoy some parts of the anime, but then again, a lot of the time I was just bored. Because this wasn't a comedy, I thought I would have a nice time watching some drama, but I never really liked it. It missed an exciting plot that would've made me watch it with enjoyment. Sure, I did cry a little sometimes, but that's not uncommon for me.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\r\nIf you think your way of thinking is similar to how I think of thinking (hmm..), I wouldn't recommend this anime.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you like going to art museums or something like that (to me museums equal hell x 1000), there's a chance you'll like this.\\n\\n\r\nBut I didn't.",

Don't be mad because I didn't stopped writing my f*cked up reviews, I only do it for the fun, if you like them, thank you very much, if you hate them then you shouldn't read them at all, whaha! =D\r\nStory\r\nIf there is an anime with a good story, then it's Ef - A Tale Of Memories. I saw alot of 'drama' animes but I think Ef - A Tale Of Memories is the best so far. At the beginning, you won't understand the story, neither did I. But don't stop after the first episode, it's really gonna get much better andyou'll understand the situation! This is a story where you really could cry about.. If you like drama and romance you'll just gonna love this, wait and see.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe art of Ef - A Tale Of Memories is a very big pluspoint! This anime has a very unique art that's well made. In some scenes something changes, I don't really know how to explain this because I'm dutch, just watch it for yourself. But I never seen something like this before, like I said, it's just unique. Maybe I'll see this as the anime with the best art from 2007, maybe also the best story.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nIt's hard to say something about this. The songs are awesome, the sound is how it needs to be, and that's everything I can say. But I'm sure that the sound isn't the most important thing for watching a anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe characters of this anime are also unique. Each of them has their own story, something that I love. Miyako, Chihiro, Renji, Hiro and the rest are just awesome. BUT the character that I really hate is Kei, who does she think she is?! I'd seen alot of people who also hate her and I can understand, you also will if you watch it. I NEVER saw a character who is so selfish as Kei, I really can't stand the fact why she is in such a good anime. But she doesn't messes it up for me because I'm sure that she's gonna lose and I can't wait to see that! I love every character but just not Kei, you're my friend if you think the same, haha! =D\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nIf you want comedy, then you're at the wrong place. I don't think that this is supossed to be funny, even though every anime has their funny moments. But this is really a drama/romance, mostly drama I think, so if you're not a drama-type at all, don't watch this. I'd warn you! Back at the good part: If you LOVE drama then this is a MUST see anime! I really enjoy this with all my animeheart! =D Let's get our handkerchiefs ready for the rest of this anime!\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI couldn't help my myself.. I give it a 10! Some people will call me crazy because maybe they're not into drama, well get out of here! This is my review, muwhaha. All the people who want to watch this now: I wish you a great time watching this awesome anime! &lt;3\\n\\n\r\nReview writen by: Erisu\\n\\n",

The story is incredibly, mind-blowingly generic, and the characters are so typical that I feel like I've seen them in dozens of other shows. On top of that, the \"artistic\" style of the anime was so distracting and ridiculous. I found myself laughing every time the scene became obnoxiously distorted or the colors changed, because it was so non-discrete and it never quit. Yes, this anime is pretty. But it's pretty in a way that makes it clear that it's trying way too hard to be beautiful and artistic. All in all,this anime was painful to watch. It was not deep nor creative like it tried so hard to be.",

            "content": "Stumbling across Tale of Memories amongst the sea of eroge adaptations is akin to finding a piece of artwork rivaling the Mona Lisa in playboy. Something so rare that its likely to be met by skepticism by friends till they experience the most unlikely gem themselves.\r\nThe premise of Tale of Memories isn't exactly original. It details the story of two guys. One who helps a girl who can only remember events for 13 hours achieve her dream. The other who must get over his indecisive nature before his love triangle becomes  School days (i.e, deadly). But then, the Mona Lisa is just a pictureof some chick smiling. The devil is in the details, and Memories tells these stories so flawlessly that you'll likely experience the joy and despair that each character faces first hand.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of episode 7, for example involved a girl whose phone calls went unanswered for a day. While this likely gets a standard 2 minute treatment of a girl acting moe is any other anime, memories combines astounding voice acting with unprecedented symbolic visuals to form a portrayal of mental breakdown so powerful that it'll likely send Chuck Norris into a stunned stupor. Given that I have already given Clannad 10 for animation, memories deserves at least 11.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in Memories is astounding. While most anime are content to simply use animation to show what is happening on the screen, Memories goes several steps further, playing with everything from color saturation, transparencies, to background abstraction and non-standard cropping to convey powerful emotions in every scene.\\n\\n\r\nThis attention to detail permeates through all aspects of the series. The minor differences between episodes in the OP, the sudden scenes without color, everything has a purpose. Memories is one of those rare shows that deserves a immediate rewatch, for it is a joy to notice all the meaningful details you missed the first time round.\\n\\n\r\nMemories only weakness is that like any piece of serious art, it is not friendly towards casual viewers. The first episode, with its unique presentation, and multiple intertwining characters, is likely to confuse. However, anyone who watches past episode 3 will be awarded with one of the most powerful and moving series they'll likely to have ever watched.\\n\\n\r\nJust like the Mona Lisa, Tale of Memories isn't for everyone. It is not light hearted, it is not a romantic comedy, but it is a work of art. While the series is easy to be ignored on first glance, the closer you look, the more impressed you will be.",

            "content": "When I was recommended ef - a tale of memories, I was not expecting much since it looked like another romance/drama show, and in the end it was, but it was not just like any other series out there...this one felt a little unique in its own way. Mostly because of how everything was delievered.\r\nStory: This anime is mainly divided by two main stories happening simultaneously. Most of the episodes would focus half of its airtime to one story and they switch to the other one. IMO this didnt bother me but it does kill some momentum if there is something important going on. Thisstory is really powerful and has some really shocking, sad and happy moments as well. I'll be honest and say that I favoured Hirono's story more than Renji's even if Renji's was filled with more tragedy while Hirono's had more drama, and that I also didnt really get into this story until after ep 7.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I mentioned episode 7 because the last minutes of that episode have been one of the most breathtaking, unique, and even scary moments I've seen in any anime...the way the 99 messages where displayed was REALLY powerful and it would leave anyone with their jaws open. Now that I've mentioned that I can say that I'm giving this score to the art but not because of character animation but because of the scenery and the backgrounds. Also this show felt like watching an abstract piece of art in a way, with the way they would invert the backgrounds or even deliver some of the content, an example would be having 3 different ED songs and it would change between the 3 almost every episode, same goes with showed the OP for the first time AFTER then end of ep 2, and ep 12 when the OP was indeed changed with the JAPANESE version of the song...this is IMO the show's best feature.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I dont have much to say about the sound, other than they really made a great job on using the correct sounds at the correct moments. So in the end this score is mostly about not how good it is but how good it was used\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I never really got attached to any character in the show but every character was really well developed along the conflicts and their reactions seemed to fit their looks perfectly. Chihiro was IMO the best developed character in this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I dont have much to say, this show was really good and i found it quite unique.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is one of the better drama/romance shows out there and should definitely give it a try since I'm sure you will get amazed at the way this show delivers It's story.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ef: A Tale of Memories (or rather, the ef series altogether) is what I consider one of the best romance anime out there. It\u2019s not the clich\u00e9 high school types with hesitant characters. Memories is far greater than any of those from its amazing artwork and unique cast. The characters are blunt and do not beat around the bush to slow down any development. The romance is not rushed, and the anime takes its time showing the memories the characters\u2019 create together.\r\nMemories has two separate stories. It focuses on the development of characters\u2019 relationships while delivering the fantasy/supernatural aspects (e.g. Chihiro\u2019s memory loss). The characters\u2019meetings are distinct and unexpected, and it becomes valuable throughout the anime. They all create both good and bad memories together to only become attached and inseparable. The story presents everything from all of the characters\u2019 point of views to show how much they care for the other or the struggles of their daily lives. Each character has a dream and works to fulfill it as their significant other shows support. My only beef with Memories is that it is unbearably dramatic in some cases where it appears as a Shakespeare play than an anime with the characters\u2019 excessive body movement during confrontations. \\n\\n\r\nThe best part about this anime is the characters\u2019 bluntness. There\u2019s no beating around the bush or annoying hesitancy from their speech. It keeps the drama moving with no unnecessary pauses of anxiety from the characters. Their honesty and monologue throughout the series reveal their hidden emotions and vast personalities. Supporting characters contribute to their relationships and offer advice or even a shoulder during tough times. It also adds to the comedy, seriousness, and uniqueness of the cast.\\n\\n\r\nThe Japanese seiyuu suited the characters\u2019 personalities and emotions at appropriate times. The voices are so strong and compatible with the characters that you can grasp and feel the character's emotions. The music and sound effects are remarkable. Violin music and the rest of the background music fit the atmosphere and situations perfectly. Sound effects support the drama with echoes and repetition, such as a phone\u2019s busy tone. \\n\\n\r\nThe art itself places Memories separately from other shows. The anime moves back and forth with the different color contrasts, transparency, floating words, illumination of the characters\u2019 outline, silhouettes, all sorts of angles on the characters\u2019 faces, etc. within a few seconds. It goes back and forth, and nothing is stable. It can either be so distracting or just appealing. The character design was good and distinguished the characters. The backgrounds are beautifully drawn. The animation had its moments where it was like an on-and-off switch. For example, one moment you can see movement in the ocean ripples, and the next moment it\u2019s still. Regardless, the artwork and animation fits the characters\u2019 artistic vision and reflects on the emotions presented in Memories.\\n\\n\r\nEf: A Tale of Memories is a must-watch for anyone who is into romance and tired of the clich\u00e9 show with indecisive characters, which is why it is one of my favorites. It\u2019s full of surprises and it does not annoyingly include na\u00efve characters that show down the progression of a relationship. The art and animation is unique and fit the anime perfectly. It's indeed a very heartwarming and charming anime.",

Well, let's see....\r\nStory\r\nFirst off, please don&rsquo;t let the first episode turn you away especially if you never looked at summaries or played the games. I admit that I was confused after watching the first episode.  After the first 3 episodes, it should be smooth. \r\nAside from this, the story is excellent. For a 12 episodes anime, the character development is great. By the end, you pretty much know all of the main characters, their pastand why they act in such a way. \\n\r\nThe ending is satisfactory although it leaves plenty of intrigue for another season to happen. Also, it certainly has a great replay value.\\n\r\nLots of things will make a lot more sense when I re-watch it. For example, the way some scenes were edited, the texts and words that come before some scenes and even during the opening songs, the different ending songs all have significance. I still haven&rsquo;t figured out everything since it was my first viewing but it will be fun to re-watch with another perspective.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nPicture perfect. The characters are well drawn and mostly colourful. The places and backgrounds feel real.\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\\n\r\nThe music fits the series well. From the prologue to opening song, the multiple ending songs and  the dramatic moments.. It really adds to the story. Great soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nLike I previously said, the character development for such a short series is tremendous. You really feel like you know the main characters by the end. They made sure to show some flashes of their past throughout the series so you can get a better understanding of the way they&rsquo;re acting. They all had some kind of trauma in their past that prevents them from doing something or making the right choices. \\n\r\nI would have loved to see more from some of the supporting characters like Yu and Yuko. Even if they were not well developed, you get a feel that there&rsquo;s more to them than meets the eye. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series and I&rsquo;m definitely going to re-watch it . If you like a short series that has some drama , romance, great characters , excellent music and great art, this is for you!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nI gave it a eight.  For most parts, it lived to my expectations. However, the thing that prevents me from giving it a higher mark was because I just felt it peaked at episode 11. The ending was good but I found myself on the edge of my seat at episode 11  not so much at episode 12. Aside from that, great series and I&rsquo;ll be waiting for another season.\\n",

            "content": "ef : A tale of memories..\r\nThis is my first review of an anime or it would be better if i said the first time i though of writing one...\r\nI was attracted to start watching this anime only because of its overall but it seems to be far more fascinating than i expected it to be..\r\nLets go straight at my impressions as far as the story, the characters and the effects of this anime are concerned.\r\nStory (10)\r\nThe first episode, which i tried to watch with a friend but i never finished it, was very complicated for me. There were many blanks at my mind and manythings i just could not understand. Remember that this is not a romance story like others and this can be revealed even from the first episode. As i said i wasnt very attracted by the first episode and so will you. But as the episodes were reaching at the end and as the plot was continuing i stuck at it before i could understand it. It's not just a romance story but also a social modern fairytale which passes many messages to whoever watch this.\\n\r\nImagine how good and weird (in a good way) the story was that i score it with a 10/10 even if im not a romance or drama lover....\\n\r\nThe hint of this anime's  success is the fact that the story isnt limited at only one couple of people but much more that take place at the same time...\\n\r\nIts just gorgeous...\\n\r\nI dont like speaking of the end of an anime so i just want you to trust me and discover it by your own.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (9)\\n\\n\r\nThe effects are very carefully chosen and some of them are of high importance for the plot.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter  (10)\\n\\n\r\nAs i said the story could be described as a social modern fairytale. Each of the characters has its magic and way of thinking which may be wrong and right at the same time.\\n\r\nThe protagonists can become from likeable, unlikeable and the opposite.\\n\r\nJust astonishing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nI went through  all the possible ways of experiencing happiness and distress, empathy and dislike so yes i enjoyed myself very very much.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9)\\n\\n\\n\r\nIts not easy for me to score a 10 overall at an anime.\\n\r\nEven when im not a romance lover...\\n\r\nBut remember that this one made me write all these imformation to make you watch it...\\n\r\nSo its a (9)\\n\\n\r\nTo all \"helpfull\" but also \"not helpfull\" votes i hope i didnt make you feel tired and of course i made you give this anime a try... And remember!! \\n\\n\r\nAs the year today comes to its end...\\n\\n\r\n\" Put your wishes into the memories you do not want to forget..\"\\n\r\n~ And make them look, like a modern messed up fairytale. ~\\n\r\n\" Make them look like your own tale of moments, your own tale of memories\"\\n\\n\r\nHappy 2015 to everyone :D",

            "content": "Are people merely a collection of their memories, or is a personality innately part of one's self? Ef: A Tale of Memories attempts to explore interesting questions like these, and while its heart is often in the right place, its execution ends up being problematic for numerous reasons.\r\nEf could really be thought of as two tales combined into one, as it follows two different sets of protagonists in their struggles to overcome their life problems. Hirono, an unmotivated high school student and fledgling manga artist, often has to have his longtime best friend Kei pick up the slack for him and make sure he keepsup with his education. One day however, Hirono encounters a girl named Miyako who frequently attempts to drag him away from his studies, which not only angers Kei for distracting him, but also starts to fuel her jealousy, as Miyako and Hirono increasingly become more attached to each other over time. The other tale focuses on Kei's sister Chihiro, who had suffered from a serious accident early in her life causing her to only retain the last 13 hours of her memory along with the memories she had prior to the accident. As a result, she continually has to relive the pain and realization that she will no longer be able to accumulate memories for the rest of her life. Through a chance meeting with a boy named Renji however, she is presented with a glimmer of hope that the remainder of her existence may not be so miserable as predicted. And that more or less sets the stage for the majority of the plot to come.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the idea of having two different plotlines essentially running parallel to each other with a completely different cast of characters placed in each thread. It's an interesting way of presenting the narrative that is rarely explored in anime or most any medium for that matter. Unfortunately though, it missed a huge opportunity to explore this concept to its fullest potential by eventually having the two plotlines intersect, which would open up interesting possibilities for the two sets of characters to share insights with each other. For example, Renji struggles with his future not knowing what he wants to do with his life. In contrast, Hirono is already living out his passions as a manga artist. Having the two characters eventually cross paths would have allowed Hirono to offer up some advice for Renji in helping him discover his passion, and likewise Renji--being the more sensitive-minded protagonist of the series--could have helped Hirono understand Kei's feelings better, but none of these possibilities are ever explored. Instead, we are only given a handful of situations where Kei and Chihiro occasionally exchange text messages on their cell phones. Consequently, this leaves the whole dual-plotline aspect of the narrative feeling mostly superfluous, and it just left me wondering why they didn't simply tell the two stories as completely separate anime. Since there was so little attempt at linking the two plotlines together, there wasn't much point in presenting them together when they have no real impact on each other. It merely breaks up the flow of the story unnecessarily. This problem is especially exemplified in the first episode. Because it has to spend time setting the stage for two sets of main characters instead of one, the introductory episode just ends up feeling like a series of jumbled random events that fail to hook you into the story and don't even find enough time to establish that Chihiro has a disability yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe problems worsen for the series when we examine Hirono's story arc, which mostly rehashes typical love triangle tropes and doesn't do anything particularly interesting with them. Further adding insult to injury, neither of Hirono's love interests are very likeable characters, nor is Hirono himself for that matter. Miyako mostly comes off as selfish and clingy, with very few if any redeeming qualities at all. She has no real hobbies or personal interests that make her unique, and she shows no genuine concern for Hirono and his problems beyond any that pertain to herself, which really makes me wonder why Hirono finds any interest in her at all. Kei is at least a slightly more palatable character, being that she has a talent for basketball and she makes an effort to look out for Hirono, but when her jealous side starts to kick in, she can be almost as cruel and selfish as Miyako. On top of all this, Hirono is painfully bad at recognizing Kei's feelings, and his inconsiderateness similarly makes him unlikeable. The one good aspect to this story arc however was the revelation that Kei had where she realized that she waited far too long to express her true feelings for Hirono. It's something that I could relate to in my own life and it is well-handled in that it shows how people continually delay saying things that need to be said thinking that there will always be a more appropriate time in the future to do so, but in reality that ideal future will never come and there is no better time than the present. All things considered though, this story arc was mostly underwhelming in its execution.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully Chihiro's story is significantly more worthwhile, offering up more relatable characters and a satisfying conclusion, along with its much more in-depth exploration of the anime's key theme: memories. Watching Chihiro struggle with her memory problems was heart-wrenching and engaging, and Renji, unlike Hirono, actually gives a damn about the things he does and the people he affects; making the characters on this side of the plot a hell of a lot more sympathetic.\\n\\n\r\nEven in spite of Chihiro's tale offering a better story though, both sides of the plot suffer from still more narrative problems. Very little actually happens from episode-to-episode, with many of the characters often trailing off into long bouts of small talk, monologues, and introspections that aren't particularly enthralling or justifiable in wasting your time, and considering that this anime is only 12 episodes long as it is, there really shouldn't be any excuse for such slow pacing. These tedious moments are often further exacerbated by the animation, which seems like it's trying to pass itself off as being \"artsy\" with experimental abstract techniques, but what it's really doing is just allowing the animators to be lazy and take a break. For instance, at one point in the plot Miyako has an emotional breakdown on the phone when she realizes she can't reach Hirono, so she proceeds to leave a very long series of messages repeatedly begging him to answer. Not only is the dialogue lengthy and monotonous here, but it's all set to an entirely static backdrop with nothing else but text appearing on-screen. We never actually get to see Miyako's facial expressions the whole time, which would have added much more dramatic effect, aside from being more interesting in general than having us stare at a static background for an uncomfortably prolonged period of time. As for the art and animation overall, it seems merely passable when it's doing its job and feels like it's trying to take shortcuts when it ventures into the experimental like the example above. The color palette has a sort of \"washed out\" effect to it which creates a melancholic atmosphere that was likely done as a stylistic choice to differentiate the anime, but as an unintended side effect it makes the visuals look more dated than they actually are.\\n\\n\r\nAs I have only seen the dub, I cannot make a comparison between the two audio tracks, but I will give a brief overview on the quality of the voice acting. If you're a frequent dub watcher, you'll probably recognize that most of the voice cast from Clannad is present in this series, with experienced actresses like Brittney Karbowski as Kei, Monica Rial as Chihiro, and Luci Christian as Miyako. On the whole though, the quality of the dub doesn't quite stack up to Clannad's; in part because Greg Ayres feels miscast as Hirono, who sounds less mature than he looks as a result. Monica Rial also tends to be cast in a lot of moe roles when her voice is far from moe, and unfortunately this is another one of those cases. She is a talented actress, but much like Greg Ayres, she is frequently misused. Regardless, even if Ef had a better dub, it would have done little to alleviate the bigger problems with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEf: A Tale of Memories attempts to explore many interesting and relatable themes dealing with love, jealousy, memories, and loneliness. Though sometimes it succeeds, the pointless use of dual plotlines and the often uneventful pacing take a severe toll on the narrative, aside from Hirono's story arc being mostly disappointing to begin with. I can only recommend this series to enthusiasts of the genre, as Chihiro's tale may be just enough to satisfy, but for a more casual romance viewer like myself, it's difficult to justify the time spent.",

            "content": "ef - a tale of memories is another brilliant work produced by Shaft, responsible for Negima!?, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, and Hidamari Sketch. Based on the visual novel of the same name, ef is split into two different storylines told simultaneously across 12 episodes. As it being a romance story, you can expect many cliches, but this is definitely one of those anime that molds all of that into a brilliant plot.\r\nStory: The plot is split between two stories, both told simultaneously throughout the show. It follows through different scenes of melodrama, emotional distress, and many touching scenes. The plot is slightly slow for the firsttwo or three episodes but picks up to an amazing finale.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Shaft's presence is definitely noted in this show as well as their other works. The art designs are actually not at all that great but due to Shaft and their experimental style, it generates a beautiful environment and colorful characters. The colors are vibrant and ever changing, fitting in with the flow of mood changes throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music in this show is simply outstanding. The music is produced by Tenmon, also responsible for the music in Makoto Shinkai's movies (5 Centimeters per Second, etc). The music fits perfectly with the scene and changes at a dime's notice for even more well executed dramatic effect. The soundtrack is definitely one to be picked up.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The characters here are full of personality. At times you can feel you can connect to them in different ways and at other times, you'd might even hate them. The characters are not exactly the most original created, but they definitely fulfill their roles in an amazing way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: I am personally not a big fan of serious romance drama so I gave it an 8 for Enjoyment. Even so, the story and style was extremely done well. The show just completely oozes of romance and it certainly delivers. A definite choice for a romance drama for those in search for one.",

            "content": "I'm not quite sure how I should write this. More or less, this series had the potential to be either a grand slam or a game ending triple play. In fact, the first time I watched it I thought it was pretty bad. I dropped it after watching half of the second episode. However, I picked it back up on a whim and boy was I surprised. This epic drama is probably the perfection of Greek drama on top of the romantic expectations in this day and age. But here is a warning, ef - a tale of memories demands more of the viewer thanthe average drama does.\\n\\n\r\nIn most dramas, you can predict a lot of the things happening. There will be \"X\" love triangle, there will be \"Y\" incident, etc. In a sense, one of the two stores in ef -a tale of memories does that (the one reloving around Hirono). However, it is the other strand (the one revolving around Renji and Chihiro) that makes this drama. The complexity of their story will probably move you to tears (or close enough). Though it is an extraordinary situation, it hits home hard. Without Renji and Chihiro's quest, I doubt this anime would be any different than the scores of romances and dramas out there. It was their relationship that had me glued to the computer screen watching all of ef - a tale of memories. Of course, saying any more would reveal this wonderful plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe story line was great. Though it is confusing to start, once the story begins to reveal itself, it absorbs you and you want more and more of it. Some of it is predictable, some of it is a surprise, and some of it is predictable but still delivers the same blow as a surprise turn in the plot would.\\n\\n\r\nThe character art could leave a bit to be desired but overall, the creators used color transitions, black/white, different drawing styles, color overlays, etc. in a beautiful manner. I couldn't really ask more from a show than this.\\n\\n\r\nNow the soundtrack wasn't the greatest in the world. It wasn't bad, it was good, but I felt that it had its ups and downs. There were times when it was right on cue and enhanced the scene. There were times when I thought that it worked but something different would have been much more effective.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all start a bit confusing but their development is fun to watch and it is their development that enhances the story. They aren't a bunch of static or stereotypical characters. Each one fits his or her role perfectly and work amazingly with the plot.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed ef - a tale of memories a lot. In fact, it is probably one of the best dramas I have ever seen. So I think its worth a try whether you are interested in this genre or were just looking for something to watch.",

            "content": "ef: A Tale of Memories. An anime that I had never heard of yet somehow made its way into my list.\r\nIn my abruptly deceased quest to find a show that could move me, I stumbled upon this gem. It was a coincidence really, I can't remember clearly but there it was, in the MAL top user recommendations for a certain drama anime that I enjoyed. \r\nSo I got curious, checked out the synopsis and art. Looked good. Checked some scores and they were even better. What could possibly go wrong?\r\nWell, everything did.\r\nNow with the uninteresting prologue finished, I'll move on to the actual review.\r\nWe areintroduced to a fairly small cast of characters, split into two different and simultaneous story arcs that never connect between each other despite having characters of the same family in both. \\n\\n\r\nThe first arc, is about a love triangle between a manga artist, her newly found obsessed girl who is all over him, and a childhood friend. The second one is about a girl with a condition that prevents her from remembering anything at all for longer than 24 hours, and how she meets a guy named Mr. Plainy Plainster. There are a few other support characters who have a story of their own I guess... none of them are worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the first arc, it's your overused love triangle. No, there are no special twists. The male main character is as plain as you can be, with his only defining trait being his talent for manga drawing. He lives in the house of a female childhood friend (who is sister of the girl with memory problems in the second arc) that is also in high school. He then meets an apparently popular and perfect-on-the-surface female, and chaos ensues. \\n\\n\r\nAnd if you thought there were few characters in the first arc, allow me to introduce you to the second one. Two characters total. The girl that can't remember things for longer than 24 hours, and a male lead that makes Kirito from SAO look like an interesting man full of virtue.\\n\\n\r\nThe story (or, stories) had some potential, but sadly always failed to be anything more than a laughable attempt to be deep or metaphorical. It would be less embarrassing if a mediocre show didn't try so hard to be something it's not. What I'm trying to say is, that this was made by SHAFT, so expect flamboyant and unnecessary animation. The artsy environments and overused symbolism are present everywhere, and they can be amazing additions to amazing shows, however they can also be a double edged sword if the content it tries to enhance simply fails to meet any expectation. This was the case with ef: a Tale of Memories.\\n\\n\r\nSo little happens in the actual anime that trying to delve deeper into the story arcs would probably spoil the minimal plot points that ef has to offer, so I won't do that. Just know that this anime was based off an eroge, so needless and random sex themes are around just enough to break any possible immersion. Oh, I forgot that supernatural themes are also present for no damn reason too!\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, the only things that you'll find in ef are: the worst kind of melodrama, unnecessary fanservice and suggestive themes, pointless supernatural elements, hilarious attempts to make this disappointing anime seem deep (through different means), and a very diverse cast of boring, bland and whiny characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDetailed analysis below:\\n\\n\r\nGeneral: \\n\r\n-Atmosphere 2/10 --- This is a lackluster tale about teenager love. The repetitive 'cute' backgrounds and symbolism are simply out of place.\\n\r\n-Characters  1/10 --- Completely unlikable cast of characters. I couldn't feel ANYTHING at all for any of them.\\n\r\n-Story development & ending 2/10 --- I laughed at the ending. And I don't have a heart of stone or anything, like I said at the beginning I started this because I wanted it to toy with my emotions, and the only thing it did was to toy with my laughter. Unexpected results.\\n\\n\r\nTechnical:\\n\r\nArt 7/10 --- The actual animation is nice when it isn't trying to be 2deep4me\\n\r\nSoundtrack -/10 --- I actually didn't pay any attention to the sound. And the version I watched lacked any opening sequence so I won't comment on this aspect.\\n\r\nVoice acting 3/10 --- Whoever did Chihiro, aka the girl with defective memory, needs to quit voice acting.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal:\\n\r\nPriority (How eager I was to watch the next episode) 4/10 --- To be honest I was expecting for something to happen...\\n\r\nMemorability 7/10 --- I'll never forget the worst show I blindly ventured myself into.\\n\\n\r\nFinal score:\\n\r\n2/10 --- Horrible\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend this piece of anime to anyone...  maybe to some enemies? It was the first and last time that I actually take MAL's user recommendations seriously. \\n\\n\r\nThe themes in here can be quite inappropriate even though this show seems like an innocent tale about teen romance. Out of place scenes and dialogues that do not fit with some of the characters' traits are included just to be faithful to the source material, I suppose, which added to the overall hilarity. Not recommended for 14 y/o or younger. \\n\\n\r\nThere's also a second season or rather, a spin-off called ef: a Tale of Melodies. Based on the minor characters of this one. Needless to say I didn't bother to watch it, nor will I ever do it.\\n\\n\r\nThis has been my second review, which was more in the verge of becoming a rant, but it had to be said. Don't watch this.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I was inspired to write this view to provide an alternative viewpoint on this good, but not great, show.\r\nStory - 4:\r\nThe story suffers from trying to cover too much. By covering six main characters, the show dilutes the huge potential it had. In the first half of the series, the story abruptly jumps from character to character requiring jarring adjustments of the mindset of the viewer. Although it is possible to jump between situations and tell a good story, it is a difficult task that ef has failed to meet. I believe that, given more time to develop context and maintain fluidity, this show couldhave been a perfect ten.\\n\\n\r\nOf the two main stories told, the relationship between Chihiro and Renji is the most enthralling. The emotional struggle over the value of memories, while a familiar topic, is presented in a invigorating way through romance. The exploration of the concepts of memory and its part in defining identity give ef weight that could easily cause one to reflect on their own life.\\n\\n\r\nHiro's story, by contrast, is a massive letdown. He is confronted, oddly and without warning, with a choice between two girls. Kei's situation is common in anime, but left underdeveloped by ef, causing it to be forgettable. On the other hand, Miyako's character is refreshing, but an emotional connection to her is sabotaged by gross underdevelopment. Overall, ef is fortunate that Chihiro's story overshadows this one, because this part of the story is utterly unremarkable.\\n\\n\r\nThe positive reaction received by this show makes you wonder what it could have accomplished if it had decided to tell a single coherent story.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9:\\n\r\nMy weakness in understanding of technical side of anime, I thoroughly enjoyed the artwork here. Every scene felt natural to me, lacking clutter or voids. I particularly noticed colors doing an excellent job of supporting the mood at any given moment. Various effects used during the show (static in the library comes to mind) were overused without explanation, but besides that, the abstract presentation used at times did wonders for setting the theme of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8:\\n\r\nI don't have much to comment on. The music never detracted from events, but it never managed to push emotionally when it could have. Outside of the show, the OP was excellent, but I never saw the ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10:\\n\r\nI feel that the characters are what truly shine in ef. The cast as a whole is struggling between their pasts and their future dreams. Despite the disappointing amount of time available to explore the characters, many of them seem to have truly developed over the course of the show. As implied in the description of the story, Chihiro and Renji shine as the most interesting and endearing characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6:\\n\r\nAlthough I did enjoy ef, my experience was hampered by the erratic story telling and the unexplained random text and scenes used to fill the screen (and this is coming from someone who thinks the original ending to NGE, while not pretty, was excellent). The potential for great enjoyment here is lost do to the schizophrenic pacing not allowing the viewer to settle into the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7:\\n\r\nef - a tale of memories is a good, even if overrated, show. The show suffers heavily from an underdeveloped half of the story (that of course being on Hiro's side). While the half of show focused on Chihiro and Renji was a masterpiece in my eyes, the contrived nature of the drama and romance surrounding Hiro knocked the shows feet from under it.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a must watch for serious fans of drama and romance, but casual visitors to the genre will be much better served by finding a more lighthearted show or something easier to follow such as Clannad (specifically after story, of course).\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Please note that this review was written within a day of completing the series. I worry that my views may be colored by having, in the past few weeks, completed two shows that have become my favorite drama  and my favorite romantic comedy. I will likely rewatch the show and revisit this review later this year and update to reflect such a possibility.)",

            "content": "I loved this anime very much.  It is extremely emotional and very well written.  First of all, this was NOT a typical romance/love triangle anime.  \r\nStory:\r\nThe story is very well thought out.  It can be confusing at times, but is quickly cleared up.  It is full of surprises, morals and everything a fan of anime would love to see.  Its split into two parts with two stories following extraordinary events (damn, sometimes i wish i was him.) and is set in the same place.  I believe that the time of the stories were different, however, it is plainto see if you watch this series which i highly recommend.  Despite the switching between the two &quot;stories&quot;, it flowed extremely well with each other.  A climatic event may be coming up soon, but it suddenly switches.  This was perhaps, the only flaw that i found in the story.  To me, this bother was so miniscule that it didn't impact my viewing experience in anyway.  Hirono, the manga artist, had an awkward love triangle story going on, which brought frustration.  Despite this, it is highly amusing and intriguing to watch.  Renji's story was different; it brought depression and sadness.  Metaphors are used EXTREMELY effectively in this story.  Together, the series is overflowing with human-problems that it seems like it will be difficult to conclude the series in an effective way.  This was quite the opposite.  Through the drama, frustration, sadness, romance and jealous, the story concluded shockingly well.  One of the best I've seen.  Many shows try to incorporate many different themes, but have failed.  This is one that succeeded.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is beautiful.  The scenery (sunsets, beaches, etc) was gorgeous.  The desperation shown by one of the characters was amazingly portrayed.  The last few minutes of that episode was so nervewracking (in a good way) and was shown with a fading screen.  Very powerful.  The opening scenes during the theme songs were very colorful and bright.  It was very pleasing to the eye.  The characters were also very well designed and colored.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound?  I guess i could say the sounds were used effectively.  When doors slam shut, all you here is the slamming; there is no useless background noise.  Also, to emphasize the sounds, the screen fades to black so you can focus.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe character development was very good.  I fell in love with many of the characters, but that is just me.  Piece by piece the information concerning each of the characters comes.  By the end, you will know everything about each of the characters.  Development was great, we knew what we needed to know about the characters in order understand what was going on and why it was occuring at that specific time.  Each of the characters were unique, there was no character that acted the same way another character did.  Chihiro was my favorite character because her past seems so clouded and mysterious, i got hooked.  Her 13 hour amnesia makes room for a hugeee character development.  There are so many things that could result of this one small detail.  Also, the art of the characters are very good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAh, how do i describe this.  You are presented with morals and things you can do in reality to make your life better.  Never give up, follow your dreams, yeah yeah sounds repetitive.  Wrong.  Instead of mindless nonsense, characters state their respective problems, then pursue them to correct them.  I enjoyed the series very much also because of the story.  It never lost my interest.  It is one-of-a-kind.  How often do you watch a accident-victim who can only remember 13 hours of memories?\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAs previously stated, it is very unique, effectively incorporates romance, sadness, happiness, frustration, jealous and morals.  The art was amazing, story was topnotch, characters were lovable and most importantly, the ending was so well done, i don't think i've watched any anime that concluded such a perplexing storyline so well in 12 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nBeing able to watch how a character reacts in a love triangle can be very informative, and funny at the same time.  This is one of the best drama/romance/slice-of-life shows i have ever seen, so i highly recommend you watch it.  It sure is a tear-jerker and this is one i will not forget in 13 hours. ;)",

            "content": "\"Letting go of a bond that you have created will cause you the same pain as having your body torn apart.\"\r\nBonds and dreams- they are two of the things which connect human beings on a universal level. Humans are social creatures, they need bonds in order to keep on living, and they also need those bonds in order to strengthen their confidence in themselves when things do not seem to be going the way they wish them to go. Unfortunately, life works that way sometimes and as result, the bonds formed between lovers and even friends are at times necessary to remind us of whowe are and that which we wish to become. \\n\\n\r\n\"Ef- A tale of memories\", is an anime that showcases these ideas beautifully and in a way that is instantly relatable to the viewer who is watching it. These ideas are conveyed through the story, art, sound, and characters within the story.\\n\\n\r\nStory- The story of \"ef\" follows a group of individuals and their relationships with one another. However, the story is different then a lot of other anime's because of the way in which it is told. For example, while in most anime's it is not surprising to see multiple relationships viewed from different perspectives, I find myself hard-pressed to find another show where it is as nicely done as it was in \"ef\". However, much of why the story was good has to do with the overall presentation of the show, since without it, the story would not have been nearly as outstanding as it was.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Character development- Words cannot describe the importance of the art direction in \"ef\". It is the element which makes ef, well...ef. Interactions between characters take place in front of a backdrop that is constantly changing, seemingly reflecting the mental state of the characters as they interact, and often times the viewers thoughts as they are watching the scene. In addition, the incredible art direction seems to foster a deeper connection between the viewer and the characters within the story, a connection that is quite different then any other anime I have seen. The existential themes of the show are very much reflected in scenes where characters are left alone and given a chance to reveal their thoughts and feelings unabashedly- in such scenes, faces contort and change, and the color palettes of these scenes follow suit. It is truly an incredible thing to see. \\n\\n\r\nSound- The music in \"ef\", is just as effective in conveying the themes of the show as the art direction is. Music, like art, is an essential part of most peoples lives- much like dreams and bonds are- and the creators of ef did a great job in using this to their advantage, creating an almost unconscious connection between the show and viewers. For instance, in the real world there is a sound for every feeling, a music for every mood, and in ef these ideas are realized splendidly. To illustrate this, one need only look at scenes dealing with Chihiro and her dream world, since without the music that accompanied these scenes they would be nowhere near as effective, and let me tell you, anyone that has any emotional capacity whatsoever will know what I mean upon watching  these scenes. Voice actors are also incredible in this series, doing their part in making ef's presentation a thing to see.\\n\\n\r\nAll that being said, I enjoyed this show very much and I don't think I have had as much of a connection with an anime as I did with ef. But it must be noted that the show needs to be watched multiple times since if it is only watched once, viewers will lose many of the subtle nuances that make ef the show that it is. In conclusion I give \"ef- a tale of memories\", a 10, and while I do realize that I did not say to much about the actual story of the show, I must say that it is something that needs to be experienced rather than simply read about. So what exactly are you waiting for? Watch it, I guarantee you that you will not regret it.",

So what qualifies it to be a masterpiece?\r\n     The story:  Far to often stories are \"predictable\".You can see so and so breaking up with so and so ten miles away...  ef~ gives the to predictability vibe the entire story...  But you end up WRONG every time!  And what is awesome is; it doesn't lightly hit you with your wrongness, it loads into the cannon on an M1 Bradley fighting vehicle, puts the barrel about an inch from your head and lets you have it!\\n\r\n*SPOILER*\\n\r\n     Ex. Just when your expecting Chihiro to toss her small body from the roof of the school...  Something FAR FAR more devastating happens.... I don't want to spoil to much for you guys... (but I'll tell you a splat on the ground is easier to deal with)\\n\\n\r\n     Characters:  How emotionally involved am I in the Characters?  Are the characters so awesome and enthralling that you feel like your part of the story.  I'll be the first to say this sounds like it would be a well written story if you feel like your part of it but thats wrong.  It doesn't matter how great a story is if the characters don't invite you in to the story, their lives.  You feel like you are part of every dilemma, ever heartbreak.  That's what make these characters so great.  They've let you be in there lives, they feel real.\\n\\n\r\n     Lastly:  To be a masterpiece it has to change your life.  I'm not talking about sending away the voice in your head or getting you off your Zoloft prescription.  It has to of changed you on in the inside enough that you'll never forget the story and you'll be great full that you were touched by it.  Maybe it's as simple as setting an example that can make you a better person.  Maybe you understand some aspect of this world a little better.  Overall, where you the same person when the story was over?\\n\\n\r\n     One more thing.  The music is unbelieveable!  Masterpieces in it's own right!  Tenmon;  Look him up!",

            "content": "Wow.\r\nI have now seen this series twice... Both times it has hit me. Hard.\r\nArt:\r\nThis is the very first thing that strikes you, right from the start. \r\nIt's pretty amazing...\r\nThe animation style is constantly switching. This may be seen as simply a novelty be some, a tool to show off the animator's artistic prowess...\r\nYet it really isn't. The changes of style bring out what the characters are feeling to an even greater extent, and really helps keep it interesting and fresh. The attention to detail is also outstanding. The backgrounds, the foregrounds, the sea, the buildings, the sky...Especially that sky!\r\nCharacters:\r\nThe characters are also brilliantly designed andanimated, and the development in every case is superb. While not always the most original characters, each is different from the rest, yet you can still identify with all of them (though some hold grudges against either one of Hiro's two love interests...).\\n\r\nThe relationships between the characters, however, are what really make the show. Everyone is connected in some way, and they all have their own individual problems to take care of. By the end, you will be overwhelmingly attatched to at least one of the characters, if not all.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nYeahyeahyeah, love triangle, 50 First Dates, knights and princesses, etc, it's been done... I still love it.\\n\r\nI feel it is a 10, but I can see how others would argue differently...\\n\r\nI reckon it makes a big difference whether you watch this show in one sitting, or over the course of a few days/weeks. However, it is personal preference...Some prefer the continuity of one sitting, while others prefer to have some time to think about each episode before moving on to the next.\\n\r\nTry both. =] You'll want to rewatch it eventually anyway.\\n\r\nThe story remains strong throughout, with a few extremely memorable and powerful events, and once finished, you will be thinking back over it for days to come.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound is excellent all throughout the series - it's used to great effect, especially in the build-ups and climaxes. I recommend using headphones to experience the full effect.\\n\r\nWhile I liked the opening and ending themes (a couple are really catchy!), I don't think they suited it too well... For instance, at the end of episode 7... The sudden intro of a J-Pop song sort of spoiled the effect. However, this sentiment may not be shared by all... Plus, it's only a slight problem. It detracts from the sound rating, and not the series as a whole.\\n\r\nI do like how they changed the theme songs each episode, though.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nAs you can probably tell if you read all this, I really enjoyed this series. I laughed, I cried, and was completely connected to every character, and after seeing it again, the feelings were even greater, if anything.\\n\r\nThis is great to watch, great to rewatch, and great to think over afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nHighly recommended, for anyone - even if not a fan of the genre, as it does not just stick to the usual clich&eacute;s, in any aspect. Absolutely brilliant.\\n\\n\r\n10/10. Pretty much perfect. Much love to this series. &lt;3.\\n\r\n~\\n\r\nThis was my first review, so any comments would be appreciated.\\n\r\nCheers.\\n\r\n~\\n\r\n07 April 2008 - Edited a couple of times after some feedback.",

            "content": "Ef a Tale of memories was based on the visual novel ef: a fairy tale of the two.  One of the biggest selling point of the game was the amount of CG and its presentation.  The story was, at least according to my roommate, pretty standard fare.  So how is a studio going to adapt a game where the biggest selling point was the CG and presentation, where such things are standard in the anime medium?  While a part of me would love to see Naru Nanao draw everything herself, that would be completely unrealistic (sighs&hellip;).  So I resigned myselfto accept the fact that ef would likely be simple story with normal animation and excellent character designs.  I watched the trailer and it seemed to hint at my suspicions.  Then I watched the first episode&hellip;\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation and animation was anything but normal.  If ef a fairy tale of the two (the game) pushes the envelop for presentation for a visual novels then Ef a Tale of Memories (the anime) pushes the anime medium to its limits in terms of presentation.  Yes, I should have known better, since the animation studio is Shaft and Akiyuki Shinobo is supervising, the same team that brought us Negima?!, Pani Poni Dash, and Sayonara Zetsubu Sensei.  There really is no way to describe the way the art/animation is handled besides watching this or other Shinobo works.  The unique animation is often used to amplify scenes, to act as metaphors, and used simply as an artistic take on certain scenes.  In addition, the colors and visuals will often tell us exactly how the characters are feeling and/or reflect the mood of the scenes.  The clouds in particular are often used in this manner.  Although, there are time I think its just there to remind us that Shaft is animating this&hellip;  I&rsquo;ll admit it does take some time to get used to ef unique animation and this may deter some people from watching.  Although, it does get toned down after a few episodes.  Probably due to Shin Oonuma taking the lead more and reducing the influence of Shinbo.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before the story isn&rsquo;t anything special and we&rsquo;ve all seen them before.  However, once again it&rsquo;s the presentation that breaths life in an otherwise typical romance anime.  There are 2 major storylines running parallel with each other, Myako/Kei/Hiro and Chihiro/Renji.  Both storylines are loosely related, with Kei being Chihiro&rsquo;s sister and both sharing themes of memories.  I do think that ef could have done better if they only focused one story or have the 2 stories more related to each other.  However, I can forgive this as there isn&rsquo;t enough material for one story to fill 13 eps.  Also, in the game the stories are told linearly (ie one couple, then the next) and there are 2 degrees of separation between Miyako/Kei/Hiro and Chihiro/Renji.   \\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, this is the first time I&rsquo;ve been truly blown away by voice work.  There were scenes where the voice actors had to carry nearly half an episode by themselves and oddly enough those were some of the most memorable moments I&rsquo;ve seen in anime.  The big thing that surprises me is that I had never heard of any of the voice actors.  Ok, if theres one weakness in the voice acting its Chihiro&rsquo;s voice, it makes me want to pierce my ear drums&hellip; \\n\\n\r\nThankfully, I didn&rsquo;t&hellip; The ost is another one of ef&rsquo;s strong points.  It features many calm and soothing pieces as expected by Tenmon.  I really like how there is a special ending for each of the female characters and how well each of the ending really fits the characters and their story.  In addition, the ending that gets played depends on what the episode focused on, especially that last moments of the episode.  The OP, Euphoric Field was quite nice despite being Engrish and was very fitting for the series.  Also, I really love the minor changes they made in the OP for the last episode.  It only shows how much detail the creators put into making ef.  All this detail makes the series very rewatchable so one can catch all those small things one may have missed the first time around.           \\n\\n\r\nThe original character designs were originally done by Naru Nanao (female characters) and C2=Galore (male designs).  Naru Nanao is one of my favorite artist so its pretty obvious that I love the character designs.  &lt;insert fanboying for Naru Nanao here&gt;\\n\\n\r\nOne interesting thing about ef is that when I stand back and think about it, there are moments that can be seen as overly dramatic.  However, oddly enough it doesn&rsquo;t bother me.  I attribute this to ef&rsquo;s unique atmosphere and because of this it somehow fits/feel natural.  If the creators had decided to play it straight and went on a more normal route with the animation then those moments would had definitely stuck out.  \\n\\n\r\nI love Ef a Tale of Memories and it is only overshadowed by 5 cm/s for 2007.  To all those that love romance/drama anime titles watch this now!  However, a quick warning, the unique animation may deter some.  \\n",

            "content": "Ef- A Tale of Memories is a twelve episode anime based on an adult visual novel. Of course, there have been some decent anime based off of H games, not many mind you, but maybe this'll be one of them. Let's take a look and find out.\r\nThere are really three loosely connected stories in this. The first is a love triangle with a moron, an idiot and a brainless twit. The second is about a naive moron who meets a girl with a memory defect and the third is about an imbecile trying to make an art film. The only one that had the potentialto be interesting is the second and that potential is squandered both by the time wasted on the other two stories and by a major problem with the entire anime, melodrama. This anime is melodramatic to the point of ridiculous. Every minor thing that happens in loose relation to the plot gets needlessly exaggerated in an attempt to make you empathize with the cast which is a futile exercise but more on that later. What isn't absurdly melodramatic is just dull and drags on. It's not like there wasn't room for interesting story in this, the execution just fails.\\n\\n\r\nNow, let's talk about why empathizing with the characters just isn't going to happen. The biggest issue is that they're overly dramatic, dull-witted teenagers. They're like the people that no one wanted to be around in High School because they turned everything into a huge issue from a teacher chastising them to another girl wearing the same shirt as them. It's not charming or endearing, it's annoying. If I wanted to watch high school students being overly dramatic and stupid, I'd be a teacher. Really, the characters needed to be older in this, not to mention more three-dimensional, for the concept to work and that simply isn't the case.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about the art in this is going to be a bit longer than usual. They try to be artsy with such stunning visual effects as randomly going black and white or cropping out almost everything on the screen to focus on one small thing, but that kind of style doesn't work unless there's a coherent reasoning behind it. That isn't the case with this, the anime isn't that intelligent. It's simply trying to appear intelligent through superficial means without actually having intelligent content as such it's just annoying. It's the equivalent of that one idiot who tries to look smart by wearing glasses that they don't need. No one falls for that either. Take away the effects you get art that's pretty mediocre with uninspired character designs and scant backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting isn't particularly interesting or memorable. I don't blame the voice actors for it since they're working with a script that fluctuates between melodramatic and dull. Honestly, it's a bit impressive that they manage to not be completely obnoxious during the melodramatic scenes. The music is so utterly dull that I really can't remember anything about it even though I just finished the series a couple hours ago as of the moment I'm writing this. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 2/10. There's a minor character who mentions having a crush on her female upperclassman once, but it's a throwaway scene that goes nowhere and is never mentioned or alluded to again. Ef- A Tale of Memories: where scenes don't have to connect to the plot in a meaningful way.\\n\\n\r\nMy final rating for Ef- A Tale of Memories is a 4/10. I honestly don't hate it. It's a mostly dull and mediocre series with a few annoying factors that make me consider it sub-par overall. I can't really recommend it to anyone unless you really enjoy high school melodrama.",

            "content": "It's very rare that I come across anything that I can actually say is hard to review. Being an avid gamer, and maintaining a review blog I have much experience doing it, and it's never really tough to find a flaw in something. As far as anime goes, I'm a fan of just over a month now. In this time I've seen 40 different shows, the most prolific thus far being Chobits. Since I finished watching it I've searched and searched for anything that could move me the way it did, but couldn't find it, not even in Clannad, something all my friends couldn't believe.\r\nAndthen ef: A Tale of Memories happened.\\n\\n\r\nef: A Tale of Memories tells two stories at once one of Hiro and his love triangle involving his childhood friend Kei and a girl he stumbles upon Christmas Eve and winds up spending the day with named Miyako, and the story of Renji and Chihori, a girl who suffered an injury from a car accident at the age of 12 that causes her to forget all her memories from 13 hours ago. \\n\\n\r\nI'll get this out of the way right now; Hiro's story is nowhere near as touching as Renji's. That's not to say it isn't good, and perhaps to some it may be just as good, but I just couldn't connect with the characters on that end. The outcome to it just didn't seem to go the way it felt like it should have, and both Miyako and Kei felt somewhat immature and unprepared for a relationship.\\n\\n\r\nRenji's story however, is an awe inspiring masterpiece. It's difficult to really point out what makes their tale so incredible; there are so many ways. It sounds so cliche to say, I know, but for the first time in a review, I honestly can't point it out. Renji's strength and determination to stick with Chihori despite her condition is inspiring. Equally so is Chihori's desire to keep Renji in her thoughts; constantly re-reading her diary entries of him in order to not forget him, to the point that she passes out from sleep deprivation. And those are just two of the things that left a strong impression on me; rest assured, the whole of their story is unbelievably heartwarming and at times, tragic.\\n\\n\r\nAssisting both of the stories is the absolute best animation I've seen thus far. What makes ef's art so breathtaking isn't simply in character or environment design (which is still better than both Clannad series in my opinion). The show will often change contrast or camera angles multiple times during a scene to go along with what a character is saying. In a flashback scene describing Miyako's past as a child, the color scheme is switched to pastels and made to look as though it was colored in crayon.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I wasn't particularly impressed with Hiro's story, it is where you see these types of scenes and effects the most, and they're incrediibly powerful. One of my favorites was a particularly emotional scene in which Miyako is leaving messages on Hiro's cell phone as she gets stood up by him. It's simply a white screen with a simple picture of her sitting there. As you hear the messages she's leaving you can hear the pain and anxiety in her voice increase with each one. Each message is written on the screen as she says it, causing it to gradually fill up the screen with text, each message adding to the chaos, mirroring her mental state during each message. Simply amazing. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as sound goes, voice acting is very well done, though that only goes for the English dub; I don't do subtitles. Music is good as well, but I honestly feel having the English version of the opening theme \"euphoric field\" was a mistake. There are multiple ending themes, but honestly none really stood out for me.\\n\\n\r\nWhat did impress me though was the use of sound and audio effects throughout the show. Much like the various visual effects that were used, sound is also changed up and tweaked in order to reflect the mood of the moment. It's not as powerful or moving as the visuals, but they still contribute to the unique feel of the series.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, we have the characters. Much like the story, the characters in Renji and Chihiro's half are a little more likeable, though oddly enough, I feel the characters' backstories are done better in Hiro's story. My main issue is that Hiro, Miyako, and Kei all feel somewhat shallow and generic in comparison to Chihiro. I'll admit  Hiro being a successful Manga writer before even finishing high school is kind of interesting, and Miyako's turbulent past with her parents is sad. But it's really tough to compare to Chihiro's backstory, which is one of the best I've ever encountered, if not the absolute best. After witnessing all the pain and suffering she's endured through her life, it's hard not to feel a sense of elation when real, pure happiness befell her.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know if I would say ef: A Tale of Memories is better than Chobits I know that might seem blasphemous to most, but my reasons for adoring Chobits as much as I do are for another time. Suffice to say that ef is right there next to it on my favorite anime list. There isn't a single thing I won't remember here; the moving story, incredibe visual and audio effects, the endearing characters. All of it is a breathtaking experience, one that anyone, not just anime fans, needs to experience.",

            "content": "Ef: A Tale of Memories. I\u2019m baffled by this anime score of an eight and above. It\u2019s clich\u00e9, generic, unoriginal, it doesn\u2019t do anything to differentiate itself from other romance anime. It does the exact opposite while trying to be more profound and deep, I\u2019m all for that, but it was in my opinion horribly executed. It\u2019s if half of Myanimelist was watching this during their teenager years or was one their first few romance anime. It was a hardship to get through and I love romance anime.\r\nStory: 3\r\nThere are two main stories ongoing at the same time while correlating with one another. An angelappears, well not exactly a mysterious girl known Yuuko, narrating our stories. The more favorable story beginning with Renji Asou and Chihiro Shindou. It starts off with Renji always catching a glimpse of girl with an eye-patch sitting everyday by herself at an old abandon train station with book in her hand. Eventually, he musters up the courage to introduce himself to her thus begins their friendship. There\u2019s a reason with Chihiro is always by herself and doesn\u2019t at the time attend school. However, that\u2019s for Renji to find out why.\\n\\n\r\nThe next story involves an upcoming manga creator Hiro Hirono and his childhood friend Kei Shindou along with Miyakomo Miyamura. Hiro is always doing things half-effetely never committing to them with or giving it his all. Hiro ditches school to follow his true passion creating and writing manga, even though Kei always insist on him to attend school. When Hiro meets Miyakomo, he finds her very odd and friendly, at times even annoying seeing how she wants to be around him for no real apparent reason.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: 4 | 6\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m all for symbolic meaningful imagery, but it felt really out place in this anime. The weird transitions cuts made during a conversation, sometimes it close and personal into the character face or they were out frame or out of placed. The questionable locations it showed at times. It was as if it was trying to be deep to the audience, even though at times the show itself wasn\u2019t that. The opening was mediocre at best, nothing to great. The music though was pleasant and went along with the more emotional scenes. Looked and feel like an older anime, with an exaggerated enormous eyes and wacky hair nothing wrong with that felt a bit outdated or more of moe look.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3\\n\\n\r\nNone are really worth mentioning nor do they stick out, each one has his/her own problems.  Although some of their actions are questionable. At times I found them to be annoying and cringe worthy. They\u2019re portrayed as high school student so without a doubt some characters can extremely selfish for their own motives, even if it causes pain to others. If I had to nitpick there being a worst girl it was Miyamoko due to being increasingly needy and irritating at times. Yuuko was most interesting character even if only she was in the anime for a handful of a few minutes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy it for majority of the time. It did have a few heart-warming scenes her and there, nothing to more to that. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts/Overall: 3\\n\\n\r\nThe score for this anime was deceitful. I was just waiting for the episode to end and it seemed to drag along longer than expected. It\u2019s really generic following lots of character traits I don\u2019t particularly enjoy but if done right can be pleasant to watch, which it was not in this case. It\u2019s imagery and out of place segment scenes, left me scratching my head wondering why they were chosen. They were nice to look at but it felt like those scenes interrupted the flow of the anime at times. It just wasn\u2019t my cup of tea, but I am in small percentage of a community that thinks otherwise.",

            "content": "ef: A Tale of Memories(which I will shorten to just \"ef\" from this point on) was an anime I'd heard was great, but was one of the many sitting in my backlog. However, a recommendation from Reimei-Chan (should definitely check her profile out) gave me the motivation to power through it over the break, so here we are. I like this anime a lot, and definitely got more out of it than the romantic slice of life I was expecting. Here's the breakdown:\r\nStory: 9\r\n     Ef's story is composed of three groups of characters that, initially, areunrelated, but intertwine as time progresses. This makes it a little hard to follow in the beginning, because no explanation is given as to what's going on, and there's identical twins involved, which doesn't help. That only lasts until about halfway through the second episode though, and then things clear up. Each individual story by itself is excellent, but the real power here is how the stories connect to form an overall theme. It's hard to explain without spoilers, but the story is great, and while I didn't exactly like how some of the relationships developed(muh ships), the ending more than makes up for it. I did find the pacing a bit weird though, with the romance really focused in the last 3-4 episodes. It felt a bit rushed. Overall, you won't find it as emotional as say, Clannad or Angel Beats! (manly tears), but it definitely is chalk full of feels towards the end.  \\n\\n\r\nArt:10\\n\r\n     I loved the art style here. Not only does the art style look current enough that you can't tell it's from 2007, but there's also all sorts of effects used as well. Some scenes will be entirely done through character silhouettes, some will be in red or blue, and sometimes you get just a few frames of black and white. It reminds me of Bakemonogatari, but nowhere near as extreme. These effects are beautiful, keep things refreshing, and help set the mood throughout the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\n     Usually I care more about the sound over the art in anime, but not in this one. While I do remember there were several piano pieces that I liked quite a bit, nothing in my mind sticks out as being exceptional or memorable. It's good, but not great. The opening and ending are really catchy though, so there's that. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\n     With the three separate stories, this anime features a lot of different characters. Also a benefit of the individual stories, they all get a large amount of screen time and a lot of back story. Because of this, the character development is great, and the characters themselves are very human like. None of them are perfect or over idealized, but they're also not overly flawed. With a little imagination, this story could easily play out in real life. I also like that what I consider to be the main character in each story specializes in a specific artistic medium(writing, drawing, and photography). It's a minor detail, but I found it interesting considering how important the art is to the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\n     Definitely very enjoyable, I found that I could watch around 3-4 episodes in a row without trouble. I wouldn't recommend watching it this way though, because I think you miss a lot of the smaller details. I powered through it in about 5 days, and then ended up watching again because I wasn't completely satisfied with the ending the first time around. So, I think to fully enjoy this one you need to space it out and let each individual episode sink in, as opposed to watching 3-episode blocks. If you do power through it though,  try watching it again, especially if you felt like something was missing. I didn't find it unbearable re watching it, and I think you'd be surprised how many things you missed the first go round. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8(Very Good)\\n\r\n    Ef is a great anime, and  one I highly recommend watching if you like the romance/slice of life genre. As I said in my intro though, even if those aren't your genres of choice, I'd still watch it, because there's so much more going on. You can't just fit this one into a genre like that, you just can't. It doesn't do it justice. I'm not sure if it was obvious from my review, but it was really challenging to try and break this anime down into categories, because, using a cliche, this anime is more than just the sum of its parts(also, if it was obvious, terribly sorry if it was a struggle to read in some areas). TL;DR Watch it, and if you like it, know that there's also a great visual novel that goes along with it if you like those.",

I'm not a poet at all nor a writeror anything but after watching this anime,i feel like a poet, haha funny, really the whole story is poetic,too beautiful for a simple minded guy like me to describe it by words.Some said its a sad story but to me it's not, its more like a beautiful mind that has been made in an anime.If you look at it scientifically, many of the concepts are wrong and one who look at it logically might hate it,so its not for someone who love action or anyone who don't appreciate Shakespeare.But still,i suggest you to watch this anime.\\n\r\n           I want this to be a review but its not really a review at all,its more like what I felt after watching it, sorry.\\n\r\n   But anyway:\\n\\n\r\nArt 10: Everything is breathtakingly beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10: For its uniqueness and the joy it gave me after seeing it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10:The character is the strong point.For a 12 anime episode,the depths of emotion they bring out from you is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10:I complete it in one night, i couldn't have slept without finishing it and even after finishing it, i kept thinking and thinking in bed and i'm gonna rewatch it again, its that fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10: I would give 10+ if i could hehe. \\n",

            "content": "Every animation studio popularly known has a specific twist that sets them apart from the others. Whether that was mo\u00e9 cranked up to eleven, beyond outstanding CGI, crisp and clean standard animation, or even just the distinct way that every character was designed. These distinct quirks lead to being able to differentiate between studios and their ability to present something of their own unique style. However, every so often we're presented with something different. Something that pops, something that you could not forget no matter how hard you tried.\u00a0Every animation studio popularly known has a specific twist that set them apart from the others,\u00a0something asmemorable as the birth of a studio. These shows blow our expectations away and find a way to go above and beyond for every aspect of the show. In taking the risk to create something away from the usual, the show becomes something memorable to those who see it and commonly pave the way for an entirely new style of presentation to come. One studio that was capable of pulling this off early on was the now beyond popular Studio SHAFT. SHAFT's animation style was uniquely different from any other style anyone had ever seen and demanded that its viewers be not only mentally sucked into the show, but visually captivated as well. SHAFT combined their outstanding early animation with powerful visual symbolism and stories that would last a life time. SHAFT chose a presentation style that would be memorable on more than just the story level and made all of their shows an experience everyone must see for themselves. One of the masterpieces this studio pulled together was the anime we will be reviewing today: Ef: A Tale of Memories. \\n\\n\r\nEf: A Tale of Memories is the anime adaptation of the adult visual novel \"Ef: The First Tale\" and is a romance anime revolving around two primary storylines. The first follows protagonist Hiro Hirono, a professional manga artist, who works his way into a love triangle with a girl whom he meets on Christmas Eve, Miyako Miyamura, and a childhood friend of his, Kei Shindou. Hiro becomes friends with Miyako one Christmas Eve when Miyako steals his bike to chase after someone who stole her purse. However, she soon gives up and Hiro finds her unconscious with his bike completely ruined. After Miyako wakes up, the two spend the rest of Christmas Eve together and end up developing strong feelings towards each other. When Kei finds out about this relationship she has a hard time dealing with her own feelings towards Hiro and ends up making a tremendously dramatic time. In the second storyline, we have protagonist Renji Asou who meets a girl at an abandoned train station, Chihiro Shindou, and promises to be her first and only friend. He finds out that she can only retain thirteen hours of memory due to a tragic childhood accident and has a hard time finding ways to keep a meaningful relationship with the girl as he becomes very fond of her. These storylines and concepts are far from unheard of, and have lately become quite common at that, but the way that the story is written is more powerful than what I initially expected. The show does its best job at making genuine conflict as well as fitting in a perfect amount of character development that makes you form very strong feelings and opinions about every character, but I digress. The way that the story and character interactions are written is so perfect at moments that it's impossible for your mind to be focussed on anything other than the events currently happening. Both Hiro and Renji's stories are unique in their own rights but find ties to each other and make both stories relevant towards a common storyline. Along with the visuals, the story helps create an incredibly addictive property that the anime holds to its name, making you want to come back and watch it as again as soon as you can. Though, with the positive said, there was still plenty wrong with the way the story was presented. This was mainly in weak moments that felt incredibly awkward to watch and left me feeling that the scene could have been far better written. These moments are easily overbalanced by all of the positives that this show has to offer, but they are still present enough to affect the overall experience of this show.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the characters are concerned, we're given a moderately large cast that are all (more or less) unique...or at least are presented this way. When initially presented with each one, you get the feeling that you've never experienced a character quite like them before, but as the show progresses they begin fitting more into the usual tropes. This isn't to say that ALL of the unique qualities that every character originally had completely vanishes over time, but they do fade to the point where you can label almost every character with one of the dere types. If I had to pick a weakest suit that this show has to offer, the characters would be my go-to decision. Despite the way that they transform into duller forms of themselves, the way that the characters are initially presented is nearly perfect. No character introduction feels awkward and no two introductions are remotely the same. The same goes for the characters themselves. While they do fit into archetypes as if that was that they were written for, each one feels solid and no character is like another. Both of our protagonists feel unique in the way they go about everything and all of the supporting characters fit their own unique ways to help support the show. The way the show kept the cast nice and diverse in ways, helped the fact that half of every character was an archetype. This way, despite that we've already seen every character in the past (if we're avid anime watchers) they were spread out enough so that it didn't stick out and wasn't a real problem unless you're extremely picky about those types of things.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this show was something that caught me off guard and will continue to have that special place in my heart as the first anime I watched by Studio SHAFT, and I have yet to see a single show out-do the extremely unique animation style that was done in both of the Ef series. There was something unique and symbolic on the screen at all times and every last scene popped out. The animation was unique to the point where it dictated the mood of the scene and amplified already existing moods beyond that which any other aspect of presentation could ever do. The animation is something I've yet to even see SHAFT do again and looks like all of the aspects of animation they were practicing before later dividing it up into the different animation styles the perfected for shows such as Monogatari and Madoka Magica. While many might argue that the sheer amount of CGI usage was completely unnecessary for the production, I beg to differ as in my eyes it added to the presentation in an absolutely perfect way. Nothing was ever flat, nothing was ever static, and every setting was clear and impossible to mix up with any other. I would try to describe the animation, but the only real way to understand how unique the setting is animated is by experiencing it yourself. The characters were animated in a way that everyone looked gorgeous to a point that's better than modern anime character animation. I, honestly, would go as far to say that the animation in this show was perfect. When watching through the show for the first time, I saw absolutely no flaws in the animation and was awed by it in a way that only ufotable has been able to do since then.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack in this anime wasn't too special. It fit the scenes well but not in any way that was drastically outstanding. The opening is a nice \"Engrish\" song that is one of my favourite anime openings to date, but nothing else in Ef: A Tale of Memories' soundtrack was special in any way. The voice acting was superb, every voice sounded as if it fit its character perfectly with the exception of one character: Chihiro. Chihiro\u2019s voice actress, in my opinion, was a terrible casting choice. This isn't to say that her voice actress, Natsumi Yanase, is a bad voice actress as some of her other roles I found were perfect for her character, but when voicing Chihiro her voice felt like an awkward last-minute casting decision that could have been given to a number of better voices for Chihiro's part.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nWith all this said, I personally enjoyed Ef: A Tale of Memories a lot. As a matter of fact, Ef is my personal favourite romance anime to date. Something about it just appealed to me in every way shape and form and lead to me having a very good time watching it, even with all of its flaws. It has appealed to me in a way that even makes me interested in the visual novel it was based off of. For anyone with a soft spot for drama and romance shows, this one is perfect for you. Everything was done in a way that still holds to be good at the time of writing this review and is an experience I would gladly suggest to anyone. Every aspect of the presentation works perfectly together and if even one piece was slightly lacking or slightly overdone then the show wouldn't be as perfectly flawed as it is now. Studio SHAFT did an outstanding job with this series and if you haven't yet, I suggest watching it very soon. I give Ef: A Tale of Memories a 7 out of 10.",

            "content": "Very rarely does an anime touch my heart. For me who has seen my fair share of anime, it seems that I have started to build up a resistance against the emotional effects of seeing such emotional scenes. That wasn\u2019t the case with Ef: A tale of Memories. After watching countless animes that has done nothing but barely scratch the surface of my icy cold heart, here comes Ef: A Tale of Memories, one of the very few animes that managed to make me feel once again the reason why I loved anime.\r\nStory: A story of love, sadness, success and triumph over the impossible. Theseare some words that can describe what Ef is about. This is literally one of the BEST animes out there in terms of a great and well-planned story. Right off the bat, Ef gave me the impression of a great anime. The very first episode managed to catch my attention, it was mysterious, it was interesting, and it got the better of my curiosity. It started off as pretty confusing, with three stories happening simultaneously and yet, once the story got rolling, it never slowed down. From the very beginning until the end, it was filled with suspense, twist, turns, revelations that there never was a dull moment. There were moments filled with romance that can make you all warm and fluffy inside. There were moments of comedy, which will make you red with laughter. There were also moments of sadness, which will make you break down into tears. It was a mixture of so many things yet it managed to blend them perfectly, creating a perfect balance between three different concepts. It also manages to glue you down to your seat. Every episode ends with a perfect cliffhanger that it\u2019s impossible to stop watching after you\u2019ve started. To put it all in a nutshell, the story of Ef is like a painting; a mixture of many colors, yet it manages to portray the diverse amount of emotions that it is trying to show. Overall I give it a 10/10 for creating such a complex yet compelling story that never bored me for a single second.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and sound: Shaft animation managed to create another masterpiece. Having animated some of my favorite animes, I had high hopes, and I wasn\u2019t disappointed. Shaft delivered exactly the type of art and animation that Ef needed. It\u2019s simple, smooth, with dramatic accents in the intense parts. The sound was also beautiful. The background music was subtle, it was perfect of each scene, whether happy or not. It is also worth mentioning that the OP and the ED, which was only both shown once, was just perfect for the anime. I give it a 8/10 for sound, because the OP and ED were only shown once and a 10/10 for animation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: A girl who forgets, a professional manga artist, an amateur movie director, an aspiring novelist, an athlete and a rebellious student. These are the description of main characters of Ef, and while there are some other interesting characters, those that I mentioned are the most important. To me actually, the characters of Ef are one of its best points. Each character is well developed, and no character is left hollow. You can actually relate to them in some way, and after some time, you can grow attached to them. Each of them is also unique, and no two characters can be considered as a typical anime stereotype. Overall, I give it a 10/10, because everything is perfect; the characters manage to grab the hearts of the audience, and whether you love them or hate them by the end of the series you will realize their importance and that the story would not be the way it is if even one of them was missing. They are like a puzzle, each character connects one to the other, and if one is missing then everything will be ruined.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: A splendid anime indeed, and needless to say, I really enjoyed it. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, this anime piqued my interest and as a fan of story-driven animes, this was a truly memorable experience. There are very few animes which has managed to glue me to my seat like this one, and this one managed to make me everything in one go, That\u2019s how enjoyable it is. I would give this a 10/10,\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I\u2019ve explained everything I liked about this anime, so I\u2019ll just stick a big, fat 10/10 in this section. Well, not really. There are still some things that I liked about his anime that cannot simply be explained with words. It gave me a strange feeling, something like a mixture of love and sadness, or something entirely different. I don\u2019t know, I guess the only way for you to know what it is is to see it yourself.\\n\\n\r\nNow, this review might seem a bit biased, as it seems like I gave every criteria a perfect 10/10. But really, it is that great and it deserves that score. I would gladly put it on my favorites list, along with some of my other favorite animes. I highly suggest that you watch this anime, because if you don\u2019t, then you are missing out on something HUGE. I can\u2019t believe about how long I left this anime in my to-watch-list. If I knew it was this good earlier, if only I knew that this gem was hiding in my list all along, I would\u2019ve watched it instantly. It\u2019s just that I was afraid that this would turn out differently than I expected. As my final regards, I can guarantee you that this Ef: A Tale of Memories won\u2019t disappoint you unless you are the kind of guy/gal who doesn\u2019t a love story with a great plot.\\n\\n\r\nIf this review has helped you in any way, or if have any comments regarding about my opinions, my style of writing or anything at all, don\u2019t hesitate to write a comment on my page, I will make sure to take note of your criticism and reply to you if possible. Btw, thanks for reading this review, because this is probably the longest one I\u2019ve written up to date, so thank you if you\u2019ve read everything :))\\n",

            "content": "Story: It&rsquo;s a two-way story on 2 different guys, one involves a love triangle and the other had problems on their own. Think the story isn&rsquo;t too original? Better think twice. Although the story isn&rsquo;t that common, we&rsquo;ve seen it a few times on several movies and some TV drama but this one primarily focuses on one thing, MEMORIES. It was conveyed that memories could cause sadness, despair, loneliness, heartbreak and helplessness, but there isn&rsquo;t a reason to stop and carry the pain for the rest of your life. The first episode may be utterly confusing, I personally didn&rsquo;t like it at first because Iwasn&rsquo;t able to understand the whole thing, but once you&rsquo;ve clearly got a good grasp on the concept, it&rsquo;s fairly easier to predict and you&rsquo;ll just leave that right there and focus how your emotions will react while watching from one episode to another. Other than that, the series was very well planned that you can&rsquo;t find any holes in the story.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Stunningly beautiful! This is the anime where creativity was applied to it&rsquo;s fullest. As the mood of the story shifts, so is the animation. The animation here doesn&rsquo;t define how vivid it was or how it has good perspectives but rather they mainly use still images and make use of colors as a primary spice on the viewer&rsquo;s eyes. The animation signifies every mood of the story that will make the viewer&rsquo;s emotions go with it. The animation as well gives the impression of the character&rsquo;s inner desires in a psychological point of view. It was clearly presented in the animation how the characters were feeling that you don&rsquo;t really need to hear any narration or talks just to understand it. It was presented in such a unique concept that seems completely new to Japanese Animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound goes fairly well with the animation. It helps to illustrate and build the tension that the animation brought. Not much to say about this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters were very well developed and well defined as it goes with the story. With them struggling with their frustrations and some psychological issues, you could see how much they&rsquo;ve evolved in just 12 episodes and it doesn&rsquo;t seemed rushed at all. The development was mixed fluidly all throughout.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Definitely worth a perfect score, writing a review isn&rsquo;t really my thing, but after I gave the last 4 episodes a marathon a few days ago, I felt that it&rsquo;s unjust if I won&rsquo;t give a review at all. I felt ashamed that I opt to halt watching this until the next summer break, I could have missed a once in a lifetime anime. And not to mention that I already started to cry before a minute passed when I started with episode 9 last night. My tears fell nonstop until the very last minute of the final episode.",

            "content": "Pursuing happiness, seeking love and acknowledgment, chasing dreams, and all being led with the faint whisper of hope, Ef is one of the most emotionally powerfully pieces of art out there.  Redefining how animation can be emotionally jarring to all the senses, Ef illustrates how anime can really be more than just a show; it's an art.  For those who enjoy heart-wrenching drama and heart-warming romance, this is a story you do not want to miss.\r\nEf is not like any other anime you have ever experienced.  Instead of watching what the main characters go through from an stranger's third eye, you experiencethe emotions as if you were there and a part of them.  To be able to see the emotions of pain, hear the echoes of loneliness, and feel your stomach turn and throat tighten up feeling your hope slip away, the art and the music, together, play such a powerful melody that you can't help but get chills from the effect.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the novelty of the graphical art and audio, the character development and story progression itself makes this anime worth watching.  The tale of three separate love stories loosely tied in relation and theme.  Each character is dynamic in their own way with their own hopes, dreams, and fears.  They seem so real that you can step into their shoes and understand them from the inside out.  Fictional characters?  Maybe.  But the emotions you feel watching them, those are real.\\n\\n\r\nI love this anime and enjoyed every second watching it.  The experience is just too hard to describe.  It's just a really powerfully piece that you just have to watch to understand.  I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys dramas.  It will make you cry; I guarantee it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Being my first review, I first want everyone to know how I view what an anime should be like so that when I state that something is good it won't coincide with anyone else's opinion of good. (Skip the next paragraph if you just want to get to the review)\r\nA really good anime should have a story full of plot-twists, suspense, and at least be a bit more creative that its predecessors. The story then must be fluidly combined with beautiful art and passionate music. Character animation mustn't be like something made overnight, yet the character design itself must portray the roundness or flatness ofthe character to a T so as to avoid the confusion as to the purpose of the character. With all these elements combined together, enjoyment will eventually ensue.\\n\\n\r\nWhat \"ef- a tale of memories\" did was exactly just that. \\n\\n\r\nThe story was unique in almost every way. The portrayal of not just one but two main love stories occurring at the same time is a challenge, yet the way both didn't hinder your perception of the other but instead complimented the other story really made the anime score top marks on the story category. It may have started off on a sprint and came at you at random directions at first causing you to get a bit lost, but your patience will be rewarded as those beginning pieces of the puzzle start to fit in and the whole story gets unraveled. Only few rival to the such creative story telling as \"ef-a tale of memories\" some you may have already seen before like \"Clannad (After Story)\" or \"Angel Beats\". \\n\\n\r\nSo for plot I give it a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nNow when moving onto the art, it was something that I at first didn't like yet I eventually grew to appreciate. First off you got to remember that this is 2007 so don't be expecting anything that just felt like it was produced last week. There were at times when the quality may have lacked a bit like during flashback scenes which I believe could've been drawn better than rough sketches in a white background, but the rest of the anime art was great. The scenery, the detail in the background, and the overall attentiveness the creators put into the art with 3 year old tech really makes this story score high marks in the art category.\\n\\n\r\nSo for art I give it a 9/10. \\n\\n\r\nNow the anime offered a wide variety of different kinds of music. Openings were usually predominated by rock and band typed music, while those \"hold-your-breath\" moments were the usual piano, yet I found it delightful that they added some violin in there to change things up a bit. The openings were catchy, and the time synchronization of the pianolin music with the situation was perfect. The music was a great factor in doubling the emotions the anime creators wanted you to feel, and I believe they did a great job doing it.\\n\\n\r\nSo for music I gave it a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNow for character, I just have to say that character design wasn't something I liked all that much though I didn't necessarily hate it either. I like moe, but I think they over did it a bit here. The female characters were in the \"Kawaii!!!\" with three exclamation points category instead of the normal, one exclamation mark. Because of the over-moed characters, it was hard for me to relate myself to the story a bit, but it didn't stop me there. Character development was what pulled this category up. Everyone changes in the story. Usually only one or two character changes majorly in any anime but I needed an extra hand or two to count the major character development changes here! I loved it! It kept the story fresh, bold, alive! I score high marks here as well!\\n\\n\r\nSo for character I gave it a 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWith this down, enjoyment is all that's left and judging from my past scores it's not that hard to say that I give enjoyment a 10/10?\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is unique in ways that it challenges past techniques of portraying the plot where instead of just one plot, you have two simultaneous ones together that compliment and support each other. The mood and suspense of one section is usually carried onto the next section which also increases suspense. The art, the story, the wonderful music just makes it a great watch for all you drama, romance lovers out there. Just to warn you there might be some suggestive scenes (coff* coff*) but it's PG-13 so suck it up. It might've done well to just cut out those suggestive ideas out but hey, the anime is so good, a small flaw like that wouldn't even be registered on it's polished surface.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall this anime is definitely a 10/10 masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nAny feedback good or bad is helpful peeps!",

            "content": "Ef - a tale of memories is an interesting anime portraying emptiness and lonliness. In other words it is about the essense of life. However, there is one thing and only one thing that can defeat both of those and it is of course: Love. This anime tries to show us that no matter how hard our situation might be and no matter how lost we might seem, there is always that small glimmer of hope that someday, someone will come along and rescue us. \r\nI sware I must have cried throughout most of this series, which is the reason why I don't see goodnow because my eyes are all red. Excuse me for any typos I might make.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the story. It's breathtaking to say at least. From lonliness through jealousy to lust. This series does a spledid job at describing all human emotions. Absolutely flawless. Basically the question asked at the beginning \"what is love?\" is answered at the end with \"It's a force that can create miracles!\". Well is it, you ask? Of course and this anime visualises that perfectly. Many of the main characters here go out of their own way to help their loved one. Which is naturally what a love-struck person would do but the series explains WHY they're driven to do that. Other very intriguing issues are also covered. For example, is it possible for man and a woman to develop and maintain a platonic relationship? This series solves that question with a love triangle (which suprised me). A boy and a girl know each other from an early age. The girl calls him a brother but actually she likes him more than just a brother. A lot of time passes and the girl hopes that their reltionship will grow into something more. Then comes along another gal and the big chunk of drama starts from there. The guy's torn between the two and it is very interesting to watch his actions, it draws the viewer into the story. However, that's only the beginning. There are more than just 2 or 3 love stories in here and in the end we're shown that in each case there is a similarity between them. \\n\\n\r\nWhat's unique about \"Ef - a tale of memories\" is that instead of just focusing on a few main characters, in this series, everyone's kinda involved. For example, some characters don't know each other and won't do to the very end but the anime treats all of them with equal importance. It's like splitting a huge story into separate pieces but at the same time making sure that it still stays connected. It's astonishing how they've actually managed to pull it off but it works. The charaters are all amazing but there were two that stood out for me the entire time. Those are Shinji Asou and Shindou Chihiro. Their love story is the most dramatic. I can't exacly describe why because it would be a spoiler but I'll say this. Would you be willing to sacrifice a lot of time and patience for the other person, even though that person may not be able to appreciate that tomorrow? There I already said too much.\\n\\n\r\nMusic in \"ef - a tale of memories\" is sadistically depressive. It's as if you voluntairly kept stabbing yourself in the head. I can even say with all confidence that if you played it in a maximum security prison, the inmates would beg you for mercy within a decasecond. Ironicaly, the OST fits nicely with the situations in the series which makes it even more depressive and tear-jerking. \\n\\n\r\nArt is absolutely great. Combined with the music and the story it creates the ultimate drama experience. It's as if you were a bystander, watching the characters from a few metres away. That's how realistic it gets.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I'll say that everyone who enjoys watching drama, kinda slice-of-life or romance must see this. It is very emotional and everyone should prepare themselves mentaly otherwise you will be caught off guard and wind up unconscious on the floor of your room. By the way, I'm not trying to be sarcastic, I'm dead serious. Going into this series half-heartedly will not be good for you.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the ending is great. One of the best I've seen.\\n\\n",

            "content": "If you expected me to hate this, then just read the rest of my review.\r\nStory~\r\nIt isn't divided into separate arcs, but rather, the two stories blended together with each other. The first plot, which is pretty much your average love triangle-- just that. Average. Though the way they executed it and the way the characters developed was at least a refreshing love triangle, compared to all the other crappy ones I've been watching. It really irritated me in some parts, but for the most part it was better than your cliche love triangle. The second plot that blended in with it was another matter ENTIRELY.It was so beautiful in every form that I really found no fault at all with it. It's been a while since I've seen such a dramatic romance that I've actually enjoyed. Some people in anime have disabilities, which makes a romance difficult. But this disability was one I've never seen before. Maybe I haven't watched enough romance, but this was beautifully unique, and perfectly dramatic. I liked it so much more than the other plot. In fact, if it didn't have the second plot in here, this anime would have only gotten a 6 or 7 maximum.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt~ \\n\r\nThe style itself seems somewhat cliche-- the big shoujo eyes and shiny hair. But the way it moved so smoothly was amazing-- but the camera angles and different styles they approached were gorgeously refreshing. They'd take a black background and draw the character's image into it, then fill it with something in the background, like the ocean waves or the sky, or anything else. It very much fit the mood when it needed to, and never detracted from the feeling. Text is constantly popping up on the screen, in a sort of way to portray what's going on in the character's head, or even just foreshadowing something. It's all very enthralling and well-written.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound~\\n\r\nMost of the time, I noticed the sound. Granted, some of it was a very cliche style for romance anime, but other pieces were just so beautiful that I couldn't help but notice them playing. Some of it was simple instruments to cast a spotlight on the mood, while others had just a slight voice in the background. The opening song was a rather interesting one, and did a good job at portraying the characters all in their unique ways. It's hard to explain. And... Well... I was so excited to move on to the next episode that I never listened to the ending song, so... Anyway, voice acting. Each character was brought out perfectly, and their voice actors did a good job when it was needed. They started out filling a sort of cliche-sounding character, but delved much deeper into it when it was good for the series. It was all very nice.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter~\\n\r\nOh my. The characters from the first plot seemed like your typical shoujo characters, but were later fleshed out. They all had their own unique quirks, I suppose, but they started out too cliche for my liking. Even though they were fleshed out, some remained more on the average side than the unique one. Overall, they were still good characters, and made for an entertaining(ish) love triangle. The characters of the second plot started out the same, seemingly (sort of) cliche, but with their unique quirks. They were a bit fleshed out, but for the most part they grew and developed beautifully and dramatically. Chihiro's development was rather dark and depressing, but I suppose it all ended well. Renji's development was sort of based around Chihiro, bit even through all his confusion and conflicting feelings, he stayed himself. It was all very interesting, but sure depressed me...\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I'd recommend this anime with pride to any romance/shoujo freak. It really is one of the gems in its genre, and I'm simply delighted I stumbled upon it. The overall confusing and seemingly tossed around plot may turn some people off, but I stuck with it since I could only hope it would end somewhat decently. My expectations were exceeded, and I'm just delighted I found this. \\n\\n\r\nIt's definitely one of the best romance I've seen, and though it is refreshing, it's not calming by any means, since I did find it rather dark and depressing-- but there wasn't anything wrong with that. No, the drama was gorgeous, and every moment kept me enthralled. \\n\\n\r\nI'd definitely pass on this title to almost anyone.",

            "content": "\u201cThere are only inevitabilities and accidents in the world and what you\u2019re going to do, but nothing will happen if you only wish for it however wishing is the first step to achieving your dream!!\u201d\r\nI'm pretty sure many people has comes across this line at least once when a decision had to be made that determine which path to take, \u201cI have no idea on what I want to do!\" and that the things you are doing presently aren't exactly fulfilling what really you want. You are only doing them to fulfill other people's expectations of you!\r\nThis story is a very exquisite piece of workthat comes across with a philosophical message. People behave very differently and they constantly changing their mind depending on their experiences or memories. Decisions aren\u2019t easy things to initiate because no one can account for what will be in store for them in their future.  This story shows the perspective of 3 selected male individuals deciding on what they should do when a serious decision needed to be made.  However what they do share in common is that they all feel that something is missing in their lives and this story shows how they find this missing piece when they each encounter the female protagonists.  However not everyone can adapt to the sudden changes in ones environment, thus having mental breakdowns/ despair on what they should do next. The art style and sequence of colors and frames really capture the emotions of the character during each scene. The artist also incorporates various sceneries using them as motifs and messages.   I find that point shine the most in the entire anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is very comely, the art styles of each character are drawn in very easy on the eyes, and no characters were exaggerated. The colors especially gave the most tone to each character\u2019s story(s). Sometime it varies in color mixed with abstract symbols and sketches which defines the mood of the characters. Like sometime it goes black and white to create a lonesome/ troubling effect and immediately fill with colors when their mood changes. Like yellow for happy and blue for sad.\\n\r\nThe music inserted really emphasizes or deepen the mood/feeling of the situation and I find it very captivating.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the structure of this story is placed very nicely, like how they incorporate 3 main protagonists with their own princess that they need to save really change the audience\u2019s viewpoint. Each protagonist has their situation, each more devastating than the next, however they are linked on the message that all three different story contributed to.  \\n\r\nThis anime is a tragic, sad yet very beautiful piece. To be honest this is my 3rd time re-watching it and I still like it. I highly recommend this anime to the anime fan who love a good romantic drama. Hope you enjoy it!!\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u201cPut your memories into wishes you don\u2019t want to forget\u201d\\n\\n\r\n~Later\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Can one know happiness, without knowing sadness?\" Throughout this show you're going to find many scenarios relating to this one statement. Can there be peace, without war? Can there be love without hate? It's also applied to more simpler situations such as where Hirono (one of the protagonists) has two girls going for him. He desperately tries to hold onto both of them, nearly leaving him with nothing in the end. Thankfully, he salvages his relationship with one of the girls and it all ends up, more or less, fine. It just goes to show that you can't only have peace. To have one, youmust first give up the other one. This same theory applies as far back as yin and yang. Such a deep moral can be found throughout our every day lives, as long as we look.\\n\\n\r\nEf - a tale of memories(Ef for short) also deals a lot with memories. How is our personality defined? Are we defined by our memories, our choices, or both? If you where to forget everything every two years, would you be a completely different person at the end of the next two years? If someone where to change your past, would the present you change? I think after you watch this anime you're going to find yourself asking these same questions. Could you handle losing your memories every two hours, yet only holding onto fragments of memories every day? Honestly, I don't think I could handle it.\\n\\n\r\nEf, in a  nutshell, is a tearjerker. I've never cried from watching anime before (and I've watched some sad romances) yet I found myself bawling countless times while watching Ef. Sure, Ef might not be for everyone. When I started watching Ef the idea of 2 protagonists threw me off. I really love falling in love with the main character, so I was kind of disappointed. However, I wasn't disappointed for long. I fell in love with many and almost all the characters. Being able to sympathize and cry with each character is a wonderful thing I've never felt in an anime before.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, I was completed blown away by the art in Ef. It was new and innovative. It was like someone took an anime from the future and gave to us 10 years too early. When I looked and saw that this was aired in 2006, I was honestly shocked. The beautiful drawing angles. The color changes. The symbolic paintings. You could derive a lot about the story from the art alone. Another thing I've never felt in an anime before.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, you're going to want to give this anime a try. My overall score for this anime is actually a 9.4. Honestly, I'm not really a romance lover. It's kind of a thing I do in my spare time when I'm not watching thrillers. For a romance to get this high of a score is a wonderful thing. I'm currently watching ef - a tale of melodies, and It already deserves a 10. As I said before, if you have any interest in romance animes, give Ef - A Tale Of Memories a try.",

            "content": "ef- A Tale of Memories was more than just a show, it was an experience. A beautifully crafted series that pulls your heart strings in multiple directions. I would not lie and say this is one of the best animes I have ever seen, and this is coming from someone that has seen more than 300 anime shows and movies in my lifetime.\r\nThe story of this anime follows a rather unorthodox method of storytelling. There isn't really one or two \"main\" characters, but rather several characters that each have their own unique story. It was quite refreshing to see an anime series that focused moreon a whole group of characters and each of their stories rather than just a small set. It was also amazing to see how each character's story tied into the other, making you feel that these aren't just isolated, individual stories, but rather one giant story that's tied together by smaller subplots. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story was great. There are two main storylines in this anime. The first revolves around love triangle that was formed between Hiro Hirono with Miyako Miyamura, a girl he met on Christmas in an unorthodox fashion, and Kei Shindou, a childhood friend of Hiro's who he was supposed to meet on Christmas but didn't due to getting tied up with Miyako. I found this storyline to be fascinating for a love triangle story arc. Usually when you get a storyline like this in an anime, it tends to be cheesy, forced, and has no dramatic tension whatsoever. Not with this anime. The dramatic tension between these three characters is intense and the emotions that these characters and how they are written do not feel fake or forced. The second main storyline revolves around Renji Asou and Chihiro Shindou, Kei's twin sister. Renji meets Chihiro for the first time at an abandoned rail station and they become friends. He discovers after meeting her a few times that she suffers from a rare form of amnesia, in which she forgets all of the events of the day before, thus she keeps a diary. This amnesia is due to being involved in a car accident when she was younger that also took her left eye. The main premise of this story is that Renji helps Chihiro write a novel that she couldn't previously do before due to her condition. The more Renji and Chihiro meet, the more you feel that their friendship goes beyond that of \"just friends\". Without going into more details due to spoilers, this story is absolutely fascinating and a tearjerker considering the pain and suffering Chihiro goes through.\\n\\n\r\nEven the subplots and side characters of this anime are incredibly interesting, including Kyosuke's story, which is sort of a main storyline in this anime as well since it is so intertwined with Kei's story. Yuu Himura's character also plays quite an intricate role since he became Chihiro's guardian after her accident and he suffers the pain of taking care of her every day. Then, there's Yuuko Amamiya, whose mysterious appearances and disappearances throughout this anime leads to intrigue and interest about her role in this series. All-in-all, the side story and side characters tie very well to the overall portrait that this anime paints.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation/artwork of this anime is phenomenal. This anime was beautifully crafted and the artistic design that went into its creation is certainly brilliant. It sets the mood very well when tension builds. It does more than just \"tells the story,\" it goes beyond and shows us visually what the characters might actually be thinking. The music was beautiful and somewhat depressing, but I mean that in a good way because it sets the tone of the anime extremely well. \\n\\n\r\nThe thing I loved most about this anime was how it made you build an emotional investment toward the characters. This isn't an anime where you're hooked into each character right from the get go, but as you watch the series, you start to understand each character and become invested in their story. I found it funny how I would laugh when they laughed and cried when they cried. You almost get the feel that you are somehow part of that character's story. As I mentioned before, another thing I absolutely loved about this anime is how it all came together. Several plots and sub-plots that came together to build a great ef universe. It was amazing how none of these sub-plots retracted from the overall story. There wasn't anything in this anime that felt like \"it didn't fit\" or \"was forced in\". Everyone and everything about this anime felt like it fit in the overall story.\\n\\n\r\nI have to give props to ef-A Tale of Memories for going against the norm and try telling a story that didn't have one main plot. They pulled it off magnificently. If you're looking for an anime that you want to build some emotional investment in, with a love story and drama tension along the way, then this is one anime (along with its sequel, ef-A Tale of Melodies) that you have to watch.",

            "content": "I'm kind of angry to be honest. How can a drama/mystery/romance with an >8 score be this bad? I was really looking forward to it being one of my next favourite romances, and this is what I get. \r\nThe first half really wasn't all that bad. Things progressed decently, I loved the OP and music in general, animation was good and I appreciated the art shifts to an extent. That Renji character looked ridiculous, but other than that all of the girls were decent, even if I don't usually like character designs of this kind. The whole memories thing seemed a little contrived but Ifigured it'd get emotional by the end. Nope. \\n\\n\r\nI consider it a bad thing when I find myself laughing at supposedly dramatic and heart-wrenching moments. This was also around the time the art shifts started to get on my nerves. \\n\\n\r\nAfter a certain point, the balance between the various stories was lost, and every time we were immersed in one story al I wanted to do was watch the one they weren't focusing on. It seems neither could keep my interest because the personalities of all the characters had undergone a dramatic shift into annoying territory. Almost all motivations come from somewhere in the distant past, as if everybody is suffering from the same illness. (Tale of memories, yeah I know, but that doesn't make it any better). Really there almost no characters that stayed likable for very long. Well, except the guy with the film camera, I thought his character and little story line was interesting. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, this was a talky-one. But not couples talking, no the guy characters usually talk to someone else about what they should do about their girl. And when they do, expect a lot of melodramatic one liners and art shifts that don't really fit anything. They try to be profound, but it really falls flat. \\n\\n\r\nMy idea to make this a much better anime: Get rid of all the other characters and story lines and focus on the film maker trying to capture the beauty of the enigmatic girl through his camera lens (And the subsequent romance that arises from finding her and enrolling her in his film project). That little story line (for me) was more captivating and interesting than all of the others combined. \\n\\n\r\nAll around, what we have here is a very disappointing romance that misses every target it tries to hit. Undeniably, a below average release. I honestly don't see what the others are seeing.",

            "content": "What makes anime such a fantastic medium is that directors aren't subjected to the confines of reality. In other words, they can manipulate the scene as much as they please to create symbolic effects: patterns imposed on silhouettes, a character's eye moving on a white surface, and distorted colours just to name a few. Personally, I can't see how live-action cinema can take those techniques and apply them to the actors without making it feel weird and awkward.\r\nEf: A Tale of Memories stretches the artistic boundaries of anime by making you ask yourself \"What just happened\" at the end of every episode but also leavingyou dumbfounded by the exquisite imagery. Ef follows 2 stories: the tale of Hiro the up and coming shoujo manga artist and the journey of Renji, a normal high school student with a passion for writing. Being a romance driven anime, Hiro is set up with Miyako, a frequently-absent girl with a mysterious past, and Kei, his childhood friend. On the other path, Renji encounters Chihiro, the twin sister of Kei, at an abandoned train station. He takes a fascination in this girl and soon meets up with her everyday at the same train station. As he gets closer to her, he realizes that Chihiro has a strange condition that throws a wrench into their relationship (hint: like One Week Friends). \\n\\n\r\nBeing that the anime follows two stories at once, it was confusing keeping track of whose story belonged to whom but as I grew closer to the characters, it was not difficult to follow. The story takes you on a wild, psychedelic rollercoaster ride. What I mean is picture your favourite feels story and on top of that, add Picasso's cubism artwork. In a way, the art serves as the main driver of the story and without it, the romance would have been like any other love triangle story. \\n\r\nThe romance elicits the tears, the cheers, and the throwing-laptop-across-the-room feelings. However, although I enjoy watching stories with love triangles, Hiro's love triangle is not one that is very original. On the other hand, Chihiro's story is the one that will have you wondering where that onion-chopping ninja is hiding.\\n\\n\r\nEf has a solid cast of characters. All of them struggle to find their desires and inevitably, they find out that the process is gut-wrenching. My favourite character would have to be Miyako because I found her backstory the most appealing and also the most supportive of why she acts the way she does. Compared to the animation and background art, the character designs do feel underwhelming but nevertheless, they are very attractive to the eye. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation. Where do I begin? Shaft did an incredible job. If you showed this anime to someone who has only seen post-2010 shows, they wouldn't have guessed Ef: A Tale of Memories was made in 2007. Shaft's animation is similar to ufotable's action sequences: smooth, crisp, and meaningful. The only downside to Shaft's unique animation is that it is not for everyone. It is abstract and perhaps steals the spotlight from the story. If you prefer your anime to be very realistic, Ef is on the opposite side of your spectrum. Either way, you will remember the animation for a very long time.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was decent and the OP is pretty catchy. I would say the voice actors did a good job conveying the emotions of the characters, especially during tender, heart-breaking moments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Ef: A Tale of Memories is a great anime. It's an anime whose art will always be remembered as bold and whose animation is modern. For any fans of romance and as well as anyone who appreciates great art, this is an anime to watch.",

            "content": "ef-  a tale of memories is a slice of art masquerading as an inspiring, emotionally-charged anime that asks us to fight for our dreams, take charge of opportunities, and to break free of the proverbial ``chains`` that bind us.\r\nIn this review I'm attempting to go for a somewhat more \"minimalist\" feel which will hopefully appeal to those who want straight, fast, hard-hitting investigative reviewing. \r\nQuick synopsis:\r\n\"Do you have any memories you don't want to forget?\"\r\nef- a tale of memories is an arresting story which follows our main characters as they each struggle with the discovery and procurement of their most treasured dreams. Depending onhow one counts, there are no less than SIX (6) main characters (Alternatively, one or two of those can be argued as more minor for the count to be dropped to 4 or 5); their adventures are chronicled in the space of 12 highly-acclaimed episodes.\\n\\n\r\nBreakdown of this anime:\\n\\n\r\nArt: 5/5\\n\r\n+ Unconventional usage of perspective and colouration adds heaps to an extremely well-drawn set. \\n\r\n+ Lighting effects are used to great advantage here.\\n\r\n+ Particle effects and mesmerizing skies, water take the art from beautiful to extraordinary.\\n\r\n+ CG and drawn animations add to the depth of the art.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4.75/5\\n\r\n+ The story is impressive and includes a colourful cast of characters with all sorts of haunted pasts and character \"flaws\". \\n\r\n+ Well paced, with each episode opening and closing parts of the past or the present. \\n\r\n+ Any show that attempts to fit six interconnecting character arcs in a 12 ep series is laudable; this series manages to do this without any noticeable discomfort.\\n\r\n+ Underlying symbolism abounds, with references to connectedness and \"breaking free\" artfully executed throughout.\\n\r\n- The few minor charcters are not really explored, instead giving occasional cameos.\\n\\n\r\nSounds: 4.5/5\\n\r\n+ Soundtrack is well executed, being used at the right times for the majority of the show.\\n\r\n+Sound effects are realistic, from the clasping of a bag to the wind.\\n\r\n+ Japanese voice acting is right-on.\\n\r\n+ Euphoric Field by Tenmon and ELISA was a fantastic piece for the OP's. I prefer the Japanese version (OP2), but both versions really fit the anime.\\n\r\n+ Both OP's and all ED's are well made in general.\\n\r\n- Music in some instances was slightly overplayed.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, ef- a tale of memories sets a new standard for any modern love-romance anime hoping to compete in a crowded market of mediocrity. Combining a revolutionary CG/ drawn/ SFX style with a heartwarming, emotional, and empowering story, ef manages to stand head and shoulders above competing love-romance titles. \\n\\n\r\nI watched this in 720p, and if you can find this title on Blu-Ray I highly recommend it, as the incredible aesthetics are best viewed and can be fully appreciated in HD.\\n\\n\r\nIn mentioning that this series sets a new standard, I say so because I truly hope that other series producers can capture the beauty and style reflected in this title, innovate a bit, and port it to other stories.\\n\\n\r\n\"Put your wishes into the memories you do not want to forget...\"\\n\\n\r\n9.5/10",

            "content": "Perfection is a term that is impossible to achieve in any form of media. People have different ideas on what perfection is, and there will always be something, no matter how minor it may be, that will prevent this phenomenon from occurring. That being said, ef - a tale of memories, is definitely not perfect, but it is the closest that I have seen any romantic drama come to perfection. I myself am not a huge fan of the genre, but ef really did a number on me, drawing me in and creating a world that I wholeheartedly began to love. \r\nFirstly, I'll quickly saythat the art and sound for this anime are amazingly beautiful. The art is outstanding and the music has a very classical feel to it, with a lot of violin solos. They both add greatly to the overall mood that ef is trying to present and are probably one of the best of the time.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of course revolves around 4 stories in total (although 2 aren't fully explained until melodies), each fairly interesting in there own right but not really the focus of the anime itself. What each story does, is set up the characters to grow and develop, and it pulls this off beautifully. It is really easy to feel the emotions and struggles that each character is going through, and it is quite possible that you can relate to one or two of the cast. I think this is probably the strongest part of the anime, to center it on character development rather than a central plot. It uses the story as a stepping stone to create a dilemma or wall that the character must overcome to improve him or herself as a person. Using the creative form of storytelling, the viewer gets a great feel for the mood, and it gives an amazing sense of immersion that left me with a warm feeling of enjoyment to see the characters i had followed all along have their problems resolved, while at the same time leaving me saddened to see it all end so soon. \\n\\n\r\nOf course the characters themselves are all colourful and imaginative. I really don't have too much more to say on the characters themselves. As stated above, each one grows and overcomes their own challenges and thus are very likable. I will say that I like Hiro especially, probably because I found i could relate to his struggles the easiest (that's the struggles with finding out what to do for the future... not the struggle on whether to pick the childhood friend or the fellow slacker). \\n\\n\r\nNow, as I said before ef isn't perfect, and it does have a few flaws to it. My biggest complaint in this series is the use of repetition to create a more powerful mood. Now repetition is a great artistic device, and really builds up the atmosphere of a drama such as this. The first time it is used in ef is a surprisingly haunting scene in which (without giving too much away), a bunch of cell phone messages are read out loud to the viewer. That description doesn't do it much credit, but the constant reading of the messages in a similar fashion really built up a great sense of urgency in you and overall created a very memorable scene. The director must have liked this idea though, because he decided that repetition was going to be his trump card as he uses it about 5 more times in the following episodes, and it begins to lose its charm after a while. The last time they used it in melodies i caught myself rolling my eyes and saying, great there goes 5 minutes to try and pad out the episode. One other complain I have is a fairly minor one, that I can't really say without giving away huge spoilers, so I will just say that I was very disappointed with the resolution to Chihiro's arc. It seemed illogical to me and I might have set my expectations a bit higher than it gave. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, ef is definitely a very good drama and a very good anime. It created an atmosphere that sunk right into my very soul and left an impression that I won't be forgetting any time soon. I'll recommend this to any guy and say that it doesn't mean your a pussy if you tear up a little bit at the end!",

Well, it has seinen genre.\r\nStory (8/10)\r\nThe concept of the story is interesting, it is unique and not just focusing on one character. Every character has their own background and story development. The story flows rather slow paced, but it flows nicely. It's not easily predictable and you can become curious of what happens next. The climax before the ending is amazing, and the ending was great. Every character made their decision.\r\nArt (8/10)\r\nArt is great. The background is good and I think the art style is unique. Theywould give different colors depends on the situation. The art style can really picture the atmosphere and situation well.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nSound is good. The BGMs fits the situation well and not only fit but also help to enhance them. OP euphoric field really fits the theme of this anime. Every girl has their own ED song.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\r\nCharacters are great. It's the strong element of this show. They have their own interesting backgrounds and condition. What they do according their condition and how they develop in it is very well told.

I think the development and the flow of the story is the one that make make enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nWhat a great show. I think it's one of the best romance anime I've ever watched so far. I'm interested to see ef: A Tale of Melodies as well. I hope the story is as good as 'memories' or even better.",

At this point stop reading and watch it... then send me a message, I'd like to know what you learned from it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy lesson learned:\\n\\n\r\nThat we are all Chihiro, to some degree, as we become more and more involved in daily life the endless series of routines start to strangle those few precious moments which are really important to us. If we don't stop every now and then to recall them, they will be lost forever. \\n\\n\r\nIs there a memory you would like to never forget.\\n\\n\r\nJan 2013",

(Not going to though, unless hubby or friend wants to) The characters were very watered down to me.. a bunch of the story lines for the characters felt kinda slapped together.. Be warned that it takes until the 5th episode or so for the story to actually get rolling so if you're more into fast paced anime like kore wa zombe desu ka (Is this a zombie?!) for example, I don't recommendthis series as it is a slow start.\\n\\n\r\nFinal analysis: I dunno. I've watched far worse anime than this. 50/100 It's not awful but not amazing.\\n\\n\r\nI Hope this helps anyone. I'm sure I'll get hated on for scoring it so low. xD ONTO THE SECOND SEASON!\\n",

If anything it just tells you to go watch it NOW.\r\nThe following occurred while I watched and finished the entire season from start to finish: \r\n-_-  :/  o.o  o.0  0_0  D:  :D  XD  :E  D':  :S  T_T  o_0  :'D \r\nThat's probably the best way I can describe how I felt while watching such an emotional anime that seems to dramatize 1st world problems to the umpteenth degree. Anyways I digress. I'll askthe following questions to see if you'll find this tale worth hearing:\\n\\n\r\nDo you like romance anime's that have NO COMEDY whatsoever?\\n\\n\r\nDo you like to have your romance anime's start off Meh but begin to grasp you and hold onto you tighter than a python? \\n\\n\r\nDo you prefer to have the main male protagonists oblivious or indecisive?\\n\\n\r\nDo you enjoy seeing STRONGLY implied sex scenes? \\n\\n\r\nDo you wish to see a conclusion that is cliche yet oh so satisfying? \\n\\n\r\nIf you have answered yes to 3-4 out of 5 questions then immediately stop reading and go watch it. Your still here? GOGOGOGOGOGOGOGO!!!!!! \\n\\n\r\nIf you have answered yes to 2 out of these 5 questions than your better off viewing it regardless. It's that awesome/heart gripping. \\n\\n\r\nIf you have answered yes to all 5 questions then give yourself a cookie, some milk, and a box of tissues. You'll need it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you have answered no to all 5 questions then go fuck yourself.\\n\\n\r\nNo need to say anything more about this anime to clarify how awesome it is. I'm wasting your time if you continue to read this. Want something different from Clannad or Kimi ga Nozomu Eien? Here's you answer. This should be considered the most \"helpful\" \"review\" ever because it smacks you in the face saying \"If you love romance anime's than watch this one NOW. You WON'T REGRET IT.\"  \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The strength of \"ef - a tale of memories\" doesn't lie in its heart-wrenching love stories, but in the wonderful imagery SHAFT achieves throughout this gem of a show.\r\nThe story itself is nothing too out of the ordinary for fans of the genre, but it is by no means bad. Only the coldest of hearts could keep you from tearing up during the course of \"memories\". But it is not without fault. The secondary couple (Renji and Chihiro) seems to rely on the gimmick of memory loss. As one would expect, they go through the appropriate amount of hardship, but this plot device felt cliche.Fortunately, their story ends up being anything but.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is equally interesting, but no one stuck out in particular. This doesn't mean they're boring in anyway, but I didn't find any of them endearing or memorable. Again, this isn't to say this has a large impact on the story, which is the show's second biggest asset. \\n\\n\r\nI would even go so far as to describe the plot and imagery as Key-esque, reminiscent of \"Clannad\" or \"Kanon\".  I wholly recommend \"memories\" to anyone who is a fan of the genre for what I would equate to as a nice healthy \"snack\" to fill your appetite. The Persona-inspired imagery, and great atmosphere is simply icing on the cake.",

            "content": "ef~tale of memories is the story about six main characters all linked in one way or another and are around the same age and their struggles in their love lives as well as their dreams.\r\nThe story was fantastic. Though a bit complicated, it was intricately woven with unpredictable twists and a unique and original plot. It can be a bit cliche at some points but it was still hard to tell what the outcome would be. Some will definitely complain that the story is confusing and it can be, but after reviewing everything carefully it creates a beautiful story, so patience is advised when watchingthis series. The only problem i had with this story was the lack or realism in that it is portrayed as a bit of a fairytale with a happy ending for everyone. Of course such endings leave a good impression on the audience but there were some parts where i was like &quot;it could never happen in real life&quot;. But aside from that it was a fantastic story, it warms the heart and makes us wish we could have such an ending.(in my opinion.)The drama and romance portrayed make this a must see for romance and drama fans, further more the story does not only emphasize on intimate relationships but on one's future as well which i found very absorbing especially since many of us, including myself, could empathise with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere are not enough words in my vocabulary to describe the beauty and skillfulness of the artwork in this series. The characters were drawn very well and the sceneries were just breathtaking. The scenic drawings were like paintings truly artistic. Another unique area in this series is how the story is expressed with special visual effects and how they they use the colours to enhance the atmosphere such as the use of a negative viewpoint(black and white). A spectacular piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was another area that deserves praise for the amount of effort placed in this field as seen with the numerous endings(5 endings i think) that correspond to different episodes depending on how the episode ended and who the focus of that episode had been on. Also an english opening song was adopted for a change but it still suited the story very well and the lyrics do have meaning in this series. The background music inserted here and there did do a good job to enhance the mood and atmosphere in the story. fourth best sound managed anime i've seen. (first-NANA, second-Moon wo sagashiteru, third-Bokura ga Ita)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all possesed a good amount of depth for such a short series and equal emphasis was given to each of the six main characters. Though little depth can be found in some of the side characters, i felt that the mysterious nature of these characters was necessary or even purposely done to create this wonderful story. Perhaps they will receive more depth in the second series . The characters all strive for their dreams and the struggles they go through are lifelike and real to a good extent. The drama is effectively brought out by the characters and we also see many viewpoints from the different characters present in the show. Without such characters this story would not be possible.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is a must see for romance and drama fans and even if you're not one you might find that you share a thing or two in common with some of these characters. I really enjoyed the series as a romance-drama fan but i think it as more than just preference the art and sound played well to portray a nice and unique story. I don't think it can really be compared to any other romance anime. Though it does draw some similarities to True Tears ,another beautiful anime, but still this story is more absorbing and attractive than true tears in my opinion. SO for all you people looking for a new anime to watch that is unpredictable and original and still ends nicely even with the massive amount of drama then give this anime a try, you should not be disappointed.",

            "content": "This is my first review and I would like to apologize for any incorrect grammar.\r\nFirst of all, I have seen the whole series twice: once before reading the visual novel and once afterwards. \r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story is great. Although it could be confusing as it is a story that consists of two stories from the point of view of different characters. Each characters shows their own struggles in life and how love can help each character live through their pain. I gave this a 9, whilst I very much enjoyed the ending between Chihiro and Renji, to the point that I actually preferred over tothe Renji/Chihiro ending in the visual novel, however as a consequence they did not concentrated as much on the relationship between Kei and Kyousuke.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nWhile I do very much enjoy the animation done by Shaft as their style of animation is very twisting, you would know what I mean if you have seen their over works such as Bakemonogatari and Maria Holic.\\n\r\nI gave this an 9 rather than 10  probably due to my biased opinion of comparing with the animation within the visual novel. (Which i believe Shaft was also involved to an extent). However with Shaft's animation style it brings serveral different tones effectively.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nI have enjoyed the music very much, particularly the ending song used in episode final episode of the series 'Yuukyuu no Tsubase 07mix' as this song was used as the opening in the first part of the visual novel.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nAfter watching the series a second time, i liked the fact that they have brought in the original voice actors that was used in the game, I thought that it showed consistency as an adaption is aimed to bring the same feel to the original material to an extent.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, as an adaption, it was beautifully executed. At times I feel that some parts of the story was superior to it's original material, mainly the Chihiro/Renji section. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys romance/drama titles",

            "content": "Warning this review may contain spoilers. \r\nFirst impressions, so another romance anime based of the v.n.\r\nI should really stop watching these thing.\r\nBut who cares I am here to see some romantic shit and I hope I get it.\r\nStory, 6/10 \r\nNow this is going to probably sound pretty generic but I going to tell why this isn't the problem.\r\nSo tale of memories is basically about these  2/half romances that are going on \r\nIn parallel with one another.\r\nSo I am going to brake and talk about a romances one at a time \r\nBecause both of them are somewhat different and handle things differently.\r\nSo the first oneI am going to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nIs about are main character for this part of the story at lest.\\n\r\nRenji who doesn't know what he wants to do in life and is kind of at a crossroad.\\n\r\nOne day while going to his favorite place to read he meets \\n\r\nA mysterious girls named chihiro who he starts to befriend  after seeing her again a few more times in the exact same place he meet her.\\n\r\nAfter awhile of them hangout  she reveals to him that because of an accident she had when she was 12 that \\n\r\n she only has 13 hours worth of memory a day.\\n\r\nAnd the only way she would actually remember renji \\n\r\nIs because she writes in a diary about what has been going on.\\n\r\nso after he hiars bout this he decides to still say buy her side anyway \\n\r\nSo basically after that they start developing a bond which one another.\\n\r\nWhile he helps her with her dream  of writing  a novel and  helps her see more of the world around her.\\n\r\nAnd over  time you can see this bond starts to grow stronger even though he forgets those moments.\\n\r\nLike for example there this one sene where she says to the renji \"oh we should kiss and he like oh why and she says well we known each over for a while now\" and I am like oh how sweet and endearing.\\n\r\nNow there was a few parts with some of drama that  felt like it was shoe horned in just the reason being we need some drama for this.\\n\r\nfor example her forgetting all about him and her memory re setting back to when she first had the accident because she tried to remember more than she Can handle with her trying to remembering more of the moments she has had with hiro.\\n\r\nwith in turn causing lots of psychological pain.\\n\r\nWhich was interesting even though it was kind of mellow dramatic \\n\r\nand  also the fact that she also ripped out all the pages from her diary. \\n\r\nBut in retrospect I can kind of see where it was coming from and it was coming  from but this seems quite forced. \\n\\n\\n\r\nNow the second one I am going to talk about \\n\r\nAre main character for this part hiro  Who is a professional mangaka who kind of dose things half assed in life.\\n\r\nSo One day while on his way to attend a Christmas  party.\\n\r\nHe comes across a girl named miyako who has been robbed and after a series of events ends up hanging  out with her for the entire night  and forgets the party that he was going to.\\n\r\nThat a childhood friend named kei who was also attending this party who he shares  a kind of bother and sister bond with. \\n\r\nSo after that he goes back to school its the usual shit. \\n\r\nHim working on his manga and Kai wakening him up in the morning. \\n\r\nAfter he goes to school The girl he had encountered on That night goes to his school and actually finds him and they start hanging out together.\\n\r\nBut of course them hanging out together is starting to make hiro childhood friend kei \\n\r\nJealous.\\n\r\nSo basically this becomes a love triangle story with all the usual shit you would find in story's like this.\\n\r\nYou know the back and forth between girls as the fight over him.\\n\r\nAnd a lot mallow drama which could have been solved a lot quicker if the main character hiro had actually done something and not just waste time.\\n\r\nEven though no one came up with the brilliant idea that they could both have him together but no  never mind you can't have two girls friends.\\n\\n\r\nAnd The other half that I was also talking about is pretty much just a background thing between this guy named kyosuke who likes to record things with a camera and is kind of into kei for reasons.\\n\r\nIt's not that important in retrospect. \\n\r\nBecause it background noise.\\n\r\nUsed to give Kai a some what happier ending. \\n\\n\r\nNow when I compare the romances together \\n\r\n I probably like the first one I mentioned between Renji and chihiro compared to hiro and miyako and Kai thing. \\n\r\nAnd when I think about it \\n\r\nIt's quite funny is that the people who have this more \\n\r\nFantastical  romance where the ones that had there relationship handled in a vary mature way. \\n\r\nBecause the main character renji like ok I got to take this slowly she doesn't remember and they have there relationship build it self up over time.\\n\r\nAnd in the other-one one girl is a complete psycho going like no he's mine and I will eased  you from his heart.  Even though  out of the two relationships.\\n\r\nthat was the one that was the most realistic even though it was kind of was handed in a very juvenile way.\\n\r\nBut at the same time and I don't like using this as an excuse.\\n\r\nbut they are kind of teenagers so in a way it's some what justified.\\n\\n\r\nNow one thing which is quite good about both of the relationships is that actually go somewhere and also the main characters also get to home base home run so yah props to them for doing that.\\n\\n\r\nA few negatives that I have with story in perticlar \\n\r\nIs that I wish that the pacing was a bit better because it some parts they did really rush it. \\n\r\nI think they could have fixed that if they had a few more episodes.\\n\r\nAnother problem I kind of had is that's even though this show has some pretty interesting psychological elements.\\n\r\nBut they never go into depth about it.\\n\r\nIt's like shit happens and then after two episodes they get over the problem. \\n\r\nI can see where they where coming from  but for It feels very one note.\\n\r\nBut when I think about and compare it to most rom-coms story's I have seen \\n\r\nIt was nice to see them try to go the extra mile even though they didn't explore it properly.\\n\r\nwell properly wouldn't be the word I would use it more lack of deepth I guess is the more accurate word I am looking for.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe two main protagonists renji and hiro\\n\r\nAre well interesting even though there personality are kind of generic.\\n\r\nAnd I think what makes both of them quite interesting is that they have some psychological issues which are brought up quite a few times.\\n\\n\r\nBut in retrospect it kind of looses its steam when your realize that the problem that  they are face are very one note by nature and it seems like the kind of problems that lots of people kind of face in there lives when there around the teenage years.\\n\\n\r\nSo there problems  are very relatable to quite a few people.\\n\\n\r\nBut when I also think about it the main girl characters at lest for this part.\\n\r\nKei and chihiro and miyako had a more interesting psychological issues.\\n\\n\r\nWhich probably weren't the most relatable but where probably the more interesting out of the two.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters at lest for this part.\\n\\n\r\nWhere ok most of them where pretty generic. \\n\r\nAnd some of them had hints of we also have some issues to it just we not going to show it yet.\\n\\n\r\nBut I must give credit to the fact that they use the normal stereotypes you would find in any show like this and adding something to them to make them more complex.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt, 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation looks very nice.\\n\r\nIt feels very clear and crip.\\n\r\nThe back ground look pretty nice as well.\\n\r\nThere also quite a nice color scheme.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is  very generic especially for v.n standards.\\n\r\nNow one thing I noticed and I will give it credit for is that they would change the look of the show in some scenes and they also add a lot visual symbolism  which adds some personally to the scenes.\\n\r\nFor example we may all the color gone in the show for about 5 sec in one scenes \\n\r\nOr we have something that looks  very trippy   and artsy as all hell.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design where pretty generic.\\n\r\nIt a v.n novel there nothing much to talk about.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe op song for me was quite nice to listen to it\\n\r\nIt has this relaxing feeling to it. At lest for me \\n\\n\r\nThe ending song didn't really stand out to me that much.\\n\r\nIt was just kind of there.\\n\\n\r\nThe ost in general is pretty forgetble.\\n\r\nBut it dose add a bit of atmosphere.\\n\r\nSo it kind of doing it job.\\n\r\nIt nothing special like there was never I time where I was like wow that sounds nice.\\n\r\nI want to listen to the full version of this.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nA few things which I quite liked about the show are.\\n\r\nWell for one it takes its self with the right amount of seriousness and the relationships where quite interesting to watch.\\n\r\nLike for what this did and when I compare it was to other v.n anime.\\n\r\nIt probably one of the better v.n anime out there.\\n\r\nBecause There was nothing really wrong with this show in a general sense.\\n\r\nLike there are a few things that really hindered my enjoyment.\\n\r\nLike some of the drama that comes up and I would have liked pacing to be better.\\n\r\nIt mostly nit picks.\\n\\n\r\nOverall. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNow if your a fan of v.n anime or romance story's in general.\\n\r\nThen check this out.\\n\r\nBecause for what it is it dose a pretty ok job.\\n\\n\r\nNow if your not into v.n anime or romance anime in general.\\n\r\nThen this will probably not convince you to change your mind and starts watching them.\\n\r\nbecause it still follow the very same formula   that you find very boring  Rey quickly especially if your an experienced anime fan. \\n",

In Ef, They are thought out and carefully organized and well done as well as that they aren't all the same so it makes them just that much better, Overall I rate this anime a 10 because of how much i loved the story,character, and Enjoyed it even in tell the bitter end when i know i don't want it to end but glad there is a season 2.",

            "content": "Let's start with two disclaimers. If you hate eroge-adapted-to romantic drama, you'll hate it; it's an eroge-adapted-to romantic drama. If you hate the works of Shaft, you'll hate it; it's very definitely a Shaft show.\r\nEssentially what you're watching is two very-tenuously linked (but with substantial parallels) melodramatic romances; one with just two people's problems getting in the way and the other triangular in nature. There is a certain element of \"broken girls and the relationships that save them\" that the cynic in me sneers at while trying to pretend he doesn't find it at all affecting. From all the blogging I've read on the showit looks like most people will find they prefer one side of the story to the other, which I did find to a slight extent (I'd never properly understood \"eyepatch moe\" before now) The ending is a long way from unexpected, but as ever it's the journey to it that's the worthwhile part.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I don't want to get too bogged down in describing what happens (go and watch it instead!), but what I really should comment on is the use of imagery in the show. I've always liked Shaft for how they're prepared to use animation as animation with dramatic changes of style, visual metaphors and the like, but in all the shows of theirs I've seen before it's either seemed like it's adding an extra level of comedy to the comedies (SZS or Pani Poni), or artistic whimsy to a slice-of-life show about whimsical artists (Hidamari Sketch). In a drama-ish show like this though, it really can add a different level of intensity to things. I especially loved the way a character's unwelcome memories were depicted with the picture breaking up and static in one episode.",

            "content": "Psychologically disturbing. \r\nAt first, I wasn't really attracted to this series. The first couple of episodes present many different characters and it gets a little confusing as where this is heading. It also makes it harder to get attached to them. The story is really withing the characters, especially Chihiro, as you get to explore her very special condition.\r\nPicture. \r\nThis is what got me to continue watching \"ef\". The art is simply amazing. The animation is smooth and very well detailed. The editing is unique and extremely original. Random transitions between scenes make it really entertaining. But the main emphasis is put on the picture.The characters are beautifully drawn, and a touch of detail is put to everything in the surrounding. The scenery always offers an unrealistically colorful sky. These pictures, added to such an awesome editing, makes it really worth watching. \\n\\n\r\nA tale of memories. \\n\r\nThis is one anime that will get you thinking. The later episodes leave you wondering inside your mind, putting you into deep thoughts about life and everything. Or about how weird it can get. This is undoubtedly a series that you won\u2019t be forgetting. \\n\\n\r\nBizarre. \\n\r\nDuring episode 7, when Hirono doesn\u2019t show up to their date, Miyako calls him and leaves voice messages. MANY messages. The voice acting during this part is also notable. Miyako goes through every single possible emotion, and the voice beautifully expresses it. As she speaks, there is a white screen which is filling up with text of every word said. Nothing but a white screen and black text, and it keeps on for 4 minutes, until the screen is entirely filled with black, and the episode ends like that. Really gets you saying \u201cwoah\u2026 that was seriously messed up\u201d. Probably an all-time favorite anime scene for me. \\n\\n\r\nMINI-SPOILER ALERT \\n\r\nThe ending is reaaaaally super cheesy! Every character gets his share of cheese...iness. It\u2019s still an ok ending, but I expected something more\u2026 disturbing. But, there is still the sequel, and I\u2019m \u201cef-ing\u201d looking forward to it!\\n",

And then came another problems which is too lazy to watch it . But , i gave it another shot and thank god i finish it .\r\nStory:8\r\nThe story plot sometimes confused me because once i thought it was about the past and the future kind of thing . It also make me think its about a two different world . Yet , it was simple than what i thought . The story isabout a group of different people who goes through their life with hardship like Chihiro . Won't say much because im just gonna ruin it for you .\\n\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\r\nThe arts and animation were nice . The were some animations that are 3D but not much . The arts a basic . Not enough to capture my interest .\\n\\n\r\nSound:7\\n\r\nThe voice actors and actress were good . Nothing that make me hate it or anything . I like Chihiro voice actress . Now , the OP and ED was soo good that i don't even see any OP or ED (beside the last episode that an ED was actually exist) at all . This is my first time really . I was surprised that they don't have any OP . Maybe they are trying a different kind of way . Or maybe they don't have enough material or something\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:9\\n\r\nAlmost all of the characters does have it background . starting Renji Asou , a teenager who live with his mother Sumire Asou . Then we have the womanizer Kuze Shuichi who were flirting with Renji's mother . (my god *facepalm*) Chihiro Shindou was the one i like the most . She has this sickness that after 13 hours , everything she knows will be erase . Like amnesia but in a timer way . She just soo kawaii . We also got Kei Shindou , Chihiro big sister . The most interesting character was Yuu Himura and Yuuko Amamiya . They have this mysterious aura on them . I guess they gonna be on Melodies and finally reveal what are their relationship\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8\\n\r\nThr first time i watch this , i didn't enjoy it much because of confused on the story . A second try and i did enjoy it just fine . There were comedy in it but only enough to make me giggles or grin . The drama however are overflow . Did make me cry a bit (like Chihiro problems and Kei hardship) Ef: A Tale of Memories is one of my memorable anime and Melodies could also be my memorable anime . Who knows....\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8\\n\r\nI will say this anime is good . The first till the last episodes were enjoyable . If you're into an more focus anime on drama , this one is for you .",

            "content": "So I just fished \"Ef: A Tale of Memories\" in one night, dam was it good.\r\nLet me start off by saying that the story in this anime was well done but at times a bit confusing at first to understand what was going on. When the show switches from the main two story lines (witch you'll come to know and love) witch is confusing at first. That's the only thing I really didn't like about this anime. The first 3 episodes I had no idea what was going on but it gets explained later on but still it might lose people just by that alone.I liked how the 2 stories are combined together by the littlest details. like the hole sister thing with Shindou Kei and Shindou Chihiro, on how they found love and how they all went to the same school except one of them. I do have to say (without giving anything away) I did like Chihiro story a lot better with Renji. Their story was more emotional and made me cry on episode 11. I felt their story was a lot more better because she has short term memory loss then the  love triangle \"thing' (i really don't know what to call it) that was going on with Hiro (the guy) who's falls in love with Miyako but at the same time Kei is in love with Hiro. Throw out the hole thing I did hate the livening guts out of Kei (not going to say why but you'll see if your like me) some might like her more but not me.\\n\\n\r\nI did like the different art style they choose for the anime. I liked it when in episode 1 when Hiro and Miyako are walking down the beach and you can only see the outline of them with everything around the is black while they are filled in with the back round. It's hard to explain but when you watch it you'll understand. They do this through out the hole show from time to time again and it sets a different tone.\\n\\n\r\nI liked this anime more the other romantic /drama animes. I felt like at time it felt a little rushed, but what could you do bout it right. Its a must watch if you love romantic animes. This wont make you cry waterfalls like other animes out there like \"Clannad\" but it might make you cry if you care about the characters enough. Like I said I did cry once but I fell like the average person would have cried about 2 to 3 times, it's a really good anime so watch it. ^_^\\n\\n\r\nDon't forget to hit that \"Helpful button\" if you found this helpful in any way so others can find this review. Don't be afraid to send me a message if you want to talk more about this anime or had any comments with my review. ^_^",

            "content": "Uhm, this one is a bit tough to review. The problem is, that this anime is composed by two stories, and while one of them is good, the other one is... well, somewhat bad. That's why I tought it was better to review each one on it's own merits. However, first I ought to say that the art and sound are great, animation is kind of artistical, the music fits perfectly with the story and the seyuu excell at their jobs. \r\nNow, I will begin with the \"good part\" of the story: Chihiro/Renji.\r\nThis is the story that Ef tells better. It's the story of acomplication standing in the way of the relationship between the two main characters, Asou Renji and Shindou Chihiro. It's a bittersweet story filled with symbolism, and I was pleasantly surprised. Even if I saw the ending coming from miles away, it was really well executed. I should say that the amount of symbolism in the story fitted the animation style much better then the \"bad part of the story\" (I will get to it).\\n\r\nChihiro and Renji are both extremely likeable characters, and the supporting cast does it's job in the right measure, without interfering too much in the main character's relationship. The story it's not without it's good share of flaws tho. The pace dragged out a bit, some of the emotional scenes were a bit off and, as I said before, the ending was predictable. Even with it's flaws, however, the last two episodes of the series, who focused exclusive on this storyline were by far the best ones in the show.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nNow, to the \"bad part\": Kei/Miyamura/Hirono\\n\\n\r\nMy main problem with this part is that it uses a extremely common trope in anime (SPOILER...........) \\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\nthe childhood friend missing the oportunity to get the guy because she didn't confess\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n(/SPOILER)\\n\r\nand it does not execute it better than most other series. In fact, I would call it's execution absolutely poor. I mean, why would I find this interesting even if I have dozens other shows doing the exact same thing, and doing it better? \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the character building here didn't made me feel sorry for none of the characters at the end. I actually hated the two main heroines to death. And Miyako's behavior at the last episode wasn't reallistic AT ALL. (you would know that if you ever got involved with an obsessive woman). It just felt tremendously poorly writen, and a \"shipping bait\" to people who are into this kind of thing, I particularlly wouldn't be able to ship between two obsessive crazy girls who would probably make the male main character's life a living hell in a relationship. I said that this anime didn't made me feel sorry for any character, well, I changed my mind, I feel very sorry for Hirono, none of the main heroines deserved him, altough he wasn't particularly well writen as well.\\n\r\nThe only thing this storyline did better than Chihiro/Reiji's one was the pacing, wich was actually very good, but even that didn't stop me to have an enourmous will to just jump it due to the lack of enjoyment.\\n\r\nHonestly, it feels like a waste to give such a lousy storyline and crappy characters this splendid art and music. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you want to watch this, watch it expecting one good story, altough flawed, and one bad. Well,  to be honest, if you manage to get emotionally invest in either Kei or Miyamura it would still be a crappy, poorly written story, but you may get more enjoyment from it than I did. I somewhat recommend this show, but if the Miyamura/Kei/Hirono thing starts to bother you, pass it without fear, as it won't get better.\\n\\n\r\nChihiro/Reiji - 7/10\\n\r\nMiyamura/Kei/Hirono - 4/10\\n\r\nOverall - 5,5. Turned to 6 as a bonus for the art and sound.",

            "content": "Have you ever watched something that you yearning for more? Well this anime in itself is like that. If you are in the mood for a romantic/drama well look no further, next to Clannad this anime is on the top of the list for me! It really is a amazing tale of stories, a little over the top emotionally how the girls in the story react for me to wrap my mind around but emotionally non a less! This anime got me all hyped up around the end how events were unfolding. I was arguing with my roommate about what was going on and frustrated,but that is a sign of a good story and plot! Enjoyed every second of it :D\\n\\n\r\nStory-10\\n\r\nIt was very addicting to watch, episodes fly one after the other and the plot between 6 or 7 characters inter-web is amazing. At first seeing all these relationship unfold and how people in the show can be overwhelming at first, but in the end of the first season everything is justified by the truth and what is going on. The plot is easy to comprehend and fun to watch and see the relationships come together.\\n\\n\r\nArt-10\\n\r\nEnticing, vivid, abstract. The color and color transition in this show is nothing more extraordinary. It caught my attention right away, the color scheme is beautiful and smartly done. The animation and artwork in this series is done perfectly. It really reminds me of the play hamlet that was done in present day New York filmed in the early 2000's. No not the plot and story but how it is filmed, the angles, the lighting, and transitions are very similar. It is a very beautiful anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound-8\\n\r\nI rated the sound the least, it didn't stand out to my senses like the other did but it wasn't horrible at all. There are times in the series that it really perfects it, but other times it seems cheesy to me more cliche. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters-9\\n\r\nThe Bond between the characters is exquisit. There are three main stories or potential relationships and the story and plot is wonderful. It will make you heart ache at times hearing the true story behind some of the female leads. There is a depression theme behind most of the female leads which is quite irritating but other than that it a perfect anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that bothers me that i don't give it a overall score of 10 is because of the over the trouble emotional struggles and how they cope with it. To be i'm just bewildered by it and its a knife in my back that keeps me from giving it a 10. But wow, this is really a amazing and beautiful anime all in all. This is really a must watch on any anime loving's list! \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading :D\\n\\n",

            "content": "There are some memories that shouldn't be let go, no matter what the circumstances may be. You choose your own path, and it will always be your own; something that others cannot influence or change.\r\nEf: A Tale of Memories. When I was first introduced to this series, I wasn't too sure what to expect. The first thing I thought was, \"Oh, it's just another romance anime.\" However, it is much, much more than that. The entire series is split into two simultaneous stories that are actually connected to each other, despite how different each part is. This was the first anime that I gave 10/10to in every category. It's not just that it was enjoyable and was presented well, but that the deeper meaning and messages in the anime really spoke to me. Watching it posed interesting (and often quite depressing) questions about my own life. What would I (or you) do if my memory only lasted thirteen hours? Watching Ef: A Tale of Memories has changed the way I view the world and might potentially affect choices I make in the future.\\n\\n\r\nEvaluation:\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\r\nThere is nothing to be said here. The stories present in Ef: A Tale of Memories are almost flawless. There is a delicate mixture of joy and a dark underlying tone of pain and suffering. I found this to be unlike any other storyline I've ever seen. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it immensely.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nOnce again, I found very little to complain about in terms of art and graphics. At first, I was a bit confused from the sort of mosaic scenes that came along every now and then, but as I delved deeper and deeper into the series, I realized how important they were to the story. Every character was drawn beautifully, and the landscape in general was quite amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nEf: A Tale of Memories has some of the most amazing musical pieces in it. The melodies of the intertwining instruments, filled with hope, sorrow, and joy, moved me completely. Though the anime itself didn't manage to make me cry (though it got VERY close several times), listening to the music brought tears to my eyes instantly. Even now, I listen to it whenever I want some peace and quiet.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe characters in Ef: A Tale of Memories can only be described as unique. The way they act, along with their personalities, makes them very much like a person you or I might meet in real life. In my opinion, this made the overall effect of the anime much deeper, since you could potentially relate to one character or another.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI have to say. I definitely enjoyed this anime a lot. It was deep, meaningful, and was able to change me as a person, though the change might be very small. Though not exactly a guiding force, there were places in Ef: A Tale of Memories that I could relate to, and such experiences might help me make tough decisions in the future. \\n\\n\r\nEf: A Tale of Memories is a definite must-watch for those of you looking for a serious love story that contains both happiness and sorrow. The writers of Ef have done an extraordinary job with the plot, as well as the personalities of the characters. Everything, in my opinion, was perfect. Perfect enough to call this anime a true masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\n\"If your memory only lasted 13 hours at a time, what would you do? What sort of path would you choose for yourself?\"\\n\r\n-Perhaps it's better not to choose, but to lie in wait for the day when someone comes along who will free you from the binds of such a restriction.-",

It is one of the first anime which is not a fighter anime i ever watched and it was fascinating for me to see how touching a story like this can be. To the story i have to say (without spoilering anything), that it consists basically out of 2 different main storys in 2 different cities. Normally i would stand critically against splitting it but in this case it made the story even better with all the ups and downs. The artis also very good. well but thats only my opinion you may think of it otherwise. One of the things i enjoyed most about this anime are the well developed characters and their backgrounds. In addition the music to each situation is just great and fits so well. Till now i only said good things about it so i will also tell you why its not a straight 10 for me. For me personally the story is ,if watch the anime the first time, developing a bit to fast and you may have to rewatch it to understand everything. There are also some scenes they could have made a bit compacter and better. But overall i have to say it is a really good anime and i can only recomend it to all people who like this kind of anime. I normally dont crie easy but i have to say when i watched it the first time i had to a couple of times. \\n\r\nPs: sorry for any english mistakes i made here and i hope you enjoy watching it :)\\n",

            "content": "My first review so go easy on me. lol\r\nFor a while I desired to see a good dramatic anime. Ever since I finished Kanon, Clannad and 5 Centimeters Per Second, other dramatic animes didn't affect me as much. That is until I stumbled upon \"ef\", a tale of memories indeed. From the Synopsis I had thought it was going to be one simple arc between one boy and other women connected with him; A harem as everyone says. I believe that ef is one of the most heart felt animes there is, especially in Chihiro's arc.\r\nStory: At first I was rather confused about who themain character was, watching on I finally understood what was going on. The story itself is quite magical in its own sense. It makes you ask yourself: &quot;Would I do that for that person?&quot; and the consequences for either decision would be grave and painful. In short, the story is just so moving, amazing and well thought out.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It was ef&rsquo;s art that attracted me to the anime first. It looked cute yet given a sense of mystery. I can say with confidence that the art in this anime is absolutely breath taking. The scenery and the types of animation used were simply stupendous. It makes this one of the most unique animes every created. This was a big influence as to why watching one part makes everything so magical, beautiful landscape and abstract and the next part it intentionally makes you shiver in fear as to what&rsquo;s going on in the plot. This section was a necessity to create such an amazing anime. It widens your eyes and with its beauty, it paints its canvas into your soul and so shall it remain.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening songs and ending songs were one of the many highlights to this anime. This must be the 60th time I&rsquo;ve listened to the intro song because it&rsquo;s such a nice song. Most of the music played within the anime as well was breath taking. With violins and pianos playing, there&rsquo;s no way one cannot feel emotions for most of the scenes. I&rsquo;m a big fan of violins and piano so maybe that&rsquo;s just bias on my part, either way. The music is just wonderful and I&rsquo;m going to listen to this song again another billion times.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters touched my soul, especially one of the main heroines, Chihiro. I also found Renji to be a great character as well, I like his personality. Most of the characters have their own traits and that's what makes this anime so great. From one point you see something funny from a character, and the next point you couldn't believe what they were doing, but that's life. That's reality. On other parts you ask yourself if you would be strong enough to live through the events to come if you realized you lost something that defines you as you, the main thing that makes you unique. Obviously I can't reveal it due to spoilers but this anime makes you think a lot if it happened for real.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Of course if you read my review you should know what I think about this anime. In short, I loved it. One of the greatest animes made in my personal opinion. If you're looking for a good dramatic anime, this one is good for it. Even though I wrote this review, even words cannot fully express the strong sense of feelings I felt towards this anime. I know it seems like I'm treating this anime like a god but still.. I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Perfect 10. Sure in reality there were maybe a few odd points, but in the majority it was simply brilliant. I'm so watching it again later. I hope you all enjoy it too as much as I did.",

            "content": "Please bear with this crappy review. I have little experience with romance Anime and no experience with writing reviews, so this will probably not the best or most informative review out here. \r\nAlso, ten years of English in school aren't enough.\r\nEf \u2013 A Tale of Memories is practically two bittersweet romances in one series. \r\nOne of the two is about Hiro who's biggest dream is to become a appreciated manga artist. He meets Miyako on Christmas Eve when she steals his bike.\r\nThe second story tells the story of Renji who meets a shy girl named Chihiro at an abandoned train station. \r\nThere's more behind thatbut I hate spoiling so this is all I want to tell. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI really loved how this Anime was animated. Seriously the style was awesome! \\n\r\nThere are small cuts between scenes with seemingly meaningless things or words displayed. \\n\r\nThey make no sense at first but they will fit perfectly as the story progresses. \\n\r\nThe animation is fluid and I liked the colouring. It really matched the story and managed to catch the vibe of the anime.\\n\r\nI'm not a fan of those big eyes, but this is only my personal opinion. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe soundtrack also matches the atmosphere of the show. It's not brash or flashy, more gentle and almost timid. \\n\r\nThe Opening was very nice too. \\n\r\nBut since it definitely is a good soundtrack there wasn't anything outstanding, so I will give it a 9.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nAs I said before, I'm not really experienced with romance Anime so I don't have anything to compare it to. \\n\r\nBut as far as I can say the story really captured me. And I'm quite sceptical when it comes to romance..  But really... I watched this in like 4 hours!\\n\r\nIt is a little bit confusing at first because you won't make out who belongs to which story but after the second episode the confusion fades and you have a very fascinating Anime. \\n\r\nThe pacing is good too, it isn't rushed but it isn't painfully slow either. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThere are people who liked the story about Hiro and Miyako and there are people who do not. \\n\r\nThe story itself was great too but Miyako's character didn't really managed to get me. \\n\r\nAlso, this is a personal opinion. She is not a bad character I just didn't liked her that much. \\n\r\nOtherwise the characters are portrait brilliantly. They have their flaws and their strong sides, like people are supposed to be. \\n\r\nYou will get attached to them really quickly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was a nice surprise for me to find out that I can like romance Anime too. \\n\r\nIt is outstanding in it's own way and really kinda cute so I give it a rating of:\\n\r\n9\\n\\n\r\nWell, this was my first review and I would be glad if someone would find it helpful. If it's not, please tell me why. \\n",

I liked, the non-linearity of history, what the events took place in the same city, and the heroes were aware of their existence, it was possible to feel a different kind of dimension of each of the stories depicted in this anime. 10/10\nI can not stick to the line because I likedit and it suited the world in which it was played. 7/10\\n\\n\nMusic, as same as art, really good, 7/10\\n\\n\nCharacters and here the fun begins, each character had something that was wrong, that I wanted to talk to, or something like that.

            "content": "Artsy, Creative, Sad, Happy. All in the same boat.\r\nWith three different characters storylines that have nothing to do with each other. You might think that the pacing or story is bad. Well, you are in luck my friend!\r\n[Story] 9/10 - Well paced and very well written, some dialogue was a bit sub par but it really didn't diverge from the message it was trying to push. Some scenes are so beautifully written, without spoiling anything I will give an example. There is one scene of a clock, ticking down slowly, with two characters talking over a phone. Choice of dialogue and the amazing use ofvisuals make the scene intense and wonderfully bittersweet. (I would love to see other shows do something creative like this in the future) If you are learning how to pace films or shows, this is a very good example. Balancing all three storylines. Ending each of them individually. \\n\\n\r\n[Art] 10/10 - ef: A Tale of Memories aired in Fall 2007, while the art is a bit a dated. It is still amazing to look at. Taking almost everything into detail when creating a scene. The Studio responsible for this is Shaft. You may of heard of their work on the Monogatari series. And their art style varies amazingly well over everything this studio has created! Even to the point that visual storytelling a key element in film is used almost all the time in this show. It may not be hard to spot, but it does such a wonderful job at conveying the scene's mood even further. Character expressions and movements can really make a scene better, especially if said character is upset.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound] 8/10 - Music choice can be a bit bad during some scenes, such as the one scene I mentioned earlier. If the clock made a ticking sound and they had the sound of the ocean or the sound of wind blowing softly, with no music and just those sounds. It would have made for such a better scene. Other than that the music is great, it fits the show. Both the OP and the ED.\\n\\n\r\n[Character] 8/10 - I'm surprised this show was able to pull off developing all of the characters due to the three storylines. But they did it! I'm amazed that every single character was fleshed out, had a backstory, an ending to their character arc, the relationships between the characters is amazing! Very well done! Applause all around for a show that accomplished such a feat... but this isn't a ten so why am I praising it like this? While the character development was done so well, the characters themselves were very predictable and gave really no surprise when a major thing happened to them. At least all of the male characters were very flat and all seemed alike in one way or another.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment] 7/10 - This is not a show to watch with friends, it's pacing is not for watching it over a weeks time. If you are to watch this show, make a time period where you can sit down and watch it all in one sitting. Most of this shows enjoyment, if not all of it. Comes from the interactions between the characters. But there is a significant amount of time where the main character speaks to themselves. These scenes can get a bit stale and boring pretty quickly. This is a very technical show as well, meaning it has a bunch of hidden elements most people wont find or understand unless you know the basics of film. Visual Storytelling is huge in this show, I would love to rattle off the many many occasions it uses it. But I don't want to spoil this.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall Score] 7/10 or 8/10 - At the time of this review Im rating it an 8/10 but this can change with even the most minor change of opinion. So If I could, this would most likely be a 7.5/10. It's not perfect, it's not amazing, it's not bad. It's in between good and great. \\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend this? Yes, check it out. The first few episodes are a bit boring but it picks up the pace pretty early on.\\n\\n\r\nIf today is your Birthday, Happy Birthday!\\n\r\nHave a wonderful rest of your day everyone!",

            "content": "Ef - A Tale of Memories is most likely a show that you won't forget for a long while. The plot is cliche and it's common, but the way the show presents it is very unique. The show follows two stories-- Chihiro, a girl with a memory defect, and Hirono, a manga artist who finally needs to make important choices in his life.\u00a0\r\nHowever, the anime isn't some happy-go-lucky show, but if you peel back the layers, it is actually very dark. The plot is simple, but the characters aren't. They have internal conflict, trauma, doubt, which is why it makes the anime so interesting. Ithas great character development throughout the show and touches on many issues that other slice-of-life or romance anime don't. The anime has an eerie sort of atmosphere to it and along with the art, it captures the seriousness of the situations. It is a show that will make you cry, yet you want to cheer the characters on to find their happy endings.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nPlot 8/10 - As said before, the plot is very simple and easy to follow. If anything, it's cliche. But the tone of the story makes the plot into something that's more than that. The plot is the accompaniment to the characters, who grow and learn throughout. Though not complex, it is still interesting to watch.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 10/10 - All of the characters have their flaws and all of them grow and develop throughout the entire story. We are told that the characters are in their early teens, but by the end of the story, they seem much older. The characters are deep and realistic, which makes them very relatable.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10 - The art is done very differently, but it has a good flow and artistic sense. It constantly switches back and forth between characters, has many light variations, and might seem confusing, but at the end, it fits the theme of the show very well. The art was what made Ef, Ef, and I really enjoyed seeing this unique style.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10 - Most of the time, if not all, the sound really complemented everything that was happening. From broken chords to chaotic sounds to peaceful ones, it reflected what the characters were feeling and what they were going through. It felt very dramatic and serious, which made the show more intense.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10 -\u00a0Ef - A Tale of Memories was a simple, yet great show. The characters were very well done and I loved how they did the animation. It did have its off episodes, but overall, I really enjoyed it and its an anime I won't forget watching.\u00a0",

            "content": "This is a show thats been berried in my \"to watch\" shows for far to long, so given the chance to bust out a show I decided, this would only take 4 hours, why not?\r\nEf: A tale of memories is an immensely powerful story about two concurrent love triangles surrounding students at a local High school. While I found the plot line incredibly simple, so much so a young child could follow, the emotional weight of this show is better geared for young adults. \r\nThis show was arguably one of the most depressing, heart wrenching, and involving shows I've seen, however, I wanted to keepwatching. I wanted to see it through to the end. \\n\\n\r\nThe strength of this story is the drama and the characters. The premises are simple, some moments were cliche, but the way each character thrives to find something lost, how they struggle, and hurt; it really hits you. Each character, from rival, to protagonist, by the end feels like they walked into the light, that they are genuine, kind and delicate. The show really does make you feel. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is unbalanced, as the Chihiro story is far more powerful than its competitor (also where the show received its name from) yet the way the stories intertwine make it a unique experience. The drama and music are also what gives this show such gravity.\\n\\n\r\nIf your looking for something easy to follow, that makes your stomach wrench, and your heart pound, I can honestly say this isn't a bad choice. It hurts, it tears you down, but the experience is one that will sit with me. \\n\\n\r\nI hope this review was helpful, good luck finding the show for you! Enjoy",

            "content": "ef - a tale of memories is one of my favorite anime of all time. It is simply a work of art. I stumbled upon it by accident, but I'm really glad I found it.\r\nThe story progressed on two, excelently detailed and paced roads. I actually preferred the Chihiro-Renji story, because the we truly got to see what Chihiro saw. The magnificent art also helped the storyline progress. There were lots of times when I teared up, when I couldn't stop smiling, and when i was shocked. It really was beautiful.\r\nThe concept of the Hiro-Miyako-Kei story was slightly clich\u00e9, but the was it was donewas outstanding: the art is, again notable, and we got to meet interesting characters.\\n\r\nThe bridge that connected these two storylines for me was the blue-haired girl, Yuko (we only find her name out in the end), who showed up if any character was depressed. But in a way, she has a story of her own too.\\n\r\nSo overall, although there are some parts in the anime that are left for us to figure out, overall, it was an amazing anime. I really think you should watch  it; this 12-epiisode anime is really worth your time.",

            "content": "(This is an edited version of the review I originally posted 12 weeks ago on Instagram. Also please note I have not played the original material for this show.)\r\nVisual novels seem to be the only visual based material that works being made into a anime, but the downside is that the adaptation most of time cannot fully adapt everything that was in the visual novel. However, what if there was an anime that could mostly adapt if not all the major plot points, and do it well?\r\nSTR #24: Ef: A Tale of Memories\r\nStory:\r\nThis one is a rather oddball. Instead of having one main story, itdecides to focus on two love stories at once. This typical sounds like a disaster waiting to happen, but this show wonderfully balances it out so well. The anime itself makes sure that each love story gets the right amount of time it needs to develop the characters and to have a real impact on the audience which can be credited to the cast of characters. Also, this story focuses a lot on the themes of memories and what they mean which makes the that much more compelling.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nWhile they can sometimes come off kind of predictable, the characters are what makes this anime be as great as it is. The drama the characters go through and present feels genuinely human. The audience feels the character's emotions of happiness, sadness, frustration, and joy throughout this entire show, and it really leaves an impact to make sure the audience will remember this show. But, if I did have one issue...it would be that sometimes the drama can get a little unbearable, but that rarely happened.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nThis has got to the best part of this show. You can tell Shaft had fun animating this, adding in their distinct touches that give the show more of it's own style to separate it from all the other anime based on visual novels.\\n\\n\r\nMusic:\\n\\n\r\nIt's absolutely beautiful, especially the opening themes. Most the stuff they do use for background music in the show is kind of forgettable, but it fits very well and is actually pretty relaxing too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime, and it is definitely worth your time to watch it.",

Instantly in episode one, I was drawn to the characters and the feelings that they similarly had. The emotional scenes hit hard, which is good, as that makes the scene more memorable. If the series was given more episodes to develop the characters more, I'm sure this story could have been a complete masterpiece, however, it was cut short due to its 12 episode length. That shouldn't turn you away from this anime however. I highly recommendit to anyone interested in romance and drama. The comedy is lightly played, the emotional scenes are well done, and the overall story is great enough for a 12 episode series. Give it a try, you will be sucked in by episode one.",

            "content": "The story to Ef - A Tale of Memories is a unique experience, don't go into watching this show thinking it will be a run of the mill romance story, it has one of the, if not the most, original stories you will likely come across in the genre.\r\nThe show is divided into two stories, in one we have a guy named Hiro who meets a girl named Miyako and they end up spending a lot of time together, this creates jealousy with Kei, Hiro's childhood friend and an intense love triangle is formed. The other story focuses on Renji and Chihiro, Chihiro has acondition that makes her forget everything that happened 13 hors ago, she keeps a log in her diary allowing her to recall moment, she and Renji form a close bond as he helps her realise her dream.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for this show is beutiful to say the least, you can really tell this is a Shaft project as they include so much of there defining characteristics, like there use of text on solid color scenes inserted into the show, they also have quite a lot of 'Photoshoped filter effects' scenes, and quite often silhouettes are used and many shot are styalized. Each character is drawn well and the background art is often very pretty, the show uses a lot of dark tones and rarely see the light of the miday sun as a lot takes place either at night or at sunset. Another thing i noticed but the characters often ended up talking to each other face to face but quite a few paces apart and the camera being pulled back so the background gets a lot of focus. The animation quality is great, everything is beautifully animated and rarely do we see incosistant animation and the use of CG was to the minimum.\\n\\n\r\nSound is another thing this show really makes wonderfull use of, the background music always did its job of enhancing certain scenes and making them stand out, the opening and endings were great, i lost track of them quite often because i swear they kept changing or switching from time to time but each one was a nice song, they mixed up a lot of styles as a harmonica is used then goes into a ballad, the opening was a cool pop rock song that used English lyrics that even had a Japanese version, every song was powerfull and had great feeling to them. All Seiyuu did their job spectacularlly and really gave feeling to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThere are five main characters to this show and are split 2-3, Renji is a boy who enjoys a good book and likes to read in quite places where he meets Chihiro, she has an illness that can cause a lot of trouble but her and Renji always pull threw there problems and help each decided and pursue there dreams. The other story has an emotional love triangle, Hiro is a Manga artist who often skips school and has a childhood friend, Kei, who tries to get him to keep coming back so he can get a good academic score, Hiro then meets a girl called Miyako, who has a fear of disappearing from the people shes close too, and he ends up spending Christmas with her and a lot of time after that, this love triangle included a lot of really emotional and powerful scenes like the voice messages, but then also had its clich\u00e9d moments that we see in plenty of other shows, such as the difference between sibling love and the romantic kind. The side characters are just as important, Yuuko and Himura appear to the different characters and often give them advice and assistance when required and act as people who they can go see, we also see including those two another guy who turn out to be the main protagonists for the sequel/prequel.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show is an emotional rollercoaster, there are moments that offer a little bit of comedy but it does focus on its drama. It is definitly one of the best in the romance genres and shood not be missed. Everything in the show, the art, the animation, the sound, everything comes together perfectly and really creates the mood of the show.",

            "content": "ef- a Tale of Memories is by far one of my favorite animes. It is beautiful in just about every aspect. It's everything I could ever ask for from an anime series.\r\nStory: The story revolves around two different love stories, connected only by two of the characters being twins. There's the story of unspoken childhood love that turns into a love triangle. Then, there's the story of a boy making a new friend only to find out that she has a memory defect that allows her only to remember the last 13 hours. I found the first story to be very cliche and at timesquite boring. But it did have a few aspects that made it unique and enjoyable. The second story was my favorite because it was so original, beautiful and quite emotional.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The animation in ef is beatiful beyond words. The character designs are perfect and detailed very precisely. Not a single in this anime is lacking any detail. It also does a good job of portraying the emotion the characters are feeling through many different aspects.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice actors did a fantastic job when it came to the emotional scenes. They did such a wonderful job, I was nearly in tears throughout most of the series. The opening fits the series so perfectly. For the first time, I actually watched the opening all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are very three-dimenstional and unique. They each develope at a nicepace throughout the series. I found them to be all unique and very ejoyable, although sometimes I just wanted to knock their face in. But that's all a part of bein a good character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I definitely enjoyed this anime. Each week I waited on pins and needles for the next episode to air. While I found Kei's story to be pretty enjoyable, Chihiro's was definitely my favorite and sadness story. She had to face the same hardships and deal with her illness.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys romance and anime and can appreciate beautiful animation and wonderful storyline.",

The story itself is best described as 'true slice-of-life' in that it presentsthe viewer with the day to day lives of two characters placed in unique circumstances. One has just met an amnesic girl and the other is an aspiring mangaka.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is not for those expecting the same general story told in a different fashion and is instead meant for viewers looking for an entirely different style of story-telling. It's meticulously written plot and well-rounded characters combine to become a truly unique series for those willing to take a step back from their presumptions on what an anime series should be.",

            "content": "Ef - a Tale of Memories is an amazing, beautiful anime no matter how you look at it. It's unique in so many ways, and is a fascinating anime that, surprisingly, should be more well-known.\r\nAt only twelve episodes, you would think that you wouldn't get much story out of it, and everything would happen too quickly. But so much is packed into each twenty-four minute episode that it feels like so much more. Sure, it's tightly plotted. But is it rushed? Not the tiniest bit. No event seems to fly by at all. And if it's long, there's a reason for it. The story itselfis outstanding. The story is that of a unique romantic drama, and the problems in here aren't just simple everyday things that people can solve if they get together and talk. Particularly the storyline with Hirono and Chihiro. Because of Chihiro's condition, she gets along awkwardly with him. Every new twist to the story adds to the tension and excitement, all building up to a beautiful ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation. The animation, the animation. Don't even get me started. The animation is the most beautiful animation I have ever seen in any anime, and is some of the most stylized, too. The opening is animated entirely in flat colors, which give it a strange but appealing look. Text, from Chihiro's book, flies by in the background and also adds something interesting. Even more techniques are used in the anime itself. The background can be seen through the characters when they're silhouetted against black, the color is rich and detailed, and the characters are drawn in a somewhat different style.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening music is great. Interestingly enough, for the first eleven episodes, it's in English, and in Japanese during episode twelve. There are several ending songs, each used interchangeably, all of which are also good songs. I have no objections to the music.\\n\\n\r\nef stands for any of the following: Euphoric Field, Ever Forever, Ebullient Future, or Eternal Feather.\\n\\n\r\nAn absolutely must-watch anime.",

            "content": "Society consists of visionaries, cynics, romantics and those who are just pitifully indecisive. Every individual has an idiosyncratic perception of life that has been derived from their own experiences. Each member of society, regardless of their social position, age or occupation, is a remarkably complex entity that has many peculiar dimensions. \u201cEf: A Tale of Memories\u201d exceptionally portrays this reality by intertwining a cast of relatable and flawed characters with an exquisitely crafted narrative that will enthral the viewer. It may not be the most popular of series but that is the case with many strokes of genius that ultimately achieve greatness through theirdistinctive profundity. \u201cEf: A Tale of Memories\u201d is a masterpiece that transcends the clich\u00e9d conventions that are synonymous with modern anime. By brutally dismissing any ventures towards fantasy and opting for a pragmatic narrative that elegantly elicits a multitude of emotions in the form of melancholy, laughter and sheer contentment, the series establishes itself as a true chef-d'oeuvre.\\n\\n\r\n The narrative portrays two parallel and separate plotlines that are occurring simultaneously, both of which are skilfully presented. Renji Asou, the protagonist of the first story, is a voracious reader of books who lacks ambition and also appears to have a dearth of friends. Fate has a tendency to precipitate the most defining and transformative of encounters. Such a turn of events ravels before Renji as he meets a shy and frail girl by the name of Chihiro Shindou at an abandoned train station; setting the foundation for the poignant mixture of tragedy and elation that the series so fittingly utilises.  As the friendship between the two intensifies, Renji learns that Chihiro had been in a devastating car accident years ago which left her with a tragic memory defect: her memory only lasts for a period of thirteen hours. After learning that Chihiro\u2019s principle ambition is to write a novel, Renji decides to help his friend fulfil her dream and also benevolently attempts to help her overcome the difficulties imposed by her condition. This storyline is coruscating in that it is the archetypal emotional rollercoaster that touches one\u2019s heart by provoking pity and poignancy through a narrative that is ultimately uplifting. \\n\\n\r\n The second plotline, the one centred on the chronically indecisive and confused Hiro Hirono, is the weaker story since it generally conforms to the conventions of a tragic romance and hence, lacks the idiosyncrasies of Renji\u2019s arc. Hiro Hirono, a talented manga artist, meets an intriguing girl by the name of Miyako Miyamura on Christmas Eve and when he realises that she attends the same school as him, an increasingly intimate relationship ensues. As one would expect from a traditional romantic narrative, it is later revealed that Kei Shindou- Hiro\u2019s childhood friend who has held a crush on him for long time- has become jealous and a typical love triangle manifests itself. This storyline accurately explores the more common relationships of life as Hiro struggles to reconcile his love for Miyako and his friendship with Kei; at the same time his efforts to balance his academic life with his career as a manga artist tend to be hopelessly fruitless. A major strength of this plotline is that it is markedly realistic and pragmatic in that it avoids the overly dramatic aspects of Renji\u2019s story- Hiro\u2019s trials and tribulations are purely relatable. Whilst Hiro\u2019s story lacks the complexities that are a defining feature of Renji and Chihiro\u2019s storyline, it is thoroughly relatable which creates drama that is at times immensely compelling. Hence, the two concurrent stories coalesce to give birth to a thought- provoking and emotion- eliciting masterpiece that presents believable characters that the viewer will be warmly attached to. The intimacy that the producers establish between the viewer and the characters is perhaps the most impressive aspect of an elegant series that lacks flaws.\\n\\n\r\n The characters are reflective of the individuals one encounters in everyday life and this accurate representation of society places relatability at the heart of \u201cEf: A Tale of Memories\u201d. Renji is initially depicted as a reserved and uninteresting individual who lacks any recognisable friends; he is devoid of clear ambition about what he wants from life which is a common feeling within adolescents and such a portrayal of Renji immediately attracts the viewer to this character. As the story progresses, Renji gains a true friend in Chihiro and as he helps her write a novel, he becomes more knowledgeable about himself as an individual. By witnessing Chihiro\u2019s immensely tragic circumstances he becomes more appreciative of life in general as his compassionate and introspective side glitters. Chihiro is also a complex character who faces many problems as a result of her memory defect which prevents her from attending school and forming friendships. The confidence she acquires through her encounters with Renji is heartening and the strides that she makes as an individual are bolstering since the triumph of a person\u2019s spirit over their adversity is beautifully portrayed. Hiro is at first sight the quintessential exponent of indecisiveness and disorientation as he struggles with both his personal and working life. Eventually, Hiro begins to shatter the shackles of tentativeness and is able to assuage the conflict between his love for Miyako and his friendship with Kei. This transformation demonstrates how potentially damaging mind-sets can be eradicated and that through meaningful introspection, one can truly harness an ordered view of life that is bereft of confusion. The character development that takes place over the course of the series is exceptional through its accurate reflection of human beings in general. The supporting cast, which includes the mysteriously inner-directed Yuu Himura and the hard- working Kyosuke Tsutsumi, provides plenty of diversity to the series and ensures that the viewer will almost certainly find at least a fragment of themselves in the series. \\n\\n\r\n The pulchritudinous artwork distinguishes \u201cEf: A Tale of Memories\u201d from other anime series as the viewer is given the pleasure of witnessing a visual tour de force with few equals. Many colour contrasts, silhouettes, angles from which the characters are shown and background abstractions are utilised to give rise to a series with a singularly stylish presentation. The soundtrack is masterful in that it exquisitely accompanies the more riveting and significant aspects of the series to ensure that they are cemented within the viewer\u2019s memories. \\n\\n\r\n The meticulous attention to detail that the series \u201cEf: A Tale of Memories\u201d placed in presenting the story, crafting the artwork and depicting richly pragmatic characters is commendable in that it has given rise to an entity with few flaws.  It is the accuracy of its depiction of human beings that enables this series to supersede convention and establish itself as a singular and distinctive series that serves as a recognisable benchmark for future anime. \\n",

And what happened in the past? There is also a 'story in the story' by the character Chihiro and I loved it! It goes as: The girl was the only one in the world. That made her the god of that world.'\r\nThe setting is really nice, like the sky, the beach, and the empty train station where Chihiro and Renji meets.

Another female character, Miyako, is also lonely and struggles to have a bond with the right guy. The third lead, Kei is also interested in the same guy and also has a relation with Chihiro.\\n\\n\r\nIt's an anime based on an ero-game but I think it turned out well!",

            "content": "\"There are no miracles in this world. There are only accidents, inevitabilities, and what one is going to do. That is it.\" - Himura Y\u016b\r\nThis anime (including the sequel) is far and away my favorite, and I have long since searched for another that could even come close to this great series, but to no avail. Although it is based on an adult visual novel game, entitled Ef - A Fairy Tale of the Two, there is no fan-service whatsoever in the anime version, which is normally my basic ingredient. Unfortunately, there is a fantasy element, albeit small, in this serious, romantic story, which ismore noticeable in Ef - A Tale of Melodies.\\n\\n\r\nThe mere fact that the story unusually focuses on three couples equally means the viewer is bound to have a favorite. They are all connected one way or another, and the viewer should note that some of the characters live in a twin city in Australia (the other one is in Japan), also called Otowa (not to be confused with Ottowa, Ontario, Canada).\\n\\n\r\nWhat is truly wonderful about this masterpiece is that the storyline concentrates on the internal struggles of the six main characters as they try to discover what is it they want to do in life, what is their dream, all while trying to balance their school lives, romantic relationships, and for one of them, even his job as a sh\u014djo (manga directed towards young girls) mangaka (manga artist). To add to this, love triangles play an important in the story, which causes more confusion and drama.\\n\\n\r\nMain characters' background:\\n\\n\r\n- Hirono Hiro: a boy who used to not know the feeling of being with others, and liked to draw alone, until one day meeting with twin sisters Shind\u014d Kei and Shind\u014d Chihiro. Kei introduced him to sh\u014djo manga through her collection, making Hiro intrigued about it, wanting to sketch his own materials, but lacking a storyline. Chihiro helped in that regard, since she liked to write stories, which made her oneechan, Kei, feel left out. After he grew up, Hiro wanted to pursue a career as a mangaka, but met with objection from his father, despite being an artist himself, which forced the former to leave home and rent a friend's apartment for almost nothing. Hirono then supported himself though his job as a sh\u014djo manga author, under the pseudonym Shind\u014d Nagi (composed of his childhood friend's family name and his older sister's (who studies in America) given name), while still attending high school. Due to his work constraints, Hiro often skips class or is late for school, causing Kei to come wake him up in the morning and lecture him. He likes to use the school rooftop key, provided by his sister, to go and sit there quietly during school hours, sometimes working on his art. Also, Hiro is a fan of famous violinist Kuze Sh\u016bichi and has had a very bad experience eating Kei's cooking.\\n\\n\r\n- Miyamura Miyako: one day, sound vanished from her house, as Miyako's parents' anger towards each other was directed at her, making her feel as if she had disappeared from their hearts. Thus, it has become very hard for her to open up to anyone. Though she often skips class, thinking that school is boring, she is popular among boys for being pretty, receiving high grades, and being good at sports. She also has a bad reputation for not answering her teacher in class when called upon in addition to ditching school.\\n\\n\r\n- Tsutsumi Kyousuke: a member of the films studies club. He lost his mother when he was younger, who was an actress and encouraged him to follow his dream. Kyousuke is dating the club president. Often filming with his video camera while walking around, he disagrees with his colleagues' (and Hiro's) view that production should be made to meet the audience's expectations, in order to win the film festival, whereas Tsutsumi believes in capturing what he wants, without being bounded by others. He is Hirono's classmate and good friend, but does not know about the latter's job.\\n\\n\r\n- Shind\u014d Kei: Hiro's kouhai who refers to him as \"oniichan.\" Always playing with her twin sister, Chihiro, she did not know the feeling of being alone before meeting Hirono. She introduced to him to her shoujo manga collection. Kei often texts her little sister, mostly rating food they have eaten throughout the day out of ten, since they came to live in different cities. She likes Hiro, but does not feel she has the right to confess to him, due to an incident that happened in the past. She, however, treats him like his little sister, coming to wake him up, lecturing him, and sometimes cooking for him, much to his dismay. She is a very good, popular member of the basketball team, in spite of being a freshman. Shind\u014d is very respected and admired by Hayama Mizuki, who calls the former \"senpai,\" though they are in the same year.\\n\\n\r\n- Asou Renji: a high school student who wonders what he should do when he grows up. Renji is good at cooking and likes to carry a book with him to read wherever he goes. He and his mother, Asou Sumire, are close to their neighbor, violinist Kuze Sh\u016bichi, who left a while ago. Sh\u016bichi is a womanizer who likes to make moves on Sumire, despite the fact that she is married, angering Renji.\\n\\n\r\nShind\u014d Chihiro: she used to play a lot with Hiro and Kei, but, due to a certain incident, she had to leave to another place. Chihiro and her twin sister text each other many times, mostly what they ate throughout the day, rating the food out of ten. Shind\u014d likes to write novels, but because of her condition, she has yet to complete her first one. Not liking crowded areas, nor being allowed to interact with other people, Chihiro likes to go to the empty train station, staring at the sky when she is about to cry. She is taken care of by Himura Y\u016b.\\n\\n\r\n- Amamiya Y\u016bko: a mysterious woman who is always at the church, waiting for someone, similarly to Y\u016b. Appearing and disappearing out of nowhere, she helps the children in their quest for finding what they are looking for.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a true joy to see the male protagonists try to uncover the hidden feelings as well as pasts of the respective heroines, and then help them overcome their issues and sorrow, while at the same time, seeking their own selves. This is portrayed beautifully in the opening sequence, where the girls look lonely, waiting to be saved.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the opening sequence, it is a wonderful piece with a catchy English song, except for the last episode, which contains the same tune and almost the same visual effects, but in Japanese instead. The backs of the male leads are shown in the beginning, then the three girls continue appearing repeatedly, with a lot of text contrasting on the screen \u2014 the novel Shind\u014d Chihiro, one of the main characters, writes in the anime; lastly, Amamiya Y\u016bko prays before a lying Shind\u014d Chihiro. In addition, before some episodes, there is an intense introduction before the opening sequence.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the opening, the ending sequence changes frequently, fitting one, or all of the heroines in most of them. They are nice songs that are appropriate for a current situation in an episode, and the lyrics of them are in Japanese. My favorite is the one in the final episode, and next to that is the one about Shind\u014d Chihiro \u2014 visually though, I liked Shind\u014d Kei's (her older twin sister's) version, as it is dramatic, showing her sadly running. Sometimes there is a small scene after the ending sequence, showing exciting moments that are to be continued. Moreover, at the very end of every episode, except for the last one, a sketch of one of the female characters is displayed, and one of the cast narrates a few words of wisdom, before saying the next episode's title and the name of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOn the subject of visuals, anyone who has watched Ef - A Tale of Memories. (or its sequel) will tell you that it is a feast for the eyes. By that, I do not only mean the amazing art and character design, but the difficult-to-find visual effects throughout the episodes, which consist of wonderful contrasting colors at times; text appearing on-screen to emphasize important words and sentences; superb portrayals of emotional status; constantly changing camera angles that make it hard for the viewer to be bored; as well as outstanding sound effects accompanying them, among many others.\\n\\n\r\nSeiy\u016b-wise (voice actor-wise), though I would change As\u014d Renji, Shind\u014d Chihiro, and maybe Amamiya Y\u016bko's, the other ones are just perfect. From Miyamura Miyako's cuteness, to Hayama Mizuki's naive personality, to Himura Y\u016b's calm seriousness, to Kuze Sh\u016bichi's friendliness, all the way to Tsutsumi Ky\u014dsuke's teasing ways, the seiy\u016b do an extremely marvelous job in presenting them. Not that the other ones are not good, after all, they do fit the other characters in a way, but they are not voices I want to keep hearing. Come to think of it, I might have changed Hayama Mizuki's seiy\u016b as well.\\n\\n\r\nBack on the story, during the characters' path to self-discovery, two mysterious individuals, named Himura Y\u016b and Amamiya Y\u016bko, who are always waiting in a church for someone, give them advice on what they should do, and listen to them. Strangely enough, they both claim to not be related to the church, nor even be Christians. However, these two are the real jigsaw in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, some shows require a few episodes to draw you in, this series requires only one. By missing this gem, you would be missing anime's best. I believe that most other reviews are for this series, too (giving it above five).",

Her \"ephemeral memory\" was obnoxious, his personality was practically nonexistent (so why care about him?), and the pseudo-intellectual waxing combined with the overly ambitious art made the whole arc come off as pretentious. The writer pollutes the dialogue in this arc with painfully-obvious metaphors and symbolism, seemingly with the intent to prevent any viewer from having the chance tofigure out anything for themselves. Supporting characters in this storyline aren't very helpful either as they needlessly spew deepities and other faux-wisdom. Was the writer channeling their belief or message trhough those side characters, or did the writer intentionally write said characters to be useless and unhelpful? I'm not willing to watch the show a second time to find out.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the show is good and seems surprisingly normal. Not amazing, but watchable. It's just the Renji-Chihiro side story that really killed the experience for me.",

On Christmas Eve, Hirono Hiro meets a girl named Miyamura Miyako who was chasing a purse snatcher. Hiro later finds out that Miyako also goes to the same school as he does and they start hanging out together. This made Hiro's childhood friend, Shindou Kei, feel left out. Kei then tries to compete with Miyako for Hiro's affection and a love triangle ensues. The anime also tells the story of Asou Renji. Renji meets a girl named Shindou Chihiro at anabandoned train station. He soon learns that Chihiro suffers from a type of amnesia where her memory span only lasts for 13 hours. He also discovers Chihiro's dream of writing a novel, but she has never been able to fulfill that dream due to her condition. Renji then decides to help her fulfill that dream.\\n\r\n(From Anime News Network)\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Opinion\\n\r\nEvery once in a while a show comes along that restores your faith in a certain genre.  &quot;ef ~a tale of memories~&quot; did that for me.  It single-handidly restore my faith and reminded me of why I like romance animes sooo much.\\n\r\nSo upon first glance of the images, it looked to be another slow moving romance harem drama.  So, i was expecting something like Love Hina, or Da Capo which spent more time concentrating on irrelevant material rather then the main romance.\\n\r\nBOY was i wrong.\\n\r\nFirst and foremost... ef is INCREDIBLY stylistic.  One glance at the sky in the show and you get goosebumps.  This was probably the most unique aspect of the show and one of the most appealing.\\n\r\n2nd... the romances in ef are absolutely amazing.  There's no way that you can be upset over the final pairings.\\n\r\nFinally... all the characters are all really well developed and you really care about them.. when they're happy, you're happy. When they're in pain... you're in pain.\\n\\n\r\nI really can't find one bad thing about this anime. I mean it's blown out all the other animes i've seen (yes, including Eureka Seven and Gurren Lagann). \\n\\n\r\nI'm stopping myself from giving anything over the max rating... but i totally would if i could.\\n\r\n10/10 (and it's pushing the limit)\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to...\\n\r\n- Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei\\n\r\nI haven't reviewed this one yet... but the stylistic approaches are quite similar and they're both made by the same production company\\n\\n\r\n- Neon Genesis Evangelion\\n\r\nYou know those mind-rape moments in NGE? when text would randomly appear on the screen w/ no real relevance.  Well there are moments like that in ef... albeit... they're a lot friendlier w/ your brain and you can actually comprehend what's going on.\\n\\n\r\n- This Ugly Yet Beautiful World\\n\r\nBoth are quite beautiful w/ multiple lead girls. Though in ef the girls are less connected\\n\\n\r\n- Kanon/Clannad\\n\r\nMusic, style, mystery elements are shared in all of them",

The feels this show gives you is unrivaled in my opinion. The Art style and character design is also one of my favorites so far. I specifically like the character design for Renji and Chihiro.\r\nOverall this Anime in Definitely in my top 3 anime if not first. Theonly anime making it only possible first is Clannad, because i cannot choose a favorite between the two.\\n\\n\r\nI would highly recommend this anime if you enjoy anime's with romance.

I can count on one hand the number of anime, or better yet, any sort of entertainment, that have made me cry.\r\nef - a tale of memories is chief among them, and I still cannot entirely figure out why. It's an exceptional anime by all standard conventions, but what exactly sets it atop other outstanding series remains elusive.\r\nThe thing for me that has always made for an incredibly enjoyable experience, is having identifiable and genuine characters. There's a wide enough range of personalities that most peoplewill be able to find someone to identify with; and every single character feels real, in a way that very little has been able to equal. Again Clannad comes to mind, I feel very comfortable saying if you enjoyed that, then you'll definitely like ef enormously.\\n\\n\r\nThere was some amazing cinematography in a few of the scenes, that just goes that much further in reinforcing the strong events taking place. Occasionally it will forgo the usual anime style and go for a bit more of a simple drawing as if you were looking at a piece of paper, with the pictures upon it in motion.\\n\\n\r\nIf by this point you're not convinced, just go ahead and give it a watch anyway.",

            "content": "Although not as big as some other series like Clannad, ef is definitely a prestigious and well-known title. Well, does ef deserve this? For the first season, my answer is 'yes'. But before I justify my point, I want to talk about some negative sides about this show. \r\nIf you summarize story of ef in a few sentences, you'll probably find the plot pretty ordinary and boring. Indeed, in terms of 'solid events', both stories in ef are not special, especially in an era like now. For example, the original idea of Chihiro's story might be new 8 years ago, but they are not now.(To avoid spoilers I won't say too much.) \\n\r\nAnother drawback is its 1st episode. Personally I found it pretty confusing, introducing multiple characters (all of them are main characters) at same time. Two male leads (Renji and Hirono) are especially confusing. Bear in mind that you distinguish clearly between them. \\n\r\nDespite these, this show does a really good job in visual representation. ef is made by Shaft, famous for its dramatic depiction of backgrounds and stationary texts. \\n\r\nHere in ef this style is used well, and adds greatly to the main story. A prominent example of this is in Miyako's story, which has the most heart-wrenching scene I've seen in all animes. \\n\r\nBut what truly shines is Chihiro's story. Although the idea is not new, there is a very powerful, aesthetic story associated with the main plot, much like a greatly enriched version of Clannad's lonely girl. This pattern, from what I've seen, is unique, and makes that story very enjoyable, even in a literary sense. \\n\r\nArt quality of this show is no doubt superb. The Shaft style is not overly excessive as in Bakemonogatari, but adds properly to the general feel. The music is also good and fits each scenes pretty well, but not very impressive imo. \\n\r\nef is a character driven anime, and it successfully produces many vivid and plausible characters. Each character interacts with others and grows themselves, and their dialogues don't seem artificial. \\n\r\nWith all said, ef is a very well-made anime, and certainly one of the best in its genre. For fans of emotional stories or romance, ef is definitely a must-watch.",

            "content": "This is the kind of anime that many will see for the almost poetic feeling of it or for the great art performance that is outstanding for sure.\r\nI would say there's even a third reason for watching it.\r\nThe hidden message behind.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThe story is not only one story, but two stories in parallel. Many have probably known the physical link between the two stories. (Easy, one word, Twin.)\r\nThere's also a psychological link. (This one, I'm sure, not many have seen it)\r\nWe know by the synopsis that Chiiro has a short term memory lost problem. That make her truly lonely and it's making her very sad.\r\nMaycontain little spoiler\\n\r\n{\\n\r\nOn the parallel story, Miyako seem all happy and full of life, but later in the story, we understand that she's at least even more depressed than Chiiro that has a physical problem. Miyako is unhappy because of the fact that all her life, she has been living all by herself.\\n\r\n}\\n\r\nNow, the two seems to feel exactly the same way, but one is because of a physical problem, the other only psychological. \\n\r\nI have just explained what is the hidden message I was talking about. This story isn't for the emotional factor, but for the simple purpose of comparing someone that was obliged to live alone and someone that not remember the one she lived with. In the end, the two characters feel exactly the same and is proof that being alone can be similar of having no memory at all.\\n\r\nBefore the show, I never thought about that, and when I was able to make this psychological link between the two stories, I was totally convinced of this psychological theory. This is exactly why I thought this was not only very good.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nOne of the better performance in an anime for sure, what beat this is the second season. Weird angles but always accurate, special effects, form in the view, view by mirror, those entire characteristic makes for a truly poetic and artistic atmosphere. Something I never see anywhere else... (Besides rare movies)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nWe have a great op song. The translated version and the original are equally good. The voice acting is superb, not has quite genius like some others, but still way up there with the best. What I mean is the fact the character has a voice that fit their own kind of emotion and feeling.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nThe character are nothing exceptional but are very good, the fact that they are acting normally and they have a certain evolution help the scenario a lot. For examples that the character are acting without excess I will cite some events.  The whole part where Renji try to write a story with Chiiro is quite introspective of what Chiiro is truly feeling. Remember what\u2019ve told you, if that\u2019s the way Chiiro is feeling, Miyako isn\u2019t well far from this too.  Kyosuke is maybe the other character worth mentioning. He starts the series like a borderline pervert, but soon enough, we will know that it was not perversion that was his motive, he is serious about her. (Won\u2019t say who) He will help her with his own method but will actually succeed in helping her. \\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment really depend if you get it or not, I was myself only giving maybe a 7 or an 8 after some episode, and at the exact moment I saw the comparison I was talking about. I have changed my mind. I have tough to myself: \u201cOK, this anime isn\u2019t actually something to watch for an emotional ride, but more for a feel for something poetic, and maybe a tough you never have before.\u201d It was the case for me, and if it\u2019s yours, then, you will like it like me.\\n",

In the beginning it was for me a little bit confusing but after seen some episodes i have really gotten in to the story. They did a great job of building in the tention in every single episode!\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nI really love the arts in the anime, and they have done a great job in especcialy the characters and the backgrounds. I also love the way they use colors to make the story even better I am not a fan of bright collors, so I am pleased to see that they have used darker but lovley colors in it :D\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nI loved the sound froum the first note in the first episode of the anime. The use of sound in this anime is one i have never seen up till now. They did a excelent job in using the sounds in building up the emotions and they did not lack on the use of sounds, i am in love with the composer of the music in this case Tenmon and Eiichiro. It often gave me tears in my eyes!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nI can't say that i was blown away by any of the Characters, but each one of them tells a great deal to the story. They all know loss, love and various kinds of emotions, especcialy the main chara's of the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI can't really call it enjoyment, but i have experienced so many emotions in this anime, i had laughter, tears and agony. The anime sucks you right in to it, so i can say that it enjoyed me!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nI really loved the anime, the arts and the sounds. so overall it has a 10 out of 10. If you love a slice of Life, Drama anime with a great story building up and beautiful arts in the chara's and the backgrounds, then you will love EF - A tale of Memories.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this, now i'd grab my tissue box and enjoy mu re-watch!\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ef a tale of memories was a show that I thought I would never finish. Watching this show was like riding the Rock 'n Rollercoaster at Disneyworld. \r\nAfter waiting in a line that moves as fast as the sun, you are launched into a tunnel of darkness and a nanosecond passes, and you wonder why it ended so soon.After Ef was over, I couldn't believe how much of the series I watched without noticing and like that rollercoaster, while it was going, i did not want it to stop.\r\nEf a tale of memories is... well a tale of memories. It's like three different stories combinedinto one and each is involved more or less with one another. The one central story,starring Chihiro , is were the memories part sets in . After an accident, Chihiro Shindou suffers from a disorder that erases her memories every 13 hours. Renji meets her and the two together make a adorable couple, but he's warned about Chihiro to stay away from her and at times he should have heeded that warning.Regardless without Renji, Chihiro would have been worse off. The other stories revolve around Chihiro's sister Kei and another character, Miyako, in a story correlating to the lyrics of Avril Lavigne's\"Girlfriend\"only way more intense.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was one color to describe this show it would be BLUE. There's a variety of different blue hues and shadows more through the show than not. The art of this show is shiny and filled to the brim with gradients.The production studio,SHAFT, does it again by providing artsy fartsy shots and scenes when the mood requires it. This brings many brilliant parts of the show that can make into a stunning desktop wallpaper. In the case of animation, there is no cool fight scene or fluid character movement(with the exception of the opening and endings)  because it's not needed.The art and visual aesthetic make up for it. The most remarkable part of animation I can recall is the flowing hair.\\n\r\nThe opening is beautiful and can be catchy even only for minute, The two of the three endings songs compared to their visuals are that rememberable but the third ending sounds so unique and the visuals add onto it making it a sight for sore eyes.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters, there is some unbalance.This mainly goes for one character,Kei Shindou. Throughout the series, she berates Miyako for befriending Hiro and she doesn't deserve it. Miyako has had such a depressing childhood and the worst thing arguably to happen to Kei was that she gets a broken leg and that's it.So that was the only major problem I had.\\n\r\nI thought Ef would be refined to the point of boredom but Ef had surprising moments \\n\r\nand beautiful visuals that grabs the viewer's attention and invokes emotion.There was one scene on episode 7 involving a telephone call that ended up being one of my favorite scenes in anime because of its invoking emotion.   \\n\r\nOverall-8\\n\r\n-If you want to cry this show is for you\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"ef: A Tale of Memories\" not an anime, but a visual essay. It is animated using sporadic drawings of various artistic methods to convey either emotion (e.g. faded watercolor, world of red) or a specific message (e.g. railroads, clocks). Bogged down in all of this visual imagery, ef struggles in the first 5-6 episodes to connect with the viewer - I kept asking myself, why keep watching this melodrama when I barely know anything about the characters? The answer lies in the second half, which is very rewarding and addresses all of the show's earlier issues.\r\nOverall, if drama/romance is your genre of choice, I wouldrecommend seeing ef to the end! Although the style comes off as pretentious and the story basically lacks a first act, it explores interesting themes and ties up everything into a proper ending.\\n\\n\r\nStory [6/10]: Unlike most anime, ef is thematically driven. It is centered around the idea of memory and definition of self, and the two major plot arcs reflect these. The result is a simple and focused, but fairly predictable story.\\n\\n\r\nPacing [6/10]: I don't think it would take a stretch of the imagination to picture this 13 episode series told in the span of one movie. Its length allows ef to effectively immerse the audience in the characters' dilemmas. We get scenes which explore a singular emotion such as loneliness. These keep the pace slow, but it still progresses steadily and wraps up well.\\n\\n\r\nArt [8/10]: As I mentioned earlier, the art is very experimental. The figures are still anime-esque, but each scene is punctuated with tasteful visual imagery.\\n\\n\r\nSound [4/10]: It felt like ef was one long monologue accompanied by slow, mournful music. Not that there aren't dialogues, but even these felt more like people talking at each other than actual conversation. The monotonous music and narration created a constant doleful mood. Everyone seems on the verge of tears, making the comedic lines seem out of place.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [5/10]: Along with the plot, the characters in ef act as storytelling devices used to explore the themes of the anime. Without a proper introduction to the cast, it isn't until the last few episodes that they seem to have actual personalities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [7/10]: ef takes risks to offer a theme-centered work with experimental art styles. It dares to be different, and sets itself apart from drama-romance peers. I'm glad to have seen it, though I don't plan on watching the sequel.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: [7/10]",

            "content": "\"There are no miracles in this world. There are only coincidences, inevitabilities, and our own actions.\"\r\nI feel that this show is the prototype for later productions. Directed in such a way as to make key animators run screaming in terror, and yet when it comes together it is a visual and dramatic tour de force.\r\nPersonally, the character designs felt like they were from an early 90s anime, somewhat distorted, but at least the animation QC kept them consistent from beginning to sequel's end. Additionally, there were a number of scenes in which the voices were directed to over-act, almost to the point of kabuki. Thecentral cast (Renji/Chihiro, Hiro/Miyako, and Kei) are otherwise well-directed. I liked the chemistry between Renji and Chihiro, despite the unique nature of their relationship. Hiro and Kyosuke, well, I wanted to punch, and Kyosuke even more so after he used Hiro as his personal punching bag, demonstrating what a hypocrite he is. Miyako... felt rather fake despite the good drama that developed around her story (I blame the fact that her backstory was almost entirely in dialogue), and Kei reminded me of every bad girl from middle school: manipulative, catty, and all too willing to cross the line. Similarly, Yu's repetitiveness made me wonder if he had a functioning brain.\\n\\n\r\nIt's the non-character set pieces that is the saving grace of the visuals. If it isn't obvious, \"memories\" is the theme of the production, and the way Shaft explored the way we treasure and keep memories (written words, photography, stories, spoken word...) should be treated as a master class in visual storytelling. Take the \"novel\" that is central to Renji and Chihiro's story. Shaft took a broken English \"translation\" of this and made it into a major visual element, especially in the opening animation (note how the letters start flying as the opening theme ramps up to the refrain) and commercial break eyecatches. The other written element, Chihiro's diary, is the perfect prop for the dramatic plot twist in episode 11 and the buildup to the climax.\\n\\n\r\nThis show was produced at a time when public telephones were almost phased out in the face of ubiquitous cell phones, and the now-extinct (in Japan, at least) reloadable telephone toll card plays an important role in the mini-climax of Hiro/Miyako's story, and additionally reiterates her greatest fear of silence. Showing the time left on the card counting down to zero in that scene is a powerful sequence.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was... forgettable. The piano riff played during the title card is all I can reliably remember, and I just rewatched this a week ago. The opening by Elisa is an example of something she likes to do for some reason: Attempt to write English lyrics, without much understanding of how English lyrics are written. There's probably a way to translate her lyrics into something that's a bit more respectable as a pop song, but then I'd need to know what she's trying to sing, which is tough with the audio alone. The ending songs are basically character songs, and each of the heroines have fully-animated endings except Miyako until episode 7 or 10. At this point Shaft isn't the powerhouse it is today, and the ending animation for Miyako's song is basically a slideshow until it's completed.\\n\\n\r\nSo in summary, good drama, so-so characters, brilliant non-character animation.",

            "content": "Criteria \r\nStory: 8\r\nA really interesting yet also simple story that shows the separate lives of two boys and the struggles they go through in finding their dreams and all the struggles and difficulties they encounter on the way. Asou Renji finds his love in a girl whose time stopped at the age of 12, whilst Hirono Hiro finds himself in the middle of a love triangle between his child hood friend and a girl who finds her-self acknowledged for the very first time in years. The love between Asou Renji and his maiden (he believes himself to be a prince ) makes for quite anice romance and good drama, whilst the love triangle between Hirono Hiro and his \u2018admirers\u2019 make for a nice combination of romance, comedy and drama. \\n\r\nEnding: 7.5\\n\r\nI rather liked the ending as it didn\u2019t feel as if it just ended; it felt as if a whole episode was dedicated towards the ending, which allowed for a lot of buildup. We finally see the results of Asou and his love and also the conclusion of Asou and Hirono\u2019s dreams. All up a rather good ending.\\n\\n\r\nSolid Plot: 8.5\\n\r\nPlot was good, as every episode related somewhat to the main story. None of those episodes where it\u2019s like \u201cwhat the hell has this got to do with anything\u201d. And if it does seem that way its relevance will be shown later on. Plot was good and consistent. \\n\\n\r\nMoral: 9\\n\r\nOf the many morals that this anime portrays by far the best your have to be that miracles sometimes do happen, we just have to believe in them, and that sometimes a miracle is the byproduct of one\u2019s own actions. This anime is also a harsh smack in the face to what reality really is, with that said the character Kuza-san is like the wise hermit with all the advice and proverbs that no one understands but it makes sense.\\n\r\nAsou: \u201cMiracles don\u2019t exist\u201d\\n\r\nKuza: \u201cThere are only inevitabilities and accidents, and what you\u2019re going to do\u201d \\n\r\n           \u201cBut sometimes the outcomes of you actions which become inevitable, will overlap with accidents and fulfil your dream unexpectedly\u201d                                                                                                                                \\n\\n\r\nSense: 9\\n\r\nEverything in EF \u2013 A Tale of Memories was thoroughly explained so when you finish the anime you don\u2019t leave thinking \u2018what the hell did I just watch\u2019\u2026..except for asking yourself who the hell is that girl?\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9\\n\r\nMusic of EF was also very nice and relative to the mood. During romantic scenes romantic music would be played to enhance the mood and during sad scenes sad music would be played to make you feel even sadder.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe art for EF was ABSOLUTEY AMAZING. I loved the art from the get go. Mixing in real life pictures with anime, just one of the techniques used to illustrate the seriousness of some scenes. Episode 7 was pretty scary though. However everything from the colors to the drawings where just done amazingly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nBoth character creation and character development was very impressive. From a girl stuck in time to one who is able to face her fears and accomplish her dreams and from a boy who has no idea what to do to one facing reality and choosing abandonment over complete loss. The characters in this story where truly great.\\n\\n\r\nBoredom/Captivation Scale: 7\\n\r\nI do admit however that the first 3-4 episodes of this anime had me on the side of my bed waiting for the \u2018real thing\u2019 to hurry up and start, but once the real thing did start it was a roller coaster of emotions. The funny parts I found extremely funny, the sad arts relatively sad (not as sad as Angel Beats or Ano Hana) and the romantic parts really romantic.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Score: 8\\n\r\nOverall an 8. In short if you haven\u2019t watched this anime yet get on it like\u2026.NOW!\\n\\n\r\nGenres\\n\r\nComedy: 7\\n\\n\r\nRomance: 7.5\\n\\n\r\nDrama: 7.5\\n\\n\\n",

I had just finished \"Zero no Tsukaima\"'s 3 seasons, so i was really looking forward to a good anime. I was surprised.\r\nStory-\r\nIt is a love story, romance and whatnot. It is told quite well, letting us see perspective on almost all of the characters. It tells the story of 3 or 4 couples, with the other 2 in the second season (tale of melodies). Each couple has problems and difficulties to overcome, and a good bit of the characters have an interesting, if notdownright pitiable, past. The story moves at a decent pace, not shoving stuff down your throat, but not dragging either.\\n\\n\r\nArt-\\n\r\nThe art in this anime was very good. There weren't many special effects, and if you actually look at the art, it looks kind of plain. But the way its used and presented makes it shine. It's very well put together.\\n\\n\r\nSound- \\n\r\nMy favorite part of this anime is the sound. The story ties into the opening and ending credits very well, and you will understand better after you finish the series. I LOVED the ending credits of ep. 12 of season 2. It was awesome.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\r\nEach character has personality and is unique. Although a few characters did things that i didn't think they would, it was very well thought out. Although some of the characters were complete assholes, most of them were friendly and easy to like.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\r\nYes. very much so.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\r\nIt's great. Season 2 wasn't as good, but had better sound. There were a few times when i thought some charactr was gonna kill him/herself, but everything worked out how i wanted it. (Except one guy)",

I wouldn't say it's the best, but it's just the kinda stuff a romance otaku would enjoy. \r\nEf is split into three stories, running simultaneous to each other. Two of them pretty much completely overlap each other (Hiro and Kyosuke) while the other is kinda in it's own little world (Renji). \r\nThis anime rly appealed because I seriously love watching romance anime where the heroine has some kinda 'flaw'. Chihiro's memory defect was original and Miyako's 'no one cares about me' was pretty good too. My only critisim is Chihiro'sseiyu, which was kinda a turn-off. Overall, it's one of the best roamnce i've seen for a while.",

The story telling method, the sceneries, diaolagues they just all perfectly fit; every moment you are shown the story it just takes you into theworld of theirs and their world is just full feelings. I think the director and the artists real outdone themselves because this anime's a type is that grabs you and makes you feel them inside your heart. Well for example at the end of episode 7 if you can't get the soul, feelings and mind of miyako then you just don't have a heart!! and there are many moments and expressions like that in this anime\\n\\n\r\nA must see for everyone who loves romantic animes! \\n\\n",

The story revolves around three main relationships. Personally, my favorite relationship in the story was that of Chihiro and Renji. Theirs is very different from the others and just different in general. I'm not going to put any spoilers about it, but it's a love/forget/hate relationship between them. And it gets better because it's the normal guy falls for the shy girl kind, so it makes it even more difficult to go with. There are so many obstaclesin all relationships, and i believe that the show truely shows the difference in people's kind of affection and their ways of approching their feelings. All in all, this was an amazing anime that made me cry, bite my nails, and gasp.",

            "content": "Okay, as always I want to preface my review with the three things I\u2019m looking for in an anime: I want a really good story (+5), I want really good dialogue (characters/character development, etc.)(+3), and I want really good \u201ctechnicals\u201d (style, sound, etc.)(+2). For this anime, I\u2019ll be giving an independent review per season since, while they\u2019re meant to go together, they can be watched independent of each other (Like Clannad/Clannad: After Story). So let\u2019s get to it!\r\nef: A Tale of Memories\u2026 This anime boils down to describing and giving a voice to what I\u2019m going to call \u201clove on the margins\u201d. What do Imean by that? Well, \u201clove on the margins\u201d is an rare and generally tragic kind of love, but, to me, altogether beautiful. Love doesn\u2019t always equal happiness. Imagine falling in love with someone who dies every day, only to wake up reborn but with no memory of you. Could you love that person? A better question, could that person love you? This is the premise of what I considered the main love story arc, although there are three love stories at play over the course of the season, each with their own merit. \\n\\n\r\nEarning 4 points \\n\r\n----------------------------\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of important messages being conveyed throughout the season about what it means to love another. Honestly, the dialogue handled quite a philosophical load fairly well without seeming too forced or unnatural in my opinion. Also, the emotion was there, and when we\u2019re talking a love story(s), I want to see that emotion! It deserves to be said, it\u2019s hard to get all that perfectly right all the time, and there are some scenes that are a little off in that regards as well as the ending being a little too over the top for my tastes, but\u2026 A solid performance.  \\n\\n\r\nEarning 2 points\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\\n\r\nRANT - \\n\r\nOkay, I\u2019m going to rant a bit here though. Frankly I was shocked to find this out in the second season, but, I had no idea these love stories were taking place in two totally separate locations. If it was ever mentioned in the anime, it needed to be mentioned again, because I didn\u2019t catch it. That\u2019s no bueno. If you want to hear my honest opinion, I don\u2019t think the first season thought much about the whole two towns idea going on. I mean, the towns look EXACTLY the same. The schools look EXACTLY the same. The beach, yep, same there too. Church? Why not? Long story short, if you\u2019re going to make it where the two towns are IDENTICAL, you better make it incredibly clear through dialogue that they\u2019re on opposite hemispheres of the world.\\n\\n\r\nDeduction of 1 point\\n\r\n------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is going to be one of those rare times that I\u2019m going to talk about technicals. This anime was a work of art. From the opening to the ending, I was blown away with the amount of nuance and artistic flair that went into it. This may very well be one of the most beautiful anime I\u2019ve seen to date. And, when I say beautiful, I don\u2019t mean just good animation, I mean moving animation, I mean scenes that speak to you on more levels than just plot and dialogue. Extra credit for this one.\\n\\n\r\nEarning 2 + 1 points\\n\r\n---------------------\\n\\n\\n\r\nBonus points goes to\u2026 well, I\u2019ve already given a bonus point for technicals, but, extra bonus for sex on the roof! Who saw that coming!? It was a quick scene though so\u2026\\n\\n\r\nEarning .5 points \\n\r\n--------------------\\n\\n\r\nAdd it all up and we have a score of 8.5! It\u2019s a beautiful anime with an interesting story. If you like love stories, this will be right up your alley. If you like art, you should check this out. If you like the philosophy of love, ask yourself this question: Are some people destined to be alone, incapable of loving and being loved truly because of who they are? You might find your answer watching this. \\n\\n\r\nAs always, since I\u2019m a critic, I\u2019ll round down my score to a 8 because that\u2019s just the way it goes. That way it\u2019ll be better than expected when you watch it! Till next time",

            "content": "*This is an archive from my Anime-Planet account*\r\nCritic's Log - Earthdate: July 16, 2012. Review #12: Ef: A Tale of Memories\r\nThe name's Giovanni, I am just an average citizen in the United States. I happen to be a bit different than some people. I happen to like anime because it is something I enjoy, but I don't remember quite clearly on how I was so fascinated from watching anime. One of my ambitions is to write a book, maybe because I like movies, shows, books and video games that have a great story. One of my hobbies includes critiquing anime. What I said is true,and yeah... this is part of the intro that would be most fitting for this review. Here is Ef - A Tale of Memories!\\n\\n\r\nOn Christmas Eve, a young male student named Hiro Hirono meets a girl named Miyako Miyamura as she chases a purse snatcher, Hiro later finds out that she attends the same school that he does and they start hanging out together. This makes Hiro's childhood friend Kei feel left out. She then tries to compete with Miyako for Hiro's affection, thus creating a love triangle. Meanwhile, another young man who is named Renji Aso meets a girl named Chihiro Shindo at an abandoned train station, He soon learns that Chihiro suffers from some sort of amnesia where her memory only lasts for 13 hours. Chihiro also dreams of writing a novel , but she has never fulfilled that dream due to her condition. Renji decides to help her fulfill that dream.\\n\\n\r\nTo be technical, this is an anime adaptation Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two which had a manga, some video games, and a couple of light novels. I haven't found any details about the manga and light novels but I have found out that the video games are classified as \"Eroge\", It is what Japan calls games that are erotic. *Insert Klaxon Horn sound effect* Yeah... The games possibly have sex scenes in them. It's pretty much anime video game porn, enough said...\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was made by Studio Shaft and I haven't really seen some of their animes but I will admit that they did pretty good on the visual department because the scenery is breathtaking in this anime. The style approach is a bit hit and miss and sometimes annoying. You'll see a short second of something a lot in this show. Here's an example below...\\n\\n\r\nI am a little puzzled as to why some scenes have this visual effect, but I guess the style is unique, I find it somewhat slightly overused, If you can get past these visual one second scenes of the show, you'll be fine. I still think the visuals are quite nice, even the opening looks fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately it seems the animation may be the biggest strength of all the elements of Ef: A Tale of Memories, This anime is definitely going to be a mixed bag for some otakus. There are some people that love this anime because of its beautiful imagery and visuals, some might not like it because of its slow pacing, there are some that have heard of it but never seen it, and there are some people that have not even seen it... AT ALL! I have seen the whole show and I sort of like it to some degree, this probably might not land in my favorites list but I will give Studio Shaft some credit, they did a wonderful effort making the visuals look like moving art. The animation is a bit limited in this show and it is a bit limited, that is the show's big flaw.\\n\\n\r\nThe story might be its biggest problem; it has nothing to do with the drama in this show... it's something to do with the romance that ensues in Ef: A Tale of Memories. I'll say this again... THIS ANIME IS KIND OF A MIXED BAG! When it comes to the romance moments, It is a bit boring for me. At least it picks up around the seventh episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe music by Eiichiro Yanagi and Tenmon really compliment the show pretty well, and it is really soothing and calming and it really fits the show. Yanagi-san has not composed any animes before or since Ef: A Tale of Melodies (which I'll review eventually), Tenmon on the other hand was the composer for the visually stunning 2007 anime film 5 Centimeters Per Second. (which had a beautiful musical score). The music in Ef is fitting and I guess there were a few songs worth listening to without the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe Voice acting is really good on both in Japanese and English but I might strongly recommend the Japanese version because it may make more sense watching this one subtitled, I listened to the dub for about 5 minutes and I thought it didn't sound bad at all. I stuck to the Japanese version because it felt appropriate to the character names, and the setting of the show. Christopher Ayres did great as an ADR director for making a dub that's really not that bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are sometimes a bit flat, except for maybe a few. These characters are not too interesting for me and this show uses little action and it is heavy with dialogue. I mean... NO ONE SHUTS THE FUCK UP IN THIS SHOW! That is not a big problem for me, I can handle animes like this, but if the characters are mostly boring and have little personality... it is going to be a big problem. The characters alongside the story arcs are not integrated really well.\\n\\n\r\nI will admit that Shin Oonuma directed this anime in a bit of a unique way, but I will say this one last time, this anime is a mixed bag. Some will like it, some won't...\\n\\n\r\nEf: A Tale of Memories is available from Sentai Filmworks, the manga called \"Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two\" which was written by Mikage and Yu Kagami and illustrated by Juri Miyabi has not been released in the US yet, the light novels also have not been released in the US either. The Ef video games also never got released in the US as well and considering what type of game it is, those kinds of games never get released in the US.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, Ef - A Tale of Memories is a unique art house anime with beautiful scenery, affective drama, and with some calming music. The story, characters and some animation quirks may have gave this anime some issues with viewers, it is not a terrible anime... it is just hard to get into...\\n\\n\r\nI give Ef - A Tale of Memories a 7 out of 10, It Is GOOD!\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to leave a comment, are there any memories you don't want to forget?",

            "content": "Ef ~ A Tale of Memories; it certainly remained in my memories better than most animes I\u2019ve seen. Although it\u2019s been awhile since I saw this, I\u2019ll try to give a review that does this show justice. \r\nStory [7/10] The story itself is relatively simple; it\u2019s not what makes this anime what it is. Basically there are two parallel romance stories. One is a love triangle of Hirano Hiro, the first male protagonist, his childhood friend Shindou Kei, and the clich\u00e9d \u201cnew girl who is there just to stir up drama between the two childhood friends\u201d Miyamura Miyako. The story proceeds just as any otheraverage love triangle anime, but once again, it\u2019s not the story that made me love this anime. The second plotline is that of a dramatic romance between Asou Renji and Shindou Chihiro (the sister of Kei). Although there is no \u201coutside interference\u201d between these two\u2019s relationship, it is the more dramatic story of the two. Chihiro had an accident when she was a child and because of this, she has a limited memory of thirteen hours (she remembers things before the accident). As such, she must always write down important events in her diary and read them every morning to retain, hopefully, a sense of herself. \\n\\n\r\nArtwork [10/10] One of the very first things that captured me was definitely the artwork. The first few episodes are somewhat slow moving and have a lack of the \u201cbang\u201d that most first episodes have (where the anime then proceeds to slow down and you regret ever watching it just because episode one was good). However, the artwork was so amazing that part of me was watching it just for the sheer beauty of it. The backgrounds are done fantastically, and the characters are drawn better than any other anime that was ongoing at the time. \\n\\n\r\nMusic [9/10] The music was quite beautiful in this anime, fitting the setting and themes, but I can't say there were many amazing songs. However, although any anime with decent music that can fit the scene correctly would earn a 7 in my rankings, what gave this such a high marking would have to be ELISA. As her debut into the musician world, her \u201cEuphoric Field\u201d was breathtakingly beautiful. Not only did I feel that every word in both English and Japanese (there are two different sets of lyrics) fit the feel and themes of the anime perfectly, but her singing ability really emphasized certain parts of the lyrics (and the OP scenes). She\u2019s not well known at the moment, but I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll become increasingly popular in years to come. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development [10/10] The way the characters are revealed is not only simply amazing, but there are things shown that requires the viewer to actually interpret things for his/herself as opposed to either the anime explicitly telling the story or having such a clich\u00e9d event that anyone who has seen more than a few romance animes could tell what is happening. The male leads are not as great as the females; nonetheless, there are things about them that are necessary to complement the female roles and fears as individuals. Hiro is an established mangaka who is attempting to balance work with school. This leads to a very stressful lifestyle as well as habitual pains in his precious drawing hand. Renji, on the other hand, is at a loss of what to do with his life. Although, as the story plays through, he finds what it is he wishes for. Neither male is all that interesting or dramatic, but there sure was an amazing job pairing their personalities with the females\u2019. \\n\\n\r\nMiyako is what appears to be a cheerful, careless young girl who habitually cuts class. She is viewed by Kei as someone who is an unnecessary temptation as he is already on the verge of failing to graduate. However, beneath the happy smiles and carefree expressions lies a dark secret of pain and suffering. While I will attempt to refrain from spoiling just what it is, it is shown that Hiro is the only person she has to rely on. Her love for him is not only that of lovers but also that of need, a requirement to maintain her own existence and what little happiness she has left, if any at all. It is because of this that she tries so hard to keep Kei away from him. She understands her own predicament and is willing to do whatever it takes to get what she wants (Hiro). \\n\\n\r\nKei is not such an interesting character as Miyako or Chihiro. She is, as stated above, Hiro\u2019s childhood friend who wants him all to herself and tries to keep Miyako away from him. In a sentence, she is as predictable as any other female childhood friends in any other romance anime (Da Capo comes to mind). However, her character development is actually far better done than those. While she starts as the selfish \u201coniichan\u201d crying girl, she makes her feelings clear to Hiro, and in the end, I found her much more likeable than any of the other girls that somehow end up with the guy she wants just because she cried 14/13 of the episodes. \\n\\n\r\nChihiro, as stated before, also has a traumatic present in which she is unable to maintain a sense of herself. Every day, she is \u201canother\u201d Chihiro who must read all of the events and react to it in what is hopefully the same way as \u201cyesterday\u2019s\u201d Chihiro would. Every day she meets Renji at an abandoned train station, but each time, she is meeting a new Renji, one she has never met before. Only \u201cyesterday\u2019s\u201d Chihiro had met him, and this is the start of the burden she must carry throughout their relationship. Furthermore, it is revealed that Chihiro had always wanted to write a novel, but she is unable to finish due to her condition. Renji offers to help her complete it, but what starts out as an innocent act of care spirals into a complex vortex of emotions, fears, and desires that is hidden beneath the story and world that Chihiro will create, or rather, what she is only re-creating from how she sees the world. For this plot development, it is truly boring, uninteresting, and most of all, seemingly completely random if the viewer is unable to interpret the story and images that Chihiro creates. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [10/10] Although I found nearly every moment of this anime enjoyable and entertaining, I also realize the complexity of said enjoyment. This is an anime that requires a lot of interpretation on the viewer\u2019s part. It isn\u2019t something you can watch and be spoon-fed every concern, fear, and issue of the characters as well as every meaning, theme, and lesson of the story. Also, this anime has a habit of throwing in a lot of seemingly random, unnecessary and apparently useless stuff. These unique storytelling techniques include a frequent showing of a couple sentences of text shown in a black background and a very annoying but hardly forgettable countdown sequence of a full minute. In my opinion, these things add to greatness of the show, but I know for certain that others find them annoying, random, and above all, meaningless. If you don\u2019t think you can handle these things that require you actually do your own thinking, I suggest you look elsewhere for your romantic dramas. Otherwise, try the first episode to get a feel of what I am talking about and if, at the very least, you are not bothered by them, continue on, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll at least be able to enjoy the art, music, and drama of ef ~ A Tale of Memories. \\n\\n\r\nOverall [9/10] I rarely give out 9\u2019s or 10\u2019s, but this anime was fantastic. The best parts would have to be the careful telling of the somewhat hidden themes of the anime. It is truly an anime that teaches life lessons in a most amazing and thoughtful way. If there was one reason why it did not earn a 10 it would have to be because of the ridiculous amount of plot holes. Why do Chihiro and Kei never meet, despite being in the same city? Who is this Yuuko who appears to be some kind of angelic character who gives advice to nearly all the characters? What is the relationship between Himura and Yuuko? Luckily, all these questions and more are answered in the sequel, a tale of melodies.",

The music and plot is beautiful and sad at times. With a pinch of tragedy, a lick of \"love\", and a dollop of shock, this is definitely a great anime. However the most outstanding thing about this anime (imo) is the characters. All the characters are different and well explored personality wise and adequately explored past wise. Its a Beautiful anime that has actually pushed Clannad Afterstory a bit in my mind.It has a surreal feel to it thought it moves farther way from surrealism and more into the romance about episode 8. With all its beauty I ranked this a 9.9999999999999999 the only regret I feel off it is that it's only 12 episodes :(. \\n\r\nIf you like romance at all... WATCH THIS ANIME\\n\r\nIt includes all romance if only a hint. From Taboo motherly love, to subtle realization of love, all the way to the classic simple \"I love you\" romance. I won't say anymore cause it might ruin imo the deepest part of the story.\\n\r\n...WATCH IT",

This is a rare one which you don't come across everyday.\r\nI'm a sucker for good drama/romance shows and I can promise I don't usually cry for watching drama, romance animes/shows/movies with good/sad endings but this one almost made me do it.\r\nEf stands out as an anime for expertly depicting the relationships between characters following a strong story line, oddly mysterious yet intriguing. The characters are so well portrayed that you end up feeling what the character would feel in certain situations, either happy or sad. Maybe even cry when they actually do. The show makes you learn more about the characters episode afterepisode that you might end up predicting what might happen next or what he/she might do next but may fail. Maybe it's just a feeling of wanting something to happen or wanting him/her to do something. But I think that's what makes this anime stand out.\\n\\n\r\nI'd give art a 9. It's not too different or unique but it's consistent which is hard to find in animes. \\n\r\nMusic is outstanding. The goosebumps you get for situations would be mainly caused by the good music which would suit that situation.\\n\\n\r\nAll I can say is, if you're into this genre, this is something you can't miss out on.",

Half of the anime is UNEEDED per say.\r\nFirst episode, a little slow, second, you have something, and then little by little as it gets interesting a certain half of the story falls to sh*t.\r\nWell if you don't know already, Ef has two stories running by it side by side, the anime says they're \"linked\" but not really. The better half of the storygets really introduced at episode 2, and keeps our interests, but what this anime likes to do is switch off a lot. When one part of the story is interesting, then it switches to the next one, and vice versa. It....was really annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a lot of things I don't like about this anime, but my biggest problem is \\n\r\nCHARACTER INTERACTIONS\\n\\n\r\nAKA\\n\\n\r\nTHE SH*T SIDE OF EF\\n\\n\r\nThis part of the story doesn't start off badly, but then it slowly turns into a cliche, annoying, heart-breaking, dumb guy, frenzy, that I have seen far too many times.\\n\\n\r\nI mean, ok, this WAS based off a eroge game....but...\\n\r\nactually it probably should've just stayed that way.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, there is this fur-coated Akame that keeps appearing in front of the characters and when she disappears like a ghost the characters are like,\\n\\n\r\n\"O, well ok.\"\\n\\n\r\nAny who, enough ranting, now for some good parts of Ef.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the other half of the story, I would've like this much more if they had focused on it, actually no, just devoted the entire anime to it.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing, the animation is like its straight out of a visual novel. There are also many other visual effects that make this anime very appealing.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, it was good at some parts, but there really was no official OP or ED to the anime.\\n\r\n(Except for the last episode, last episode had an ED)\\n\\n\r\nBut overall, I try to keep my expectations neutral (not expecting too much, not expecting too less)\\n\r\nand I was a little excited seeing as this anime had an 8.10 rating and LOTS of 10 star reviews, I was MAJORLY disappointed, but many people like it, so maybe you might too.\\n\\n\r\nIt's just it has a lot of overly dramatic tropes i've seen before and that I don't like.\\n\\n\r\nBut I guess one more good thing I can say about this anime, is that both sides of the story end satisfyingly.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Alright, here goes- but before you sit at your computer (or phone, whatever) and angrily glare at this post, hear me out first; I'm not judging this anime from a professional's perspective, nor am I putting deep thought into this review. Rather, this is simply the initial impressions that I received from this anime; I completely understand that some people like it, but I however do not. \r\nStory- \r\nThe story of this... how to put it. It was... dreadful, absolutely horrific. Alright, although I may say that, and although you may be getting all aggravated just reading through this reply, allow me to justify. \r\n(tryingto give as minimal spoilers as possible, although will include some) \\n\r\nThe story opens with our 6 main characters, in which half of I forget the name of. Only one of them is really interesting, as they seem to be hiding somewhat of a darkness lurking underneath them. That's Chihiro I'm talking about, perhaps the only truly memorable character of this series; and barely even memorable at that (I'm sorry I didn't even realize). We get our two pairs of characters that are undeniably gonna end up lovers; but as we see the story follow them, it's just... ugh. Constantly flipping from one to the other in a predictable manner; I feel as if I'm just watching a documentary on different couples. \\n\\n\r\nBut that's not the truly bad part; this story, this \"work of art\" is so utterly plain. I just cannot stand how awfully, how tragically plain it is. Did you want a satisfying moment? Nope, you don't get any. Did you want something shocking to suddenly happen? Nope, you don't get any of those moments. I am nowhere near to being as close in talent as the creators of this series, but even I saw several moments where they could've made the viewer go \"wtf\" in a good way. Here are some examples of what I mean, and caution, there will be minor spoilers. \\n\\n\r\nFirst, remember that one episode where it showed Kei looking up at the sky, you know, looking all treacherous and utterly envious? It showed the train tracks, and then later we see a scene with here talking to Miyako rather confrontationally. Threatening her and all that jazz, so I thought \"holy fuck she's gonna push her on the railroad.\" Did she? No. No, she merely stalked away like a little bitch. So, in counter you may say, \"but that would be too predictable.\" But in that, you're wrong, for I only made that assumption a couple moments prior to the actual event. If it had happened, perhaps my opinion would be changed a fair bit on the series. But alas, it didn't, and this utterly plain vibe continued throughout 10 (not even 12) episodes of mere suffering. \\n\\n\r\nSecond, how about when Chihiro kinda got all glitchy when she was asking Shinji (or whatever his name is) to kiss her? Did we ever see anything else regarding that later? No, and that was arguably the only cool and actually interesting scene in this anime. Not to mention, I'd automatically assume \"hey, she's some sort of demon or something, she's not as innocent as she seems.\" Is she? Nope. Which is actually fine, but it angers me how many places they could've gone with that; they could've completely twisted her character into a very unique and intricate one that could be described as an antagonistic protagonist. But they didn't. She just remained Chihiro, and that was it. \\n\\n\r\nThird, lets take a look at the scene where Miyako was rapidly texting that manga guy (I forget his name) when he wouldn't meet at their spot. The pacing and visuals of this scene are done well, although the rest is absolute garbage. I expected that he was gonna be dead, and perhaps Kei (whatever her name is) would appear and threaten her. Did that happen? No, turns out that manga guy is perfectly fine, and Kei doesn't do anything except bitch about it. Again, they could've gone tons of places with this scene, but instead they stick to the very basics. Garbage. \\n\\n\r\nI could go on about this, but I don't got all day to write about such a shitty anime. The one last topic I will mention however is episode 10. Episode 10, the horrendous episode 10. It made me go \"wtf\" in a really bad way. I mean, the manga guy's best friend or whatever just tells him how he's indecisive and can't make up his mind about anything leading others to get hurt. So you know, he's gotta do something honourable about it, right? Thus he goes up to Kei, and after she confesses her love for him, he practically does the same for her. You'd think they're good with each other now and that she's the one for him, right? No, then he goes up to Miyako and professes his love for her. I mean, which way do you swing? Pick one or the other, because unfortunately due to the plain nature of this anime I can assume he's not just polyamorous. \\n\\n\r\nStory Rating: Absolute shit, a 2\\n\\n\r\nArt- \\n\r\nNow the art was pretty good, I do say; of course, it isn't entirely my style (Danganronpa is an example of said style) but it's good. The anime features many unique scenes and often pretty visuals that could perhaps spark some emotion; if everything else wasn't such shit. The art in the opening is also quite fantastic; but my score does not go above 6 as I just simply cannot single out this quality from the horrible rest. \\n\\n\r\nArt Rating: Pretty damn good, but since the other, dreadful aspects far overshadow it, a 6 \\n\\n\r\nSound- \\n\r\nThe sound is nothing special; the only thing I like is the opening, really. The opening is quite good and does quite a good job at attempted portrayal of the story; in fact, it actually tells the story better than the actual anime does itself. And while it actually does a good job in representing it, this is only because the anime fails to represent it at all. It truly seems to have wasted potential. \\n\\n\r\nSound Rating: Good, but only the opening \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- \\n\r\n...\\n\r\nI won't even talk too much about how utterly horrendous, how utterly plain the characters were. Name me one defining trait of that manga guy, other than the fact he writes manga; how about one defining trait of bigger characters like Miyako. The only character that can be defined is Chihiro; and the only words I can think of is \"timid, cowardly\". All of the characters are horribly predictable in what they do, and all tend to fall in sappy, cliche love drama. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- \\n\r\nI found myself struggling to get through this anime. You know that anime that you just want to finish so that you can see the ending and move on to another one? You know the anime that you think has some potential to finally tell a good story, but fails to do so? Yeah, that's this anime for me; eventually I just got tired of it and dropped it, even though I was only two episodes away from finishing. The whole anime is filled with sappy, cliche romance (as mentioned above) that is too utterly plain and predictable; wow, they have secrets? Dark pasts that trouble their relationships? Wow, what a shocker. While I am not a big fan of the romance genre, it can be executed in an absolutely fantastic way; this typically involves chemistry between the two but not entirely blatant chemistry, that slowly builds up rather than \"love at first sight\" or whatever. It also may involve surprising twists and turns that change the story and effect the characters. Not to mention the characters are good and definable, not entirely revolving around one another; examples of this include Spice and Wolf, Akatsuki no Yona, any ship in Danganronpa, Fullmetal Alchemist, Naruto (although it does not focus too much on the couples), and even Tokyo Ghoul being the shit anime that it is. But this is just... ugh. It's bad. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- \\n\r\nHorrible, would not recommend. Again, this is my personal opinion, so I would kindly ask you don't get all fired up if you are in favour of this anime. The only good thing in it is the art, and otherwise it's utterly painful and cliche. Do yourself a favour if you're not a fan of cliche romance dramas and stay far, far away from this anime.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I got this recommended to me as I had enjoyed other Works from shaft. And desided to watch it some time ago. \r\nStory \r\nThe best thing about this anime was the story. It was a heartwarming and heartbreaking story with a lot of great points. The story isn\u2019t really that original when you think about it, but it did the job with pulling me in. It gave us two different stories, that didn\u2019t resemble each other as much as I thought it would. This is where the story slightly failed me. Even though it did great with both stories, one of them struck me asslightly over dramatic. Both stories had their over dramatic points, but one of the stories especially annoyed me, as things could get a little over the top. As much as the story annoyed me at times, it was still worth everything. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nThis was, in my opinion, the worst thing about it all. We get five MC\u2019s, but out of these I only grew to like two of them. Both from the same story. The three characters from the other story just annoyed me up until the very last episodes. I ended up getting what I wanted from both stories in the very end, but those three characters just annoyed me to no end during it all. With that said, it wasn\u2019t all bad. Even with the slightly over dramatic scenes and events, all characters had at least one thing to them that I could relate to. \\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation \\n\r\nI can\u2019t complain about the art. It\u2019s bright and very detailed. Even if the art style didn\u2019t appeal to me all that much, it is still good and quite unique. With colors that follows the characters moods and art that was able to capture the characters emotions. \\n\\n\r\nMusic/sound \\n\r\nThe sound for this anime was good. With good background music, befitting the mood of the anime, and the overall happenings. The background music is touching and brings a lift to every scene. I will recognize that the theme, Euphoric Field, is good in it\u2019s own way, and very befitting the anime, even if it didn\u2019t appeal to me as much as many other songs. \\n",

I'm not really a fan of mystery, but since a lot has said in Youtube that this anime was good so I still give it a try.\r\nStory :\r\nThe story is good, although I already feel bored in the first few episodes there has. But still, I still get up and watching this. Turns out, the story was way better than I thought it would be. Just if this anime wasn't a mystery anime, I might have give 8 or 10 for the story. To thinkthat I have to understand two different stories in two different times. If I didn't focused watching this, I might be ending up didn't understand the whole stories. It's funny if you should asked, anime is actually for an entertainment not for stressing me out but this anime right here, it managed to stressed me out but I won't say this anime is bad though.\\n\\n\r\nArt :\\n\r\nThe art is pretty much like any other anime that I've watched. But this one was quite spectacular. I mean some art are just blatantly there like a background. But this one, they create a little bit different way.\\n\\n\r\nSound :\\n\r\nI'd say it's fair, I mean it's just fair for the anime only but not for individual listening to.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter :\\n\r\nIt's good, although there are some funny scenes in the middle of stressful drama like how Chihiro falls and said help me. I mean, that scene supposed to be like (gasp) but I laughed at that scene. Not because I found it funny but I found Chihiro falls in a funny way. She should've fall gracefully than fall in a dance way. But still it's still good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment :\\n\r\nI want to give a 5 but still I want others to give this a shot too. I admit personally I don't really enjoy this anime but since it has romance in it, I still love the romance in this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall :\\n\r\nI give 7 since it's still good somehow. Just when it comes to mystery, I think this anime was quite a bad spinoff. Maybe if this anime didn't have mystery, this anime will be a good anime for sure",

            "content": "While browsing VA's I came across this anime, and after reading the summary I thought this would be just a generic romance/drama story. I retracted this statement promptly after the first episode sucked me into this gorgeous fairy tale.\r\nstory 9/10\r\nEf consists of two tales brimming with suspense and drama. Every episode shows us more dilemmas, partial answers and makes you hungry for more. The only minor downside is that at the beginning and the end of the anime, one of the tales is put on hold for a bit in favour of the other tale, this however adds to the suspense and in the endboth of the tales get adequate screentime and is in no way confusing when they pick up the pace later.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEf is a masterpiece, no doubt about it. SHAFT and Rondo Robe really pulled out everything they got, especially the parts that look hand drawn are absolutely stunning. The art styles do not only look beautiful, but they also enhance the power of the story by complementing the part of the story they are used in, and even though this anime is three years old, it doesn't show at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very well made and they immerse you even more into the story. There are times that you feel for the characters and the problems they come across. The VA's did an excellent job and fit the characters perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEf-A tale of Memories is one of those animes you should watch or at least try. This is truly one of those animes that make you cry and give you that warm fuzzy feeling in the end.",

            "content": "The Ef franchise stands as a memorable, nostalgic piece in my past. It was one of the earliest works that I picked up and hopefully that didn't inflate my opinion of it too much.\r\nThis romantic drama introduces quite a few interesting features that I hadn't seen before to that point, including telling the stories of three couples at the same time. Though the story is a bit difficult to pick up at first, it all becomes evidently clear later on. The one thing that really stands out in this series is the studio's unique use of visuals that make the experience literally something worth remembering.\r\nAnimation:\r\nIngeneral, the scenery is vivid and almost Air TV -like in quality. The director seemed to be experimenting with artistic touches, such as showing two screens at once and such. Though some of the effects make this seem almost more of an art than an anime, at certain moments it truly works to the anime's advantage and heightens the tension. The characters are all well drawn (though I seriously think one of the main protagonist's hair makes him look too feminine). At the time, I thought there was \"suggestive\" adult material- but in the context of works today this is pretty benign.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound was well above average, and is used in combination with the unique animation style to create a powerful atmosphere that will be felt by the watcher. Elisa's OP is a high pitched, melodic piece that I dare you to try at Karaoke and still maintain your voice. Each of the heroines have their own OP, many of which are also very good. The BGM is, for once, a pivotal reason why the sound here is so good. The OST is definitely worth collecting and is full of strong emotions and (wait for it...) memories.\\n\\n\r\nThough the VA cast wasn't particularly that famous, the performance was still great nonetheless. All the characters had a great deal of passion. I personally felt that Hiroko Taguchi did a great job for Miyako.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nAs mentioned above, there are really three stories here. One about a boy who meets a girl whose memory lasts only thirteen hours, one about a high school manga artist who meets a mysterious and carefree girl, and one about a third boy searching to catch a \"sparkle\" in his films. Strangely enough, all three stories are loosely connected as one will find out. All the three stories have to deal with the theme of memories and not wanting to be forgotten. The actual anime focuses on the first two relationships with the third being a related side relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot sequence is slightly predictable though there are moments of intense drama coupled with an amazing animation scheme. All I'll say about the ending is not to expect \"nice boats\". It is a very satisfying conclusion and ends the story very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nCertain characters are given a lot more emphasis than others. Only the three girls' pasts are completely explained and one of the boy's past (since his past is directly related with one of the girls). Side characters are introduced but contribute minimally to the story (perhaps to be explicated more in a sequel). The developments between the characters are well done and I didn't end up disliking any of them.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThis has great re-watch value as knowing the ending gives a different perspective on how the characters behaved earlier. This value increases further once you get the meta-level understanding that the sequel adds on top. This is a classic that I highly recommend checking out.",
