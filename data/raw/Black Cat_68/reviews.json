            "content": "Gah~ Ceray's Review Time (procrastination in disguise)! Anyway, this is the review for the anime Black Cat. The anime is about Black Cat, also known as Train Heartnet, who once was an assassin for the organization Chronos. Due to events that happen in the story, Train quits being an assassin to becoming a sweeper/bounty hunter.\rPlot: Since I haven't read the manga (yet) I can't compare the plots, I do know, however, that the storyline has changed a bit, however that doesn't really affect the story. The main part of the story consists of Train more or less wanting to confront a ghost from his pastand this takes up roughly a little less than half the series. Though it's good that Black Cat had other small subplots, it felt rushed at times, as if they wanted to get straight to the action, which took away from the enjoyment. That aside, the story was wonderful, and kept me anxious for the next episode (which is why I finished so quickly), wanting to know what would happen to Train and company next.\\n\rScore: 7/10\\n\\n\rAnimation: If you want me to express what I though about the animation for Black Cat in one word that word would be \"PWETTY.\" Not pretty, but pwetty. The animation is smooth and does look all.... icky. Yeah. If there's one thing about the animation that I have to point out is that Train looks younger, a few years younger. I mean, he's twenty three in the manga, but in the anime he looks nineteen (age change could be because of the changed time line...). What else should I say? The ending animation for the first twelve episodes is amusing, but only until... episode eight, but honestly I was missing it after a while. But, that's not the point, and the point is that Black Cat's animation nice... No reused animation, as far as I saw. \\n\rScore:10/10\\n\\n\rSound: Ah~ The background music, it's music to my ears. The music pretty much matches the mood of the current scene, for example during the dramatic scenes some sort of opera sounding music plays giving you that... ominous (?) feeling. I absolutely adored the piano version of the song Konoyo no Uta, which plays at certain points in the series. The opening theme, Daia no Hana, is amazing as well... However, the first ending theme Namidaboshi sometimes doesn't match the mood of the episode that it's ending... \\n\\n\rNow usually, I don't watch subs, this is because I'd rather hear it in English, with Black Cat, I had no choice but to watch it subbed... And how wonderful it was. Takashi Kondo pulls Train off extremely well, sounding one way when serious and totally lighthearted another way. Also Shin'ichiro Miki makes Creed sound absolutely obsessed, which is good... I guess...Cept, I dun like Creed...\\n\rScore:9/10\\n\\n\rCharacter: Ah. Do I have to put this? I totally love the characters of Black Cat... Even Creed, who scares me a lot. They aren't all that different than their manga counterparts, which is... good, and you can really tell the difference between then, Train is Train, Tanya is Tanya and Creed.... is obsessed.\\n\rScore: 9/10\\n\\n\rEnjoyment: ... Must I explain?... Well... I sorta watched the whole series for Train... So... yeah...\\n\rScore: 9/10\\n\\n\\n\rOverall:\\n\\n\rYay!: Animation is smooth and pwetty. Smooth animation is good on Ceray's glasses ridden eyes.\\n\rNay!: Plot was way too rushed. Pull it out at least ten or so more episoes.\\n\rScore: 9/10\\n",

            "content": "First of all, to be honest with you all. I did not enjoy this series as much as i thought i would like it mainly because of the plot and how it got fairly rushed in the end.\r\nStory - The beginning part of the story i thought was very well made, it was very dark, mysterious but not scary at all for those who dislike scary storylines. But after a while the plot just seem dull and unoriginal. Typical protagonist trying to save the world, trying to protect his friends and trying to get revenge, all these types of storylines has been overused, if BlackCat had a better storyline, i believe it would have been better.\\n\\n\r\nArt - I liked the design of the characters, especially Train during the beginning of the series. So i have nothing to complain about the art category.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Not much to review about sound, but i have to admit the gunshots were pretty real. Also, the voice actors fitted the role very well, especially Eve and Sven. The OP was quite nice, fitted into the anime quite nice.. Forgot how the ED goes so i can't review that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- One of the things that makes Black Cat enjoyable are the wide variety of characters. It is quite amusing watching Jenos and Rins yell at each other. So if your looking for some humorous characters, Black Cat has that for you. The one thing that i thought lacked in the character section was the sudden change of Train Heartnet. Although it says half a year has passed, I'm pretty sure people other then me wants to watch the process of him from a deadly assassin to a overly energetic young man. Another reason i suggest Black Cat was rushed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Black Cat is actually quite enjoyable if you do not care about the unoriginal storyline seeing that the characters are greatly designed and there are many great fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Overall i would say Black Cat is a fair made anime that fails to achieve better due to the lack of storyline and how it is quite rushed. Although i say this, i still enjoyed Black Cat to it's full potential.",

            "content": "I\u2019m gonna be straight here \u2013 Black Cat is one of the most disappointing anime I\u2019ve ever watched. It\u2019s been two years since I watched this anime and I\u2019m still a little bitter at how much potential remained unrealized at its end.\r\nBlack Cat is about this assassin named Train Heartnet (hey, at least he escaped whoever named all the characters in Geass). Or wait, it\u2019s about this secret bio-weapon disguised as a loli named Eve. Actually no, it\u2019s about this bounty hunter dude named Sven. Oh, wait, never mind, I remember, it\u2019s actually about the villain, Creed, who has a hard-on for Train. No hangon, it might\u2019ve been about the organization that Train worked for, Chronos\u2026\\n\\n\r\nSee, I\u2019m writing all of this as if the abundance of disparate elements in the plot is a bad thing, but the thing is, the story started out with a ton of potential. The first four or five episodes do a great job of tying all these characters together in a sensible and, dare I say, a captivating manner. Seriously, the beginning of this show is excellent. It\u2019s exciting and a bit dark without getting too edgy or angsty, the characters all have good synergy and play off of each other very well, and the pacing is near-perfect.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then the timeskip happens.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll try to be brief and not spoil anything here, but suffice it to say that a certain main character\u2019s personality does a complete 180 after the timeskip, and virtually zero explanation for the change is given to the viewer, outside of occasional scattered hints that refer to certain events that happened pre-timeskip. This is unfortunately only the beginning, as the rest of the anime devolves into a giant mess of hastily-introduced and poorly-fleshed-out characters, a distinct lack of focus on core plot points that the initial episodes tried to establish, and a ridiculous number of plot contrivances that attempt to reconcile this lack of focus, to no avail. The pacing is haphazard at best and has all the grace of a one-legged donkey at worst. The only relatively consistent character throughout the show is Sven; everyone else undergoes obscenely rushed character \u201cdevelopment\u201d, which is really just most of the characters overreacting to major events and, much like aforementioned main character, completely flipping the script on their personalities and becoming the exact opposite of who they originally were. This isn\u2019t even mentioning the staggering number of characters this show introduces. There are like 10 new villains that arrived on the scene halfway through the show, plus all the Chronos assassins and executives, plus the guys who were in charge of those 10 or so new villains I just mentioned\u2026the list just keeps growing and growing, and almost none of them get any kind of proper characterization, let alone development. It\u2019s as if Naruto or One Piece were to condense themselves into 25 or so episodes, and cram their entire casts and plot into that timeframe. It\u2019s insane.\\n\\n\r\nAll that being said, the anime does have its good qualities. As I said before, the first part of the anime is very well done, and it constructs a reasonably compelling narrative while introducing a pretty solid cast of characters to drive it forward. The art and animation are also good, although the color palette was a little weird and off-putting at times. The soundtrack is fairly strong as well, and I am particularly fond of the opening theme.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the overwhelming number of flaws prevent this anime from being anything more than way below-average at best. In truth, the last three-quarters or so of this anime are straight up terrible in terms of execution. Still, though\u2026I can only imagine how much more enjoyable this anime could\u2019ve been if they had just stuck to the format the first few episodes had established. It\u2019s a damn shame. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "At first I didn&rsquo;t like it, but it grew on me after a while. I didn&rsquo;t like it at first probably because it was a bit serious, and its first impression on me wasn&rsquo;t that good. The storyline for the first few episodes didn&rsquo;t grab me, and I found myself always distracted by something else. \r\nThe storyline was promising, but I felt like the creators tried to fit as much as they can in only 26 episodes. Only the last three episodes were dedicated to Eve&rsquo;s true nature, which was almost forgotten.\r\nCharacter design was average. The Numbers and the other villains who had the powerof the Tao looked impressive (Specially Leon), but Sven was just weird, Eve had a big head (although she was adorable when she became a bit human) and Rins tried to pull of some fan service but it didn&rsquo;t work too well for her. I have to say the characters were poorly managed &ndash; there were just too many of them and in the end, not everyone was able to get a good amount of screen time. I don&rsquo;t even know the names of most of the sweepers from the sweeper alliance. A lot of them were unnecessary too. Although I still find myself liking Train. He was so cool and mysterious at first but in the end he became so wacky and funny and just adorable. \\n\\n\r\nDrawing style was so &ndash; so. I felt like it was almost there, but still quite lacking. Train was well drawn, but there were times when the drawing style would change and his face would morph. Speaking of morph, I noticed that the colors were inconsistent, specially when it came to hair colors. Towards the end I noticed that Sven&rsquo;s hair was a darker green, and Eve&rsquo;s hair was a paler yellow, and Rins&rsquo; hair was also a lighter purple. The colors were just sub par. I would also like to note the use of CG, which complimented the animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was okay. At first I thought Train&rsquo;s voice didn&rsquo;t match him, because he looked too young and his voice was too low. When he became more cheerful and friendly, his voice changed and became more suited to his personality. I was also happy to find out that Number X&rsquo;s (Shaolee?) seiyu was the same seiyu for Kohsaka from Genshiken, Wolfram from Kyo Kara Maoh!, Junior from R.O.D the TV and Robert Haydn from Law of Ueki. I love all of those series and I thought the seiyu for all those characters did well too, so it was definitely a plus to have her be a seiyu for Black Cat as well, even if it&rsquo;s just a supporting role. \\n\\n\r\nI&rsquo;m a big fan of the BGM for this series. I thought the BMG complimented the scenes well, and if not, improved the feel of the scenes. I was a bit indifferent towards the opening and ending themes, specially the first ending theme &ndash; I just thought it didn&rsquo;t match the anime at all, but it grew on me. Same for the second ending theme which was a bit dull and boring, but in the end I got to appreciate its beauty. \\n\\n\r\nIt did reach my expectations &ndash; it lived up to the name of Gonzo after all. It was a good decision to watch it and I understand why it&rsquo;s so popular in the Philippines. I can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s great, specially since the ending under whelmed me (yet again), but it was a good watch for most of the time.",

            "content": "The purpose of this review is to express my disappointment as someone who read the manga first and enjoyed it a lot, and I will actually put my conclusion as an introduction so that at least some people will not summarily dismiss this (although I do not know how effective that will be; people tend to rate based on if the scores agree with them).\r\nNone of this is to say that the anime is not worth watching if you have not read the manga, or even if you have, everyone is different and you might wildly enjoy it. It has a genuine plot that hasa clear goal and approaches it with a fairly consistent pace; it is rather all the little details which detract from this anime for me. The manga's art is more enjoyable since it is not poorly animated, its plot is executed more grandiosely, which is the main difference besides art that bothers me, and the manga allows you to imagine how the characters act a little more, and while sometimes an anime exceeds my imagination, as I am not very creative, it did not in this instance.\\n\\n\r\nI think the easiest place to start is the art. If you have watched a lot of Gonzo, then you probably have found that although maybe not always superb, they have had a hand in such creations as Gankutsuou or Last Exile with superb animation that moves very naturally (except in the terrible mech scene), and even in less refined instances like Full Metal Panic! or Gantz is still quite acceptable typically. In this anime it moves very awkwardly and left me rendered uncomfortable the entire anime. It is not the worst art ever, and I am giving it a three not so much for the actual drawing style, which is probably around fairly typical, but for the emphatically terrible way in which movement occurs.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is stellar. In regard to music, I usually try to rate it this way: if it does not detract from the anime, then I am not upset (if it detracts I will rate it a 1 or 2 by default). In this case, it is certainly no Cowboy Bebop or anything, but it never terribly detracts, distracts, or annoys.\\n\\n\r\nI want to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that the plot changes they made were for the amount of time they had allotted to do with the amount of episodes, but I found almost every plot change to be for the worse, which is why I penalized the story so highly. It is much more exciting and constantly 'epic' in the manga. I will not spoil them here, but if you have read and not watched or vice versa, then you will easily notice them.",

            "content": "Main\r\nI almost never watched this show because I was told the show sucked....which I guess only goes to show that not matter what people say or how many people say it, it's really up to the individual and that person's preferences. Needless to say my review will probably be taken as a dissenting opinion from the majority who have given this show a medium to low score. Black Cat is not a bad show and it's not really a disappointing show either....only to those who selected this series with the expectation of finding the next Holy Grail of an anime, i.e., Cowboy Bebop or Trigun.\r\nIfyou decide to pick this series to watch, then judge it on it's own merit and you will enjoy it a lot better. There's a nice mixture of funny and sad moments [expect some characters being killed off], there is some dramatic tension and a decent climax. Again, to me this was not such a horrendous story and I don't see where the big disappointment is. So I guess it would be best to say that this is the type of show you are going to have to watch and then formulate your own opinions about it. \\n\\n\r\nArt Style\\n\r\nAt first I thought &ldquo;Gee, what sucky animation! ....Especially for something that came from Gonzo!!!!&rdquo; But then I thought it was unfair to &ldquo;expect things&rdquo; and not allow room for change or a different form of expression. So I guess I could say that the animation for this show was pretty standard during the non-combat scenes......and &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; during the battle scenes. By experimental I mean, that the movements aren't very stylish, fancy, fluid or even detailed for that matter, objects tend to move at a super fast rate and there's a lot of [over] usage of different blurring effects and overlays. Also during these battle scenes a lot of times you won't have any backgrounds just the characters duking it out with their own brand of super powers thru numerous repeated [non-looped] scenes and multi-angled shots. Nothing else really stands out animation-wise, there aren't any beautiful scenery or exotic locales, this show is pretty much character driven so expect most [if not all] scenes to involve these people with powers in various situations. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI can't remember there being much music in this show. My favourite song has to be the OP, not for any particular reason except for that I like the part where Saya spins at &frac12; speed in her star-printed yukata, and the sound of the singers voice at that part. The first ED song I don't remember....I just like all the cat-faced people running and jumping around, the second ED song was also very nice, but I didn't think it should have been part of this anime's soundtrack.....also again I did like the little filmstrip flashback with Saya at the very end. \\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nEventho I read some reviews on a couple of sites, I don't think the story was such a total mess. Yes! I DO think the ending was a little abrupt, it could have used a little cleaning up and with the series overall, a little tightening up here and there could have been done.....but it was still a fairly decent and entertaining story! But really I think just because this series started with that type of dramatic opening scenes with the shady characters jumping around on rooftops and a couple assassinations, people thought &ldquo;YES! Guns, assassins, gangsters...Gungrave, Bebop, Trigun!!!&rdquo; and then was put off by the shows apparent goofiness. The thing is the show was always goofy and was intended to be that way from the get-go. Now whether or not the manga was originally as goofy I don't know and honestly part of the reasons I used to not read mangas much was because I knew I would have issues with animes that didn't do a good job with the adaptation and I wouldn't be able to wholly enjoy the show. Black Cat I did enjoy because I watched it without trying to attach it to something else or try to compare it to anything else whether it be the original manga or other anime shows and it was a fun show.\\n\\n\r\nSo in other words, this was hardly a compelling drama or nail-bitingly suspenseful series it's just a superficially entertaining show where you'll laugh at the funny parts and be moved by the more touching parts, it's nothing you'll want to write a college thesis about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nYou can definitely expect lots and lots of characters! I don't particularly go for shows with an infinite array of characters because it's too easy to lose focus of the actual plot and get all engrossed with &ldquo;favourite&rdquo; characters! Besides seeing too many faces and hearing a lot of names, gives me headache. This show does try it's best to keep it all around the five or so central figures, so this isn't as bad....and Sven does try to keep things light and funny which I could appreciate.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWorth it or not?\\n\r\nI liked it, I thought it was a good show and they kept it light and funny, except for a few poignant scenes. I would recommend this show to people...but not without making sure they're going to be really objective about it, otherwise they just be wasting their time to wind up as another disappointed viewer.",

            "content": "Ka-boom! Ka-boom! Ka-boom!\r\nA plethora of evocative, vibrant fireworks erupt in the gloomy skies of a particularly somber city. In the streets of said city, two forces empathetically collide together and immediately disconnect again and again, like two pendulums swinging in different directions, as brilliant, multicolored sparks soar all over the place. The conflict is one between two fighters that appear to be engaged in a fierce duel to the death, the animosity for each other intoxicating. One fighter possesses the look of a weathered wanderer with his tattered black jacket in tow, and he holds a gun in his hand while the other fighter, donninga polished white jacket, grips a glowing sword, akin to a lightsaber. While slabs of concrete are torn to shreds, while entire houses are reduced to smithereens, the movements of these two alleyway brawlers are effortless, elegant, and expeditious, more a resemblance of Baryshnikov than Andre the Giant. As the showdown reaches its climax, the weapons of the two fighters, the gun and the lightsaber-like sword, are pressed against one another, the sparks frenziedly bouncing off them. The man in the white jacket bellows at his opponent, \u201cYour eyes! That woman! She\u2019s got you! You\u2019re under that witch\u2019s spell!\u201d A cutaway to a woman\u2019s body, horrifically pale and bloodied, occurs before he raises his sword in preparation for a lethal downward strike. We then witness the aftereffect of his attack; we see his opponent, the fighter in the black jacket, howling in pain, spiraling to the ground in defeat.\\n\\n\r\nThis, my friend, is the first thirty-five seconds of Black Cat.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one thing that this series can accomplish, it\u2019s the ability to hook you into its framework, to really galvanize the audience into discovering what it\u2019s all about. Black Cat\u2019s theme song, Yorico\u2019s \u201cDaia no Hana\u201d, does a fantastic job at this. This opening unveils a story centered on the black-coated wanderer (Train Heartnet) seeking a purpose in life, attempting to escape the psychological stronghold placed on him by the white-coated swordsman (Creed Diskenth) and the organization which once employed both of them (Chronos, the governmental entity comprised entirely of assassins for hire). In a strange twist of fate, Train encounters others that either desire to live freely like him or that want to encourage him in the right direction (Sven Vollfied, Saya Minatsuki, Eve, and Rinslet Walker). The remainder of the theme song is dedicated to presenting the obstacles these characters face as well as the friends (and enemies) they come across along the way. Musically speaking, \u201cDaia no Hana\u201d is a triumph, explosive at times and somber in other moments, a virtuoso of tonal shifts. Really, it\u2019s among the biggest highlights of Black Cat\u2019s soundtrack. Crafted by composer Taku Iwasaki (who would later create the OST for Gurren Lagann), the music in Black Cat is surprisingly sober, a relaxed and low-key combination of folk blues, classical, and piano compositions (The music that appears in the eye catches are particularly smooth). However, the bombasticness, the over-the-top energy, that Taku Iwasaki would later be acclaimed for, shines through in songs like \u201cAccettami\u201d and \u201cYajuu no Chi\u201d but especially \u201cKuroki Neko\u201d (Train\u2019s character theme), a memorably grandiose and overpowering orchestral track. In contrast to the mood Iwasaki already established, Black Cat\u2019s first ED, PUPPEYPET\u2019s \u201cNamidaboshi\u201d, is silly, immature, and even infantile at times. However, the second ED (Matsuda Ryouji\u2019s \u00a0\u201cKutsuzure\u201d) is much more fitting; it possesses a soulful, melancholic feel to it.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the soundtrack applies a sleek yet vibrant atmosphere to the show, Black Cat\u2019s amazing aesthetics provide a stylishly visceral element. Produced by Studio Gonzo, this show\u2019s character designs are mercurial in terms of quality (It\u2019s strikingly obvious when it\u2019s great and when it\u2019s not), and the animation overall is fairly standard for the most part. Sure, the show\u2019s CGI is simply horrifying (a Gonzo trademark) but Black Cat compensates with its beautiful back lighting and enthusiastic color palette. However, it\u2019s the streaks of artistic brilliance that causes Black Cat to visually stand out the most. In one scene, a particularly opulent character showcases an outfit of Unmoving Plaid, a creative move reminiscent of Gankutsuou, an earlier Gonzo project. More than anything else, Black Cat\u2019s fight scenes are where it unleashes the fullest extent of its visual excellence; they\u2019re almost always intense and jaw-droppingly stylish, the embodiment of cinematic creativity. The fights that personally stand out are the ones late in the series, like Eve vs Leon, the final showdown between Train and Creed, and especially Sephiria vs Creed (In that particular fight, there\u2019s an amazing shift between during the battle and after; the showdown\u2019s result is portrayed in black and white while the fight itself is overflowing in color). To be honest, it was Black Cat that first inspired me to value the art of cinematography.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWow. This sucker sure is heavy,\u201d - Saya Minatsuki (episode 5)\\n\\n\r\nYou can possess the world\u2019s most hardboiled soundtrack and dark-colored designs but if the writers of a TV show can\u2019t craft a consistently exciting drama, then everything falls apart. Just look at Deadman Wonderland. Black Cat, on the other hand, is a master of mood execution. What I mean is that when drama is needed, it is established and executed at a high level of quality, like episode ten\u2019s chase scene. When Black Cat desires to frighten the audience, it elevates its Horror Factor to an unprecedented level, like Train\u2019s nightmare in episode 14. Admittedly, this show falters when it involves emotional appeal but Black Cat compensates with scenes like Beluga (a Chronos operative) and his roaring rampage of revenge in episode 15; it\u2019s among Black Cat\u2019s most poignant moments. Sadly, the show\u2019s forays into comedy are even worse. Early on, Black Cat maintained a generally unremarkable yet balanced sense of humor; during serious scenes, the jokes were never repetitive nor underwhelming. Later on, Black Cat\u2019s comedic success devolves into oversaturated mediocrity with a knack for tiresome, unoriginal gags (Remember The Looney Tunes Rule: when you\u2019re in the air, don\u2019t look down).\\n\\n\r\nThere are quite a few areas in which Black Cat hardly qualifies as perfect but its characterization is where the show is perhaps the most deficient in. Black Cat performs commendably at its usage of recurring side characters, allotting them sufficient screen time, depth, and individuality, like Petra Ghoul, Annette, and Tanya. However, Black Cat\u2019s overall characterization leaves much to be desired. With notable exceptions to three fantastic characters (who I\u2019ll mention later), the members of Black Cat\u2019s cast can be filed into five categories: consistently good-but-not-great (Train and Eve), good-but-not-great characters with shrinking importance (Rinslet, Leon, Sephiria, and Woodney), fairly worthwhile characters with decent amount of depth (Tearju, Dr. Kanzaki, Igor Planter, Tim, and Gyanza), terrible (Mason, Kyoko, 85% of Chronos, and the entire Sweepers Alliance)....and River Zastory.\\n\\n\r\n(I won\u2019t mince words here: River Zastory is unarguably one of the most pointless characters in all of anime. There is not one thing that he contributed to the show that someone else didn\u2019t already contribute at a higher level of quality. Train, Creed, Eve, and Sephiria are stronger. Sven, Woodney, and almost everyone else have a greater sense of humor. Even the show\u2019s pet mascot is more important than him. River Zastory has no chemistry or bond with anyone. He has zero character development and depth. He doesn\u2019t even have personality traits. If there\u2019s one word that can be used to describe River Zastory, it\u2019s \u201cexpendable\u201d).\\n\\n\r\nWhile River Zastory (and the show\u2019s characters in general) represent Black Cat at its worst, there are three members of the cast that allot a sense of respectability to the group as a whole, and one of them as Saya Minatsuki (voiced by Caitlin Glass). She\u2019s an experienced bounty hunter (or \u201cSweeper\u201d as this is what they are known by in Black Cat) whose relaxed nature belies her frightening accuracy with \u00a0her handgun. A free spirit more than anything else, Saya influences Train to embrace his individuality and to not be concerned with how others (namely Creed) wish for him to live. The show was only graced with her presence for six episodes but Saya became a fan favorite due to her witty observations, her likability, her competitive spirit, and her silliness.\\n\\n\r\nSven Vollfied is another of Black Cat\u2019s finest characters, and my personal favorite of the bunch. A cross between Trigun\u2019s Nicholas D. Wolfwood (his sarcasm and snarky brilliance) and Cowboy Bebop\u2019s Jet Black (his fashion sense and traditionalist values), Sven is a chain-smoking ex-cop with unbelievable bad luck, chain to an occupation he once referred to as being a glorified nomad. Brandon Potter, in his role as Sven, delivers a raspy, worn-out baritone that\u2019s perfect for Black Cat\u2019s green-haired sweeper; it\u2019s as if Potter was born for this role. In a show where characters are defined almost entirely by how physically imposing they are, Sven gets by with his gadget-filled suitcase, his superb quick thinking, and a nifty ability to glimpse into the future. Ultimately, Sven Vollfied is a paragon of natural charm, the embodiment of smooth, and a richly developed character\u2026. but he doesn\u2019t come close to Creed Diskenth.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, Creed (brought to life by a scenery-chewing, show-stopping performance from Chris Patton) doesn\u2019t look like much, just another maniacal villain aiming to take over the world. Yet, there\u2019s more to Creed than that. Throughout the course of Black Cat, we witness a broken human being mistreated and dismissed by those above him. We witness a man who seeks to change the world for the better but devolves into one of the monsters he despised in the first place (Creed\u2019s ambition is pure yet his intentions are not). We witness a man, who wasn\u2019t too mentally stable to begin with, spiral further and further into the very depths of madness. We witness a charismatic leader establish a tight-knit circle of followers and we observe his utter disdain for virtually all of them. We witness a man\u2019s overly obsessive pursuit for the approval and praise of another, and we observe the man\u2019s realization of his pursuit being a pointless one. Finally, we witness a man\u2019s journey towards redemption; it is a rather hasty journey but a journey nonetheless. Compared to Black Cat\u2019s other characters, Creed Diskenth is a diamond in the rough, the proverbial needle in the haystack, a ray of light in a cave of darkness.\\n\\n\r\nThough there is much to criticize Black Cat\u2019s cast for, what I appreciate most about them is the show\u2019s ability to frame the characters in representing the various ideologies that are established in the plot. Zagine (Train\u2019s mentor) and Creed passionately advocate for Social Darwinism while Sephiria pontificates on the societal effects of a corrupt government. Eve introduces an unconventional outlook on pets (that these animals are forced into a new and unfamiliar environment against their will) while the Sweepers Alliance criticizes the government\u2019s nonchalant treatment of them. All of this (and more) are woven together to collectively enhance the central storyline of revenge and redemption.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it was this speciality, the gift for presenting an array of ideologies, that gradually dissolved into nothingness as Black Cat\u2019s runtime increased, along with many of the series\u2019 other noteworthy attributes. While the show was never one without flaws, Black Cat, at its absolute apex (from episodes 1 to 12, specifically episodes 8 to 12), achieved in magnifying its greatest features and minimizing its shortcomings to the best of its abilities. It is immediately after Train\u2019s second big showdown against Creed in episode 12 (they would have one more before the series concluded) that Black Cat devolves from a gritty, multilayered action-noir epic into a half-hearted, by-the-numbers beat-em-up comedy. After episode 12, Black Cat possesses a few glimmers of brilliance, like the transcendent episode 14 and Charden\u2019s character arc, but ultimately it\u2019s not enough to overcome the phenomenal deprivation of everything that made this show special.\\n\\n\r\nTo deploy a term invented by MyAnimeList user CodeBlazeFate, Black Cat is a poster boy victim of \u201cSecond Half Syndrome\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nJust when you think that Black Cat\u2019s latter portion can\u2019t become more of a disgrace (after the pointless filler episode, the useless Tao monsters, River Zastory\u2019s entire existence, and episode 20\u2019s uber-convenient deus ex machina), the Eden Project Arc commences. This is what Black Cat\u2019s last four episodes are dedicated to; this is something that the show has been anticipating since the very beginning but you can\u2019t resist wishing it were better executed. The Eden Project Arc is centered on Eve\u2019s desires to be understood and to find somewhere she belongs yet she\u2019s utilized as a plot device, a placeholder if you will, instead of a character with real emotions. The Eden Project Arc bombards its runtime with an overflow of unnecessary archetypes instead of simply selecting a handful of important characters and providing them with their own individual reasons for destroying the evil operation. The Eden Project Arc possesses an abundance of Biblical references (mostly involving the Book of Genesis) but it devotes its runtime to \u201cmaking the weapon of destruction look really cool and do really cool things\u201d instead of allotting substance and nuance to the references. The utterly irredeemable cop-out near the end serves as the embodiment of everything the Eden Project Arc did wrong, the cherry on top of a perfect disaster.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Cat, in a medium where action shows are a dime a dozen, has become a forgotten relic of the mid-2000s, ruthlessly criticized on the rare occasion in which its name pops up. The majority of those that viewed Black Cat immediately dismissed it as a Cowboy Bebop knockoff (kind of true) instead of appreciating it for what it is. As a result, Black Cat is wandering aimlessly outside of MAL\u2019s Top 1000, its fans few and far between. As one of the only advocates for this hidden gem, I\u2019d argue that Black Cat, despite its shortcomings, is wildly underrated; it\u2019s much more creative, intense, and complex than people give it credit for. Black Cat exists as an interesting revision of the Cowboy Bebop formula, as a brilliant representation of Gonzo at the height of its aesthetic glory, and as one of the greatest shonen epics you\u2019ll ever encounter. With that, I encourage you to not allow the opinions of others to prevent you from giving this show a chance. Black Cat is not a kitty that will bite you.",

It gives you the pleasure of a good laugh at its gags, moderately suspenseful as the story unfolds and with certain scenes, maybe a tear or two may shed. I found this thoroughly enjoyable. \r\nThe story revolves around Train Heartnet, a.k.a Black Cat. Chained down as a professional assassin, Black Cat is expected to adhere strictly to the orders of Chronos Organization. Betrayal to the groups ideals is unforgivable and leads only to death. Train lived his life, killing professionally without a second thought until he meetsa 'Sweeper', Minatsuki Saya. \\n\r\nBeing completely free and independent Saya believes strongly in choice, whether in taking charge of ones own life or choosing to take others'. With this contradiction, Train begins to doubt his methods and slowly yearns to search for more than cold murder. \\n\r\nBlack Cat portrays different meanings of justice, honour and life as Train escapes from the clutches of indomitable Chronos and obsessive ex-partner to a &quot;mercenarious&quot; life of a sweeper.",

I noticed only the people who rated this about and 8 or up knows why. When its completely obvious why he changed. Also the anime has a plot, then another two plots in one. They did it all how i wanted them too. Maybe they did rush it a little at the end, but it still made sense. The animation was really good. I loved all the characters. To me they are the best part. I really dont remember any charactersthat didnt contribute anything. Some of the chronos numbers really didnt but thats all. EVERYone did something. The reason this anime sparked in my book, was that it was Shounen yet it wasnt anything like Bleach and all those other ones, that are pure fighting. The characters sparked a lot, and a huge change from the manga in art. Really it irritates me how under rated this anime is. There wasnt much wrong with it. \\n\r\nI would suggest watching it all over the other bounty animes. Like Cowboy Bebop, truelly i dont know why that one is that great.",

            "content": "You know what I was told? I was told that Arthropod venom is one of the worst and most deadly venoms out there, but I guess science batted an eye on the more so deadly competitor known as nostalgia. Ever since I was little, and much like every other Arabian kid, a TV channel by the name of \u201cSpacetoon\u201d was what made all of those kids' childhood, \u201cThe channel of future youngsters\u201d was the slogan, and it was no stretch. Among the many classics they used to air was \u201cBlack Cat\u201d, with its nostalgic opening theme song and key characters, you couldn't call yourself afan if you haven't at least rewatched the series more than twice and recall the chronological order of events by heart. But over the +10 years that have passed since those simpler days, the plot, in general, had already faded from my memory and it was time to revisit the nostalgic classic once again and see if it holds up to today's standards.\\n\\n\r\n- Story (7.0/10):\\n\r\nHeavily reliant on mythology and religious references, a story set on a post-war setting where conflict is still being fueled for what the losses that have already been suffered from weren't enough. A secret organization by the name of Chronos reigns from the shadows in pursuit of true peace by the means of blood and assassination, standing on the lead of its ranks numbered agents that go from 1 and increasing reaching number 13, that would be Train Heartnet, one of the protagonists of the series that seeks freedom and takes from Chronos a false escape from his intent of murder, little did he know soon enough that he will be freed with the help of Saya Minatsuki, a sweeper that helped him see the world in a different perspective.\\n\r\nUnlike the real-world intuitive definition of a sweeper, sweepers here are people, much like freelance bounty hunters that arrest criminals alive in a manner that contradicts the methods of Chronos but also not completely oppose them. That was pretty much the set up for the story without spoiling any vital information.\\n\r\nOne thing they nailed here is the balance of comedy and action that very few shows manage to achieve (ex; One Piece), a running theme here seems to be cat humor, so, for cat lovers out there, you're in for some minimalistic chibi cat figures, in the other hand comes the badassness, everything from the cool poses, epic entrances, badass black cloaks and guns, enough to draw in your interest in fights. However, it seems they went the wrong turn with that, most fights are just a mess of complicated poorly juxtaposed frames that barely make sense, it makes it hard to keep up and follow what's going on, for the most part, add to that the frequently low FPS moments that make my potato computer running Minecraft shaders look like a champ.\\n\r\nOne misconception in anime is that if a show is fast-paced and straightforward, it creates opportunities for better story execution and character development, that is if done right. Black Cat suffers from consistency in pacing, it's fast yes, but faster than the flow of the story. The main quest is about revenge and redemption after all, but it doesn't leave much space for side quests to be fleshed out, and thus, every other side episode so to speak, feels like watching a horrible filler from the deepest pits of Naruto Shippuden's filler hell.\\n\\n\r\n- Art (7.5/10):\\n\r\nPersonally, I adore the art style, I would describe it as that of a vampire-ish dark vibe, heavy on sharp edges but not quite as sharp as Code Geass's character's chins, God lord, those are deadly (Not to say that Code Geass is a horrible show, like seriously, if you haven't watched yet, what are you waiting for?). Having the show portrays a light-hearted comedy, it doesn't fall short on it being dark, remember, this show is about assassins, bounty hunters, a world of conflict, and if the title \u201cBlack Cat\u201d wasn't enough to emphasize, the art style surely does. The color palette is dark, but unlike other shows where it gets so dark that it's difficult to see anything on the screen, Black Cat knew when to stop. Those mix of aspects created a certain atmosphere to the story that you don't get from any other shows, I would say, it's the closest you can get to the Resident Evil 4 video game (you know what greatness you're getting now).\\n\\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\\n\r\nWhilst typing this, I'm still on an intense debate in my head whether I find the Arabic version of the opening theme song or the original Japanese version the better one, nostalgia is a biased factor here, but that doesn't make the other any less good. I mean, it's \u201cI can listen to this all day\u201d material going as far as \u201cplay this in my funeral\u201d type of song. What I love about it is how soft and light it starts out and how quietly strong it gets near the end, makes for a perfect preparation to get you in the mood for some Train wrecking (that was intended). I'm glad they kept the same opening theme song throughout the whole run, with updated visuals midway the show, and two great ending theme songs to kind of cal you down at the end of each episode.\\n\r\nI listened to both the English dubbed and subbed versions before choosing which one to go by, spoiler alert, it was the English sub, however, that didn't make the dubbed version look any less immersive, the main voices were spectacular, but I still wanted to go by the original version to kind of experience it the way it was made. So, for those who are deciding which one to watch, I recommend both, you might as well watch both alternating between one and other any time you see fit.\\n\\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\\n\r\nCharacters make half the show they say, and they couldn't be wrong, I mean look at Taboo Tatoo, that's what you get when you populate a story with potential with shallow characters, absolutely terrible. Black Cat, on the other hand, did a decent job keeping things as neutral as they are.\\n\r\nLiterally, every single character had a great development throughout, the initial Train is not the Train five episodes later, and the same Train is not the Train of later either, and that doesn't go for only main characters.\\n\r\nThere wasn't any annoying pitiful figure that made you snap out every time they spoke, I liked every single one of them and even had my favorites as well. Buuuuuuut, an issue with lacking backstories and plausible plot holes did leave their marks, some characters were indeed fleshed out but only compared to the neglected individuals, I'm not asking for a focusing ark for every single fraction of dirt. A character needs motive and purpose, it needs to follow an ideology or else, it falls under the nouveau-rich category from the background crowd.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\\n\r\nNostalgia is a drug, I remember watching this show like it was like no other, it's safe to say that it was way below my expectations. Did it age well, pr-oba--b-l-y???! I'd feel guilty of admitting it, there were strong moments, but there were also weak moments that didn't live up to what I remember.\\n\r\nI still laughed at the same exact old jokes (it seems parts of me never got old), I still liked the characters and found the story mildly interesting.\\n\r\nAt the start of my rewatch, I went all out, a barking nostalgia dog claiming that I can binge it in no time, but the effect of the drug wore off near the two-digit episodes, and the rest was history. A humble number of episodes were just plain boring, \u201cI fell asleep while watching X\u201d material. Not my proudest come back in any respect, it seems I learned to disregard nostalgia the hard way, but the actual good parts were just enough refreshment to get me all strong and recovered.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall (7.6/10):\\n\r\nAs far as shounen shows, Black Cat had its unique take on the genre, nothing revolutionary, but it certainly is way different than your modern shounen shows (My Hero Academia, Black Clover...). If you want to revisit what old shows used to be like, Black Cat does a good job retaining that fashion and atmosphere, the feelings that you're sent back to 2005 for 20 minutes, that's one approach to time travel. Now, for you people who have nostalgic memories to the show, please proceed with caution, the show that blew your mind back then may never feel the same, so tone down the expectations, but don't make my words scare you, our little nostalgic friend here still has its old special charm.",

            "content": "Well, first of all, thank you for reading my review. Let's get on with it, shall we?\r\nAnimation:\r\nThe animation is okay, but it gets better during the action scenes. But during a few battle scenes, there aren't backgrounds, it just shows the characters brawling it out. \r\nMusic:\r\nThe music is quite good, it usually fits the mood and all. The opening is pretty awesome if you ask me, it's one of my favorites. The first ending theme is quite funny, and I always find myself thinking \"This is pretty funny\" and start laughing just a little bit. The second ending took me a little while to getused to, but the scene with all the characters is quite well done, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nI find the story quite interesting. I really like both Sven's and Train's side of the story, and it's also enjoyable to find more on their backgrounds. I was surprised that some of the characters did die, I really thought that it would be a fighting series without actual deaths. Of course, the deaths aren't a bad thing. I found the main characters appealing and a great fit for a Shonen anime. The only thing I don't like is that absolutely none of the episodes are the same as the manga, but it gets the basic story through.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Judgement:\\n\r\nPros- Fine Music, Great Characters, Keeps a similar story\\n\r\nCons- Differs from the manga, Animation needs improvement",

The series seem to really like to jump around with plots, which does keep the series \"fast paced\", but it also makes the storyline seem annoyingly choppy. The series was intended for 50 episodes, but was cut short at 23, which is really odd considering how series are usually 26. There is a noticeable jump in the series where its obvious that there could of dragged on.\r\nMusic-8/10-The OP is pretty good, the happyish ED really gives away the factthat the series is always gonna have happy ending. The soundtrack is very similar to Getbackers, and is almost as good.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-6/10-The fight scenes are okay, but sometimes everything seems like the artist was high, for the colors of the scenes would just be so random. The ART is average, with some average to below average animation, those lame freeze frames.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-7/10-Its like a lot getbackers with the fact that the &quot;main&quot; characters are two guys who have different special techniques or abilities, that are trying to stop crime, while trying to earn money. The series introduces a lot of characters and just like getbackers they often meet each other. There is character development, but it usually seems to rushed or calculated.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Value-7/10-This series is pretty cool, but doesn't seem extremely special or great. You can build up a lot of excitement through some arcs, but the excitement just dies right after every arc.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-7/10",

You will still enjoy the twist and turns of how the plot was played. But I am totally disappointed on how \"fast\" the stories were. It's like it was rushed. It could have been better if they would have at least 40 or more episodes just to stretch out the details. It's like I just watched a long movie, not a series. \r\nThe art and sounds are good enough.\r\nWhen it comes to character, since the story, in my opinion,was rushed, they weren't able to give the characters depth on why they were like that. \\n\r\nEverything was compressed in an episode and all willing to do everything after meeting them once. The shifting of black cat's character was not smoothly shifted as well. It's like he turned 180 degrees after just a few conversation.\\n\\n\r\nBut still, like what I said earlier, nonetheless, this is still a good anime to enjoy. I would still recommended it, esp to those doesn't like much talks but more on to action. You will not regret watching this.",

            "content": "Black Cat! What an awesome synopsis with a great story! These were my first thoughts on the series. In the beginning, I was very impressed. The first few episodes were great, entertaining. Unfortunately, it all just fell apart into a giant mush of boring side stories, awful character morals, and poorly designed villains. \r\n             I like to start my reviews off with the good aspects of a series, so let's go over a few. The opening song wasn't too bad.The animation was average. I did find myself enjoying a few of the characters. Sven had excellent voice acting. Saiya and Kyouko  were enjoyable characters. There was so much potential!\\n\\n\r\n            Let's skip the point... I just, wow. I was enjoying Black Cat a lot, but it was just written so poorly. It was about cool assassins and bounty hunters, then they became morally illogical, neighborhood watch style of characters.\\n\r\n                \"We have the power to kill this terrible murderous rapist with super powers, but let's turn him over to the police so he can break of jail for the 6th time.\"\\n\r\n            Of course, this is just an example, not a spoiler, but you understand how frustrating it became. Not only that, but the story just kept flipping to awful side stories and introducing useless characters with no relevance whatsoever. Most of the villains had ridiculous logic, or lack thereof. Not to mention, this series actually has 24 episodes. Mal probably didn't include the 24th episode because it was downright terrible. You could hardly tell what was going on at all. \\n\\n\r\n            All and all, I will not be watching this series again, and I'm not even that proud to have finished it. It's too violent for kids, too illogical for adults.. it's just a flop. If you enjoy far-fetched, wild adventures, with ministories that don't add to the main story, you might enjoy Black Cat, but it definitely wasn't for me.\\n\\n\r\n3/10 Sweepers. Hopefully enough to sweep it under the rug :') !",

            "content": "Ok, so before I have told you that I\u2019m not crazy about girls and guns genre, but I guess this could be considered guys and guns. Now in this, it\u2019s a bit different except the concept was the same, guy gets into a organization as pretty much a hired gun and goes around assassinating who the organization doesn\u2019t like. The thing I like about this show is that it doesn\u2019t start there, and most of that is actually back story. This is about him getting out of the group and learning what he himself wanted. The character that actually helps him figure this out is\u2018new\u2019 code was Saya but it really annoyed me they killed her off so quickly. \\n\\n\r\nNow I do wonder a lot about why Saya is a big part of Train\u2019s life and why he goes out for revenge. He only knows her for about 2 or three days so why does he go crazy when she dies? Is it because she is the only person he cared about that died in front of him? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case because they show he has seen others he cares about dieing before then so why? Give us a bit more to work on with her please. I liked the show but I hate that they add Saya only to kill her off in the first 2 to 3 episodes. It\u2019s just not fair to both Train and the watcher. Once I got into her character, then I\u2019m hurt by how she is no longer there. Though there flash backs, we don\u2019t see much of how she affects Train much. It somewhat makes me feel that the first five episodes were wasted on the so called relationship between Train and Saya that had no real reason for being because it wasn\u2019t much of a relationship. \\n\\n\r\nThe fighting was rather interesting though sometimes it bothered me that we only got flashes of the fight and not a whole fight. It did get better after a while though. I am also don\u2019t really like the sudden change in Train\u2019s character that seems to mess with me. He all of a sudden is so childish in front of strangers. It\u2019s a complete turn around from how he was in the first few episode without any space in between for growth. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the animation feels much like an opening to a James Bond opening though it has a bit of the same flare as a new-vole in the beginning. And then it cuts that and goes into comic fest with jokes and funny site gags. It has a nice way of taking you into the story line for the drama, then hitting you over the head with a bat continually until it again goes back into Drama mode. But every battle works well with the next, someone studied well when it came to camera angles. Gonzo isn\u2019t known for great animation but this one is pretty nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nThe music has many different feels for each scene from the hunting chant whenever Greed (aka Seductive obsessed freak!) to the playful sounds of walking down the street that you normally get for comical affect. Most of them work well with the characters but once in a while\u2026 we get something that sounds rather bad or not fitting the area.\\n",

            "content": "WARRING - Can have a little spoiling\r\n--14 Episodes Watched--\r\nBlackCat or 'kuroneko' in romaji is a great anime with a lot of action and funny moments. Train Heartnet, codename BrakoKato, is a boy around 20 years old, whose family were killed by his after-teacher. When his teacher murdered, he became an assassin whose bullets were faster than his mind. In the short begin of the story, he met a girl called Saya, from who his transformation came to effect. He resigned  in assassination and became sweeper on his own will. \r\nBlackCat is anime mostly based on action. There's a lot of cool-posing BlackCat situations, anda lot of fights, evasions, fun and indeed a lot of ... really big individualities: from a little childish and shy Train, to a very obsession Creed ... in midsts there's one head-aired person, journalist with passion and 'ohime-sama' who bare bio-weapon's burden. However ... some parts of characters looks like copied from other animes. For example Eve, bio-girl, looks almost identically like Yami-chan from ToLoveRu anime series. Kyouko looks like Kyoko from ToLoveRu too ... so lame in my opinion but from the other side - those 'copies' are copies of the best chars, so I can forgive this little 'defect'.\\n\\n\r\nMusic ... it is the best thing at this anime. I love music during battles, during some funny moments ... and thing about opening and ending ... just love it. When protagonists are fighting there's a lot of good tunes, when they're doing funny thing there's good music for it ... and when there's no music ... that's good moment to be so too.\\n\\n\r\nSummary ... I enjoyed this anime a lot and hope it will continue a little bit more (14 episodes watched). Some moments of this anime are sad, some are happy but always there's not a 'boring time'. This anime is for peoples who like action, some dramatical scenes (mostly there's a one significant), a lot of darkness, insanity and add-ons of some funny scenes ;). I really recommend this anime for all those who think that mystery will work with fun.\\n\\n\r\nGreetings 9/10 from me.\\n\\n\r\n27/09/09\\n\r\nI've just finished watching this anime, and I can say, that it wasn't as good as I thought for the first time when I saw it. I did not change my mind about characters, sounds ... but I lower the grade of story, art and enjoyment as occurs. Why? There's no any logical sense between two close episodes. In the one episode train is doing something and that thing is not continuing in the next episode - you don't know what exactly happened!! About art: so ... further episodes, maybe after 15, have some charges at the background like \"colorful lines\" - it really annoys. And about enjoyment - heh - I think that I shouldn't tell that when the art and the story sucks sometimes, enjoyment is lower. \\n\\n\r\nSo in summary: After all, 'KuroNeko' degraded by me to 7 points of max 10.",

It's like a totally different anime after that. The producer might have hit his head or something. The beginning was very dark and cool, the main character, Train, was brilliant. A cold-blooded assassin who was starting to get a softer side, because of a girl he met. He was so serious compared to the other crazy characters. Even if I dislike this kind of psycho acting in an anime, I thought the jokes were very funny. Allthese were a sign of an extremely good anime. Bad impression. It gets so stupid and Train's character is RUINED. The mysterious, cool and serious guy is starting to act like a retard. They want to show us that he totally changed, but they could have done that in a more decent way. I'm so disappointed right now. And not because it's a retarded anime. I saw many like that. But the beginning was too brilliant for all to turn out like this. It's really a shame...\\n\\n\r\nedit after finishing it: I still have the same opinion, but I must say, the last few episodes were kinda good, and saved the whole anime. They stop acting like retards, the jokes are funny again. So I try to think of the middle part as an accident.  The story had a great potential, but oh well, it was still nice...",

The art was great, I loved the story and background that went with the main character (Train). It was a great set up for my kind of anime (\"dark\" or something like that).\r\nThen the plot changed (I won't say how so I won't spoil it for the people who haven't watched it yet). But after that I absolutely couldn't watch any more, and now I have to hate this anime. What happened definitely changed the kind of anime it was set up as.\r\nI do recommend this animeto people who like kinda intense fighting and cool plots, but I don't think the entire anime will be enjoyable.",

            "content": "Gah~ Ceray's Review Time (procrastination in disguise)! Anyway, this is the review for the anime Black Cat. The anime is about Black Cat, also known as Train Heartnet, who once was an assassin for the organization Chronos. Due to events that happen in the story, Train quits being an assassin to becoming a sweeper/bounty hunter.\rPlot: Since I haven't read the manga (yet) I can't compare the plots, I do know, however, that the storyline has changed a bit, however that doesn't really affect the story. The main part of the story consists of Train more or less wanting to confront a ghost from his pastand this takes up roughly a little less than half the series. Though it's good that Black Cat had other small subplots, it felt rushed at times, as if they wanted to get straight to the action, which took away from the enjoyment. That aside, the story was wonderful, and kept me anxious for the next episode (which is why I finished so quickly), wanting to know what would happen to Train and company next.\\n\rScore: 7/10\\n\\n\rAnimation: If you want me to express what I though about the animation for Black Cat in one word that word would be \"PWETTY.\" Not pretty, but pwetty. The animation is smooth and does look all.... icky. Yeah. If there's one thing about the animation that I have to point out is that Train looks younger, a few years younger. I mean, he's twenty three in the manga, but in the anime he looks nineteen (age change could be because of the changed time line...). What else should I say? The ending animation for the first twelve episodes is amusing, but only until... episode eight, but honestly I was missing it after a while. But, that's not the point, and the point is that Black Cat's animation nice... No reused animation, as far as I saw. \\n\rScore:10/10\\n\\n\rSound: Ah~ The background music, it's music to my ears. The music pretty much matches the mood of the current scene, for example during the dramatic scenes some sort of opera sounding music plays giving you that... ominous (?) feeling. I absolutely adored the piano version of the song Konoyo no Uta, which plays at certain points in the series. The opening theme, Daia no Hana, is amazing as well... However, the first ending theme Namidaboshi sometimes doesn't match the mood of the episode that it's ending... \\n\\n\rNow usually, I don't watch subs, this is because I'd rather hear it in English, with Black Cat, I had no choice but to watch it subbed... And how wonderful it was. Takashi Kondo pulls Train off extremely well, sounding one way when serious and totally lighthearted another way. Also Shin'ichiro Miki makes Creed sound absolutely obsessed, which is good... I guess...Cept, I dun like Creed...\\n\rScore:9/10\\n\\n\rCharacter: Ah. Do I have to put this? I totally love the characters of Black Cat... Even Creed, who scares me a lot. They aren't all that different than their manga counterparts, which is... good, and you can really tell the difference between then, Train is Train, Tanya is Tanya and Creed.... is obsessed.\\n\rScore: 9/10\\n\\n\rEnjoyment: ... Must I explain?... Well... I sorta watched the whole series for Train... So... yeah...\\n\rScore: 9/10\\n\\n\\n\rOverall:\\n\\n\rYay!: Animation is smooth and pwetty. Smooth animation is good on Ceray's glasses ridden eyes.\\n\rNay!: Plot was way too rushed. Pull it out at least ten or so more episoes.\\n\rScore: 9/10\\n",

            "content": "First of all, to be honest with you all. I did not enjoy this series as much as i thought i would like it mainly because of the plot and how it got fairly rushed in the end.\r\nStory - The beginning part of the story i thought was very well made, it was very dark, mysterious but not scary at all for those who dislike scary storylines. But after a while the plot just seem dull and unoriginal. Typical protagonist trying to save the world, trying to protect his friends and trying to get revenge, all these types of storylines has been overused, if BlackCat had a better storyline, i believe it would have been better.\\n\\n\r\nArt - I liked the design of the characters, especially Train during the beginning of the series. So i have nothing to complain about the art category.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Not much to review about sound, but i have to admit the gunshots were pretty real. Also, the voice actors fitted the role very well, especially Eve and Sven. The OP was quite nice, fitted into the anime quite nice.. Forgot how the ED goes so i can't review that.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- One of the things that makes Black Cat enjoyable are the wide variety of characters. It is quite amusing watching Jenos and Rins yell at each other. So if your looking for some humorous characters, Black Cat has that for you. The one thing that i thought lacked in the character section was the sudden change of Train Heartnet. Although it says half a year has passed, I'm pretty sure people other then me wants to watch the process of him from a deadly assassin to a overly energetic young man. Another reason i suggest Black Cat was rushed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Black Cat is actually quite enjoyable if you do not care about the unoriginal storyline seeing that the characters are greatly designed and there are many great fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- Overall i would say Black Cat is a fair made anime that fails to achieve better due to the lack of storyline and how it is quite rushed. Although i say this, i still enjoyed Black Cat to it's full potential.",

            "content": "I\u2019m gonna be straight here \u2013 Black Cat is one of the most disappointing anime I\u2019ve ever watched. It\u2019s been two years since I watched this anime and I\u2019m still a little bitter at how much potential remained unrealized at its end.\r\nBlack Cat is about this assassin named Train Heartnet (hey, at least he escaped whoever named all the characters in Geass). Or wait, it\u2019s about this secret bio-weapon disguised as a loli named Eve. Actually no, it\u2019s about this bounty hunter dude named Sven. Oh, wait, never mind, I remember, it\u2019s actually about the villain, Creed, who has a hard-on for Train. No hangon, it might\u2019ve been about the organization that Train worked for, Chronos\u2026\\n\\n\r\nSee, I\u2019m writing all of this as if the abundance of disparate elements in the plot is a bad thing, but the thing is, the story started out with a ton of potential. The first four or five episodes do a great job of tying all these characters together in a sensible and, dare I say, a captivating manner. Seriously, the beginning of this show is excellent. It\u2019s exciting and a bit dark without getting too edgy or angsty, the characters all have good synergy and play off of each other very well, and the pacing is near-perfect.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then the timeskip happens.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll try to be brief and not spoil anything here, but suffice it to say that a certain main character\u2019s personality does a complete 180 after the timeskip, and virtually zero explanation for the change is given to the viewer, outside of occasional scattered hints that refer to certain events that happened pre-timeskip. This is unfortunately only the beginning, as the rest of the anime devolves into a giant mess of hastily-introduced and poorly-fleshed-out characters, a distinct lack of focus on core plot points that the initial episodes tried to establish, and a ridiculous number of plot contrivances that attempt to reconcile this lack of focus, to no avail. The pacing is haphazard at best and has all the grace of a one-legged donkey at worst. The only relatively consistent character throughout the show is Sven; everyone else undergoes obscenely rushed character \u201cdevelopment\u201d, which is really just most of the characters overreacting to major events and, much like aforementioned main character, completely flipping the script on their personalities and becoming the exact opposite of who they originally were. This isn\u2019t even mentioning the staggering number of characters this show introduces. There are like 10 new villains that arrived on the scene halfway through the show, plus all the Chronos assassins and executives, plus the guys who were in charge of those 10 or so new villains I just mentioned\u2026the list just keeps growing and growing, and almost none of them get any kind of proper characterization, let alone development. It\u2019s as if Naruto or One Piece were to condense themselves into 25 or so episodes, and cram their entire casts and plot into that timeframe. It\u2019s insane.\\n\\n\r\nAll that being said, the anime does have its good qualities. As I said before, the first part of the anime is very well done, and it constructs a reasonably compelling narrative while introducing a pretty solid cast of characters to drive it forward. The art and animation are also good, although the color palette was a little weird and off-putting at times. The soundtrack is fairly strong as well, and I am particularly fond of the opening theme.\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the overwhelming number of flaws prevent this anime from being anything more than way below-average at best. In truth, the last three-quarters or so of this anime are straight up terrible in terms of execution. Still, though\u2026I can only imagine how much more enjoyable this anime could\u2019ve been if they had just stuck to the format the first few episodes had established. It\u2019s a damn shame. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "At first I didn&rsquo;t like it, but it grew on me after a while. I didn&rsquo;t like it at first probably because it was a bit serious, and its first impression on me wasn&rsquo;t that good. The storyline for the first few episodes didn&rsquo;t grab me, and I found myself always distracted by something else. \r\nThe storyline was promising, but I felt like the creators tried to fit as much as they can in only 26 episodes. Only the last three episodes were dedicated to Eve&rsquo;s true nature, which was almost forgotten.\r\nCharacter design was average. The Numbers and the other villains who had the powerof the Tao looked impressive (Specially Leon), but Sven was just weird, Eve had a big head (although she was adorable when she became a bit human) and Rins tried to pull of some fan service but it didn&rsquo;t work too well for her. I have to say the characters were poorly managed &ndash; there were just too many of them and in the end, not everyone was able to get a good amount of screen time. I don&rsquo;t even know the names of most of the sweepers from the sweeper alliance. A lot of them were unnecessary too. Although I still find myself liking Train. He was so cool and mysterious at first but in the end he became so wacky and funny and just adorable. \\n\\n\r\nDrawing style was so &ndash; so. I felt like it was almost there, but still quite lacking. Train was well drawn, but there were times when the drawing style would change and his face would morph. Speaking of morph, I noticed that the colors were inconsistent, specially when it came to hair colors. Towards the end I noticed that Sven&rsquo;s hair was a darker green, and Eve&rsquo;s hair was a paler yellow, and Rins&rsquo; hair was also a lighter purple. The colors were just sub par. I would also like to note the use of CG, which complimented the animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was okay. At first I thought Train&rsquo;s voice didn&rsquo;t match him, because he looked too young and his voice was too low. When he became more cheerful and friendly, his voice changed and became more suited to his personality. I was also happy to find out that Number X&rsquo;s (Shaolee?) seiyu was the same seiyu for Kohsaka from Genshiken, Wolfram from Kyo Kara Maoh!, Junior from R.O.D the TV and Robert Haydn from Law of Ueki. I love all of those series and I thought the seiyu for all those characters did well too, so it was definitely a plus to have her be a seiyu for Black Cat as well, even if it&rsquo;s just a supporting role. \\n\\n\r\nI&rsquo;m a big fan of the BGM for this series. I thought the BMG complimented the scenes well, and if not, improved the feel of the scenes. I was a bit indifferent towards the opening and ending themes, specially the first ending theme &ndash; I just thought it didn&rsquo;t match the anime at all, but it grew on me. Same for the second ending theme which was a bit dull and boring, but in the end I got to appreciate its beauty. \\n\\n\r\nIt did reach my expectations &ndash; it lived up to the name of Gonzo after all. It was a good decision to watch it and I understand why it&rsquo;s so popular in the Philippines. I can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s great, specially since the ending under whelmed me (yet again), but it was a good watch for most of the time.",

            "content": "The purpose of this review is to express my disappointment as someone who read the manga first and enjoyed it a lot, and I will actually put my conclusion as an introduction so that at least some people will not summarily dismiss this (although I do not know how effective that will be; people tend to rate based on if the scores agree with them).\r\nNone of this is to say that the anime is not worth watching if you have not read the manga, or even if you have, everyone is different and you might wildly enjoy it. It has a genuine plot that hasa clear goal and approaches it with a fairly consistent pace; it is rather all the little details which detract from this anime for me. The manga's art is more enjoyable since it is not poorly animated, its plot is executed more grandiosely, which is the main difference besides art that bothers me, and the manga allows you to imagine how the characters act a little more, and while sometimes an anime exceeds my imagination, as I am not very creative, it did not in this instance.\\n\\n\r\nI think the easiest place to start is the art. If you have watched a lot of Gonzo, then you probably have found that although maybe not always superb, they have had a hand in such creations as Gankutsuou or Last Exile with superb animation that moves very naturally (except in the terrible mech scene), and even in less refined instances like Full Metal Panic! or Gantz is still quite acceptable typically. In this anime it moves very awkwardly and left me rendered uncomfortable the entire anime. It is not the worst art ever, and I am giving it a three not so much for the actual drawing style, which is probably around fairly typical, but for the emphatically terrible way in which movement occurs.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is stellar. In regard to music, I usually try to rate it this way: if it does not detract from the anime, then I am not upset (if it detracts I will rate it a 1 or 2 by default). In this case, it is certainly no Cowboy Bebop or anything, but it never terribly detracts, distracts, or annoys.\\n\\n\r\nI want to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that the plot changes they made were for the amount of time they had allotted to do with the amount of episodes, but I found almost every plot change to be for the worse, which is why I penalized the story so highly. It is much more exciting and constantly 'epic' in the manga. I will not spoil them here, but if you have read and not watched or vice versa, then you will easily notice them.",

            "content": "Main\r\nI almost never watched this show because I was told the show sucked....which I guess only goes to show that not matter what people say or how many people say it, it's really up to the individual and that person's preferences. Needless to say my review will probably be taken as a dissenting opinion from the majority who have given this show a medium to low score. Black Cat is not a bad show and it's not really a disappointing show either....only to those who selected this series with the expectation of finding the next Holy Grail of an anime, i.e., Cowboy Bebop or Trigun.\r\nIfyou decide to pick this series to watch, then judge it on it's own merit and you will enjoy it a lot better. There's a nice mixture of funny and sad moments [expect some characters being killed off], there is some dramatic tension and a decent climax. Again, to me this was not such a horrendous story and I don't see where the big disappointment is. So I guess it would be best to say that this is the type of show you are going to have to watch and then formulate your own opinions about it. \\n\\n\r\nArt Style\\n\r\nAt first I thought &ldquo;Gee, what sucky animation! ....Especially for something that came from Gonzo!!!!&rdquo; But then I thought it was unfair to &ldquo;expect things&rdquo; and not allow room for change or a different form of expression. So I guess I could say that the animation for this show was pretty standard during the non-combat scenes......and &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; during the battle scenes. By experimental I mean, that the movements aren't very stylish, fancy, fluid or even detailed for that matter, objects tend to move at a super fast rate and there's a lot of [over] usage of different blurring effects and overlays. Also during these battle scenes a lot of times you won't have any backgrounds just the characters duking it out with their own brand of super powers thru numerous repeated [non-looped] scenes and multi-angled shots. Nothing else really stands out animation-wise, there aren't any beautiful scenery or exotic locales, this show is pretty much character driven so expect most [if not all] scenes to involve these people with powers in various situations. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI can't remember there being much music in this show. My favourite song has to be the OP, not for any particular reason except for that I like the part where Saya spins at &frac12; speed in her star-printed yukata, and the sound of the singers voice at that part. The first ED song I don't remember....I just like all the cat-faced people running and jumping around, the second ED song was also very nice, but I didn't think it should have been part of this anime's soundtrack.....also again I did like the little filmstrip flashback with Saya at the very end. \\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nEventho I read some reviews on a couple of sites, I don't think the story was such a total mess. Yes! I DO think the ending was a little abrupt, it could have used a little cleaning up and with the series overall, a little tightening up here and there could have been done.....but it was still a fairly decent and entertaining story! But really I think just because this series started with that type of dramatic opening scenes with the shady characters jumping around on rooftops and a couple assassinations, people thought &ldquo;YES! Guns, assassins, gangsters...Gungrave, Bebop, Trigun!!!&rdquo; and then was put off by the shows apparent goofiness. The thing is the show was always goofy and was intended to be that way from the get-go. Now whether or not the manga was originally as goofy I don't know and honestly part of the reasons I used to not read mangas much was because I knew I would have issues with animes that didn't do a good job with the adaptation and I wouldn't be able to wholly enjoy the show. Black Cat I did enjoy because I watched it without trying to attach it to something else or try to compare it to anything else whether it be the original manga or other anime shows and it was a fun show.\\n\\n\r\nSo in other words, this was hardly a compelling drama or nail-bitingly suspenseful series it's just a superficially entertaining show where you'll laugh at the funny parts and be moved by the more touching parts, it's nothing you'll want to write a college thesis about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nYou can definitely expect lots and lots of characters! I don't particularly go for shows with an infinite array of characters because it's too easy to lose focus of the actual plot and get all engrossed with &ldquo;favourite&rdquo; characters! Besides seeing too many faces and hearing a lot of names, gives me headache. This show does try it's best to keep it all around the five or so central figures, so this isn't as bad....and Sven does try to keep things light and funny which I could appreciate.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWorth it or not?\\n\r\nI liked it, I thought it was a good show and they kept it light and funny, except for a few poignant scenes. I would recommend this show to people...but not without making sure they're going to be really objective about it, otherwise they just be wasting their time to wind up as another disappointed viewer.",

            "content": "Ka-boom! Ka-boom! Ka-boom!\r\nA plethora of evocative, vibrant fireworks erupt in the gloomy skies of a particularly somber city. In the streets of said city, two forces empathetically collide together and immediately disconnect again and again, like two pendulums swinging in different directions, as brilliant, multicolored sparks soar all over the place. The conflict is one between two fighters that appear to be engaged in a fierce duel to the death, the animosity for each other intoxicating. One fighter possesses the look of a weathered wanderer with his tattered black jacket in tow, and he holds a gun in his hand while the other fighter, donninga polished white jacket, grips a glowing sword, akin to a lightsaber. While slabs of concrete are torn to shreds, while entire houses are reduced to smithereens, the movements of these two alleyway brawlers are effortless, elegant, and expeditious, more a resemblance of Baryshnikov than Andre the Giant. As the showdown reaches its climax, the weapons of the two fighters, the gun and the lightsaber-like sword, are pressed against one another, the sparks frenziedly bouncing off them. The man in the white jacket bellows at his opponent, \u201cYour eyes! That woman! She\u2019s got you! You\u2019re under that witch\u2019s spell!\u201d A cutaway to a woman\u2019s body, horrifically pale and bloodied, occurs before he raises his sword in preparation for a lethal downward strike. We then witness the aftereffect of his attack; we see his opponent, the fighter in the black jacket, howling in pain, spiraling to the ground in defeat.\\n\\n\r\nThis, my friend, is the first thirty-five seconds of Black Cat.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one thing that this series can accomplish, it\u2019s the ability to hook you into its framework, to really galvanize the audience into discovering what it\u2019s all about. Black Cat\u2019s theme song, Yorico\u2019s \u201cDaia no Hana\u201d, does a fantastic job at this. This opening unveils a story centered on the black-coated wanderer (Train Heartnet) seeking a purpose in life, attempting to escape the psychological stronghold placed on him by the white-coated swordsman (Creed Diskenth) and the organization which once employed both of them (Chronos, the governmental entity comprised entirely of assassins for hire). In a strange twist of fate, Train encounters others that either desire to live freely like him or that want to encourage him in the right direction (Sven Vollfied, Saya Minatsuki, Eve, and Rinslet Walker). The remainder of the theme song is dedicated to presenting the obstacles these characters face as well as the friends (and enemies) they come across along the way. Musically speaking, \u201cDaia no Hana\u201d is a triumph, explosive at times and somber in other moments, a virtuoso of tonal shifts. Really, it\u2019s among the biggest highlights of Black Cat\u2019s soundtrack. Crafted by composer Taku Iwasaki (who would later create the OST for Gurren Lagann), the music in Black Cat is surprisingly sober, a relaxed and low-key combination of folk blues, classical, and piano compositions (The music that appears in the eye catches are particularly smooth). However, the bombasticness, the over-the-top energy, that Taku Iwasaki would later be acclaimed for, shines through in songs like \u201cAccettami\u201d and \u201cYajuu no Chi\u201d but especially \u201cKuroki Neko\u201d (Train\u2019s character theme), a memorably grandiose and overpowering orchestral track. In contrast to the mood Iwasaki already established, Black Cat\u2019s first ED, PUPPEYPET\u2019s \u201cNamidaboshi\u201d, is silly, immature, and even infantile at times. However, the second ED (Matsuda Ryouji\u2019s \u00a0\u201cKutsuzure\u201d) is much more fitting; it possesses a soulful, melancholic feel to it.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the soundtrack applies a sleek yet vibrant atmosphere to the show, Black Cat\u2019s amazing aesthetics provide a stylishly visceral element. Produced by Studio Gonzo, this show\u2019s character designs are mercurial in terms of quality (It\u2019s strikingly obvious when it\u2019s great and when it\u2019s not), and the animation overall is fairly standard for the most part. Sure, the show\u2019s CGI is simply horrifying (a Gonzo trademark) but Black Cat compensates with its beautiful back lighting and enthusiastic color palette. However, it\u2019s the streaks of artistic brilliance that causes Black Cat to visually stand out the most. In one scene, a particularly opulent character showcases an outfit of Unmoving Plaid, a creative move reminiscent of Gankutsuou, an earlier Gonzo project. More than anything else, Black Cat\u2019s fight scenes are where it unleashes the fullest extent of its visual excellence; they\u2019re almost always intense and jaw-droppingly stylish, the embodiment of cinematic creativity. The fights that personally stand out are the ones late in the series, like Eve vs Leon, the final showdown between Train and Creed, and especially Sephiria vs Creed (In that particular fight, there\u2019s an amazing shift between during the battle and after; the showdown\u2019s result is portrayed in black and white while the fight itself is overflowing in color). To be honest, it was Black Cat that first inspired me to value the art of cinematography.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWow. This sucker sure is heavy,\u201d - Saya Minatsuki (episode 5)\\n\\n\r\nYou can possess the world\u2019s most hardboiled soundtrack and dark-colored designs but if the writers of a TV show can\u2019t craft a consistently exciting drama, then everything falls apart. Just look at Deadman Wonderland. Black Cat, on the other hand, is a master of mood execution. What I mean is that when drama is needed, it is established and executed at a high level of quality, like episode ten\u2019s chase scene. When Black Cat desires to frighten the audience, it elevates its Horror Factor to an unprecedented level, like Train\u2019s nightmare in episode 14. Admittedly, this show falters when it involves emotional appeal but Black Cat compensates with scenes like Beluga (a Chronos operative) and his roaring rampage of revenge in episode 15; it\u2019s among Black Cat\u2019s most poignant moments. Sadly, the show\u2019s forays into comedy are even worse. Early on, Black Cat maintained a generally unremarkable yet balanced sense of humor; during serious scenes, the jokes were never repetitive nor underwhelming. Later on, Black Cat\u2019s comedic success devolves into oversaturated mediocrity with a knack for tiresome, unoriginal gags (Remember The Looney Tunes Rule: when you\u2019re in the air, don\u2019t look down).\\n\\n\r\nThere are quite a few areas in which Black Cat hardly qualifies as perfect but its characterization is where the show is perhaps the most deficient in. Black Cat performs commendably at its usage of recurring side characters, allotting them sufficient screen time, depth, and individuality, like Petra Ghoul, Annette, and Tanya. However, Black Cat\u2019s overall characterization leaves much to be desired. With notable exceptions to three fantastic characters (who I\u2019ll mention later), the members of Black Cat\u2019s cast can be filed into five categories: consistently good-but-not-great (Train and Eve), good-but-not-great characters with shrinking importance (Rinslet, Leon, Sephiria, and Woodney), fairly worthwhile characters with decent amount of depth (Tearju, Dr. Kanzaki, Igor Planter, Tim, and Gyanza), terrible (Mason, Kyoko, 85% of Chronos, and the entire Sweepers Alliance)....and River Zastory.\\n\\n\r\n(I won\u2019t mince words here: River Zastory is unarguably one of the most pointless characters in all of anime. There is not one thing that he contributed to the show that someone else didn\u2019t already contribute at a higher level of quality. Train, Creed, Eve, and Sephiria are stronger. Sven, Woodney, and almost everyone else have a greater sense of humor. Even the show\u2019s pet mascot is more important than him. River Zastory has no chemistry or bond with anyone. He has zero character development and depth. He doesn\u2019t even have personality traits. If there\u2019s one word that can be used to describe River Zastory, it\u2019s \u201cexpendable\u201d).\\n\\n\r\nWhile River Zastory (and the show\u2019s characters in general) represent Black Cat at its worst, there are three members of the cast that allot a sense of respectability to the group as a whole, and one of them as Saya Minatsuki (voiced by Caitlin Glass). She\u2019s an experienced bounty hunter (or \u201cSweeper\u201d as this is what they are known by in Black Cat) whose relaxed nature belies her frightening accuracy with \u00a0her handgun. A free spirit more than anything else, Saya influences Train to embrace his individuality and to not be concerned with how others (namely Creed) wish for him to live. The show was only graced with her presence for six episodes but Saya became a fan favorite due to her witty observations, her likability, her competitive spirit, and her silliness.\\n\\n\r\nSven Vollfied is another of Black Cat\u2019s finest characters, and my personal favorite of the bunch. A cross between Trigun\u2019s Nicholas D. Wolfwood (his sarcasm and snarky brilliance) and Cowboy Bebop\u2019s Jet Black (his fashion sense and traditionalist values), Sven is a chain-smoking ex-cop with unbelievable bad luck, chain to an occupation he once referred to as being a glorified nomad. Brandon Potter, in his role as Sven, delivers a raspy, worn-out baritone that\u2019s perfect for Black Cat\u2019s green-haired sweeper; it\u2019s as if Potter was born for this role. In a show where characters are defined almost entirely by how physically imposing they are, Sven gets by with his gadget-filled suitcase, his superb quick thinking, and a nifty ability to glimpse into the future. Ultimately, Sven Vollfied is a paragon of natural charm, the embodiment of smooth, and a richly developed character\u2026. but he doesn\u2019t come close to Creed Diskenth.\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, Creed (brought to life by a scenery-chewing, show-stopping performance from Chris Patton) doesn\u2019t look like much, just another maniacal villain aiming to take over the world. Yet, there\u2019s more to Creed than that. Throughout the course of Black Cat, we witness a broken human being mistreated and dismissed by those above him. We witness a man who seeks to change the world for the better but devolves into one of the monsters he despised in the first place (Creed\u2019s ambition is pure yet his intentions are not). We witness a man, who wasn\u2019t too mentally stable to begin with, spiral further and further into the very depths of madness. We witness a charismatic leader establish a tight-knit circle of followers and we observe his utter disdain for virtually all of them. We witness a man\u2019s overly obsessive pursuit for the approval and praise of another, and we observe the man\u2019s realization of his pursuit being a pointless one. Finally, we witness a man\u2019s journey towards redemption; it is a rather hasty journey but a journey nonetheless. Compared to Black Cat\u2019s other characters, Creed Diskenth is a diamond in the rough, the proverbial needle in the haystack, a ray of light in a cave of darkness.\\n\\n\r\nThough there is much to criticize Black Cat\u2019s cast for, what I appreciate most about them is the show\u2019s ability to frame the characters in representing the various ideologies that are established in the plot. Zagine (Train\u2019s mentor) and Creed passionately advocate for Social Darwinism while Sephiria pontificates on the societal effects of a corrupt government. Eve introduces an unconventional outlook on pets (that these animals are forced into a new and unfamiliar environment against their will) while the Sweepers Alliance criticizes the government\u2019s nonchalant treatment of them. All of this (and more) are woven together to collectively enhance the central storyline of revenge and redemption.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, it was this speciality, the gift for presenting an array of ideologies, that gradually dissolved into nothingness as Black Cat\u2019s runtime increased, along with many of the series\u2019 other noteworthy attributes. While the show was never one without flaws, Black Cat, at its absolute apex (from episodes 1 to 12, specifically episodes 8 to 12), achieved in magnifying its greatest features and minimizing its shortcomings to the best of its abilities. It is immediately after Train\u2019s second big showdown against Creed in episode 12 (they would have one more before the series concluded) that Black Cat devolves from a gritty, multilayered action-noir epic into a half-hearted, by-the-numbers beat-em-up comedy. After episode 12, Black Cat possesses a few glimmers of brilliance, like the transcendent episode 14 and Charden\u2019s character arc, but ultimately it\u2019s not enough to overcome the phenomenal deprivation of everything that made this show special.\\n\\n\r\nTo deploy a term invented by MyAnimeList user CodeBlazeFate, Black Cat is a poster boy victim of \u201cSecond Half Syndrome\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nJust when you think that Black Cat\u2019s latter portion can\u2019t become more of a disgrace (after the pointless filler episode, the useless Tao monsters, River Zastory\u2019s entire existence, and episode 20\u2019s uber-convenient deus ex machina), the Eden Project Arc commences. This is what Black Cat\u2019s last four episodes are dedicated to; this is something that the show has been anticipating since the very beginning but you can\u2019t resist wishing it were better executed. The Eden Project Arc is centered on Eve\u2019s desires to be understood and to find somewhere she belongs yet she\u2019s utilized as a plot device, a placeholder if you will, instead of a character with real emotions. The Eden Project Arc bombards its runtime with an overflow of unnecessary archetypes instead of simply selecting a handful of important characters and providing them with their own individual reasons for destroying the evil operation. The Eden Project Arc possesses an abundance of Biblical references (mostly involving the Book of Genesis) but it devotes its runtime to \u201cmaking the weapon of destruction look really cool and do really cool things\u201d instead of allotting substance and nuance to the references. The utterly irredeemable cop-out near the end serves as the embodiment of everything the Eden Project Arc did wrong, the cherry on top of a perfect disaster.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Cat, in a medium where action shows are a dime a dozen, has become a forgotten relic of the mid-2000s, ruthlessly criticized on the rare occasion in which its name pops up. The majority of those that viewed Black Cat immediately dismissed it as a Cowboy Bebop knockoff (kind of true) instead of appreciating it for what it is. As a result, Black Cat is wandering aimlessly outside of MAL\u2019s Top 1000, its fans few and far between. As one of the only advocates for this hidden gem, I\u2019d argue that Black Cat, despite its shortcomings, is wildly underrated; it\u2019s much more creative, intense, and complex than people give it credit for. Black Cat exists as an interesting revision of the Cowboy Bebop formula, as a brilliant representation of Gonzo at the height of its aesthetic glory, and as one of the greatest shonen epics you\u2019ll ever encounter. With that, I encourage you to not allow the opinions of others to prevent you from giving this show a chance. Black Cat is not a kitty that will bite you.",

It gives you the pleasure of a good laugh at its gags, moderately suspenseful as the story unfolds and with certain scenes, maybe a tear or two may shed. I found this thoroughly enjoyable. \r\nThe story revolves around Train Heartnet, a.k.a Black Cat. Chained down as a professional assassin, Black Cat is expected to adhere strictly to the orders of Chronos Organization. Betrayal to the groups ideals is unforgivable and leads only to death. Train lived his life, killing professionally without a second thought until he meetsa 'Sweeper', Minatsuki Saya. \\n\r\nBeing completely free and independent Saya believes strongly in choice, whether in taking charge of ones own life or choosing to take others'. With this contradiction, Train begins to doubt his methods and slowly yearns to search for more than cold murder. \\n\r\nBlack Cat portrays different meanings of justice, honour and life as Train escapes from the clutches of indomitable Chronos and obsessive ex-partner to a &quot;mercenarious&quot; life of a sweeper.",

I noticed only the people who rated this about and 8 or up knows why. When its completely obvious why he changed. Also the anime has a plot, then another two plots in one. They did it all how i wanted them too. Maybe they did rush it a little at the end, but it still made sense. The animation was really good. I loved all the characters. To me they are the best part. I really dont remember any charactersthat didnt contribute anything. Some of the chronos numbers really didnt but thats all. EVERYone did something. The reason this anime sparked in my book, was that it was Shounen yet it wasnt anything like Bleach and all those other ones, that are pure fighting. The characters sparked a lot, and a huge change from the manga in art. Really it irritates me how under rated this anime is. There wasnt much wrong with it. \\n\r\nI would suggest watching it all over the other bounty animes. Like Cowboy Bebop, truelly i dont know why that one is that great.",

Ever since I was little, and much like every other Arabian kid, a TV channel by the name of \u201cSpacetoon\u201d was what made all of those kids' childhood, \u201cThe channel of future youngsters\u201d was the slogan, and it was no stretch. Among the many classics they used to air was \u201cBlack Cat\u201d, with its nostalgic opening theme song and key characters, you couldn't call yourself afan if you haven't at least rewatched the series more than twice and recall the chronological order of events by heart. But over the +10 years that have passed since those simpler days, the plot, in general, had already faded from my memory and it was time to revisit the nostalgic classic once again and see if it holds up to today's standards.\\n\\n\r\n- Story (7.0/10):\\n\r\nHeavily reliant on mythology and religious references, a story set on a post-war setting where conflict is still being fueled for what the losses that have already been suffered from weren't enough. A secret organization by the name of Chronos reigns from the shadows in pursuit of true peace by the means of blood and assassination, standing on the lead of its ranks numbered agents that go from 1 and increasing reaching number 13, that would be Train Heartnet, one of the protagonists of the series that seeks freedom and takes from Chronos a false escape from his intent of murder, little did he know soon enough that he will be freed with the help of Saya Minatsuki, a sweeper that helped him see the world in a different perspective.\\n\r\nUnlike the real-world intuitive definition of a sweeper, sweepers here are people, much like freelance bounty hunters that arrest criminals alive in a manner that contradicts the methods of Chronos but also not completely oppose them. That was pretty much the set up for the story without spoiling any vital information.\\n\r\nOne thing they nailed here is the balance of comedy and action that very few shows manage to achieve (ex; One Piece), a running theme here seems to be cat humor, so, for cat lovers out there, you're in for some minimalistic chibi cat figures, in the other hand comes the badassness, everything from the cool poses, epic entrances, badass black cloaks and guns, enough to draw in your interest in fights. However, it seems they went the wrong turn with that, most fights are just a mess of complicated poorly juxtaposed frames that barely make sense, it makes it hard to keep up and follow what's going on, for the most part, add to that the frequently low FPS moments that make my potato computer running Minecraft shaders look like a champ.\\n\r\nOne misconception in anime is that if a show is fast-paced and straightforward, it creates opportunities for better story execution and character development, that is if done right. Black Cat suffers from consistency in pacing, it's fast yes, but faster than the flow of the story. The main quest is about revenge and redemption after all, but it doesn't leave much space for side quests to be fleshed out, and thus, every other side episode so to speak, feels like watching a horrible filler from the deepest pits of Naruto Shippuden's filler hell.\\n\\n\r\n- Art (7.5/10):\\n\r\nPersonally, I adore the art style, I would describe it as that of a vampire-ish dark vibe, heavy on sharp edges but not quite as sharp as Code Geass's character's chins, God lord, those are deadly (Not to say that Code Geass is a horrible show, like seriously, if you haven't watched yet, what are you waiting for?). Having the show portrays a light-hearted comedy, it doesn't fall short on it being dark, remember, this show is about assassins, bounty hunters, a world of conflict, and if the title \u201cBlack Cat\u201d wasn't enough to emphasize, the art style surely does. The color palette is dark, but unlike other shows where it gets so dark that it's difficult to see anything on the screen, Black Cat knew when to stop. Those mix of aspects created a certain atmosphere to the story that you don't get from any other shows, I would say, it's the closest you can get to the Resident Evil 4 video game (you know what greatness you're getting now).\\n\\n\r\n- Sound (8.5/10):\\n\r\nWhilst typing this, I'm still on an intense debate in my head whether I find the Arabic version of the opening theme song or the original Japanese version the better one, nostalgia is a biased factor here, but that doesn't make the other any less good. I mean, it's \u201cI can listen to this all day\u201d material going as far as \u201cplay this in my funeral\u201d type of song. What I love about it is how soft and light it starts out and how quietly strong it gets near the end, makes for a perfect preparation to get you in the mood for some Train wrecking (that was intended). I'm glad they kept the same opening theme song throughout the whole run, with updated visuals midway the show, and two great ending theme songs to kind of cal you down at the end of each episode.\\n\r\nI listened to both the English dubbed and subbed versions before choosing which one to go by, spoiler alert, it was the English sub, however, that didn't make the dubbed version look any less immersive, the main voices were spectacular, but I still wanted to go by the original version to kind of experience it the way it was made. So, for those who are deciding which one to watch, I recommend both, you might as well watch both alternating between one and other any time you see fit.\\n\\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\\n\r\nCharacters make half the show they say, and they couldn't be wrong, I mean look at Taboo Tatoo, that's what you get when you populate a story with potential with shallow characters, absolutely terrible. Black Cat, on the other hand, did a decent job keeping things as neutral as they are.\\n\r\nLiterally, every single character had a great development throughout, the initial Train is not the Train five episodes later, and the same Train is not the Train of later either, and that doesn't go for only main characters.\\n\r\nThere wasn't any annoying pitiful figure that made you snap out every time they spoke, I liked every single one of them and even had my favorites as well. Buuuuuuut, an issue with lacking backstories and plausible plot holes did leave their marks, some characters were indeed fleshed out but only compared to the neglected individuals, I'm not asking for a focusing ark for every single fraction of dirt. A character needs motive and purpose, it needs to follow an ideology or else, it falls under the nouveau-rich category from the background crowd.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.0/10):\\n\r\nNostalgia is a drug, I remember watching this show like it was like no other, it's safe to say that it was way below my expectations. Did it age well, pr-oba--b-l-y???! I'd feel guilty of admitting it, there were strong moments, but there were also weak moments that didn't live up to what I remember.\\n\r\nI still laughed at the same exact old jokes (it seems parts of me never got old), I still liked the characters and found the story mildly interesting.\\n\r\nAt the start of my rewatch, I went all out, a barking nostalgia dog claiming that I can binge it in no time, but the effect of the drug wore off near the two-digit episodes, and the rest was history. A humble number of episodes were just plain boring, \u201cI fell asleep while watching X\u201d material. Not my proudest come back in any respect, it seems I learned to disregard nostalgia the hard way, but the actual good parts were just enough refreshment to get me all strong and recovered.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall (7.6/10):\\n\r\nAs far as shounen shows, Black Cat had its unique take on the genre, nothing revolutionary, but it certainly is way different than your modern shounen shows (My Hero Academia, Black Clover...). If you want to revisit what old shows used to be like, Black Cat does a good job retaining that fashion and atmosphere, the feelings that you're sent back to 2005 for 20 minutes, that's one approach to time travel. Now, for you people who have nostalgic memories to the show, please proceed with caution, the show that blew your mind back then may never feel the same, so tone down the expectations, but don't make my words scare you, our little nostalgic friend here still has its old special charm.",

            "content": "Well, first of all, thank you for reading my review. Let's get on with it, shall we?\r\nAnimation:\r\nThe animation is okay, but it gets better during the action scenes. But during a few battle scenes, there aren't backgrounds, it just shows the characters brawling it out. \r\nMusic:\r\nThe music is quite good, it usually fits the mood and all. The opening is pretty awesome if you ask me, it's one of my favorites. The first ending theme is quite funny, and I always find myself thinking \"This is pretty funny\" and start laughing just a little bit. The second ending took me a little while to getused to, but the scene with all the characters is quite well done, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nI find the story quite interesting. I really like both Sven's and Train's side of the story, and it's also enjoyable to find more on their backgrounds. I was surprised that some of the characters did die, I really thought that it would be a fighting series without actual deaths. Of course, the deaths aren't a bad thing. I found the main characters appealing and a great fit for a Shonen anime. The only thing I don't like is that absolutely none of the episodes are the same as the manga, but it gets the basic story through.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Judgement:\\n\r\nPros- Fine Music, Great Characters, Keeps a similar story\\n\r\nCons- Differs from the manga, Animation needs improvement",

The series seem to really like to jump around with plots, which does keep the series \"fast paced\", but it also makes the storyline seem annoyingly choppy. The series was intended for 50 episodes, but was cut short at 23, which is really odd considering how series are usually 26. There is a noticeable jump in the series where its obvious that there could of dragged on.\r\nMusic-8/10-The OP is pretty good, the happyish ED really gives away the factthat the series is always gonna have happy ending. The soundtrack is very similar to Getbackers, and is almost as good.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-6/10-The fight scenes are okay, but sometimes everything seems like the artist was high, for the colors of the scenes would just be so random. The ART is average, with some average to below average animation, those lame freeze frames.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-7/10-Its like a lot getbackers with the fact that the &quot;main&quot; characters are two guys who have different special techniques or abilities, that are trying to stop crime, while trying to earn money.

There is character development, but it usually seems to rushed or calculated.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Value-7/10-This series is pretty cool, but doesn't seem extremely special or great.

You will still enjoy the twist and turns of how the plot was played. But I am totally disappointed on how \"fast\" the stories were. It's like it was rushed. It could have been better if they would have at least 40 or more episodes just to stretch out the details. It's like I just watched a long movie, not a series. \r\nThe art and sounds are good enough.\r\nWhen it comes to character, since the story, in my opinion,was rushed, they weren't able to give the characters depth on why they were like that. \\n\r\nEverything was compressed in an episode and all willing to do everything after meeting them once. The shifting of black cat's character was not smoothly shifted as well. It's like he turned 180 degrees after just a few conversation.\\n\\n\r\nBut still, like what I said earlier, nonetheless, this is still a good anime to enjoy. I would still recommended it, esp to those doesn't like much talks but more on to action. You will not regret watching this.",

            "content": "Black Cat! What an awesome synopsis with a great story! These were my first thoughts on the series. In the beginning, I was very impressed. The first few episodes were great, entertaining. Unfortunately, it all just fell apart into a giant mush of boring side stories, awful character morals, and poorly designed villains. \r\n             I like to start my reviews off with the good aspects of a series, so let's go over a few. The opening song wasn't too bad.The animation was average. I did find myself enjoying a few of the characters. Sven had excellent voice acting. Saiya and Kyouko  were enjoyable characters. There was so much potential!\\n\\n\r\n            Let's skip the point... I just, wow. I was enjoying Black Cat a lot, but it was just written so poorly. It was about cool assassins and bounty hunters, then they became morally illogical, neighborhood watch style of characters.\\n\r\n                \"We have the power to kill this terrible murderous rapist with super powers, but let's turn him over to the police so he can break of jail for the 6th time.\"\\n\r\n            Of course, this is just an example, not a spoiler, but you understand how frustrating it became. Not only that, but the story just kept flipping to awful side stories and introducing useless characters with no relevance whatsoever. Most of the villains had ridiculous logic, or lack thereof. Not to mention, this series actually has 24 episodes. Mal probably didn't include the 24th episode because it was downright terrible. You could hardly tell what was going on at all. \\n\\n\r\n            All and all, I will not be watching this series again, and I'm not even that proud to have finished it. It's too violent for kids, too illogical for adults.. it's just a flop. If you enjoy far-fetched, wild adventures, with ministories that don't add to the main story, you might enjoy Black Cat, but it definitely wasn't for me.\\n\\n\r\n3/10 Sweepers. Hopefully enough to sweep it under the rug :') !",

            "content": "Ok, so before I have told you that I\u2019m not crazy about girls and guns genre, but I guess this could be considered guys and guns. Now in this, it\u2019s a bit different except the concept was the same, guy gets into a organization as pretty much a hired gun and goes around assassinating who the organization doesn\u2019t like. The thing I like about this show is that it doesn\u2019t start there, and most of that is actually back story. This is about him getting out of the group and learning what he himself wanted. The character that actually helps him figure this out is\u2018new\u2019 code was Saya but it really annoyed me they killed her off so quickly. \\n\\n\r\nNow I do wonder a lot about why Saya is a big part of Train\u2019s life and why he goes out for revenge. He only knows her for about 2 or three days so why does he go crazy when she dies? Is it because she is the only person he cared about that died in front of him? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case because they show he has seen others he cares about dieing before then so why? Give us a bit more to work on with her please. I liked the show but I hate that they add Saya only to kill her off in the first 2 to 3 episodes. It\u2019s just not fair to both Train and the watcher. Once I got into her character, then I\u2019m hurt by how she is no longer there. Though there flash backs, we don\u2019t see much of how she affects Train much. It somewhat makes me feel that the first five episodes were wasted on the so called relationship between Train and Saya that had no real reason for being because it wasn\u2019t much of a relationship. \\n\\n\r\nThe fighting was rather interesting though sometimes it bothered me that we only got flashes of the fight and not a whole fight. It did get better after a while though. I am also don\u2019t really like the sudden change in Train\u2019s character that seems to mess with me. He all of a sudden is so childish in front of strangers. It\u2019s a complete turn around from how he was in the first few episode without any space in between for growth. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the animation feels much like an opening to a James Bond opening though it has a bit of the same flare as a new-vole in the beginning. And then it cuts that and goes into comic fest with jokes and funny site gags. It has a nice way of taking you into the story line for the drama, then hitting you over the head with a bat continually until it again goes back into Drama mode. But every battle works well with the next, someone studied well when it came to camera angles. Gonzo isn\u2019t known for great animation but this one is pretty nicely done.\\n\\n\r\nThe music has many different feels for each scene from the hunting chant whenever Greed (aka Seductive obsessed freak!) to the playful sounds of walking down the street that you normally get for comical affect. Most of them work well with the characters but once in a while\u2026 we get something that sounds rather bad or not fitting the area.\\n",

            "content": "WARRING - Can have a little spoiling\r\n--14 Episodes Watched--\r\nBlackCat or 'kuroneko' in romaji is a great anime with a lot of action and funny moments. Train Heartnet, codename BrakoKato, is a boy around 20 years old, whose family were killed by his after-teacher. When his teacher murdered, he became an assassin whose bullets were faster than his mind. In the short begin of the story, he met a girl called Saya, from who his transformation came to effect. He resigned  in assassination and became sweeper on his own will. \r\nBlackCat is anime mostly based on action. There's a lot of cool-posing BlackCat situations, anda lot of fights, evasions, fun and indeed a lot of ... really big individualities: from a little childish and shy Train, to a very obsession Creed ... in midsts there's one head-aired person, journalist with passion and 'ohime-sama' who bare bio-weapon's burden. However ... some parts of characters looks like copied from other animes. For example Eve, bio-girl, looks almost identically like Yami-chan from ToLoveRu anime series. Kyouko looks like Kyoko from ToLoveRu too ... so lame in my opinion but from the other side - those 'copies' are copies of the best chars, so I can forgive this little 'defect'.\\n\\n\r\nMusic ... it is the best thing at this anime. I love music during battles, during some funny moments ... and thing about opening and ending ... just love it. When protagonists are fighting there's a lot of good tunes, when they're doing funny thing there's good music for it ... and when there's no music ... that's good moment to be so too.\\n\\n\r\nSummary ... I enjoyed this anime a lot and hope it will continue a little bit more (14 episodes watched). Some moments of this anime are sad, some are happy but always there's not a 'boring time'. This anime is for peoples who like action, some dramatical scenes (mostly there's a one significant), a lot of darkness, insanity and add-ons of some funny scenes ;). I really recommend this anime for all those who think that mystery will work with fun.\\n\\n\r\nGreetings 9/10 from me.\\n\\n\r\n27/09/09\\n\r\nI've just finished watching this anime, and I can say, that it wasn't as good as I thought for the first time when I saw it. I did not change my mind about characters, sounds ... but I lower the grade of story, art and enjoyment as occurs. Why? There's no any logical sense between two close episodes. In the one episode train is doing something and that thing is not continuing in the next episode - you don't know what exactly happened!! About art: so ... further episodes, maybe after 15, have some charges at the background like \"colorful lines\" - it really annoys. And about enjoyment - heh - I think that I shouldn't tell that when the art and the story sucks sometimes, enjoyment is lower. \\n\\n\r\nSo in summary: After all, 'KuroNeko' degraded by me to 7 points of max 10.",

It's like a totally different anime after that. The producer might have hit his head or something. The beginning was very dark and cool, the main character, Train, was brilliant. A cold-blooded assassin who was starting to get a softer side, because of a girl he met. He was so serious compared to the other crazy characters. Even if I dislike this kind of psycho acting in an anime, I thought the jokes were very funny. Allthese were a sign of an extremely good anime. Bad impression. It gets so stupid and Train's character is RUINED. The mysterious, cool and serious guy is starting to act like a retard. They want to show us that he totally changed, but they could have done that in a more decent way. I'm so disappointed right now. And not because it's a retarded anime. I saw many like that. But the beginning was too brilliant for all to turn out like this. It's really a shame...\\n\\n\r\nedit after finishing it: I still have the same opinion, but I must say, the last few episodes were kinda good, and saved the whole anime. They stop acting like retards, the jokes are funny again. So I try to think of the middle part as an accident.  The story had a great potential, but oh well, it was still nice...",

But after that I absolutely couldn't watch any more, and now I have to hate this anime.

            "content": "DO you know Black Cat? OH im not talking to just a simple cute/cool looking cat`s out there.\r\nWhom I was talking about is Mr.#13/Black Cat/Train Heartnet.\r\nStory :\r\nBlack Cat is about a former assassin, Train, and a former investigator, Sven. While Train was an assassin, he was known as Black Cat. He used to work for an organization known as Chronos. Chronos controls the world and maintains the peace. It has 13 of its own assassins. Train was the 13th. Train and Sven are now bounty hunters, known as Sweepers. Train bears the number 13, in roman numerals, on his left chest and on his gun.Sven wears an eye patch over his right eye. They make their living going from place to place and catching bounties. Another former member of Chronos, Creed, plots to destroy Chronos. Creed wants to make a new world. Creed creates an organization known as The Messengers of The Stars, and gather other people who have gained unique powers through a special potion. And the ending, good god both the ending in the Anime and Manga were anticlimatic.\\n\\n\r\n***So I read all of the manga and only watched some of the anime, and I must say after reading the full story from the manga everything was medicore. I always wondered how you can make a genuinely good fight scene in a shonen series with guns, and the answer is not very well. Sure in Seinen Anime's guns shoot and kill people, but in Black Cat that never happens. The plot almost never develops it has always been a one track goal main character Train Heartnet is a sweeper and must find Creed to defeat him. Heck even the character development seemed rushed at some points, and man do I hate the scenes when Train goes into immature child mode, theres a right and wrong way to do it, and everything is wrong about him.***\\n\\n\r\nCharacters :\\n\r\nTrain Heartnet: Train is the main protagonist aka Himaru Kenshin except he uses a gun, besides that everything  and I mean everything about him is an exact clone copy. His old girlfriend dies, so he swears to never use his weapon to kill again. Now Himaru Kenshin was able to pull this off, besides his immaturity scenes, because he had a strict moral code. Train however just seems to be goofing off every second he can get, it's like he almost never takes his enemies seriously if their not Creed. And I also never understand how his enemies never attack him when he is reloading his gun, I mean come on, really.\\n\\n\r\nSaya Minatsuki : is an accomplished sweeper and close friend of Train. Her involvement with him leads to his more human outlook on life and his departure from Chronos. She is killed by Creed, who believes that Train's personality change is a curse due to her. Before dying, she tells Train to \"forget about her\", which causes him to struggle while deciding to get revenge on Creed or not. Her \"spirit\" lives on, often guiding Train and his friends and giving them strength. In the final scene of the anime, Train is seen walking past Saya's spirit.\\n\\n\r\nSven Vollfied : Sven now I knew was a good character from the start, it wasn't just his awesome suit and hat that he always wore, but it was his diligent all round gentleman personality. With Train literally a loose cannon running wild with his antics around town you need a more mature, more sophisticated type of person to keep him in check, and Sven is that man. He almost never had any action scenes because his main role was more of a support partner for Sven which is a good thing. However he has a briefcase gun so I don't care, that automatically beats Train in everything.\\n\\n\r\nEve : Every story needs a loli side kick if the main character is a young dude, and Eve is that girl, or maybe a better way to put it, biochemical weapon. She is one of those \"damn I don't have any emotions and can't act like a girl my age\" kind of girls and you get to watch her character development evolve throughout the course of the story, which is more then could be said for Train and Sven. Whats special about her is that she can turn her body into a living weapon, angel wings to fly? sure, molecular knifes to cut through steel? how about full body diamond defense? shes a pretty hax character.\\n\\n\r\nCreed Diskenth : Wow this guy couldnt be anymore like Sephiroth even if he tried, except minus the mama's boy complex. He likes wearing long black overall's, long silver hair, killed Trains girlfriend because he was jealous, and torments Train every waking moment of his life. He is also a closet homesexual because he has an unearthly lust after Train good god. It's like he wakes up every morning thinking \"I wonder what Train is doing right now? proberbly just getting out of bed just like me hehe\" Seriously this villian has no character developemnt and is flat our boring.\\n\\n\r\nManga art/Quality :\\n\r\nThe manga art/quality was okey I thought, nothing too special and nothing too bad, so it suprised me when the anime had at most, an above average quality of animation. It suprised me that they were doing quite well animating scenes at night time, using alot of random thunder and lightening for effect. The animation had a very crisp yet bold look to it that made the whole image of the show quite sharp. If it had the same animation quality as, oh lets say trigun, it would fail badly, even though their both gun slinging animes. The main reason being Trigun's desert setting matches quite well to the old classic animation style. Black Cat had to go about this in a more modern approach.\\n\\n\r\nClosing : \\n\r\n*** So I always saw the Black Cat manga up and about and it seemed that quite a few number of people had read and watched it. Seeing as how I thought \"heck I should have a go myself\" I felt very unsatisfied with the whole story, it all seemed way too predictable. Everything was way too generic, I mean I thought the story would of been a whole lot better if they focused primarily on the Chronos Organisation. But no, they had to focus on Creeds unhealthy obsession on Train and the countdown until the fatal finale. Heck even the endings of both the anime and manga left a very disatisfied feeling in my mouth, it was way to rushed and you just knew \"yeah thats pretty much how Train's gonna beat Creed\" Been there, done that is all I can say about Black Cat.***",

            "content": "Black Cat is a typical anime whereby the protagonist is usually someone who starts off being part of an organization, is the best at what he is or does and usually is a loner partly because childhood experiences helped to shape the nature of his character and what drives his goals and ambitions. The anime comprises of twenty three (23) episodes and it was not particularly a striking anime. In the opening episode, the anime displayed lots of promise and potential but as the series progressed, it started to fall apart based on storyline, plot and the development of the characters in the series. \r\nSTORY7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story focuses on the life of Train Hartnett, a former assassin of Chronos and the manner in which he transforms from a cold blooded assassin into someone living with a purpose. The story was not bad, just needed a few loose ends clearly up sometimes and some characters needed a bit more depth in them especially some of the supporting characters. Characters were thrown in and out of the story and there was no one with whom one can truly identify with. Also, the quick progression of the story saw characters changing sides from one episode to the next. Nevertheless, it made for some entertaining watching.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nART 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and setting reflected the mood of the anime since most of the action took place at night. This was due in part possibly to the name of the anime so the animation reflected this. The characters were well drawn and Train features did contain cat-like features.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music was excellent. The opening song was mellow yet spirited and the ending song was cute. The musical numbers in the anime were reflective of the mood at any one particular moment in time and even Saya\u2019s song was melodic and peaceful.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters had some unique qualities and the way they were drawn as well as their attire also reflected such. Train\u2019s character went through changes in the anime but there was no other significant development with regard to the other characters in the series.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEven though there were a few inconsistencies in the story at times, I did enjoy the series since the characters, although not anything especially special, were quite entertaining and there were times when it there was some suspense as to what was going to take place next so it was because of this that I found it quite okay.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 7/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe anime had potential but it was too rushed. The story, although interesting and engaging at times was not developed to a point where there could be justifications for some of the actions of some characters that took place in the anime itself. Otherwise, this series was pretty okay but you need not watch till the last episode although if you do watch, you\u2019ll understand why it was not necessary. \\n",

            "content": "Black Cat has everything a good anime has to offer:\r\nAngst fueled stylish haired gun waving smart ass, a lifeless lady of massive destruction, assassins, goofy support character, an insane villain and a few happy go lucky ladies. \r\nDespite the line up it doesn't quite come together right. I liked the premise of the story, a man fighting his dark past is something that is released in Japan about as often as a new Rihanna song in the pop industry but hey I find that a unoriginal story is not a death sentence and can be made into something truly unique with character development & plottwists.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Cat started out great with action and humor and had Trains fancy gun skills to boot, it felt like it was going to become a great anime. Then episode 8 happens, the anime takes a turn for the worse and feels like I am watching all filler which I was quite curious about due to Black Cat only having one season. Once the anime finally stops showing the viewer how to capture Reptar and helping the next Hercule out of the mess he had created, it picks up from where it left of and tries to make up for lost time which it does quite well despite the last arc being incredibly rushed.\\n\\n\r\nThe art work for Train in the first few episodes were beautiful, I don't blame Creed for wanting to see the killer look it was quite captivating. The fight scenes were done well not the best I have seen but nothing really to complain about. The backgrounds buildings were done well and set the tone of the anime without drawing away from the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack for Black Cat, I loved the opening song but the rest of the soundtrack... I didn't really notice it, I guess that can be classed as a good thing it wasn't so bad to mute or be distracting but when it comes to creating suspense and enhancing action scenes it's not really doing it's job.\\n\\n\r\nUgh. This is where my problem with the anime lies Train Heartnet's character development, when I got to episode 8 I had to pause the anime to check I hadn't missed any episodes I looked on Wikipedia I apparently was on the correct one and six months had passed. From assassin to goon in an opening sequence and becoming surprisingly chatty whoever his therapist was they should set up a shop in Apostles of the Stars and all the problems would be solved. For those saying \"well six months have passed\" I hardly believe that a lifetime of murder and Cloud Strife syndrome is overcome in that short amount of time. I would of felt better about the transformation if it was gradual and was included in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series up until episode 8 and the anime became preoccupied with looking at the scenery. Though it did rescue itself from good ol' filler pie and continue on with the story and I found the end product satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would say it's probably unworthy of the 7 I have given it. Don't get me wrong the anime had some great ideas it just fell at the last hurdle, Black Cat was held up by it's supporting characters, interesting story and great art style.The anime feels like an advert for the manga \"here is a poorly executed anime, would you like to buy our manga?\" No, no I don't. An anime should be able to stand on it's own and not be held up by it's better manga counterpart. With only 24 episodes to work with it spent too much time on dillydallying and parts became rushed and parts seemed unnecessary. If you are looking for comedy with action then this is for you, if you are looking for a dark story with character developments then you're in the wrong place.",

            "content": "I didn't see much of the story unravel, I only saw episode one, but what I did see was highly confusing. I understand in action scenes the need to change frames often, but even in the first fight sequence the frames change so much you can't tell whats going on. The writing is so awful and cheesy. Black Cat, \"I'm here to bring bad luck.\" What, are you joking? Thats the coolest thing you could think of.\r\nThe Art style is probably the best thing about this show.\r\nI guess the sound wasn't too bad, but nothing ground breaking here. \r\nThe main character, or the guy withthe eye patch, seems like an interesting person at first but after using his lame power, he can see five minutes into the future, you might want to reconsider. He has this vision of somebody dieing and thinks that it is going to happen. If it's going to happen you may as well give up because you can't stop it. This happens all the time in other anime. The Black Cat character is your clich\u00e9 short badass who has super powers and just kills everybody. Then after  Black Cat, or Train Heartnet his real name ( which is a really dumb name by the way), gets a cut on his face, which also happens in almost every other anime, some Homo (He is clearly a homo because he says\" Oh you scratched Train's beautiful, pretty-boy face, I'll have to kill you for hurting my lover) comes over and kills the other guy that cut his face.   \\n\r\nWell yeah I know \"I only saw one episode, How can I say the show sucks after only seeing one episode?\"Considering how many other better animes there are out there why waste my time with this one if the first episode sucks so much?",

It is very suspenseful and not to mention funny\r\n      Secondly, I should say the art is pretty good. The action is nice, but tbh, I think the characters could be cuter.\r\n      Secondly, the sound is pretty good too~ I like Train's voice, and Eve sounds so cute!\r\n      In additon, the character is great.I like how most voice actors and actresses have a voice that matches the character's personality. However, one concern I have for that is that sometimes a character can be.. out of character. Either than that, I enjoyed this anime. It was outstanding. 8 stars!",

            "content": "*This is an archive from my Anime-Planet account*\r\nCritic's Log - Earthdate: July 21, 2012. Review #13: Black Cat\r\nThe reason I do these intros to my reviews is because I felt like putting intros in my reviews. I like Anime because I enjoy animation. I also like to critique these animes because almost every anime has it's strengths and weaknesses. I am an unofficial critic and my reviews are strictly opinion. I also review these animes like a proper gentleman and not some stark, raving fanboy. I am not picky when it comes to reviewing anime. Anyway, enough with the intro and let's dash right into... BLACK CAT\\n\\n\r\nTrain Heartnet is a member of the secret society known as Chronos and he is known as the Black Cat because of his quick reactions to attacks and his title is Number Thirteen and has a tattoo with the roman numeral of the number 13. He is an unstoppable master gunman, a cold and unfeeling killer until he meets a young woman named Saya who happens to be a bounty hunter or \"Sweeper\". She teaches him the value of human life and how to live in order to repent for one's mistakes rather than die because of them. Through her, Train learns to love and care for other people as he later becomes a Sweeper and travels with some companions.\\n\\n\r\nTo be technical, this is a Studio Gonzo production and... I am not going to bash the living hell out of Gonzo on this show because to be honest, Black Cat is not one of the bad eggs that Gonzo has made. I have heard that Gonzo has some bad shows before and since and I know that there are some okay animes they made as well and this is one of them. The animation isn't at all terrible but I can say is that it could have looked better at some places but I got to commend Studio Gonzo on a couple of notes.\\n\\n\r\n1. They actually put effort into making the show entertaining and they really put in some cool visual styles, some use of these visual styles are slightly hit and miss, but it has some nice trick animation from time to time.\\n\\n\r\n2. They also used little 3D computer animation on this anime which Gonzo is infamously known for.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as the entertainment value Black Cat has. There are other issues Black Cat has that do need to be addressed. One of them is the number of characters that you'll see in this show, there are about 6 to 7 litters of characters shown in Black Cat. You got Train, Sven, Rinslet, and Eve being the main cast, you got the Chronos numbers, then there's the Apostles of the Star, Townspeople, so on and so on. There are a lot of characters. This show has way too many characters. This is somewhat part of the entertainment value for Black Cat, but the problem with this number of characters is that some of them aren't developed that well. But what about the main cast? Well, Sven is a delight to watch! He acts suave because he likes to act like a gentleman. Sven is also great comic relief for Black Cat. Rinslet Walker is alright to begin with and pretty much stays that way till the end. Eve is an interesting character, but the one character that seems to get some criticism is the main lead Train Heartnet. At first, Train was this mysterious, quiet gunman. He also was a bit of a boring lead at times to start off with. That is until he becomes a Sweeper... This also leads to another flaw with Black Cat. at the Time he was a Chronos, he was quiet and mysterious. After he left Chronos and after Saya dies, he became more of a chatterbox, and he was a bit cocky and energetic and there was no transition to these behaviors. If this was Gonzo's attempt from trying to avoid making Train look one-dimensional, this was not the best way to do it, because as hard as they tried... Train is a bit one-dimensional. But the supporting main cast really saved the show's ass. Shin Itagaki (The director of Black Cat) still deserves some credit for making sure that Black Cat had some entertainment value. I will admit that they do use some clich\u00e9 tropes but nothing to get people dropping this show. For example, Creed's goal is to take over the world\\n\\n\r\nOf course, with Train at his side...\\n\\n\r\nThe music by Taku Iwasaki is not bad but this might not be his best but he probably has better recognition before and since, he composed the Rurouni Kenshin prequel OVA's before Black Cat and he composed the animes such as Gurren Lagann and Soul Eater since Black Cat. So... is the music for Black Cat any good? Well, it's not bad and there are some mixtures of genres and it fits in pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for both English and Japanese are listenable. The original Japanese version is graciously over the top and that is not bad for Black Cat because that is what the show sort of needs with the material that Gonzo produced, Keiji Fujiwara (The Seiyuu of Sven Vollfied) is an example. I got nothing bad to say about Fujiwara-san, he's an awesome Seiyuu. The English Dubbed version makes the characters sound normal. This is also dubbed by Funimation and they are known for their consistency for good quality dubs. This is from one of their early days which the quality was just a bit low. This is not a terrible dub, but it is not outstanding to say the least. There are a couple of standout performances in the dub, one is Brandon Potter (The English voice of Sven), and Chris Patton (the English voice of Creed), and Mr. Patton sure sounds like he had way too much fun voicing Creed, I could say the same thing to Shinichiro Miki with his performance as Creed. Miki-san sounds like he had too much fun as well voicing Creed. The English dub is listenable. I could say that this just leads up to preference. There's not much to compare when it comes to picking a language track. Tyler Walker would get recognition later on as an ADR director, but he did pretty good on Black Cat.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw would probably be its story, Black Cat's story is a bit of a mixed bag of catnip. I think the explanation of the story earlier was enough to explain. The action element really saved Black Cat's Tail... Even though the direction by Shin Itagaki is a little flawed, it's not absolutely terrible in the long run but there is one thing that makes me wonder about Black Cat. I wonder if Black Cat was inspired by Cowboy Bebop in the long run, think about it... Bounty Hunters, Syndicates, Some of the main cast being unfortunate bounty hunters, and Train's past catching up to him (sort of).\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the Biblical references that are used in Black Cat are kind of a nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Cat is available from Funimation, the manga by Kentaro Yabuki is also available by Viz Media. A Light Novel called \"Black Cat: The Star's Afterglow\" has not made it overseas. The Black Cat videogames \"The Mechanical Angel\", and \"The Black Cat's Concerto\" also never made it overseas.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, Black Cat is a rare treat by a studio that has had its share of criticism from some people. The story isn't perfect, but the action scenes and some characters really gave the show some value for entertainment. This anime was not a waste of my time and this anime might not be for everyone. Animes like this is what I would like to call \"Popcorn Anime\", because this anime can have a bit of mindless fun.\\n\\n\r\nI give Black Cat a 7 out of 10, It is GOOD!\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to leave a comment and get yourself a glass or bottle of milk",

The art style was mediocre at best; the overly-cut fight scenes left little to be desired and the lack of character development really put a damper on my interest in Black Cat. My favorite character was Sven Vollfied, as he seemed to be the most multi-dimensional character in the show. The first few episodes started on the right note, then gradually disintegrated into a muddle of blah with unexplained character changes and utter confusion. It's a shame, really, because the seriesdid hold potential in the first five episodes or so. In summary, if you're looking for an intriguing plot with equally captivating characters in an action setting, skip Black Cat.",

The initial mise-en-sc\u00e9ne has style, points to some nice characters, and grabs you with its awesome art and sound.\r\nBut you'll soon be disappointed, as inspiration fades and the episodes soon turn into a pour-whatever-comes-into-your-mind-and-make-it-look-as-if-it-were-good. \r\nThere is a promise of a good plot, with secret organizations, killers, and supernatural beings. There is also a promise of interesting characters. But all this truly is is an excuse to make quick money by putting together sketches of ideas which aren't really original per se. \r\nThey just become sillyexcuses for vulgar fight scenes, which should appeal to younger audiences in that they blend supernatural techniques and fast action. Then, there is the big rivaliity between two characters which is some sort of poor spinoff from cowboy bebop.\\n\\n\r\nGlobally, you're better off not watching this. Do download the OST though!

The same situation occurred when watching Black Cat. I am pleasantly surprised to say that Black Cat is a pretty damn good anime. \r\nThe time I spent watching this show seemed to slip away, as I was drawn into a world of assassins, sweepers, and secret organizations.\r\nThe story revolves around an assassin named Train, a mysterious girl named Eve, and a bounty hunter(otherwise known as a sweeper) named Sven. These main charactershave great chemistry together. The main villain, Creed, was an extremely interesting character, with a demented, psychopathic, and flamboyant personality. Creed has an obsessive interest in Train to the point where he makes a statue and painting of Train. There are numerous plot twists devices throughout the story, especially at the beginning of the show. These plot twists prevent the show from becoming stagnant and stale.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and the sound are both well done, although I can't recall listening to any memorable soundtracks. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough Black Cat is a really well done Shounen anime, but still provides a few of the flaws of most anime of its genre. For example, I noticed that a lot of Creed's nameless soldiers are usually easily defeated in a comic matter, and that kind of thing annoys me. This is only a small detail that can easily be overlooked.\\n\\n\r\nBlack Cat is not a perfect anime, but it is very good one at that. The show contained a deep plot and riveting action scenes that held my interest the entire ride through this show. I had a great time watching this series and I highly recommend this show.",

Then it all turned into a usual shounen anime, not very logic, not very hard to understand, and the end was so strange and so didn't fit into the story, that finally disappointed me. \r\nI didn't like the \"nanotechnology\" storyline, it seems improbable, like the authors just wanted to use a mysterious word ^^ \r\nSo, and did the creators wantto make a comedy or a drama? Yes, there are some comic moments, but they absolutely don't go with the dramatic stories and sad flashbacks. \\n\r\nI also don't believe that Train's personality could change so. That isn't well-grounded, I think.\\n\r\nWell, to my mind, Black Cat is not a bad anime, but it isn't great or masterpiece, too.",

            "content": "Black Cat has the best introduction to a story I have ever seen. Within the very first forty seconds, anyone will be drawn. It shows a scene that will happen later, similar to High School of the Dead, except this scene does not take place in episode one, and it is more tragic. Hanabi (fireworks) are lightened at night, then two men appear to be having a beautifully animated duel, one with a sword and the other with a gun. The one with the sword says: \"Those eyes. . . Those are the eyes! That woman. . . (A lying woman's bloody (which is blackdue to censorship, I believe) hand is displayed) Because of that woman's curse, you are. . .! (Crying and wielding the sword)\" Then the scene ends with the other guy yelling.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of this show changes significantly after a few episodes. Firstly, a man called Train Heartnet works for an organization, named Chronos, whose members bear a Roman numeral on their body. He is number XIII, also known as Black Cat/Kuro Neko. Train is a highly praised member, who kills bad people with a gun (the same person from the beginning) in the name of Chronos, telling his victims right before their death that he \"came to deliver bad luck.\" A man who has worked as an informant for years has never heard of a target escaping Heartnet. Train's friend, who wields a sword (the other individual at the start), applauds the former's talent, saying that only them two can strike a person at a fatal spot with one hit, and that Heartnet is subarashi (amazing). However, despite how cold he looks, he is actually tormented by his past and the guilt of single-handedly executing people. His next job is considered more difficult, and number XIII gets briefed by a woman, Sephiria. Sven, a sweeper, intends to arrest Lib Tyrant, a former gang lord who is running for office in Bracchio City and is about to marry his fiance, Joanna. After having alcohol spilled on him at a party for Lib, Sven goes to the bathroom to clean himself up, taking the patch over his eye off. Tyrant walks in with his bodyguards as well, and, with his vision eye, which can see five minutes into the future while draining his power, Sven is surprised to foresee Lib's death. . .\\n\\n\r\nBased on the first episode alone, the story, I have to say, is intricate. This is not your dumb, weak kid trying to be strong; this is not your beat-them-up children's superhero; this is not your funny, clumsy newbie gaining experience; no, this is a serious boy who is not easy to mess with, who has a dark past, and who cries for those he murders and his parents.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the opening sequence (and people's comments on the series) suggests a lighter mood later on. The lyrics are wonderful and the tune is nice, but I am not a big fan of the visuals, because I think they should be more gloomy/depressing. It shows small scenes of the important ones of the cast. Even less appropriate is the ending sequence, which starts off okay, but soon it becomes a joke of a song, having miniatures of the main characters turn into silly looking neko (cats), and sounding like something out of a Miyazaki movie.\\n\\n\r\nSo, yes, good story, check; fine animation, check; excellent seiyuu, check; comedy, check; drama, check; action, check; and adventure, check. I would compare this anime to Rurouni Kenshin and Ubel Blatt, in terms of a series containing a powerful, but sorrowful protagonist. Highly recommended.",

But here's the thing: both of the two shows are really, really good. \r\nThe differences between Black Cat and Darker than Black remind me of those between Fullmetal Alchemist and FMA: Brotherhood. One is more fun (Brotherhood and Black Cat), and the other is more thoughtful (Fullmetal Alchemistand Darker than Black). But whereas the difference between the two FMA shows are rather subtle, Black Cat and Darker than Black are on opposite ends of the spectrum. Just like how Darker than Black is remarkably clever (see my review of it), Black Cat is one of the most enjoyable and funny shows I've watched. The characters rock, the animation lends itself well to comedy, and the voice acting is superb. This show is a lot of fun. I would highly recommend it.",

Usually producers seem to have trouble squeezing in all the necessary elements of a long series into the limited number of episodes, but Black Cat has a bit different approach. Some characters and events have been removed, but then again there are some completely new characters and added scnenes topped with completely different, or maybe I should say extra, ending. \r\nThe story revolves around Train Heartnet, a gunman who works for the organization called Chronos but decides to leavethe organization and lead a different life as a bounty hunter with his new gang. Important themes in the series are choosing one's own road and coming in terms with past. Story is very humoristic with a lot of comedy relief.  The fight scenes are mixture of guns and other 'believable' weapons and different 'powers', giving the show a fantasy element. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is one of Black Cat's strongest points, and it's superbly expressed, having it's own special rhytm and flow. The characters are very charismatic and both contrast and complement each other. Especially the 'main trio' is crafted in a manner that allows lot of spontaneous apparing jokes to spring out from their interaction.\\n\\n\r\nIn a nusthell, Black Cat is nice and easy shounen anime. It's enjoyable, but don't memorable. While some scenes, especially in the earlier episodes, are darker than the others, Black Cat doesn't even either even aim for being remembered for it's heart breaking moments or fails at it. Also, a lot has been lost in the translation between the manga and the anime. While the anime isn't bad, it could have been a lot of better if the producers hadn't taken some of the many liberties they did.",

            "content": "Black Cat is a very simple anime. While good and entertaining and all, it just doesn't stick out that well in the sea of shonen anime. Although, average, it's done rather well.\r\nStory: The story is pretty good. I mean, it's certainly not the best, but it's still enjoyable. That is, until you get to the last few episodes. It gets rather repulsive and disgusting, if I do say so myself. But the thing it has is consistency. No matter how good or bad the episodes get, you are always cheering for the good guys to win. You want to see the victory that these peopleget, and how the attain it, and how they defeat the bad guys. If you're into something like that, this anime is perfect for you.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The Heroes are great. They each have there own unique individual personalities that make them special. Train is cool, Eve is collected and awesome, and Sven is just badass! Sure Rinslet is not that great, but, the others makes up for that.  I think that the flawed characters are the villains. They're just not that good. They're either assholes, obsessive, or just flat out disgusting. But, in a sense, they work. The villains are so awful, that you like the good guys even more. So, I'm not sure is that's what they were going for, but it still gets the job done.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is rather well done. It has this sense of similarity about it, but it works. It's dark when it needs to be, and it's light when it needs to be. It's just a simple art style done right.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OST was pretty good, but not all that great. The Opening was OK. I found myself skipping it from time to time, but it wasn't bad. If you wanna talk bad, the first ending was really bad. It doesn't fit at all, and it sounds almost as annoying as Durarara's first ending. there second ending was magnificent. It dealt with the serious side of Black Cat, and it is a smooth melody that you can easily enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It maybe only slightly different from other shonen anime, but it's worth viewing. I wouldn't pass it up, but I also wouldn't wouldn't call it a masterpiece either. 8/10",

It's just pure adventure and fun. \r\nThe anime on the other hand is a grave injustice to it's source material. Lots of things were cut out of the original manga and a lot of characters/villians/story arcs were either removed or changed. The ending was extremely rushed where as the manga had a cool buildup and showdown at the very end with a decent emotional payoff. \r\nStick to themanga folks. Please.",

The characters are also badass! Which I will be talking about in this review.\r\nI find it strange how the protagonist is called Train but I can relate to him because of his feline instincts. His backstory really made me feel sorry for him since we know what happened to his parents. \r\nSven reminds me of Big Boss of Metal Gear Solid because of the eye patch he wore even though he only wore it because one eye is yellowas a black cat's eye. Eve is one badass kid! Now you wouldn't want to mess with her. \\n\\n\r\nI really do recommend this anime. It's full of action and comedy. Man there are some scenes that really cracked me up!",

            "content": "Black Cat is a quite nicely animated show. Since there are many battles, often with supernatural powers involved, this is an important issue. Battles flow smoothly, and, despite the crazy mix of powers involved, it is kept at a fairly realistic level. The settings themselves seems to be some odd kind of mishmash between western surroundings coupled with various futuristic elements like huge laboratory setups and the occational computerized add-on. Even one of the main characters is an example of that, but more on this later.\r\nSven Vollfied is maybe one of the most hilarious and charming goofballs I've encountered within this kind of genre. I'veheard him described as a mix between Vash the stampede and Spike Spiegel, which might be accurate, I guess. (Having seen neither of the aforementioned shows, I can't confirm that, but it sounds.... well, sound.) At first glance, he seems like quite the harmless guy. He often gets into arguments with the local cafe hostess for never really seeming to be able to pay for the coffee he drinks while he sits there and read whatever newspaper he can get his hands on. When things get serious, however, he's shown as more than able to handle himself.\\n\r\nBlack Cat is..... he's interesting, I guess, for a character who is named Train Heartnett. There, I said it. TRAIN! HEARTNETT! He is the aforementioned top agent and assassin in Chronos, sporting nearly supernatural abilities at handling his firearms, a simple looking handgun with a \"XIII\" marking on it. While he isn't the most interesting conversationalist in the group, he never disappoints when it comes to making battle scenes look kickass. (No pun intended.) In the duration of the show, he leaves Chronos at the urges of a young girl, and eventually joins up with Sven and the others after their rescue operation.\\n\\n\r\nThe... well, the target of said rescue operation is Eve, a nano-machine construct made for battle. When we first meet her (yes, HER), she is held captive by a person who intend to break her -- to prepare her to become the ultimate killing machine, which is made all the more unsettling, seeing as she looks like a young girl. In fact, she reminds me a lot of another young girl in another show I've seen recently; namely Ren from Erementar Gerad, a fact that is made all the more apparent seeing as they're both weapons by nature. Of course, things never go as planned, and inevitably, she meets up with Sven, who promise to take her away and to teach her more about what it is like to lead a human life.\\n\\n\r\nIt would seem that the last character, Rinslet Walker, is the only one who doesn't seem to be blessed with anything remotely close to supernatural powers. Not that it makes her helpless by any means, though, as she might very well be the Faye Valentine to Sven's Spike/Vash combo. She's sneaky and intelligent, but also fairly able to look after herself when she heads out on her own.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the antagonists seems to be filled with the same kind of strange people that makes up the main team. Ranging from voodoo practicioners to kids on hoverboards a la Back to the future. From bespectabled men in large hats to young schoolgirls with flame attacks. And in the leader's chair, we pretty much have a Sephiroth-type character at his most insane. They've got plans, they've got powers and mr. Sephiroth seems to harbor a rather unsettling interest in our main lead Train. You know, Train Heartnett, our ex-Chronos operative? Yeah, I'm still rather taken aback by that name. Bear with me.Thus far, there has been explosions. There has been large fights and interesting character introductions. This show never sits still for long, because there are always people to rescue or hunt down, always things to figure out and locations to find. And, from what I've seen, there are also change in alliances, which is bound to keep things interesting. Few shows have been so flamboyantly energetic as Black Cat, and for all that I love slower, more reflective shows, I would have to admit that I LIKE this show. A lot!\\n",

He's really good at his job and is able to a kill a person in public without anyone noticing. One day he gets a mission to kill a bio weapon which turns out to be a young girll and is confromted by an old CIS agent Sven which tries to save the girl named Eve. \r\nIn the end Train leaves the associationhe was killing for and Eve runs away from the person who tormented. Offcorse alot of people stand against Train running loose and Eve too.

You'll have to watch it to see..\\n\r\nCharacters (7) - the characters were well shaped and as you keep watching the anime more and more of their pasts unfold.

Then as I got along further in the first episode this girl named Saya appeared and it looked like she was going to be a main character in the making who was going to change Trains character throughout the entire series. But then she gets killed in the 6th episode! This was one of the biggest and craziest twists I have ever seen. This show is about as unpredictable as it gets and that's one the things I absolutely love about blackcat. The action is very engaging and not over the top like some anime are. They do a very good job of engaging you into the story and the comedy element they add to it just makes it even more enjoyable. This is definitely an amazing anime and I would definitely suggest watching it.",

Though I admit it is tough to compete with the excellent manga series, I was hoping for a lot more when it came to this series.  \r\nI give the story a 6 because the series tried to follow the manga but at the same time the anime took the series into their own hands.  They changed the plot and character interaction drastically.  There were a lot of holes in the plot so it can be hard to follow if you havn't read the manga.\r\nThe art is terrific, 9.\r\nGood sound effects but I hardlyheard any music if there was any.\\n\r\nCharacters, 9, though they changed the story the characters are the same lovable sweepers we know from the manga.\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 6, for the same reason for story.\\n\r\nOverall, I give it a 7.  The beginning, drastically different from how the manga began, was very good.  It beautifully painted the story between Train and Saya and her murder, but once they tried to get into the actual story that the manga followed, it began to be butchered.  It went from saya's murder to fighting the Apostles of the Stars, who had no previous mention of in this series.",

            "content": "It's amazing how far some people will push themselves for a cause or sometimes a certain person. There are those that don't even know how far they really can go until they find something they consider, worth fighting for. It is one of those things that a person cannot feel until l they have actually found it.\r\nBlack Cat is a story about people and peoples development with other people based on the situation they're all faced with. It seems to have three major plot line in its 24 episodes that all seem continue on from the fragments of the previous as if it were abuild up to an even bigger threat. While this makes for great entertainment, it kind of gives the feeling they were trying to milk as much as they could out of a certain group of people.\\n\\n\r\nArt runs as standard for the most part with only lighting taking major effect when the scene or environment background require it to add a stronger feel to the scene. It almost makes emotional scenes at around the same time of day so they can reuse lighting effects which if noticed can almost ruin the mood the scene is trying to play because you cant help but think you've seen it before.\\n\\n\r\nSound. Its everywhere and its very well done, from standard effects for objects or musical pieces. Rarely do objects have the same sound sample, so almost everything is given a unique piece and when music is used its either the heavy action scenes where its addition puts you on the edge of your seat, or its used at the moments where the emotional attachment is needed to make the viewers want to know what happens next.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the anime, character development is the tough one to touch on, as it has massive chunks of it at the start and ends of the main plot lines but between, while may not be fillers for story line, certainly lack in many ways of character building. Some characters get a back story explained while others you get hung up asking \"What made them choose this path?\" Which for some characters you really do want the question answered.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment was quite good, even though the large personality changes some characters go through from episode to episode, can be annoying to put up with. Black Cat seems to have a way of adding in points that seem boring but mix them between areas that seem to be either quite humorous or capture your enthusiasm, making up for it almost instantly. It also does prove that having someone you can rely on can really uplift even the loneliest of lives.",

A certain turn of events developed the plot of the story but also lost interest for me as well. Some people really like this anime, just not for me I guess. It's one of those ones where u could watch the first 5 episodes and be done with it- u get the idea of the story pretty much. I would not recommend this one- didnt overly enjoy it very much at all.",

I have to say that I understand why it is one of the more loved series' in the new millenia, but the thing is, I found it . . . deflated by the 23rd episode. \r\nDislikes: The characters, especially the protaganist, were inconsistent. One minute they're serious and deadly and everything that looks evil, the next they're happy and eat eveything in sight and laugh and became perverted. It confused me. And then the ending, while people will disagree that it was \"epic\", I will not go with such a word. It was. . . just okay. Average and probably one of the more boring parts of the show. Like, the beginning episodes were amazing, but by the end I was just ready for it to be over. I gave the art and sound high reviews, but that doesn't mean anything to me when it comes to judging anime and manga. \\n\r\nLikes: Creed. He, like, made the show with all the stories surrounding him. He was, to me, the most interesting character in the show. Also, the plot was amazing, though I believe they could've done a better job with the same characters and just made it a little more exciting. \\n\r\nOverall, I give it a 6/10.",

Or, let me say; the show certainlydidn't have anything negative for me to point out.  There were no upskirt pantyshots, but I guess the show was better without it.

Being constantly thrown back and forth from wacky slapstick comedy to serious plot is just irritating. I don\u2019t think it would have hurt the series to lose a few of the comedic moments. The other major flaw is that Black Cat goes downhill rapidly after about 10 episodes. I would say episode 11 is the beginning of the end. The plot just seems contrived after this point and the ending is rushed and just plain terrible. It\u2019sdisappointing to see this happen to an anime that started off so strong.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of positives to Black Cat. Action scenes are fun and suitably over the top. Characters are likable and memorable with good quality voice acting. And for half of the series at least, the story solid and imaginative. Even though the ending isn\u2019t great it is still entertaining to watch and not a waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nA more detailed review can be seen at: http://nikkimanga.com/black-cat-review-anime/",

Although quite humorous, the series does have plenty of good depth to it, without being depressingly dark. The biggest thing I have against it is a strange sub-plot line after the primary one [potential spoiler!] that takes up the last few episodes. The only other complaint I have is that the animation itself can get a bit strange in parts, and difficult to understand in the action bits.A good yarn overall though, and good for anyone  ten plus I'd say.",

After the first episode, I stopped watching Black Cat and couldn't watch it again because the other episodes might make it worse.\r\nFor the good stuff, the Art and Sound are pretty good. For the voice acting, it was solid (both subbed and dubbed) andall of the voice actors did well with their personality. But it was a shame that they bothered to do such a good job on this confusing anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I am not going to think about this anime anymore. Please go watch better anime shows. You wanna be frightened by the female screams like me? No? Then go watch something else instead of this confusing anime.\\n\\n\r\nI know it's short, but here are the scores.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3 out of 10\\n\r\nArt: 7 out of 10\\n\r\nSound: 9 out of 10\\n\r\nCharacter: 3 out of 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3 out of 10\\n\r\nOverall: 3 out of 10",

Still, it was pretty good. I really liked the art, though I did have an issue with the hideous (in my very strong opinion) coat that Train ends of wearing. The characters were pretty good. I'd have to say I liked Train when he was the Black Cat in the beginning of the anime more than the laid-back, always-eating, guy he morphed into but he still possessed the kind of bad-ass characteristicsI always liked so he was alright. The rest of the main characters were well developed and their pasts were explained without bringing the entire story to a halt. I only gave the \"Enjoyment\" factor a rating of 8 because it held my attention really well (hard to do when you're as easily distracted as me) but I didn't particularly like the ending. Black Cat was a good anime with a good storyline and I'd watch it again sometime if I get the chance.",

Someone didn't go broke making this from lack of income?\" type, and the \"obviously just having fun kind of poking fun at itself\" type. Now, I have not read the manga, so I can't make a comparison if this is a poor adaption, or if it this was intentional from the manga as well. \r\nDisclaimer aside, I am a huge fan of the second type of B-rated science fiction, and believe it has its own art,and that Black Cat nailed it with perfection for the most part. It had its moments that it was a bit too silly for my taste, but those moments were few and far between, overall it was just awesome fun. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Black Cat are great, and they all work very, very well together. Even Train's somewhat bipolar personality lends itself to a certain level realistic-characteristic. Creed is the most infuriatingly irritating villain I have come across in my lengthy list of tv shows, and after a while his insanity makes him so disgusting he's almost likable. Sven takes the cake for the funness of his gentleman's code, and never fails to make me smile.",
