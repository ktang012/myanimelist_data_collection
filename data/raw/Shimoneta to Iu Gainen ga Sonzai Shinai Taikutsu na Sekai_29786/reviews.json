            "content": "\"What's the point of dirty jokes anyway if they aren't 'wrong'? They're appealing *because* they are wrong. They excite us *because* we have to be secretive. Because they're devilish, they shine. Because they're twisted, they entice us. That is why I vowed to become the 'devil' to crush this boring world where the concept of dirty jokes does not exist!\" \u2013 Kajou Ayame\r\nAt first glance this may sound like a pretty stupid quote, but when you think about it there's a lot of truth behind it. In fact, Shimoneta as a whole functions in more or less the same way as underneath the hyperactive, wackycomedy there are a lot of shots fired not only against many societal norms, but also the censorship laws of Japanese media.\\n\\n\r\nFirst thing first though: let's be honest here, how many people actually thought this was going to be a good anime before this season started airing? My guess is not so many, but Shimoneta came roaring seemingly completely out of nowhere and proved itself as one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen in anime, but also one of the strangest ones. The setting is honestly pretty similar to 1984 of all things, as it features a totalitarian, dystopian society with heavy governmental censorship. In this case however, the censorship is solely about sexual content. In fact all forms of pornography, sexual education, or anything along those lines has been completely banned from society for the last decade, and every citizen is forced to wear a vocal monitor at all times which summons the police to arrest them should they ever say a dirty word. Enter Kajou Ayame, a.k.a. the lewd terrorist \u201cBlue Snow\", a self-proclaimed freedom fighter who distributes sexual material wherever she goes in an attempt to educate people. Alongside our unfortunate protagonist Okuma Tanukichi whom she blackmails into assisting her, the two of them initiate a campaign of obscenities against the government with the hopes of one day managing to reform society to what it once was.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on for days talking about the utter lunacy of Shimoneta, but I'd rather just recommend you to experience it for yourself as there is no way you can properly express its sheer absurdness with mere words. All I'll say is that it although it is fairly uneven, when it peaks it's without a doubt one of the best comedies ever.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is definitely worth talking about though is the underlying message that the show is very clearly trying to send. After all, in a nutshell the entire story is essentially about fighting against the government's violation of freedom of speech and getting rid of all forms of censorship throughout society. It doesn't exactly take a genius to figure out what the author is trying to say with that. I'm pretty sure most people who watch anime on a regular basis are very familiar with just how severe the censorship can be for it. Whether it's about gore, sexual themes or anything else, there are always tons of things that have to be left out. Not only does this hinder the authors' and illustrators' ability to express themselves properly, but it can also severely neuter the experience for the series' viewers. And really, in this day and age even a kid can access essentially anything via the internet, so it's not like you're actually \u201cprotecting\" anyone from graphical content by blocking it out anyway, not to mention that if someone didn't want to see that kind of stuff they wouldn't be watching the anime in question in the first place, censored or not. Shimoneta feels a lot like an author who had gotten fed up with the current system and who decided to write this story out of spite. Whether or not that is actually the case I do not know, but the fact that there are a lot of political messages in this story is undeniable. Although if it's really true that the author came up with the idea for Shimoneta when he was drunk like he claims to, then that only makes the whole thing even more peculiar.\\n\\n\r\nEither way, regardless of whether you're watching this anime for the absurd comedy or the underlying messages, Shimoneta does a great job at both. It stands out as one of the most positively surprising anime I have seen in an extremely long time, and it will be remembered for being both hilarious and thought-provoking at the same time. Not many series can boast with that achievement.\\n\\n\r\nNow sadly I don't really think the awareness that Shimoneta might raise will be enough to do anything about the censorship laws in Japan, but at least it stands up for itself and dares to make a statement. It's a step in the right direction at the very least, and I can only hope that more series will have the guts to do the same in the future.",

            "content": "\"Nothing is disgusting....nothing\" - Okuma, episode 12\r\nShimoneta and Prison School have got to be the dirtiest and lewd shows this season, or this year. But Shimoneta sucks and Prison School is far superior. Why do I say this about two shows that are about on par in sexual content? Well then, read the review.\r\nShimoneta's premise is that all that is lewd and sexual has been banned for over a decade, and any use of sexual things via words, or objects will get you into legal trouble. Now our 'heroes' are off to fight a war and take back the justice which is all that iserotic that Japan is in dire need of. I hate this show not because it has ass and titties and panties...and other sex stuff, it's because of the characters poorly delivered dialogue, development, and just plain character. The story has no connected ideas, it's goes from point A to Point C, D, and B. Our cast is going around spreading erotic pictures and magazines to spread knowledge of the ignorance the country is in. The end of the series doesn't resolve anything really. There is this supposed huge conflict against the government baddies that's hardly ever explored, and the other terrorist organizations who are barely mentioned or shown for 2 seconds. The idea of the show is good, it's loosely reflected upon Japan's lack of sexual interaction among the young people with the declining Japanese population. But just because the idea behind the story is good, doesn't mean the execution is the same.\\n\\n\r\nShimoneta prizes itself with its pathetic characters who have no range nor substance. There is a complete lack of immersion and characterization. Okuma is every FUCKING reluctant brown hair male archetype, who is so plain and unoriginal, he has no quality to him. Any of the four boys from Prison School would've made a better protagonist. While Okuma is a terrible main character, Kajou has it worse. A character with substantial motivation and promise only to be hindered by her vastly pointless use of dialogue to spout unnecessary lewd words for the sake of it. You can't go one fucking sentence without her saying dick, just because. \"Oh but it's the point of the show\".......no, that shit is just bad writing. There are times where her lewd talk is appropriate in the situation but that's already when you're tired of her speaking. Additionally, Kajou's characterization and development is nonexistent. Actually, no character in the show has development, at all. Essentially, what we get is a plot that achieves nothing substantial enough to justify the span of 12 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nDialogue in general is terrible, TURRIBLE. It is unashamedly cheesy, while it should be ashamed, for how immature it handles immature use of sexual content. And it fails miserably. The comedy is just more dick and pussy jokes that get tiring really fast. Even for someone, myself, does the same thing, I don't expect that kind of amateur writing in entertainment. Other characters such as Anna is completely defiled as a one dimensional sex obsessed freak in the most annoying way possible. She's not Sarutobe Ayume from Gintama who actually is far better and actually funny, being obsessed with Gintoki just as much, just not as lewd and disgusting (nothing is disgusting). Even Tsukimigusa who has a sort of might not be interesting back story to him, it's totally under utilized. The only real character I enjoyed was White Peak. Somehow he didn't bother me, he was actually the epitome of what this show could've been. I loved every moment of his character, and then he's gone, forever. Sad times it is.\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing bad to say about the art, it's fine. Subjective? I guess, whatever. I suppose you could say the sound in the show is good. Voice acting is well done and it sort of conveys the characters and setting until the characterization of the characters ruins it.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a bile of sticky white love nectar, earning itself a 3/10. It's a dick of show that can shove itself up it's own ass. Get it?! AHAHAHAHA...it's not funny. This show killed what potential that could be sexual humor in the next stage of evolution. But I think that statement is a far stretch. This show is off the charts of shows I can recommend and earns my shitty of shit face seal of approval.",

            "content": "Every season, there\u2019s usually one or a few series that you can\u2019t watch with your family like your little brother/sister or parents. Keep that in mind if you plan to watch this show.\r\nNow imagine this: \r\nA world where anything lewd, obscene, or considered \u201csexual\u201d is banned. And any attempts to practice such acts of obscenity can land you into jail. In Shimoseka, that\u2019s actually a reality. The government has apparently imposed their laws onto the public to obstruct any sort of obscene behavior. This also apparently includes sex education so children can forget about learning the logics of pregnancy, sexual abstinence, and all that otherstuff they teach you at school. At the center of the story, we have this young man named Tanukichi Okuma. His initial goal was to find Anna Nishikinomiya, a girl that he has admired and has a crush on. Apparently, luck strikes and he not only manages to find her as part of the Student Council but also gets close to Anna like a twist of fate. Unfortunately, this also puts Okuma in a complicated story when he gets involved with Blue Snow, a terrorist who seeks to abolish censorship laws. After reading all of this, you\u2019ll probably thinking...what the hell?\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s what I had thought at first anyways.\\n\\n\r\nThe show isn\u2019t shy on portraying its sexual themes. Its first few episodes easily establishes that committing lewd behavior is considered a capital crime. An example would be Okuma being hunted down by a group of public officers after being accused for obstructing justice with a \u201clewd act\u201d. Despite lacking evidence, he is targeted anyways until he is saved by Blue Snow. The series also isn\u2019t afraid to go far with its sex jokes such as heavily implied references that shows intercourse between flies. Blue Snow is also considered an infamous figure in their world with that signature panty on her head. In fact, there\u2019s little normal about anything regarding this show. Even Anna, the girl he admires the most, awakens her \u201cwild\u201d side while we learn how over exaggerated the government tries to impose its laws on the citizens. So in other words, it sort of makes Okuma the only normal character in the series. \\n\\n\r\nI would say Shimoseka is portrayed as more of a satire rather than anything to be taken as deep or serious. The way the government enforces its laws is similar to Big Brother from 1984. They are the eyes and are always watching you with their cameras, agents, and even \u201cpeace makers\u201d which are apparently devices that monitors\u2019 a person\u2019s movements. If anything is done that is considered lascivious, you can guess what happens next. A show like this can seem to be over the top and offensive at times. There is also rape jokes that is satired by cartoonish censors and fan disservice. Every episode also pushes forward SOX (a parody of censorship for the word, sex) with their goal that becomes more extreme as the story progresses. Blue Snow, also known as Ayame Kajou, is the complete antithesis of what Japanese authorities are trying to enforce. She wears a panty over her head, throws lewd pictures in public, and wears an obscene outfit with little clothing underneath her white cloak. Other characters also becomes a joke itself with their personalities. Example such as Otome with her artistically talent in drawing lewd artwork, Hyouka Fuwa with her fascination in studying the human body and sex behavior, or Kosuri\u2019s manipulative personality as a child. Okuma himself isn\u2019t immune to lewd acts in the show. Time after time, it\u2019s shown that he may secretly enjoy what Anna is doing with him. So in essence, every main character in the show becomes part of the formula. To say that a boring world where dirty jokes doesn\u2019t exist is an overstatement. Dirty jokes weren\u2019t invented in this series. They perfected it.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, the show\u2019s comedy is crude on most parts. The story itself is mostly nonsense and considered a satire. Story arcs that involves terrorists or assaults are supposed to be taken as parodies although recurring tropes can quickly grow old. None of the characters get any sort of depth because the series is more focused on abolishing censorship rather than character growth. However, I will say that the characters\u2019 roles can be quite entertaining to watch especially with how complicated some events can be. But when it all comes down to it, Shimoseka is a dirty joke of itself. It\u2019s fun to watch for some comedy such as Anna\u2019s batshit insane moments or public officials freaking out over the tiniest of lewd acts. If you\u2019ve seen Seitokai Yakuindomo or something similar, then it\u2019s easy to understand the intentions behind the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork for the series is pretty standard by J.C. Staff. Character designs for students are normal although when the story kicks in, everything becomes over the top. Censorship is played out as a joke with the cartoony drawings during inappropriate timings. Even certain words are blocked out as the show is seemingly self-aware of its premise. But as a show about dirty jokes, we do have quite a bit of ecchi moments ranging from Anna\u2019s intense expression of her love towards Okuma or some of the character designs for Blue Snow. There\u2019s also some mature content that is downsized by the satire involving sexual fluids and whatnot. The OP and ED theme song kind of go two folds. For one, it clearly satires the sexualization of the show. On the other hand, it\u2019s also portrayed as upfront for fan service and nothing more. Most of the soundtrack is mediocre and easily forgettable. However, the character voice mannerism is easily recognizable such as Anna\u2019s obscene moments or Blue Snow\u2019s signature laughs. \\n\\n\r\nSome people are probably wondering \u201cwhere were you when this hidden gem premiered?\u201d Oh yeah, this is one of those series that looks, seems, and is funny at first. But over time, it can grow old, and not to mention offensive at times. Still, I will give a vibrant effort in the series for putting a sheer amount of effort in satirizing many of its ideas. Most of the time, fan service is portrayed as mindless and boring. But in this series, it\u2019s played out more as a dirty joke like it should be. Now close your windows, lock your doors, and hope the neighbors don\u2019t wake up when you watch this. \\n",

            "content": "Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai was without a doubt one of the most unique comedy shows I watched and enjoyed during Summer 2015. It was full of energy and excitement, and most importantly a awesome and very memorable cast of characters. \r\nThere are lots of shows that have the dirty jokes in school setting however, Shimoseka's version of this differs greatly. Most noticeable it's more childish and immature with dialogue but the characters discuss mature content... however the once you get used to the character.. (mostly Ayame Kajo's) personality it really starts to grow on you. I noticed it's material,or humor if you will, is also like watching a western cartoon like South park... to a certain extent of course. The dirty jokes and foul language are what the show is about so I do not want to complain too much about that. \\n\\n\r\nI personally felt that the story was again, unique and pretty good. You will pretty much get an idea of what it's about by reading the description so I shouldn't really have to explain... that aside what I liked about the story was it was consistent. What I mean by that is ordinarily shows similar to Shimoseka...  or focuses on too many things which in time makes the story bad. Where as in Shimoneta it focuses on one thing but with many goals, Like hiding dirty magazines in school, obtaining erotic items, etc.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and character designs with the artwork I really appreciated seeing the cyber punk/futuristic setting and atmosphere that the show had. I noticed that lately there seems to be a larger increase of futuristic devices and technologies in anime's so shimoseka's wasn't really special, although I love the ideas of the PM's lol things were so bad... \\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs were something special too.. of all of the characters introduced designs that stood out most were Anna, mostly because of the artist unique choice of colours for her eyes, eyelashes, and hair. Lastly is of course is Ayame Kajo, whose school attire makes her look plain and geeky however when she transitions to her \"normal\" dirty joke loving self her appearance is much more loving. The rest are pretty good too.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and BGM was alright... nothing too special. Music in the show sounded like pretty generic pieces put together to match the shows rhythm and situations. For example I noticed that if there was a very sexual situation going on faster and intense music would play to match the scene. As I mention before the show and the characters are full of energy... (expect for Fuwa.... those bags under her eyes tell it all.)\\n\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment with this series was pretty high. I found myself highly engaged, and sometimes annoyed with the problematic situations that occurred during my time watching it. Again, the energy the characters have and the fast pacing of the shows events make it really enjoyable so if you decide to watch it expect wild... no SUPER WILD moments or events... things get really crazy.\\n\\n\r\nMy final thoughts are this, if you aren't interested in Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai then you can skip it, overall I would say that it isn't an anime that is worth sharing or recommending. I mean unless you're in a conversation with your friends or best mates about dirty comedies then be my guest. My overall score for it was 8/10 for being highly energetic, wonderful cast of characters, and in it's own unique  way creative. I'm also look forward to reading the last LN being released this year... so that too.\\n",

Holy fuck how did I not notice it?\\n\\n\r\nHold on.\\n\r\nlet me just- get some basic info about that...\\n\\n\r\nOK HERE WE GO\\n\r\nA story about a boy who lives in a world which has forbidden the uses of dirt words or anything to do with explicit sexual contents. After he left to join the Tokioka Academy, on his very first day he met a girl called \"Blue snow\", a girl with white panties on her face and nothing but white sheet over her body, who was known as the terrorist who broke all the laws just because she said some random dirty words in public (yeah I don't know either). Oh yeah, the boys name is Tanukichi Okuma, little mister innocent who joined the most cleanest school (seriously no one in that school knows about sex or how it works) just to follow the girl who was the only friend back then, known as Anna Nishikinomiya; the president of the Student Council and a daughter to her influential parents, whom are both responsible in enforcing the ever stricter public morality laws. (Did I mentioned he hated his father?) But of course, he got caught up in the action by meeting Ayame Kajou, a second year high school student at Tokioka Academy and also the Vice President of the school's student council, and eventually was forced to join her or else she would give him up to police (that poor fucker.) While the series go on, we are almost always greeted by the great and amazing narrator that honestly just annoyed me every time.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, as you can see the \"story\" itself doesn't sound too appealing, except...it does. The fact that they live in a world where no one even knows basic things like what a fucking sex is sounds weird, yet interesting. It can be a very weird anime to follow, especially when the shit hits the fan in ep 4 but it is still a very unique and crazy as fuck anime.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals/sound track: \\n\r\nThis is something I am not so happy to talk about. The OST of this series has the mixture of \"yeah its cool\" and \"what the actual fuck is this?\" which, depending on your view, can mean that the OST is shit, ok, or good. The opening is something that got stuck in my brain, its weird; funny; catchy and just plain \"wtf\"? Which is a type of music I sometimes do listen to (yeah, judge all you want). The same can be said to the Ending, though I must say the ending was more catchy than opening. The rest of the sound track can at times.....just....plain. Nothing really amazing but also not something shit. It can be at times but compared to latest OSTs I've listened to, this one was ok.\\n\\n\r\nThe art however was something I should've expected from the J.C. staff as (not always) their work has that \"flat\" look to it. The animation can be ok at times but sadly it just didn't make me go \"wow\" nor was it pleasant to my eyes. I was hoping to the animation that was as good as Toradora! but I guess I just wished for just a bit too much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nThe characters.....Do I really must talk about them? Only 5 out of 15 ( with only few of them appearing more than once) where interesting to say the least. Rest felt; flat; boring or just not given enough information about. One of them is Anna's mother who barely appeared on screen, and when she did she acted like that typical villain but without her actually being one. I guess for me, the most interesting character was Gouriki, since he literally looks like gay gorilla. \\n\\n\r\nI must say though, the designs of the characters are at least in a way \"original\". I am using the term \"original\" lightly here because I am talking about their designs, not their personalities. \\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict:\\n\\n\r\nAll together Shimoneta is...an alright anime.\\n\r\nIt is a worth a watch anime, if you aren't disgusted by cringe worthy sexy jokes censored by the anime itself, so go ahead and watch it.\\n\r\nI personally wouldn't watch it myself again\\n\r\nSo much so that I really cannot be asked to finish this review.\\n\r\nThis anime really is a good yet bad anime.\\n\r\nIt has an interesting concept and how it starts\\n\r\nbut as soon as I watched other episodes, I just felt all of it was lost.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, if you want to watch it, do it.\\n\r\nBut I will have to say this anime was...a failure.\\n\\n\r\nThis is IKira-n\\n\r\nsigning out.",

            "content": "Having finished all 12 episodes of Shimoneta, I have to say, this is one of the most pure comedy show I have seen in a long time.  On the surface, Shimoneta is a show about rebelling against a system that banned all dirty jokes.  Under the surface, Shimoneta is a show about rebelling a system that banned all dirty jokes.  In other words it stays true to itself throughout the series, which is rare nowaday since most shows try to teach some nonsensical life lesson.\r\nStory:  First of, this is one of the most ridiculous premise I've ever seen for an ero-comedy.Does that make it less enjoyable? Heck no!.  The story is flexible in a sense that it allows for various type of experimentation, in other words, you can have fun with it.  To describe the plot with minimal spoilers, it's a story about a boy learning to discover his inner erotic-self by teaming up with an erotic terrorist who is also the vice-president on the student council whose goal is to ban all erotic activities.  This is a story about their plans to free society from the grip of the extremes of morality laws that have become too misinformed about humanity's erotic nature.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  The art for Shimoneta is pretty standard, it's nothing too innovative or too surprising.  However, with that said, it is fundamentally sound and the character designs are unique, and erotic (if you can see it).\\n\\n\r\nSound: S-O-X.  Enough said.  That is one awesome OP and ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are the best part of this show for me.  Most of the main characters that are introduced grow and change in their own way throughout the show.  In fact, some characters change so drastically that it adds to the comedic elements of the show.  If there is one thing that makes this show stands out from the rest, it is the characters.  This show is 90% character driven.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  If you are a fan of ero-comedy / do not take a show too seriously, Shimoneta is for you.  Sit back and enjoy the ride.  Don't think too much on it and just have a good laugh.  If you're looking for a deep plot, well you should probably keep looking but then go back and enjoy this show nonetheless.",

            "content": "\"One thing about terrorists... Even if we know we're going to fail, we must still tell dirty jokes!\" - Ayame Kajou\r\n(Ironic note: my 69th review.)\r\nFinally, a self parodying ecchi anime! Why can't there be more of these out there? If the title didn't cue you in, this show is about the most middle school topic you can think of: cheesy sex jokes. The premise is that Japan's government is just a shadow government, taken over 16 years prior run by a bunch of overbearing prudes who seek to stamp out every trace of sexuality and obscenity from society. This group of children who were bornand raised in the culture since the transition have grown up in a world where the Concept of a Dirty Joke Doesn't Exist- and SOX, a \"dirty\" terror organization, rises to the occasion, to spread the good word of the filth.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: 7\\n\\n\r\nFor a show about terrible sex jokes, a large portion of the show is visual gags- and boy do they drop the visual gags in this show. While it'd be impossible to list them all, let it suffice to say that one character is shaped like a dong, and approximately 75% of the backgrounds/scenes and items in every episode consist of innuendo or something outright sexual. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, very solid in fluidity and consistent detail level. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 7\\n\\n\r\nI have to hand it to Miyu Matsuki. She really knocked it out of the park as the painfully ignorant of sexuality, but lustful to a violent degree Anna. You can feel the crazy vibes from here, and I'm 7000 miles away. \\n\r\nAlso major props to Yuusuke Kobayashi- a relative unknown VA in a sea of ladies voicing male characters- playing Okuma. Just the right amount of indignity and protesting to turn Okuma into a sympathetic hero, I mean terrorist. \\n\r\nThe opening and outro songs were written for the show, they're okay, but I ended up skipping them after about three epsiodes. Not really anything I'd ever want to hear again. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nThey say the joke is all about the delivery- and in a comedy show, you have to have a varied cast of weirdos to make the humor work. Thankfully, we're provided a relatable, spunky, hyperactive heroine in the form of Ayame Kajou. Ayame performs her duties as Student Council VP during the day, valiantly upholding the rigid morality standards of the school while moonlighting as the dirty terrorist known as Blue Snow.\\n\r\nShe has a penchant for the most middle school-esque humor of any character I've ever seen, real or animated. She turns literally everything into some really lame, really bad sex pun- just like I did when I was 12, and I loved it. It's not that her character is particularly funny (unless you actually are in middle school), it's more that I was reminded of those days, and how incredibly edgy sexual humor was back then, compared to its relative commonplace status now, as an adult. \\n\\n\r\nMy personal favorite character was probably the feisty shorty Saotome, however. As an impossibly talented artist, she joins SOX as the propaganda chairperson- in charge of creating and distributing lewd materials, which due to constant surveillance by the arm bands and necklaces that everyone is required to wear, became quite difficult, since any lewd drawings done with her hands would get her arrested. So she learns to draw using her mouth, and pops out the most salacious, freaky doujinshi ever created- mostly starring her classmates. She drops some of the best one liners in the show. \\n\\n\r\nI can imagine most viewers of the show would likely pick Anna as the overall best thing in the show- but I disagree. I found her presence more irritating than entertaining. She serves almost entirely to be a plot device whenever Ayame and Okuma run into trouble simply because she's obsessed with Okuma and follows him around, trying to gift him her \"love nectar\". When she gets into these lustful moods (because she has no concept of love vs lust), she gains superhuman strength and agility- which is usually put to use \"cleansing immoral activities\" that the ever pious Kajo and Okuma point her towards. Honestly, if you were to remove Anna and all mention of her from the plot and replace her with any other girl for Okuma to crush on, the show wouldn't have suffered in the slightest. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6 \\n\\n\r\nAs stated above, this near future Japan has instated constant surveillance on the youth of the nation, and any type of publicly lewd act, lewd drawings, objects, speech, or otherwise \"immoral\" behavior is punishable by law. After government raids eradicated the vast majority of porno, dirty magazines, toys, and other sexually related paraphernalia, that which remains is a hidden treasure- one that some, seen as \"Dirty Terrorists\" would seek to use to educate the wider populace and turn public opinion towards sexuality into a more favorable one. This is where SOX comes in. An organization (hardly) consisting initially of solely Ayame Kajo performing petty acts such as public indecency and distribution of lewd materials, it transforms into a serious threat through the course of the show, with discoveries and creation of new dirty materials and education of the irrationally ignorant student populace. \\n\\n\r\nAs it would happen though, SOX is not the only terrorist group whose activities are purely of the sexual nature. Fetishists, and other weirdo characters crop up to try and steal their sexual thunder, but there can be only one. \\n\\n\r\nThe story strokes off strongly at first, but is plagued by a really weak and boring middle. Episodes 7, 8, and 9 are practically filler as they're just setups for the endgame, and episode 5 is just a fetch quest episode. The climax is decent, but as with many anime... the big bad is just a stepping stone to a bigger bad, and with a \"twist\" that everyone saw coming, the effect is pretty weak. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 7 \\n\\n\r\nThe show is absolutely chock full of sophomoric humor, but at the same time, it's rather charming in the delivery. If there was ever an anime that took me back to being in middle school, this was it. I hearkened back to days in public middle school, discovering new combinations of bad words and trying them out on unsuspecting prudes to my endless entertainment. The show definitely has some creatively funny moments, and some lowbrow, tasteless ones too. Only with this kind of show, it at least knows it's crude, takes the balls and fondles them. I mean, runs with it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend?\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a refresher on the seemingly endless stream of ecchi garbage that constitutes the majority of anime in 2015, this one would be a good choice.",

            "content": "Shimoneta is a vastly underrated anime that, almost expectedly, gets poor reviews from the very types of people that it skewers. \r\nIn 2015 we live in a society that is becoming increasingly intolerant to personal expression and freedom of speech and Shimoneta takes this trend and draws it to it's absurd and natural conclusion, demonstrating the oppressive nature of \"Political Correctness\" when it turns into censorship on moral grounds. The dystopian aspect of this show comes from the omnipresent police state that monitors and hence controls whatever it deems to be \"lewd behavior\". Almost hysterically, hardly anyone, including the people enforcing these laws, actually knowwhat \"lewd behavior\" is - leading to a wide assortment of innocent or otherwise innocuous things (such as toilet paper!) being banned for being \"lewd\".\\n\\n\r\nThe entire premise is absurd, but it's meant to be that way in order to bring the points the show is trying to make into stark contrast. Constant themes are - Censorship by the state, repression of natural human urges, regression of human knowledge and art, loss of privacy, thought control and unjust laws. These are incredible themes for an anime, let alone a comedy anime, and Shimoneta tackles them all with aplomb (and tongue firmly in cheek).\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest issues with this anime is that it relies heavily on cultural idioms, slang and puns because most of the humor is innuendo based. This doesn't translate well from Japanese to other languages, so your experience may vary depending on how much you understand these aspects of Japanese culture. That being said, there's still plenty of physical and situational comedy that most people should be able to understand.\\n\\n\r\nShimoneta is a rare anime that challenges the viewer to not only come to grips with their own opinions about lewd or \"ecchi\" behavior and content, but also to think about how just or unjust it is to force your own views on other people.",

            "content": "Hello there. Do you love dirty jokes? I do, who doesn\u2019t? I like my dirty jokes to go beyond the boundaries that many would consider to be the tipping point of how far jokes can go. There is an art to it that can make any of these jokes work when they are done with precision and finesse. Sometimes they are done with subtlety or not subtle in the slightest; both of which can be successful or a failure depending on how they are executed. Shimoneta fits the latter quite accurately to say the least. And when I say not subtle, that is taking itlightly.\\n\\n\r\nSet in a dystopian Tokyo where all shamelessness, lewdness, and dirty language has been outlawed, you can already assume ahead of time that Shimoneta is a satire of political correctness. More specifically, how the conservative government of Japan tries to censor any part of a medium that maybe considered morally indecent to the public in their own eyes. Shimoneta wants to portray how their utopia would become a reality and how it would not work based on how human biology works. In other words, humans are sexual creatures through and through, whether we all want to admit that truth or not. Not only that, but it can also be a satire of how sex education is important in our society and an abstinence only education would prove to be a flawed system.\\n\\n\r\nSo does Shimoneta handle this satire well and make it hilarious in the long run? In short, it succeeds to make it into an entertaining anime with some subtle level of commentary to go by with it. Take, for instance, the character Anna, voiced by the recently passed Miyu Matsuki, who would be the archetype for a person who wants to be a pure person with no perverted characteristics. But because of an accidental kiss by the main character Tanukichi, that triggered a romantic spark into her brain that causes to develop urges that she never knew before. Shimoneta gives a pretty intelligent method of showing us the intricacies of how teenagers go through hormonal phases once they bloom into full-grown sexual young adulthood. It can also be enjoyed just as a silly joke and nothing else as well and Shimoneta obviously characterizes itself as either or just one alternative outlook.\\n\\n\r\nAnother commentary that Shimoneta does exceptionally well is how they portray the dystopian society of conservative political correctness. It does not do it in such a way where it is done in a forceful manner that it becomes preachy as a result. Rather it keeps that theme in the background where it doesn\u2019t seem too apparent for the viewer to be distracted by and doesn\u2019t overshadow the comedy. Shimoneta wants to be a wacky sex comedy through and through with some added commentary mixed in, in order to make it unique from other anime ecchi shows. Even with a rape scene involving a woman licking a guy\u2019s chest out of sexual gratification in a  non-consensual, it still manages to be hilarious and offer an intelligent insight that invertedly challenges our notion of how we can find things of this nature funny from a different set of circumstances. At least that is how I interpreted it.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy pulls so many punches to the viewer that it can be a bit much for the squeamish. But I love it when my ecchi anime pulls no limits to what it can do to either entertain or offend those who turn their nose up at shamelessness of this caliber. Simply put, Shimoneta is the most raunchy, lewd, indecent, and crazy ecchi anime I\u2019ve ever come across, and probably you\u2019ll ever come across. And I mean these with the utmost positive feelings that I could ever muster. Its clever ways of censoring dialogue to make us decipher what the characters are saying with some obvious hints based on context keeps its tone and comedic timing on-point and humorous from beginning to end. Many of its innuendos, whether it be visual or audible, might be forced in some cases but they help create a comedic atmosphere that keeps the show from being tedious and boring. Even some of the jokes that the writers came up took my breath away from how much they are willing to get away with. So much so that I think no other country except Japan would ever allow on television.\\n\\n\r\nNot only does the comedy work with the theme and atmosphere, but it also gives the characters some nice needed charm to make up for their lack of development. Truth be told, the characters are not the most three-dimensional. Most of them have the one characteristic that defines them as a character, whether it be wanting sweet love nectar, obsessed with drawing shameless pictures, or wanting to rid themselves of the purity police controlling people\u2019s language and sex lives. Nevertheless, I found myself slightly forgiving this negative from how much I enjoyed the chemistry between our main hero Tanukichi and main heroine Ayame. Heck, almost all of the characters have wonderful chemistry between one another from the hilarious interactions and dialogues that are clever and done with great comedic timing. One other character worth mentioning is the art prodigy Otome who\u2019s brash and crazy attitude adds so much to the cast thanks to the always hilarious Satomi Arai doing her Kuroko voice from A Certain Scientific Railgun.\\n\\n\r\nI found myself enjoying the creative art designs of the characters from how colorful and expressive they exhibit. There are some areas where I think the art can be a bit too bright and white-washed in some scenes. Overall, technically Shimoneta is a nicely animated show with many comedic gags having a great sense of depth and absurdity despite the fact that it is censored, in an ironic fashion. I would not necessarily call the music a highlight of the show, even though I found myself enjoying the ED with its combination of jazz-influenced horns and J-Pop vocals. The music from the show itself is not very special in the slightest and I found myself not paying much attention to it while watching.\\n\\n\r\nIt is hard for me to reminisce about this show without some fascination about it. I found myself intrigued with the possibility of ecchi anime like Shimoneta existing more often, if this ever becomes a big hit in the future, after watching it. Not just in how balls to the wall it is with its subject matter and jokes, but how it can offer a witty way of implementing a theme that is synonymous with sexual aspects of real life. Ecchi, of course, is here to give us some sexual gratification to hone our skills of being lewd in real life. It feels welcoming to see an anime like Shimoneta to prove that it can be more than that in more ways than one.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-\\n",

Though I'm still not quite sure how this got on TV, expect everything in the ecchi drawing book from panties and upskirts galore to what can only be described as soft core porn with many smiley stickers on the screen.\r\nThe show is about, ironically, an idealized Japan where everything lewd is purged Fahrenheit 451 style; and where everyone is forced to wear braceletstracked by Big Brother. In this world, we find a girl \"terrorist\" who spreads lewd pictures and wears a panty on her head as a mask in the name of celebrating sexuality. Into this comes our protagonist, the son of an erotic terrorist who wants nothing more than to go to school with his idealized figure of purity, Anna. While trying to save another student from being falsely accused of molestation, Tanukichi is targeted by the accuser and saved from the police -er... morality officers- by none other than the girl terrorist. How will this fateful encounter ripple through this innocent Japan? Be warned, this show is not for the faint of heart- proceed only if shows like High School DxD or ImoCho do not faze you.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe show is drawn in a bright color palette with average backgrounds and lighting. The funding seems focused on the ridiculous variety of ecchi in the show. From indecent postcards to sparkling \"love juice\", expect all sorts of soft core attempts to awaken a dude's walrus (they apparently chose that instead of the more typical elephant). In any case, expect this to be one of the most outrageously in-your-face ecchi shows out there. As for character styling, everyone is... unique I guess? All I can say is, not everyone is as pure as they initially seem...\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe puns and dirty jokes continue even into the OP and EDs (some of which \"educate\" the viewer into how to make a \"pleasant\" mold among other things). The OP has an unnecessarily long introduction before launching into a rather old-sounding song, though it's clearly designed for the show. Annoyingly, the main theme is catchy- just make sure no one catches you humming to it in public. The funky ED, if anything, is even more catchy and fitting for the show; note that the lyrics are pretty NSFW. The BGM has many brass instruments, fitting for the ecchi-based theme. However, more noticeable is the virtually endless visual and auditory censoring.\\n\\n\r\nAs for VAs, you have a mix between veterans and relative new actors. On the veteran's side, you have the instantly-recognizable voice of Satomi Arai, and, amazingly, Yui Horie voicing a young brat, whose hair takes the form of a certain mushroom shape when she get's \"energized\". Oh, and if you feel a need to control your bulge when listening to Anna, don't forget that you're listening to the aroused groans of a 38-year-old veteran. Overall, expect a fair performance with a ridiculous amount of screaming and censoring.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nAs alluded to earlier, the show is about a terrorist organization called \"SOX\" and its efforts to spread dirty jokes and, to a more benign degree, sexual education to the general populace. The show successfully pokes fun of the glaring problems when there is no sexual education for children, while also ignoring the ridiculous improbability of such a world existing in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThe show follows a central plotline with a well established pattern of introducing supporting characters before launching into a few arcs each with a small climax, not counting those in your pants. There aren't very many plot twists, and the few that are present are given huge amounts of foreshadowing so that seasoned viewers should be able to pretty much guess their way through the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nThe mood of the show is, for the most part, very light and filled with (as the title implies) dirty jokes and ecchi. The actual plot is rather mild in intensity, and doesn't really make very much progress. The core of this show is the dirty jokes, and if that's not what you're here for you're better off looking elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI ought to echo what I just said above, but for the sake of entertainment, I won't. The characters in this show are not that great, they have barely any exposition and really are all just sexually-curious teenagers, regardless of whether or not they actually state so. I guess both Tanukichi and Anna are dynamic characters, though Anna sort of feels like she's taken directly from a hentai at times. Don't expect much from this category, unless your goal is to see characters in outrageous outfits and circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThough dirty jokes can be a fair tool at appropriate times, this show takes it far, far beyond that. The show with supposedly the highest moral-based setting is ironically one of the most lecherous, non-hentai works out there. Though unique in its approach, I wouldn't be surprised if many people shun its parody; similar to how one could shun 30sai. This show is for those who appreciate ecchi, and can handle it in large quantities. For everyone else, may your eyes find more peaceful sights elsewhere.",

            "content": "Shimoneta is Summer 2015's most prominent ecchi comedy series and has finally concluded its first season. It is very difficult to write an objective review of something as subjective as an ecchi comedy but in the case of Shimoneta it has an advantage that others do not; It has absolutely no plot.\r\nLet's begin; It's a sex-comedy show established as being about a group of Naughty Terrorists that want to spread sex education in a world that suppresses all sexuality similar to what feminism wants to do in the real world but I digress. A totalitarian government exists and does not let people draw or saythings that could be construed as lewd, because of this, people are wildly ignorant about sex and that's where SOX comes in.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is episodic (somewhat) and is about missions undertaken by the members of SOX, it sounds a lot more exciting than it actually is... it is , in reality, a basic framework and backdrop for the real meat and potatoes which is, telling as many dirty jokes as possible. In this reviewer's humble opinion, they don't work, they're forced and are unfunny. \\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters are Kajou Akame (Female lead) and Tanukichi Okuma (Male lead), both are serviceable , if a bit boring... but their actions do have a lot of energy and when they interact it can lead to funny situations. That being said, the situations are often hit-or-miss, mostly miss. But what I can tell you about a comedy anime other than, I didn't find it funny? well, the leads are average at best and most of the supporting cast is weak but.... it has two characters in it which absolutely stole the show.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, Anna Nikishinomiya and Fuwa Hyouka. \\n\r\nTelling you about these characters would be a disservice to them , partially spoiling their charm, but let me tell you that the creators of this show knew that the leads were a bit dull and threw in these two to fill in the quota of comedy, it works, at least for me. \\n\\n\\n\r\nHonestly this is the worst review I have written. There is no story, there is no character development, there is very little in the form of artwork other than the basics so I can't critique it as I would a normal show. All I can tell you is, I would have rated this *VERY* low if not for those two members of the supporting cast I mentioned. They are unique, they are new, they are interesting, the things they do are so mind-jarringly strange that it is truly a treat when they show up.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for sex, this show has none, no actual sex ever takes place.\\n\r\nIf you are looking for fast-paced, sexually suggestive comedy, this will have it.\\n\r\nIf you are looking for an intricate plot and character development, this does NOT have it.\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a diverse, unique, interesting cast of characters, this does NOT have it.\\n\r\nIf you want to see a woman trick a man into eating cookies made with her love juice, this is the show for you.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it, it only just barely.",

            "content": "Lately censorship has become completely unreasonable and an anime tackling this problem sounded promising, but oh how wrong it all went.\r\nLets start with the story.The anime takes place sometime in the future when Japan has banned all things \u201cimmoral\u201d. Our main character Tanukichi Okuma has just transferred to the elite public morals school where he is quickly summoned to join the student council to help fight the terrorist organisation SOX that is fighting against censorship, but he almost immediately gets blackmailed by one of the council members Ayame Kajou, who is actually one of the terrorists, to join the terrorists and commit obscene acts.\r\nWell thewhole concept is not all that bad and could be made perfectly enjoyable, however the sheer amount of unnecessary profanity made the whole thing barely watchable. First off why should every other sentence spoken in the show reference either sex, masturbation or intimate body parts, that might be funny the first few times but after less than ten minutes it started to get old and after the first episode it was just painful. Most of the episodes were abysmal, but the surprising thing is that the ending was quite enjoyable and the anime ended on a positive note so I couldn\u2019t give it an even lower score.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes a bad story can be offset by great characters, but that sure as hell does not apply here. Our main character is one of the blandest out there, he manages to have no defining traits, we know next to nothing about his backstory and even his actions are dictated by someone else most of the time. Are the others any better? Well they are, but they are still poorly developed and completely one dimensional. The members of SOX can\u2019t even speak normally without obnoxious sexual references. The one character who shines is Fuwa, as she manages to be the only one who is not overly annoying with her jokes and is one of the only reasons I managed to sit through this travesty, but unfortunately her screen time is limited. The relationships between characters are as poorly developed as the characters. One relationship stands out the most and that is the one between Okuma and his crush, the student council president Ana. The scenes between these two made me want to puke at times, it was just so wrong and disgusting.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was nothing to write home about, but it still managed to work well enough. Here I want to touch the absolutely retarded way of censoring in the \u201cuncensored\u201d version with stickers that looked like the body part it was covering. I have no idea who thought that it would be fun, but it just came out as immature as the rest of the series. Still that does not mean there was no fan-service as it was plentiful and completely tasteless, why would one want to constantly see bodily fluids of our characters. The soundtrack itself was not bad, but the opening was just awful, the ending was not much better so neither made their way into my iTunes library.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all watching this has been quite the ordeal and it was probably the worse anime I have ever seen, and if it wasn\u2019t for the last few episodes this would have surely gotten a score lower than 3, but considering the ending was not even bad it just manages to scrape up a score of 5 out of 10. Do I recommend this to anyone? To be frank no, I do not think it is worth your time as there are so many better shows out there. In the end it was sad that I found an anime that fights against censorship, to be one of the best examples why some form of censorship is sometimes needed.\\n\r\nI really hope you enjoyed reading the review and I kindly ask you to leave some feedback so I can improve my writing.

            "content": "\"Pornography does not create perversions, it merely arouses a pervert's imagination.\" \r\n   Shimoneta is the kind of anime that not everyone will like or enjoy by any means (obviously) as it is.. well.. crude as hell. It is intended for people who like shameless sexual humor, and that is it's target audience. Now my reason for giving it the score that I did is based mostly on my enjoyment of the series and it's over the top nature rather than it's plot and characters which are pretty average as far as anime goes. Now lets get into the meaty details.\r\n   Story:6 - This is a series that by no means should be taken seriously. It is not the kind of anime that you go into for a complex or compelling narrative. Now, I think that the scenario given to us is better than most others in that it takes place in an alternate Japan where anything deemed \"immoral\" by it's government was banned and deemed illegal. This is possibly commentary on how Japan already censor's much of it's sexual content already, except here taken to the extreme obviously.\\n\r\n   The main plot revolves around a male student attending a new high-school (like we haven't seen this before) before he gets himself wrapped up in a terrorist organization run by another high-school student who goes by the code-name \"Blue Snow\" whose plan is to rid japan of the oppressive censorship and to return everything to as it once was. \\n\r\n  Pretty standard stuff really, although don't expect a lot of plot progression or deep twists here, really the bulk of the show lies in it's gags and situational humor.\\n\\n\r\n  Art: 8 - Nothing to say as far as art goes, it stays pretty consistent and I never really found myself groaning at any flaws as far as character design or animation goes. \\n\\n\r\n  Sound: 7 - Same goes for sound. I like both the intro and the outro themes very much, and everything else as far as sound design goes is pretty run of the mill and nothing special. \\n\\n\r\n  Character: 6 - Unfortunately as far as characters go in Shimoneta, they're as you expect for this kind of genre. Most of the side characters have really only one personality trait and are very one-dimensional. Now by no means do I  expect incredibly deep and compelling characters in an anime where the main gag is about f*cking, but I at least want something a little bit better than what we keep getting is all. Not all characters are like this fortunately, as I found  Ayame (Blue Snow) pretty enjoyable as well as a few others I can't mention because spoilers. I don't HATE what was done here, but I do want to see a bit more personality out of more of the cast rather than just the few that do.\\n\\n\r\n  Enjoyment: 7 - I have to admit, I really enjoyed watching this. Even with all of it's flaws I still found myself wanting to watch the next episode just to see what ridiculous sh*t would happen next. The jokes aren't anything smart or intelligent by any means, and I'm ok with that. Shimoneta is something that you turn your brain off and just enjoy, nothing more and nothing less than mindless entertainment in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\n  Overall: 7/10 - As I said before, this isn't for everyone. If you are a fan of over the top crude adult humor than this is the anime for you. But for everyone else, I say give it a shot...  but don't go in with high expectations.\\n\\n",

Picturing groups of young ones running around re-educating the Japanese in the ways of the pervent makes me chuckle inside. \r\nThe problem is that this greater story is rarely touched up. Many of the 12 episodes are based on recruitment. Others are on interpersonal relationships, but other than a passing mention, the plot at large goes both unexplored and unremembered, as well as unresolved.\r\nThis is an anime with great artwork that -could- have been much much more. There is some obvious creative thought thatwent into some of the cast of characters, but oddly enough, it's the main two protagonists (if you can call a terrorist a protagonist), that are the least fleshed out. Both are bland and uninspired, in contrast to the rest of the crew.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development and identity exist though, in splotches. The characters that were thought out are great. Almost every scene with Fuwa, a creepy scientist on the verge of understanding reproduction between humans,  is hilarious. Gouriki, a large man who doesn't know he's gay because the term doesn't exist anymore, is funny to watch. Anna has great lines and colors, hilarious action, and a strong if sudden change of heart that changes the theme of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs a comedy, it works. Anything else is beyond the show, which is greater than the sum of it's parts. \\n\\n",

Basically this show is one of that anime series that you cant watch with your family unless they are really open minded because the jokes are dirty and thats what the anime want to show. \r\nThe story starts with a boy (Okuma) who finally is aproved to a great school, but the problem is the school is one of the most rigid when it comes about morals. The context of the plot is that in Japan is prohibited to use dirtywords like p*nis, v*gina, and etc. Students even dont know how sex is made and how people have babies. \\n\\n\r\nSo a terrorist called Setsugen no Ao appears with a pantsu on her head and trow pictures of nudity in the street. I'm not gonna tell the story here because if you want to know you need to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great, its very similar to the novel, the characters are so funny, speciially Setsugen no Ao. Theres a girl with a hair like a p*nis head, a scientist student that have no emotions and keep following the protagonist asking him how babies are made, Anna whos the president of the moral concil on the school the protagonist just arrived, and later on reveals herself a \"crazy\" person.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is 10, outstanding because the songs are funny just like the anime and the seyus are great. Setsugen no Ao is voiced by the ones who was the voice for Shiodome Akira from Naga no Asukara and Okuma was voiced by the same man who made the protagonist from Witch craft works, both great animes.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a masterpiece for those who wants to just see dirty jokes and funny characters. This isnt for that moments when you want some deep plot about time travel like Steins;gate, or a complex world context like Shinsekai yori. This anime series is SIMPLE but that what makes it so great.\\n\r\nFor the reviews above, you should watch at least more than 200 anime series to tell something. Watching Naruto, One Piece, Bleach only doesnt give you the rights to deeply analyze animes like this.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are searching for a great with dirty conversations anime series THIS IS THE MASTERPIECE show you are looking for.\\n\\n\\n\r\nA WORLD WITHOUT DIRTY JOKES IS BORING!!!\\n\\n\r\nSETSUGEN NO AO, AISHITEIRU!!!!",

I've watched this anime with a friend through the whole thing and I don't regret watching this anime.\r\nThe anime is one of the ecchiest anime (Aki-sora is another thing) and one of the funniest. The OP is really funny and its one of the ecchiest anime OP to, but this anime was really enjoyable and I really don't regret watching this, but the best thing is that I watched it with myfriend and we had fun with this anime. The anime is also kind of weird. It contains action aswell and its one of the best ecchi action (nothing beats DXD). But the best thing is one character in this anime (Its a female), she is one of the characters that will get you to laugh and think \"I want to leave this anime XD\".\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is for people that like Ecchi, bad language and comedy.\\n\\n\r\n(This anime is the best of the ecchiest (Dxd is better) and its really ecchi with a bad language.\\n\\n\r\nHope you found this helpful.",

But boy I was so wrong.\r\nThis is a piece of art when it comes to comedy. I truly am unable to remember when I laughed so much while watching an anime or a TV series.\r\nAnyway now let's break it down in categories.\r\n-Story: 8-\r\nThe story of this is well...just good. The action takes part 16 years after almost any trace of pornographyis destroyed and it became illegal to use any bad words. In schools kids were taught to be totally sexually oblivious until Blue Snow , a female terrorist destroys the peace.\\n\\n\r\n-Art: 10-\\n\r\nI'm not exactly an artist so I can just say the art is extremely good, just like in most animes in the last 2 years.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound: 10-\\n\r\nThe sound fx in this anime is worth more than 10.It is hilariously good. From the theme songs that are just as funny as the jokes in the anime to the verbal puns that make you die of laughter.\\n\\n\r\n-Character: 9-\\n\r\nWell all the characters seem pretty well designed and all add to the hilarity either with their obliviousness to sexual matters or their exaggerated passion for them.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment: 9-\\n\r\nI can say that I really loved it and I am thankful I watched it.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall: 9-\\n\r\nAs long as you look at it from a strictly comedic point of view you can say this truly deserves its score.",

            "content": "\"What's the point of dirty jokes anyway if they aren't 'wrong'? They're appealing *because* they are wrong. They excite us *because* we have to be secretive. Because they're devilish, they shine. Because they're twisted, they entice us. That is why I vowed to become the 'devil' to crush this boring world where the concept of dirty jokes does not exist!\" \u2013 Kajou Ayame\r\nAt first glance this may sound like a pretty stupid quote, but when you think about it there's a lot of truth behind it. In fact, Shimoneta as a whole functions in more or less the same way as underneath the hyperactive, wackycomedy there are a lot of shots fired not only against many societal norms, but also the censorship laws of Japanese media.\\n\\n\r\nFirst thing first though: let's be honest here, how many people actually thought this was going to be a good anime before this season started airing? My guess is not so many, but Shimoneta came roaring seemingly completely out of nowhere and proved itself as one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen in anime, but also one of the strangest ones. The setting is honestly pretty similar to 1984 of all things, as it features a totalitarian, dystopian society with heavy governmental censorship. In this case however, the censorship is solely about sexual content. In fact all forms of pornography, sexual education, or anything along those lines has been completely banned from society for the last decade, and every citizen is forced to wear a vocal monitor at all times which summons the police to arrest them should they ever say a dirty word. Enter Kajou Ayame, a.k.a. the lewd terrorist \u201cBlue Snow\", a self-proclaimed freedom fighter who distributes sexual material wherever she goes in an attempt to educate people. Alongside our unfortunate protagonist Okuma Tanukichi whom she blackmails into assisting her, the two of them initiate a campaign of obscenities against the government with the hopes of one day managing to reform society to what it once was.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on for days talking about the utter lunacy of Shimoneta, but I'd rather just recommend you to experience it for yourself as there is no way you can properly express its sheer absurdness with mere words. All I'll say is that it although it is fairly uneven, when it peaks it's without a doubt one of the best comedies ever.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is definitely worth talking about though is the underlying message that the show is very clearly trying to send. After all, in a nutshell the entire story is essentially about fighting against the government's violation of freedom of speech and getting rid of all forms of censorship throughout society. It doesn't exactly take a genius to figure out what the author is trying to say with that. I'm pretty sure most people who watch anime on a regular basis are very familiar with just how severe the censorship can be for it. Whether it's about gore, sexual themes or anything else, there are always tons of things that have to be left out. Not only does this hinder the authors' and illustrators' ability to express themselves properly, but it can also severely neuter the experience for the series' viewers. And really, in this day and age even a kid can access essentially anything via the internet, so it's not like you're actually \u201cprotecting\" anyone from graphical content by blocking it out anyway, not to mention that if someone didn't want to see that kind of stuff they wouldn't be watching the anime in question in the first place, censored or not. Shimoneta feels a lot like an author who had gotten fed up with the current system and who decided to write this story out of spite. Whether or not that is actually the case I do not know, but the fact that there are a lot of political messages in this story is undeniable. Although if it's really true that the author came up with the idea for Shimoneta when he was drunk like he claims to, then that only makes the whole thing even more peculiar.\\n\\n\r\nEither way, regardless of whether you're watching this anime for the absurd comedy or the underlying messages, Shimoneta does a great job at both. It stands out as one of the most positively surprising anime I have seen in an extremely long time, and it will be remembered for being both hilarious and thought-provoking at the same time. Not many series can boast with that achievement.\\n\\n\r\nNow sadly I don't really think the awareness that Shimoneta might raise will be enough to do anything about the censorship laws in Japan, but at least it stands up for itself and dares to make a statement. It's a step in the right direction at the very least, and I can only hope that more series will have the guts to do the same in the future.",

            "content": "\"Nothing is disgusting....nothing\" - Okuma, episode 12\r\nShimoneta and Prison School have got to be the dirtiest and lewd shows this season, or this year. But Shimoneta sucks and Prison School is far superior. Why do I say this about two shows that are about on par in sexual content? Well then, read the review.\r\nShimoneta's premise is that all that is lewd and sexual has been banned for over a decade, and any use of sexual things via words, or objects will get you into legal trouble. Now our 'heroes' are off to fight a war and take back the justice which is all that iserotic that Japan is in dire need of. I hate this show not because it has ass and titties and panties...and other sex stuff, it's because of the characters poorly delivered dialogue, development, and just plain character. The story has no connected ideas, it's goes from point A to Point C, D, and B. Our cast is going around spreading erotic pictures and magazines to spread knowledge of the ignorance the country is in. The end of the series doesn't resolve anything really. There is this supposed huge conflict against the government baddies that's hardly ever explored, and the other terrorist organizations who are barely mentioned or shown for 2 seconds. The idea of the show is good, it's loosely reflected upon Japan's lack of sexual interaction among the young people with the declining Japanese population. But just because the idea behind the story is good, doesn't mean the execution is the same.\\n\\n\r\nShimoneta prizes itself with its pathetic characters who have no range nor substance. There is a complete lack of immersion and characterization. Okuma is every FUCKING reluctant brown hair male archetype, who is so plain and unoriginal, he has no quality to him. Any of the four boys from Prison School would've made a better protagonist. While Okuma is a terrible main character, Kajou has it worse. A character with substantial motivation and promise only to be hindered by her vastly pointless use of dialogue to spout unnecessary lewd words for the sake of it. You can't go one fucking sentence without her saying dick, just because. \"Oh but it's the point of the show\".......no, that shit is just bad writing. There are times where her lewd talk is appropriate in the situation but that's already when you're tired of her speaking. Additionally, Kajou's characterization and development is nonexistent. Actually, no character in the show has development, at all. Essentially, what we get is a plot that achieves nothing substantial enough to justify the span of 12 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nDialogue in general is terrible, TURRIBLE. It is unashamedly cheesy, while it should be ashamed, for how immature it handles immature use of sexual content. And it fails miserably. The comedy is just more dick and pussy jokes that get tiring really fast. Even for someone, myself, does the same thing, I don't expect that kind of amateur writing in entertainment. Other characters such as Anna is completely defiled as a one dimensional sex obsessed freak in the most annoying way possible. She's not Sarutobe Ayume from Gintama who actually is far better and actually funny, being obsessed with Gintoki just as much, just not as lewd and disgusting (nothing is disgusting). Even Tsukimigusa who has a sort of might not be interesting back story to him, it's totally under utilized. The only real character I enjoyed was White Peak. Somehow he didn't bother me, he was actually the epitome of what this show could've been. I loved every moment of his character, and then he's gone, forever. Sad times it is.\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing bad to say about the art, it's fine. Subjective? I guess, whatever. I suppose you could say the sound in the show is good. Voice acting is well done and it sort of conveys the characters and setting until the characterization of the characters ruins it.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a bile of sticky white love nectar, earning itself a 3/10. It's a dick of show that can shove itself up it's own ass. Get it?! AHAHAHAHA...it's not funny. This show killed what potential that could be sexual humor in the next stage of evolution. But I think that statement is a far stretch. This show is off the charts of shows I can recommend and earns my shitty of shit face seal of approval.",

            "content": "Every season, there\u2019s usually one or a few series that you can\u2019t watch with your family like your little brother/sister or parents. Keep that in mind if you plan to watch this show.\r\nNow imagine this: \r\nA world where anything lewd, obscene, or considered \u201csexual\u201d is banned. And any attempts to practice such acts of obscenity can land you into jail. In Shimoseka, that\u2019s actually a reality. The government has apparently imposed their laws onto the public to obstruct any sort of obscene behavior. This also apparently includes sex education so children can forget about learning the logics of pregnancy, sexual abstinence, and all that otherstuff they teach you at school. At the center of the story, we have this young man named Tanukichi Okuma. His initial goal was to find Anna Nishikinomiya, a girl that he has admired and has a crush on. Apparently, luck strikes and he not only manages to find her as part of the Student Council but also gets close to Anna like a twist of fate. Unfortunately, this also puts Okuma in a complicated story when he gets involved with Blue Snow, a terrorist who seeks to abolish censorship laws. After reading all of this, you\u2019ll probably thinking...what the hell?\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s what I had thought at first anyways.\\n\\n\r\nThe show isn\u2019t shy on portraying its sexual themes. Its first few episodes easily establishes that committing lewd behavior is considered a capital crime. An example would be Okuma being hunted down by a group of public officers after being accused for obstructing justice with a \u201clewd act\u201d. Despite lacking evidence, he is targeted anyways until he is saved by Blue Snow. The series also isn\u2019t afraid to go far with its sex jokes such as heavily implied references that shows intercourse between flies. Blue Snow is also considered an infamous figure in their world with that signature panty on her head. In fact, there\u2019s little normal about anything regarding this show. Even Anna, the girl he admires the most, awakens her \u201cwild\u201d side while we learn how over exaggerated the government tries to impose its laws on the citizens. So in other words, it sort of makes Okuma the only normal character in the series. \\n\\n\r\nI would say Shimoseka is portrayed as more of a satire rather than anything to be taken as deep or serious. The way the government enforces its laws is similar to Big Brother from 1984. They are the eyes and are always watching you with their cameras, agents, and even \u201cpeace makers\u201d which are apparently devices that monitors\u2019 a person\u2019s movements. If anything is done that is considered lascivious, you can guess what happens next. A show like this can seem to be over the top and offensive at times. There is also rape jokes that is satired by cartoonish censors and fan disservice. Every episode also pushes forward SOX (a parody of censorship for the word, sex) with their goal that becomes more extreme as the story progresses. Blue Snow, also known as Ayame Kajou, is the complete antithesis of what Japanese authorities are trying to enforce. She wears a panty over her head, throws lewd pictures in public, and wears an obscene outfit with little clothing underneath her white cloak. Other characters also becomes a joke itself with their personalities. Example such as Otome with her artistically talent in drawing lewd artwork, Hyouka Fuwa with her fascination in studying the human body and sex behavior, or Kosuri\u2019s manipulative personality as a child. Okuma himself isn\u2019t immune to lewd acts in the show. Time after time, it\u2019s shown that he may secretly enjoy what Anna is doing with him. So in essence, every main character in the show becomes part of the formula. To say that a boring world where dirty jokes doesn\u2019t exist is an overstatement. Dirty jokes weren\u2019t invented in this series. They perfected it.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, the show\u2019s comedy is crude on most parts. The story itself is mostly nonsense and considered a satire. Story arcs that involves terrorists or assaults are supposed to be taken as parodies although recurring tropes can quickly grow old. None of the characters get any sort of depth because the series is more focused on abolishing censorship rather than character growth. However, I will say that the characters\u2019 roles can be quite entertaining to watch especially with how complicated some events can be. But when it all comes down to it, Shimoseka is a dirty joke of itself. It\u2019s fun to watch for some comedy such as Anna\u2019s batshit insane moments or public officials freaking out over the tiniest of lewd acts. If you\u2019ve seen Seitokai Yakuindomo or something similar, then it\u2019s easy to understand the intentions behind the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork for the series is pretty standard by J.C. Staff. Character designs for students are normal although when the story kicks in, everything becomes over the top. Censorship is played out as a joke with the cartoony drawings during inappropriate timings. Even certain words are blocked out as the show is seemingly self-aware of its premise. But as a show about dirty jokes, we do have quite a bit of ecchi moments ranging from Anna\u2019s intense expression of her love towards Okuma or some of the character designs for Blue Snow. There\u2019s also some mature content that is downsized by the satire involving sexual fluids and whatnot. The OP and ED theme song kind of go two folds. For one, it clearly satires the sexualization of the show. On the other hand, it\u2019s also portrayed as upfront for fan service and nothing more. Most of the soundtrack is mediocre and easily forgettable. However, the character voice mannerism is easily recognizable such as Anna\u2019s obscene moments or Blue Snow\u2019s signature laughs. \\n\\n\r\nSome people are probably wondering \u201cwhere were you when this hidden gem premiered?\u201d Oh yeah, this is one of those series that looks, seems, and is funny at first. But over time, it can grow old, and not to mention offensive at times. Still, I will give a vibrant effort in the series for putting a sheer amount of effort in satirizing many of its ideas. Most of the time, fan service is portrayed as mindless and boring. But in this series, it\u2019s played out more as a dirty joke like it should be. Now close your windows, lock your doors, and hope the neighbors don\u2019t wake up when you watch this. \\n",

            "content": "Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai was without a doubt one of the most unique comedy shows I watched and enjoyed during Summer 2015. It was full of energy and excitement, and most importantly a awesome and very memorable cast of characters. \r\nThere are lots of shows that have the dirty jokes in school setting however, Shimoseka's version of this differs greatly. Most noticeable it's more childish and immature with dialogue but the characters discuss mature content... however the once you get used to the character.. (mostly Ayame Kajo's) personality it really starts to grow on you. I noticed it's material,or humor if you will, is also like watching a western cartoon like South park... to a certain extent of course. The dirty jokes and foul language are what the show is about so I do not want to complain too much about that. \\n\\n\r\nI personally felt that the story was again, unique and pretty good. You will pretty much get an idea of what it's about by reading the description so I shouldn't really have to explain... that aside what I liked about the story was it was consistent. What I mean by that is ordinarily shows similar to Shimoseka...  or focuses on too many things which in time makes the story bad. Where as in Shimoneta it focuses on one thing but with many goals, Like hiding dirty magazines in school, obtaining erotic items, etc.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and character designs with the artwork I really appreciated seeing the cyber punk/futuristic setting and atmosphere that the show had. I noticed that lately there seems to be a larger increase of futuristic devices and technologies in anime's so shimoseka's wasn't really special, although I love the ideas of the PM's lol things were so bad... \\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs were something special too.. of all of the characters introduced designs that stood out most were Anna, mostly because of the artist unique choice of colours for her eyes, eyelashes, and hair. Lastly is of course is Ayame Kajo, whose school attire makes her look plain and geeky however when she transitions to her \"normal\" dirty joke loving self her appearance is much more loving. The rest are pretty good too.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and BGM was alright... nothing too special. Music in the show sounded like pretty generic pieces put together to match the shows rhythm and situations. For example I noticed that if there was a very sexual situation going on faster and intense music would play to match the scene. As I mention before the show and the characters are full of energy... (expect for Fuwa.... those bags under her eyes tell it all.)\\n\\n\r\nMy overall enjoyment with this series was pretty high. I found myself highly engaged, and sometimes annoyed with the problematic situations that occurred during my time watching it. Again, the energy the characters have and the fast pacing of the shows events make it really enjoyable so if you decide to watch it expect wild... no SUPER WILD moments or events... things get really crazy.\\n\\n\r\nMy final thoughts are this, if you aren't interested in Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai then you can skip it, overall I would say that it isn't an anime that is worth sharing or recommending. I mean unless you're in a conversation with your friends or best mates about dirty comedies then be my guest. My overall score for it was 8/10 for being highly energetic, wonderful cast of characters, and in it's own unique  way creative. I'm also look forward to reading the last LN being released this year... so that too.\\n",

Just to warn you about the fucked up shits this anime may have. So ye, WATCH AT YOUR OWN RISK!\r\nNow that we have that stuff out of the way, let's start.\r\nHEY! Have you ever thought \"oh wow! Love To Ru's ecchi-ness would be great for a storyline that involves world were there islack of dirty jokes as well as teenagers who rebel against the law and use them 24/7!\" ?\\n\r\nYe, neither did I. However, these guys at J.C. Staff (same guys that created Toradora!, Accel world, Karin, Zero no Tsukaima and more) thought that exact thing and created \"Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai\" or just Shimoneta.\\n\\n\r\nNow since this is a review, let's get into this.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nWhat? There is such a thing at \"story\" in this anime? Holy fuck how did I not notice it?\\n\\n\r\nHold on.\\n\r\nlet me just- get some basic info about that...\\n\\n\r\nOK HERE WE GO\\n\r\nA story about a boy who lives in a world which has forbidden the uses of dirt words or anything to do with explicit sexual contents. After he left to join the Tokioka Academy, on his very first day he met a girl called \"Blue snow\", a girl with white panties on her face and nothing but white sheet over her body, who was known as the terrorist who broke all the laws just because she said some random dirty words in public (yeah I don't know either). Oh yeah, the boys name is Tanukichi Okuma, little mister innocent who joined the most cleanest school (seriously no one in that school knows about sex or how it works) just to follow the girl who was the only friend back then, known as Anna Nishikinomiya; the president of the Student Council and a daughter to her influential parents, whom are both responsible in enforcing the ever stricter public morality laws. (Did I mentioned he hated his father?) But of course, he got caught up in the action by meeting Ayame Kajou, a second year high school student at Tokioka Academy and also the Vice President of the school's student council, and eventually was forced to join her or else she would give him up to police (that poor fucker.) While the series go on, we are almost always greeted by the great and amazing narrator that honestly just annoyed me every time.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, as you can see the \"story\" itself doesn't sound too appealing, except...it does. The fact that they live in a world where no one even knows basic things like what a fucking sex is sounds weird, yet interesting. It can be a very weird anime to follow, especially when the shit hits the fan in ep 4 but it is still a very unique and crazy as fuck anime.\\n\\n\r\nVisuals/sound track: \\n\r\nThis is something I am not so happy to talk about. The OST of this series has the mixture of \"yeah its cool\" and \"what the actual fuck is this?\" which, depending on your view, can mean that the OST is shit, ok, or good. The opening is something that got stuck in my brain, its weird; funny; catchy and just plain \"wtf\"? Which is a type of music I sometimes do listen to (yeah, judge all you want). The same can be said to the Ending, though I must say the ending was more catchy than opening. The rest of the sound track can at times.....just....plain. Nothing really amazing but also not something shit. It can be at times but compared to latest OSTs I've listened to, this one was ok.\\n\\n\r\nThe art however was something I should've expected from the J.C. staff as (not always) their work has that \"flat\" look to it. The animation can be ok at times but sadly it just didn't make me go \"wow\" nor was it pleasant to my eyes. I was hoping to the animation that was as good as Toradora! but I guess I just wished for just a bit too much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nThe characters.....Do I really must talk about them? Only 5 out of 15 ( with only few of them appearing more than once) where interesting to say the least. Rest felt; flat; boring or just not given enough information about. One of them is Anna's mother who barely appeared on screen, and when she did she acted like that typical villain but without her actually being one. I guess for me, the most interesting character was Gouriki, since he literally looks like gay gorilla. \\n\\n\r\nI must say though, the designs of the characters are at least in a way \"original\". I am using the term \"original\" lightly here because I am talking about their designs, not their personalities. \\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict:\\n\\n\r\nAll together Shimoneta is...an alright anime.\\n\r\nIt is a worth a watch anime, if you aren't disgusted by cringe worthy sexy jokes censored by the anime itself, so go ahead and watch it.\\n\r\nI personally wouldn't watch it myself again\\n\r\nSo much so that I really cannot be asked to finish this review.\\n\r\nThis anime really is a good yet bad anime.\\n\r\nIt has an interesting concept and how it starts\\n\r\nbut as soon as I watched other episodes, I just felt all of it was lost.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, if you want to watch it, do it.\\n\r\nBut I will have to say this anime was...a failure.\\n\\n\r\nThis is IKira-n\\n\r\nsigning out.",

            "content": "Having finished all 12 episodes of Shimoneta, I have to say, this is one of the most pure comedy show I have seen in a long time.  On the surface, Shimoneta is a show about rebelling against a system that banned all dirty jokes.  Under the surface, Shimoneta is a show about rebelling a system that banned all dirty jokes.  In other words it stays true to itself throughout the series, which is rare nowaday since most shows try to teach some nonsensical life lesson.\r\nStory:  First of, this is one of the most ridiculous premise I've ever seen for an ero-comedy.Does that make it less enjoyable? Heck no!.  The story is flexible in a sense that it allows for various type of experimentation, in other words, you can have fun with it.  To describe the plot with minimal spoilers, it's a story about a boy learning to discover his inner erotic-self by teaming up with an erotic terrorist who is also the vice-president on the student council whose goal is to ban all erotic activities.  This is a story about their plans to free society from the grip of the extremes of morality laws that have become too misinformed about humanity's erotic nature.\\n\\n\r\nArt:  The art for Shimoneta is pretty standard, it's nothing too innovative or too surprising.  However, with that said, it is fundamentally sound and the character designs are unique, and erotic (if you can see it).\\n\\n\r\nSound: S-O-X.  Enough said.  That is one awesome OP and ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are the best part of this show for me.  Most of the main characters that are introduced grow and change in their own way throughout the show.  In fact, some characters change so drastically that it adds to the comedic elements of the show.  If there is one thing that makes this show stands out from the rest, it is the characters.  This show is 90% character driven.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  If you are a fan of ero-comedy / do not take a show too seriously, Shimoneta is for you.  Sit back and enjoy the ride.  Don't think too much on it and just have a good laugh.  If you're looking for a deep plot, well you should probably keep looking but then go back and enjoy this show nonetheless.",

            "content": "\"One thing about terrorists... Even if we know we're going to fail, we must still tell dirty jokes!\" - Ayame Kajou\r\n(Ironic note: my 69th review.)\r\nFinally, a self parodying ecchi anime! Why can't there be more of these out there? If the title didn't cue you in, this show is about the most middle school topic you can think of: cheesy sex jokes. The premise is that Japan's government is just a shadow government, taken over 16 years prior run by a bunch of overbearing prudes who seek to stamp out every trace of sexuality and obscenity from society. This group of children who were bornand raised in the culture since the transition have grown up in a world where the Concept of a Dirty Joke Doesn't Exist- and SOX, a \"dirty\" terror organization, rises to the occasion, to spread the good word of the filth.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArtwork and Animation: 7\\n\\n\r\nFor a show about terrible sex jokes, a large portion of the show is visual gags- and boy do they drop the visual gags in this show. While it'd be impossible to list them all, let it suffice to say that one character is shaped like a dong, and approximately 75% of the backgrounds/scenes and items in every episode consist of innuendo or something outright sexual. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise, very solid in fluidity and consistent detail level. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Voice Acting: 7\\n\\n\r\nI have to hand it to Miyu Matsuki. She really knocked it out of the park as the painfully ignorant of sexuality, but lustful to a violent degree Anna. You can feel the crazy vibes from here, and I'm 7000 miles away. \\n\r\nAlso major props to Yuusuke Kobayashi- a relative unknown VA in a sea of ladies voicing male characters- playing Okuma. Just the right amount of indignity and protesting to turn Okuma into a sympathetic hero, I mean terrorist. \\n\r\nThe opening and outro songs were written for the show, they're okay, but I ended up skipping them after about three epsiodes. Not really anything I'd ever want to hear again. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nThey say the joke is all about the delivery- and in a comedy show, you have to have a varied cast of weirdos to make the humor work. Thankfully, we're provided a relatable, spunky, hyperactive heroine in the form of Ayame Kajou. Ayame performs her duties as Student Council VP during the day, valiantly upholding the rigid morality standards of the school while moonlighting as the dirty terrorist known as Blue Snow.\\n\r\nShe has a penchant for the most middle school-esque humor of any character I've ever seen, real or animated. She turns literally everything into some really lame, really bad sex pun- just like I did when I was 12, and I loved it. It's not that her character is particularly funny (unless you actually are in middle school), it's more that I was reminded of those days, and how incredibly edgy sexual humor was back then, compared to its relative commonplace status now, as an adult. \\n\\n\r\nMy personal favorite character was probably the feisty shorty Saotome, however. As an impossibly talented artist, she joins SOX as the propaganda chairperson- in charge of creating and distributing lewd materials, which due to constant surveillance by the arm bands and necklaces that everyone is required to wear, became quite difficult, since any lewd drawings done with her hands would get her arrested. So she learns to draw using her mouth, and pops out the most salacious, freaky doujinshi ever created- mostly starring her classmates. She drops some of the best one liners in the show. \\n\\n\r\nI can imagine most viewers of the show would likely pick Anna as the overall best thing in the show- but I disagree. I found her presence more irritating than entertaining. She serves almost entirely to be a plot device whenever Ayame and Okuma run into trouble simply because she's obsessed with Okuma and follows him around, trying to gift him her \"love nectar\". When she gets into these lustful moods (because she has no concept of love vs lust), she gains superhuman strength and agility- which is usually put to use \"cleansing immoral activities\" that the ever pious Kajo and Okuma point her towards. Honestly, if you were to remove Anna and all mention of her from the plot and replace her with any other girl for Okuma to crush on, the show wouldn't have suffered in the slightest. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6 \\n\\n\r\nAs stated above, this near future Japan has instated constant surveillance on the youth of the nation, and any type of publicly lewd act, lewd drawings, objects, speech, or otherwise \"immoral\" behavior is punishable by law. After government raids eradicated the vast majority of porno, dirty magazines, toys, and other sexually related paraphernalia, that which remains is a hidden treasure- one that some, seen as \"Dirty Terrorists\" would seek to use to educate the wider populace and turn public opinion towards sexuality into a more favorable one. This is where SOX comes in. An organization (hardly) consisting initially of solely Ayame Kajo performing petty acts such as public indecency and distribution of lewd materials, it transforms into a serious threat through the course of the show, with discoveries and creation of new dirty materials and education of the irrationally ignorant student populace. \\n\\n\r\nAs it would happen though, SOX is not the only terrorist group whose activities are purely of the sexual nature. Fetishists, and other weirdo characters crop up to try and steal their sexual thunder, but there can be only one. \\n\\n\r\nThe story strokes off strongly at first, but is plagued by a really weak and boring middle. Episodes 7, 8, and 9 are practically filler as they're just setups for the endgame, and episode 5 is just a fetch quest episode. The climax is decent, but as with many anime... the big bad is just a stepping stone to a bigger bad, and with a \"twist\" that everyone saw coming, the effect is pretty weak. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 7 \\n\\n\r\nThe show is absolutely chock full of sophomoric humor, but at the same time, it's rather charming in the delivery. If there was ever an anime that took me back to being in middle school, this was it. I hearkened back to days in public middle school, discovering new combinations of bad words and trying them out on unsuspecting prudes to my endless entertainment. The show definitely has some creatively funny moments, and some lowbrow, tasteless ones too. Only with this kind of show, it at least knows it's crude, takes the balls and fondles them. I mean, runs with it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nRecommend?\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a refresher on the seemingly endless stream of ecchi garbage that constitutes the majority of anime in 2015, this one would be a good choice.",

            "content": "Shimoneta is a vastly underrated anime that, almost expectedly, gets poor reviews from the very types of people that it skewers. \r\nIn 2015 we live in a society that is becoming increasingly intolerant to personal expression and freedom of speech and Shimoneta takes this trend and draws it to it's absurd and natural conclusion, demonstrating the oppressive nature of \"Political Correctness\" when it turns into censorship on moral grounds. The dystopian aspect of this show comes from the omnipresent police state that monitors and hence controls whatever it deems to be \"lewd behavior\". Almost hysterically, hardly anyone, including the people enforcing these laws, actually knowwhat \"lewd behavior\" is - leading to a wide assortment of innocent or otherwise innocuous things (such as toilet paper!) being banned for being \"lewd\".\\n\\n\r\nThe entire premise is absurd, but it's meant to be that way in order to bring the points the show is trying to make into stark contrast. Constant themes are - Censorship by the state, repression of natural human urges, regression of human knowledge and art, loss of privacy, thought control and unjust laws. These are incredible themes for an anime, let alone a comedy anime, and Shimoneta tackles them all with aplomb (and tongue firmly in cheek).\\n\\n\r\nOne of the biggest issues with this anime is that it relies heavily on cultural idioms, slang and puns because most of the humor is innuendo based. This doesn't translate well from Japanese to other languages, so your experience may vary depending on how much you understand these aspects of Japanese culture. That being said, there's still plenty of physical and situational comedy that most people should be able to understand.\\n\\n\r\nShimoneta is a rare anime that challenges the viewer to not only come to grips with their own opinions about lewd or \"ecchi\" behavior and content, but also to think about how just or unjust it is to force your own views on other people.",

            "content": "Hello there. Do you love dirty jokes? I do, who doesn\u2019t? I like my dirty jokes to go beyond the boundaries that many would consider to be the tipping point of how far jokes can go. There is an art to it that can make any of these jokes work when they are done with precision and finesse. Sometimes they are done with subtlety or not subtle in the slightest; both of which can be successful or a failure depending on how they are executed. Shimoneta fits the latter quite accurately to say the least. And when I say not subtle, that is taking itlightly.\\n\\n\r\nSet in a dystopian Tokyo where all shamelessness, lewdness, and dirty language has been outlawed, you can already assume ahead of time that Shimoneta is a satire of political correctness. More specifically, how the conservative government of Japan tries to censor any part of a medium that maybe considered morally indecent to the public in their own eyes. Shimoneta wants to portray how their utopia would become a reality and how it would not work based on how human biology works. In other words, humans are sexual creatures through and through, whether we all want to admit that truth or not. Not only that, but it can also be a satire of how sex education is important in our society and an abstinence only education would prove to be a flawed system.\\n\\n\r\nSo does Shimoneta handle this satire well and make it hilarious in the long run? In short, it succeeds to make it into an entertaining anime with some subtle level of commentary to go by with it. Take, for instance, the character Anna, voiced by the recently passed Miyu Matsuki, who would be the archetype for a person who wants to be a pure person with no perverted characteristics. But because of an accidental kiss by the main character Tanukichi, that triggered a romantic spark into her brain that causes to develop urges that she never knew before. Shimoneta gives a pretty intelligent method of showing us the intricacies of how teenagers go through hormonal phases once they bloom into full-grown sexual young adulthood. It can also be enjoyed just as a silly joke and nothing else as well and Shimoneta obviously characterizes itself as either or just one alternative outlook.\\n\\n\r\nAnother commentary that Shimoneta does exceptionally well is how they portray the dystopian society of conservative political correctness. It does not do it in such a way where it is done in a forceful manner that it becomes preachy as a result. Rather it keeps that theme in the background where it doesn\u2019t seem too apparent for the viewer to be distracted by and doesn\u2019t overshadow the comedy. Shimoneta wants to be a wacky sex comedy through and through with some added commentary mixed in, in order to make it unique from other anime ecchi shows. Even with a rape scene involving a woman licking a guy\u2019s chest out of sexual gratification in a  non-consensual, it still manages to be hilarious and offer an intelligent insight that invertedly challenges our notion of how we can find things of this nature funny from a different set of circumstances. At least that is how I interpreted it.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy pulls so many punches to the viewer that it can be a bit much for the squeamish. But I love it when my ecchi anime pulls no limits to what it can do to either entertain or offend those who turn their nose up at shamelessness of this caliber. Simply put, Shimoneta is the most raunchy, lewd, indecent, and crazy ecchi anime I\u2019ve ever come across, and probably you\u2019ll ever come across. And I mean these with the utmost positive feelings that I could ever muster. Its clever ways of censoring dialogue to make us decipher what the characters are saying with some obvious hints based on context keeps its tone and comedic timing on-point and humorous from beginning to end. Many of its innuendos, whether it be visual or audible, might be forced in some cases but they help create a comedic atmosphere that keeps the show from being tedious and boring. Even some of the jokes that the writers came up took my breath away from how much they are willing to get away with. So much so that I think no other country except Japan would ever allow on television.\\n\\n\r\nNot only does the comedy work with the theme and atmosphere, but it also gives the characters some nice needed charm to make up for their lack of development. Truth be told, the characters are not the most three-dimensional. Most of them have the one characteristic that defines them as a character, whether it be wanting sweet love nectar, obsessed with drawing shameless pictures, or wanting to rid themselves of the purity police controlling people\u2019s language and sex lives. Nevertheless, I found myself slightly forgiving this negative from how much I enjoyed the chemistry between our main hero Tanukichi and main heroine Ayame. Heck, almost all of the characters have wonderful chemistry between one another from the hilarious interactions and dialogues that are clever and done with great comedic timing. One other character worth mentioning is the art prodigy Otome who\u2019s brash and crazy attitude adds so much to the cast thanks to the always hilarious Satomi Arai doing her Kuroko voice from A Certain Scientific Railgun.\\n\\n\r\nI found myself enjoying the creative art designs of the characters from how colorful and expressive they exhibit. There are some areas where I think the art can be a bit too bright and white-washed in some scenes. Overall, technically Shimoneta is a nicely animated show with many comedic gags having a great sense of depth and absurdity despite the fact that it is censored, in an ironic fashion. I would not necessarily call the music a highlight of the show, even though I found myself enjoying the ED with its combination of jazz-influenced horns and J-Pop vocals. The music from the show itself is not very special in the slightest and I found myself not paying much attention to it while watching.\\n\\n\r\nIt is hard for me to reminisce about this show without some fascination about it. I found myself intrigued with the possibility of ecchi anime like Shimoneta existing more often, if this ever becomes a big hit in the future, after watching it. Not just in how balls to the wall it is with its subject matter and jokes, but how it can offer a witty way of implementing a theme that is synonymous with sexual aspects of real life. Ecchi, of course, is here to give us some sexual gratification to hone our skills of being lewd in real life. It feels welcoming to see an anime like Shimoneta to prove that it can be more than that in more ways than one.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-\\n",

            "content": "Oh boy, hold on to your underpants for this one... Shimoneta literally means dirty joke, and you'll get more than both ears worth in this show. Whereas Seitokai Yakuindomo had a lot of implied dirty jokes, Shimonata literally doesn't hold any punches. Though I'm still not quite sure how this got on TV, expect everything in the ecchi drawing book from panties and upskirts galore to what can only be described as soft core porn with many smiley stickers on the screen.\r\nThe show is about, ironically, an idealized Japan where everything lewd is purged Fahrenheit 451 style; and where everyone is forced to wear braceletstracked by Big Brother. In this world, we find a girl \"terrorist\" who spreads lewd pictures and wears a panty on her head as a mask in the name of celebrating sexuality. Into this comes our protagonist, the son of an erotic terrorist who wants nothing more than to go to school with his idealized figure of purity, Anna. While trying to save another student from being falsely accused of molestation, Tanukichi is targeted by the accuser and saved from the police -er... morality officers- by none other than the girl terrorist. How will this fateful encounter ripple through this innocent Japan? Be warned, this show is not for the faint of heart- proceed only if shows like High School DxD or ImoCho do not faze you.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe show is drawn in a bright color palette with average backgrounds and lighting. The funding seems focused on the ridiculous variety of ecchi in the show. From indecent postcards to sparkling \"love juice\", expect all sorts of soft core attempts to awaken a dude's walrus (they apparently chose that instead of the more typical elephant). In any case, expect this to be one of the most outrageously in-your-face ecchi shows out there. As for character styling, everyone is... unique I guess? All I can say is, not everyone is as pure as they initially seem...\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe puns and dirty jokes continue even into the OP and EDs (some of which \"educate\" the viewer into how to make a \"pleasant\" mold among other things). The OP has an unnecessarily long introduction before launching into a rather old-sounding song, though it's clearly designed for the show. Annoyingly, the main theme is catchy- just make sure no one catches you humming to it in public. The funky ED, if anything, is even more catchy and fitting for the show; note that the lyrics are pretty NSFW. The BGM has many brass instruments, fitting for the ecchi-based theme. However, more noticeable is the virtually endless visual and auditory censoring.\\n\\n\r\nAs for VAs, you have a mix between veterans and relative new actors. On the veteran's side, you have the instantly-recognizable voice of Satomi Arai, and, amazingly, Yui Horie voicing a young brat, whose hair takes the form of a certain mushroom shape when she get's \"energized\". Oh, and if you feel a need to control your bulge when listening to Anna, don't forget that you're listening to the aroused groans of a 38-year-old veteran. Overall, expect a fair performance with a ridiculous amount of screaming and censoring.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nAs alluded to earlier, the show is about a terrorist organization called \"SOX\" and its efforts to spread dirty jokes and, to a more benign degree, sexual education to the general populace. The show successfully pokes fun of the glaring problems when there is no sexual education for children, while also ignoring the ridiculous improbability of such a world existing in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThe show follows a central plotline with a well established pattern of introducing supporting characters before launching into a few arcs each with a small climax, not counting those in your pants. There aren't very many plot twists, and the few that are present are given huge amounts of foreshadowing so that seasoned viewers should be able to pretty much guess their way through the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nThe mood of the show is, for the most part, very light and filled with (as the title implies) dirty jokes and ecchi. The actual plot is rather mild in intensity, and doesn't really make very much progress. The core of this show is the dirty jokes, and if that's not what you're here for you're better off looking elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI ought to echo what I just said above, but for the sake of entertainment, I won't. The characters in this show are not that great, they have barely any exposition and really are all just sexually-curious teenagers, regardless of whether or not they actually state so. I guess both Tanukichi and Anna are dynamic characters, though Anna sort of feels like she's taken directly from a hentai at times. Don't expect much from this category, unless your goal is to see characters in outrageous outfits and circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nThough dirty jokes can be a fair tool at appropriate times, this show takes it far, far beyond that. The show with supposedly the highest moral-based setting is ironically one of the most lecherous, non-hentai works out there. Though unique in its approach, I wouldn't be surprised if many people shun its parody; similar to how one could shun 30sai. This show is for those who appreciate ecchi, and can handle it in large quantities. For everyone else, may your eyes find more peaceful sights elsewhere.",

            "content": "Shimoneta is Summer 2015's most prominent ecchi comedy series and has finally concluded its first season. It is very difficult to write an objective review of something as subjective as an ecchi comedy but in the case of Shimoneta it has an advantage that others do not; It has absolutely no plot.\r\nLet's begin; It's a sex-comedy show established as being about a group of Naughty Terrorists that want to spread sex education in a world that suppresses all sexuality similar to what feminism wants to do in the real world but I digress. A totalitarian government exists and does not let people draw or saythings that could be construed as lewd, because of this, people are wildly ignorant about sex and that's where SOX comes in.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is episodic (somewhat) and is about missions undertaken by the members of SOX, it sounds a lot more exciting than it actually is... it is , in reality, a basic framework and backdrop for the real meat and potatoes which is, telling as many dirty jokes as possible. In this reviewer's humble opinion, they don't work, they're forced and are unfunny. \\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters are Kajou Akame (Female lead) and Tanukichi Okuma (Male lead), both are serviceable , if a bit boring... but their actions do have a lot of energy and when they interact it can lead to funny situations. That being said, the situations are often hit-or-miss, mostly miss. But what I can tell you about a comedy anime other than, I didn't find it funny? well, the leads are average at best and most of the supporting cast is weak but.... it has two characters in it which absolutely stole the show.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, Anna Nikishinomiya and Fuwa Hyouka. \\n\r\nTelling you about these characters would be a disservice to them , partially spoiling their charm, but let me tell you that the creators of this show knew that the leads were a bit dull and threw in these two to fill in the quota of comedy, it works, at least for me. \\n\\n\\n\r\nHonestly this is the worst review I have written. There is no story, there is no character development, there is very little in the form of artwork other than the basics so I can't critique it as I would a normal show. All I can tell you is, I would have rated this *VERY* low if not for those two members of the supporting cast I mentioned. They are unique, they are new, they are interesting, the things they do are so mind-jarringly strange that it is truly a treat when they show up.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for sex, this show has none, no actual sex ever takes place.\\n\r\nIf you are looking for fast-paced, sexually suggestive comedy, this will have it.\\n\r\nIf you are looking for an intricate plot and character development, this does NOT have it.\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a diverse, unique, interesting cast of characters, this does NOT have it.\\n\r\nIf you want to see a woman trick a man into eating cookies made with her love juice, this is the show for you.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it, it only just barely.",

            "content": "Lately censorship has become completely unreasonable and an anime tackling this problem sounded promising, but oh how wrong it all went.\r\nLets start with the story.The anime takes place sometime in the future when Japan has banned all things \u201cimmoral\u201d. Our main character Tanukichi Okuma has just transferred to the elite public morals school where he is quickly summoned to join the student council to help fight the terrorist organisation SOX that is fighting against censorship, but he almost immediately gets blackmailed by one of the council members Ayame Kajou, who is actually one of the terrorists, to join the terrorists and commit obscene acts.\r\nWell thewhole concept is not all that bad and could be made perfectly enjoyable, however the sheer amount of unnecessary profanity made the whole thing barely watchable. First off why should every other sentence spoken in the show reference either sex, masturbation or intimate body parts, that might be funny the first few times but after less than ten minutes it started to get old and after the first episode it was just painful. Most of the episodes were abysmal, but the surprising thing is that the ending was quite enjoyable and the anime ended on a positive note so I couldn\u2019t give it an even lower score.\\n\\n\r\nSometimes a bad story can be offset by great characters, but that sure as hell does not apply here. Our main character is one of the blandest out there, he manages to have no defining traits, we know next to nothing about his backstory and even his actions are dictated by someone else most of the time. Are the others any better? Well they are, but they are still poorly developed and completely one dimensional. The members of SOX can\u2019t even speak normally without obnoxious sexual references. The one character who shines is Fuwa, as she manages to be the only one who is not overly annoying with her jokes and is one of the only reasons I managed to sit through this travesty, but unfortunately her screen time is limited. The relationships between characters are as poorly developed as the characters. One relationship stands out the most and that is the one between Okuma and his crush, the student council president Ana. The scenes between these two made me want to puke at times, it was just so wrong and disgusting.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was nothing to write home about, but it still managed to work well enough. Here I want to touch the absolutely retarded way of censoring in the \u201cuncensored\u201d version with stickers that looked like the body part it was covering. I have no idea who thought that it would be fun, but it just came out as immature as the rest of the series. Still that does not mean there was no fan-service as it was plentiful and completely tasteless, why would one want to constantly see bodily fluids of our characters. The soundtrack itself was not bad, but the opening was just awful, the ending was not much better so neither made their way into my iTunes library.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all watching this has been quite the ordeal and it was probably the worse anime I have ever seen, and if it wasn\u2019t for the last few episodes this would have surely gotten a score lower than 3, but considering the ending was not even bad it just manages to scrape up a score of 5 out of 10. Do I recommend this to anyone? To be frank no, I do not think it is worth your time as there are so many better shows out there. In the end it was sad that I found an anime that fights against censorship, to be one of the best examples why some form of censorship is sometimes needed.\\n\r\nI really hope you enjoyed reading the review and I kindly ask you to leave some feedback so I can improve my writing.

            "content": "\"Pornography does not create perversions, it merely arouses a pervert's imagination.\" \r\n   Shimoneta is the kind of anime that not everyone will like or enjoy by any means (obviously) as it is.. well.. crude as hell. It is intended for people who like shameless sexual humor, and that is it's target audience. Now my reason for giving it the score that I did is based mostly on my enjoyment of the series and it's over the top nature rather than it's plot and characters which are pretty average as far as anime goes. Now lets get into the meaty details.\r\n   Story:6 - This is a series that by no means should be taken seriously. It is not the kind of anime that you go into for a complex or compelling narrative. Now, I think that the scenario given to us is better than most others in that it takes place in an alternate Japan where anything deemed \"immoral\" by it's government was banned and deemed illegal. This is possibly commentary on how Japan already censor's much of it's sexual content already, except here taken to the extreme obviously.\\n\r\n   The main plot revolves around a male student attending a new high-school (like we haven't seen this before) before he gets himself wrapped up in a terrorist organization run by another high-school student who goes by the code-name \"Blue Snow\" whose plan is to rid japan of the oppressive censorship and to return everything to as it once was. \\n\r\n  Pretty standard stuff really, although don't expect a lot of plot progression or deep twists here, really the bulk of the show lies in it's gags and situational humor.\\n\\n\r\n  Art: 8 - Nothing to say as far as art goes, it stays pretty consistent and I never really found myself groaning at any flaws as far as character design or animation goes. \\n\\n\r\n  Sound: 7 - Same goes for sound. I like both the intro and the outro themes very much, and everything else as far as sound design goes is pretty run of the mill and nothing special. \\n\\n\r\n  Character: 6 - Unfortunately as far as characters go in Shimoneta, they're as you expect for this kind of genre. Most of the side characters have really only one personality trait and are very one-dimensional. Now by no means do I  expect incredibly deep and compelling characters in an anime where the main gag is about f*cking, but I at least want something a little bit better than what we keep getting is all. Not all characters are like this fortunately, as I found  Ayame (Blue Snow) pretty enjoyable as well as a few others I can't mention because spoilers. I don't HATE what was done here, but I do want to see a bit more personality out of more of the cast rather than just the few that do.\\n\\n\r\n  Enjoyment: 7 - I have to admit, I really enjoyed watching this. Even with all of it's flaws I still found myself wanting to watch the next episode just to see what ridiculous sh*t would happen next. The jokes aren't anything smart or intelligent by any means, and I'm ok with that. Shimoneta is something that you turn your brain off and just enjoy, nothing more and nothing less than mindless entertainment in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\n  Overall: 7/10 - As I said before, this isn't for everyone. If you are a fan of over the top crude adult humor than this is the anime for you. But for everyone else, I say give it a shot...  but don't go in with high expectations.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Shimoneta and I have a love hate relationship. \r\nStory.\r\nThe premise that porno-terrorists survive in a post-porn Japan is a fun one. Picturing groups of young ones running around re-educating the Japanese in the ways of the pervent makes me chuckle inside. \r\nThe problem is that this greater story is rarely touched up. Many of the 12 episodes are based on recruitment. Others are on interpersonal relationships, but other than a passing mention, the plot at large goes both unexplored and unremembered, as well as unresolved.\r\nThis is an anime with great artwork that -could- have been much much more. There is some obvious creative thought thatwent into some of the cast of characters, but oddly enough, it's the main two protagonists (if you can call a terrorist a protagonist), that are the least fleshed out. Both are bland and uninspired, in contrast to the rest of the crew.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development and identity exist though, in splotches. The characters that were thought out are great. Almost every scene with Fuwa, a creepy scientist on the verge of understanding reproduction between humans,  is hilarious. Gouriki, a large man who doesn't know he's gay because the term doesn't exist anymore, is funny to watch. Anna has great lines and colors, hilarious action, and a strong if sudden change of heart that changes the theme of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs a comedy, it works. Anything else is beyond the show, which is greater than the sum of it's parts. \\n\\n",

Basically this show is one of that anime series that you cant watch with your family unless they are really open minded because the jokes are dirty and thats what the anime want to show. \r\nThe story starts with a boy (Okuma) who finally is aproved to a great school, but the problem is the school is one of the most rigid when it comes about morals. The context of the plot is that in Japan is prohibited to use dirtywords like p*nis, v*gina, and etc. Students even dont know how sex is made and how people have babies. \\n\\n\r\nSo a terrorist called Setsugen no Ao appears with a pantsu on her head and trow pictures of nudity in the street. I'm not gonna tell the story here because if you want to know you need to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is great, its very similar to the novel, the characters are so funny, speciially Setsugen no Ao. Theres a girl with a hair like a p*nis head, a scientist student that have no emotions and keep following the protagonist asking him how babies are made, Anna whos the president of the moral concil on the school the protagonist just arrived, and later on reveals herself a \"crazy\" person.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is 10, outstanding because the songs are funny just like the anime and the seyus are great. Setsugen no Ao is voiced by the ones who was the voice for Shiodome Akira from Naga no Asukara and Okuma was voiced by the same man who made the protagonist from Witch craft works, both great animes.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a masterpiece for those who wants to just see dirty jokes and funny characters. This isnt for that moments when you want some deep plot about time travel like Steins;gate, or a complex world context like Shinsekai yori. This anime series is SIMPLE but that what makes it so great.\\n\r\nFor the reviews above, you should watch at least more than 200 anime series to tell something. Watching Naruto, One Piece, Bleach only doesnt give you the rights to deeply analyze animes like this.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are searching for a great with dirty conversations anime series THIS IS THE MASTERPIECE show you are looking for.\\n\\n\\n\r\nA WORLD WITHOUT DIRTY JOKES IS BORING!!!\\n\\n\r\nSETSUGEN NO AO, AISHITEIRU!!!!",

But boy I was so wrong.\r\nThis is a piece of art when it comes to comedy. I truly am unable to remember when I laughed so much while watching an anime or a TV series.\r\nAnyway now let's break it down in categories.\r\n-Story: 8-\r\nThe story of this is well...just good. The action takes part 16 years after almost any trace of pornographyis destroyed and it became illegal to use any bad words. In schools kids were taught to be totally sexually oblivious until Blue Snow , a female terrorist destroys the peace.\\n\\n\r\n-Art: 10-\\n\r\nI'm not exactly an artist so I can just say the art is extremely good, just like in most animes in the last 2 years.\\n\\n\r\n-Sound: 10-\\n\r\nThe sound fx in this anime is worth more than 10.It is hilariously good. From the theme songs that are just as funny as the jokes in the anime to the verbal puns that make you die of laughter.\\n\\n\r\n-Character: 9-\\n\r\nWell all the characters seem pretty well designed and all add to the hilarity either with their obliviousness to sexual matters or their exaggerated passion for them.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment: 9-\\n\r\nI can say that I really loved it and I am thankful I watched it.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall: 9-\\n\r\nAs long as you look at it from a strictly comedic point of view you can say this truly deserves its score.",

            "content": "CONTENT WARNING: This anime contains...\r\nTons of bad sex jokes that are not even funny, an absolutely ridiculous plot, lewd/nude scenes, and overall is just flat out crazy.\r\nViewer discretion is advised!\r\nIf you are still interested, lets get started! We'll talk about the story, comedy, things to take from the anime, and some final thoughts.\r\nStory:\r\nOne good look at this anime's synopsis should hint you in, this story is absolutely ridiculous. Even the opening scene gave me the sense of utter disbelief. It's good to prepare yourself for this fact because if you choose to quit that's all you will see it as, absolutely crazy, not that youwould be wrong.\\n\\n\r\nAfter a run in with Ayame and then being recruited by her, Tanukichi gets involved in tons of ridiculous activities to help her \"educate\" the \"pure\" society.\\n\\n\r\nActually we could literally wrap it up there...\\n\\n\r\nYet, I don't really think that does it justice. Even though its simple it somehow manages to keep being funny. It only descends further into hysteria and madness as it goes on.\\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling anything I want to say absolutely nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nComedy:\\n\\n\r\nI'd like you to be very aware when I say I found it hilarious there is something you should know.\\n\\n\r\nI don't mean it had jokes really well thought out or original. No, the dirty jokes was about as bad as they come. Unoriginal, overused, and absolutely downright lame. That alone is the reason why I chuckled and laughed the whole way through. Wearing underwear on your head to conceal your identity and other gags are just terrible. Again, why I found them funny.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of this it may be better if you don't come in with a high standard expectation of the comedy. It will absolutely drop you if you think stupid things are funny. Its comedy focuses on not by being genius or clever but by sticking to the same principles the story follows, which is to be ridiculous for comedic effect.\\n\\n\r\nValues/Learning from Anime:\\n\\n\r\nIt's clear the story wants you to take something away but its easy to ignore due to the comedic and very unserious nature of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I don't like reading what an anime is telling me at face value. I try to think of how it applies to reality.\\n\\n\r\nFrom what I gathered, thinking about a future with everything you say being monitored/sanctioned is scary alone. No matter if it is for a good cause or not.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a future that is undeniable in a digital age. Being tracked, monitored, and sanctioned. No, it won't be a collar on our neck tracking dirty words as that is useless in reality. However, if you take a moment to realize everything we are doing is an online presence and can be tracked... that is truly a real reality. Our lives and internet data are worth money and have prices put on them daily.\\n\\n\r\nIs this story that crazy? Maybe its not that crazy after all...\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nI rated this a 9 but don't think I found it perfect.\\n\\n\r\nI'm slightly disappointed in some ways.\\n\\n\r\nI knew it had Ecchi as one of the genres listed before I even watched it but for a couple of episodes it actually just seemed to make only dirty jokes. I was about to say it was just a nice funny show that is until it \"stepped up its game\". \\n\\n\r\nQuite frankly I was disappointed it did but it only makes sense regarding what they do in the story has REAL effect on people. \\n\\n\r\nSome people it uh... maybe had a little too much effect on... like... whoa... chill.\\n\\n\r\nI wished I could have made the review more in depth but this really is a simple anime in many senses. It was still really fun but I think I'd just be rambling on about it if I talked about it more.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\\n\r\n-This is lewd\\n\r\n-The jokes are bad\\n\r\n-The characters are nuts\\n\r\n-The story is simple but absolutely nuts\\n\r\n-If you like stupid fun go watch it\\n\\n\r\nIf you want something super serious or some \"highly intelligent jokes\", in the words of Big Smoke from Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\\n\\n\r\n\"YOU PICKED THE WRONG HOUSE, FOOL!\"",

What a mouth full of a title, and this mouth is full of enjoyment.\r\nPretty much the general story line is, no dirty, sexual or pornographic items of all variety are removed, and the used of people choice of words and actions to imply these acts would be punished by extreme means. However, there is a group called S.O.X, which is made up of teenagers, whom want this to change and want to teach their classmates how to \"combine\" and other forbidden topics. Thismakes the overall story line a bit bland however I do believe this is made up with the amount of dirty and sexual puns that are made throughout the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Sound of the series is good, with random stats of information getting placed on screen during a revalant part of the episode or a logo being placed over naughty parts. Soundtrack is good for the background music and the opening and ending themes are suited to the topic of the series. \\n\\n\r\nWith the characters, it is your usual group of leader lady, creepy chick and weirdo woman, but with one differences. those who believed Yuno from Future Diaries is screwed in the head, the supporting character named Anna  takes that title from her as the most fucked up Yandere character. But this did give a lot of comedic entertainment, I personally wouldn't a woman like that in my life.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall enjoyment was great because of the dirty jokes, puns and the bizarre characters that are also in this series, though I wasn't happy with the ending of the series, I do hope there is another  season. \\n\\n\r\nStory          6/10\\n\r\nArt              7/10\\n\r\nSound         7/10\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment  9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall score of 7/10",

            "content": "The only reason this \"review\" even exists is that yours truly literally couldn't bear the thought of this dirty-jokes-gem not getting the deserved attention and approval. However, rather than discussing story, characters and other stuff (already done very well in other reviews), let's state: this anime is extremely Educational. And, before you get the wrong idea - yours truly is not talking about the \"how-to-make-babies\" education, as nowadays even 8yo kids have a vague idea about this stuff. No, the real deal is that censored TV version and yet-to-be-finished BD have a lot of differencies, and not only in the common \"oh no, they censoredpanties\" sense. Let me state this: for anyone learning Japanese language and culture, the uncut BD version is nothing less than priceless. \\n\\n\r\nSome examples (only lightest spoilers, feel free to read): in the 1 ep., when the female protagonist persuaded the male one to join her organisation, she showed some hand gesture which was censored in TV version. While wondering what could that gesture be, and thus by comparing it to the BD, yours truly discovered it being the famous \"fig sign\". But why would they censor it? And more importantly, why is it even there (in the country yours truly was born, this gesture means \"rejection of giving help/item/et\u0441\")? So, after a small investigation, it turned out the fig sign means none other but \"s*xual intercourse\" in Japan! Oh, unlike me, you already knew that? Then yours truly shall bless you with another one. \\n\\n\r\nEarlier in the same ep., when the mentioned female MC revealed her true identity as the dirty-jokes-terrorist Setsugen no Ao to the male MC in the cafe, she made another, also censored gesture, and greeted him with \"\u4ee5\u5f8c\u3088\u308d\u3057\u3053\u3057\u3053!\", literally \"Igo, yoroshiko-shiko\". It sounds, as you anime-dwellers surely noticed, very similar to the common phrase in Japanese \u3088\u308d\u3057\u304f \"yoroshiku\", kinda like \"nice to meet you\". However, this difference combined with the mentioned-above censored gesture got yours truly captivated enough to do yet some more research, and guess what? Japanese language, as you probably know, is full of the so-called onomatopoeia words (wiki \"Japanese sound symbolism\"), and \u30b7\u30b3\u30b7\u30b3 \"shiko-shiko\" is used for, no joking here, expressing the act of o**nism (proof, if you're interested http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q136220023)! The lovely hand of unrivalled Setsugen no Ao, gracefully uncensored in BD, confirmed it, meaning the whole scene is an ultimate wordplay! And these are but a few examples, there are more in just 1st ep., let alone the whole series! \\n\\n\r\nI'm not even mentioning all those \"dirty\" words like \"d**k\", \"p**sy\", \"b**ls\", etc.., abundant and censored with disgusting \"beep\" in TV, are finally being revealed in all its audible BD glory! Surely, you may know some of them if you ever watched H*ntai, but hardly all of them. Besides, these are not the ones you deal with during your Japanese classes. Unless you happen to have close Japanese friends who could freely talk to you about such things and explain vague moments, this anime is probably your only chance to get acknowledged with the wonderful world of Japanese dirty jokes. \u4e0b\u30cd\u30bf\u4e07\u6b73\uff01",

Good art and a good really catchy opening Characters are good Anna definitely is one of the best yandere girls we have seen in a while i honestly don't really know what to say about this except fot the fact is really damn funny and if you are a fan of dirty joke humor you will receive many laughs from this series. I enjoyed just about everything if you are a fan of dirty jokes this series is a jewel in a pile of rocks.",

            "content": "This is a short, spoiler free review (well, I'll be honest, aside from the characters, there's basically no major things that can be spoiled in this anime). Also, I'm assuming you've already read the plot or watched the anime, so no need to do any introductions.\r\nStory: 8\r\nNow this anime is very simple, and the story isn't deep at all, so you can't start watching this expecting a serious plot. With that said, some people might find this extreme or cheesy, and some might find it funny and comedic. It really depends on what kind of humor you've got to like the story. And it's gottabe dirty humor! \"A world where perverted things aren't allowed, no, aren't even legal\" that would be the summary if I had to write it short and easy. Where would you see yourself in such a world? Against the law, with the law or living neutral to everything? Well, your answer might change after you watch this.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art was amazing. Looked like a lot of anime that I've seen so I wouldn't say \"epic\" or \"unusual\" but also very well made and never lacking or awkward. There are no actual fight scenes in here, but you can see some action and that's also very well made. Every character design was special and different so that rises the score a lot to me!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nKeeping this short and simple. The BGM was good and went very well with whatever was happening and the OP was alright but not memorable. The ED tho, was very fun to me. I actually ended up listening to it on every episode AND dancing along with the characters!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nLet's not dive in very deep as this is the only spoiler-full zone. In co-ed anime (where there are both male and female characters) it's nearly impossible for me to not dislike a character. However this anime managed to keep me very neutral to some of the characters I could've found annoying in other situations. Why outstanding though? Well, I couldn't choose a favourite! Anna was amazing in everything and she would've been my first choice but I also really liked Fuwa and Tsukimigusa. AND not only that, but all the other characters were very well made. Funny but didn't annoying one bit!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nNow I mentioned above that you may like this or not depending on your humor, and it goes the same for whether you're going to enjoy this or not. This is a comedy and parody anime, and people tend to have VERY different opinions on what's funny and what's not; so if you're not a fan of dirty humor and a lot of censored but understandable dirty talk and scenes, then this is not for you. However, if you are, then this is a hidden treasure of laughs and joy. I must admit that there wasn't even one episode that didn't make me giggle.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8- Very good.",

If you ever thought that sexual repression was so hard before as it is today, is because you have no knowledge of older neither ancient cultures. Even in the Victorian Uk (the most repressive society I can think of at the moment), the only group affected with such repression was a particular circle of society, not all of it. \r\nSorry for the explanation,but I think that is needed to understand Shimoneta. This story exaggerates the sexual repression to a sci-fi extent. Then, you can find your all clich\u00e9 characters but also, the main heroine, that is something worth to expend your watching time handling with. \\n\\n\r\nTake Suzumiya and put it's cast on another setting, take all the ESPER nonsense out and put actual human sexual drives on it, add a tiny bit of a plot, and there you have Shimoneta.",

Each character is distinct and memorable both in design and personality. \r\nOkuma, the lead male character is clever and reserved in a way that is both believable and refreshing for the role even if he looks like any other male protagonist in a harem or high school show. \r\nHis partner in crimeKajou is delightfully rude and has a very strong and persuasive personality that matches well with Okuma and the rest of the SOX team.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters who really stood out to me is the leud artist Saotome and the minor character Fuwa who's odd antics strangely enough have a lot of bearing on the actual narrative. \\n\\n\r\nIf you have an interest in all things taboo or just good character design I highly recommend you check it out.",

            "content": "Shimoneta is a clever show behind all the dick jokes and sexual innuendo that it presents during its 12 episodes. It is basically a dick-slap at censorship laws. It's a show that glorifies obscenities, sexual jokes, and that being liberal and being able to watch whatever you want is OK. And it is right!\r\nHowever, its story could've been better done. It's divided in two different arcs. The first episodes are more for establishing the characters, what the SOX \"perosisuto\" organization wants, and the \"main antagonists\" in the figure of the government who has established the censorship/moral control laws. However the second part includes. However, mostof the second part is about another organization, which has different ideas than SOX. And this is the part that wasn't good at all. I mean, it still enjoyed of the jokes that are the essence of the series, but they continuously fall flat and really, the main antagonist was really a hit or miss to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art, on the other hand... I still cannot believe that this series was one of the best animated anime of the season. Bright colors and different character designs are everywhere, and the animation presented during more active scenes was top-notch, fluid, and beautiful. In the sound department, however, there's nothing to talk about. The only thing good that can be considered as entertaining and memorable is the ending.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, where the show really shines is in the characters. Not that they have been fully developed and one can relate to any of them, but because they are likeable and funny as HEEEEEELL. Ayame is the heart of the anime, as she's the leader of SOX and the one that is constantly making dick jokes that are most of the time fun, and one cannot forget her speech at the 11th episode, it was sincerely the best part of the show. Tanukichi shined when he had to do all the dirty job of SOX, and more especially when he was assaulted by Anna (claps for Tanukichi's VA). And that leaves us with Anna-senpai. She starts as the role model of the government laws, and the pure president of the student council. But after the 3rd or 4th episode she changed drastically, becoming the best character of the show and maybe the best character of 2015. Her frenetic rampages and over-the-top strength was simply hilarious, and the direction really help to make her shine everytime goes crazy (Love nectar cookies were one of the most disgusting, yet hilarious scenes of the show). Otome, Kosuri, Goriki, Hyoka, and to a lesser extent sensitive-chan complete the package of outstanding characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOnce Shimoneta started airing, I thought, judging by the title, that it was going to be full of stupid fan-service, boob shots, and dick jokes that I was going to drop after the 3rd episode. I have never been so wrong in my life. There is incredibly no stupid fan-service (when there is, it is ironically censored with chibi figures of our main characters), that is reserved for the \"terrorist attacks\" of SOX, boob shots were almost eliminated, and the dick jokes were 90 % on point and fun. \\n\\n\r\nI believe that once it is released in BD/DVD, we'll get the show with almost none censorship, and I would be the first one to pre-order the show if FUNImation decides to dub this one, as Shimoneta needs it immediately! So if you want to have some fun with sexual jokes and over-the-top characters, don't waste any more time and enter FUNImation to start watching it!\\n",

            "content": "Show of hands: who like innuendo?\r\nThought so.\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe story is... unique in execution, but not in design. It's a tale of political extremism, where certain viewpoints are all but destroyed to make way for a more \"peaceful\" and \"healthy\" society. If you've read Fahrenheit 451, you know where this is going.\r\nRather than books being banned, it's lewd material. Shimoneta is a tale of extremism in censorship, to the point where you can be arrested for saying just the wrong word, pornography deserves destruction with absolute prejudice, and sexual education is about as existent as Miyazaki's respect for otaku.\r\nWhile I greatly enjoy the idea behind thestory, however, the execution is a little lack-luster. Many episodes are simply a conflict-of-the-week, and the very last episode existed more for fanservice (both visual and emotional) than for plot/character progression.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe art's actually fairly well done. The character designs aren't fantastically unique (brown-haired protagonist, circle under the eyes scientist, gorilla-like brute, silver-haired symbol of purity, etc.) Still, the animation flowed fairly well. Nothing stand-out, but certainly not bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe music complemented the scenes pretty well, and there were censorship noises that matched the words being bleeped, rather than just being a constant drone of actual bleeps. Still, it wasn't fantastic or all that memorable, and the opening was WAY too cheesy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters, are actually pretty good. I'll get my one gripe out of the way first: they're fairly one-note, sadly. Save for the male lead, very little progression occurs, and the three main characters act more as symbols than actual people. Effective in this story, but they could have been done better. That said, let's talk about their effectiveness as symbols, shall we.\\n\\n\r\nFirst up is Kajou. The female lead and head terrorist, she's definitely great at symbolizing the anarchy of \"freedom for dirty jokes above all else\". She's constantly spouting innuendos, dirty words, and lewd gestures everywhere. It's almost to the point where you wonder how ANYTHING gets done with her. She seems to have no focus, or goals other than making her next dirty joke. A symbol that freedom, without direction, just leads to chaos... and annoyance.\\n\\n\r\nNext up is Anna. Our resident symbol of the purity of the show, she, naturally, has no knowledge of how sex, love, or arousal work. Guess how well that turns out? About a third of the way through the show, she goes off of the deep end, mistaking her sexual attraction for the male lead for love. This, in turn leads to assault, breaking and entering, theft, stalking, attempted rape, and baking cookies using sexual fluids. Yeah. Just got REALLY creepy. A massive symbol that purity, when forced onto others without their consent, or proper education, leads to the same chaos that you were trying to prevent.\\n\\n\r\nThen, we've got Okuma, the male lead and straight man of the show. He's constantly having to mellow out Kajou's... eccentricities, while trying to stay away from Anna because he can't bear to tell her that she's becoming the very impurity that she's been trying to fight. Honestly, he's the best symbol of what a nice compromise between educated chaos and self-imposed purity can do as a stabilizing force in society. Heck, he even gets to grow by learning that he shouldn't force total purity on himself, lest he stagnate. Plus, all work and no play.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nThis will drastically change based upon your tastes. A lot of the humor either involves crude jokes or slapstick. The slapstick was brilliantly done, and I found myself legitimately laughing out loud in several spots. Some of the crude humor was enjoyable as well, from innuendos to sex-based puns. Still, it went over the deep end SEVERAL times, making it uncomfortable in parts.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, there's Anna's breakdown. Starting at about episode 4, it starts off funny and just gets very dark and disturbing. It lightens up a little towards the end, but not enough to make me stop cringing every time the psycho was on screen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\r\nI can't recommend this to everyone. For me, it sits on the fence between a 6(fair) and 7(good). It all depends on what you can stomach. If you hate crude jokes, avoid at all costs. This show ain't worth it. However, if you think you can stomach them, disgusting cookies and all, and you enjoy societal satires, give it a try. Not a must-watch, but it had high-points.",

            "content": "Overall, I found Shimoneta to be an enjoyable anime. Compared to other 12-episode comedy series I\u2019ve watched, Shimoneta is about average. It\u2019s not particularly bad, but there aren\u2019t elements in it that wow me. I don\u2019t really have any complaints about the characters and settings worth mentioning, although the plot feels incomplete.\r\nOne unfortunate aspect of Shimoneta is that it\u2019s all too easy to write it off as nothing more than a comedy featuring (censored) sexual content. It\u2019s important to note that although it\u2019s not a deep anime by any stretch of the imagination, Shimoneta presents some lessons that the viewer can take away. It does;however, require looking past its superficial sexual aesthetic to glean them.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, it's fairly obvious that Shimoneta explores the effects that censorship or the suppression of free speech can have on society. Obviously, the anime also touches upon the concept of sexuality. It specifically pokes at our conflicting perceptions about it \u2013 is it normal? Is it dirty? Why do we feel that way? \\n\\n\r\nBeyond this superficial content, Shimoneta also shows the dangers of obsessively pursuing righteousness and other ideals. It shows the audience how self-righteousness can blind us from truth and reality. Shimoneta is also about a growing social movement. Given that it\u2019s only 12 episodes, I\u2019d say the anime does a reasonably good job of representing some of the challenges that every social movement faces. For instance, what happens when new members join a social movement, but don\u2019t really understand what it truly represents? What happens when the purpose of a social movement is not particularly clear? What kind of effects does this have on society and the movement, itself? What kinds of challenges are presented to the movement as a result? These are some of the questions Shimoneta explores. Granted, it\u2019s nothing deep, but there are small gems of lessons that can be learned from watching Shimoneta. As with all gems, in general, the viewer must dive below the surface to get to them.  \\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not much to the comedy or the sexual content of Shimoneta, but there are some informative lessons to be gleaned, small as they may be. Thanks for reading!\\n",

            "content": "Shimoneta to Iu gainen ga sonzai shinai taikutsu na sekai (henceforth just shimoneta) was a great anime with a great plot, fanservice, and overall a humorous mood to go with a semi-serious subject. I wouldn't consider this anime worthy of it's R+ nudity rating (no tips on the nips) but it is still quite... arousing. Regardless (ahem) Shimoneta is (in my opinion) an anime worth your time to watch.\r\nStory: \r\nThe story is quite a refreshing move away from the fantasy genre, as this has more comedic value than anything else. Basic storyline is quite repetitive, but there is a gem at the end of theanime. Fanservice fits the story quite well. Overall a decent story. there isn't much to say about it since the story isn't what makes this anime so good, but its worth saying that it is a fresh take on some serious topics. It's also not a harem anime so that also is a plus after watching too many of them.  I don't know where i'm going so 8/10 lets move on. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nArt was amazingly well done. Colorful and eye catching. Also, MCs had regular black hair which was cool to see since usually mcs have some crazy colored hair. the girls are good looking (especially anna) and grow on you. The guy is also not that badly drawn. only thing to complain about is that the episodes are censored in some parts, even in the uncensored versions. I don't understand why you would call it uncensored if it is censored. but i guess it fits with the whole premise of the story so i won't dock a point just for that.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening and closing songs aren't exacly what you would call superstar material, but they are catchy if you like the occasional \"big dick!!\" call in the songs. They are pretty good and, coupled with the dancing of the characters to the music, memorable. voices fit the characters pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nGiven that the premise in itself isn't that serious, It's hardly right to expect some deep character development or character building or character change, but this anime does offer some of that. The main character discovers himself, and a few of the others also change along the way. However, other than that, the characters are funny, and pretty much just meld with the story well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nHere is the meat of the 9/10 for this anime. This anime is FLAT OUT HILARIOUS while also satisfying ecchi urges that one might have. It seamlessly melds ecchi with enjoyment. There were sexual puns everywhere which were actually worth a chuckle, there were scenes where the costumes/ clothing choices made me laugh, and there were also moments where the ecchi was over the top. Yet since the premise is that no one in the anime actually knows what ecchi is, it adds an element of humor in the situational irony of it. The real reason to watch this anime is because it is enjoyable to sit back and watch. You also get some good ecchi scenes without even a single hint of boobs. Take that to heart. This is probably the best anime that is ecchi without showing a hint of full frontal nudity, which is what i enjoy the most. If even a lover of frontal nudity is reccomending a show that has NO FRONTAL NUDITY, that must mean that it is enjoyable enough to make up for the heinous lack of areolae. Of which it does. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nExtremely enjoyable as long as you don't think too hard about it. It is an anime written for fun and relaxed enjoyment, not avid watching with intense thinking. The biggest plus for this anime is definitely it's enjoyment factor, and how it seamlessly melds it's ecchiness into the storyline. The characters really fit the premise as well, and yet are not vapid airheads since they do think for themselves while serving the purpose that the anime gives them. The songs are memorable, which basically means that it is awesome since I usually don't even listen to the songs in the opening and closing. Story gets predictable over the course of it's twelve episodes, but it does have a good ending that leaves a sense of closure rather than a cliffhanger. So to break it down id say 4 for enjoyment + 2 for sound +2 for characters +1 for ecchi story totals to a 9/10 anime. \\n\\n\r\npeace",

I might compare it to Prison School bcuz theyre similar.\r\nWorth watching fo sho. Definitely one of the funniest shows ive seen and it has some romance brewing aswell. Ill first tell you all the things I liked about it and then ill talk some shit about it in the end.\r\n1. Comedy - Found myself laughing uncontrollably quite often 10/10 \r\n2. Romance - It was really good ( Between the 2 main characters atleast ) 9/10\r\n3. Art - Thisshow was really similar to Prison School, but 1 thing that really sets them apart is the art. Prison school had pretty odd art and the girls were hideous which is why I really didnt care about any romance there. Shimoneta on the other hand had the comedy matching up to Prison School AND good art making it better for me atleast. 8/10 \\n\r\n4. Concept - At first glance it may seem shitty, but it really works bcuz its a comedy 8/10\\n\r\n5. Action - Funny, well animated pretty good 8/10 \\n\r\n6. Girl - Hot grill 10/10\\n\r\n7. Overall - Really funny show that is very nude & lewd, satisfying romance that makes you want to watch til the end, good art and a very unique concept \\n\\n\r\nHeres the stuff I DIDNT like about this show ( might contain minor spoilers )\\n\\n\r\n1. Crazy girl - That bitch got pretty annoying. Some people might like it, but I only ship the 2 main characters.\\n\r\n2. Ending - Now this ending was fantastic compared to some others, but It almost got to some romance between those two in the last episode. I guess this is just how it goes tho. Have to wait for a 2nd season.\\n\\n\r\nAll the \"bad\" things in this series are just things I dont like personally, so id definetly recommend this to everybody.                                       maybe girls wouldnt like it I dunno",

            "content": "Let's get this off the table first, this anime is dirty, raunchy, and hysterical on levels of Konosuba and Ghost Stories ENG Dub, if you dont enjoy Toilet Humor then i recommend other shows\r\nthe entire time i was watching this i was paying attention, it always kept my interest, the jokes and gestures were thrown everywhere they possibly could have been but it never felt like it was forced for the sake of comedy, it felt genuinely like the characters were just interacting and talking, it didn't come to feel like the second season of Dagashi Kashi where it felt dry, forced and fell shortcomedy wise compared to the second season, it was just a part of the dialogue and how the characters went about their days as raging perverts.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is next to non existent, lets be honest, the only forming of a story there is is a slight love story and enough to keep the plot flowing and give small meaning to the flow of events, it's much like an Idol anime or other School Life anime in where there isn't really a story underlying, it's just the characters going about their days with something different thrown in as an event every episode, this isn't necessarily a bad thing as an anime like this doesn't need a story on the level of something like Ano Hana, Patema, or other very story based and oriented works, but it cant be rated high in the story aspect because there isn't much of a story to rate\\n\\n\r\nas for the art, i didn't personally see any bad quality animation or back grounds, such as faces becoming distorted, etc etc. it wasn't beautiful on levels of Ancient Magus but it wasn't flawed either, there were also nice touches thrown in for actions, such as when Otome is drawing or the scene on the bridge with the reflections of the water being thrown/shadows moving on the faces, all in all the art and animation felt very consistent and entertaining, it added a little to the humor in some situations just because of how the scene was done\\n\\n\r\nSound wise i enjoyed the effects and BGM where i noticed it, but where the sound gets a 10 from me is the Voice Acting, the english dub was phenomenal save for a few voices that felt like they didn't belong to that specific character, the VA's were very clearly having fun with their lives, the expressions felt genuine and well placed, the laughs and other small touches as to how the line is delivered make a very large difference in how the line comes across and i feel the VA's and Dub Crew did a fantastic job picking the right lines and laying them out correctly to get the jokes, mood, and emotion across where needed, the OST was good aswell, i didn't enjoy the opening as much but the ending definitely grows on you and i found myself bopping to it between episodes\\n\\n\r\nthe characters themselves did feel a little bland which is to be expected, there wasn't much in the way of growth and they weren't very deep characters to begin with because it wasn't needed for the point of the show, the interactions and conversations between the characters however were well placed and carried this element up, they felt like genuine conversations between friends with genuine jokes and material, the conversations and flow was well written and again the VA's did an excellent job delivering it to make everything feel real\\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoyment, i loved every second of this show, i was always paying attention and very few times did i find myself without a smile from the jokes or the fun animation, i was constantly laughing and giggling and had to binge this as soon as i started it because i couldn't get enough, i enjoyed this more than most story based movies or anime that are meant to keep you invested in the plot and characters at all times, and again this is due to the Dubbing being done near perfectly, i couldn't get enough of the characters being themselves and plotting for the next SOX scheme\\n\\n\r\nall in all i'd give this an 8/10 for the pure amount of enjoyment i got out of it, the animation and still art was nicely done with touches thrown in every so often that add to the humor or excitement in a scene, the VA's were very clearly having fun with their roles and their lines, i was constantly smiling from jokes and the character interactions, it was a well made show that lived up to it's title of Dirty Jokes",

Well, it's easy to say that anime has a knack for over-exaggeration, but this particular piece of work really takes the cake when it comes to lunacy and daring sexual exploits.\r\nThere's a lot I enjoyed and a lot that left me quite disturbed. This is in no way an anime to watch with your family. They really push the perverted meter as far as they can without coming off as mature content. Wait... that's a bit incorrect, because you definitely would FEEL all the sex jokes and sexual reference, which are strongly implied (I mean it.It's like sex without sex).\\n\\n\r\nNow, in light of the above, this isn't a bad anime overall. In fact, it had moments where I couldn't stop laughing my arse off. It also had moments where you'd think, \"Whoever thought of something like this, at one point in his life, must have been extremely sexually repressed.\" \\n\\n\r\nThe characters took it for me, one above everyone else: Anna. Oh my God, her transforming from an innocent, high-raising girl, to a full blown ignorant pervert was a completely shock to my system. Watching her chasing after Okuma for his \"Love Nectar\" was both hilarious and cringe-worthy.\\n\\n\r\nCurrently, that's all  I can think of on the matter. My mind is still trying to come to terms with what my eyes saw.",

            "content": "Okay, I just can't believe how much I enjoyed this anime.\r\nThe overall plot of Shimoneta is that society has cleaned up its lewdness. People are restricted from saying curse words, dirty jokes, or anything deemed inappropriate. It also means porn is illegal and if someone gets caught with a porn magazine or saying anything lewd and/or cursing will be detained by the Decency Squad and sent to jail. People are forced to wear PM trackers so that the government can be alerted by someone who says or does anything lewd, but doesn't have the capability to ID them until they reach wear the signal iscoming from. Our male main protagonist is named Tanukichi Okuma who has just entered a high school and joins the student council. But before his first day he runs into the lewd terrorist named Blue Snow, a female girl who wears panties on her face and wears nothing but a bed sheet over her naked body. This girl is later revealed as Ayame Kajou, also a member of the student council. She later forces him to join SOX, an organization who fights for returning society to the way it was before. From there on they devise plans to expose lewdness to their school and hopefully change the world.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all very unique. Okuma is the son of the dirty joke terrorist Zenjuro, who was arrested and is now in prison. After that he would clean up his attitude despite still liking dirty jokes. He was inspired by Anna Nishikinomiya, the president of the student council who is the daughter of Sophia and Masukage who were the ones part of this movement to clean up moral, any further details would spoiler the fun you have with this character. Next is and finally is Ayame who is the leader of SOX and the queen of the dirty jokes. She basically is the brains of SOX and can't go 30 seconds without saying a dirty joke,but she is highly entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThis is really fun, but then you get to episode 4 and you're just staring at your computer laughing saying \"What the fuck am I watching?\". In addition, the concept of sex ed is basically nonexistent. Now I'm not going to lie, but when high school students don't know how humans reproduce then it become a big issue.\\n\\n\r\nShimoneta is a fun, entertaining, and hilarious show. It does get ridiculous, but that's to be expected in a show about erotic terrorism. The voice acting is solid especially Miyu Matsuki, the voice of Anna. In addition to that you will not get that ending theme out of your head, because it's just that good. So i'm giving Shimoneta an 8/10 and giving it a high recommendation to watch at your own leisure.",

            "content": "\"A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesn't Exist\" \r\nShimoseka does an outstanding job of focusing on its theme.\r\nIf you're wandering around MAL and you stumbled upon this anime, don't dismiss it because of the cover or your preconceptions.  Shimoseka is a very unique show.  In the world of Shimoseka sexual morality is becoming enforced physically. People are wearing regulators where their speech is monitored so they can't say dirty words like p*nis or v*gina for fear of incarceration.  In this world, there's a terrorist organization that goes by the name of SOX (the O is a censor mark injapan but it's pronounced - socks) led by Blue Snow.  She goes around perpetuating sexuality, and believes that the freedom to have whatever adult tastes you want belong to you and shouldn't be judge by some govermental standard, and our protagonist gets involved with her through ways I wont spoil. \\n\\n\r\nShimoseka is a hyperbolic representation of our current society.  Sexuality is a taboo matter, and in our society where conformity and guidelines permeate every facet of everything, sexuality is uncontrollable and therefore a problem.  While the show takes a lighthearted approach to the situation, it's true that the government has intervened in the most private of aspects in people's lives.\\n\\n\r\nShimoseka asks the viewer to take a look at their own sexuality by having watered down versions of most sexual fetishes. All of it's played for laughs since the show still wants to be fun, however; it wants you to be introspective about your sexuality.  The protagonist is an average guy, but even he has sexual biases, and in the end isn't that a big part of growing up left unspoken. Discovering what you're interested in sexually?\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the pacing of the story, the show goes from story arc to story arc very fluidly.  All of it ties together well, and the characters grow throughout the show.  \\n\\n\r\nI WAS NEVER BORED.\\n\\n\r\nNo episode bored me. Every line, and every location needed to exist and was interesting to hear.  The characters weren't one dimensional. You couldn't stick them into a stereotypical cliches.  They were fully fleshed out human beings with goals and quirks, but the quirks didn't define them.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was fantastic. The backgrounds merged well with the characters, and the animation never dipped in quality.\\n\\n\r\nThe audio never interfered with the story and in fact brought it along quite nicely. I have no objections. \\n\\n\r\nNow the fanservice is still technically there.  It is exploring sexuality after all, so be warned.\\n\\n\r\nI would honestly recommend this show to any anime fans that has any tolerance towards slightly perverse situations.  The perversion isn't even all that high to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nShimoseka is a show that opens the closet that you keep closed out of embarrassment and asks you to embrace everything inside as it's a part of you while taking you through a fun ride full of self-discovery and overall acceptance.\\n\\n\r\nThis show isn't Girls Bravo or whats another dumb fanservice anime... Akikan or whatever. \\n\\n\r\nShimoseka is a tasteful but distateful show. It's mature but immature, and even though that sounds impossible, I can definitely say it's a unique and worthwhile experience.",

Great dystopian setting, great variety of characters design and personality, characters have love triangles and group dynamics.\r\nI saw episode 1 and I was immediately impressed by the depiction of teenage sexual ignorance. Some cheap dirty jokes were a little difficult to understand since they \"came out so fast\" and they were censored, but I thought their medium for spreading sex ed was comical and brilliant.\r\nHowever, as the series progressed, each episode had lessnew material. Character concepts and sexual education peaked in episode 1 and were exhausted by 4. The anime became about dramatic reactions, fetishes, cheap sex jokes, and shock value which really reaches it's height in episodes 4 and 5. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, Fine anime, I just hoped it would be more educational, for more progress on the main plot, and for a climax.",

That the world didn't have any lewd material to go around?  To answer that question, we have \"Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsuna Sekai\", or in translation, \"A boring world where the concept of dirty jokes doesn't exist.\"\\n\\n\r\nStory: Shimoneta (I am definitely shorthanding this name cause it is too goddamn long) as mentioned before, takes place in a world that is completely devoid of any sort of lewd material.  Indecencies such as those have become outlawed and are enforced to the extent that the people are even dogcollared so if they even so much as say a dirty word, they will get arrested on the spot.  Our story follows our main protagonist Tanukichi as he enters a clean high school with the prospect of living a clean life devoid of any dirty jokes....then he meets a girl wearing nothing but a white cloth and is forced to become an eroterrorist by the use of blackmail.  (What fun.)\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, Shimoneta is a very balls to the wall, hard hitting show that won't let you climax until it wants you to.  (I am so sorry, but this is going to be the review, kind of.)  Revolving around the antics of the eroterrorist organizations \"SOX\", Shimoneta follows the acts of \"eroterrorism\" by our main protagonists, trying to educate the now innocent public on what it means to be perverted and the benefits of pervertedness, facing all kinds of challenges like recruitment, other terrorist organizations, and well, the law since they are technically breaking the law by doing what they're doing.  Every week they do something new that adds something to their overall goal of bringing humanity back to the idea pervertedness.  \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy of Shimoneta is very much on the \"dirty joke\" end of the comedic spectrum.  Actually, no, it goes full force into dirty joke territory.  Much like Seitokai Yakuindomo, Shimoneta barely goes a single minute without cracking some kind of euphemism, lewd movement, using other objects as dirty things, or just your average dirty joke cause that's what this show is all about.  It's very heavily prominent in this show, but it doesn't take away from it simply because that is what the show is about.  If anything, it adds to it.  However, that's not all the comedy is about, but we'll get to that later.\\n\\n\r\nHowever there are a couple things that Shimoneta doesn't really do all that well in.  As a primarily comedic show, Shimoneta goes into some rather serious moments in the show which clash with the show's normally lighthearted nature.  It goes into this final arc at the end of the show which while adds conflict, doesn't really feel like Shimoneta.  In addition, the final episode of Shimoneta doesn't really feel like a conclusion as so much as an OVA or extra story.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Very...unique story concept\\n\r\n+/- Perverted comedy  (Good only if you're into that)\\n\r\n-  Odd tone shifts sometimes\\n\r\n-  OVA-like ending\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Much like its story, Shimoneta has a lot characters that fall into the category of balls to the wall craziness.  \\n\\n\r\nFirst, we have Okuma Tanukichi, the main protagonist of the story.  As a boy who wishes to do nothing more an a healthy life, Tanukichi is suddenly thrown into the situation where he comes into contact with \"Blue Snow\", the eroterrorist leader of the organization known as SOX. By use of blackmail, he is forced to help her commit all sorts of ero crimes such as distributing lewd pictures, teaching the innocent high schoolers about sex, and using himself as bait for...various purposes.  The ironic thing about his character is the fact that while he tries to abstain from dirty jokes as he tries to play the straight man in the comedy duo of the series, he in fact gets a kick out of them and continues to participate in the activities that SOX commits.  \\n\\n\r\nThen we have our main female protagonist, Ayame Kajou.  As the leader of SOX and advocator for dirty jokes, Kajou plays the \"funny guy\" in the comedy duo of the series.  Mostly cracking jokes every thirty seconds every time she's on-screen, she is the person that gives our main character daily stress and creates the general comedy of the show.  For the most part, Kajou herself doesn't really change through the whole series.  Contrary to Okuma who slowly changes when accepting his love for dirty jokes, Kajou stays fairly static throughout the entire show.  (Well, aside from her personal nervousness for being seen in a dirty fashion.)\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have Nishinomiya Anna, the student council president who advocates for the healthy lifestyle that the world in Shimoneta promotes.  While she fully represents the world that she lives in, halfway towards the series she...changes.  While Anna isn't wholeheartedly involved in the series as much as Kajou or Tanukichi are, Anna adds to the show and makes it far better by branding herself with a very specific kind of comedy which as a results, creates this very...interesting aura for the show that for me, creates some of the most memorable things about this show.  (Not even the ocean could quench that thirst...)\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of cast is comprised of other characters that have varying importance to the series.  There are the more important characters to the series such as Saotome and Kosuri who serve as the other members to the SOX organization and Goriki, a literal human gorilla who serves to help satisfy any fujoshis who are watching the show.  In addition, there are the lesser known characters that help with the story progression of the series, with little importance beyond that.  These side characters do help bring their own form of craziness into the show and do help with instilling a sense of memorabilia into the show.  This cast is unique to the point that they will hold you down and not stop violating your mind until you KNOW who they are.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Very memorable cast\\n\r\n+ Unique characteristics for a good number of them\\n\r\n-  Characters do stay very one-sided throughout the show's entirety\\n\\n\r\nArt: Shimoneta was produced by J.C. staff and as such is fairly standard for its production.  Aside from the more risque sections of the show, Shimoneta stays mostly on a standard style on animation and there really isn't much for it beyond that.  The colors are standard, there's no absurdly large amount or lack of detail, and there aren't any dramatic changes in quality.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, since this is an ecchi show, we will have to talk about the ecchiness that this show has.  As this is a show that is very blatant about what it is, showing us what it has and dangling its lewdness in our face, the show very often uses a specific type of comedic censorship where they have little portraits of the characters covering any sort of exposed (or erect) body parts on the characters.  They also utilizing pixelation, many loopholes in order to show phallic or other dirty figures, as well as lots and lots and lots of pantsu.  (Hey, this is a dirty show, they use a lot of dirty things to get their point through.)  Since the ecchi is quite overbearing and is excessive to a comedic degree (kind of the point), it may be a turn off for some viewers.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Standard art style\\n\r\n+/-  Lots and lots and lots of ecchi material (depends on how you can handle ecchi.)\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OP and ED for Shimoneta are both average at best.  While they both portray a superhero style of music with the brass and the usage of cacophony, there's not really much variation.  Sure they're decent tracks as they're not really jarring to listen to and add to the comedy that the show wishes to make, but the lack of variation or sound really didn't make it a very memorable soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Decent soundtrack\\n\r\n-  Not very memorable\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: Shimoneta was a show that when I first saw it instantly earned a big \"WTF\" from me because the concept was so ridiculous, it was something I knew that I had to see.  So, after being properly violated by that with not only my morals corrupted but also the way I perceive everything around me, what are my thoughts on the show?\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy this show?\\n\\n\r\nYes.  While it may not be the best show to come out of this season because it is very one-sided in its presentation and the way it delivers any sort of comedy, it was still a HUGE blast to watch.  The comedy was enjoyable to me on account of its complete and utter ridiculousness (plus I enjoy this kind of thing) and I was thoroughly satisfied with watching it week after week.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I enjoy about this show?\\n\\n\r\nDuring the last few episodes where the show sort of went into a more \"serious\" mood with eroterrorism that was kind of like actual terrorism, I wasn't exactly pleased with that.  The comedy of the show disappeared almost entirely and the tone shift left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.  Plus, I was not happy about being scarred about seeing a man in women's underwear.  That image will haunt me for the rest of my life...\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIf you want something to watch that requires you to turn your brain off, and you don't mind ecchi at all, then I would say this show fits the bill.  Shimoneta is a show that I would suggest only people that can handle an excessive amount of dirty language to watch this show because that is purely what it's about.  (Also, make sure to watch this with headphones.  They do lewd sceaming too.)  Shimoneta isn't necessarily a masterpiece but it is still a fun show, so if you want to give it a chance, go for it.  Go hard or don't go in at all!",

But there is an underlying complexity to this.\r\nLet's start from the beginning:\r\nShimoneta takes place ten years in the future where legislation has been passed to illegalize all pornographic material and profanity to promote morality.You do have to kind of suspend your disbelief for a bit to let that premise to sink in. But once you do, you see what problems that would bring.\r\nEarly on the anime demonstrates the dangers of having pubescent teenagers who are uneducated to sex.\r\nFalse information gets spread and children have no way of coping with theirurges. Not only that but \"erotic terrorist\" organizations begin popping up in protest. Most are peaceful but there are many who aren't. \\n\\n\r\nWe follow S.O.X. a newly formed organization made up of a daughter of an arrested politician who enjoys dirty jokes, the son of an \"erotic terrorist\" who was arrest about a decade before the events of the show and an prodigal artist student who feels like she has been limited by her inability to draw the human body. Their usual operations consist of distributing pornographic material, yelling swear words and drawing depictions of genitalia.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the latter half of the show they make a heavy emphasis on the difference between peaceful protests and violent uprisings. Which seems to be the true core of the story.\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this show.",

First chapters did seem like this anime would be a really good parody-like war against the unreal amount of censorship nowadays.. I mean, it IS a very controversial topic.. wether is okay or not, wether is sane or not, which are the boundries of porn and violence material.. are they good for society? even if you're older than 18 (or 21) is it really okay for us to access to any distorted material we want? I do believe tho, even if there were orshould be boundries, you can not just show someone a chocolate cake and then regret it and tell them \"I'm better giving you this lettuce leaf, it isn't sweet but you can eat it as well, it's healthier than the chocolate cake\" everything can be a way of expression and no expression path should be left out nor censored.. \\n\\n\r\nNot going way further about censorship, the main idea was really a nice thing, it's like the topic everyone wanted to talk about somehow but nobody knew how to or just no one did as accurately as shimoneta did on its first episodes... until around episode 3 this show seemed amazing to me, afterwards I just watched it out of the hope of it getting better.. which did not happen.. same old jokes, fun to me because I'm immune to bad humor but I can tell they got boring.. about story's resolution it got to a very poor point (I'm giving the story a 3 of poor because of the main idea, instead of its deserved pathetic 1)\\n\\n\r\nArt is \"good\" 7 because it's ok and animation is clean enough. Sound is 7 as well for same reasons. Characters are 7, even when they didnt really develop well enough and I got personally really disappointed about Anna's particular character development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is \"7\" because if you aren't too harsh it's just an \"okay\" comedy with a good background idea. Overall is \"fair\" only because its good point is too good and I feel bad for giving it its deserved \"mediocre\" 5.\\n\\n\r\nDo recommend it, will make you laugh and first chapters are really nice.",

In the form of a glass filled with her pussy juices for him to drink...\\n\\n\r\nIt's ridiculously sexual and ridiculously ridiculous, but it's attached to a character who has no notion of what sexuality really is or what her feelings and bodily reactions are actually about. It's funny and sexual but not mean-spirited or perverse.\\n\\n\r\nAt no point does it feel like the characters desire physical relationships in the pornographic sense, they just have a sexuality they want to learn how to express. \\n\r\nShimoneta is nothing but a show about how teenagers will find ways to become sexual and having lighthearted fun about it. \\n\\n\r\nDo the shitty puns tire? Kinda. And the show as a whole offers very little in terms of plot or ideology, except that sex is good.\\n\\n\r\nArt or sound deserves little mention too, although I liked the opening theme quite a bit and I think the art at least managed to make the girls sexy, or that they physically resembled their personalities.\\n\\n\r\nBut even if it is a cheap reason to talk about sex and make an endless train of crappy puns roll over the viewer, Shimoneta really gets a pass because it feels completely earnest in what it does, both with the sex talk and with the sex acts(in this anime those who talk about sex don't have sex and those who don't talk about sex are the horniest, most sexually agressive beings ever born).\\n\\n\r\nFor all the fucked up things Anna Nishikinomiya did, I still found her endearing more than threatening, despite the numerous rape attempts. Okuma's naivete or Saotome's obsession with drawing anything her dirty mind sees or imagines gave me the same feeling: it's stupid, but it's endearingly stupid, and overall Shimoneta was an endearing watch, if not a high quality anime.",

            "content": "For a long time, i have been searching a decent ecchi anime with a good comedy and that would particularly enjoy me, despise many animes that have those annoying fanservices...untill i find Shimoneta. Just like Ansatsu Kyoushitsu, Shimoneta have a kind of \"original\" plot yet is not so original as you think is since is something you  can kind of expect in a ecchi show but it still can entertain. Well, lets go with our review and you will see the point.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nSixteen years after the \"Law for Public Order and Morals in Healthy Child-Raising\" banned coarse language in the country, Tanukichi Okuma enrollsin the country's leading elite public morals school and is soon invited into the Anti-Societal Organization (SOX) by its founder, Ayame Kajou. As a member blackmailed into joining by Ayame, Tanukichi ends up taking part in obscene acts of terrorism against the talented student council president Anna (for whom Tanukichi has a crush on).\\n\\n\r\nThe story as i said is \"original\" but...just in some aspects because the fact a plot of a main character go find a childhood female character in a school is more than a typical anime ecchi clich\u00e9 thing YET the story is a bit more different, which is a good because at least something is going on, rather a male character going with girls with no reason. And since shimoneta is a comedy animes, is fair to put some kind of \"stupid\" things aswell in the plot, like a super-hero which fight for bring back the ero-jokes but is what shines in this anime, can be stupid but somehow genius aswell.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art is good. Don't expect something animation full of details in the face, hair, colors etc. Is the animation you expect in a ecchi anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nSound is also very catchy. The OP and ED are Ok(prefer the ed though). The OSTs are also very good, they are different type of symphonies, melodies, vocal themed soundtracks and many other types. Is a great variety, many people will or not try find those soundtracks. Thats depends of the taste.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nCharacters is OK. There is a great variety YET stereotyped characters in this anime that you always find in other ecchi comedy animes like the trap, the pevert girl, the male leader in the confusions, the male that have something for the mc, the jealous girl etc. What is the difference? the focus in the anime is different. There characters you will particularly like because of the comedic scenes in the anime, because they are really funny.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nThats about taste. Don't watch Shimoneta if you expect something serious. But if you are fan of prison school or seitokai yakuindomo, then this anime is perfect for you. You will enjoy for the comedy....the confusion that the characters are in and....the ecchi aswell...but thats just it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nShimoneta is actually good. It does have a different story....or concept for the events, which is actually different than most of this genre of anime. It does explains the why of most the facts, different of a anime which don't have any sense and just give protagonism to the main character. Those who are fan of ecchi, go on and watch, its for you, those who want to take a break of serious anime and watch something for laugh and entertain a bit, you can watch but don't expect you will enjoy  because thats taste, but i can assure you will laugh in some scenes.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Good Variety of Iconic Characters\\n\r\n+Good Comedy\\n\r\n+Decent OSTs\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Few parts feels a bit rushed and unexplained.\\n\\n",

            "content": "There are some anime that you watch and enjoy very much at the time, some that you can get into there and then and think at the end of each episode 'fuck yeah, I love this show!'. Then, retrospectively, you look back after finishing with a more objective eye and come to almost a completely different conclusion; something like 'Actually, I wonder why I liked this show so much...'. Shows like Akame Ga Kill, Highschool DxD, Elfen Lied, and Angel Beats and such all seemed to fall under that umbrella for me for various reasons, there was something about the way they presented themselves whichleft such a strong impression that you overlooked a potential mess of a story, like that video of the black and white basketball players where you had to count how many passes were made but as you do so you completely miss the fact that a panda bear walked on the court and started dancing in the middle, it takes your attention away so much that something which should be obvious as all Hell flies right over your head. Either that, or you noticed that everything is a complete mess but something about the show makes you just not care at all.\\n\r\nShimoneta was a similar experience with me, the reason for it was simply because it was entertaining. It was there to entertain, it entertained, and all it intended to do was entertain. Nothing more, nothing less. I think that was one of the main points people who disliked this show found bad about it, they were lured in by the plot of this being a world ruled by censorship so heavy that people physically don't even know how to reproduce anymore and expected a show that would kick modern day rampant censorship in the balls and say 'Fuck you' to SJW bitching and safe spaces and video game censorship and all that shit, only to be very sorely let down by the fact that this show just turned into a string of sex jokes. So, yes, the idea that you were going to be in for a very clever story designed to promote a worthy cause and receiving in return a story with a plot as deep as spilled water and no revolutionary purpose besides an excuse to spew lewd comedy could be majorly off-putting. That said, if you know what you're getting into, or at the very least don't go into this expecting much in ways of a clever plot, you can enjoy this show very much so if it's your type of humour.\\n\\n\r\nSo, should you watch it? Yes, if you enjoy dirty humour, you should. It's a pretty crazy ride and you'll probably enjoy it as it goes. If you're expecting anything intellectual or hate crude comedy then this show is not for you at all. I would very much like to stress again that despite the premise being interesting in its own right, it's not built upon from an intellectual standpoint, but from a comedic one; so come into this show with the expectation of comedy and drop everything else or you just won't like it, plain and simple.\\n\r\nWatching it censored or not is up to you. I think most people found the censoring funny, reinforcing the humour of the overall concept, but personally I found it to be a sad irony and looked up an uncensored version. All in preference, depending on if you see any comedy in it.\\n\\n\r\nFull review ahead. Be mindful of spoilers!\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\r\nI have nothing to really say in this area. The art was nice, the music was ok, I cannot say anything more. I cannot accuse this show of having bad art or sound at all, but it's certainly not memorable. I can't remember any scene which just popped in my head because the art grabbed me, and the only music that hooked me in at all was the ending theme. You probably won't have any complaints regarding these areas, in fact I'm pretty sure you won't, but it's definitely not going to be at the forefront of why you would ever watch this show. That's really it for this. This isn't the important part anyway, the next part is.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nNow... If there were any area I truly thought this show could have definitely improved on, then it would be its characters. This cast was quite a heavy waste of potential in my opinion, with half of the main cast not even feeling like 'main' at all, and some other potentially well developable characters we'd want to see progress kind of completely losing all their potential. Onigashira seemed like a bit of a mystery since she does seem to have a clear character who wants something different to what all other parties want, and she jumps from party to party thinking each one suited her best, only to turn back on them when they weren't to her standards. I at least found that interesting about her, but given that she just turned up halfway through the series there was little time to fully explore that without feeling forced or rushed. Saotome was pretty pointless, joining the troop for no real reason, just because the plot pulled it out of its ass, and did nothing but appear drawing porn with her mouth from then on out and doing little else. Her character was a running joke. Speaking of running jokes, Anna... Anna, one of the most beloved characters of the show stopped being a character pretty quickly. Initially she started off as being the love interest of our main protagonist due to her innocence and purity, but since kissing Okuma by accident in episode 3, she turned into a hyper sex machine. This was explained by the fact that she was SO pure and innocent that she has no clue about the difference between love and lust, and thinks that her new-found sexual desires for Okuma are actually signs of a pure and innocent love. This sounds great at first, but it never goes anywhere beyond that, she doesn't slowly start to learn about what's really going on with her, she doesn't join SOX, she doesn't go through some breakdown as she's torn between staying clean and giving in to her carnal desires; she just squirts in Okuma's face every other episode. What a waste of a potentially awesome character. People who like her don't like her as a character, they like her as a running joke, and I do too, but I can't help but feel bitter for it. Okuma himself was as disappointingly generic a character as they come. Your every day brown-haired guy with a prudish attitude who seems to want nothing to do with SOX at all but sticks with them willingly for seemingly no reason besides to go with the flow. He has a history of his Dad being a notorious dirty-joke terrorist, so between that and his love for the pure Anna, they really could have given him more depth of internal conflict; Hell, the way he showed himself in episode 1 where he pretended to be a pervert to save another guy on the train from being falsely accused was never expanded, it only happened once and all of his actions from then on out were just following Kajou's orders. He never really accomplished much either, and she ship with Kajou towards the end had near no development whatsoever because he didn't have any real character, he was just her right-hand guy and his only interaction with her was telling her to stop telling dirty jokes all the time or discussing her next scheme.\\n\r\nThere's very much room for development and if these characters really did knot up then this series would be a 9 easily. They still have the opportunity to if a second season comes out, which I really hope it does, but as far as it went so far I will openly admit it wasn't the best cast. Despite this, each character did have their own unique quirk which they brought to the story and each had their own running joke to bring to the table, so I could appreciate their existence for that much.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe premise of this show, as mentioned, is about a world in which all profanity is censored from the world to the point where you can be arrested for things you say and draw which could possibly be considered lewd and kids grow up not knowing how babies are made. In this world, there are dirty-joke terrorists who fight for the right to be free from this oppressive society and return the world to a normal state again. Our generic MC, Okuma, catches the attention of the leader of SOX, a dirty-joke terrorist called Blue Snow (Kajou) and is pretty much forced to join, and while he is somewhat aware of the existence of dirty jokes, his father being a terrorist too, he's kind of a prude as he wants to shake off the stigma of being his son and get his love interest, the pure Anna, to love him. Hilarity ensues. This show just gets more and more ridiculous by the episode, from one of out main cast screaming about dicks in the street while wearing nothing but a sheet, Anna putting her love nectar in Okuma's cookies, Gouriki x Okuma porn magazines being distributed at school, fighting a villain wrapped up in girl's white panties with his dick hanging out, it's all pretty crazy. This is what I mean. It uses its premise as an excuse to get their characters into as weird, fucked up, funny situations as it can and doesn't hit the breaks. All that happens is the situations get as chaotic as possible and if you left any serious expectations behind then you'll probably have a really fun time and your ribs might end up aching often. It's just pure frantic lewd comedy under the guise of a revolutionary anime with a defiant message. Fuck the message, watch it for the jokes. That said, don't binge it, or else the comedy will probably fade after the sittings. Not to say that every joke is the same thing on loop, but there's only so much sexual comedy you can take before you just stop caring. At least for me anyway.\\n\\n\r\nSummary:\\n\r\nI hope and pray for a season 2. This show had the makings of a really good show and was an incredibly entertaining watch, I enjoyed every second of it but I will not deny its flaws. Its cast was pretty flat and undeveloped, and the comedy could wear thin after watching in one go. The latter issue can be resolved by pacing your viewing, and the former is easily in a current position to be expanded on in a season 2. I expect this to be a show with a following second season which would massively outshine its first, but even in its own right, if you know what to expect, you can have a lot of fun with this show.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\r\n8/10. An incredibly entertaining watch which has no trouble getting me to turn a blind eye to its faults and to just enjoy the ride. While I will never deny it its faults, I can say that it was such a fun watch that I really don't care. I just wish season 2 will come along and save us from the fate of bland and undeveloped characters before I'd truly be willing to call this a great show.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nShimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai (Shimoneta from here on out because that title is ridiculously long) reminded me of a tale. It is a tale from my childhood, back when I was a spry young boy with strict parents.\r\nTheir strictness should not be underestimated. Growing up, I was disciplined to never swear. This has carried over into my adult life; I very rarely swear while out in public. (In private, however, all bets are off.) One day, we visited the family cottage. That day, I was there with my cousinsand my brother.\\n\\n\r\nProbably due to that rebellious stage of our lives, we decided that enough was enough: We were going to swear. But we were not just going to say a bunch of curse words in the living room. Instead, we decided to take our behavior to the trampoline on the side of the house. The second we got onto the trampoline, our mouths and brains started working. The jumps-to-dirty-words ratio quickly became imbalanced; the pine trees turned into scarlet oaks from all the blushing they were doing.\\n\\n\r\nOur swearing escapade eventually ended. We were never caught, but that feeling of freedom has never been matched since. And considering Shimoneta, I know now that Kajou and the rest of SOX felt exactly the same.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nShimoneta is bonkers mostly due to its unique premise. Japan, over the past few years, put forth regulations that essentially outlawed anything \u2013 and they mean anything \u2013 lewd. This includes pornography, swearing, and even drawing risqu\u00e9 images.\\n\\n\r\nThrough this unique premise, Shimoneta capitalizes on its comedy. The show teaches the citizens of Japan what sex actually is by using a couple of insects. The show saturates itself in swearing, forming sexual innuendos out of every object and situation possible. And the show makes it its mission to include as many boobs, butts, and \u201cbananas\u201d as possible to combat the censoring.\\n\\n\r\nIronically, the censorship enhances the comedy. Rather than showing genitalia, the anime cleverly uses flooded dams and nearly-exploding champagne bottles as metaphors. It is not vaginal secretions but instead \u201cLove Nectar.\u201d And Saotome does not draw the human anatomy by conventional means (i.e., using her hands and fingers). She draws using a pencil in her mouth.\\n\\n\r\nThis satire through censoring begs the question, how bad is censorship? Well, to Shimoneta, censorship is nothing short of horrible. It demonstrates that censoring speech and desires and thoughts is an Orwellian mindset that incites insanity. As the show shows, people wearing used panties like they were an outfit and people going crazy with lust since they do not understand their own feelings are the byproducts of such a messed-up society.\\n\\n\r\nYet these are the least of anyone\u2019s worries. What is truly worrisome is the loss of control. People should be free to say whatever they want, express themselves however they want, and think about whoever they want. This is what Shimoneta champions. It does so through the guise of a raunchy, sexualized anime, but the message remains the same: Censorship is horrible, and people should be free.\\n\\n\r\nTaking a step back from the theme of the show and looking at the narrative, the structure starts to weaken somewhat. There are predominantly two conflicts: SOX versus Anna\u2019s mother\u2019s new bill and SOX versus White Peak. With both conflicts, an unfortunate feeling of pointlessness occurs. Yes, SOX imparts knowledge on the masses, but stopping the bill and defeating White Peak do not lead to a reduction in censorship. Again, the point of the show is demonstrating how horrible censorship is, so when said censorship continues \u2013 despite the efforts of Kajou and the gang \u2013 the whole adventure comes off as unfulfilling.\\n\\n\r\nShimoneta also includes \u201csubplots\u201d revolving around Tanukichi\u2019s father and Kosuri\u2019s father. The word \u201csubplots\u201d was put in quotes because these are not exactly plots but rather small asides. They are never explored outright, leaving the audience to ponder what happened to or what is happening with these separate ideas. Presumably, they were or are fights against censorship, so the anime not exploring these subplots is a misstep of thematic proportions.\\n\\n\r\nThen there is the last episode which is largely unnecessary. The second-to-last episode capped off the season\u2019s troubles handily enough: The main antagonist is defeated, and Kajou is provided with a platform to make a rousing speech. Yet the anime decides to include an episode that, realistically, rehashes much of the same jokes that preceded it. Worse still, the final episode does not serve much of a purpose outside of \u201cmore Shimoneta.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIf anything, this episode simply reinforces the notion that the characters\u2019 efforts have, so far, been mostly for naught. Subsequently, the anime ends on an unfortunately sour note.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nShimoneta incorporates its censorship motif into its art. For many scenes, hand gestures, fluids, and other naughty objects are hidden behind pink hearts or round stickers featuring the characters of the show. The anime turns the censorship from unfortunate to comical, demonstrating once again its understanding of the themes and the comedy it has.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the art is lackluster. The cinematography is uninspiring, the lighting is an afterthought, and visited locations are not too detailed. Actual animation fairs a bit better. Anna going berserk \u2013 jumping, running, and fighting \u2013 and specific sequences \u2013 like Saotome creating an exorbitant amount of drawings or Kajou humping a table or the air \u2013 tend to be nicely animated throughout the season. When the anime is not focusing on Anna or those specific sequences, characters see an average amount of limb, facial, and general movement that, if nothing else, keeps the show from feeling flat.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the character designs, they are interesting to say the least. Goriki is the butt end (pun intended) of a lot of jokes involving Tanukichi and homosexual relations. More specifically, much of the pornography about him includes a \u201cbanana.\u201d So, naturally, his design is closely related to that of a gorilla.\\n\\n\r\nKosuri\u2019s character design is also interesting. She looks innocent and naive, but when she gets excited, her hair stiffens into the shape of a penis. Kajou and Tanukichi have their normal, plain designs, but their SOX outfits \u2013 a blanket for Kajou, black lingerie for Tanukichi, and panties for wearing on the head for both \u2013 contrast quite nicely. And one would be remiss in not mentioning Anna with her white hair representing her \u201cpurity,\u201d her dress which conceals her sexy figure, and the lustful, heart-shaped eyes that indicate her craziness.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt, if anyone remembers anything about Shimoneta, it is Anna. Anna is what anime would deem a \u201cyandere,\u201d a character so obsessed with another that she would resort to violence for even a glance of her dearly beloved. Her super-human strength makes it pretty easy for her to get those glances.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough she does not start off this way. In the beginning, she is characterized as the pretty, professional, and pure girl who leads the student council. After her first kiss, however, she drops the last two characteristics entirely. From that point on, Anna becomes a lecherous fiend, wanting nothing more than for Tanukichi to accept her love.\\n\\n\r\nAnna\u2019s contrast between purity and lechery demonstrates how censorship can mislead someone down an ignorant path. The contrast is also hilarious, once again satirizing the concept of censorship. Luckily, the anime continues to up the ante with her character for each episode. One moment has her trying to \u201cdock\u201d him. The next moment has her using her \u201cLove Nectar\u201d to make cookies, to fill bottles, and to create rainbows. And the moment after that one has her stuffing her face in Tanukichi\u2019s \u201creward\u201d for her. She remains a fun and purposeful character throughout the season, leaving her mark in more ways than one.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Anna, the characters see a considerable drop in execution. The next best are arguably Fuwa and Kajou, though this is only because the anime does not stumble in doing more with their characters when compared to the other members of the cast. Fuwa is an inquisitive scientist who is investigating \u201cbody melding\u201d and related behavior. She works well as a side character since that is all she is. She shows up occasionally to make a joke, to help the gang, and to impart wisdom.\\n\\n\r\nKajou is similar to Fuwa in the sense that she acts more like a supporter than being a pivotal character. She is \u201cBlue Snow,\u201d the self-proclaimed \u201cdirty joke\u201d who wants to turn this \u201cboring world where the concept of dirty jokes doesn\u2019t exist\u201d into one that is, well, normal. Interestingly, she can get embarrassed, like when she sees Tanukichi naked with his \u201cseal\u201d out or when they are walking side-by-side in nothing but their undergarments. Kajou was influenced by her father, but, outside of the first episode, this seemingly important detail is never brought up again. Instead, her main role is to inspire Tanukichi to discover what it is that he really wants to do and to be.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Tanukichi, he is arguably one of the worst characters in the anime. As the straight man of the group \u2013 always getting frustrated at the other characters for acting so immature \u2013 he slowly opens up to the possibility that he wants to be someone like Kajou: a person who knows himself or herself completely (which includes being lewd). What is strange, then, is that he continually gets annoyed and fed up with Kajou\u2019s remarks and the rest of SOX\u2019s behavior despite liking their mentality. Worse still is how his past centered on his father, who was similar to Kajou both in her actions and her assuredness of self, hardly influences his life.\\n\\n\r\nKosuri is best described as a lesser Tanukichi. She is sweet yet conniving, looking to always cause mayhem. She also has daddy issues that go largely unexplored \u2013 this only serves to harm her character. However, unlike Tanukichi, she is influenced by her father\u2019s actions in the sense that she feels that his rebellion is not enough.\\n\\n\r\nThis is why she joins SOX, believing that they are more progressive in their thinking. Near the end of the season, she betrays SOX to help White Peak (believing that he is even more progressive), but she soon realizes she was mistaken. \u201cSoon\u201d meaning \u201cless than an episode\u201d because she defects back to SOX without much fuss, serving to make her betrayal just a convenient move to prolong the plot.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the characters, Saotome initially has a slump in her painting abilities that she is combating, but after joining SOX, she does little else besides provide spurts of comedy. Goriki is essentially a non-character except during the bus predicament. And Tsukimigusa, despite having an interesting and relevant conflict revolving around identity, does not have his character expounded on. Even the main villains, Sophia (Anna\u2019s mother) and White Peak, are weak: They are either barely around or hardly impacting, turning them into unworthy antagonists.\\n\\n\r\nIt also does not help that themes connecting the cast together are nearly nonexistent. There are remnants of these themes, such as the idea of finding one\u2019s identity (which could be interpreted as discovering one\u2019s self sexually) and the coincidental, influential fathers (for Kajou, Tanukichi, and Kosuri, as well as arguably Anna, given her father\u2019s position). But, again, these themes do not have depth because the anime almost never set aside the necessary time to delve into them.\\n\\n\r\nCollectively, the cast of Shimoneta is sadly subpar in their overall execution.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nShimoneta capitalizes on its censorship once more through its sound effects. Rather than having Kajou (she is the main perpetrator) speak aloud dirty words in a regular fashion, the anime bleeps out said words with squishy noises, bells, and vibrations. Per usual, this satirical censorship boosts the execution of the show further.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the original soundtrack, the best tracks happen to be the character-oriented ones for Anna and Fuwa. The angelic singer that accompanies Anna\u2019s advances makes them that much more comical. The ominous track that follows Anna during her malicious moments ups the suspense. And Fuwa\u2019s foreign track coincides with her need to understand that which is foreign to her. The other tracks consist of sad trumpets and victorious guitars that, while not as iconic or as impressive as Anna\u2019s and Fuwa\u2019s tracks, do their job of fitting the anime well-enough.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the all-important opening and ending tracks, the OP for Shimoneta is silly because of how serious it tries to be. The orchestral organization, the various vocalists, and the triumphant tone contrast amazingly with the visuals, the context, and the lyrics. (\u201cWe\u2019ll reach the climax stylishly!\u201d and \u201cUnsheathe and thrust with your mighty Sexcalibur!\u201d to recite a few.) Combined with its catchiness, the OP manages to be a relatively strong track.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED is even stronger than the OP. It is an extremely catchy track, one filled with a funky beat and dancing characters. The track itself is fun, but the lyrics \u2013 with words hiding in words and the play-on-words with \u201ccunning linguist\u201d \u2013 are once again the highlight. The chanting of \u201cS-O-X\u201d further adds to the comedic value of the track. Overall, the ED is a hilarious track that perfectly fits within the confines of Shimoneta.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, voice acting performances within the anime are grand in quality. Miu Matsuki (may she rest in peace) as Anna was wonderful, giving the purely psycho girl a refined and sexy voice that fit the character to a tee. Satomi Arai as Otome was likewise wonderful due to the rough voice she used for the small doujinshi artist. And Saori Gotou as Fuwa continues the wonderfulness with a tired, quiet way of speaking.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI am a fan of swearing and sex for comedic purposes (probably due to my aforementioned upbringing). Meaning, when this anime provided both as a single package, I was more than pleased. Every innuendo was funny, and each sexually-charged escapade put a smile on my face.\\n\\n\r\nBut I had the most fun whenever Anna was present; she was easily the best part of the anime for me. She was cute and sexy and attractive, but she was also incredibly hilarious in her yandere ways. Her getting jealous of other girls that were near Tanukichi, her chasing after Tanukichi with a pair of metal clamps, and her reacting so powerfully to anything Tanukichi said or did always made me laugh.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters were funny, too. Kajou was often the one spouting lewdness, so she was always welcome to have on screen. Fuwa, while usually resorting to the same tactic of \u201capproach a person near the crotch region while asking a question using euphemisms,\u201d was comedic in her own right. And Kosuri had her moments, too, like when she entered her innocent mode or when she was slamming her head on a milk carton that was in Tanukichi\u2019s lap to make it look as if she were ejaculating from her (penis) hair.\\n\\n\r\nEven the running gag with Binkan-chan was funny. She was the extra character with the two, small twin-tails in her hair. She was usually a bystander, reacting to SOX\u2019s shenanigans in an adorable manner which consequently made me chuckle a lot.\\n\\n\r\nMy main issue entertainment-wise is the last quarter or so of Shimoneta. I was not a fan of White Peak; I thought he was too weird. And since the anime focused more on him and drama and action, that meant less time spent on Anna and the other characters and the comedy. So while the characters and the gags provided a lot fun throughout the season, the anime was not able to remain completely entertaining from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nShimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai does not have a memorable cast or a powerful plot or a beautiful artistic direction. What this anime does have is a wacky setting, strong music, and lots of entertainment. At the minimum, this anime, those kids on the trampoline, and most everyone else can agree on an identical idea: censorship blows.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, unique premise, strong comedy, and an interesting theme on censorship, but the narrative\u2019s pointlessness, the unexplored subplots, and the unnecessary final episode cannot be ignored\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Fine, censorship is smartly used for comedy, below average artistic direction, and about average actual animation, as well as good character designs\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, besides Anna, Fuwa, and Kajou, the cast is either handled poorly or used irregularly, and the weak themes on identity and father figures further accentuate the subpar cast\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, censorship noises further add to the comedy, good OP, great ED, nice OST, above average VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, Anna is amazing, and the other characters are funny, too, but White Peak was lame, and more of him meant less of everything else\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

The idea of a sexually outrageous terrorist group protesting an absurd moral law and code is as funny and entertaining as it is original and unique. It has its moments that are borderline hentai, but they provide a censored version, the uncensored one has a moderate amount of censors though as well. However....the ending is a bit lackluster. Overall, I wouldn't miss out on this, even as someone who avidly avoids ecchi at almost all costs, I suggestit. If you like a bit of dirty humor, revolution and rebelliousness, a wee bit of romance, and just overall good content. This is an anime to provide that, just wish they could put out a second season already.",

            "content": "This anime is on a whole new level, when I first saw Shimoneta, I thought it was just going to be a ecchi mess. But I was suprised to see that it only had a few elements of nudity or profanity. You only really see about 3 of the 12 episodes actaully include nudity, which to me is a big deal, I hate anime when they include more porn than the plot.\r\nAnyway, if you dont know the story, a male high school student goes to a new high school so he can admire the headmaster,but is stopped by a \"terrorist\" who wants to put anend to PM's, a device that is put around the neck and wrists of Japanese citizens that can sensor all types of things dedicated around porn and slang terms. (Its also a phone and alarm clock, but who cares.) They exist because it showed that without porn the students can pay more attention to school, and will be able to shape japan for the future. The high school student is forced to join the organisation known as S.O.X, and has to try and ambush the headmasters and headmasters mothers plans, and let dirty jokes be said freely. It sounds pretty cool, right?\\n\\n\r\nThe story develops over time, and there is also alot of character development. The comedy just keeps getting better with every episode, too. Its also the one of the animes I have watched this season that didnt have a giant \"fuck you\" at the end, it was an outstading closure, and I hope someday there will be another season. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like comedy in anime, its probably the best out there from 2015.",

            "content": "This show is a healthy balance of exactly what you'd expect, and an interestingly fresh take on the ecchi genre. Before getting into my review, just know that this is a perverted comedy, but it is not only focused on physics-defying boobs for its shtick. Everything is fair game in this preposterous anime, and you'll likely never look at bananas the same way again...\r\nStory: 7\r\nSo underneath the heavy-handed ecchi entertainment of the series, there was a lovely bit of satire going on as well (NOTE: not masterfully done, just enough to be interesting.) Given Japan's heavily conservative and collectivist culture stereotype, the premise of thisshow suggests \"what happens if this was taken to a comedic extreme?\" \\n\r\nThis series gives itself a thoroughly (if absurd) set of rules to follow, and then makes ample use of building the plot around it. For example, wrist bracelets can measure hand strokes, so no one can draw smut any more, and as a result, a genius character learns to draw with her mouth. Funny, ridiculous, and something to obviously not be taken seriously. This underlying satire of conservative values destroying human interaction might be a little heavy-handed, but given how break-neck quick the series is as a comedy, it just sort of works. It's not brilliant, and perhaps would have done better if it did try to make a bolder statement, but as strictly an entertaining comedy, this was a solid 8 for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nNothing specifically worth mentioning here. The art is fine, gets the job done, etc. My only real issue, actually, is that the censoring on the show works against the point they might've been trying to make, and as a result, it is a little overkill. While every ecchi series ever will generally make use of a curiously placed chair, or stray beam of light to cover things up, the abundance of physical innuendo and gesturing makes a large bulk of the show bombarded with censoring. Still, a well made work, fairly average. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nI gave sound such a low score simply because I think there was too much lost in translation. Innuendo is heavily influenced by factors independent to the country of origin, and I assume more than half of the jokes made were way off base (they often don't seem to make sense whatsoever going by the subtitles. Often scenes just had the voice-actors screaming out body parts at random, and this kind of goes against the premise of a group looking to reintroduce dirty jokes into the world. Swearing is not a dirty joke, and while perhaps Crunchyroll is to blame (their subtitles are notoriously disliked in many circles) I just think this is a series that needed a better (larger) time dedicated to getting the subtitles right. I know this is not specifically a sound issue, but I imagine this is the best place to voice the complaint.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7.\\n\\n\r\nYou will love all the characters for the same reasons you were annoyed at the last ecchi characters, and you'll hate the same character types you hated before. There is not much innovation. Honestly, the only fun relationship really present was the light-hearted romance between the main characters (surely not original, but well written) and that of Fuwa. While the detached science nerd is nothing new (in western OR eastern media, mind you) her character was nonetheless hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I give it an 8 for it being just entertaining enough to keep me laughing more than wincing (although there was plenty of wincing). The show often seemed to not know what kind of comedy it wanted to be, but was not varied enough in its representation of comedy to be considered a full on parody of many tropes/cliches, like some ecchi have attempted. Regardless of this though, you still come to like the characters (at least, well... maybe the 2 main characters) and you'll likely laugh if you approach ecchi as casual comedic entertainment. I honestly think I like this series as much as I did because it never fully crossed over into being a \"large tit/dumb characters\" cliche that populate the ecchi genre.\\n\r\nIt was pretty equal opportunity when it came to jokes revolving around body parts, and it made itself known VERY quickly that it knew it was an absurd series. It did not take itself too seriously, nor did it refuse to try putting any spirit or originality into its writing. I honestly found it pretty entertaining, if not worth a second watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7:\\n\\n\r\nOverall, as mentioned above, I probably won't ever watch it again, but I'd definitely recommend it to someone looking for something different in the fan-service genre of entertaining absurdity. \\n\\n\r\nRecommendations:\\n\\n\r\n1. Golden Boy. While I hate to always toss out Golden Boy for a recommendation for series like this, it's hard NOT to, as it is likely the greatest ecchi series ever made. I think the reason why I recommend it in this case though is that both the series make ample use of perverted comedy, but there are also moments in which the series both attempt to stab at something greater than mindless entertainment for perverts. While Golden Boy is significantly more so, I believe both shows had a sense about that that I might suggest: \"they've got heart.\"\\n\\n\r\n2. Air Gear. These are both ecchi series that can offer something fun outside of gratuitous fan-service, and they both are absolutely ridiculous.",

            "content": "Overall - 7:\r\nThis anime is a humorous look into a world where lewdness is banned. The main character is bland, a lot of the humor is repetitive, and there are plenty of moments that had me wounding about the specific rules of the world. All that said I had an enjoyable time watching this anime, because some of what it does is quite charming.\r\nStory - 7:\r\nThey tried to explain how the world they want to exist works, they just didn't do a good job. Frequently I would wonder why the PMs would catch one thing, but not another. The story itself is kinda simple, itdoesn't really need to be all that complex, but I just didn't really think it was all that good.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6:\\n\r\nThere's nothing bad about the art. There is nothing too good about it either.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6:\\n\r\nThere are a couple good tracks in the OST, and the OP/ED are good, but for the most part the sound is meh. There were a couple of times the delivery of some of the lines fell flat, but it didn't happen too often.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8:\\n\r\nMost of the characters are good. Ayame is charming and sticks to what she believes in. Anna is ... Anna created some very interesting scenes, and greatly improved the show overall by constantly being a factor to consider. For the most part the cast is enjoyable, there were a couple characters I didn't much care for, but even they were still well written and had something to contribute to the show as a whole. The one character I like the least is probably Tanukichi. His reasons for doing what he does are alright, but the way he handles himself throughout the show is generic and unappealing. He objects to every dirty joke despite being constantly exposed to them and aware that they won't go away.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8:\\n\r\nThere were times this anime really had me laughing. Occasionally I would be confused about how stuff worked. Overall it was just enjoyable to see what the characters would do, or what their plan for a particular situation would be.",

It contains practically not panty shots and actually critiques those who pursue those no matter how dehumanizing they are, which is totally not what you would expect from an anime that proudly proclaims itself as completely dirty and I absolutely loved every minute of it! Seriously! Everyone who thinks of themselves as left-wing and who seeks to be part of the movement towards a better, more inclusive world needs to watch this anime, if they can handle it.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, there are just a couple trigger warnings for anyone who is sensitive to certain things. There is something of a \"rape\" scene, though it's nowhere near as violent or unpleasant as something like Game of Thrones. There are a couple moments which could be interpreted as transphobic, one is sort of okay if you look at it right, the other two are definitely more juvenile and not okay. Finally, the big, final villain will probably make you very, very uncomfortable as he is kind of, for lack of a better world, very \"rapey\", but, if you can handle those, then you're in for an anime that is explicit, filthy, hilarious, and, surprising, full of so much heart and a great message to tell. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I prefer the dub because I can just listen to the jokes and get them right away rather than having to read and absorb them, but I've heard good things about the subbed version, too. Seriously, Shimoneta is now on my list of favourite animes and trust me, it deserves a chance, if you're willing to give it that! Come on! Let's all become dirty jokes! :D",

We live in a generation where people are offended by anything and everything.  We see this censorship as panicky snowflakes scream their outrage and demand everyone submit to their way of thinking.\r\nShimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai parodies this authoritarian mindset by creating a world where they get their way at least on the subject of sex.  It is a fun and exciting comedy full of energy but it isalso condemning high horsed authoritarians that think that if they don't like something than no one should be allowed to enjoy it.",

            "content": "Shimoneta is, indeed, like dirty jokes. It initially have you convulsing in the waves of orgasm-ic humour. As it gets old, you are left with a sensation of post ejaculation emptiness... I will see myself out.\r\n-Majestic entry, disappointing development-\r\nThe first episode is really memorable, we are first greeted by an interesting premise, a host of potentially interesting characters, and most important, a story that could go anywhere.\r\nThe first five episodes that forms the first arc are nothing to scoff at either, the humour is still fresh, and there is some manner of subtle foreshadowing suggesting an interesting character development tucked in each \"terrorism of theweek\".\\n\\n\r\nAll of this culminates into a climax at episode five. Though it first looks like the end of the first arc opens up plenty of opportunities for the characters to grow, they never really did. The host of characters introduced in the beginning have stagnated and becomes predictable. It is also around this time that the jokes turn stale.\\n\\n\r\nTo compensate, more and more characters are introduced to the story, however, there is not enough cohesion to make all the characters important. Eventually, it becomes difficult to be entertained as we care neither about the characters nor the plot.\\n\\n\r\n-A different approach to ecchi-\\n\r\nDespite all its ridiculous ecchi scenarios, there is an internal logic within the universe. Unlike the run of the mill \"panty shot where you looking at baka slap\" situation, Shimoneta executes its fan service within its own twisted, yet justified logic.\\n\\n\r\n-A mixed bag of sounds-\\n\r\nThe quirky OST is subjectively good. It features some acapella and south asian style music, uncommon in anime, much less so in slice of life anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is the true mixed bag. Anna's VA (rest in peace), is excellent when it comes to lewd scenes, but sounds rather flat otherwise. My biggest gripe is Saotome's voice acting. Her voice is uncomfortable to listen to, and is hardly necessary to reinforce her character.\\n\\n\r\n-Conclusion-\\n\r\nThe first five episodes are really worth checking out. If you do not enjoy that at all, don' waste your time trudging through the rest of the series. If expecting Anna to grow more is the reason you keep watching pass ep5, don't, because she fundamentally stays the same.",

            "content": "The recent Reddit drama has brought to light one of the most heated debates concerning the anime community: censorship. What should be considered obscene? What should be keep away from out kids? How should we implement filters to enforce our rules? Shimoneta is a satirical depiction of a Japan that has taken this to the extreme. As the OP narrates before every episode:\n\"A few decades have passed since the use of indecent words and phrases, in both public and private, have become prohibited throughout Japan.    \nThanks to relentless legislation and the introduction of the PM surveillance system, Japan attained its status asthe nation with the most pristine public morals in the world.    \\n\nThis is a story about a group of boys and girls fighting to overthrow this boring world where the concept of dirty jokes does not exist.\"\\n\\n\n***The backdrop might be serious. The anime is not***\\n\\n\nReddit censoring, Japan's censoring, all of that is serious business and Shimoneta does indeed cover this. But the manner in which it is all carried out is anything but. The setting for the anime is a near future Japan, where all citizens are forced to wear [PM collars](https://imgur.com/3cVYyNj) that also act as [wearable computers.](https://imgur.com/PBtoWkp) Due to absolute and complete censorship of NSFW material by the government, nobody in the highschool setting is aware of sex jokes or even the concept of sex. This leads to a bizarre situation where students act more bizarrely towards the idea of sex than normal people did before the ban. Quite the setting for a comedy.\\n\\n\nThis bizarreness is best represented in the character of [Anna.](http://i.imgur.com/WxqQEcL.png) As the head of the student council and the daughter of the politician pushing for stricter censorship laws she should be the purest character in the entire anime. However, as she has no knowledge of how to act on her desires [she turns into a sexually aggressive monster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa9zkPY4IAY) all while still maintaining the purest of intentions.\\n\\n\n***To fix this broken world***\\n\\n\nA common criticism towards this anime is the abundance of 'reverse' rape situations where President Anna sexually assaults the MC. An important point to keep in mind though is that the anime never condones these advances nor does it paint it in a good light.\\n\\n\nThis is where the main characters of this anime are brought in. The story follows [Okuma Tanukichi](https://imgur.com/cWn8HPq) and the anti-censorship terrorist organization on grounds: S.O.X (**S**ex happens most **O**ften on **X**mas), led by the [charismatic 'Blue Snow'](https://imgur.com/h5KP3N2). Their goal is to show off to the world how oppressed everyone in this world is, and to fight for the rights of those who enjoy NSFW material. All this while armed solely with sex jokes and a few porn magazines left over from before the censorship days. Their mission is to protest loudly and to distribute knowledge to those who have been too brainwashed so not to allow monsters like Anna to be created.\\n\\n\n***What are we censoring? A little serious thought.***\\n\\n\nIn the end, the world of Shimoneta will never actually happen. But it is also interesting to look into what it has to say about our world. What are we censoring, and for what purpose? Some things are NSFW and should always be tagged as such, but would the world truly be a better place if nobody had access to them at all times? While thinking about the children, are we inadvertently  going to craft our own Annas who wouldn't know how to act when faced with their own desires?\\n\\n\nBut on the other side of the token, The PM system ***has*** reduced crime and improved neo-Japan's reputation is a pristine and low crime nation. If a country right now was promised similar results by implementing the PM system, would it not make sense for them to take up that offer?\\n\\n\nThis analogy becomes even more interesting as it is applied to websites like Reddit. As the 7th most popular website on the internet with no age limit it has a reputation and userbase to worry about. And unlike with nations, it won't really be restricting users freedoms with any censorship rules as those affected can effortlessly switch to other platforms. At this point a slightly controversial censor to vastly improve image almost sounds like a nobrainer.\\n\\n\n***A vision of hope, and back to the fun*** \\n\\n\nThis unanswerable debate is part of the reason that even by the end of the anime, neither side has a comprehensive victory. The anime does not try to answer the question of which side is correct, but is content at celebrating the Perorists' struggles for our fetishes and lewd animu. And we as an audience don't have to actively join the fight, but can be happy that there are those who will stand up for our hobbies.\\n\\n\nTo close off this [WT!] I'll leave two of this anime's most famous and enjoyable assets: [The hilariously retro and epic Opening theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syoV9y_s00M) and the [insanely catchy Ending theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXoD8ppN3Rs)",

            "content": "Shimoneta greatly depends on the way you look at it. You can see a trashy Light Novel adaptation which does perverted jokes for no reason and has boring characters. But in my opinion then you have not understood the deeper meaning of Shimoneta at all. \r\nThe setting of Shimoneta is a kind of Dystopie, in which dirty jokes and anything sexual got forbidden. A setting which kind of reminds you of at that time newer japanese laws about more censorship were etablished. And here is what Shimoneta kind of tries to do. It warns and shows criticism about the dangers of censorship, by making itin a over the top way dystopie the topic, while showing the trouble arising due to that. Children not knowing anything about sex is greatly exaggerated in many scenes and even with the main character Anna criticized, as she tried to rape the protagonist, as she did not now what she was doing. She the world is not all love and sunshine, but does a great job of criticizing the problems of missing knowledge and censorship. Thought the best part is the irony of being censored in speech and Art all the time while criticizing exactly that. The two female main characters also represent there two different ideas, instead of being characters with more of a interesting personality. While Anna is considered \"pure\" and \"just\", she does act upon her extreme feelings, trying to rape Tanikuchi, as she does not now, that her acts oppose her ideals. Which makes her the counterpart of the SOX Leader Ayame, who does know everything about sex, but when faced with lewd things, often backs down after all, knowing a feeling of shame, coming from her education. The only weaker character is of course the main character, who really does not feel any different from any other 08/15 main character. \\n\r\nYet the character Artwork is great, shows many different ideas, as much as possible in the typical highschool setting. The story is great especially when one likes dirty jokes and a deeper meaning behind all of that. \\n\r\nThe reason I like Shimoneta is, that it, behind its funny and exaggerated facade, it has a deeper meaning and story, especially compared to most other typical Ecchi series",

Enjoy dirty jokes\r\n2. You understand the meaning of \"number 1\" above xD\r\nYeah, because if you're not a pervert and didn't enjoy dirty jokes\r\nThis anime maybe not for you (You can skip to the very last paragraph maybe?)\r\nBut wait, there's a certain wise person said\r\nThere are only 2 people in this world\r\nOpen pervert & Closet pervert (See Log Horizon for futher info)\r\nSo, probably if you reading this... Yeah you're one of those two xD\r\nYou just never knowwhat will come to your face until you watch it\\n\r\nYep that's the definition of this anime\\n\r\nThe story is about \"terrorist\" that want to make sure \"justice\" is everywhere\\n\r\nLooks like a superhero-cliche story\\n\r\nSo why \"terrorist\"?\\n\r\nBecause in this anime the society is too proper and way to clueless to something that lewd\\n\\n\r\nAt first maybe you're interested in this anime because you're hoping that the jokes will be like Seitokai Yakuindomo?\\n\r\nYou're coming in a right place\\n\r\nThis anime is like Seitokai Yakuindomo\\n\r\nMainly the jokes are dirty jokes\\n\r\nBut this one is lewder and have more \"ecchi\" scene than Seitokai Yakuindomo\\n\r\nAh \\n\r\nFYI, this anime is kinda influenced by Hentai Kamen\\n\r\nBecause of the costume and the superhero thing\\n\\n\r\nThe art, you can say it's really pretty\\n\r\nI mean J.C. Staff did the job done\\n\r\nThey almost done the good job everytime\\n\r\nYeah everytime until Denpa Kyoushi\\n\\n\r\nOP & ED are catchy\\n\r\nThe voice acting for this one\\n\r\nYou just can't describe it with words\\n\r\nThey really did a great job\\n\r\nEspecially Ayame's seiyuu , you need to practice and more than bravery to do all of that\\n\r\n*clap hands\\n\r\nShe's a pretty new seiyuu too, but she really did a great job (Just look at her other characters, so different)\\n\r\nAh also I won't forget Anna's seiyuu\\n\r\nHer voice... I can't never go back\\n\r\nMainly her seiyuu's characters are innocent one\\n\r\nBut this...\\n\r\nProbably you'll shock to hear what you'll hear in this anime\\n\\n\r\nThe characters\\n\r\nI'm not going to spoil it so much\\n\r\nThey almost have all of them\\n\r\nFor the example\\n\r\nThe straight-man (which is the MC), the open-pervert, the closet-pervert, the unsuspected one, the time-bomb, the very manly one, the supporting (perverts) characters\\n\r\nThe way they interact with each other, episode by episode, bit by bit .. I mean like the character development kinda weird (in a good way) & amusing too everytime you watch\\n\r\nIt's cliche but at same time it funny & really enjoyable\\n\r\nYou'll be either facepalming or laughing, because they're so ridiculously dirty xD\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is full of dirty jokes, so you know what to expect right?\\n\r\nProbably you'll be cringe for the entire time, so make sure uhh.. you're ready to face dirty jokes!\\n\r\nAlso don't watch it with someone else or in open space\\n\r\nThat'll be so dangerous (&awkward), so good kid don't do that xD\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nIf you enjoy something like Seitokai Yakuindomo\\n\r\nThat have a big amount of dirty & s*x jokes\\n\r\nYou should try this anime\\n\r\nIt's rare to see a daring story like this one\\n\\n\r\nHope this review helps!! :)\\n\r\nHave a good day and support SOX by signing this review!",

            "content": "Perverts of the world. Please get together in one single anime. That is, this one, of course. You won't be disappointed.\r\nHere it is, a review of this singular but enjoyable (at least for me) anime. It will be quick and painless.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nAlthough this story isn't a quite melodramatic or epic one, it had its point... somehow. It's just some teens trying to restore perversion taken from their wotld (as anyone would do). There're a lot of dirty jokes (which make the story have lots of sense) and some dirty scenes too (some of them don't leave too much to the imagination). But damn, I likedthat sh**.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nIt's so simple it really fits. There're not so many special effects or amazing animation effects, but I think this is not an anime that should have them. The right animation for a comedy (singular) anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nWell I loved the ending. Sound effects in the series are played when needed (wink), but there's not a memorable soundtrack for it, nor it needs it, I think.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\r\nI know, I know, this is a comedy (again, singular) anime, and characters aren't usually deeply developed in those kinds of series. And this one wasn't the exception.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI laughed so loud in every episode I think I should worry about it. I really enjoyed this series, for a strange reason.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nPervert/curious/comedy lover one? Do watch it. This is a kind of anime you'll never forget. If you like these kind of things you know. So you better have some sense of humor (and some dirty one if possible) if you want to enjoy it too.",

            "content": "\"The day with the most S*X in it is X-mas\"\r\nLooks like JC staff decided to take the dirty way, by adapting Shimnometa, where sexual jokes is banned in Japan.  Well, we talk dirty jokes right? \r\nI wouldn't say it's to indecent or inappropriate to watch, because I came here to watch the plot. Shimnometa focuses on Ayame trying to bring back dirty jokes in order for the society not to be boring, while Okuma clearly doesn't like indecent things but still wanted to help, which is great. I see the progression, I see the storyline and all focuses on bringing back dirty jokes butnot radically af like the white peak, who has a fetish on pantsu. Since it has storyline, it's great they made it not too complex and I, myself easily understand what they are achieving for. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs likewise aren't that bad, quite appealing. The animations are the JC staff quality which they had produced some of the best anime such as Toradora and Sakurasou. No weird animations, everything is smooth. It's great that it is not too saturated but some scene especially at sunset is a little bit dark to see. But still, great quality of work.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP was enjoyable and is stuck in my head right now while the ED was catchy to listen. The seiyuus are well-picked, I love how Ayame's voice acting especially the laughing part and Anna's voice acting when she is turned on by Okuma. Okuma on the other hand sound like Hiro Shimono but actually the seiyuu is from Shirobako's VA. Still he did a good job.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoy all the characters in this series, especially Ayame, I love how she decided to go against the decency system for the sake of having dirty jokes back but rather not be too radical, even though she can have dirty minded things, she does show her kindness side like giving praise to Okuma but still praising in a dirty way. For Anna, well I do like her because when she got turned on, she posses superhuman power which well, can bring down a person in a mere second and tend to run super fast to get Okuma. Though she is calm and very strict on lewdness but she get turned on when she hit the table or smell Okuma's \"things\"\\n\\n\r\nWith 12 episodes finished airing, I do enjoy watching it even though it is mostly on sexual jokes, well I don't mind since I watch seitokai yakuindomo, since both share the same theme which is dirty jokes. I don't mind if it get a season two, cause I would love to see more Okuma sufferings from Anna's turned on mode xD.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nIt's funny how a show that is pretty much about lewd things can be very entertaining and really funny especially considering the whole show is just one big sexual innuendo.\r\nIn a world where Japan has cleansed it's country of everything obscene and impure an organisation called SOX lead by Ayame Kajou AKA Blue Snow has recruited a student named Tanukichi Okuma and together their on a crusade to make Japan see the nude aspects of the human body once more.\r\nNow even though this about people trying to make Porn legal again it is somewhat interesting how restricting anything porn or hentai related canactually have a big impact on people's education about sexual interaction and the fact that Ayame and her SOX members are trying to get this sort of thing out there so that people know more about it so it isn't just about people trying to make porn legal again so they can enjoy they are also trying to make sure that the people forget everything about sexual intercourse otherwise people will have no idea what a P*nis or a Vag*na is and how to use them properly.\\n\r\nIt was really fun seeing the actions that SOX took to make sure that the students got what they needed and what they learned themselves which did lead to some really funny experiments like creating lube and vibrators, however despite SOX's efforts it got really interesting when other groups got involved that were doing the wrong thing like stealing peoples underwear and putting it on themselves which shows that not everyone is trying to do the right thing and just want to pleasure themselves.\\n\r\nThere is also a lot of funny interactions with the characters as well because since most of them don't know about sexual interactions themselves it does lead to some really funnily awkward moments especially between Okuma and Anna.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters certainly hold their own in this show although most are likeable there are a few that just don't hit the right buttons.\\n\r\nAyame is the female MC and is the leader of SOX as she goes by her secret identity known as Blue Snow which is literally just her nude under a white blanket with her underwear as a mask, she is very smart and a good strategist, but she is very free with her vulgar vocabulary which is just hilarious however she is incredibly determined to make sure that the world doesn't forget and enjoy the pleasure of sexual freedom.\\n\r\nOkuma is the male MC and is completely the opposite of Ayame since he hates anything obscure and impure mainly because his father used to like Ayame and his crush Anna in his eyes is a prime example of a pure girl, however thanks to his father he is a very important member of SOX since he has more knowledge of sexual interaction compared to the others, but he doesn't really like being put into this position and was forced to join SOX because Ayame forced him, but made him a promise to get him closer to Anna.\\n\r\nAnna Nishikinomiya is the student council president and enforces the strict laws at  Tokioka Academy, she is a very soft-spoken and innocent person however when Okuma accidentally kissed her it unlocked her sexual side and she became a sexually crazy Yandere and wanted to forcefully make love to Okuma multiple times which causes her to believe that enforcing the laws even more will make him love her, she can also be incredibly strong even to the point where it seems like a superpower.\\n\r\nOtome Saotome is the propaganda artist for SOX although initially she was the Academy's best artist, but she had an incredible desire to draw lewd drawings and thanks to SOX she could do that, she can go crazy at something sexually that's new to her like experiencing what sexual intercourse is like (not doing it just observing it).\\n\r\nKosuri Onigashira is the last member of SOX to join and is a big fan of what SOX is doing, she was mainly recruited because her hairstyle resembled the tip of a Pe*is. Her methods though aren't exactly trustworthy though because she is very manipulative and uses her charm with boys and everyone around so she can acquire what she wants making her a very domineering person when she has them in the palm of her hands.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle wasn't too different from many other anime's, but it certainly focused on making itself look as lewd as possible like the design of Ayame's Blue Snow outfit or when the main villain White Peak wearing panties all over himself which just looked disgusting and weird really, the drawings that Otome makes as well looked very graphic too them again she just wants to draw something Lewd, it's funny when it tries to censor something too like when flies are having sex and it just shows a cartoony drawing.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy was pretty funny as watching the SOX members trying to understand some sexual aspects of the human body was a sight to watch and they were never on the same line especially Okuma and Ayame who are the complete opposite of each other so they never really agreed with each other unless it was something serious, there was also some moments that went pretty far though like showing Gouriki in women's underwear which burned my eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice was great since the sexual innuendos were always put in at the right moments and Ayame's vulgar language was just the icing on the cake, but Anna was the true aspect of fanservice in this show since there were multiple times where she was butt naked and and other moments that got her extremely aroused like a vibrator getting stuck in her cleavage and constantly vibrating them or whenever she's desperately trying to taste some of Okuma's Love Nectar if you know what I mean, so yeah the fan service was pretty much on another scale compared to some other anime's.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a really funny, entertaining and in some ways educational anime, I would like a second season since the ending does give that kind of feeling that there is more to tell and hopefully maybe in the future we'll get that second season.",

            "content": "Shimoneta: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesn't Exist\r\nWow. Taken totally off-guard by this anime. I was laughing my cheeks off during the initial episodes of this show. In fact, the entire anime continues on at the same drastically juicy pace that it began with throughout the entire series. Somehow, the human mind can interpret dirty metaphors about men and women using objects other than bananas and cream pies. Crazy, right?\r\nIf you have no idea what I am talking about, then you are in for one wild, slippery, wet, hot sweaty, luscious time! There has never been an anime in the historyof Jeffrey Penner that has been this ecchi, and I've seen some stuff man!\\n\\n\r\nKeep your eyes peeled, stay calm, and don't let your shorts grow larger around the waist with another man in the room. Good luck.\\n\\n\r\nRatings:\\n\r\nStory - 7 - The story is there, but it's not. It's like a slice of life trying hard to  implore a great purpose. It's strange and somehow pans out in the end. It's not choppy and confusing, no. It's just a weak story line, but that's not why we watch these kinds of anime, do we.\\n\r\nGraphics - 8 - Very provocative and grossly awesome in eccentric ways.\\n\r\nSoundtrack - 8 - Definitely fits the mood at points. Kind of like a detective story sound track at points.\\n\r\nCharacter personas - 7 - The main character can be funny at times, but doesn't carry a strong personality. He is mostly goaded into doing things that the lady wants to do, and sucks at defending himself. The female characters all have kinky personalities, and the student council president's personality was the main reason for myself watching this anime, for fact.\\n\r\nCharacter voice-over (English) - 8 - The main female characters had great voice acting, and the male did a great job, as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7 - It's like one of those anime that you watch because you hear it's funny, and then it turns out to be grossly fascinating.\\n\r\nRecommended - Prepare yourself for something interesting. I recommend this because it's different and interesting, but not because of any epic quality.",

            "content": "I am one of those anime watchers that purposefully seek out anime with a more eechi background. If it's Harem or Eechi, sign me up.  Enter \"Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai\" where the entire series is predicated on eechi jokes as a world building tool and for a long time this has been a series that has flown on my radar since it's release over a year ago. (It's August 2016 at time of writing)\r\nI finally broke down and watched it, after putting it off for god know what reason, and I can honestly say I enjoyed it, butI feel the need to be slightly critical. See from this series I was hoping to get something it never went the full way to provide... and no it's not raunchy eechi scenes, it had that in spades.\\n\\n\r\n\"Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai\" comes so tantalizingly close to being more than a series about eechi. As a world setting it has ample opportunities to be about several political issues such as Government Monitoring, Censorship, Police States, even Sexual Education in schools. Heck even if they never take those topics there's also peaceful revolution versus terrorism in the modern world and it. pardon the pun, skirts the edge. \\n\\n\r\nNow I'm sure it has a lot to do with the market this anime was set up to sell to. Let's face it, us eechi watching anime otaku, neets and hikikomoris are not the type of people who are going to start a revolution. Far from it. However I cant help but be mad at the missed opportunity. \\n\\n\r\nOtherwise, it's overall a good series, I guess there's nothing really else to talk about, oh wait I almost forgot, A MAIN CHARACTER GETS RAPED. I mean look, I'm not bringing this up because of the whole \"rape is bad m-kay\" I feel I shouldn't have to say this, but I mean it is GRAPHIC. They don't hold ANYTHING back (okay not true they do) but this is messed up right? Is this just me? and we're supposed to laugh, like this is all okay right? \\n\\n\r\nStill, it's a good series. You should be watching it. Ota-kun out.",

Now it does make some points about how censorship laws are awful, how creativity should prevail as well as some major points about how everyone should be free to be themselves, and how low brow entertainment has inherent value, all points that are incredibly important and especially relevant to modern times. However, considering the package that all of this is wrapped up in, it's very much preaching to the choir, as anyone who doesn't already agree tothese points would not be able to watch such a show, though everyone does love to have their viewpoints reinforced so I suppose there's value there. The show is incredibly vulgar, in that there actually isn't all that much nudity or explicit content, but everything is constantly dripping in juvenile perversion. And it is incredibly hilarious at being so. I don't think any of the characters nor the plot had any particular depth to them beyond having some complexity for the sake of humor. However, the set up of characters and the plot itself allows for a steady stream of hilarious situations while still giving the viewer some level of interest in what happens next. It does incredibly well regarding this in that it is hilarious from beginning to end, with even serious moments being full of innuendo and such. It's all completely ridiculous but all still completely amazing.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation were solid. Anna's facial expressions were especially amazing. The OP/ED weren't particularly great on their own but fit the show perfectly. The soundtrack wasn't particularly memorable.",

Maybe it was because I myself have ill intentions, or maybe I have an appreciation for what I consider to be an innovative plot.

I'm down with this anime. This is my kind of heroine. I am actually enjoying this quite well, the jokes are dirty and the humor gives a good chuckle every 3 or so seconds in specific dialogues. The characters so far bounce off each other quite decently, it's still too early to say completely. I digress, yamate...\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the sound is ok, has some points where you listen and think if it belongs as one of the tones preset in your phone, and other times you think it's a nice rendition, so meh. I look forward to continuing this series in my weekly quest to build my own harem. My opinions are not to really state a true review on the anime, I'm no pro, I'm just theworstshow.

On the one hand, it brings up a lot of good points about moral extremism on both sides of the spectrum in regards to human sexuality. On the other, it's basically a means to deliver nonstop dirty jokes that I really didn't want to laugh at, yet somehow couldn't resist.\r\nThe animation's not too bad, though that just ends up making some scenes all the more uncomfortable, which I suppose may have been part of the point. \r\nThe characters aren't too bad, but theytend to get somewhat irritating after a few episodes. For the most part, they don't really change. Any development really only occurs within the first few episodes, and from that point the characters think and act pretty much the same way for the rest of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe humor was indeed rather entertaining for the first few episodes, but quickly got old. I suppose if you don't mind a story that ultimately relies on sexual humor throughout the entirety of the story, then you probably won't have a problem with Shimoneta.

            "content": "I'm not going to write a review explaining the story or anything, but rather just to address this show's critics.\r\nI've seen people's reviews of this series complaining about the lack of story, character depth, etc. My question is why? What did you come into this series expecting? Deep character progression? A riveting story filled with plot twists and heart pounding moments? Deep romance? What are you, insane?\r\nSince when did every anime need to try to be Shakespeare or the next Cowboy Bebop? Shimoneta is a series with a singular purpose: set up a ridiculous, silly world with a silly cast and make silly jokes. Asof season 1, I haven't seen any real attempts for this series to try to be deep and thought provoking, which is good. That's not the intended purpose. I watched Highschool DxD before, and I always thought that series was hindered by trying to have so many serious moments with boobs everywhere. Shimoneta attempts none of that and I'm happier for it. The problem with trying to add character development and more serious plot development in a comedy series is running the risk of making contradictory characters. \\n\\n\r\nI love Gintama to death, but I'm willing to admit that the cast of the series is flat out bipolar for the sake of jokes. There are episodes and arcs focused on the friendship between Gintoki, Kagura and Shinpachi, but then you'll also get episodes and arcs where they treat each other like crap and disregard all the friendship stuff from before. You also have moments with characters like Kondo Isao where one minute they're a creepy stalker pervert, but then later on we're expected to watch episodes with them where they're played straight and heroic. I love the series, but come on. This stuff is pretty silly.\\n\\n\r\nComedy genre characters exist to make telling jokes as easy as possible, not to develop into a better person or have life changing experiences. This often means they will be one note because anything else isn't very funny. Would you want Cartman or Archer to become better people in their shows? \\n\\n\r\nI also want to add in that this series is being adapted from an ongoing light novel. Was there a character you think got no background, like Tsukimigusa? The series ended with the plot unresolved? That makes sense because it's not done. Again, bringing up Highschool DxD, season 1 left plenty of characters unexplained, like Koneko and Kiba, but if you waited for season 2, it actually covered that. More than likely Shimoneta is the same case. Judging the plot of this series based on an incomplete season 1 is like judging Fate/Zero after only watching season 1. You're trying to draw a conclusion on a story that isn't even done. If the series never gets completed, you can hold that one against it, but Shimoneta is too new to know if it'll continue or not. And for those not familiar with light novels, the plots generally don't move at the speed of light. \\n\\n\r\nBut if you want the TL:DR version of this:\\n\\n\r\nShimoneta is meant for laughs. You don't watch South Park for the plot, and this show should be treated the same.",

I even found myself laughing all throughout the 12 episodes. Each character is likable with specific quarks that set them apart from your average series, the only thing I found lacking was the main character was kinda your average harem template with more on the inside thanout. Although it's not a sound based show it had well timed and not god awful tracks and was generally pleasing to listen to. Overall I had a wonderful time watching this and would love more like it.",

The story is about a world where the concept of sexual jokes doesnt exist/are banned and a terrorist group called \"S.O.X\" is trying to bring out the perverted minds in people. I dont know how to describe the art style in shimoneta other than: modern/recent, which I am also a big fan of. The opening song is amazing, i even downloaded it because it is just so amazing, i skip most anime openings because they take too long and i want to get to the anime itself, but idont with shimoneta, mainly because of the music and funny animations. As for the characters, i really liked all the secretly perverted characters, and the part where all the students get horny after watching flies having sexual intercourse, because it shows that everyone is actually perverted and is actually human. I especially like Anna after episode 3 because that also shows that even the most well mannered are perverts, and ofcourse Ayame is on point with her jokes and euphemisms. The scientist Hyouka is also one of the funniest characters i've seen in an anime, with how dead serious she sounds and how she always makes Tanukichi uncomfortable with her questions about \"body melting\" (a.k.a. making a baby). You'll definitely like this anime if you like sexual/perverted jokes, or like yandere girls which are constantly horny for a guy. This is one of my favorite animes and i find this overall to be a masterpiece (I am re-watching it at the moment).",

The only two issues that I have with this anime is that I don't like White Peak and that the anime endwhen you want more; yes, the ending is perfect, but I still wanted more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I highly highly recommend this for those who like sexual comedy and very well developed characters ^^",

Nevermind the fact that it's hilarious; or that it\u2019s even made more hilarious because of the censorship/editing. The only thing I love about this anime is I 100% support S0X. I don\u2019t wish to live in a world devoid of dirty jokes, I abhor the thought of the most prudish of prudes setting policy on our behalf. But more than that, it showcases what a lack of comprehensive sex education can do to people. That\u2019s also what makes it funny. The ideal that a simpletalking to or one page from a book could fix this and yet they live in a world where the solution to their problem has been made illegal. I love how it showcases what kind of people embrace censorship to push their own agenda. It\u2019s never once explained why this world came into being (it is a comedy after all), it just happened and the majority went along with it. So naturally there\u2019d be dissention. The series also show how deviants will use any cause or agenda to advance their aberrant ideals. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important. It\u2019s a raunchy comedy anime, that has a message that needs to be heard. \\n\r\nUsually this is the part where I mention the things that some individuals may not like in the series to keep it objective; but not in this case. See if you see things that offend you in this series, that\u2019s the point. To live in a world devoid of that which makes you uncomfortable may be doing society a disservice. Shimoneta proves it. Rather than hide our nature it\u2019s best to whip it out and thrust it forth so that it splatters all over their face and they lick it up. Watch and love, watch it and hate it, watch it and apathetically move on to the next series in your queue; but please just watch it!\\n",

This show did not have a very good conclusion in fact I would go as far as saying it didn't have any conclusion which could be a little bit annoying butdoesn't matter too much since it is mainly just a goofy comedy.

            "content": "There have been studies done in the past that have shown that countries that have banned or put restrictions on pornography or other sexually illicit materials tend to encounter more sexually driven crimes. People can place this on the idea that without entertainment to satiate those crimes, we tend to let curiosity take the wheel.\r\nBut, In a World Where No Dirty Jokes exist, I can't imagine anything worse than being in a dystopia where the cringe disappears into nothing more than girls like Ana ravaging because in their minds lust and love blur into each other. \r\nAh, who am I kidding. This show is thefarthest thing from serious, and shouldn't be looked at more than a gag to quell the minds of various people who want to watch visual junk. The colors aren't great. The story is cliche and raunchy, to say the least. The sound is far from impeccable, but fits in well. The only thing worth noting is that... It works. Shimoneta succeeds because it knows what it wants to be: heartfelt fun. The constant antics of trying to find porno mags and distribute them. Various terrorist groups wearing, most of the time, moist panties on their faces. And, ridiculous lines mainly about sucking ****. It's a show that doesn't try to create for itself a greater meaning. Anyone that tries to argue for that is really missing the point of this show. It's whole theme is that people who look for purity or even take the world too serious aren't just hurting themselves, they're hurting each other. Take some time and tell a dirty joke or even cringe a little. That's what makes life fun or, at least, remove itself from constant monotony.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is hardly for everyone, and there are other shows that have done this cringe-fest comedy-barrage style better: Daily Life of High School Boys / The Devil is a Part-Timer / Cromartie High School. However, none of those I believe achieved what I think Shimoneta has, which is to stick close to what they believe in. Keep telling dirty jokes. And, if you ever get bored please give this a watch. Turn off your brain and have fun.",

            "content": "Comedy is an incredibly subjective matter. What one person considers funny may not be what another person considers funny. This means when you base the entire premise on one very specific brand of humor you appeal to a certain group of people and risk alienating everyone else. Shimoneta does this very thing with its preferred joke of choice being dirty jokes. It\u2019s even in the darn title. If that concept does not strike you as something you would enjoy I doubt this show would change many opinions but for those that would enjoy this type of humor or are on the fence, there might besomething here for you.\\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, this show is ridiculous. There is no sugar-coating, nothing subtle, only in your face obscenity. Things start off innocently enough with Okuma, our main character, who is, for the most part, a law abiding citizen in a society where anything that could be remotely considered sexual is blacklisted and destroyed on site. Then everything changed when the Blue Snow appeared. Kajo (a.k.a. Blue Snow) ropes Okuma into her group, S.O.X., and together they spread the word of everything lewd by doing everything from streaming video of flies in the act of mating (while providing voice work) to organizing full on raids in order to acquire pornographic magazines.\\n\\n\r\nI said before that Shimoneta has zero subtlety in its jokes and because of this there is an initial shock value that makes one question \u201cWhat did I just watch?\u201d and this level of shock and hilarity remains largely consistent for the first couple of episodes. That is at least until Anna\u2019s true form is unleashed. Anna is the student council president of the school where both Okuma and Kajo attend and has, from birth, had these laws of anti-lewd behavior drilled into her mind. What happens when such a paragon of innocence is exposed to her first interactions of sexuality. According to Shimoneta they go absolutely crazy. Comparing Anna to an animal in heat is an understatement as literally nothing would separate her from her lover. \\n\\n\r\nIf I were to point out only one reason as to why one should watch this show it would be because of Anna. Whenever she is placed into a scene she completely owns it. Everyone else\u2019s crazy antics are still humorous but they are dwarfed by what Anna accomplishes. This in itself is somewhat of a double-edged sword however. Anna is such an entertaining character that when there are full episodes where she is seen maybe once are noticeably lacking something. To me, I just wanted to see more Anna and I would be disappointed whenever she did not play a major role. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, because Anna ups the lewdness game with her presence some of the earlier jokes seemed less funny. One recurring joke I got tired of really quickly, for example, is Kajo\u2019s language. In this world where even your words are censored Kajo has a device that allows her to speak freely whatever comes to her mind within a certain time frame. What do you think she uses this privilege for? She uses it work sexual puns into pretty much every sentence she can. At first I could say it had a certain charm. It is not something you see in every anime afterall. Midway through I could not help but think it was forced and pun humor could only go so far. This goes for the show as a whole as well. As I said before, the jokes were largely effective early on because of how shocking they were but as time goes on you become accustomed to the antics and very easily see where the punchlines are coming from. The delivery is still funny though the overall impact is much less impressive.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, whether you enjoy this show or not boils down to whether you find this show funny. To me, there are moments of brilliance but could feel myself getting tired of these jokes later in the season. There are only so many times I can allow myself to laugh at a dick joke before I just have to cringe at the fact that you are still telling dick jokes. Give Anna more screen time or riot I say.",

            "content": "Shimoneta is an Anime that deals with the concept of Censorship and Perversion in a very amusing way. This is an Anime that is the type you should never see with your family for all the lewdness it has. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story takes place in a slightly futuristic Japan where 10 years prior to the events of the show, all things sexual are banned from the public (Pornography, Hentai, Ecchi Visual Novels, Sexual Education, you get the idea). The story follows Okuma, a teen starting high school who is trying to clean his name due to his family's past (That is explained in the Anime).Despite wanting a new start to win the heart of his childhood crush Anna, he gets involved with Ayame, who dresses as Snow Peak and acts as a terrorist distributing lewd materials. The anime basically is both of them trying to spread sexual material all throughout the city in an attempt to speak out against censorship and for people to learn about and enjoy sex and other sexual activities. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art is nice and clean, the characters look normal for a modern anime. There's also little chibis of the characters that are shown when something perverse is shown and it acts as a censor bar. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are two of the most catchiest songs I have heard in Anime before, with the OP singing about Morning Wood, Offering a Woman to have sex, and fighting anyone in the name of Sexual freedom. The ED is basically a song about setting yourself free and loving your own sexual nature. Both are really good to listen and it really sets the tone of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nFor an anime about perversion and freedom, there's plenty of interesting characters that make the anime enjoyable. Okuma is the Main Male Character who basically serves as Ayame's sidekick in spreading sexual material, Ayame is a calm and educated young woman who becomes a pervert who cannot stop thinking about sexual acts when she's away from others, Anna is the school president trying to prevent lewd materials from being spread while falling head over heels (literally) for Okuma, Otome is an artist who has the talent of drawing hentai and ecchi with her mouth, and many more that make this anime worth to watch. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10 \\n\r\nThis anime honestly made me laugh at their jokes or blush at their dirty comments in every episode and I have to say it was good for a 12 episode series. The last episode was also good compared to the other 11 episodes but it felt more like an OVA than an episode, but who cares, it was still good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nIf you're a person who likes comedy, dirty jokes or ecchi, this anime is for you. It's a good anime that takes a look into what would happen if Japan censored all things considered sexual (which is something Japan similarly does), and it really could make you laugh and smile. I highly recommend this if you're looking for something fun to watch, but don't watch it with family. Seriously, you're bound to get judged and questioned from watching this.",

            "content": "Ok, let's not kid ourselves here: this anime is so strongly bordering on a hentai that it probably should be included on hentai sites. On MAL it is listed as R+ for \"mild nudity\" and while it's true that you only \"see\" some boobs throughout the show, they use everything and anything as innuendo for full on sex.\r\nNow that that's out of the way, lets continue. (Mild spoilers ahead)\r\nStory: \r\nThis show is brazen, crass, and eyebrow raising, but it's overall message is one I actually agree with; you cannot legislate morality. And, in fact, if you try to force people to be \"moral\" you reallyonly do more harm than good. This is true of any country and culture. Sex is a healthy part of society, and a healthy part of relationships. If you cannot even speak of such things, you are going to create ignorant citizens that eventually do those \"things\" anyway without full knowledge of the consequences of such actions.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, this show is a comedy, so although this is a very serious issue, it is never really explored all that thoroughly. Instead the show focuses on \"dirty jokes.\" In fact, that is what they should have named the show, because honestly that is the main gist of every episode (I know dirty jokes is in the title, I mean it should be called only that). And a lot of the jokes were funny, but some definitely fell flat. The main \"thrust\" of the show was definitely Okuma, who made even the most inappropriate moments feel funny as the character who is the most normal (I use that term loosely). The story never really goes anywhere, it just sort of circles around the main point and throws in a ton of dirty jokes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the shining stars of the show, each of them unique and the voice actors did them justice. My favorites were Okuma and our leading lady Ayame. It was somewhat refreshing to have the female characters be the most lewd, as it's usually the other way around, although sometimes their actions bordered on \"too far\" (if you watch you will know WHO I mean here). \\n\\n\r\nThe Art was nice, nothing extraordinary, but still pleasing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nSound was nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I did enjoy this show, but I probably wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends. It was very funny at times, but the overall feeling of \"hentai\" sometimes made it uncomfortable.",
