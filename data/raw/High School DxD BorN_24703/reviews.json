            "content": "I\u2019m sure by now, High School DxD is a franchise that needs little introduction. There\u2019s little reason that anyone should begin watching the third season without watching the previous series. That\u2019s like reading a book backwards from the last chapter. The thing about the High School DxD franchise is that we have a perverted main character named Issei. Then, there\u2019s a whole horde of harem characters ranging from lovely ouju-samas, a pure innocent blonde, a loli cat with the strength of Hercules, and even an Angel. The math is pretty simple to do. Issei wants to add all of them to his harem formula. However,unlike most harem series that ventures down a road of non-sense, High School DxD actually has a plot. As shocking as it may be, this harem show does actually have plot as the previous seasons proved itself to be actually effective. But unfortunately for High School DxD Born, effective has become a word of the past.\\n\\n\r\nDirected by Tetsuya Yanagisawa, the third season wastes little time to get straight to the point. In fact, the title itself suggest the tone with the word \u2018Born\u2019. For those who can guess it, it\u2019s basically an indirect reference at the way boobs sounds like when they bounce around. I guess by anime logic that means we\u2019ll see a lot of that both to satisfy fans\u2019 needs and plot purposes. With all the buildup and events that leads from one point to another, the third season tries to seize the moment to capitalize on the story. The key word here is \u201ctry\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nStarting from the first few episodes, there\u2019s already a lot going on. Discreetly, we can see that there\u2019s something going on with Koneko that\u2019s bothering her. Similarly enough, the show also reveals more events relating to Chaos Brigade as well as new antagonists. For Koneko, we also see a new girl that wants to take her back by any means until Issei and his group intervenes. Then, there\u2019s other ominous foreshadowing with characters such as Akeno. To say the least, the show can actually be thrilling when it develops these little bits and bits of scenarios like pieces to a puzzle. And any fan of High School DxD can expect, fan service returns as well with boobs, ass, and seductiveness. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the series has a promising start, it wavers down as the story progresses. I have read the light novels and the adaptations is not something that should be impressed by. Not only does the anime omits some appealing elements, it also fails to capture the point of the show especially in the second half. For what\u2019s worth, the series went backwards on itself when it comes to story focus. While the first half of the series adds excitement with the conflicts in the supernatural world, it loses steam almost entirely later on. I say this because the show\u2019s story turns messy with too many events happening and rapid resolutions. The plus side is that characterization retains a somewhat decent degree. But when it comes to storytelling, the third season pummels down the drain. For fans eager for some comedy though, you\u2019ll probably get a good dose out of it from one of Issei\u2019s new bizarre abilities that really emphasizes the \u2018Born\u2019 part of the title.\\n\\n\r\nThe main success of the third season is probably the characters. We have a very diverse and colorful range of characters. Ranging from the return of Issei and the Occult Research Club members to newly introduced characters such as Rossweisse, Odin, Kuroka, and Loki, the show captures the interest of its viewers when we want to see how their roles in the story. As some may guess though, Issei is still the main interest of the show as almost every episode still gives him a prominent role. This includes but not limited to saving from Koneko from her own self despair, giving Akeno the support she needs, or fighting against those he perceives as evil. As stereotypical as he can be, Issei does attract a good degree of honor as even characters such as Vali sees his purpose. However, the characterization doesn\u2019t grow beyond than that as there\u2019s too much happening for this one cour adaptation. Characters such as Ravel returns but hardly gains any spotlight. Rossweisse also makes little impact because of her sensitive personality (notice how she always thinks about how she may never get a boyfriend?). It\u2019s things like this that doesn\u2019t make first impression about a character. Although for perverted characters like Issei, her Valkyrie outfit is another story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s really holding the series back though ultimately comes down to execution. In terms of buildups, the show knows what it\u2019s doing. The characters introduced all show a degree of their personality that let anime only viewers anticipate what they may do next. However, the execution is cheesy. Remember the events of the first season about Asia nearly getting killed? Or the time when there\u2019s fear that Issei\u2019s feelings may never reach Rias? Yeah, we\u2019ve seen that before and the third season wastes time again to exploit these themes. Also for whatever reason, the third season ultimately takes a route that is very clich\u00e9 to the core. As gimmicky as High School DxD Born already is, this season really just doesn\u2019t seem to keep up the momentum it has built. This isn\u2019t just based on adaptation content but also the way the final few episodes are structured. It\u2019s the lack of fun that results from this season\u2019s experimentations that ultimately doesn\u2019t live up to the hype. On the plus side though, there is still uncensored fan service for the fans. The emotional angles can be touching on occasions as High School DxD still retains a level of interest with its other characters. In retrospect though, this season is a very hit or miss for fans. For me, it\u2019s much more of the miss.\\n\\n\r\nAs for technical aspects, there\u2019s not much improvement for artwork. TNK Entertainment still handles the visual quality although there are hardly any changes to the environment of the show. The action is fun to watch on most terms with fine degrees of clever coordination. Unlike previous seasons, High School DxD born features much more of the supernatural world that is decorated to a fine degree to spark the fantasy atmosphere. The dragons, devil, demons, and all sorts of species you wouldn\u2019t find anywhere is convincingly appealing. Then, there\u2019s also the designs of the new characters such as Rosseweisse with her business-like and attractive Valkyrie battle outfit. Kuroka\u2019s catlike dress is also alluring with its suggestive features while we also get modified and enhanced versions of Issei\u2019s Boosted Gear. And at the center of it all, it\u2019s the fan service. Surprisingly, it\u2019s tamer than the previous season although it still seizes opportunities to show skin when it has the chance. Bedroom scenes, dress break, and clever camera angles are its trademarks. Any fan of the franchise shouldn\u2019t be surprised by now as fan service has always been this series\u2019 flagship. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is moderate and there\u2019s nothing really to say much about it. In fact, the ED theme song that fans hope to see an improvement on really doesn\u2019t live up to its expectations. I guess it\u2019s perhaps the first season set the bar too high? Then again, soundtrack is one of the lesser noticeable features of the show. By OST context, the series delivers on most parts with its action features. When it comes to the emotional scenes, it stays honest and has the vulnerability that is convincing. However, that\u2019s pretty much the only impression about it. Character voice mannerisms aren\u2019t really impressive for our new characters. It\u2019s gimmicky to the core with Kuroka\u2019s \u2018nya\u2019, Odin\u2019 ego, or Rossewisse\u2019s nervousness. There\u2019s even less of the suggestive moans and ahhs fans may be eager to hear out of the headphones.\\n\\n\r\nHigh School DxD Born tries far too hard to make it look cool. Fans wants to see a fun, thrilling, and story that matches the momentum it has built. But what do we get instead? A clump of mess that digs itself deeper with inconsistency. Rushing and omitting parts is one thing but following down another road is another. As a 1 cour adaptation, it\u2019s hard to salvage from its mistakes. From my perspective, the show tries to be far too serious as it should be. High School DxD has always been a show that mixes together plot, characters, and most importantly adding fun excitement. It\u2019s almost if it\u2019s self-aware and a main point of the third season never focuses on that point. That being said, you may still get some satisfaction out of the comedy (mostly fan service parts) or battle elements. Admitting, I have to say that some of the action bits improved while technical features such as visual quality died down. But ultimately, High School DxD Born is only a sporadically fun ride. It\u2019s not even half entertaining as the previous season and is designed to be quoted than watched.",

            "content": "~ Just poke her breast already! - Dragon ~\r\n[Pure Review: Anime Only]\r\nPrelude:\r\nThe prior seasons have been a \"big hit\" to say the least; drawing viewers from both the fantasy, and ecchi realms. \"Dragon of Dragon\" has always been a franchise in my eyes with more storytelling and character development talent than the marketing lets off. Do I even have to quote FUNimation's introduction to \"New\"? (\"more outrageous Oppai Battle Entertainment\"). The series has always retained a curious mixture of action, intensity, suspense, realism, and of course: Oppai... It's a combination that in theory should drown out any seriousness, and while it's by no means ashow to be taken deadly seriously; there are indeed some thrilling and suspenseful, passionately fought battles. Like a signature style for the show, DxD is one of the very few \"Lewd productions\"  that actually gets you to care somewhat about the characters and outcomes. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone came for the oppai (but some will try to convince you otherwise), and while many continue for the same reason, another would be that Issei is such a decent POV into this highly supernatural world. He's almost always in an enviable situation, but being naive, courageous, believable, and just downright hilarious at times - he's a very likable protagonist regardless.\\n\\n\r\nBorN:\\n\r\nAs the chronological continuation of High School DxD: New, High School DxD's third installment: BorN serves purely as additional anime content. It elaborates on the story from where we left off, introducing us to some new faces, developing existing faces, and creating an overriding sense of both progress and advancement. Following a similar formula as is shown in the previous seasons: Issei is once again battling alongside our beloved members of the Gremory household. He continues to deal with his devil career as the legendary red dragon, and we get front row seats!\\n\\n\r\nDxD fans will be pleased to know that BorN continues to integrate the signature style/charm (explained above): incorporating passion and intensity into a very mature natured (*wink wink*) product. It should be safe to say then, regardless of my upcoming judgement, that DxD fans will at the very least be able to connect with the continuation of our story.\\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion of \"New\" was relatively open-ended, and BorN delves straight back into the grand-scaled religious warfare. It wastes little time, and pretty much uses a shock tactic: a burst of contextual information regarding the complexities of what's to come - in order to immerse the viewer in this particular section of the story. From a dragon's destiny, to a comrade's fate: BorN factors in a lot of important content into these 12 episodes. New individuals make their presence and roles in the war known, and we get more documentation of how the Gremory household's members are growing as a result of experience. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some perilous situations in which death looms over an ally, to invoke suspense and prove that character attachment values are in fact \"a thing\" in DxD. There are epiphany-like milestones and other key events in BorN's plot that really do make and impact and shift your perception to a degree of the entire series. We get development for previously underdeveloped members such as Koneko, and even talk more about our protagonist's destiny.\\n\r\nClearly, you can't argue that there isn't enough SUBSTANCE to this third installment.\\n\\n\r\nAs the first DxD season to achieve a transformation of 3 whole volumes into anime form, it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that this is also BorN's greatest downfall. Now if non-stop action is your forte, then congratulations: you can disregard this review and get to watching right away. The rest of us can pick up on the fact that we have some blatent pacing issues to note here...\\n\\n\r\nWith such an amount of substantial story content being squeezed into a mere 240 (or so) minutes, things aren't covered quite as comprehensively as in the first two seasons. Operating on a smaller scale gave a greater sense of understanding and personality to \"DxD\" and \"New\", whereas \"BorN\" quite literally operates through time and space. It's generally a very broad and more documentative rather than POV feeling interpretation of events. This documentation of the religious war lacks, but does not completely disregard:\\n\\n\r\nExplanation - While a little slower to begin with, BorN quickly escalates through a series of events that shape the overriding plot. Whereas manga readers will not have problems with this, the sudden introduction of many characters - into the limelight for the first time, will somewhat live to confuse anime viewers. Besides \"That's X, and they do Y\", there's little answering the simple question of \"What's going on?\". For obvious reasons, this may reduce the viewers' ability to feel connected or passion toward the current happenings.\\n\\n\r\nSuspense - In spite of the highly perilous plot that DxD was covering this time around, another demerit of the \"rushing\" many have noted, is that there's a very limited amount of suspense that can be offered. In the prior seasons, there would a definite build up to an unexpected calamity - which left visible scars. The fast pace of BorN however doesn't allow for enough prolonging of these \"low-points\", to make them believable. \\n\\n\r\nThe presented obstacles were overcome too easily. Simply-put, it's like brushing off losing a limb... At no point did I really \"feel\" the suspense of the fact that i'm never going to walk again...\\n\\n\r\nPicking it back up though, and brushing it off... The show, not my leg...\\n\r\nIt did exist to significantly further my contextual understanding of the DxD-verse, and I was even able to enjoy the enhancement of characters both new and old. The chemistry is still great, the dialogue is still very enjoyable, the battles (particularly the earlier ones) were still very heated, and it is of course upholding its cheeky ecchi aspect alongside a lot of classic innuendo humor. Typical DxD 101 you might say.\\n\\n\r\nThe audiovisuals? If you insist...\\n\r\nI'd say that BorN retains a similarly high art standard: well-defined characters on atmospheric backgrounds. The character shading has room for improvement, as does one of the weaker elements - depth... But casual DxD fans are likely to just say \"Yeah, it's still pretty...\"\\n\\n\r\nThe score is a little \"flip-over-and-reuse\" from prior seasons, but I can't argue with the fact that it's both sentimental-feeling where appropriate, and intense where appropriate. With the addition of 2 AWESOME new sequences (OP & ED), i'd say that the audio aspect has become a strong suit.\\n\\n\r\nAccepting and willing DxD fans have nothing to lose by giving BorN a try. The story vividness is a little overly jeopardized for an anime - as a result of the pacing, but it brings forth a lot of relevant milestones and development to the table. While a little less impactual than the prior seasons, it's still an exhilarating and enjoyable thrill ride worth taking, brandishing that renowned DxD charm.\\n\\n\r\n~ Why don't you just poke both simultaneously?! - Rias ~\\n",

            "content": "My High School DxD BorN review.\r\nStory\r\nOk, so the 3rd sequel has just ended , frankly it's unfortunate that studio Genco and FUNimation didn't thought about making this sequel a 2nd season. tbh the 2nd sequel is bonkers, but I gotta say they did add some development with the 3rd sequel. However despite the developments I'm not gonna give the story category a high score, since it still rely on the MAc's sexual innuendo, also, the action plot may have become intense it still rely a lot from the MC getting his ass whooped when saving his harem.\r\nSo my verdict: a fair 6.\r\nArt \r\nLike the previoussequel, the anime still rely on the fanservice to sell and there is no explanation need , since sex sells in this anime and manga.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, my verdict: a Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nWhen it come to both the op and ed, I don't have much like for it, but I still like the VA's who did the character's voices like Rias, and Asia. Oh and I'm still not gonna give this category a high score.\\n\\n\r\nSo, my verdict: a Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nOk, so what we have here are a bunch of character's whose portrayals were a complete dichotomy  i.e.\\n\\n\r\nIssei Hyoudou, ok as usual, he is still pervert who wants to have a harem, but the dichotomy about him was that he's in love with Rias and yet he want's to be the Harem King, which basically conflicts his character as whole where he never makes any attempts to do his harem that this fool already has, which was quite annoying that form someone who wants to be the harem king despite of having a lot of girls sleeping naked besides him would still be a virgin.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRia Gremory, I always wonder if she is still in her teens or is she a hundred year old hag in the body of a teenage babe, let's not forget that in some of those flashbacks we see her meeting some of her servant whom are still very young while we see her the way she is. The dichotomy about her was that she loves Issei and yet she makes no attempts to keep some of the girls away from his man, the only attempt we saw her duking out for Issei's affection was with Akeno, but it never progress beyond it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAkeno Himejima, if there is any real competition for Issei's affection, it would be her, but the way she competes was nothing short of just a petty quarrel with her master Rias, then again just like Rias, she too never makes any attempts to take Issei away from Rias.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the girls, they too never make any attempts as well to competed for Issei's affection as well, but Asia is a waste, thought she is wife material for Issei she basically placed as mistress thingy, also there is Yuuto who wasn't even given a piece of the harem pie.\\n\\n\r\nAnother, just like the 2nd sequel , two new harem members get's added into the mix notably Rosswiess  and Irian who is now a full time member of the Issei's harem, which, aside from the dichotomy of the main characters, to sum it up, this anime category should have a low score but not that low.\\n\\n\r\nSo my verdict: a poor 3. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nSo far just like with the previous sequels, the only thing I  enjoy about this anime was the fanservice, and need I say more....maybe not, cu'z that's just the way I see it, so I hope you guys understand.\\n\\n\r\nMy verdict: a Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nI'm not gonna give this anime a high score, sure if you sum it up it should be a 7 or a 6, but that's not how I do it, not because I like something about the anime doesn't mean that I appreciate the anime as whole, the score I give to each category only applies to that category but the overall  is the top factor, so since this anime still relies a lot on the fanservice and with all that fancy cliche and dichotomy, my verdict for this anime as a whole would be.........\\n\\n\r\nMy overall verdict : a pathetic 1.\\n\\n\r\nPeace \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Okay, who else was hyped for this? I was, and so we're my buddies and you know what we got? Not the DxD we were hoping for... There will be SPOILERS, so if you haven't watched it, read someone else's review, screw mine.\r\nOkay, I can't see how terrible this season was. It's that bad compared to the first two. As a fan of the series, I was extremely unpleased with this forced plot and story.\r\nFirst, we meet Koneko's older sister, then it's revealed that the only way Koneko can become more powerful, she must use the powers she was born with. She is inclined tonever use them but later, she says Fuck It, I'll use them anyways for the plot's sake. Really? No real reason. What makes me more pissed than that was how for the sake of Issei's club harem, she starts to adore him due to plot once again. They never really had any development, I can't see how she would fall for Issei if she despised him in the first place. Duw to sake of the story, Issei instantly gets his BARANCU BUREEEEIIIIKAAAA, by poking Rias's nips and then blasts neko fanservice jugs. Vali comes in, says what's up, neko girl escapes with him, and they disappear. Why? What was the point in Vali coming, she could've said that she was in his little brigade of badasses and left.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the conflict. It's pathetic, oh look, Chaos Brigade strikes again. Loki attacks the united devils, angels, and fallen angels, but then gets jumped and smashed by Issei. Oh noes, devil dude wants Asia for himself, let's kidnap her in order for Issei to unlock more powers and force more development that they do not need. If the show needed more development between characters, go for Akeno or Xenovia, since they basically have no development, other than Akeno sucking dragon juices and Xenovia wanting to fuck. Moving on, Vali comes up to show off his already mastered powers once again, fucking JAGGANOTTU DURIBU, and bitch slaps Issei back into his senses and runs off again.\\n\\n\r\nLook, Asia's in trouble again, Issei comes in, beats up pussy noble devil, loses Asia again, gets salty, WABAAAAM, Vali comes in AGAIN, ''Yo man, found her in between dimensions.'' and jumps off to wherever he goes again. REALLY BRAH, when are you two gonna fight? Asia is saved and we have barely anymore episodes this season. Let's just have some foreshadow play now. A fake and extremely assertive Issei appears, magically seduces Rias, and somehow goes into a different dimension. Alright, let's go ask Master Vali how to get there. \\n\\n\r\nThey see Vali and they find out how they get there, hey, it's the descendant of King Arthur Pendragon, what's that sword you got here, a Holy Sword? It's not Excalibur? Ah yes, there was already a sword named that, so lets not give it its proper name. The damn sword is bullshit, it can cut open spaces into dimensions. LIKE THAT'S NOT DANGEROUS, RIGHT??? \\n\\n\r\nOkay, let's save Rias, oh noes, she's the Red Dragon Empress somehow. Issei, save her ass and get beaten at the same time for two episodes, hell yeah. Issei kicks his own ass or beats the imposter's right after. Rosswiess is still insignificant and is now the second Rook of team Rias. She serves as a teacher at their school, OH BOY, A CLUTS TEACHER, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? Dammit.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the whole season was wasted on saving Asia for god knows how many episodes. I'm really worried on the next season how it's gonna be. Now before you bombard me with ''Next season is not comfirmed'' shit, come on, its DxD, it will get one. Like how To Love Ru Darkness got a second season. Again, this season is not worth any time. If you're a diehard fan of DxD, go watch it. You'll come in with high hopes, and come out with lower. Otherwise, fuck this season. Plus, DxD is known for it's abundant fanservice, this season is lacking largely compared to the first two, that's a con. \\n\\n\r\nPros.\\n\r\n1. Issei becomes more badass of course.\\n\\n\r\nCons.\\n\r\n1. Forced plot\\n\r\n2. Issei VS Vali postponed for next season\\n\r\n3. Unnecessary Issei almost dying 3 times even though he's the protagonist and obviously he'll never die.\\n\r\n4. Pheonix Sister adores Issei.\\n\r\n5. Plot holes, a shit load of them.\\n\\n\r\nIt has a lot of cons, but it's DxD, it can get away with it easily, knowing it... I kind of trashed it, but I won't lie, it's still an alright show, and I'll look forward to a fourth season, I want to see Issei and Vali fight in their strongest form or see them ally together and defeat the Red Dragon God thing.\\n\\n\r\nOne way this season would've been better if Issei left the group and joined the Chaos Brigade and got stronger, kind of like Tokyo Ghoul when Taneki left the coffee place.",

Surely they are \"bobs\", \"harem\", \"e\u0441chi\" etc. Indeed, this title is full of such things. But this is on the one hand. On the other hand, we see rather beautiful title with interesting plot and developed universe.\r\nWe are used to think that ecchi is all about stamps, but this title brings something new to ecchi genre and that's why I like it.\r\nSurely, pantsu, boobs and nose bleeding are everywhere (what ecchi will exist without it?) but we stillhave the characters. Yes, they're typical women from the typical harem, but there stories are not confused. Each of them has individuality (even men). Each of them likes main character for their own reason, not because he's nice.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about main character, we can remember such guys from lots of ecchies and harems, but this one is different. He is helpful in every situation, though his thoughts are all about boobs. He will do whatever he need to do(remember the first season when he went to customers by bike).\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I can say that this title is based on really good characters that not every ecchi and even not every modern anime has. The plot is interesting too though we've seen this lots of times. So the score is 7.6 ~ 8. You should see it to know the difference between the average ecchi(which is not good) and good ecchi(wich is really good).",

The series was quite enjoyable, but not what wasexpected, 8/10.\\n\r\nAlthough those aspects received a good mark, the reason I gave it such a bad one (from my point of view, this mark could be considered appaling for such a masterpiece as DxD) were the following:\\n\r\nThe characters development were poor in the animation, but I could not give a mark in this just for bad decisions made by the studio, I had to consider the light novel's writer work as well, otherwise I would not be fair, 9/10.

Some people might not notice, but bugs and other things even worse were frequent during the whole series, mostly in the characters eyes, I would not be exagerating if I rated it horrible, 3/10.\\n\r\nI do not think you would see this series if you had not seen the prequels, so I would consider fair to watch it as a link from the second to the fourth season.\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nHope I helped.",

            "content": "It's not funny.\r\nBorN suffers from the grave offense of what I call \"miscalculated escalation,\" which unfortunately is just as big a problem in TV as haphazard genre-shifting. In tl;dr fashion, it's the cinematic equivalent of premature ejaculation. Here, it's the rapid ramping up of Issei's power in a way that completely obliterates the ceiling of believability (relative to the fact this is an anime about fat cartoon tiddies).\r\nFirst Issei is just a guy who loves boobies; then, he has a sweet arm that can do magic and stuff; that turns into a time-limited set of armor, along the way adopting the power to blast offwomen's clothes; from there he evolves into a super mega ultra giga turbo overblast nukatron armageddon apocalyptic colossus red dragon of supreme ass kicking that can utterly (udderly?) obliterate absolutely anything in the universe no problem no question don't worry about it. Oh but there's still like four episodes or whatever left, so now he's back to the set of armor but has some devil lasers on his back or someshit.\\n\\n\r\nThere's just nothing left that is as cool as an unhinged death dragon stomping around annihilating all in its path. Everything that comes after is boring and underwhelming comparatively, which is even more lame than the Issei dub actor going to prison for kiddie porn. The new actor's crappy skills are so mild next to the issues BorN has that I totally forgot I hated him about ten minutes in.\\n\\n\r\nBorN also sheds 95% of the humor from the first two series to go hand-in-hand with lame boob jokes that feel forced rather than natural. I don't know if it's different writers or what, but the whole intangible feel of the show is off-center so much that the change of voice talent is a non-issue. Even the fan service panty shots and jello kazonga sound effects are tacked on like an afterthought, which reminded me of the R-rated DVD cut of Live Free or Die Hard and all the off-screen F-bombs that were lazily edited on. \\n\\n\r\nIt's just boring and dumb. Worth watching? Yeah maybe, but there's no soul anymore.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nJugs, bazoongas, melons; no matter what they are called, breasts are a universal constant. Boobs bear the \u201cnectar of life,\u201d cause men and women alike to turn heads, and are something that everyone can get behind. High School DxD BorN, returning for a third season, believes the same, providing busts of the large, small, round, supple, and bodacious variety. Mammaries are a wonderful part of the world, and it is lovely to see them in anime or anywhere, but the question remains: for this one, is it enough? Can its smorgasbord of boobies keep itself afloatfrom start to finish? Sadly, no, the anime sinks where its brethren swam.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nHigh School DxD is a series famous for its ability to balance both its plot-centric and \u201cecchi\u201d material. Many moments even see a combination of the two halves \u2013 such as Issei\u2019s \u201cBoosto\u201d ability \u2013 that demonstrate how well it capitalizes on the elements at its disposal. High School DxD BorN continues the tale, but chooses to deviate from its safe formula when it worries less about maintaining balance and more about dramatic events. Specifically, the lack of proper explanation, the exclusion of purposeful \u201cecchi\u201d content, and the halfhearted exploration of sympathy prevent the show from having strength, resulting in a weak narrative that tarnishes the series\u2019 reputation.\\n\\n\r\nBorN\u2019s (the shortening of choice) first fault comes from failing to detail a lot of the aspects that it introduces. Strangely, the anime hardly ever encountered such an issue before, simply because it prioritized world-building. One example is the idea of characters being chess pieces, which is logical once the show explained the underworld\u2019s tendency to solve issues through games of a similar nature. BorN opts for a more confusing approach where the show actively seeks to avoid giving the necessary context to understand newly incorporated aspects. For instance, the \u201cChaos Brigade\u201d is an opposing force throughout the season, but their goals, motivations, and identities are never made explicitly clear. Consequently, many of the plot points, like Loki\u2019s betrayal and Red Dragon\u2019s appearance, lose meaning since the details making them relevant are missing. The anime might have been trying to keep the focus on Rias and the other girls\u2019 assets, which makes sense; at its core, BorN wants nothing more than to present uncensored boobs. But when the narrative includes occurrences like the swift appearance and exit of villains or the notion that willpower wins the day without also including reason, the plot goes from looking like eye-candy to looking like trash.\\n\\n\r\nMore garbage is found within BorN\u2019s second fault: the \u201cecchi\u201d moments rarely have a semblance of purpose beyond their superficial appeal. \u201cRarely\u201d was chosen because there are select instances where the anime uses the risqu\u00e9 as a catalyst to drive the plot. One of the earliest examples of this is Issei\u2019s first meeting with Kuroka where, to grant himself power, Issei plays with Rias\u2019s nipple. Another happens much later in the series, in the form of telepathy through boobs, thereby earning Issei and his team the upper hand. Both are ridiculous, but rather than the \u201cecchi\u201d existing just to exist it instead allows for the show to progress in a manner that is fun, arousing, and purposeful. In contrast, Rias in a devil outfit or Xenovia throwing herself at Issei are no doubt designed to be sexy but forget to mean much to the overall goals of the show. Asia\u2019s kidnapping situation showcases the worst of this, where her mistreatment and nakedness are byproducts of the scenario rather than the scenario coming about because of the \u201cecchi\u201d material. It is difficult to feel sympathy for the anime at this point because both halves \u2013 the plot and the \u201cecchi\u201d elements \u2013 fail to be understandable and purposeful, respectively.\\n\\n\r\nCoincidentally, sympathy is one of the anime\u2019s only notable facets. Sympathy, not empathy, because Issei recognizes their hardships, as opposed to experiencing their emotions. It is a theme that is not immediately apparent, since it is hidden behind the shapely boobs and misshapen plot. Essentially, each arc in BorN focuses on a particular member of the harem, with Issei aiding each girl in overcoming her particular issue. He protects Koneko from her sister, he pushes Akeno from her past, he rescues Asia from her stalker, and he saves Rias from herself. His constant awareness of the people around him demonstrates to a degree the efficacy of sympathy when each girl, regardless of the predicament she is placed in, is helped through her troubles. Nothing grandiose \u2013 this is a common theme in many anime \u2013 but at the minimum Issei does not do it alone; in nearly all circumstances the remaining cast is present, fighting alongside the boy who has already done so much for them. Ironically, their feelings are cared for and not their bodies, which goes against the \u201cecchi\u201d material. Therefore, the anime undermines its own ideals, serving somewhat as an explanation for the deterioration of the sexual and the narrative elements.\\n\\n\r\nBorN might have many chests to stare at, but the problems with its plot, \u201cecchi\u201d material, and themes are distracting enough to ruin whatever sequences it managed to piece together.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nBorN\u2019s art style is neither distinct nor captivating. The show\u2019s locations are limited, with mostly Issei\u2019s mansion, the school proper, and reddish, craggy parts of the underworld visited. Near the end, the characters even enter an interdimensional vortex where the background becomes vomit. The anime does pay extra attention to its breasts, with shadows, contours, and depressions accentuating them as highly as possible for maximum attractiveness.\\n\\n\r\nAttractiveness continues when the character designs remain almost exactly the same (to be expected) for the third season. Rias\u2019s flowing red hair, Akeno\u2019s long, black ponytail, and Koneko\u2019s shortness of both stature and locks return, each sporting their signature school attire. Rossweisse, a newcomer, is clad in grey and silver to match her older \u201cChristmas Cake\u201d status. Other people, like Loki and Lucifer, look the part with their regal clothes and armor despite having a small role in the festivities. Overall, the designs remain strong even years after their original conception.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, strength cannot be found in the show\u2019s actual animation. Simply put, it is poor. Scenes rife with action \u2013 such as when Issei powers up or when large-scale battles break out \u2013 see the bare minimum of fluidity, with choppy hammer swings and lame choreography. Casual scenarios likewise see stunted animation, with little movement of even the most common of actions. The exception, once again, are the breasts that litter the anime; the boobs bounce and boing in their boisterous bountifulness.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAlthough BorN has major issues in regards to its story and animation, a theme of transformation chains the cast members together, with a weak link threatening the tautness of the connection between them.\\n\\n\r\nThe formation of the chain begins early when Rias and her household decide to train themselves individually to improve their abilities. Issei works with a dragon master, Kiba develops his sword skills, and Koneko practices her punches, each vying to increase his or her capabilities. In other words, labor transforms the characters for the better. Transformation also occurs at the end when Rossweisse is invited to join the harem, but it is more a clever joke than an improvement of her person \u2013 she foregoes her Valhalla heritage to spite Odin\u2019s forgetting of her, but at this point she is \u201cjust another demon,\u201d meaning she will still be forgotten. Nevertheless, transformation establishes itself both at the beginning and the end of the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe start and the finish focus on transformation, and the same can be said of the middle. As was previously discussed, BorN contains roughly four arcs that each focus on a separate girl, namely: Koneko, Akeno, Asia, and Rias. For Koneko, besides learning more about her sibling, the audience discovers the origins of her power. Descending from a line of felines, she had always repressed her other half because she felt that accepting it would somehow cause her to become her twisted sister. But through Rias and Issei\u2019s sympathy, she comes to understand that change does not automatically bring hardship since one\u2019s friends and family will be there to support such a movement. Thus, Koneko transforms into the catlike person she had always been, and bringing with her a newfound sense of worth. Akeno also undergoes transformation, although it is mental rather than physical. Interestingly, the anime delves far into her past to show the death of her mother, the loneliness she experienced, and the hate she brewed for her father. Such hate was childish, though, since she did not fully comprehend the circumstances. Subsequently her present behavior towards her father was childish as well \u2013 ignoring him, pushing him away, and generally being rude to her only parent. But when she attempts to erase her past in an irrational manner, she looks deep inside herself to reach the rational conclusion that she was to blame for being alone, not her father. Therefore, while Akeno had always had the body of a woman, the reconciliation she went through allowed her mind to transform into a woman, too.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, the talk of transformation brings up a pressing question: why is Asia included on the list? After all, she has received a lot of focus during the prequels, most notably in the first season where she was reborn. Stranger still, she is sound of mind and pure of thought, with her knowing who she is, what she wants, and how she needs to act. In essence, Asia acts as a foil for the other girls since she does not need to transform, pronouncing to a higher degree the transformations that do take place. Comparing her difficulty to those of the other girls makes this more obvious; unlike Koneko, Akeno, and Rias, an outer influence attacks Asia rather than an inner struggle. So, while Asia is already a good and whole person, the counterintuitive angle taken expounds on this theme that much further.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Rias\u2019s obtuse transformation nearly rusts the chain. Throughout most of the season, Rias was what could only be described as jealous. Issei worrying for and helping out each girl other than Rias was not sitting comfortably with the president, with each new event slowly expanding the evil resting in her bosom. As the season heads towards the finale, she explodes, literally transforming from a motherly and kind leader into a despondent and angered villain. Donning dragon armor like Issei, all seems lost as she refuses (willingly or not) to come back to her senses. Issei eventually calls out to her, saving Rias from spelling her own doom, but the anime chooses to imply that she still holds these same feelings, just not to the extent that they once were. A devil\u2019s advocate would point out that this is another angle of transformation, that there are certain people who cannot transform as quickly and as easily as Koneko and Akeno did. Given that this is true, Rias\u2019s development throughout the season holds up well, but since the show chooses to have Issei conveniently forget the climax of her arc, it leaves the impression that Rias\u2019s feelings are not as important as they obviously should be.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme tries to be extravagant, both in voice and in instrument. But it is too much for the piece, with it collapsing upon itself due to the sporadic English words and all-over-the-place tone. The ending theme, in contrast, manages to be both fun and catchy, with the chorus, vocalist, and beat unifying to create a song that mirrors the happiness that can often be found in the series.\\n\\n\r\nHappy times are also found when the soundtrack is heard. Many of the tracks adopt weird sound effects, such as in \u201cShikou no Yuuwaku,\u201d that are designed to be silly so that they coincide with the slice-of-life moments. Other tracks, like \u201cOmoi.Sorezore,\u201d take into account the foreboding nature of the season, providing haunting arrangements that weigh on one\u2019s conscious. Others still, such as \u201cShouri,\u201d are quick and orchestral, pumping one\u2019s adrenaline to new heights. Perhaps the \u201cbest\u201d track of the bunch is \u201cOppai Dragon no Uta,\u201d with Issei chanting his love of dragons and boobs, amusing all who listen. As a small aside, the squishing sounds of the breasts as they move is a detail not needed but much appreciated. Thus, the OST spans a wide range of genres that fit the anime nicely, making it an all-around positive offering.\\n\\n\r\nA bit on the negative side, the voice acting for BorN is somewhere around average. While the show has everyone return to reprise their roles, there are neither exceptional nor appalling performances to speak of. However, a special shout-out is deserved for Yuuki Kaji as Issei for his screaming and pervert-esque voice.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI like Rias, and I like Akeno. I also like Asia, Xenovia, Koneko, Issei, and everyone else that the series has on the table. But this one was just not entertaining for me. The drama was lacking intensity, the comedy was not funny, and the amount of non-brooding Rias was disappointing. One of the worst offenses was the ED\u2019s visuals; the third ending theme did away with the sexy dancing that the first two championed, a decision that is nothing short of blasphemy. If anything, the uncensored boobs made the ride tolerable, but were definitely not enough to erase the troubles I had with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nHigh School DxD BorN brings the breasts, yet simultaneously goes against \u201cthree times the charm.\u201d Its mangled narrative, less-than-stellar art, and low value \u2013 in terms of emotion and laughter \u2013 are a bit too much to bear. While the characters are executed nicely and the soundtrack hits many notes, those aspects alone cannot prop this one up. Born it may be but beautiful it be not.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, not enough details surrounding the world, the \u201cecchi\u201d rarely has purpose, and the theme on sympathy is simultaneously consistent and undermining\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, boring art style, nice character designs, below average actual animation, with special care given to all of the breasts\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, a theme of transformation forms a chain between Koneko, Akeno, Asia, and Rias, with the latter rusting it slightly\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, bad OP, good ED, good soundtrack, about average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, pales in comparison to the first two seasons\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

            "content": "First off I want to say that I have never read any of the novel so this is an anime only review.\r\nHigh School DxD is one of those anime that I really want to love. When done correctly it can be funny, exciting and very very echii. I have all previous seasons and always end up rather disappointed. This new season though started out great but then suddenly went off the rails. \r\nSTORY: I've personally found the story in every season to be all over the place. This season started out different though. I really enjoyed the first half as it had moments of bigcrazy fights, shocking twists and some character development for several of the cast. I can't go into details but I can honestly say the first half of this season is really a joy to watch. If you come for just the echii moments, they are there but they weren't exaggerated. I think even the Issei has become used to walking around with every girl around him naked. He is still perverted though bless his heart. Some of the funnier moments come when he tries to fulfill his oppai fantasies, and all for a good reason. The second half, especially the final arc was a different story though. The story arcs lost any impact whatsoever. They managed to survive certain moments due to plain out miracles, or plot armor would be a better description. I really appreciate when an anime goes beyond belief and is brave enough to do something shocking. Very few do however, and those that do immediately eliminate it. Looking at you ALdnoah Zero. Anyways, my point is I would have enjoyed the final arcs more if they could keep any sense of danger, however everyone is miraculously fine. \\n\r\nAs I said I've never read any of the novelsbut I do keep an eye on comments. I did notice that while readers did have complaints with the first half, they were essentially fine with it because it was still entertaining. When I noticed myself getting bored and annoyed at the second half I went back and found every reader to be angry and upset at how the story was jumping around. That made everything make sense as to why the end felt like a big mess. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is good, not much to say really. The character designs are well done, The fighting scenes are exciting and the echi...well they know what they are doing. Nothing too overly impressive. I'm sure if you look at every scene frame by frame you could find problems but who does that? \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n  Lets start with the King herself....king piece...president Rias. I love Rias, I wish she could be better presented. I feel there is so much more to her than what we see. She's the type of person you'd be willing to devote your entire life serving at her side. That plus I like redheads....anyways....\\n\r\nThe one that stole the spotlight this season by far I feel was Koneko. We got to see more of her past, how she came to meet Rias. Plus she is just plain adorable at moments, while a badass at other moments. \\n\r\nAsia I'm going to admit I don't really like. She is the little sister of the group and that is fine, I simply find her too dull. It's no coincidence her role was bigger at the second half of the season. Plus she is sooo lucky. \\n\r\nThe rest didn't really have much to do this season. Akeno had a small personal arc that went nowhere. \\n\r\nRossweiss, though not enough screen time, was fun to watch and I am interested in seeing her in the future. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the fumble at the end, there were some enjoyable and memorable moments this season. You'll end the season thinking, \"that was it?\" There were good fights, funny moments, cute moments and the song oppai dragon automatically adds another point alone. So it was good, a step above decent. Would I suggest it to friends? Only if they are looking for something echii. If they care more about story though, I'd suggest something else",

You know the typical males in ecchi anime are usually weak, never execute, and act like they are allergic to women that approach them sexually. That doesn't exist here.\r\nIf the reasons outlined above don't already have you wanting to watch this, there is zerohope for you to ever get into the ecchi genre. Truly.\\n\\n\r\nOh and as a small tip, if you have the option available to you, do yourself a favor and watch the uncensored version of this anime. I never saw the censored TV version, but I just don't see how it's possible to grasp a major part of this anime with censoring.",

So season 4 is a must must happen no matter what.......\r\n1. We all know now DXD means Dragons Of Dragons. That answered part of it.\r\n2. Brewing romance of casts\r\n- Gasper & Koneko (coming of age sort of well his age is thousand years same goes with Koneko)..... who's older youdecide, bottomline, they are a match.\\n\r\n- Yuuto & Tsubaki, hottest guy in school and the other hottest girl (outside Rias herself & Akeno).\\n\r\n- Souua & Saji (same like Issei & Rias)\\n\r\n- Xenovia & Asia, lesbian anyone....\\n\r\n- Possible linkage Katase or Murayama to Motohama or Matsuda.\\n\\n\r\n3. The usual love triangles (who is the lover and who are the mistresses)\\n\r\n- Rias Issei Akeno\\n\r\nwell all the girls have a a romance towards Issei so 3, 4, 5 way.....\\n\\n\r\n4. The postponed duel of Issei & Vali.\\n\r\n5. Loki's revenge..... to think a prison can hold him for all eternity.\\n\r\n6. When where how will the Kaos Brigaide's next attack.......\\n\r\n7. Will Akeno finally reconcille with her father?\\n\r\n8. Will Rossweisse find her first love? I guess its Azazel..... they're both teachers / adults.\\n\r\n9. Will Koneko/Shirone turn her evil older sister Kuroka back to the good side?\\n\r\n10. Will Rias finally have a baby & Issei is the father?\\n\r\n11. Will the Red Dragon reveal his motives?\\n\r\n12. And will Issei finally have his Harem & be a Harem King? (although I think he already have it, he just make it a silly erotic perverted dream).\\n\\n\r\nQuite simillar to Seikon no Qwaser, breasts energized the hero. In Qwaser squeezing, fondling, flapping, licking, sucking breastmilk gives energy to the hero while DXD is all but no breastmilk. A cut through to hentai mode. Almost.\\n\\n\r\nToo bad there are no hentai versions of both animes, except Princess Lover. If there will be one..... I know it will be packed.",

            "content": "Umm...let me be honest here. I started watching High School DxD series because of the things it was good at: adequately mixing its overt fan-service with little bit of plot and good comedy. For me, if an anime is completely made of fan-service, it is not usually worth investing one's time. However, High School DxD is different in that it cleverly uses fan-service, not as a gratuitous method to attract viewers, but as an integral part of the entire story, which fits seamlessly in the big flow of things. Also, the comedy involving fan-service is a giant plus in watching this show.\r\nBut this third seasonHigh School DxD BorN sadly decided to cut down its use of its forte: the harmonious blend of boobs+comedy+the general flow of things. Instead it decides to focus more on the complex affairs of politics in the world of devils, dragons, Nordic gods, etc --- making the show feeling rather heavy and somber overall. So, in this season, we rarely see Issei and friends in the  real world and school life, but in other dimensions fighting gods and dragons.\\n\r\nI know, we can't always have school life and fan-service, because the affairs of the underworld and fighting gods is what differentiates this show from others. Otherwise, High School DxD would be just one of those slice of life harem fan service shows that are too common out there.\\n\r\nHowever, like I said earlier, I got into this series because of the good use of fan service+comedy and the warm and often light-hearted atmosphere. Here, I really misses the old times. I haven't read the original source material, but it was rather tiring to watch characters fighting and raging episode after episode. I gladly welcome those political stories for the sake of the plot, but too much of it might make High School DxD lose its identity.\\n\r\nI think - like Issei - many viewers crave some Oppai when they are watching High School DxD. I am not saying the show was bad, but it was just too repetitively gloomy and heavy at times.\\n\r\nNot everyone might agree, but that is my frank opinion of this third season.",

The main character's lust for boobs is what gives him all his power. Issei reaches a powerful form just because he poked his master's breasts. Plus, Koneko has some funny one liners in the show. The amount of breasts shown in this series is outrageous. In one episode I counted 35 pairs of breasts in one episode. Issei is usually put into awkward situations when breasts are out because the other girlsattack him. It usually ends up with him getting interrupted and leaving a laugh. For example, he gets attacked by girls while he is putting something in a shed. It ends up with him getting caught by an angel while he has his hands on some boobs. All the angel said was that they shouldn't be doing that in the shed because it is filthy.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the action is very good. Issei's heart in every battle is something special. He doesn't care about anything other than protecting his friends. The character is full of heart and does everything with such passion. When losing a friend he becomes full of hate and rage that he actually loses control and reaches such a powerful form that it almost kills him. The main character is a fool, along with a respectable person.\\n\\n\r\nGood show.",

High School DxD BorN is the third season of High School DxD, a franchise that has securely found it\u2019s place in otaku culture. If you do not know the story by now this is not the review for you. \r\nStory\r\nFollowing the events of season 2, Issei and company travel to the underworld to compete in a tournament between promising young devils. This tournament is what has become a staple ofthe franchise, a rating game. A rating game is an opportunity for devils to gain esteem and fame in the underworld as well as to gain ranks in the devil hierarchy. However events do not go as planned, the Gremory family get involved and as usual have to save the day.\\n\\n\r\n Besides the fanservice what I find the most interesting about the franchise is the mechanics of the underworld and the hierarchy that exists. There is surprisingly a large amount of detail and depth put into the rankings, the families, strategy all of which can be pretty overwhelming. What bothered me this season was that there was little to no mention of these mechanics because the tournament that was supposed to happen, never really happens but instead gets rudely interrupted. \\n\\n\r\n This season introduces Norse Mythology to the series. Recently I have been watching a tv show called Vikings on History and have become infatuated with all things Norse. I was happy to see how certain plot elements were taken from Norse mythology, albeit with an anime twist. Who knows, you might learn something. Head count, we now have Devils, Angels, Fallen Angels, norse gods and... cat girls? Yes I said it, nyaa! \\n\\n\\n\r\n Characters\\n\\n\r\nThis season in particular puts particular emphasis on the other females in Issei\u2019s harem, Koneko, Akeno and Asia. Of the three I felt that Koneko\u2019s was more interesting because it introduced backstory to the character similar to Kiba in season 2. Speaking of which I always wondered how Kiba feels about having every female member of his family fawning over Issei. There are hints of a possible love interest for Kiba, so have fun looking for it because it only lasts a second. Koneko attitude towards Issei somewhat takes a complete 180, instead of acting tsundere Koneko now wears her feelings on her sleeve for him. Looking back I still do not feel that this was not deserved and only served to satisfy a certain anthropomorphic trope. \\n\\n\r\n Many new characters are introduced to the show adding to the intrigue. One character that I didn\u2019t understand why was even introduced was a valkyrie called Rossweisee. Rossweisee serves Odin, is incredibly beautiful and constantly complains about not having a boyfriend. She has no purpose to the story and as of yet has no relationship to Issei. \\n\\n\r\n Issei this season is his usual overpowered, oppai loving self. What I found interesting early on was Issei recollection of a certain painful event that occurred during the first episode of the franchise. It answers the question as to why Issei doesn\u2019t choose one girl, perhaps why his relationship with Rias never goes anywhere further. The conclusion of the season addresses this plot point, Issei recognizes this fault, however Rias and the other girls of the harem seem to have no idea so it is never fully resolved.\\n\\n\\n\r\n Animation and Sound\\n\\n\r\nDespite being a show filled with demons and fallen angels, Highschool DxD always finds a way to visually pop off the screen with it\u2019s contrasting color palette and art style. There is a noticeable lack of quality this season as compared to season 2. This is typical of a series in it\u2019s 3rd season and is to be expected. It\u2019s not a deal breaker so long as you keep your expectations low.\\n\r\nThe music this season is largely a disappointment. The words forgettable, boring, typical comes to mind. I found myself constantly skipping the opening and ending. Nothing this season particularly stands to mind.\\n\\n\\n\r\n Final Verdict\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nFanservice: infinity /10\\n\r\nEnjoyment:7.5/10\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOf the three seasons so far, High School DxD BorN is by far the weakest. However I was able to watch the entire series in 1 weekend, therefore I still enjoyed the show despite it\u2019s faults. If you have seen the first 2 seasons, I would say you should watch BorN but with the caveat of keeping your expectations low. The fanservice and comedy is abundant, yet the plot especially towards to end of the series drags. The plot drags to such a degree that much of the drama introduced never gets fully resolved. The whole season feels as though it\u2019s filler or set up for possible future seasons.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final note, I first started watching this season when it was first airing and stopped due to all the censors (for obvious reasons). It has been less than 2 months since the series stopped airing and I was able to watch the entire season uncensored. Don\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t faint from loss of blood due to excess nosebleeds.",

I'll go as far to say that many reviews that are low scored here were written without watching the anime and with the sole purpose to drag down shows they don't like as many of them seem to be have been written with their feet.\r\nSTORY:\r\nDxD continues with the now third season of Born were the Light Novel is closely followed into the settlement that comes after the three factions Angels, Fallens andDemons are trying to set up camp and discuss further matter of the New Faction that seeks to destroy relations between the humans and the joined supernatural.\\n\\n\r\nSome chapters were switched as many Light Novel readers are aware of and Icchei Ishibumi along with TNK decided to throw us the fans a twist, More of a foreshadowing for those who have yet to read Volume 20.\\n\\n\r\nThe arc here presents Loki and The Infinite Dragon God meddling with the three factions and wether there was some tweaking to a fourth season it's on the air. \\n\\n\r\nDid it work?, Absolutely but i must warned you if you're a Light Novel reader you might be slightly pissed off towards the end as you can't no longer predict what will happen next as new things are thrown our way.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nI have no complains, The art was astounding and easy to take in.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe Intro and ED theme are astounding, The voice actors on Japanese are on their A Game and the OST are on point. For the Dubbing however we lost the voice actors for Issei and Akeno. The new actor for Issei it's alright you can hear he tries and the acting is by no means mediocre, Akeno on the other hand it's a bit off.\\n\\n\r\nShe sounds too nice and you can't feel the sadism the previous one portrayed so well. The rest of the cast are back.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nFurther elaboration is all i have to say, We learn about Akenos past and this somewhat breaks the image we all had of her and we see her soft side. Many  characters go in depth so he action varies and the ecchi scenes are maintained but since Akeno is down for the count due to emotional reasons since the person she despise showed up the level we all enjoy of teasing Akeno dishes out is reduced.\\n\\n\r\nA new character makes a debut and she it's from the North Myth to the Occult Club.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis season was enjoyable and with subjective perspective wether what you anticipated being changed sat well with you or not. DxD continues to be the top Ecchi anime in existence.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThe third season was amazing however the chances of people that don't read the light novel enjoying it further than those who do it's about 70%, No fan base likes having the material they now so well be discarded for a change after all.",

            "content": "As I predicted in my preview review, here we have the third installment of this almost-hentai series. Though I have no idea what the \"Born\" in the title actually means (season 2 was \"New\" so maybe new-born?), it's a good continuation of what we've seen so far from the franchise and its ever-increasing scope and ever-growing harem.\r\nSo now that the angels, fallen angels, and demons have supposedly set aside their differences, we now learn that this is only a small fraction of all spiritual/non-human beings. This season introduces Norse-based entities including Valkyrie and Thunder-wielding gods. How will this new faction affect the new and fragilealliance? Will we have an all-out melee?\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation style hasn't changed much from the second season, the coloring is pretty much identical and you still get more action and ecchi for your time than most other shows. The setting does change a bit though, whereas the original was rooted mostly in the Earth realm, the majority of this season takes place in demon world, and you get to see the Gremory estate for the first time. As for characters, the show brings in a lot of new characters while still giving some cameos to the supporting cast of previous seasons.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned, expect plenty of action in this show. Issei takes his dragon armor to new heights and you'll see plenty of fighting be it with melee or magical attacks. There's a fair amount of blood as well, not really a departure from previous iterations of the show. As for ecchi, I've forgotten how high the ecchi level is in this show, I was quickly reminded with the almost constant topless nudity. This is definitely not a show to bring to work. Expect all sorts of ecchi ranging from blatant seduction to fondling. I mean come on, the main protagonist powers up by poking his master's breasts.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThough not quite as good as the original OP, the third OP is a definite improvement from the previous seasons. It's a fast paced piece that is fitting for the action-based show, with a decent main melody too. The ED is a fun, playful piece that works well for the ecchi aspect of the show. The BGM is supportive and pretty wide ranged, from playful instrumentals to heavily string-based fight tunes. There are a few familiar melodies carried over from previous seasons.\\n\\n\r\nThe veteran VA cast is carried over from the previous seasons and they deliver as expected. There are possibly more moaning and ecchi-based utterances than even some hentai works. I still find Ayana Taketatsu's role as Koneko interesting as her usual roles are a lot more boisterous. Expect the original harem members (Youko Hikasa, Azumi Asakura, Shizuka Itou, and Ayana Taketatsu) to receive the most screen time.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThere really is only a single main plot that spans the entirety of the season, with multiple mini subplots to thicken the brew. Basically, the group migrates to the demon world to receive training. While they're there, the entire Norse mythology thing is introduced and stuff starts going awry. Overall, the season is pretty entertaining, with a lot of cliffhangers and interesting twists. The show does build to a fitting climax and resolution, but still leaves a lot of open questions no doubt to be explored in future works. The actual climax is also not as well developed as that in the previous season, it somehow feels more like an afterthought.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a bit more of a focus on Koneko and her past in the first half of the season, while the second half sheds a bit more light on the whole dragons theme. As with previous seasons, expect to hear \"boost\" a great deal. Despite his ever-boosted power, Issei does feel a lot weaker than I remember him being- expect him to be beaten up a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThough the story was still entertaining, it didn't contribute nearly as much to the overall world as I would have expected. Rather than exploring existing open questions like what are the goals and motivations of the Chaos Brigade's members the show attempts to distract you with even more girls and oh look there's Thor's hammer. I guess I shouldn't expect so much given the amount of budget that probably went into drawing bouncy breasts.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nMy sentiments for this category echo what I said in the second season. There's definitely less character development than I'd like; I was also pretty wrong in my belief that the \"new\" girls from the second season would play a significant role here. Though Issei does get a ton of skinship with the harem members, the new girls of this season and season two don't get as much development as they deserve. I actually feel obliged to quote my last review: \"If there's anything to complain about, it's that some of the new characters feel kind of thrown in artificially as if it were a last minute decision to include them; they feel completely underutilized and underdeveloped.\" They totally did not fix this issue in this season.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're just in it to see cute girls in softcore porn then I guess none of the above really matters.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nDxD strikes an interesting balance between the action of a shonen show and the lustful appeal of a hentai piece. A lot of times, hybrids of the sort don't really work; this is one of those nice exceptions in which it does. While the show isn't going to win any prizes for depth of plot or characters, the raw entertainment value is pretty good. This latest iteration is a brainless but entertaining way to kill some time and reconnect with an interesting cast. It's not as strong as the last season but still recommended for those who enjoyed previous seasons.",

Surely they are \"bobs\", \"harem\", \"e\u0441chi\" etc. Indeed, this title is full of such things. But this is on the one hand. On the other hand, we see rather beautiful title with interesting plot and developed universe.\r\nWe are used to think that ecchi is all about stamps, but this title brings something new to ecchi genre and that's why I like it.\r\nSurely, pantsu, boobs and nose bleeding are everywhere (what ecchi will exist without it?) but we stillhave the characters. Yes, they're typical women from the typical harem, but there stories are not confused. Each of them has individuality (even men). Each of them likes main character for their own reason, not because he's nice.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about main character, we can remember such guys from lots of ecchies and harems, but this one is different. He is helpful in every situation, though his thoughts are all about boobs. He will do whatever he need to do(remember the first season when he went to customers by bike).\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I can say that this title is based on really good characters that not every ecchi and even not every modern anime has. The plot is interesting too though we've seen this lots of times. So the score is 7.6 ~ 8. You should see it to know the difference between the average ecchi(which is not good) and good ecchi(wich is really good).",

            "content": "I\u2019m sure by now, High School DxD is a franchise that needs little introduction. There\u2019s little reason that anyone should begin watching the third season without watching the previous series. That\u2019s like reading a book backwards from the last chapter. The thing about the High School DxD franchise is that we have a perverted main character named Issei. Then, there\u2019s a whole horde of harem characters ranging from lovely ouju-samas, a pure innocent blonde, a loli cat with the strength of Hercules, and even an Angel. The math is pretty simple to do. Issei wants to add all of them to his harem formula. However,unlike most harem series that ventures down a road of non-sense, High School DxD actually has a plot. As shocking as it may be, this harem show does actually have plot as the previous seasons proved itself to be actually effective. But unfortunately for High School DxD Born, effective has become a word of the past.\\n\\n\r\nDirected by Tetsuya Yanagisawa, the third season wastes little time to get straight to the point. In fact, the title itself suggest the tone with the word \u2018Born\u2019. For those who can guess it, it\u2019s basically an indirect reference at the way boobs sounds like when they bounce around. I guess by anime logic that means we\u2019ll see a lot of that both to satisfy fans\u2019 needs and plot purposes. With all the buildup and events that leads from one point to another, the third season tries to seize the moment to capitalize on the story. The key word here is \u201ctry\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nStarting from the first few episodes, there\u2019s already a lot going on. Discreetly, we can see that there\u2019s something going on with Koneko that\u2019s bothering her. Similarly enough, the show also reveals more events relating to Chaos Brigade as well as new antagonists. For Koneko, we also see a new girl that wants to take her back by any means until Issei and his group intervenes. Then, there\u2019s other ominous foreshadowing with characters such as Akeno. To say the least, the show can actually be thrilling when it develops these little bits and bits of scenarios like pieces to a puzzle. And any fan of High School DxD can expect, fan service returns as well with boobs, ass, and seductiveness. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the series has a promising start, it wavers down as the story progresses. I have read the light novels and the adaptations is not something that should be impressed by. Not only does the anime omits some appealing elements, it also fails to capture the point of the show especially in the second half. For what\u2019s worth, the series went backwards on itself when it comes to story focus. While the first half of the series adds excitement with the conflicts in the supernatural world, it loses steam almost entirely later on. I say this because the show\u2019s story turns messy with too many events happening and rapid resolutions. The plus side is that characterization retains a somewhat decent degree. But when it comes to storytelling, the third season pummels down the drain. For fans eager for some comedy though, you\u2019ll probably get a good dose out of it from one of Issei\u2019s new bizarre abilities that really emphasizes the \u2018Born\u2019 part of the title.\\n\\n\r\nThe main success of the third season is probably the characters. We have a very diverse and colorful range of characters. Ranging from the return of Issei and the Occult Research Club members to newly introduced characters such as Rossweisse, Odin, Kuroka, and Loki, the show captures the interest of its viewers when we want to see how their roles in the story. As some may guess though, Issei is still the main interest of the show as almost every episode still gives him a prominent role. This includes but not limited to saving from Koneko from her own self despair, giving Akeno the support she needs, or fighting against those he perceives as evil. As stereotypical as he can be, Issei does attract a good degree of honor as even characters such as Vali sees his purpose. However, the characterization doesn\u2019t grow beyond than that as there\u2019s too much happening for this one cour adaptation. Characters such as Ravel returns but hardly gains any spotlight. Rossweisse also makes little impact because of her sensitive personality (notice how she always thinks about how she may never get a boyfriend?). It\u2019s things like this that doesn\u2019t make first impression about a character. Although for perverted characters like Issei, her Valkyrie outfit is another story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s really holding the series back though ultimately comes down to execution. In terms of buildups, the show knows what it\u2019s doing. The characters introduced all show a degree of their personality that let anime only viewers anticipate what they may do next. However, the execution is cheesy. Remember the events of the first season about Asia nearly getting killed? Or the time when there\u2019s fear that Issei\u2019s feelings may never reach Rias? Yeah, we\u2019ve seen that before and the third season wastes time again to exploit these themes. Also for whatever reason, the third season ultimately takes a route that is very clich\u00e9 to the core. As gimmicky as High School DxD Born already is, this season really just doesn\u2019t seem to keep up the momentum it has built. This isn\u2019t just based on adaptation content but also the way the final few episodes are structured. It\u2019s the lack of fun that results from this season\u2019s experimentations that ultimately doesn\u2019t live up to the hype. On the plus side though, there is still uncensored fan service for the fans. The emotional angles can be touching on occasions as High School DxD still retains a level of interest with its other characters. In retrospect though, this season is a very hit or miss for fans. For me, it\u2019s much more of the miss.\\n\\n\r\nAs for technical aspects, there\u2019s not much improvement for artwork. TNK Entertainment still handles the visual quality although there are hardly any changes to the environment of the show. The action is fun to watch on most terms with fine degrees of clever coordination. Unlike previous seasons, High School DxD born features much more of the supernatural world that is decorated to a fine degree to spark the fantasy atmosphere. The dragons, devil, demons, and all sorts of species you wouldn\u2019t find anywhere is convincingly appealing. Then, there\u2019s also the designs of the new characters such as Rosseweisse with her business-like and attractive Valkyrie battle outfit. Kuroka\u2019s catlike dress is also alluring with its suggestive features while we also get modified and enhanced versions of Issei\u2019s Boosted Gear. And at the center of it all, it\u2019s the fan service. Surprisingly, it\u2019s tamer than the previous season although it still seizes opportunities to show skin when it has the chance. Bedroom scenes, dress break, and clever camera angles are its trademarks. Any fan of the franchise shouldn\u2019t be surprised by now as fan service has always been this series\u2019 flagship. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is moderate and there\u2019s nothing really to say much about it. In fact, the ED theme song that fans hope to see an improvement on really doesn\u2019t live up to its expectations. I guess it\u2019s perhaps the first season set the bar too high? Then again, soundtrack is one of the lesser noticeable features of the show. By OST context, the series delivers on most parts with its action features. When it comes to the emotional scenes, it stays honest and has the vulnerability that is convincing. However, that\u2019s pretty much the only impression about it. Character voice mannerisms aren\u2019t really impressive for our new characters. It\u2019s gimmicky to the core with Kuroka\u2019s \u2018nya\u2019, Odin\u2019 ego, or Rossewisse\u2019s nervousness. There\u2019s even less of the suggestive moans and ahhs fans may be eager to hear out of the headphones.\\n\\n\r\nHigh School DxD Born tries far too hard to make it look cool. Fans wants to see a fun, thrilling, and story that matches the momentum it has built. But what do we get instead? A clump of mess that digs itself deeper with inconsistency. Rushing and omitting parts is one thing but following down another road is another. As a 1 cour adaptation, it\u2019s hard to salvage from its mistakes. From my perspective, the show tries to be far too serious as it should be. High School DxD has always been a show that mixes together plot, characters, and most importantly adding fun excitement. It\u2019s almost if it\u2019s self-aware and a main point of the third season never focuses on that point. That being said, you may still get some satisfaction out of the comedy (mostly fan service parts) or battle elements. Admitting, I have to say that some of the action bits improved while technical features such as visual quality died down. But ultimately, High School DxD Born is only a sporadically fun ride. It\u2019s not even half entertaining as the previous season and is designed to be quoted than watched.",

            "content": "~ Just poke her breast already! - Dragon ~\r\n[Pure Review: Anime Only]\r\nPrelude:\r\nThe prior seasons have been a \"big hit\" to say the least; drawing viewers from both the fantasy, and ecchi realms. \"Dragon of Dragon\" has always been a franchise in my eyes with more storytelling and character development talent than the marketing lets off. Do I even have to quote FUNimation's introduction to \"New\"? (\"more outrageous Oppai Battle Entertainment\"). The series has always retained a curious mixture of action, intensity, suspense, realism, and of course: Oppai... It's a combination that in theory should drown out any seriousness, and while it's by no means ashow to be taken deadly seriously; there are indeed some thrilling and suspenseful, passionately fought battles. Like a signature style for the show, DxD is one of the very few \"Lewd productions\"  that actually gets you to care somewhat about the characters and outcomes. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone came for the oppai (but some will try to convince you otherwise), and while many continue for the same reason, another would be that Issei is such a decent POV into this highly supernatural world. He's almost always in an enviable situation, but being naive, courageous, believable, and just downright hilarious at times - he's a very likable protagonist regardless.\\n\\n\r\nBorN:\\n\r\nAs the chronological continuation of High School DxD: New, High School DxD's third installment: BorN serves purely as additional anime content. It elaborates on the story from where we left off, introducing us to some new faces, developing existing faces, and creating an overriding sense of both progress and advancement. Following a similar formula as is shown in the previous seasons: Issei is once again battling alongside our beloved members of the Gremory household. He continues to deal with his devil career as the legendary red dragon, and we get front row seats!\\n\\n\r\nDxD fans will be pleased to know that BorN continues to integrate the signature style/charm (explained above): incorporating passion and intensity into a very mature natured (*wink wink*) product. It should be safe to say then, regardless of my upcoming judgement, that DxD fans will at the very least be able to connect with the continuation of our story.\\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion of \"New\" was relatively open-ended, and BorN delves straight back into the grand-scaled religious warfare. It wastes little time, and pretty much uses a shock tactic: a burst of contextual information regarding the complexities of what's to come - in order to immerse the viewer in this particular section of the story. From a dragon's destiny, to a comrade's fate: BorN factors in a lot of important content into these 12 episodes. New individuals make their presence and roles in the war known, and we get more documentation of how the Gremory household's members are growing as a result of experience. \\n\\n\r\nThere are some perilous situations in which death looms over an ally, to invoke suspense and prove that character attachment values are in fact \"a thing\" in DxD. There are epiphany-like milestones and other key events in BorN's plot that really do make and impact and shift your perception to a degree of the entire series. We get development for previously underdeveloped members such as Koneko, and even talk more about our protagonist's destiny.\\n\r\nClearly, you can't argue that there isn't enough SUBSTANCE to this third installment.\\n\\n\r\nAs the first DxD season to achieve a transformation of 3 whole volumes into anime form, it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that this is also BorN's greatest downfall. Now if non-stop action is your forte, then congratulations: you can disregard this review and get to watching right away. The rest of us can pick up on the fact that we have some blatent pacing issues to note here...\\n\\n\r\nWith such an amount of substantial story content being squeezed into a mere 240 (or so) minutes, things aren't covered quite as comprehensively as in the first two seasons. Operating on a smaller scale gave a greater sense of understanding and personality to \"DxD\" and \"New\", whereas \"BorN\" quite literally operates through time and space. It's generally a very broad and more documentative rather than POV feeling interpretation of events. This documentation of the religious war lacks, but does not completely disregard:\\n\\n\r\nExplanation - While a little slower to begin with, BorN quickly escalates through a series of events that shape the overriding plot. Whereas manga readers will not have problems with this, the sudden introduction of many characters - into the limelight for the first time, will somewhat live to confuse anime viewers. Besides \"That's X, and they do Y\", there's little answering the simple question of \"What's going on?\". For obvious reasons, this may reduce the viewers' ability to feel connected or passion toward the current happenings.\\n\\n\r\nSuspense - In spite of the highly perilous plot that DxD was covering this time around, another demerit of the \"rushing\" many have noted, is that there's a very limited amount of suspense that can be offered. In the prior seasons, there would a definite build up to an unexpected calamity - which left visible scars. The fast pace of BorN however doesn't allow for enough prolonging of these \"low-points\", to make them believable. \\n\\n\r\nThe presented obstacles were overcome too easily. Simply-put, it's like brushing off losing a limb... At no point did I really \"feel\" the suspense of the fact that i'm never going to walk again...\\n\\n\r\nPicking it back up though, and brushing it off... The show, not my leg...\\n\r\nIt did exist to significantly further my contextual understanding of the DxD-verse, and I was even able to enjoy the enhancement of characters both new and old. The chemistry is still great, the dialogue is still very enjoyable, the battles (particularly the earlier ones) were still very heated, and it is of course upholding its cheeky ecchi aspect alongside a lot of classic innuendo humor. Typical DxD 101 you might say.\\n\\n\r\nThe audiovisuals? If you insist...\\n\r\nI'd say that BorN retains a similarly high art standard: well-defined characters on atmospheric backgrounds. The character shading has room for improvement, as does one of the weaker elements - depth... But casual DxD fans are likely to just say \"Yeah, it's still pretty...\"\\n\\n\r\nThe score is a little \"flip-over-and-reuse\" from prior seasons, but I can't argue with the fact that it's both sentimental-feeling where appropriate, and intense where appropriate. With the addition of 2 AWESOME new sequences (OP & ED), i'd say that the audio aspect has become a strong suit.\\n\\n\r\nAccepting and willing DxD fans have nothing to lose by giving BorN a try. The story vividness is a little overly jeopardized for an anime - as a result of the pacing, but it brings forth a lot of relevant milestones and development to the table. While a little less impactual than the prior seasons, it's still an exhilarating and enjoyable thrill ride worth taking, brandishing that renowned DxD charm.\\n\\n\r\n~ Why don't you just poke both simultaneously?! - Rias ~\\n",

            "content": "My High School DxD BorN review.\r\nStory\r\nOk, so the 3rd sequel has just ended , frankly it's unfortunate that studio Genco and FUNimation didn't thought about making this sequel a 2nd season. tbh the 2nd sequel is bonkers, but I gotta say they did add some development with the 3rd sequel. However despite the developments I'm not gonna give the story category a high score, since it still rely on the MAc's sexual innuendo, also, the action plot may have become intense it still rely a lot from the MC getting his ass whooped when saving his harem.\r\nSo my verdict: a fair 6.\r\nArt \r\nLike the previoussequel, the anime still rely on the fanservice to sell and there is no explanation need , since sex sells in this anime and manga.\\n\\n\r\nTherefore, my verdict: a Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nWhen it come to both the op and ed, I don't have much like for it, but I still like the VA's who did the character's voices like Rias, and Asia. Oh and I'm still not gonna give this category a high score.\\n\\n\r\nSo, my verdict: a Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nOk, so what we have here are a bunch of character's whose portrayals were a complete dichotomy  i.e.\\n\\n\r\nIssei Hyoudou, ok as usual, he is still pervert who wants to have a harem, but the dichotomy about him was that he's in love with Rias and yet he want's to be the Harem King, which basically conflicts his character as whole where he never makes any attempts to do his harem that this fool already has, which was quite annoying that form someone who wants to be the harem king despite of having a lot of girls sleeping naked besides him would still be a virgin.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRia Gremory, I always wonder if she is still in her teens or is she a hundred year old hag in the body of a teenage babe, let's not forget that in some of those flashbacks we see her meeting some of her servant whom are still very young while we see her the way she is. The dichotomy about her was that she loves Issei and yet she makes no attempts to keep some of the girls away from his man, the only attempt we saw her duking out for Issei's affection was with Akeno, but it never progress beyond it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAkeno Himejima, if there is any real competition for Issei's affection, it would be her, but the way she competes was nothing short of just a petty quarrel with her master Rias, then again just like Rias, she too never makes any attempts to take Issei away from Rias.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the girls, they too never make any attempts as well to competed for Issei's affection as well, but Asia is a waste, thought she is wife material for Issei she basically placed as mistress thingy, also there is Yuuto who wasn't even given a piece of the harem pie.\\n\\n\r\nAnother, just like the 2nd sequel , two new harem members get's added into the mix notably Rosswiess  and Irian who is now a full time member of the Issei's harem, which, aside from the dichotomy of the main characters, to sum it up, this anime category should have a low score but not that low.\\n\\n\r\nSo my verdict: a poor 3. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nSo far just like with the previous sequels, the only thing I  enjoy about this anime was the fanservice, and need I say more....maybe not, cu'z that's just the way I see it, so I hope you guys understand.\\n\\n\r\nMy verdict: a Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nI'm not gonna give this anime a high score, sure if you sum it up it should be a 7 or a 6, but that's not how I do it, not because I like something about the anime doesn't mean that I appreciate the anime as whole, the score I give to each category only applies to that category but the overall  is the top factor, so since this anime still relies a lot on the fanservice and with all that fancy cliche and dichotomy, my verdict for this anime as a whole would be.........\\n\\n\r\nMy overall verdict : a pathetic 1.\\n\\n\r\nPeace \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Okay, who else was hyped for this? I was, and so we're my buddies and you know what we got? Not the DxD we were hoping for... There will be SPOILERS, so if you haven't watched it, read someone else's review, screw mine.\r\nOkay, I can't see how terrible this season was. It's that bad compared to the first two. As a fan of the series, I was extremely unpleased with this forced plot and story.\r\nFirst, we meet Koneko's older sister, then it's revealed that the only way Koneko can become more powerful, she must use the powers she was born with. She is inclined tonever use them but later, she says Fuck It, I'll use them anyways for the plot's sake. Really? No real reason. What makes me more pissed than that was how for the sake of Issei's club harem, she starts to adore him due to plot once again. They never really had any development, I can't see how she would fall for Issei if she despised him in the first place. Duw to sake of the story, Issei instantly gets his BARANCU BUREEEEIIIIKAAAA, by poking Rias's nips and then blasts neko fanservice jugs. Vali comes in, says what's up, neko girl escapes with him, and they disappear. Why? What was the point in Vali coming, she could've said that she was in his little brigade of badasses and left.\\n\\n\r\nNext, the conflict. It's pathetic, oh look, Chaos Brigade strikes again. Loki attacks the united devils, angels, and fallen angels, but then gets jumped and smashed by Issei. Oh noes, devil dude wants Asia for himself, let's kidnap her in order for Issei to unlock more powers and force more development that they do not need. If the show needed more development between characters, go for Akeno or Xenovia, since they basically have no development, other than Akeno sucking dragon juices and Xenovia wanting to fuck. Moving on, Vali comes up to show off his already mastered powers once again, fucking JAGGANOTTU DURIBU, and bitch slaps Issei back into his senses and runs off again.\\n\\n\r\nLook, Asia's in trouble again, Issei comes in, beats up pussy noble devil, loses Asia again, gets salty, WABAAAAM, Vali comes in AGAIN, ''Yo man, found her in between dimensions.'' and jumps off to wherever he goes again. REALLY BRAH, when are you two gonna fight? Asia is saved and we have barely anymore episodes this season. Let's just have some foreshadow play now. A fake and extremely assertive Issei appears, magically seduces Rias, and somehow goes into a different dimension. Alright, let's go ask Master Vali how to get there. \\n\\n\r\nThey see Vali and they find out how they get there, hey, it's the descendant of King Arthur Pendragon, what's that sword you got here, a Holy Sword? It's not Excalibur? Ah yes, there was already a sword named that, so lets not give it its proper name. The damn sword is bullshit, it can cut open spaces into dimensions. LIKE THAT'S NOT DANGEROUS, RIGHT??? \\n\\n\r\nOkay, let's save Rias, oh noes, she's the Red Dragon Empress somehow. Issei, save her ass and get beaten at the same time for two episodes, hell yeah. Issei kicks his own ass or beats the imposter's right after. Rosswiess is still insignificant and is now the second Rook of team Rias. She serves as a teacher at their school, OH BOY, A CLUTS TEACHER, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? Dammit.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the whole season was wasted on saving Asia for god knows how many episodes. I'm really worried on the next season how it's gonna be. Now before you bombard me with ''Next season is not comfirmed'' shit, come on, its DxD, it will get one. Like how To Love Ru Darkness got a second season. Again, this season is not worth any time. If you're a diehard fan of DxD, go watch it. You'll come in with high hopes, and come out with lower. Otherwise, fuck this season. Plus, DxD is known for it's abundant fanservice, this season is lacking largely compared to the first two, that's a con. \\n\\n\r\nPros.\\n\r\n1. Issei becomes more badass of course.\\n\\n\r\nCons.\\n\r\n1. Forced plot\\n\r\n2. Issei VS Vali postponed for next season\\n\r\n3. Unnecessary Issei almost dying 3 times even though he's the protagonist and obviously he'll never die.\\n\r\n4. Pheonix Sister adores Issei.\\n\r\n5. Plot holes, a shit load of them.\\n\\n\r\nIt has a lot of cons, but it's DxD, it can get away with it easily, knowing it... I kind of trashed it, but I won't lie, it's still an alright show, and I'll look forward to a fourth season, I want to see Issei and Vali fight in their strongest form or see them ally together and defeat the Red Dragon God thing.\\n\\n\r\nOne way this season would've been better if Issei left the group and joined the Chaos Brigade and got stronger, kind of like Tokyo Ghoul when Taneki left the coffee place.",

Surely they are \"bobs\", \"harem\", \"e\u0441chi\" etc. Indeed, this title is full of such things. But this is on the one hand. On the other hand, we see rather beautiful title with interesting plot and developed universe.\r\nWe are used to think that ecchi is all about stamps, but this title brings something new to ecchi genre and that's why I like it.\r\nSurely, pantsu, boobs and nose bleeding are everywhere (what ecchi will exist without it?) but we stillhave the characters. Yes, they're typical women from the typical harem, but there stories are not confused. Each of them has individuality (even men). Each of them likes main character for their own reason, not because he's nice.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about main character, we can remember such guys from lots of ecchies and harems, but this one is different. He is helpful in every situation, though his thoughts are all about boobs. He will do whatever he need to do(remember the first season when he went to customers by bike).\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I can say that this title is based on really good characters that not every ecchi and even not every modern anime has. The plot is interesting too though we've seen this lots of times. So the score is 7.6 ~ 8. You should see it to know the difference between the average ecchi(which is not good) and good ecchi(wich is really good).",

There was no actual development, it was more like Koneko's like thisright now and then suddenly she completely changes and everything is fine again.\\n\\n\r\nStory : 4\\n\r\nEasily the least interesting story out of all the series.

It is certain there are some positive points in it:\r\nThe story as always were the most valuable point, although not very loyal to the light novel, the anime series have acchived my expectations, it was a very funny, still serious season, 10/10. The sound was very good, I think the music and battle scenes were well balanced, not an epic song for a normal scene or a poor song for an epic battle, 8/10. The series was quite enjoyable, but not what wasexpected, 8/10.\\n\r\nAlthough those aspects received a good mark, the reason I gave it such a bad one (from my point of view, this mark could be considered appaling for such a masterpiece as DxD) were the following:\\n\r\nThe characters development were poor in the animation, but I could not give a mark in this just for bad decisions made by the studio, I had to consider the light novel's writer work as well, otherwise I would not be fair, 9/10. Now to the most disapointing: the art. Some people might not notice, but bugs and other things even worse were frequent during the whole series, mostly in the characters eyes, I would not be exagerating if I rated it horrible, 3/10.\\n\r\nI do not think you would see this series if you had not seen the prequels, so I would consider fair to watch it as a link from the second to the fourth season.\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nHope I helped.",

They think it's all DxD's got, but it's not.\r\nThis season has got much less ecchi than before.\r\nCharacters are advancing, and so is the plot.\r\nSure it has some generic anime cliches, but hell, Nisekoi is based around cliches, and it's still rated fairly well.\r\nIt's a very enjoyable anime that anyone with a bit of a tolerance for ecchi can watch. If you are weak to that kind of thing, give it a shot, if you don't like it, skip it. That's my rule when watching anime.Enjoy it, so you don't have to bloody flame the show.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it for it's light-heartedness and actually pretty decent relationships between characters. It's a funny show as well, so it has it's pluses.\\n\r\nI don't like a few things to be honest.\\n\r\nFirst off, I don't like that it's a bit too fast moving for my tastes, but that might be due to me watching Monogatari series.\\n\r\n2nd, some characters that are gonna have a role of one of the main heroines (yes, I'm talking about Rossweisse) doesn't get nearly enough screentime.\\n\r\nAnd last, but not least, I'm gonna have to wait till I'm like 30 till I can watch next season :l\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, a really enjoyable show, could be better, but I've had my fun.

            "content": "It's not funny.\r\nBorN suffers from the grave offense of what I call \"miscalculated escalation,\" which unfortunately is just as big a problem in TV as haphazard genre-shifting. In tl;dr fashion, it's the cinematic equivalent of premature ejaculation. Here, it's the rapid ramping up of Issei's power in a way that completely obliterates the ceiling of believability (relative to the fact this is an anime about fat cartoon tiddies).\r\nFirst Issei is just a guy who loves boobies; then, he has a sweet arm that can do magic and stuff; that turns into a time-limited set of armor, along the way adopting the power to blast offwomen's clothes; from there he evolves into a super mega ultra giga turbo overblast nukatron armageddon apocalyptic colossus red dragon of supreme ass kicking that can utterly (udderly?) obliterate absolutely anything in the universe no problem no question don't worry about it. Oh but there's still like four episodes or whatever left, so now he's back to the set of armor but has some devil lasers on his back or someshit.\\n\\n\r\nThere's just nothing left that is as cool as an unhinged death dragon stomping around annihilating all in its path. Everything that comes after is boring and underwhelming comparatively, which is even more lame than the Issei dub actor going to prison for kiddie porn. The new actor's crappy skills are so mild next to the issues BorN has that I totally forgot I hated him about ten minutes in.\\n\\n\r\nBorN also sheds 95% of the humor from the first two series to go hand-in-hand with lame boob jokes that feel forced rather than natural. I don't know if it's different writers or what, but the whole intangible feel of the show is off-center so much that the change of voice talent is a non-issue. Even the fan service panty shots and jello kazonga sound effects are tacked on like an afterthought, which reminded me of the R-rated DVD cut of Live Free or Die Hard and all the off-screen F-bombs that were lazily edited on. \\n\\n\r\nIt's just boring and dumb. Worth watching? Yeah maybe, but there's no soul anymore.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nJugs, bazoongas, melons; no matter what they are called, breasts are a universal constant. Boobs bear the \u201cnectar of life,\u201d cause men and women alike to turn heads, and are something that everyone can get behind. High School DxD BorN, returning for a third season, believes the same, providing busts of the large, small, round, supple, and bodacious variety. Mammaries are a wonderful part of the world, and it is lovely to see them in anime or anywhere, but the question remains: for this one, is it enough? Can its smorgasbord of boobies keep itself afloatfrom start to finish? Sadly, no, the anime sinks where its brethren swam.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nHigh School DxD is a series famous for its ability to balance both its plot-centric and \u201cecchi\u201d material. Many moments even see a combination of the two halves \u2013 such as Issei\u2019s \u201cBoosto\u201d ability \u2013 that demonstrate how well it capitalizes on the elements at its disposal. High School DxD BorN continues the tale, but chooses to deviate from its safe formula when it worries less about maintaining balance and more about dramatic events. Specifically, the lack of proper explanation, the exclusion of purposeful \u201cecchi\u201d content, and the halfhearted exploration of sympathy prevent the show from having strength, resulting in a weak narrative that tarnishes the series\u2019 reputation.\\n\\n\r\nBorN\u2019s (the shortening of choice) first fault comes from failing to detail a lot of the aspects that it introduces. Strangely, the anime hardly ever encountered such an issue before, simply because it prioritized world-building. One example is the idea of characters being chess pieces, which is logical once the show explained the underworld\u2019s tendency to solve issues through games of a similar nature. BorN opts for a more confusing approach where the show actively seeks to avoid giving the necessary context to understand newly incorporated aspects. For instance, the \u201cChaos Brigade\u201d is an opposing force throughout the season, but their goals, motivations, and identities are never made explicitly clear. Consequently, many of the plot points, like Loki\u2019s betrayal and Red Dragon\u2019s appearance, lose meaning since the details making them relevant are missing. The anime might have been trying to keep the focus on Rias and the other girls\u2019 assets, which makes sense; at its core, BorN wants nothing more than to present uncensored boobs. But when the narrative includes occurrences like the swift appearance and exit of villains or the notion that willpower wins the day without also including reason, the plot goes from looking like eye-candy to looking like trash.\\n\\n\r\nMore garbage is found within BorN\u2019s second fault: the \u201cecchi\u201d moments rarely have a semblance of purpose beyond their superficial appeal. \u201cRarely\u201d was chosen because there are select instances where the anime uses the risqu\u00e9 as a catalyst to drive the plot. One of the earliest examples of this is Issei\u2019s first meeting with Kuroka where, to grant himself power, Issei plays with Rias\u2019s nipple. Another happens much later in the series, in the form of telepathy through boobs, thereby earning Issei and his team the upper hand. Both are ridiculous, but rather than the \u201cecchi\u201d existing just to exist it instead allows for the show to progress in a manner that is fun, arousing, and purposeful. In contrast, Rias in a devil outfit or Xenovia throwing herself at Issei are no doubt designed to be sexy but forget to mean much to the overall goals of the show. Asia\u2019s kidnapping situation showcases the worst of this, where her mistreatment and nakedness are byproducts of the scenario rather than the scenario coming about because of the \u201cecchi\u201d material. It is difficult to feel sympathy for the anime at this point because both halves \u2013 the plot and the \u201cecchi\u201d elements \u2013 fail to be understandable and purposeful, respectively.\\n\\n\r\nCoincidentally, sympathy is one of the anime\u2019s only notable facets. Sympathy, not empathy, because Issei recognizes their hardships, as opposed to experiencing their emotions. It is a theme that is not immediately apparent, since it is hidden behind the shapely boobs and misshapen plot. Essentially, each arc in BorN focuses on a particular member of the harem, with Issei aiding each girl in overcoming her particular issue. He protects Koneko from her sister, he pushes Akeno from her past, he rescues Asia from her stalker, and he saves Rias from herself. His constant awareness of the people around him demonstrates to a degree the efficacy of sympathy when each girl, regardless of the predicament she is placed in, is helped through her troubles. Nothing grandiose \u2013 this is a common theme in many anime \u2013 but at the minimum Issei does not do it alone; in nearly all circumstances the remaining cast is present, fighting alongside the boy who has already done so much for them. Ironically, their feelings are cared for and not their bodies, which goes against the \u201cecchi\u201d material. Therefore, the anime undermines its own ideals, serving somewhat as an explanation for the deterioration of the sexual and the narrative elements.\\n\\n\r\nBorN might have many chests to stare at, but the problems with its plot, \u201cecchi\u201d material, and themes are distracting enough to ruin whatever sequences it managed to piece together.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nBorN\u2019s art style is neither distinct nor captivating. The show\u2019s locations are limited, with mostly Issei\u2019s mansion, the school proper, and reddish, craggy parts of the underworld visited. Near the end, the characters even enter an interdimensional vortex where the background becomes vomit. The anime does pay extra attention to its breasts, with shadows, contours, and depressions accentuating them as highly as possible for maximum attractiveness.\\n\\n\r\nAttractiveness continues when the character designs remain almost exactly the same (to be expected) for the third season. Rias\u2019s flowing red hair, Akeno\u2019s long, black ponytail, and Koneko\u2019s shortness of both stature and locks return, each sporting their signature school attire. Rossweisse, a newcomer, is clad in grey and silver to match her older \u201cChristmas Cake\u201d status. Other people, like Loki and Lucifer, look the part with their regal clothes and armor despite having a small role in the festivities. Overall, the designs remain strong even years after their original conception.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, strength cannot be found in the show\u2019s actual animation. Simply put, it is poor. Scenes rife with action \u2013 such as when Issei powers up or when large-scale battles break out \u2013 see the bare minimum of fluidity, with choppy hammer swings and lame choreography. Casual scenarios likewise see stunted animation, with little movement of even the most common of actions. The exception, once again, are the breasts that litter the anime; the boobs bounce and boing in their boisterous bountifulness.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nAlthough BorN has major issues in regards to its story and animation, a theme of transformation chains the cast members together, with a weak link threatening the tautness of the connection between them.\\n\\n\r\nThe formation of the chain begins early when Rias and her household decide to train themselves individually to improve their abilities. Issei works with a dragon master, Kiba develops his sword skills, and Koneko practices her punches, each vying to increase his or her capabilities. In other words, labor transforms the characters for the better. Transformation also occurs at the end when Rossweisse is invited to join the harem, but it is more a clever joke than an improvement of her person \u2013 she foregoes her Valhalla heritage to spite Odin\u2019s forgetting of her, but at this point she is \u201cjust another demon,\u201d meaning she will still be forgotten. Nevertheless, transformation establishes itself both at the beginning and the end of the season.\\n\\n\r\nThe start and the finish focus on transformation, and the same can be said of the middle. As was previously discussed, BorN contains roughly four arcs that each focus on a separate girl, namely: Koneko, Akeno, Asia, and Rias. For Koneko, besides learning more about her sibling, the audience discovers the origins of her power. Descending from a line of felines, she had always repressed her other half because she felt that accepting it would somehow cause her to become her twisted sister. But through Rias and Issei\u2019s sympathy, she comes to understand that change does not automatically bring hardship since one\u2019s friends and family will be there to support such a movement. Thus, Koneko transforms into the catlike person she had always been, and bringing with her a newfound sense of worth. Akeno also undergoes transformation, although it is mental rather than physical. Interestingly, the anime delves far into her past to show the death of her mother, the loneliness she experienced, and the hate she brewed for her father. Such hate was childish, though, since she did not fully comprehend the circumstances. Subsequently her present behavior towards her father was childish as well \u2013 ignoring him, pushing him away, and generally being rude to her only parent. But when she attempts to erase her past in an irrational manner, she looks deep inside herself to reach the rational conclusion that she was to blame for being alone, not her father. Therefore, while Akeno had always had the body of a woman, the reconciliation she went through allowed her mind to transform into a woman, too.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, the talk of transformation brings up a pressing question: why is Asia included on the list? After all, she has received a lot of focus during the prequels, most notably in the first season where she was reborn. Stranger still, she is sound of mind and pure of thought, with her knowing who she is, what she wants, and how she needs to act. In essence, Asia acts as a foil for the other girls since she does not need to transform, pronouncing to a higher degree the transformations that do take place. Comparing her difficulty to those of the other girls makes this more obvious; unlike Koneko, Akeno, and Rias, an outer influence attacks Asia rather than an inner struggle. So, while Asia is already a good and whole person, the counterintuitive angle taken expounds on this theme that much further.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Rias\u2019s obtuse transformation nearly rusts the chain. Throughout most of the season, Rias was what could only be described as jealous. Issei worrying for and helping out each girl other than Rias was not sitting comfortably with the president, with each new event slowly expanding the evil resting in her bosom. As the season heads towards the finale, she explodes, literally transforming from a motherly and kind leader into a despondent and angered villain. Donning dragon armor like Issei, all seems lost as she refuses (willingly or not) to come back to her senses. Issei eventually calls out to her, saving Rias from spelling her own doom, but the anime chooses to imply that she still holds these same feelings, just not to the extent that they once were. A devil\u2019s advocate would point out that this is another angle of transformation, that there are certain people who cannot transform as quickly and as easily as Koneko and Akeno did. Given that this is true, Rias\u2019s development throughout the season holds up well, but since the show chooses to have Issei conveniently forget the climax of her arc, it leaves the impression that Rias\u2019s feelings are not as important as they obviously should be.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme tries to be extravagant, both in voice and in instrument. But it is too much for the piece, with it collapsing upon itself due to the sporadic English words and all-over-the-place tone. The ending theme, in contrast, manages to be both fun and catchy, with the chorus, vocalist, and beat unifying to create a song that mirrors the happiness that can often be found in the series.\\n\\n\r\nHappy times are also found when the soundtrack is heard. Many of the tracks adopt weird sound effects, such as in \u201cShikou no Yuuwaku,\u201d that are designed to be silly so that they coincide with the slice-of-life moments. Other tracks, like \u201cOmoi.Sorezore,\u201d take into account the foreboding nature of the season, providing haunting arrangements that weigh on one\u2019s conscious. Others still, such as \u201cShouri,\u201d are quick and orchestral, pumping one\u2019s adrenaline to new heights. Perhaps the \u201cbest\u201d track of the bunch is \u201cOppai Dragon no Uta,\u201d with Issei chanting his love of dragons and boobs, amusing all who listen. As a small aside, the squishing sounds of the breasts as they move is a detail not needed but much appreciated. Thus, the OST spans a wide range of genres that fit the anime nicely, making it an all-around positive offering.\\n\\n\r\nA bit on the negative side, the voice acting for BorN is somewhere around average. While the show has everyone return to reprise their roles, there are neither exceptional nor appalling performances to speak of. However, a special shout-out is deserved for Yuuki Kaji as Issei for his screaming and pervert-esque voice.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nI like Rias, and I like Akeno. I also like Asia, Xenovia, Koneko, Issei, and everyone else that the series has on the table. But this one was just not entertaining for me. The drama was lacking intensity, the comedy was not funny, and the amount of non-brooding Rias was disappointing. One of the worst offenses was the ED\u2019s visuals; the third ending theme did away with the sexy dancing that the first two championed, a decision that is nothing short of blasphemy. If anything, the uncensored boobs made the ride tolerable, but were definitely not enough to erase the troubles I had with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nHigh School DxD BorN brings the breasts, yet simultaneously goes against \u201cthree times the charm.\u201d Its mangled narrative, less-than-stellar art, and low value \u2013 in terms of emotion and laughter \u2013 are a bit too much to bear. While the characters are executed nicely and the soundtrack hits many notes, those aspects alone cannot prop this one up. Born it may be but beautiful it be not.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, not enough details surrounding the world, the \u201cecchi\u201d rarely has purpose, and the theme on sympathy is simultaneously consistent and undermining\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, boring art style, nice character designs, below average actual animation, with special care given to all of the breasts\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, a theme of transformation forms a chain between Koneko, Akeno, Asia, and Rias, with the latter rusting it slightly\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, bad OP, good ED, good soundtrack, about average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, pales in comparison to the first two seasons\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

            "content": "First off I want to say that I have never read any of the novel so this is an anime only review.\r\nHigh School DxD is one of those anime that I really want to love. When done correctly it can be funny, exciting and very very echii. I have all previous seasons and always end up rather disappointed. This new season though started out great but then suddenly went off the rails. \r\nSTORY: I've personally found the story in every season to be all over the place. This season started out different though. I really enjoyed the first half as it had moments of bigcrazy fights, shocking twists and some character development for several of the cast. I can't go into details but I can honestly say the first half of this season is really a joy to watch. If you come for just the echii moments, they are there but they weren't exaggerated. I think even the Issei has become used to walking around with every girl around him naked. He is still perverted though bless his heart. Some of the funnier moments come when he tries to fulfill his oppai fantasies, and all for a good reason. The second half, especially the final arc was a different story though. The story arcs lost any impact whatsoever. They managed to survive certain moments due to plain out miracles, or plot armor would be a better description. I really appreciate when an anime goes beyond belief and is brave enough to do something shocking. Very few do however, and those that do immediately eliminate it. Looking at you ALdnoah Zero. Anyways, my point is I would have enjoyed the final arcs more if they could keep any sense of danger, however everyone is miraculously fine. \\n\r\nAs I said I've never read any of the novelsbut I do keep an eye on comments. I did notice that while readers did have complaints with the first half, they were essentially fine with it because it was still entertaining. When I noticed myself getting bored and annoyed at the second half I went back and found every reader to be angry and upset at how the story was jumping around. That made everything make sense as to why the end felt like a big mess. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is good, not much to say really. The character designs are well done, The fighting scenes are exciting and the echi...well they know what they are doing. Nothing too overly impressive. I'm sure if you look at every scene frame by frame you could find problems but who does that? \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\n  Lets start with the King herself....king piece...president Rias. I love Rias, I wish she could be better presented. I feel there is so much more to her than what we see. She's the type of person you'd be willing to devote your entire life serving at her side. That plus I like redheads....anyways....\\n\r\nThe one that stole the spotlight this season by far I feel was Koneko. We got to see more of her past, how she came to meet Rias. Plus she is just plain adorable at moments, while a badass at other moments. \\n\r\nAsia I'm going to admit I don't really like. She is the little sister of the group and that is fine, I simply find her too dull. It's no coincidence her role was bigger at the second half of the season. Plus she is sooo lucky. \\n\r\nThe rest didn't really have much to do this season. Akeno had a small personal arc that went nowhere. \\n\r\nRossweiss, though not enough screen time, was fun to watch and I am interested in seeing her in the future. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the fumble at the end, there were some enjoyable and memorable moments this season. You'll end the season thinking, \"that was it?\" There were good fights, funny moments, cute moments and the song oppai dragon automatically adds another point alone. So it was good, a step above decent. Would I suggest it to friends? Only if they are looking for something echii. If they care more about story though, I'd suggest something else",

You know the typical males in ecchi anime are usually weak, never execute, and act like they are allergic to women that approach them sexually. That doesn't exist here.\r\nIf the reasons outlined above don't already have you wanting to watch this, there is zerohope for you to ever get into the ecchi genre. Truly.\\n\\n\r\nOh and as a small tip, if you have the option available to you, do yourself a favor and watch the uncensored version of this anime. I never saw the censored TV version, but I just don't see how it's possible to grasp a major part of this anime with censoring.",

Bonus if made into a anime movie or a live action movie.\r\nSeason 4 is already probably in many HS DXD fans minds like me since episode 8 or 9 or better episode 1.\r\nLooking foward to SEASON 4\r\nMany unanswered questions and revelations...... So season 4 is a must must happen no matter what.......\r\n1. We all know now DXD means Dragons Of Dragons. That answered part of it.\r\n2. Brewing romance of casts\r\n- Gasper & Koneko (coming of age sort of well his age is thousand years same goes with Koneko)..... who's older youdecide, bottomline, they are a match.\\n\r\n- Yuuto & Tsubaki, hottest guy in school and the other hottest girl (outside Rias herself & Akeno).\\n\r\n- Souua & Saji (same like Issei & Rias)\\n\r\n- Xenovia & Asia, lesbian anyone....\\n\r\n- Possible linkage Katase or Murayama to Motohama or Matsuda.\\n\\n\r\n3. The usual love triangles (who is the lover and who are the mistresses)\\n\r\n- Rias Issei Akeno\\n\r\nwell all the girls have a a romance towards Issei so 3, 4, 5 way.....\\n\\n\r\n4. The postponed duel of Issei & Vali.\\n\r\n5. Loki's revenge..... to think a prison can hold him for all eternity.\\n\r\n6. When where how will the Kaos Brigaide's next attack.......\\n\r\n7. Will Akeno finally reconcille with her father?\\n\r\n8. Will Rossweisse find her first love? I guess its Azazel..... they're both teachers / adults.\\n\r\n9. Will Koneko/Shirone turn her evil older sister Kuroka back to the good side?\\n\r\n10. Will Rias finally have a baby & Issei is the father?\\n\r\n11. Will the Red Dragon reveal his motives?\\n\r\n12. And will Issei finally have his Harem & be a Harem King? (although I think he already have it, he just make it a silly erotic perverted dream).\\n\\n\r\nQuite simillar to Seikon no Qwaser, breasts energized the hero. In Qwaser squeezing, fondling, flapping, licking, sucking breastmilk gives energy to the hero while DXD is all but no breastmilk. A cut through to hentai mode. Almost.\\n\\n\r\nToo bad there are no hentai versions of both animes, except Princess Lover. If there will be one..... I know it will be packed.",

            "content": "Umm...let me be honest here. I started watching High School DxD series because of the things it was good at: adequately mixing its overt fan-service with little bit of plot and good comedy. For me, if an anime is completely made of fan-service, it is not usually worth investing one's time. However, High School DxD is different in that it cleverly uses fan-service, not as a gratuitous method to attract viewers, but as an integral part of the entire story, which fits seamlessly in the big flow of things. Also, the comedy involving fan-service is a giant plus in watching this show.\r\nBut this third seasonHigh School DxD BorN sadly decided to cut down its use of its forte: the harmonious blend of boobs+comedy+the general flow of things. Instead it decides to focus more on the complex affairs of politics in the world of devils, dragons, Nordic gods, etc --- making the show feeling rather heavy and somber overall. So, in this season, we rarely see Issei and friends in the  real world and school life, but in other dimensions fighting gods and dragons.\\n\r\nI know, we can't always have school life and fan-service, because the affairs of the underworld and fighting gods is what differentiates this show from others. Otherwise, High School DxD would be just one of those slice of life harem fan service shows that are too common out there.\\n\r\nHowever, like I said earlier, I got into this series because of the good use of fan service+comedy and the warm and often light-hearted atmosphere. Here, I really misses the old times. I haven't read the original source material, but it was rather tiring to watch characters fighting and raging episode after episode. I gladly welcome those political stories for the sake of the plot, but too much of it might make High School DxD lose its identity.\\n\r\nI think - like Issei - many viewers crave some Oppai when they are watching High School DxD. I am not saying the show was bad, but it was just too repetitively gloomy and heavy at times.\\n\r\nNot everyone might agree, but that is my frank opinion of this third season.",

            "content": "I am probably going to get hate for this, but I watched the dubbed version of this series. It was a very good series. It has a good mixture of comedy and action. The main character's lust for boobs is what gives him all his power. Issei reaches a powerful form just because he poked his master's breasts. Plus, Koneko has some funny one liners in the show. The amount of breasts shown in this series is outrageous. In one episode I counted 35 pairs of breasts in one episode. Issei is usually put into awkward situations when breasts are out because the other girlsattack him. It usually ends up with him getting interrupted and leaving a laugh. For example, he gets attacked by girls while he is putting something in a shed. It ends up with him getting caught by an angel while he has his hands on some boobs. All the angel said was that they shouldn't be doing that in the shed because it is filthy.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the action is very good. Issei's heart in every battle is something special. He doesn't care about anything other than protecting his friends. The character is full of heart and does everything with such passion. When losing a friend he becomes full of hate and rage that he actually loses control and reaches such a powerful form that it almost kills him. The main character is a fool, along with a respectable person.\\n\\n\r\nGood show.",

High School DxD BorN is the third season of High School DxD, a franchise that has securely found it\u2019s place in otaku culture. If you do not know the story by now this is not the review for you. \r\nStory\r\nFollowing the events of season 2, Issei and company travel to the underworld to compete in a tournament between promising young devils. This tournament is what has become a staple ofthe franchise, a rating game. A rating game is an opportunity for devils to gain esteem and fame in the underworld as well as to gain ranks in the devil hierarchy. However events do not go as planned, the Gremory family get involved and as usual have to save the day.\\n\\n\r\n Besides the fanservice what I find the most interesting about the franchise is the mechanics of the underworld and the hierarchy that exists. There is surprisingly a large amount of detail and depth put into the rankings, the families, strategy all of which can be pretty overwhelming. What bothered me this season was that there was little to no mention of these mechanics because the tournament that was supposed to happen, never really happens but instead gets rudely interrupted. \\n\\n\r\n This season introduces Norse Mythology to the series. Recently I have been watching a tv show called Vikings on History and have become infatuated with all things Norse. I was happy to see how certain plot elements were taken from Norse mythology, albeit with an anime twist. Who knows, you might learn something. Head count, we now have Devils, Angels, Fallen Angels, norse gods and... cat girls? Yes I said it, nyaa! \\n\\n\\n\r\n Characters\\n\\n\r\nThis season in particular puts particular emphasis on the other females in Issei\u2019s harem, Koneko, Akeno and Asia. Of the three I felt that Koneko\u2019s was more interesting because it introduced backstory to the character similar to Kiba in season 2. Speaking of which I always wondered how Kiba feels about having every female member of his family fawning over Issei. There are hints of a possible love interest for Kiba, so have fun looking for it because it only lasts a second. Koneko attitude towards Issei somewhat takes a complete 180, instead of acting tsundere Koneko now wears her feelings on her sleeve for him. Looking back I still do not feel that this was not deserved and only served to satisfy a certain anthropomorphic trope. \\n\\n\r\n Many new characters are introduced to the show adding to the intrigue. One character that I didn\u2019t understand why was even introduced was a valkyrie called Rossweisee. Rossweisee serves Odin, is incredibly beautiful and constantly complains about not having a boyfriend. She has no purpose to the story and as of yet has no relationship to Issei. \\n\\n\r\n Issei this season is his usual overpowered, oppai loving self. What I found interesting early on was Issei recollection of a certain painful event that occurred during the first episode of the franchise. It answers the question as to why Issei doesn\u2019t choose one girl, perhaps why his relationship with Rias never goes anywhere further. The conclusion of the season addresses this plot point, Issei recognizes this fault, however Rias and the other girls of the harem seem to have no idea so it is never fully resolved.\\n\\n\\n\r\n Animation and Sound\\n\\n\r\nDespite being a show filled with demons and fallen angels, Highschool DxD always finds a way to visually pop off the screen with it\u2019s contrasting color palette and art style. There is a noticeable lack of quality this season as compared to season 2. This is typical of a series in it\u2019s 3rd season and is to be expected. It\u2019s not a deal breaker so long as you keep your expectations low.\\n\r\nThe music this season is largely a disappointment. The words forgettable, boring, typical comes to mind. I found myself constantly skipping the opening and ending. Nothing this season particularly stands to mind.\\n\\n\\n\r\n Final Verdict\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nArt: 5/10\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nFanservice: infinity /10\\n\r\nEnjoyment:7.5/10\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOf the three seasons so far, High School DxD BorN is by far the weakest. However I was able to watch the entire series in 1 weekend, therefore I still enjoyed the show despite it\u2019s faults. If you have seen the first 2 seasons, I would say you should watch BorN but with the caveat of keeping your expectations low. The fanservice and comedy is abundant, yet the plot especially towards to end of the series drags. The plot drags to such a degree that much of the drama introduced never gets fully resolved. The whole season feels as though it\u2019s filler or set up for possible future seasons.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final note, I first started watching this season when it was first airing and stopped due to all the censors (for obvious reasons). It has been less than 2 months since the series stopped airing and I was able to watch the entire season uncensored. Don\u2019t worry, I didn\u2019t faint from loss of blood due to excess nosebleeds.",

I'll go as far to say that many reviews that are low scored here were written without watching the anime and with the sole purpose to drag down shows they don't like as many of them seem to be have been written with their feet.\r\nSTORY:\r\nDxD continues with the now third season of Born were the Light Novel is closely followed into the settlement that comes after the three factions Angels, Fallens andDemons are trying to set up camp and discuss further matter of the New Faction that seeks to destroy relations between the humans and the joined supernatural.\\n\\n\r\nSome chapters were switched as many Light Novel readers are aware of and Icchei Ishibumi along with TNK decided to throw us the fans a twist, More of a foreshadowing for those who have yet to read Volume 20.\\n\\n\r\nThe arc here presents Loki and The Infinite Dragon God meddling with the three factions and wether there was some tweaking to a fourth season it's on the air. \\n\\n\r\nDid it work?, Absolutely but i must warned you if you're a Light Novel reader you might be slightly pissed off towards the end as you can't no longer predict what will happen next as new things are thrown our way.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nI have no complains, The art was astounding and easy to take in.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe Intro and ED theme are astounding, The voice actors on Japanese are on their A Game and the OST are on point. For the Dubbing however we lost the voice actors for Issei and Akeno. The new actor for Issei it's alright you can hear he tries and the acting is by no means mediocre, Akeno on the other hand it's a bit off.\\n\\n\r\nShe sounds too nice and you can't feel the sadism the previous one portrayed so well. The rest of the cast are back.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nFurther elaboration is all i have to say, We learn about Akenos past and this somewhat breaks the image we all had of her and we see her soft side. Many  characters go in depth so he action varies and the ecchi scenes are maintained but since Akeno is down for the count due to emotional reasons since the person she despise showed up the level we all enjoy of teasing Akeno dishes out is reduced.\\n\\n\r\nA new character makes a debut and she it's from the North Myth to the Occult Club.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis season was enjoyable and with subjective perspective wether what you anticipated being changed sat well with you or not. DxD continues to be the top Ecchi anime in existence.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThe third season was amazing however the chances of people that don't read the light novel enjoying it further than those who do it's about 70%, No fan base likes having the material they now so well be discarded for a change after all.",

            "content": "As I predicted in my preview review, here we have the third installment of this almost-hentai series. Though I have no idea what the \"Born\" in the title actually means (season 2 was \"New\" so maybe new-born?), it's a good continuation of what we've seen so far from the franchise and its ever-increasing scope and ever-growing harem.\r\nSo now that the angels, fallen angels, and demons have supposedly set aside their differences, we now learn that this is only a small fraction of all spiritual/non-human beings. This season introduces Norse-based entities including Valkyrie and Thunder-wielding gods. How will this new faction affect the new and fragilealliance? Will we have an all-out melee?\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe animation style hasn't changed much from the second season, the coloring is pretty much identical and you still get more action and ecchi for your time than most other shows. The setting does change a bit though, whereas the original was rooted mostly in the Earth realm, the majority of this season takes place in demon world, and you get to see the Gremory estate for the first time. As for characters, the show brings in a lot of new characters while still giving some cameos to the supporting cast of previous seasons.\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned, expect plenty of action in this show. Issei takes his dragon armor to new heights and you'll see plenty of fighting be it with melee or magical attacks. There's a fair amount of blood as well, not really a departure from previous iterations of the show. As for ecchi, I've forgotten how high the ecchi level is in this show, I was quickly reminded with the almost constant topless nudity. This is definitely not a show to bring to work. Expect all sorts of ecchi ranging from blatant seduction to fondling. I mean come on, the main protagonist powers up by poking his master's breasts.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThough not quite as good as the original OP, the third OP is a definite improvement from the previous seasons. It's a fast paced piece that is fitting for the action-based show, with a decent main melody too. The ED is a fun, playful piece that works well for the ecchi aspect of the show. The BGM is supportive and pretty wide ranged, from playful instrumentals to heavily string-based fight tunes. There are a few familiar melodies carried over from previous seasons.\\n\\n\r\nThe veteran VA cast is carried over from the previous seasons and they deliver as expected. There are possibly more moaning and ecchi-based utterances than even some hentai works. I still find Ayana Taketatsu's role as Koneko interesting as her usual roles are a lot more boisterous. Expect the original harem members (Youko Hikasa, Azumi Asakura, Shizuka Itou, and Ayana Taketatsu) to receive the most screen time.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThere really is only a single main plot that spans the entirety of the season, with multiple mini subplots to thicken the brew. Basically, the group migrates to the demon world to receive training. While they're there, the entire Norse mythology thing is introduced and stuff starts going awry. Overall, the season is pretty entertaining, with a lot of cliffhangers and interesting twists. The show does build to a fitting climax and resolution, but still leaves a lot of open questions no doubt to be explored in future works. The actual climax is also not as well developed as that in the previous season, it somehow feels more like an afterthought.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a bit more of a focus on Koneko and her past in the first half of the season, while the second half sheds a bit more light on the whole dragons theme. As with previous seasons, expect to hear \"boost\" a great deal. Despite his ever-boosted power, Issei does feel a lot weaker than I remember him being- expect him to be beaten up a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThough the story was still entertaining, it didn't contribute nearly as much to the overall world as I would have expected. Rather than exploring existing open questions like what are the goals and motivations of the Chaos Brigade's members the show attempts to distract you with even more girls and oh look there's Thor's hammer. I guess I shouldn't expect so much given the amount of budget that probably went into drawing bouncy breasts.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nMy sentiments for this category echo what I said in the second season. There's definitely less character development than I'd like; I was also pretty wrong in my belief that the \"new\" girls from the second season would play a significant role here. Though Issei does get a ton of skinship with the harem members, the new girls of this season and season two don't get as much development as they deserve. I actually feel obliged to quote my last review: \"If there's anything to complain about, it's that some of the new characters feel kind of thrown in artificially as if it were a last minute decision to include them; they feel completely underutilized and underdeveloped.\" They totally did not fix this issue in this season.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're just in it to see cute girls in softcore porn then I guess none of the above really matters.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nDxD strikes an interesting balance between the action of a shonen show and the lustful appeal of a hentai piece. A lot of times, hybrids of the sort don't really work; this is one of those nice exceptions in which it does. While the show isn't going to win any prizes for depth of plot or characters, the raw entertainment value is pretty good. This latest iteration is a brainless but entertaining way to kill some time and reconnect with an interesting cast. It's not as strong as the last season but still recommended for those who enjoyed previous seasons.",

Surely they are \"bobs\", \"harem\", \"e\u0441chi\" etc. Indeed, this title is full of such things. But this is on the one hand. On the other hand, we see rather beautiful title with interesting plot and developed universe.\r\nWe are used to think that ecchi is all about stamps, but this title brings something new to ecchi genre and that's why I like it.\r\nSurely, pantsu, boobs and nose bleeding are everywhere (what ecchi will exist without it?) but we stillhave the characters. Yes, they're typical women from the typical harem, but there stories are not confused. Each of them has individuality (even men). Each of them likes main character for their own reason, not because he's nice.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking about main character, we can remember such guys from lots of ecchies and harems, but this one is different. He is helpful in every situation, though his thoughts are all about boobs. He will do whatever he need to do(remember the first season when he went to customers by bike).\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I can say that this title is based on really good characters that not every ecchi and even not every modern anime has. The plot is interesting too though we've seen this lots of times. So the score is 7.6 ~ 8. You should see it to know the difference between the average ecchi(which is not good) and good ecchi(wich is really good).",

            "content": "The harem king Issei is yet pursuing his dreams to obtain all the girls he wants, but the odds stack up against him like dead meat. Sounds like every sequel ever, a lot of twists have been revealed, and secrets finally unraveled, but does it still hold up against the previous season? specifically, against the magnificent second season?!\r\n- Story (7.2/10):\r\nUnlike the first season, that was a pile of fanservice with minimal story progression that gave more focus to nudity and neglected the story, and the second season that had a great sense of plot and development and considerable amount of fanservice, High School DxD BorNwas just a mess that didn't know what to focus on.\\n\r\nDon't get scared, the fanservice in here is still consistent, and highly present to the extent of ruining some great emotional or serious moments, but also, there was so much content compressed into a mere 12 episodes which made the story very fast paced and rushed that so many details were left out or unexplored enough to make any sense out of them. Throughout this season, the plot became very repetitive and highly predictable, while it expanded on other characters, it was just the same thing, character X with sad backstory gets threatened and kidnapped, let's go fellas for the rescue, over and over again.\\n\\n\r\n- Art (8.1/10):\\n\r\nThis one was slightly better than the previous seasons, considering how successful they were to provide a better budget, and it was well invested looking back at this season. It looks like the explored universe has gone some amped up physics that only seem to work on the chest areas the most.\\n\r\nThe transformation sequences were just beautiful, a sight worthy of seeing over and over again.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound (8.0/10):\\n\r\nI'm just fine with the soundtrack as it is, fabulous notes that fill you with immersive and excitement for what's going, talking specifically about the sadistic violin tone that plays on those warm moments of generous fanservice. the same applies to every other piece of music.\\n\r\nThis season had only one opening theme song, which is a blast looking on how I was opposed to the idea of having more than one opening theme song, it was great and catchy, differently better than the past season's second opening. I'd rank it as the third going by this order;\\n\r\nSeason 1 opening > Season 2 opening 1 > Season 3 opening > Season 2 opening 2.\\n\r\nThe ending song was great too with a huge potential for replayability.\\n\r\nThe voice acting I think was great, having to see Issei screaming and shouting in rampaging moments felt intense.\\n\\n\r\n- Character (8.0/10):\\n\r\nI don't hate any character, but Asia still has some problems she needs to address.\\n\r\nAl of your favorite characters make an appearance here plus new fine ones, just like the previous season that focused on Kiba and a bit on Akeno, this one was heavily around Koneko's mysterious past and Akeno's ordeal with making it up with her father, but nothing as intense as Kiba went through in my opinion, he is still to this day, the most developed character in the series in my eyes.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment (7.6/10):\\n\r\nI would say that I did enjoy this, but not as much as I was expecting, it was differently better than the first season, but very low on quality compared to the second season. there were those moments that make you hard on action burning with fire seeing those transformations and punches exchange, but some other time, I was just like, why? it doesn't make sense.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall (7.8/10):\\n\r\nIf you have already made it through the first two seasons, why not watch the third? in my opinion, it's not as good as the build-up at the end of the second season was leading to, but it did have a lot of stuff to show, like new characters, backstories, and more...\\n\r\nDon't worry, they have got you covered with the fanservice.",

            "content": "My opinion of season 3 does not differ much from season 1 & 2, so I've used my review for season 1 below. There is one large difference though. Season 2 made a mistake of introducing a hyper-sexualized child as a character. In my opinion, this character archetype needs to be eradicated from anime. That is only my opinion. Because of this, the cast of characters as a whole has lost a little value for me, but the anime is still outstanding!\r\nHigh School DXD is an ecchi/harem icon. If you are a fan of good storytelling punctuated with fanservice then DXD is for you. Someopinions fault DXD for being non-canonical with the manga or have too little story. The ecchi/harlem tag can definitely create this illusion of a lack of storytelling, and sometimes critics are correct. However, DXD does an extremely good job at finding the right combination of content and fanservice making DXD very special. DXD found a way to advance its story in every episode instead of using filler episodes like most ecchis. It's also important to remember that an anime is an anime, and not a manga. Seperate animals should be treated and designed a bit differently. In this way, some deviation from the manga is permissible and understandable as coming too close to the manga could lead The animated version into pitfalls. All in all, DXD is a must watch.\\n",

Very Popular-Ecchi-Romance-Supernatural-Action-Highschool Anime.\r\nNow,\r\nTalking about the review\r\nStory-6(BAD{based on my opinion though})\r\nHighschool Dxd has a regular ecchi-romance-highschool anime type stroy which most of the people like. It has a mix of normal life expanding to living with a bunch of beautiful girl and sleeping with them. It has the main plot of a boy being a devil who wants to become a harem king(though he has a harem already) and has the power of the 'Red Dragon Emperor'. And well, that concludes it!\r\nArt-9\r\nDespite the stroy, the serieshas a fantastic art/graphic quality. The art is stunning whether it comes to detailing boobs or magical battles(mostly the first part). Art might have deserved 10 only if the Balance breaker did not look that bad(I mean not as good as season 1). \\n\\n\r\nSound-10\\n\r\nThe op and ending are amazing, as well as the voice of the actors. The sound shows it magic as it  is very crucial to the anime. The sound when Issei touches a girl's breast as well as the sound that is produced during the battle. Absolutely Amazing.\\n\\n\r\nNow moving on,\\n\r\nCharacter-6.5-7\\n\r\nI really liked the characters but in some places I felt some kind of over reaction. Well it is to be expected in anime but I felt just 'that'.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-6.5\\n\r\nThe story, art, sound, aree good but I didn't enjoyed this show like some other people have. Mainly might be the reason that I am not a fan of harem, but still it was not bad. I really like to see mythology in anime, and  fanservice was there too. So if you are a fan of harem then youg might want to watch this season(like, who wouldn't?).\\n\\n\r\nSO that concludes all the points.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-5.75\\n\r\nA must watch for a fan of \\n\r\nGreat Art-Stunning Music-Oppai-Ecchi-Harem-Great Plot/Story-Hot Ladies-Romance-Supernatural-Highschool.\\n\r\nHave Fun Watching..",

The art, while it may be considered a cookie-cutter style, is an excellent sample of that stylenonetheless.  And there's just the right mix of ecchi and story to satisfy those seeking both quite well.\\n\\n\r\nThis particular season does progress a little rapidly compared to the first two seasons, starting and resolving some sub-plots a little too quickly, but otherwise a thoroughly entertaining way to pass a few hours.\\n\\n\r\nHigh opera it ain't, but it IS high ecchi.",

            "content": "After watching all three seasons(4th one coming out this year), I feel like I can give my own thoughts on this franchise. First of all, I would like to say that I did give this anime a 10/10 rating on my profile, but that was just a joke. I think this anime is an overall 8/10. And wroth the watch for some.\r\n       First lets talk about this anime being a Ecchi since thats what turns people away from Highschool DXD the most. This isn't the first harem anime I have watched inthe genre of Ecchi, and it sure wasn't the most well done. Althought showing anime tites is importent for this perverted main character to build his charater, somethimes this anime just doesn't know where to stop. There are scenes that are hard to take serious because of the nudity. However, in the long run they don't really take away from the charaters. With that being said, this franchise would not be what it is with out the nudity, which is why you have to look past the poor taste at times.\\n\r\n       As a harem, this anime does a great job of making all the female charaters likeable. Sure, you will most likey have a favorite one anyways, but it doesn't stop you from caring for the rest. Most people watch harem to escape from the more serious romace animes, or to simply take a break from the emotions, and this anime does a great job of that. The enjoyment of watching this without too much emotional attachments is 10/10. But if you want to take the charaters seriously, you could.\\n\r\n       How is this story? High School DxD does a great job of combining the harem parts with the action. Besides the casual tites poping out from the ripped clothes. The animation of the fighting scenes and the idea behind them is well done. Most of it was very enjoyable with the fact that a reasonable cause was behind all the fighting. \\n\r\n       Overall, this was a highly enjoyable show for me. I understand the people that can't seem to enjoy this franchise. After all, watching anime girls fight and sleep with there tits out isn't the most comfortable thing for most people. But if you have not on your list to watch and want something that does  Action, Comedy, Ecchi, Harem and Fantasy fairly well, this wouldn't be a bad choice. This sure isn't something you would show to a friend who doesn't watch anime. But I don't think that will stop people from enjoying it. If you haven't seen the last 2 seasons, give those a go. If you have seen the last 2 seasons. High School DxD Born definitely doesn't fall behind.",

            "content": "\"The Breasts of a woman have endless possibilities!\" - Azazel-sensei.\r\nHighschool DxD isn't for everyone, I'll admit that, but is a good anime nonetheless. This season really was different from the other two, things really got crazy 'till the end, even so I've found it pretty damn enjoyable. THIS IS A CASUAL REVIEW!\r\n- Story: 9/10 - Now let's be honest, for a harem/ecchi anime, the story is good... until season 3 came out I haven't noticed any plot holes, the whole demons - angels - fallen angels war was decent explained. \r\n- Characters 10/10 - Pretty much the ordinary cast of a harem anime. Rias isthe big sister No. 1 (also the best girl... just sayin'). She doesn't approve Issei lovin' other girls (that is really somethin' new... you know, in harem anime, the girls usually get along. Even help each other tryin' to seduce the MC. Rias - president, doesn't do it a all... she wants Issei only for herself). Pres. is that strong and dignified woman, but she is ready to trow everything away for her cute servant. - We haven't lost yet! You lose when you've given up\\n\r\nAkeno, big sister No.2 - A sadist fallen angel with a sad past... nothin' could have been better. She starts from the point where she can't stand her true nature and in Born she finally understands that it isn't his father fault...\\n\r\n\"Even the phoenix that rises from the ashes can't recover instantly from mental damage\"\\n\r\nIssei - one of the few harem MC-s that are actually pretty awesome... durin' the entire series he never lies about his desires, he never tries to hide the fact he is a perv addictet to ero and with a demonic desire to suck President's oppai.\\n\r\n\"I'm not going to be discouraged by fate.\" \\n\\n\r\n- Art 8/10 - I've not seen any remarcable improvement from previous seasons... the art looks great at close frames but when the characters are painted from a far away view they look shitty...\\n\\n\r\n- Sound... the opening of the first season was the best... this one is almost like that one, also the background music is ok... 10/10\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment - Damn, this was fucking hilarious... I was laughtin' my ass off most of the time... then I almost started to cry... then laught again... 10/10\\n\\n\r\n- Overall - I'll say Higschool DxD is as good as Grisaia no Kajitsu in terms of songs, art, story... but it was a lot mor enjoyable than Grisaia who made me cry...\\n\\n\r\nIf you've read everything then I congratulate you... I'm not a critic so I give 10 to everything that made me feel great... sorry if I disturbed you with my casual review.\\n",

I started watching the anime considering it was a light-hearted ecchi. But this season completely changes things.\r\nHighschool DxD BorN is a great anime, truly. It's too emotional on too many levels. Issei has grown a lot more powerful. By the end of the anime, and it's completely a personal opinion, Rias becomes far more lovable than she ever was.\r\nBorN has really great character relationships. The battle scenes are interesting. Quite indirectly, a lot of other species are showninvolved in this whole drama.\\n\\n\r\nBorN is the third season and it's more than just a continuation of the first two seasons. BorN is a complete anime altogether but you'll need to watch the first two to get a grip of things.\\n\\n\r\nSome heart-wrenching things happen in the concluding episodes related to Rias and that makes the entire experience of watching this anime series worthwhile. It's a payback season. I won't spoil it for you, you have to experience it yourself. It was so powerful that I couldn't stop listening to the soundtrack, watching the last episode again and again, and waiting for the fourth season after finishing it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd oh!

My friends have been telling me to watch this a few years back, and I finally did. High School DxD was fantastic, the story was good, and character development was balanced. High School DxD New was alright, as it has a fair amount of development for all characters.\r\nHowever, High School DxD BorN should just be renamed as High School DxD Asia. The wholedamn season was literally dedicated to Asia. Heck, I believe her screen time far surpasses every other character by a large margin.\\n\\n\r\nThis direction has left a foul aftertaste in my mouth after watching this. I've read that a season 4 is confirmed. If it continues to give full attention to Asia, I'm just going to drop the entire franchise and give it a rating of 1.

            "content": "*HEAVY SPOILERS*\r\nThis anime...boy where do i start. It's a brilliant anime, and i love it. But this specific season was bland. I wanna give this a better score, but i feel like it isn't justified, as the other two seasons we're far better. But aside from that you have Issei returning one last time to complete his Harem with some new faces. Now the reason i'm only giving a 7 for the story is mainly because the last few episodes were a \"repeat\" for me...giving that same \"Oh no, Asia\"....and then \"Oh, no Issei\"...and finally  \"Oh no, RIAS!\"...all three of the main characters inone season were all in peril for almost the same reasons, Asia & Rias both got kidnapped, and then Issei, trying to save both of them almost dies from the \"Juggernaut Drive\" powers he has. If they hadn't done that for the last few episodes, i would have EASILY given this story line a 10/10. Other than that, the story is well, great.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt in this anime isn't a problem, i LOVE this style of anime. Not much else to say but everything is just so beautiful in this anime and i love all of the effects and all the variety of detail to everything.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound for all of this anime, and not just this season alone, is pretty great. I love the \"Boost\" sound that the RDE states as Issei is boosting. Other than that the OP get's stuck in your head, but it's not that good.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOnly reason i give the characters a 10/10 is because for a Harem anime, they do a BRILLIANT job at telling each story for each character. Even at the end of this anime, for this last season till we see a S4, they can explain Koneko's true origins, as well as introduce some new characters all pacing it perfectly. As for the other characters, well that's for another review.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSo if it weren't for the story grinding down some during the end of this anime, it would have been a 10/10. But for anyone who is skeptical as to if they should even attempt watching. You will not be disappointed.",

            "content": "One thing I always state about sequels is that they should be better than their predecessor and, the third season of High-School DxD failed at doing that.\r\nLet's s start off with the positive. The opening songBless YoUr NAME by ChouCho is the best song the series has had uptown this point. It is an absolute gem and, without question the best part of the season. Animation again was on point location and, character design were phenomenal. Action sequences were fluid and, seamless. I liked that they expanded the world of the show by introducing Norse mythology such as Odin and, Loki. I liked the backstoriesthey gave Akeno and, Koneko to add some depth to them cuz they were pretty much unengaging beyond belief prior to this. They had their moments and, Akeno had an interesting story prior to this but, it was nice to see some depth be added. The final two episodes of the season were pretty good and, the juggernaut drive was pretty awesome.\\n\\n\r\nNow the bad, both story arcs are recycled from earlier seasons. The first arc is basically a new evil has come and, our heroes have to beat it. The second and, third arcs are word for word the same as the first season. tell me if this sounds familiar, Asia gets kidnapped by a douche, Issei gets pissed and, the group fight a bunch of nameless minions to rescue her. Then, Rias gets taken and, literally the same exact thing happens again. Also, I mention that why they did with Kiba the previous season was really good and, what do they do waste him here. Rias goes from this badass princess type character to jealous love interest which I absolutely hate. Also, I don't know what it is but, I don't  see issei as a main character.\\n\\n\r\nSide note in episode 8 he talks to boobs, he uses his powers to talk to tits. When I watched that for the first time I thought that I was drugged and, that I was hallucinating. That was the weirdest thing I've seen all year, no joke. Also, for some reason the creative team thought I would be a great idea to have Xenovia yell friendship is magic, the tagline for My Little Pony. I laughed at how awful that was.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, I am done with the fan service in the show, I really am. That all I'm gonna say about that.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed a few parts of this season but, it was weird and, lame at times. They stories were completely recycled and, the characters were wasted. I didn't like this season much, and, I dont see myself ever rewatching it aside from the final two episodes.",

It's about the journey. By focusing on Issei's pervertedness and at the same time how he cares about the characters in the story. The show doesn't have to quickly add in fight scenes to be good. I think it's expected to an extent, and there are fans that enjoy that.Essentially, because the anime is good at multiple things it never gets stale and I always enjoyed the show which is saying something since it is a dub of japanese to english so some things don't always sound natural on the show. However, If you just get the general idea of some of the things they were thinking when they made the show it is very entertaining.",

            "content": "Highschool DxD Born is the third season of Highschool DxD anime and ,like the previews seasons, it follows the protagonist Issei Hyodou in his \"quest\" to his evergrowing harem in a world filled with supernatural and shit...\r\nNot surprisingly, the show, true to it's harem and ecchii genre, is heavily built on fanservice as well many types of embarrasing,teasing and erotic moments, so it's probably worth noting that those that expect an incredibly, outstanding story will probably be disappointed.\r\nTHE STORY\r\nIn summary, the story starts with Issei and friends in a trip to hell, during their vacation, in which rapidly envolves them in the great conflict betweenmythologies and the terrorrist organization called \"Chaos Brigade\", and so our heroes must train to become stronger, while at same time they also have to deal with their \"it's not end of world\" but struggling highschool lives. Also worth noting that there are subplots in which our character must help their haremettes with their individual struggles.\\n\r\nOne problem I faced is the oversaturation of mythologies in one story. Like how does it work? Each religion comes with it's universe that most likely contradicts the story of others... like who controls hell? Lucifer? Hades? Hela?\\n\r\nWorld building isn't one of the show's strentgh. Hell doesn't have such a cool and diferents scenarios. Also, although the story revolves about this great mythical war, it isn't left much for the audience to understand it's implications. For one you would something of this scale could greatly if not completlly fuck Earth as we know it, but the topic of how this affects Earth is never mentioned. The audience never feels like a real war is happening. Of course there is a great battle at end, but the enemy is pretty much pulverized and real tension never comes and number of dangerous players in the battle isn't very balanced... Azazel,Lucifer and Odin against who again?. It is mentioned that the Chaos Brigade is constantly attackin the underword, but we never see this or it affects our characters in some meaningul way. The battle against Loki is somewhat nice, but let's be honest... it's really inpractical at all. You are sending a bunch of low level devils agains a F***ING god?Really?\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say really. The art continues to be incredebly appealing with the various despictions of the girls and the music isn't so memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nFirst as always, the protagonist. Issei is a guy that I have found struggle to like. His portrail of a clueless chick magnet, to me, always enters in conflict with the idea of him being a \"chivalrous pervert\"(which is something I don't believe). He manages to get every girl in the group to fall for him, but when the big moment happens, he doesn't go for the kill. Yeah yeah, there is the curse thing, however such obviouness is insanely ridiculous to point that it becomes annoying that he doesn't think the girls have thing for him when they are literally wearing sexy clothes and throwing themselves on him.\\n\r\nThe girls in general receive some character depth and development. Yet it feel like somethings haven't changed. Rias, for all of her jealousy about Issei and the other girls, is still left without a resolution because Issei never comes with terms of having a single girlfriend or a whole harem, putting the issue back to square one. Akeno has aparently resolved her issue with her father, which made her have a negative view on men, while having a illogical attraction for a pervert who seems like the only one with morals. Well, at end she is still very much dependable of Issei. Asia seems to be always put in damsel in distress and her shy attitude doesn't change. I honestly think someone should teach her some fighting skills, but who am I...\\n\r\nThere is also Yuuto and Gasper... well they exist I guess? One is a pretty boy and the other... a prettier boy/girl?\\n\r\nKoneko gains a much more visible development and still remains a likeable character for being the only one who shows some resistance to \"Issei's charm\" and for being a character who has a personality of her own without being related to something necessarily sexual or erotic.\\n\r\nCharacters like Vali, Sirzechs, Azazel, the student council, etc are tolerable and even likeable, although are so much highlighted.\\n\r\nThe villains continue to be one dimensional and well...horrible,disgusting and evil for no other sake.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoymet & Overall\\n\r\nThere can be times when it's enjoyable for it's fanservice even if they sometimes distract the viewer or seem inapropriated in a moment that should be treated seriously. Still, it never manages to become better than it's predecessors, by trying board a bigger story that never is more than superficial.",

Even if Issei is the most perverted character on the anime, but he still my favorite character. I already watch so many season this year. This anime also give me the story of Historical God of war.

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\nProbably going to be \"review\" of the whole franchise pretty much as I haven't reviewed previous seasons.\r\n\u2726Story\r\nWhat else, straightforward ecchi harem route with fantasy battle school element. We get utterly perverted main guy getting entangled with demons. As story goes on more characters get introduced and story itself is mostly solving issues between characters. Whenever main cast team gets hurt, or someone else ends up needing help. And so on.. story is straightforward, perverted, cool action and so on. And since its battle shounen as well, obviouslywe get powerup progression for the main guy.\\n\\n\r\nThis time around issue is a certain \"organization\" who wants to doom it all. And we get some nice nekos. For the most part I enjoy the story, It's good, nothing amazing. Probably has quite some unique quirks, but nothing that I particularly cared about.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art\\n\\n\r\nWell, I do love the artstyle and character design. Ecchi/fanservice side is superb for the most part. But this ecchi is obviously with focus on breasts a.k.a for people with breast fetish. For me personally it's must have aspect of beauty in different froms and shapes, but it isn't simply a \"fetish\" I would be so enthusiastic as this anime presented. Action and powers and whole action part of the animation and art was as well fun and really nice to look at.\\n\\n\r\nPoint being, great art in all aspects, but extra points for those who are really, really into breast.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Sound\\n\\n\r\nQuite nice, some \"classical\" pieces, some great action ost. Oppai songs as well if thats your thing. For most part music felt really great. Emotional tracks were also nice.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\\n\r\nAll kinds of stereotypes. Ultra perverted main guy, who restrict him selves, gets overwhelmed with excitement. Also has great perverted dreams. Some people call him a wimp.. which I can't really comprehend. I mean the whole idea of this type of ecchi is to get teased by sexy women, but don't actually give in into teasing by actually taking the initiative touching them or so. Plus obviously some characters he didn't think as romance targets thus being brave by not giving in into his lust/perversion and know where to limit or back down. Or something along the line\\n\\n\r\nRest of cast is in variety. We get shutin types, quiet types, ojou-sama types, shy & caring types, tomboy types and so on.\\n\\n\r\nProbably the cat sisters are my favorites (older sister then younger) and followed by Rias and Akeno.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment/overall\\n\\n\r\nWhen I started watching this season, first 2 episodes I rated it 6 or so as I couldn't figure out what was the part I enjoyed so much, but as the story went on and more action sequences and also nice eros started to surface, It reminded how much fun it was. It's simple fun, nothing deep. Hot chicks, for most part great fanservice, epic battles. Also I'm sucker for awakening type stuff.",

            "content": "When someone recommends you Highschool DxD and says it is a good anime, beware the fact that this is a harem anime and all harem anime have 0 (or almost 0) plot. But this anime, this franchise is a harem anime with an actual plot. And who would have said, it's actually an ok story. \r\nHarem anime rule #1: You're not for harem anime if you love anime with a good story.\r\nHarem anime rule #2: You're not for harem anime if you hate brainless chicks.\r\nHarem anime rule #3: Do not watch harem anime if you're not okay with the first 2 rules.\r\nBut this anime hasan okay story and it is not full of brainless chicks which just want to f!#k the main character (cough... Infinite Stratos... cough!). I've watched tons of harem anime and before it was a good genre for me (duh I was a perverted teen running high on testosterone xD) but now I don't feel like harem anime is actually a good genre for anybody. Every harem anime: Shy main character blushing 24/7 and not being able to do anything, a total loser at the beginning of the anime and stays the same till the end, freaking ANNOYING chicks which just want his attention for no reason (they just seem to be attracted to a loser) and 0 plot.\\n\\n\r\nBut not this anime. This anime has absolutely NO annoying girls (ok except Xenovia...) and Issei is a loser at the beginning but you can see in BorN that he has come from zero to hero, he can now kill gods while Ichika Orimura (Infinite Stratos again, lol!) still can't do anything. 2 Freaking seasons of an anime and he's as weak as he was in the beginning.\\n\\n\r\nStory: As I said, story is not an important part of harem anime, but this anime actually has a story, so I'll give it an 8. If this was a normal action or romance anime I would have given it a 3, but comparing this story with other harem anime its an 8.   Story: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is absolutely beautiful. Fluid animations, beautiful girls. I gotta say that Rias really is the most beautiful character of all the anime. Not because of her breasts and body, but her face looks seductive and cute af at the same moment.   Art: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: I like the themes. Openings and endings are absolutely fantastic. Except the ending in BorN. Kinda an annoying ending.   Sound:  9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Issei is a perverted dog which cannot be helped in any way. But he isn't blushing 24/7 and the girls aren't annoying. I don't know what to say about the character. It gets the job done.   Character: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If you love eye candy and comedy, you'll absolutely love it. And some action scenes are very good. While harem anime Infinite Stratos (yes again) is a \"mech\" anime but with only 1 fight scene per season. Disgrace.   Enjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This is probably the best harem anime there is. I already said everything I can and I did my best to offend Infinite Stratos. If you are into harem anime you must watch this and if you're not into in this is still a good anime choice.   Overall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nHopefully this review helped you. :)\\n",

I'm kind of annoyed by that, even though the chapter in general is pretty good.\r\nFor me, the biggest disappointments are whatI talked about it in the first line and the last two lines my post above yours. Not getting to see an illustration of the True Queen armor and the way Ise used the Dragon Shot. Though I guess the first one is merely because of my own fault for getting my hopes up too high (and maybe also the illustrator's for drawing the armor a bit differently, since otherwise no one would've thought it could be anything but the regular Balance Breaker armor)",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nMaking it to a third season is definitely a rare sight and even rarer for a harem series and seeing DxD reach this shows how great of a show it truly is.\r\nThe third season continues with Issei and the others as they enjoy their summer by going to the underworld, but their time for relaxation is cut short by the Asgardian known as Loki.\r\nWhat I like about each season is that it expands more and more of the world it is set in as the first season we had devils, angels and fallen angels, the second season we had vampires introduced and nowwe have the Norse Gods in this realm and it was fun seeing Odin and Loki yet no Thor we see his hammer, but not the God of thunder himself.\\n\r\nOnce again the third season is split into 2 arcs the first concentrates on Koneko much like with Kiba in season 2 and we get to see Issei and the others fight against Loki whereas the second half gives a little more concentration on Asia and Ria's along with the Chaos Brigade mischievous actions.\\n\r\nThis is also the first time we get to see the underworld which actually looks pretty nice compared to other illustrations, but we also get to see more of the devils culture and how they live.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters get further development this series along with a few new additions.\\n\r\nIssei has gotten to point now where he can use his full dragon armour with ease now allowing him to take on tougher foes, but we also get to see the full extent of his rage and powers if anything bad was to happen to the girls or his friends.\\n\r\nRia's in this series starts to accept the girls affection towards Issei a bit more this season and actually becomes more paranoid about Issei's feelings towards which leads to her being the final boss of this season which certainly seemed surprising.\\n\r\nAsia gets a little more screentime too and even shows how powerful she is too since after she was rescued by Issei he went into a coma and she managed to use her powers to break him out of it which showed how far she was willing to risk herself to save Issei.\\n\r\nAkeno encounters her father and at first avoids him, but thanks to Issei she tries to reconcile with him so they can rebuild their father-daughter relationship.\\n\r\nKoneko definitely gets the most attention as we get more insight on her past and it is revealed that she is a neko which just immediately increased her cuteness levels, but you see how sad her life was before she meet Ria's and how afraid she was about using her special powers she was born with plus with Issei helping her out her affection for him finally appeared, although she still thinks he is a pervert.\\n\r\nThere are some new characters introduced although they don't have as much impact as previous characters have they were still decent additions.\\n\r\nRossweisse is Odin's security guard who he leaves behind so she stays at Issei's place with the other girls, she is a very fragile person especially when it comes to her love life, but when the fighting gets going she'll definitely kick some ass with her badass Valkyrie armour.\\n\r\nWe even get introduced to Koneko's sister Kuroka who unlike her sister is evil and definitely flirtatious especially around Issei, but she does what she does because she wants to protect her sister.\\n\r\nThe villains in this series certainly don't last very long as soon as they are introduced they are either killed taken captive very quickly, but it felt funny as they monologue how powerful they are and they just get cut down instantly.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle was given new boundaries this season since the new locations we went too looked pretty damn good like the underworld which looked very nice compared to other representations, but the area where the group fights Loki certainly looked lifeless and then there is the dimensional gap which looks like a barren wasteland of colours it was very pretty to look at.\\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice was again very enjoyable and the comedic moments in this series had some great moments that left me laughing like when Issei says to Ria's \"Let me poke them Titties\" that just left me laughing at how funny and cringey it was. \\n\\n\r\nThe action again was very entertaining and we even got to see some giant monster battles which was a spectacle to see along with when Issei went complete berserk dragon mode and destroyed everything in his path which just left me in awe of how powerful he can be if anyone messes with the people he dearly cares about.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a great third series and hopefully whenever season 4 arrives this journey will continue to make me laugh and smile while also getting to see some excellent looking female characters.",

Even thought I enjoyed the sound and art of the anime, it truly killed itself when I see so much inconsistencies and holes within the plot. The convenient coincidences that happens makes everything so predictable. \r\nThe comedy in this animethough is very good. So if you are here for a good laugh. It won't fail in that department.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing too special, but it was appeasing to the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI really liked their use of classical music with this particular anime. Really sets the mood for the anime at various moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 2/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's just bad. All the characters in the anime sometimes would act \"out of character\" or just act in a way that doesn't make sense. It was as if they acted that way to achieve the means to an end.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it. If I just shut my brain off completely, the fan service,comedy, and action was throughly enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\\n\r\nRealistically it would be a 6 if the score averages out.

            "content": "Sigh.\r\nI'm not sure what the heck happened, but... this entry to dxd series is worse than its predessesors in every aspect, maybe with exception of music. Since High School DxD wasn' that great to begin with, result is cringeworthy.\r\nHigh School DxD devolves into a mess of cliches, deus ex machinas, melodramatic moments, and standard shounen scenes. I think the only positive aspects of these series is its attitude towards nudity and character portraits in the middle of the series. There's quite a lot of nudity in the series to the point where you stop caring about it. Character's don't seem to care much about iteither, with exception of protagonist. This is somewhat refreshing, because situations when someone walks onto a half dressed girls which goes \"kyaaa!\" were getting old. Jokes aside...\\n\\n\r\nBasically, it is a disappointing entry to the DxD series.\\n\\n\r\nNow, detailed breakdown.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nBad. It is completely incoherent, full of cliches (both shounen and harem cliches), melodramatic interactions, and have huge amount of deus ex machinas (when things became good for no reason) and diabolus ex machinas (when things go bad for no reason in one frame), which happen often. While technically there is supposed to be a storyline, it is messy and it is hard to keep track of what is going where. Moments that are supposed to feel dramatic, don't feel dramatic, moments that are supposed to be important, don't feel important, and critical scenes look like some sort of farce.  Not sure what the heck happened, I suspect director was replaced by someone else.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nBarely okay, but definitely step down compared to previous series. The visuals for some reason remind me of kaibutsu oujo (that looked fairly \"cheap\"), except that characters are more detailed. The game features character \"pinups\" in the middle, which look great, but they also look better than characters displayed in the actual animation. Backgrounds are universally bad throughout the series - they're obviously CG and not the nice kind of CG. There were quite a lot of shots where there were two or three characters interacting in front of some background that was pretty much devoid of any details and looked like a simple gradient. Characters are in modern simplified style. While someone was paying attention to quality of the girls in the game, secondary characters are not very well drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThis entry uses nice music from previous series, but aside from that there's nothing to add. The music does not complement the story, and simply plays in background. I mean, the melodies can be quite beautiful, but you've heard them all before if you watched previous seasons.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe cast of characters is mostly the same, but interactions between them often does not make any sense. Protagonist keeps obsessing over past events (which were completely forgotten in previous season), and characters often arbitrarily switch moods, enemies start helping enemies for no reason, etc. Characters are supposed to develop over the course of the story, but due to the amount of nonsense that happens in the series, the development is not well portrayed.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nQuite boring, mostly due to issues with the story, art quality, etc. There's only one scene in the whole series that caught my attention, but even in that scene studio managed to mess up and ruin it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nBad. Not sure if I'd recommend it. Most of the episodes are quite bad, last one got slightly better, but I can't think of many reasons to watch this. Maybe if you have a lot of free time and ran out of harem animes to see? Nudity, maybe? It is not that well drawn. Maybe if you really, really wanted to see Rias once more.",

But overall, it was a pretty faithful adaptation, showing the Games & The Juggernaut Drive awakening, which were the two main points to be shown in this season after all... Ijust think it was really bad imagined, and the animation, as many said, sinned compared to the first two seasons. Even so, the adaptation was faithful nonetheless, in my opinion, so I give it a 8/10!",
