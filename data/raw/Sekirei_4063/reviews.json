            "content": "Sekirei is targeted at male audience, viewers who dislike ecchi/harem anime should look elsewhere. Likewise, those who love fan service should give Sekirei a try. It contains all the \"ripped up clothes\" scenes, \"censored panty\" shots, \"semi-bare breasts\", etc. You will not be disappointed.\r\nIt should be noted that while the show does follow the manga quite closely for the most part, the ending of the anime does deviate from the manga a bit.\r\nStory:\r\nAre you familiar with Fate/stay Night? If you are please continue reading this paragraph, if not skip to the next. Upon reading the synopsis, you may find Sekirei's plot to be very similar.In fact, to sum it up in a nutshell, the major difference is that instead of 8 servants fighting each other, this time we have 108 seikirei instead. But rather than only having 1 servant to fight for the master, in the Sekirei world, the master can have as many seikirei as he/she can get.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who are not familiar with Fate/stay Night, Sekirei is about a battle royal between 108 artificially made life forms (disguised as mostly female, though there are some male as well). These life forms, known as sekirei, are to find their Ashikabi (humans with special genes that allows them to partner with sekirei) and fight for them.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe quality of the animation is great as it is done by Seven Arcs, whose work includes the Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha franchise and Inukami!. Everything flows pretty smoothly and characters are drawn in detail, though sadly the show is not broadcast in HD. \\n\\n\r\nThere are occasional scenes that, when compared with the manga's artwork, the level is plainly a grade lower. Hence for those who actually appreciate artist's drawing, I recommend try reading the manga as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are very well rated by most viewers due to the talented casts of seiyu singing them. Talking about seiyu, one should be able to recognize a few names right away. Just to quickly name a few:\\n\\n\r\nKazehana voiced by Yukana Nogami (C.C. in Code Geass, Teletha Testarossa in Full Metal Panic, etc)\\n\r\nTsukiumi voiced by Inoue Marina (Yoko Ritona in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, etc)\\n\r\nAsama Miya voiced by Oohara Sayaka (Milly Ashford in Code Geass, Alicia Florence in Aria the Animation, etc)\\n\r\nMatsu voiced by Endou Aya (Sheryl Nome in Macross Frontier, Lena Sayers in Mai-Otome 0~S.ifr~, Kinue Crossroad in Gundam 00, etc)\\n\r\nKarasuba voiced by Paku Romi (Edward Elric in Full Metal Alchemist, Hitsugaya in Bleach, etc)\\n\\n\r\netc...you get the point\\n\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, this talented casts of seiyu was one of the major selling point for Sekirei (beside fan service of course).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nMany characters tend to be under developed for the most part of the story (this is usually the case when there's half a dozen &quot;main&quot; characters and only a dozen episodes to talk about them). As the series approach the ending, we see quite a lot more development for the main casts, particularly Minato (the male protagonist) and his sekirei. It is also interesting to note that the relationship between Minato and his sekirei throughout the series also provided a lot of entertainment, but more often than not these don't contribute much to character developments.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series very much. Each episode has its own comedy to laugh at and at the same time it still contain enough action and drama to make the overall story attractive enough to me glued to the screen episode after episode. Definitely worth spending your time on.",

            "content": "It doesn\u2019t take a genius to look at the anime page for Sekirei and have a pretty good idea what you are getting yourself into.  But I have a weakness for such shows regardless how silly, played out, and clich\u00e9d they usually are.  I have to say though that with Sekirei I was pleasantly surprised with the results.\r\nThe basic premise for Sekirei was interesting to me.  In a lot of ways it reminded me of the action movie Highlander, only with tits and asses.  The setting is a town in Japan controlled by the massive MBI cooperation.  They are administeringa \"game\" of sorts which pits 108 mysterious girls (and a few boys) called Sekirei against one another in a battle in which only one will get the prize.  Each of the Sekirei binds themselves to a human called an Ashikabi with a kiss which grants them extra powers.  There can be only one... giant pair of boobies.\\n\\n\r\nSekirei does a good job of combining a lot of different genres together and making it work.  Action and fighting anime mixed with harem romance and comedy and a healthy dose of supernatural magic.  It manages to work quite well and despite being a short series there is enough of everything to keep fans entertained.  Though the series doesn\u2019t wrap up the main storyline it ends with an announcement of a second season.  This is good because quite a few unanswered questions remain at the end.  The pacing of the plot is good and it keeps you interested and never feels like its dragging along or becoming repetitive.  It doesn\u2019t always stay on topic but I never found myself minding that much when it didn\u2019t.  Unexpectantly I really did enjoy the harem aspect of the story.  This was one of the few series in which I liked the entire group of girls.  It also may be the only time I wouldn\u2019t mind if there is never a romantic choice between them and the male lead.  They all work so well together and have so much chemistry that I really just think they all belong together.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast overall is a bit mixed but for the most part very good.  It is brought down mainly by an uninspired and uninteresting lead in Minato.  He is your classic harem lead and I really fail to understand why the girls in the cast find him so damn interesting.  It\u2019s not that he\u2019s an unlikable guy, because he is but he is very unoriginal and doesn\u2019t stand out.  Viewers are unlikely to think much of him other than to wish they were in his place.  Besides spouting clich\u00e9s and acting holier than thou he contributes nothing to the plot other than to be saved by his busty harem.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s the harem though that saves the series for me.  I really loved them all, they were hilarious together and while none of them are inspired characters from an originality standpoint they just matched each other so well that they were a lot of fun.  Musubi is the ditsy and airheaded fighter who really just cares about the competition.  Her personality provides for a lot of comedy and a whole lot of fan service.  Early on in the story you would say she was the main love interest and while she may turn out to be that in the end she kind of became just one of the girls by the middle portions of the show.  I didn\u2019t mind this so much because the rest of the girls were fun as well.  Tsukiume is the main rival for Minato's affections with Musubi.  She\u2019s the resident tsundere so of course I loved her immediately.  Like most tsundere characters it seems she underwent the most growth in personality so I felt like I was rooting for her.  Misato stars as the perverted and geeky glasses girl.  She takes more of a backseat with the romance but her personality is more for laughs.  Of course a harem wouldn\u2019t be complete without a loli, Kusano.  Despite me not liking loli's much I have to admit Kuu was pretty damn lovable and impossible to hate.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast and villains is solid but not particularly deep.  Everyone\u2019s favorite is likely to be Miya, the landlady of the house they all live in together.  She\u2019s a bit of a mysterious character in her origins but she acts a bit like a teacher, combat trainer, and a mother.  But dont tell her that or she\u2019ll make a scary aura appear.  Other Ashikabi and their Sekirei appear over the course of the story, some to help and others to fight against our heroes and heroines.  We only get a small taste of the main villains which mostly serve to tease the next season.  Other supporting characters like Uzume and Homura remain mostly clouded in mystery and set for larger roles in the future.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically I can\u2019t say I like Sekirei.  This is not to say the animation and art is bad, because it\u2019s not.  Sekirei really puts the service in fan service and its uncensored version rivals pretty much any other show in terms of its nudity and panty shots.  My main problem though is the unrealistic and silly body measurements and character designs.  The boobs are outrageously huge on practically every non-loli character and really not even that attractive to look at.  They are unrealistically shaped and this is important because you are going to see them ALOT!  Additionally the girls\u2019 bodies are completely malformed with huge hips and asses and tiny waists.  Often characters, particularly Musubi look practically deformed.  It really takes away from the show as I dont think it was necessary.  Dial it down a couple of cup sizes into at least a feasible size range.  The magic and fighting special effects are pretty good though but there are far less of them then there are nipple shots.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the music and voice performances.  I felt the OP/EN theme songs which were performed by the cast were cute and captured the spirit of the series.  Of the seiyuu, I really liked Marina Inoue and Saori Hayama as Tsukiume and Musubi.  They really brought out their respective characters and stole the show.\\n\\n\r\nLooking back I shouldn\u2019t really have liked this series as much as I did.  It\u2019s not remarkable in any aspect except just being entertaining.  If your dont like harems and over the top fan service then you should stay away from this.  However if you have a boob fetish, love service anime, or like fighting anime then Sekirei will probably be an enjoyable experience.\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nSekirei is an anime that has never been a critical darling! However, my good buddy convinced me to ignore all the critics and give this series a shot. Unfortunately...I kind of have to agree with the popular consensus on this one. Sekirei has enough problems to make it very hard for me to recommend.\r\nPlot and characters:\r\nThe plot of Sekirei is that some hot alien chicks crash landed on Earth and an evil corporation is forcing them to pair up with bland males to act as their \u201cmasters\u201d and fight each other to the death in a Battle Royale tournament with the winners getting to ascendinto Godhood. If only I hadn\u2019t seen so many highly similar plots in other shitty anime like: Akikan, Kampfer, Future Diary, etc. It must be said that Sekirei is not exactly going to win any awards for its creativity. Each of these alien girls called \u201cSekirei\u201d have different \u201ctypes\u201d that determine which techniques they can learn and how well they match up against other types based on elemental strengths and weaknesses. Funny, this seems AWFULLY familiar from somewhere! The main character is Minato, who is supposed to be a lovable loser kind of guy that has failed twice getting into Tokyo University and is now studying hard to finally succeed. Seriously! That\u2019s just how little this series tries in terms of creativity. Although I wouldn\u2019t say he is a complete Keitaro from Love Hina ripoff because Keitaro didn\u2019t keep a harem of female slaves that he fought to the death in gladiator matches. I guess Minato is more like Keitaro mixed with Calvin Candie from Django Unchained?! The first Sekirei that Minato gains mastery over is a \u201cfighting type\u201d Sekirei named Musubi. Predictably, Musubi is an airheaded bimbo that lacks any interesting character traits. She loves to eat, flash her tits, and punch other Sekirei in the face. That\u2019s really about as far as her character development goes. My favorite character is the mad scientist leader of the corporation controlling the Sekirei. He is so bombastic and over the top that he actually made me laugh on several occasions, especially in the English dub where he is played by Chuck Huber.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Sekirei is decent and some of the fight scenes look pretty good relative to its year of release. However, I wasn\u2019t a fan of the character designs. The tits are so absurdly large that it just looks fucking stupid! Sekirei\u2019s idea of human anatomy clashed hard with my personal aesthetics.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nSekirei actually did have a few moments that were genuinely funny, or at least so incredibly stupid that I laughed. In one scene, Musubi randomly starts flying and takes Minato into the air to spoof the romance scene from the 1978 Superman film\u2026then she announces that she has no idea how to land and they fall hundreds of feet before crashing into a tree. The fight scenes as mentioned above in the art section are fairly decent and if you simply want to watch some entertaining garbage, this series is passable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nSekirei is not what I would consider a good anime by any stretch. However, it never annoyed me to the degree that Akikan and Kampfer did or infuriate me by being horribly written, yet taking itself dead seriously like Future Diary or Code Geass. Basically, Sekirei is a bad anime, but there are a LOT of anime I hate WAY more than Sekirei! Still, I would avoid this one unless you really want to see some mindless entertainment featuring impossibly busty Pokemon women fighting each other for the sake of a highly cliche' and contrived plot.\\n",

            "content": "I don't know why people ask me to review harem anime. Yes, I've found a few that I liked, but most of them are heavily misogynistic and treat the women like prizes to be won or vapid automatons that have been programmed to chase after this one very ordinary guy regardless of how he treats them or how obviously he rejects them. Who knows, maybe my general distaste for the genre makes people want reviews to see if their particular one will be one of the exceptions or maybe it's a case of people wanting to see me tear an anime a new one andthey figure a harem title has a good chance of filling that role. The series was created by the manga artist, Gokurakuin Sakurako or Sakura Ashika. An artist best known for her shounen ai. The anime adaptation was handled by Seven Arcs, the studio behind Inukami, which was bad and Mahou Shoujp Lyrical Nanoha, which was good. Let's take a look at Sekirei and see if it's one of those rare good harem anime or one of the many that isn't even remotely worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nOur story begins with a ronin named Minato who's just failed to get into University for the second year in a row. As he's walking down the street a girl, Musubi, falls on top of him. She's being chased by lightning hurling twins. She grabs Minato and runs. It turns out she's a Sekirei, a being with super powers that are fully activated by kissing an Ashikabi, which is the title for their masters. The idea is that a hundred and eight of these beings will fight until one is left to claim the ascension prize. The story from there primarily focuses on the various Sekirei that flock to Minato. Just about everything in the series is pretty typical for a harem series. The only real exception is the powered being battle which, as the only potentially interesting element, is pushed into the background. Plus, the execution for what they do have of it is crap. Get this, one of the rules is that Ashikabi are forbidden to mention the Sekirei plan to outsiders, and yet you see the Sekirei fight out in the open where anyone can see them by walking by, opening a window installing a security camera or through various other means. And yet this is supposed to be a secret. That goes past Twilight and to All Star Batman and Robin levels of stupidity. The humour is another element that fails. Sekirei does have an occasional funny joke, but you can count them on the fingers of one hand, assuming a normal number of fingers. The ending is absolute rubbish. They set up for a sequel while having a pandering, arbitrary triumphant moment. The worst aspect of the work as a whole is the absolutely vile treatment of the female characters. They're quite strongly objectified right down to having masters who can, quite literally, claim them whether they like it or not. This is probably the best example of internalised misogyny I've ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are about as nuanced and developed as tissue paper. They're fully typical for what you almost always see in bad harem anime. You have the ordinary protagonist with no special attributes who you're supposed to root for because he's a generically \"good\" character. The perky and air-headed girl. The more aggressive girl. The loli (ewww) and so on. You will never find a real woman who acts like any of these characters, but they're designed to appeal to incredibly shallow and hormonal men so... mission accomplished?\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in this could be generic, but there are several factors that bring it down. The first, and most obvious, being the absurd fan-service. Expect a lot of random panty, ass and breast shots. The fight scenes would be good, but they have the same problem as the action sequences in Highschool of the Dead and Ichiban Ushiro no Daimou, they like to break up the action with fan-service scenes and use the fight scenes as a flimsy excuse to strip the protagonists. Sekirei, stop being stupid. No one is going to do that in a fight. You're going to aim for causing injuries, not ripping someone's clothes. The only way you're going to go for someone's clothes in an actual fight is if they've got loose bits that you can use to pull the person to the ground or to hinder their mobility. The backgrounds are largely dull too. \\n\\n\r\nDon't expect great vocal performances in this. It's almost certainly a case of dull, uninspired characters having voice actors who are good, but can't add depth where the script calls for none. And the problem certainly isn't the actors. You've got Hayami Saori (who was good in both Ano Hana and Sasameki Koto), Inoue Marina (who was good in Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight and Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha Strikers) but if I give examples of good performances for every voice actor this'll be exceedingly long. The point to take away from this little exercise is that the actors are capable, their performances in this are just bad. The music is the best part of the series. It isn't good, it isn't even mediocre, but it's not bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 4/10. There are some decidedly yuri moments in this. \\n\\n\r\nSekirei is terrible. The story is largely typical harem schlock and the atypical element has been done by several, vastly superior anime. The characters are a joke, the treatment of the female characters as objects to be collected is appalling. The sheer idiocy of several of the elements is headache inducing and the fan-service is just ridiculous. I will give it some credit for it's few funny moments and occasional good action sequence, but they certainly aren't worth sitting through the rest of the series to get to. Final rating 2/10. I just hope the next thing on my review request queue is better. Let me see... Sekirei: Pure Engagement. Insert as many expletives here as you like, it probably won't be enough. I'm going to take a couple hours to read Gail Simone before moving on to that, but expect the review next week.",

            "content": "Can you believe what they're doing with the pokemon franchise these days? I mean I know the games are getting stale but jeez Nintendo, I didn't think they would go down the fanservice road by turning the pokemon into big boobie bouncing girls that blindly follow their masters... Oh, hold on, this isn't pokemon, it's just another generic harem ecchi show.\r\nSTORY: College drop out boy meets a cute boobilicious girl and proceeds to move into a dorm with other girls of different shapes and sizes, and also begins his quest after catching his first Sekirei to become a master or something... Okay that's all Igot, the \"Oh it's exactly like those other things\" joke are lazy tiresome and a bit repetitive, but anime like this is exactly what it should only get and deserve.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Sekirei is absolutely nothing different from any ecchi anime you'll see, lazy characterizations? Check! Clueless and borderline retarded female lead? Check! Female lead devoting herself to the main male lead for, no joking about this here, no reason at all and despite they only just met? You know it...\\n\r\nBut, the gimmick this time to get you interested in the tittie show is this is like pokemon, as the Sekirei practiably act like mindless tools for battle and follow their master's demands as this ecchi anime is also a generic action anime, you know, the kind that only clothes take damage (There clothes should only be treated as a health bar before they \"faint\" apparently). Not that it's a terrible idea or anything, but there is an obvious marketing underside to the idea, as the girl just love to repeat what type of Sekirei they are. I'm the fighting type! I'm the fire type! etc, etc...\\n\\n\r\nThe girls range from all kinds of sizes, you got you perfect woman build, the ridiculous proportioned ones, and even a loli so no pervert is left out, as there's enough for all. As character's go... The main lead is too generic to even care about, even his name escapes me (I know I can just look it up on wiki or something but why should I if generic hero of ecchi anime is a more suitable name?)  and the lead female or pokemon-Sekirei whatever has the IQ of half her breast size in centimeters, so there's no dodging the \"oops, I saw your panties\" jokes or \"OMG, you're naked!\" routines, even we get full frontial boobs in this one, but just like any other ecchi, is nothing more than cock teasing to point of saying, \"Why isn't this just a hentai?\"\\n\\n\r\nAll Sekirei manages to do is kill brain cells and empty wallets, well until the next tit anime comes along, and if you're the type to fall for it, then more power to you, because it least you're fueling one of the bigger budget anime producers, Aniplex, and maybe they'll use the money to make more Fate/whatevers or other colored Exorcists so that they can market something not as completely bland as this.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: At least... The animation is fine, action scenes are good and the titties are... well, bouncing, so that's all that should matter anyway for anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: I can't remember, it's forgettable to the point of amnesia. Didn't watch the japanese version as much as the english version, and I did check out Funimation's dub and it's underwhelming, but even Funimation knew that the effort of a good dub would be unfitting for this anime. Chuck Huber is in it as a type-casted professor so at least that's kind of a treat.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ If you're in it for titties, more power to ya.\\n\r\n+ Don't worry, they're animated quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nMixed:\\n\r\n+/- A decent idea / A gimmick used for easier marketing.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- About as deep as every generic harem you've ever seen.\\n\r\n- No memorable character, retard main female lead.\\n\r\n- Forgettable audio, both english and japanese audio are just as lazy.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not trying to talk shit here, and I know I didn't really give this anime a chance (Though I can get enough information from watching two episodes to write a review speaks volumes of how truly little there is offered in this anime in terms of everything but titties) and of course it's only about the titties and it's redundant to criticize the show for it, but this is almost insulting, but if you really want to watch this, try watching it with a few friends and have a blast cracking pokemon references or even do your own Mystery Science Theater 3000 commentary with this show, that's probably the best way to get through this the non-shameless way instead of beating off to this.",

            "content": "Sekirei starts out with your typical pathetic male---couldn't get into college, no close friends, no girlfriend, or any hope at all for anything good to happen in the near future l...until that one fateful day. :P\r\nStory - Pretty generic, yet unique at the same time if that makes any sense whatsoever. Like I said, you've got your typical \"down in the dumps\" male, Minato, who feels like all is lost after not making it into college, but then he meets this girl who instantly connects with him. The girl turns out to be what is called a Sekirei and now Minato is involved in agame known as the Sekirei Plan. 108 Sekirei have been let loose throughout the city, each looking for someone they adore (technical term 'Ashikabi&quot;). After most of them have found their Ashikabi, the game sets into a new development which will cause all of the Sekirei to battle with the winner receiving a prize. That prize is that the Sekirei will be able to live with their Ashikabi forever. However, judging from how the series is going, it doesn't look like we'll see any of that Sekirei Plan game in action this season (assuming they make a second season). Anyway, the good part about the story is the fact that each Ashikabi isn't limited to one Sekirei, so it'll obviously lead to some funny moments when the Sekirei fight over their Ashikabi. However, sometimes I wish that the main character, Minato, would show a little more affection as to the Sekirei he likes instead of trying to treat them all equally. =/ \\n\\n\r\nArt &amp; Sound - The artwork isn't bad, but the females are all generally the same with a few exceptions...big breasted with long hair (with the exception being their personalities). :P The sound isn't bad either, although the OP and ED songs aren't particularly the greatest out there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Well, you're bound to like someone from the show since all of the Sekirei have a unique personality. There are a lot to choose from which would make anyone enjoy the show somewhat. The development could have gone a bit smoother, if you could even pick out any development in the series, but it isn't that bad. Having a favorite character will definitely increase the chance of enjoying the show. :P\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Well, I really like it for some odd reason. I have my favorite Sekirei (Tsukiumi), pairings I like better than others, as well as the anticipation to see what will happen next. It really comes down to if you like Ecchi, Harem, Romance series if you ask me. The action part of the show is practically a bonus for me. With that said, I, personally, really enjoy Sekirei. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Sekirei is an interesting anime that will hopefully have a second season to touch base on the actual storyline of the Sekirei Plan.",

            "content": "Important: Forgive my english please. As a french person it's not very easy for me.\r\nWow!! I'm surprise. I'm not a \"harem with overload of fanservice\" fan, having be introduce to a lot of crappy show in that context by friends *cough*rosario-vampire*cough**cough*to-love-Ru*cough*. I watch this anime cauze I heard a lot of good comment about it. So here's my review...\r\nStory: You have twelve episodes to tell a good serie and sekirei had done this part almost perfectly. Cauze in that kind of show, usually, you don't have a big original story. The stories are classic being concentrated to provide what I call \"overload of fanservice inevery aspect\"( if you understand what I mean by \"aspect\"). This show broke a little bit of those rules by adding a story who has some good moment. Despite the fact that almost every character has oversized-boobs, the fanservice is everywhere, but they don't exagerated things, witch I think was the good move to made. Sure, there's always people who will complain about being a stupid show and I respectfully disagree. I'll explain later in the other segement. \\n\r\nStory: 8/10 for providing a \"descent\" story for a twelve episodes show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Amazing. The character are really well draw and animeted. I think there's some character art that are very original and beautiful. I'm not gonna go so far in the art, cauze I'm not very good to explain every single good things about it. \\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Here's where I'm feeling more ngh. The music is typically not so good in those shows at least in my opinion, but I can undersand the choice of music and the opening doesn't scare the crap out of me *cough*to-love-Ru second opening*cough*. \\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Wow!! Once again, twelve episode show. I didn't expect to have huge character developpement in that kind of context, but at least some characters had there own personnality and you can understand almost everybody why there doing this and that. Minato never became annoying like I don't know...heu...*cough*Aono Tsukune*cough*. Musubi was a hot-blooded character witch I think was funny and a good move to put that. Tsukiumi was my favorite character ( and no, it's not because of her huge breast). I think she had the classic \"I don't need those inferior person\" syndrome and finally she need her Ashikabi more than everyone else, but the way it's handle is perfect and at that time, this can became annoying and it never does. \\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: God what's wrong with me!! I ENJOY THE SHOW!! Me, mecha-fan, there's must be something wrong in my mind. Verification: I still love Gundam, yes or no... yes...ouf... No seriously, I think it's an awesome ride and... well that's it... nothing more, nothing less, \"ENJOYABLE\"!! Enjoyement: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I'm gonna remember that show for a long time. Because I'm someone who search for spectacular story with something we never saw before, and the show has some flaws (like every show does) I can't give more than eight, but if your a \"harem\" fan or someone who simply love anime in general, take a detour on that show, it's worth watching and not necessarily very long.\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10",

Almost all of the girls in the show have giant boobs that hang out or show major cleavage. Also they almost all have really short skirts that show panties in action scenes, or panties flash out of the blue. The male main character gets alot of attention from his Sekirei(really hot girls) that make this hot too. The thing that I think makes Sekirei awesome, though is that unlike most ecchi anime, it actuall has an awesome plot and it has awesome action and fighting. Each girlin the show has a different power that makes the story line kick ass. Examples are controlling water, plants, wind, or just having super strength.",

            "content": "Sekirei truly suprised me. I started watching it just thinking it was going to be a pure fanservice show with a bad story (Like Queen's Blade lol) but instead I got a very enjoyable adventure. This is my first review here so I'll break each section down.\r\nStory (8)\r\nI was expecting poor plot but instead I got a story that actually really managed to get me involved. Sekirei are basically superpowered chicks and a couple of pretty boys. They select a human to form a bond with in order to bring out their full power. These humans are called Ashikabi's and for the most part seemto be clueless guys lol. The main idea is that there's a tournament that all 108 of the Sekirei will be competing in. The winner will get to stay with their Ashikabi forever. It seems simple enough but a lot of things happen that spice the story up.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7)\\n\r\nI have mixed feelings about the art because it tends to change from time to time. Some scenes look excellent while others look like they're from a diffrent show. This doesn't happen enough to make me dislike the art though.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6)\\n\r\nI'm fairly neutural when it comes to the sound. The voice acting is pretty good but the music's a bit feminine for my taste. There's nothing really wrong with that, I just wish there was more kick ass action songs lmao.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9)\\n\r\nThis is where Sekirei really shines. The characters are all unique and it's practically impossible to not find someone you like. The only reason I don't give the characters a perfect score is because Minato and Musubi are the least interesting of all. That could be a problem for some people since they're the main characters. On the other hand others tend to like them so it's all a matter of opinion. Tsukiumi's my favorite because I love her attitude and her powers.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8)\\n\r\nIt's a very amusing show. Anyone with a sense of humour will be laughing every other minute as they watch this. The action scenes are also relaly good for the most part. I just wish they had fleshed out some of the background characters a little bit more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8)\\n\r\nAnyone who doesn't like fanservice should beware because there's plenty. It is one of the better one's however because they actually work the fanservice into the plot. All in all Sekirei's a solid anime that I'll probably end up buying on dvd.",

            "content": "This is the other type of animes (besides gory and bloody animes) that I often most likely feel like watching. This is an action-echi-comedy anime. It's like any other you've watched (for instance Tenjou Tenge, Ikkitousen) but this one has a more \"pokemon-cath 'em style\" theme if you know what I mean. I will include full descriptions in this review because I feel that even if I spoil the story or other stuff you will enjoy this anime not because of the story specifically. Also this anime has, halfway through, explicit content, specifically: nudity. So it's not suitable for underage audiences. \r\nThe story is prettymuch straight forward as for any of this echi animes. You know: a somewhat failure type of guy is deppressed all over something and then when he is walking home he get's to meet a really beautiful girl that cames out of nowhere and just after that the girl, for whatever reason, get's to stay in the guy's house\". The twist is that this girl is one of the \"Sekireis\" that the worldwide famous MBI company has let out to provoke a \"Battle Royale\" scenario between the sekireis in the city called \"New Tokyo\". Now this girls have a wide range of super powers (water, fire, psychical, etc.) and fight in order to get their wish of being with the person they love forever come true. \\n\\n\r\nThis girls need to \"be winged\" in order to be able to use their full power, they do this by mixing their DNA with a human's DNA: by kissing. Now the story is set just in a like 10 year gap from the present (2019 or something like that). So most of the stuff you see on the enviroment is as just realistic as watching it anywhere else for real. Another thing that I did found different in this anime compared with others of this genre (le's take Ikkitousen and Tenjou Tenge) is the reason behind the fights. In Ikkitousen they just fight to \"fullfill the destiny of the magatama\" in \"Tenjou Tenge there is really no reason at all xD! Here you've got better and realistic event that causes the fighting to begin.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a Seven Arcs artistic produccion so it's obviously very good. The design  of the backgrounds and specially the characters is superb. The characters are very nice to watch in action and the animation doesn't miss almost any amount of detail in fight sequences. The space of action get's it's great dose of originality as well. The locations are often destroyed nicely and when that happens it's does looks realistic and it does leave a chaotic-satisfactory feeling. Another thing this anime has to deal with is the fan service issue. Yes this anime shows almost all sekireis as big breasted babes, of course there are exceptions but that is the main idea. This babes are vey teasing and seductive from time to time, so expect some hardcore echi escenes.  But even so respecting looks every single one of the characters is different from one another by some characteristic features, even so the overall body type is the same. The characters are drawn so well that you see that they are completely different in some way or another.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't got much to say about to say about the sound. The opening and ending themes are a bit gilrlish, but then again it all comes down if they fit the theme or not, well.. at the end they do. Voice acting is a important factor in an anime too. Well in here the voice acting is superb: love Tsukiumi's voice (love everything about her really) and Karasuba's as well (lol the voice talent is the same as Hitsugaya Toushirou and Elric Edward). The sound is nice and complements this anime making it a great listening experience.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters are amazing and have very different behaviors. I'm in love with the beautiful blond, short-tempered and violent Tsukiumi, I fancy the peaceful, determined and voluptuous Musubi and definitely want the perverted, seductive and smart Matsu. Even the secondary characters or just those that only appear in one or two episodes have a great amount of detail respecting looks and personality so you'll be willing to see more of those characters even if they don't show up anymore on the storyline. You will definitely feel symphaty for the vast majority of the cast and even get attached to them.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is something perfect about this anime, leaving aside the artistic design, I've got to say that the enjoyment impact that acomplishes on the viewer is somewhat different from another aspects this anime offers. The enjoyment factor is high quality and I don't know about other people but I'm really anxious and looking forward for the OVA and the second season. Why? Well because I did greatly enjoy it. If you are not a echi fan and are only used to watch animes with elaborate stories and difficult scripts then definitely this one is not for you, as you will see the story as lame and with no sense at all. But if you're looking for fun, great, sexy looking characters and no great complications in storyline issues then this is one anime you should seriously considering watching.\\n",

I have no problem with that genre, honest, but this anime was not for me. I dropped it after seeing more than half of it, but I know the rest of the plot by reading spoilers.\r\nI noticed that a reviewer named \"Chasekun\" compared Sekirei to Fate/stay night. All I have to say in response to that is...\r\n \"Are you nuts?! Have you actually SEEN Fate/stay night before, Chasekun?!\" \r\nThe two couldn't be more different. While, yes, there is a very superficial similarity in the \"Masters/Ashikabi with Servants/Sekirei\" dynamic and thatthere is fighting between Servants/Sekirei. But that's it. Fate/stay night is far, far deeper and much more thought-provoking, especially the original visual novel\u2014 the anime adaptation is quite lackluster in comparison to the VN, but even the anime of Fate/stay night has much more substance to it than Sekirei. Interesting and well-developed characters and actual character development, dynamic plot (the VN actually has three different routes/stories each with multiple paths), actually well-thought-out mechanics for things like magic (this reviewer thinks so, anyways), etc.; I could go on but that isn't the point of this review. \\n\\n\r\nSekirei, on the other hand...\\n\\n\r\nStory: Poor. There's not really much of a story here when you look past the feeble attempts at establishing a plot. It's pretty much exactly what is written (or rather, drawn) on the box. As I'm sure you've read in other reviews, it's basically an excuse to have 100+ super-powered chicks duke it out\u2014oh, two or three of the Sekirei are bishounen instead. The story is written to basically allow for the premise of \"big titty aliens with superpowers in a battle harem, inexplicably having fallen in love with a completely unremarkable spineless loser (lol, only in anime can this happen), beating the crap out of other big titty aliens with superpowers for an arbitrary reason\". That may seem harsh, but it's literally what the story is when you sift through all the padding put in place to make it seem like there is actually something there.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Mediocre. I'm kind of spoiled by series with far better artwork now, though, so I'm not impressed, can't help that. Also, I tend to like more realism in character designs, rather than the style of \"impossibly wide hips, huge butts, and massive boobs\". Also, there is something about their faces that just feels wrong to me... I think it's the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fair. Nothing groundbreaking or amazing. Voices are decent, at least in the Japanese version (I'm not sure if there is a dubbed version of this yet, nor am I really inclined to find out). Essentially, nothing I didn't already expect, but that isn't a bad thing, exactly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Poor. Characters are pretty much static cliches meant to be the carriers of tropes commonly seen in harem anime. Let's see... the main male character is more of a pathetic weenie than Keitaro of Love Hina, and not even nearly as noticeable or amusing as him; he's just sort of... there. Main female character is... hmm, \"empty headed\" is the best way to describe her; she's one of those vapid \"I don't have 'common sense' so I sound like a moron when I ask questions about things that should be self-evident to any normal person\" types. After her we have a scary onee-san landlady (probably one of the most interesting characters in the story), psuedo-playboy but not really bishounen Sekirei, amiable tomboy lesbian sekirei (also one of the most interesting characters, and not because she's lesbian, mind you), lazy pervert bum guy and his twin tsundere lightning sekirei, token loli sekirei, lecherous old man type big titty hacker sekirei, possessive violent tsundere sekirei, sensual stripper older woman bottle fairy sekirei, bloodthirsty insane sword sekirei, main character's weird perverted somewhat domineering little sister and her shota dark-is-not-evil sekirei, his domineering smoker researcher mom, batshit crazy mega-corporation head, and many more largely irrelevant characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Poor. Personally, I prefer stories that are actually substantial and not a flimsy cover for a ecchi fanservice harem situation. I like stories where the characters are actually modeled like real people with dynamic moods and personalities, and not essentially one-dimensional harem tropes designed for the sole purpose of ecchi comedy. I like stories that engage me intellectually and make me think, not mindless perversion barely hidden behind a cobbled-together plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Decent, actually. While I didn't finish it, I didn't exactly hate it. I didn't like it either. In the end, it does what it set out to do\u2014provide ecchi comedy\u2014pretty well. However, I'm not exactly interested in something lacking this much substance, since I'm a thinking type of guy. Basically? If you want to just sit back, veg, and watch something ecchi that doesn't require much thought and has lots of girls with big tits and butts? Sekirei is for you. If you want to watch something that actually requires you to pay attention to the story because it has an involved plot, with developed characters? Try something like Fate/stay night (especially the original visual novel, it's a fantastic read) instead.",

            "content": "Sekirei has a very obvious harem premise, so caution is required by those who usually dislike this type of anime: 108 creatures, mostly female, spread all over town are to be either willingly or unwillingly \"winged\" by human masters through the exchange of bodily fluids, most commonly through a kiss, and engage in a battle royale to decide which pair will win and \"ascend together unto heaven\".\r\nStory:\r\nThe plot is linear and simple, a few mysteries are contained as to the identities and motivations of some characters, as well as the true nature of the Sekirei Plan. An interesting aspect of it is the high degreeof faithfulness to the manga it's derived from, to the point of the viewer, by the end of the series, be able to pick up the subsequent manga volume and read it without major issues.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art doesn't manage to impress, but the quality is very consistent throughout, and it's very hard to perceive poorly made moments due to low budget. The battle animations and choreography are, however, better than one would expect from a series of this scope, and it also gives fans who come in from the manga interesting details on each Sekirei's powers.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe intro and outro songs fit the mood of the content, the background music is good but not outstanding. On the other hand, voice acting is a very catching aspect of it, with a couple higher profile actresses(namely Marina Inoue and Paku Romi, both usually typecast for bold female and young male roles). Since most of the comedy comes from the interaction of the main cast with itself, thiswas a central part of the production which was not overlooked.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAs a typical harem series, most of the humor is derived from the eccentric and fixed personalities of the main characters, and most of the character development focuses on the protagonist, and is quite a small amount. Most of the Sekirei only change their reactions significantly shortly after and during the process of being winged, and remain unchanged after that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nSekirei is a good series, with a sufficiently fast pace that will keep most people hooked. It's leaving a lot of fans with hopes for future seasons, even though I personally find the possibility to be unlikely. It offers a small twist to the harem genre having the combat aspects and multiple masters with small harems of their own, and has been likened to Pokemon by many. In the end, a fitting work for it's short run of 12 episodes.",

            "content": "Sekirei is actually a pretty generic show in terms of plot, characters, story, and art.  The ecchi and harem aspect can immediately put people off.  With those things in mind, this is by far one of my most favorite hidden gems in anime that i've found.\r\nb-b-b-but you gave its a 7??  Yes i did, that's b/c the anime isn't finished; there are two seasons and many rumors about a third.  This is also the first anime that has made me pick up the manga.  If the story were complete, or at least if there were more episodes, this would geta 9 from me.\\n\\n\r\nSekirei is about a game played in a large metropolitan city with humanoids (mainly females) having strange abilities that go around battling one another trying to find an ashkabi (mainly male) for them to latch onto and battle for/protect.  Its like a giant battle royal with wild fight scenes and an enormous depth of back story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Sekirei unique is how well its executed, the characters, while largely generic fit perfectly with the setting and context of the game, and there are many different types of characters that surround the MC, alot of them are very powerful.  It makes for an exciting dynamic.  The anime is almost a SoL though, as it doesn't really take off into crazy town until the second season, but i found that it kept me wanting more and more and more.  After each episode the show just got better and better.  the progression was almost perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some drawbacks however, namely the MC is a pussy.  What makes this even slightly tolerable is that there is a very slow progression to his character and while he is often aloof, naive, shy and stuttering, he isn't a sniveling, groveling weakling that just makes you hate his guts.  \\n\\n\r\nThere's also a fair amount of ecchi with tits and red faces popping up in almost every episode.  It isn't Highschool DxD level, but there's no doubt they are catering to the fanservice crowd.  Thankfully it doesn't really get in the way, as most of the fanservice scenes serve multiple purposes to further the character development or the plot.\\n\\n\r\nEven with the individual elements being somewhat generic, the way their are positioned makes the show particularly unique and especially interesting.  I've watched my fair share of animu, this is one of those shows that really grabbed my attention from the start and never let me down.  And generic works to make the characters relate-able and interesting early and b/c of this its very easy for them to break their mold and surprise the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can handle some ecchi and are looking to be thoroughly entertained, can't do much better than Sekirei, it has a little bit of everything without being overbearing.",

            "content": "Sekirei is considered by many to be an underrated gem of its genre. It is definitely a classic harem anime in the sense that we know the main character is not going to pick any of the girls due to his demeanor and the circumstances surrounding the plot. I personally dropped this anime after episode 3 the first time I attempted to watch it. However, after a couple months, I came back to it and it has grown on me, very much so.\r\nFor as infamous as this show is for it's very frequent nudity, big-breasted sex-appeal women, and emphasis on Ecchi, Seikirei does actually havea very fascinating plot and setting which balances out its constant innuendos. The Sekirei concept in itself feels much like a mixture of Pok\u00e9mon, The Hunger Games, and The Running Man all weaved into one (with a lot of drama and \"slice of life\" atmosphere thrown in). The plot has a fair amount of good action and enough of an actual story line of depth to yank it from the category of an anime that is \"just being an Ecchi for ecchi's sake\" but not enough to make it more about the story either. So it balances itself quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot and concept/constructs of the story are nicely thought out and explained adequately as the story unfolds (at some point, a confusion you may be having will always be addressed). The whole concept of the Sekireis, Ashikabis, the Disciplinary Squad, and government structure of the Sekirei project offer a depth that matches many \"fair\" anime adventure series (I say \"fair\" because the plot is well-done/laid out, but also isn't flat-out amazing either).\\n\\n\r\nMinato Sahashi, the male lead and protagonist, in my opinion, is the show's weakest point. Much like Yusuke Takasaki from the infamous anime: Green Green (but not AS bad), he is a very tasteless character that kind of just has to be there for the plot's sake and structure.  By season 2, he grows a small bit and I probably accepted him more than in the first season due to the simple factor of time.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sekirei, for the most part, are what make this anime interesting. Their personality differences as well as their constant fighting to be Minato's one love, is highly comical and at times, super sweet (when they get a moment to themselves with him).\\n\\n\r\nFor me personally, Musubi and Tsukiumi are my favorite players in this anime drama. They both have very much potential (in my personal opinion) as showing quality traits of girls I personally would love to marry (Musubi more than Tsukiumi). This aspect is definitely one of the more core reasons I like this anime. The loyalty and dedication of Minato's Sekirei to their Ashikabi, is quite beautiful and romantic/\"wifely\" if you let it be.  Attaching to a character will definitely help you ride out the entire show MUCH better.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are nothing to write home about but are good enough that they don't distract from the characters and plot at hand.  The opening theme to both seasons of the show are very well-done in terms of music.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, a statement I once heard vulgarly put to describe this show was: \"it's like Pok\u00e9mon, except with big-titted women.\" Though that statement in the raw sense is true, yes....the show is definitely more than that. It isn't a flat-out amazing show, but most of the characters are quite interesting and you can definitely get attached to them. Overall: Good plot/setting/story, funny comedy, mostly all likable characters (a few I can't stand), very well-done opening theme song, and exciting super powered action when it's around. Sekirei is definitely a decent anime for the genre-mix it is trying to be.\\n\\n\r\n(Warning: Season 2 ends on a \"to be continued\" cliff-hanger and Season 3 will probably never be created/released to conclude the story, due to a few reasons you can research yourself. With this in mind, just realize that you won't get closure if you decide to get into this anime.)",

            "content": "Review #5: Sekirei\r\nStory 7/10 -- The Story is semi unique I suppose to most action harems. 108 Girls with a variety of skills and martial arts descend onto the city, not only to find each other, but to find compatible masters in which there are many. I think what makes season 1 a good story is that they make the action intense in a series that is life and death for these girls. However I felt that Minato and other masters roles are fairly underused, and the point of this battle royale seems underwhelming by the enemies claims. The dialogue was decent, but I preferthe plot and events of season 2.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10 -- Seven Arcs actually hasn't done many works, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha is what they are mainly known for, and there last anime series that drew any major attention was Trinity Seven back in 2014. I liked the design of the characters, and the contrast gave a good manga feel. The lighting was nice in some scenes, however some other scenes lost a bit of quality in the moment. The fight scenes overall were executed standard, but nothing above average.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10 -- If you don't know the cast that went into this show, you are missing out in the sound department. The OP and ED were pretty good, with several known voice actors voicing characters in this series. However, the dialogue again was very plain, and underwhelming for the talent they had.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10 -- Oh Man, how many harem animes are there where every girl says the main characters name in one scene. While Minatos dream is the type you wanna root for, you can't help but wish another team was lurking in the background with a better set of motivation. This harem lacked depth in it's characters, mainly because of the lack of any change throughout the show. Seemed like the enemy was revealed more then our protagonists, and the lack of development just killed this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10 -- This show is fairly enjoyable if you like ecchi, action, and next level fighting. I think the concept of a harem battle royale sounds interesting, but like every other anime, the production has to have consistent quality throughout the series to keep it interesting. Some scenes were better then others, and I still prefer the arcs in the next season. There's also some appeal in rooting for the underdog, as I find his wish to be respectful of everyone fighting, and it actually sounds possible.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10 -- The characters make and break this show. You will either like it or you won't. Personally I thought the concept overall had lots of potential, and the cast also looked very good. The story was fairly decent, but I didn't like the limited dialogue or the lack of character development, and that makes me drop the score from a seven to six.\\n\\n\r\n~Castawayz",

            "content": "After seeing how so many people gave this a really high rating, I had to review.\r\nFirst off, this show is one of the worst anime series I have ever seen (the other being Upotte!). \r\nStory: The story is extremely lame, seeing as it is about a student who cannot get into college who cannot do anything at all (how original). One day, as he is walking through the city, a random girl just happens to land on him in midst of a battle. Thus, the start of a weird \"adventure.\" One by one, he meets more of these weird girls that become known as Sekirei.Sekirei are forced to fight the other Sekirei in order to prevail victorious in order to spend all of eternity with their Ashikabi, or their loved one.  However, the only thing that really happened was Minato randomly running into new girls, \"conquering\" them, and thats pretty much it. If you only want to see boobs and other ecchi stuff, I would say shoot for Sekirei. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in my opinion was a little annoying. I hated seeing the character designs as something just didnt feel right about them. Normally, a harem anime (in my opinion) should have at least cute girls in them. The poor designs were just a major pain to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Although the voice cast was good, I absolutely couldn't stand Minato's voice both in Japanese and the Dubbed version. He sounded so nasaly and useless that it made me want to bang my head on the keyboard repeatedly. The rest of the people sounded very exhausted and not very enthusiastic about the characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: It's something we have seen in almost every harem genre: a useless male lead with many supposedly cute girls fall for him for either his kindness or just random reason. In this case, they love him for his kindness (i think). Each Sekirei have their own ability/ power, such as controlling plants or water. \\n\\n\r\nI remember when I was watching this, I wondered why I was making myself go through that kind of torture. I literally thought before an episode, \"When will this be over?\" or \"Will i make it through this episode?\" \\n\\n",

Prepare for \"oops, my clothes ripped!\" Scenes as well as \"the wind has conveniently moved my skirt up and I'm not wearing shorts!\" Prepare for a lot of underwear and boobs. Lots and lots of boobs. (OPPAI! XD)\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nNow, if you don't focus on the random boobs and underwear popping up everywhere, this anime has a pretty good plot. So, this guy named Minato Sahashi is walking down the sidewalk when a big-boobed girl falls from the sky and lands on him! (This panty-shot is provided to youin part by OPPAI and co.) She is fighting these two twins, also big boobed, with these random lighting bolts. She takes him to an alleyway and kisses him, making her a lot stronger. Later, she tells him that she is a Sekirei, basically an alien with superpowers, who have been put into the city to fight each other. There are many other Sekirei in the city including Musubi (big boobs and \"I don't really care if I'm half-naked\" girl) and the twins.\\n\r\nThat was just a basic premise. It's actually pretty interesting if you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art's pretty good, it has cool fight scenes and a lot of boob physics. The sound is nothing too special.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nThis is another harem/ecchi anime so there really isn't any character development. There's some, but it's unnoticeable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy it as much as a guy would. I still liked it fairly well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nI suggest this for men who like boobs and pantsu. Lots of pantsu. (So much pantsu...)",

            "content": "Sekirei is targeted at male audience, viewers who dislike ecchi/harem anime should look elsewhere. Likewise, those who love fan service should give Sekirei a try. It contains all the \"ripped up clothes\" scenes, \"censored panty\" shots, \"semi-bare breasts\", etc. You will not be disappointed.\r\nIt should be noted that while the show does follow the manga quite closely for the most part, the ending of the anime does deviate from the manga a bit.\r\nStory:\r\nAre you familiar with Fate/stay Night? If you are please continue reading this paragraph, if not skip to the next. Upon reading the synopsis, you may find Sekirei's plot to be very similar.In fact, to sum it up in a nutshell, the major difference is that instead of 8 servants fighting each other, this time we have 108 seikirei instead. But rather than only having 1 servant to fight for the master, in the Sekirei world, the master can have as many seikirei as he/she can get.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who are not familiar with Fate/stay Night, Sekirei is about a battle royal between 108 artificially made life forms (disguised as mostly female, though there are some male as well). These life forms, known as sekirei, are to find their Ashikabi (humans with special genes that allows them to partner with sekirei) and fight for them.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe quality of the animation is great as it is done by Seven Arcs, whose work includes the Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha franchise and Inukami!. Everything flows pretty smoothly and characters are drawn in detail, though sadly the show is not broadcast in HD. \\n\\n\r\nThere are occasional scenes that, when compared with the manga's artwork, the level is plainly a grade lower. Hence for those who actually appreciate artist's drawing, I recommend try reading the manga as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are very well rated by most viewers due to the talented casts of seiyu singing them. Talking about seiyu, one should be able to recognize a few names right away. Just to quickly name a few:\\n\\n\r\nKazehana voiced by Yukana Nogami (C.C. in Code Geass, Teletha Testarossa in Full Metal Panic, etc)\\n\r\nTsukiumi voiced by Inoue Marina (Yoko Ritona in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, etc)\\n\r\nAsama Miya voiced by Oohara Sayaka (Milly Ashford in Code Geass, Alicia Florence in Aria the Animation, etc)\\n\r\nMatsu voiced by Endou Aya (Sheryl Nome in Macross Frontier, Lena Sayers in Mai-Otome 0~S.ifr~, Kinue Crossroad in Gundam 00, etc)\\n\r\nKarasuba voiced by Paku Romi (Edward Elric in Full Metal Alchemist, Hitsugaya in Bleach, etc)\\n\\n\r\netc...you get the point\\n\\n\r\nBelieve it or not, this talented casts of seiyu was one of the major selling point for Sekirei (beside fan service of course).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nMany characters tend to be under developed for the most part of the story (this is usually the case when there's half a dozen &quot;main&quot; characters and only a dozen episodes to talk about them). As the series approach the ending, we see quite a lot more development for the main casts, particularly Minato (the male protagonist) and his sekirei. It is also interesting to note that the relationship between Minato and his sekirei throughout the series also provided a lot of entertainment, but more often than not these don't contribute much to character developments.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series very much. Each episode has its own comedy to laugh at and at the same time it still contain enough action and drama to make the overall story attractive enough to me glued to the screen episode after episode. Definitely worth spending your time on.",

            "content": "It doesn\u2019t take a genius to look at the anime page for Sekirei and have a pretty good idea what you are getting yourself into.  But I have a weakness for such shows regardless how silly, played out, and clich\u00e9d they usually are.  I have to say though that with Sekirei I was pleasantly surprised with the results.\r\nThe basic premise for Sekirei was interesting to me.  In a lot of ways it reminded me of the action movie Highlander, only with tits and asses.  The setting is a town in Japan controlled by the massive MBI cooperation.  They are administeringa \"game\" of sorts which pits 108 mysterious girls (and a few boys) called Sekirei against one another in a battle in which only one will get the prize.  Each of the Sekirei binds themselves to a human called an Ashikabi with a kiss which grants them extra powers.  There can be only one... giant pair of boobies.\\n\\n\r\nSekirei does a good job of combining a lot of different genres together and making it work.  Action and fighting anime mixed with harem romance and comedy and a healthy dose of supernatural magic.  It manages to work quite well and despite being a short series there is enough of everything to keep fans entertained.  Though the series doesn\u2019t wrap up the main storyline it ends with an announcement of a second season.  This is good because quite a few unanswered questions remain at the end.  The pacing of the plot is good and it keeps you interested and never feels like its dragging along or becoming repetitive.  It doesn\u2019t always stay on topic but I never found myself minding that much when it didn\u2019t.  Unexpectantly I really did enjoy the harem aspect of the story.  This was one of the few series in which I liked the entire group of girls.  It also may be the only time I wouldn\u2019t mind if there is never a romantic choice between them and the male lead.  They all work so well together and have so much chemistry that I really just think they all belong together.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast overall is a bit mixed but for the most part very good.  It is brought down mainly by an uninspired and uninteresting lead in Minato.  He is your classic harem lead and I really fail to understand why the girls in the cast find him so damn interesting.  It\u2019s not that he\u2019s an unlikable guy, because he is but he is very unoriginal and doesn\u2019t stand out.  Viewers are unlikely to think much of him other than to wish they were in his place.  Besides spouting clich\u00e9s and acting holier than thou he contributes nothing to the plot other than to be saved by his busty harem.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s the harem though that saves the series for me.  I really loved them all, they were hilarious together and while none of them are inspired characters from an originality standpoint they just matched each other so well that they were a lot of fun.  Musubi is the ditsy and airheaded fighter who really just cares about the competition.  Her personality provides for a lot of comedy and a whole lot of fan service.  Early on in the story you would say she was the main love interest and while she may turn out to be that in the end she kind of became just one of the girls by the middle portions of the show.  I didn\u2019t mind this so much because the rest of the girls were fun as well.  Tsukiume is the main rival for Minato's affections with Musubi.  She\u2019s the resident tsundere so of course I loved her immediately.  Like most tsundere characters it seems she underwent the most growth in personality so I felt like I was rooting for her.  Misato stars as the perverted and geeky glasses girl.  She takes more of a backseat with the romance but her personality is more for laughs.  Of course a harem wouldn\u2019t be complete without a loli, Kusano.  Despite me not liking loli's much I have to admit Kuu was pretty damn lovable and impossible to hate.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast and villains is solid but not particularly deep.  Everyone\u2019s favorite is likely to be Miya, the landlady of the house they all live in together.  She\u2019s a bit of a mysterious character in her origins but she acts a bit like a teacher, combat trainer, and a mother.  But dont tell her that or she\u2019ll make a scary aura appear.  Other Ashikabi and their Sekirei appear over the course of the story, some to help and others to fight against our heroes and heroines.  We only get a small taste of the main villains which mostly serve to tease the next season.  Other supporting characters like Uzume and Homura remain mostly clouded in mystery and set for larger roles in the future.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically I can\u2019t say I like Sekirei.  This is not to say the animation and art is bad, because it\u2019s not.  Sekirei really puts the service in fan service and its uncensored version rivals pretty much any other show in terms of its nudity and panty shots.  My main problem though is the unrealistic and silly body measurements and character designs.  The boobs are outrageously huge on practically every non-loli character and really not even that attractive to look at.  They are unrealistically shaped and this is important because you are going to see them ALOT!  Additionally the girls\u2019 bodies are completely malformed with huge hips and asses and tiny waists.  Often characters, particularly Musubi look practically deformed.  It really takes away from the show as I dont think it was necessary.  Dial it down a couple of cup sizes into at least a feasible size range.  The magic and fighting special effects are pretty good though but there are far less of them then there are nipple shots.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the music and voice performances.  I felt the OP/EN theme songs which were performed by the cast were cute and captured the spirit of the series.  Of the seiyuu, I really liked Marina Inoue and Saori Hayama as Tsukiume and Musubi.  They really brought out their respective characters and stole the show.\\n\\n\r\nLooking back I shouldn\u2019t really have liked this series as much as I did.  It\u2019s not remarkable in any aspect except just being entertaining.  If your dont like harems and over the top fan service then you should stay away from this.  However if you have a boob fetish, love service anime, or like fighting anime then Sekirei will probably be an enjoyable experience.\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nSekirei is an anime that has never been a critical darling! However, my good buddy convinced me to ignore all the critics and give this series a shot. Unfortunately...I kind of have to agree with the popular consensus on this one. Sekirei has enough problems to make it very hard for me to recommend.\r\nPlot and characters:\r\nThe plot of Sekirei is that some hot alien chicks crash landed on Earth and an evil corporation is forcing them to pair up with bland males to act as their \u201cmasters\u201d and fight each other to the death in a Battle Royale tournament with the winners getting to ascendinto Godhood. If only I hadn\u2019t seen so many highly similar plots in other shitty anime like: Akikan, Kampfer, Future Diary, etc. It must be said that Sekirei is not exactly going to win any awards for its creativity. Each of these alien girls called \u201cSekirei\u201d have different \u201ctypes\u201d that determine which techniques they can learn and how well they match up against other types based on elemental strengths and weaknesses. Funny, this seems AWFULLY familiar from somewhere! The main character is Minato, who is supposed to be a lovable loser kind of guy that has failed twice getting into Tokyo University and is now studying hard to finally succeed. Seriously! That\u2019s just how little this series tries in terms of creativity. Although I wouldn\u2019t say he is a complete Keitaro from Love Hina ripoff because Keitaro didn\u2019t keep a harem of female slaves that he fought to the death in gladiator matches. I guess Minato is more like Keitaro mixed with Calvin Candie from Django Unchained?! The first Sekirei that Minato gains mastery over is a \u201cfighting type\u201d Sekirei named Musubi. Predictably, Musubi is an airheaded bimbo that lacks any interesting character traits. She loves to eat, flash her tits, and punch other Sekirei in the face. That\u2019s really about as far as her character development goes. My favorite character is the mad scientist leader of the corporation controlling the Sekirei. He is so bombastic and over the top that he actually made me laugh on several occasions, especially in the English dub where he is played by Chuck Huber.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in Sekirei is decent and some of the fight scenes look pretty good relative to its year of release. However, I wasn\u2019t a fan of the character designs. The tits are so absurdly large that it just looks fucking stupid! Sekirei\u2019s idea of human anatomy clashed hard with my personal aesthetics.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nSekirei actually did have a few moments that were genuinely funny, or at least so incredibly stupid that I laughed. In one scene, Musubi randomly starts flying and takes Minato into the air to spoof the romance scene from the 1978 Superman film\u2026then she announces that she has no idea how to land and they fall hundreds of feet before crashing into a tree. The fight scenes as mentioned above in the art section are fairly decent and if you simply want to watch some entertaining garbage, this series is passable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nSekirei is not what I would consider a good anime by any stretch. However, it never annoyed me to the degree that Akikan and Kampfer did or infuriate me by being horribly written, yet taking itself dead seriously like Future Diary or Code Geass. Basically, Sekirei is a bad anime, but there are a LOT of anime I hate WAY more than Sekirei! Still, I would avoid this one unless you really want to see some mindless entertainment featuring impossibly busty Pokemon women fighting each other for the sake of a highly cliche' and contrived plot.\\n",

            "content": "I don't know why people ask me to review harem anime. Yes, I've found a few that I liked, but most of them are heavily misogynistic and treat the women like prizes to be won or vapid automatons that have been programmed to chase after this one very ordinary guy regardless of how he treats them or how obviously he rejects them. Who knows, maybe my general distaste for the genre makes people want reviews to see if their particular one will be one of the exceptions or maybe it's a case of people wanting to see me tear an anime a new one andthey figure a harem title has a good chance of filling that role. The series was created by the manga artist, Gokurakuin Sakurako or Sakura Ashika. An artist best known for her shounen ai. The anime adaptation was handled by Seven Arcs, the studio behind Inukami, which was bad and Mahou Shoujp Lyrical Nanoha, which was good. Let's take a look at Sekirei and see if it's one of those rare good harem anime or one of the many that isn't even remotely worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nOur story begins with a ronin named Minato who's just failed to get into University for the second year in a row. As he's walking down the street a girl, Musubi, falls on top of him. She's being chased by lightning hurling twins. She grabs Minato and runs. It turns out she's a Sekirei, a being with super powers that are fully activated by kissing an Ashikabi, which is the title for their masters. The idea is that a hundred and eight of these beings will fight until one is left to claim the ascension prize. The story from there primarily focuses on the various Sekirei that flock to Minato. Just about everything in the series is pretty typical for a harem series. The only real exception is the powered being battle which, as the only potentially interesting element, is pushed into the background. Plus, the execution for what they do have of it is crap. Get this, one of the rules is that Ashikabi are forbidden to mention the Sekirei plan to outsiders, and yet you see the Sekirei fight out in the open where anyone can see them by walking by, opening a window installing a security camera or through various other means. And yet this is supposed to be a secret. That goes past Twilight and to All Star Batman and Robin levels of stupidity. The humour is another element that fails. Sekirei does have an occasional funny joke, but you can count them on the fingers of one hand, assuming a normal number of fingers. The ending is absolute rubbish. They set up for a sequel while having a pandering, arbitrary triumphant moment. The worst aspect of the work as a whole is the absolutely vile treatment of the female characters. They're quite strongly objectified right down to having masters who can, quite literally, claim them whether they like it or not. This is probably the best example of internalised misogyny I've ever seen. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are about as nuanced and developed as tissue paper. They're fully typical for what you almost always see in bad harem anime. You have the ordinary protagonist with no special attributes who you're supposed to root for because he's a generically \"good\" character. The perky and air-headed girl. The more aggressive girl. The loli (ewww) and so on. You will never find a real woman who acts like any of these characters, but they're designed to appeal to incredibly shallow and hormonal men so... mission accomplished?\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork in this could be generic, but there are several factors that bring it down. The first, and most obvious, being the absurd fan-service. Expect a lot of random panty, ass and breast shots. The fight scenes would be good, but they have the same problem as the action sequences in Highschool of the Dead and Ichiban Ushiro no Daimou, they like to break up the action with fan-service scenes and use the fight scenes as a flimsy excuse to strip the protagonists. Sekirei, stop being stupid. No one is going to do that in a fight. You're going to aim for causing injuries, not ripping someone's clothes. The only way you're going to go for someone's clothes in an actual fight is if they've got loose bits that you can use to pull the person to the ground or to hinder their mobility. The backgrounds are largely dull too. \\n\\n\r\nDon't expect great vocal performances in this. It's almost certainly a case of dull, uninspired characters having voice actors who are good, but can't add depth where the script calls for none. And the problem certainly isn't the actors. You've got Hayami Saori (who was good in both Ano Hana and Sasameki Koto), Inoue Marina (who was good in Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight and Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha Strikers) but if I give examples of good performances for every voice actor this'll be exceedingly long. The point to take away from this little exercise is that the actors are capable, their performances in this are just bad. The music is the best part of the series. It isn't good, it isn't even mediocre, but it's not bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is a 4/10. There are some decidedly yuri moments in this. \\n\\n\r\nSekirei is terrible. The story is largely typical harem schlock and the atypical element has been done by several, vastly superior anime. The characters are a joke, the treatment of the female characters as objects to be collected is appalling. The sheer idiocy of several of the elements is headache inducing and the fan-service is just ridiculous. I will give it some credit for it's few funny moments and occasional good action sequence, but they certainly aren't worth sitting through the rest of the series to get to. Final rating 2/10. I just hope the next thing on my review request queue is better. Let me see... Sekirei: Pure Engagement. Insert as many expletives here as you like, it probably won't be enough. I'm going to take a couple hours to read Gail Simone before moving on to that, but expect the review next week.",

            "content": "Can you believe what they're doing with the pokemon franchise these days? I mean I know the games are getting stale but jeez Nintendo, I didn't think they would go down the fanservice road by turning the pokemon into big boobie bouncing girls that blindly follow their masters... Oh, hold on, this isn't pokemon, it's just another generic harem ecchi show.\r\nSTORY: College drop out boy meets a cute boobilicious girl and proceeds to move into a dorm with other girls of different shapes and sizes, and also begins his quest after catching his first Sekirei to become a master or something... Okay that's all Igot, the \"Oh it's exactly like those other things\" joke are lazy tiresome and a bit repetitive, but anime like this is exactly what it should only get and deserve.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Sekirei is absolutely nothing different from any ecchi anime you'll see, lazy characterizations? Check! Clueless and borderline retarded female lead? Check! Female lead devoting herself to the main male lead for, no joking about this here, no reason at all and despite they only just met? You know it...\\n\r\nBut, the gimmick this time to get you interested in the tittie show is this is like pokemon, as the Sekirei practiably act like mindless tools for battle and follow their master's demands as this ecchi anime is also a generic action anime, you know, the kind that only clothes take damage (There clothes should only be treated as a health bar before they \"faint\" apparently). Not that it's a terrible idea or anything, but there is an obvious marketing underside to the idea, as the girl just love to repeat what type of Sekirei they are. I'm the fighting type! I'm the fire type! etc, etc...\\n\\n\r\nThe girls range from all kinds of sizes, you got you perfect woman build, the ridiculous proportioned ones, and even a loli so no pervert is left out, as there's enough for all. As character's go... The main lead is too generic to even care about, even his name escapes me (I know I can just look it up on wiki or something but why should I if generic hero of ecchi anime is a more suitable name?)  and the lead female or pokemon-Sekirei whatever has the IQ of half her breast size in centimeters, so there's no dodging the \"oops, I saw your panties\" jokes or \"OMG, you're naked!\" routines, even we get full frontial boobs in this one, but just like any other ecchi, is nothing more than cock teasing to point of saying, \"Why isn't this just a hentai?\"\\n\\n\r\nAll Sekirei manages to do is kill brain cells and empty wallets, well until the next tit anime comes along, and if you're the type to fall for it, then more power to you, because it least you're fueling one of the bigger budget anime producers, Aniplex, and maybe they'll use the money to make more Fate/whatevers or other colored Exorcists so that they can market something not as completely bland as this.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: At least... The animation is fine, action scenes are good and the titties are... well, bouncing, so that's all that should matter anyway for anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: I can't remember, it's forgettable to the point of amnesia. Didn't watch the japanese version as much as the english version, and I did check out Funimation's dub and it's underwhelming, but even Funimation knew that the effort of a good dub would be unfitting for this anime. Chuck Huber is in it as a type-casted professor so at least that's kind of a treat.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\n+ If you're in it for titties, more power to ya.\\n\r\n+ Don't worry, they're animated quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nMixed:\\n\r\n+/- A decent idea / A gimmick used for easier marketing.\\n\\n\r\nThe Bad:\\n\r\n- About as deep as every generic harem you've ever seen.\\n\r\n- No memorable character, retard main female lead.\\n\r\n- Forgettable audio, both english and japanese audio are just as lazy.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not trying to talk shit here, and I know I didn't really give this anime a chance (Though I can get enough information from watching two episodes to write a review speaks volumes of how truly little there is offered in this anime in terms of everything but titties) and of course it's only about the titties and it's redundant to criticize the show for it, but this is almost insulting, but if you really want to watch this, try watching it with a few friends and have a blast cracking pokemon references or even do your own Mystery Science Theater 3000 commentary with this show, that's probably the best way to get through this the non-shameless way instead of beating off to this.",

            "content": "Sekirei starts out with your typical pathetic male---couldn't get into college, no close friends, no girlfriend, or any hope at all for anything good to happen in the near future l...until that one fateful day. :P\r\nStory - Pretty generic, yet unique at the same time if that makes any sense whatsoever. Like I said, you've got your typical \"down in the dumps\" male, Minato, who feels like all is lost after not making it into college, but then he meets this girl who instantly connects with him. The girl turns out to be what is called a Sekirei and now Minato is involved in agame known as the Sekirei Plan. 108 Sekirei have been let loose throughout the city, each looking for someone they adore (technical term 'Ashikabi&quot;). After most of them have found their Ashikabi, the game sets into a new development which will cause all of the Sekirei to battle with the winner receiving a prize. That prize is that the Sekirei will be able to live with their Ashikabi forever. However, judging from how the series is going, it doesn't look like we'll see any of that Sekirei Plan game in action this season (assuming they make a second season). Anyway, the good part about the story is the fact that each Ashikabi isn't limited to one Sekirei, so it'll obviously lead to some funny moments when the Sekirei fight over their Ashikabi. However, sometimes I wish that the main character, Minato, would show a little more affection as to the Sekirei he likes instead of trying to treat them all equally. =/ \\n\\n\r\nArt &amp; Sound - The artwork isn't bad, but the females are all generally the same with a few exceptions...big breasted with long hair (with the exception being their personalities). :P The sound isn't bad either, although the OP and ED songs aren't particularly the greatest out there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Well, you're bound to like someone from the show since all of the Sekirei have a unique personality. There are a lot to choose from which would make anyone enjoy the show somewhat. The development could have gone a bit smoother, if you could even pick out any development in the series, but it isn't that bad. Having a favorite character will definitely increase the chance of enjoying the show. :P\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Well, I really like it for some odd reason. I have my favorite Sekirei (Tsukiumi), pairings I like better than others, as well as the anticipation to see what will happen next. It really comes down to if you like Ecchi, Harem, Romance series if you ask me. The action part of the show is practically a bonus for me. With that said, I, personally, really enjoy Sekirei. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Sekirei is an interesting anime that will hopefully have a second season to touch base on the actual storyline of the Sekirei Plan.",

            "content": "Important: Forgive my english please. As a french person it's not very easy for me.\r\nWow!! I'm surprise. I'm not a \"harem with overload of fanservice\" fan, having be introduce to a lot of crappy show in that context by friends *cough*rosario-vampire*cough**cough*to-love-Ru*cough*. I watch this anime cauze I heard a lot of good comment about it. So here's my review...\r\nStory: You have twelve episodes to tell a good serie and sekirei had done this part almost perfectly. Cauze in that kind of show, usually, you don't have a big original story. The stories are classic being concentrated to provide what I call \"overload of fanservice inevery aspect\"( if you understand what I mean by \"aspect\"). This show broke a little bit of those rules by adding a story who has some good moment. Despite the fact that almost every character has oversized-boobs, the fanservice is everywhere, but they don't exagerated things, witch I think was the good move to made. Sure, there's always people who will complain about being a stupid show and I respectfully disagree. I'll explain later in the other segement. \\n\r\nStory: 8/10 for providing a \"descent\" story for a twelve episodes show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Amazing. The character are really well draw and animeted. I think there's some character art that are very original and beautiful. I'm not gonna go so far in the art, cauze I'm not very good to explain every single good things about it. \\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Here's where I'm feeling more ngh. The music is typically not so good in those shows at least in my opinion, but I can undersand the choice of music and the opening doesn't scare the crap out of me *cough*to-love-Ru second opening*cough*. \\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Wow!! Once again, twelve episode show. I didn't expect to have huge character developpement in that kind of context, but at least some characters had there own personnality and you can understand almost everybody why there doing this and that. Minato never became annoying like I don't know...heu...*cough*Aono Tsukune*cough*. Musubi was a hot-blooded character witch I think was funny and a good move to put that. Tsukiumi was my favorite character ( and no, it's not because of her huge breast). I think she had the classic \"I don't need those inferior person\" syndrome and finally she need her Ashikabi more than everyone else, but the way it's handle is perfect and at that time, this can became annoying and it never does. \\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement: God what's wrong with me!! I ENJOY THE SHOW!! Me, mecha-fan, there's must be something wrong in my mind. Verification: I still love Gundam, yes or no... yes...ouf... No seriously, I think it's an awesome ride and... well that's it... nothing more, nothing less, \"ENJOYABLE\"!! Enjoyement: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I'm gonna remember that show for a long time. Because I'm someone who search for spectacular story with something we never saw before, and the show has some flaws (like every show does) I can't give more than eight, but if your a \"harem\" fan or someone who simply love anime in general, take a detour on that show, it's worth watching and not necessarily very long.\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10",

Almost all of the girls in the show have giant boobs that hang out or show major cleavage. Also they almost all have really short skirts that show panties in action scenes, or panties flash out of the blue. The male main character gets alot of attention from his Sekirei(really hot girls) that make this hot too. The thing that I think makes Sekirei awesome, though is that unlike most ecchi anime, it actuall has an awesome plot and it has awesome action and fighting. Each girlin the show has a different power that makes the story line kick ass. Examples are controlling water, plants, wind, or just having super strength.",

I started watching it just thinking it was going to be a pure fanservice show with a bad story (Like Queen's Blade lol) but instead I got a very enjoyable adventure. This is my first review here so I'll break each section down.\r\nStory (8)\r\nI was expecting poor plot but instead I got a story that actually really managed to get me involved. Sekirei are basically superpowered chicks and a couple of pretty boys. They select a human to form a bond with in order to bring out their full power. These humans are called Ashikabi's and for the most part seemto be clueless guys lol. The main idea is that there's a tournament that all 108 of the Sekirei will be competing in. The winner will get to stay with their Ashikabi forever. It seems simple enough but a lot of things happen that spice the story up.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7)\\n\r\nI have mixed feelings about the art because it tends to change from time to time. Some scenes look excellent while others look like they're from a diffrent show. This doesn't happen enough to make me dislike the art though.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6)\\n\r\nI'm fairly neutural when it comes to the sound. The voice acting is pretty good but the music's a bit feminine for my taste. There's nothing really wrong with that, I just wish there was more kick ass action songs lmao.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (9)\\n\r\nThis is where Sekirei really shines. The characters are all unique and it's practically impossible to not find someone you like. The only reason I don't give the characters a perfect score is because Minato and Musubi are the least interesting of all. That could be a problem for some people since they're the main characters. On the other hand others tend to like them so it's all a matter of opinion. Tsukiumi's my favorite because I love her attitude and her powers.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8)\\n\r\nIt's a very amusing show. Anyone with a sense of humour will be laughing every other minute as they watch this. The action scenes are also relaly good for the most part. I just wish they had fleshed out some of the background characters a little bit more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8)\\n\r\nAnyone who doesn't like fanservice should beware because there's plenty. It is one of the better one's however because they actually work the fanservice into the plot. All in all Sekirei's a solid anime that I'll probably end up buying on dvd.",

It's like any other you've watched (for instance Tenjou Tenge, Ikkitousen) but this one has a more \"pokemon-cath 'em style\" theme if you know what I mean. I will include full descriptions in this review because I feel that even if I spoil the story or other stuff you will enjoy this anime not because of the story specifically. Also this anime has, halfway through, explicit content, specifically: nudity. So it's not suitable for underage audiences. \r\nThe story is prettymuch straight forward as for any of this echi animes. You know: a somewhat failure type of guy is deppressed all over something and then when he is walking home he get's to meet a really beautiful girl that cames out of nowhere and just after that the girl, for whatever reason, get's to stay in the guy's house\". The twist is that this girl is one of the \"Sekireis\" that the worldwide famous MBI company has let out to provoke a \"Battle Royale\" scenario between the sekireis in the city called \"New Tokyo\". Now this girls have a wide range of super powers (water, fire, psychical, etc.) and fight in order to get their wish of being with the person they love forever come true. \\n\\n\r\nThis girls need to \"be winged\" in order to be able to use their full power, they do this by mixing their DNA with a human's DNA: by kissing. Now the story is set just in a like 10 year gap from the present (2019 or something like that). So most of the stuff you see on the enviroment is as just realistic as watching it anywhere else for real. Another thing that I did found different in this anime compared with others of this genre (le's take Ikkitousen and Tenjou Tenge) is the reason behind the fights. In Ikkitousen they just fight to \"fullfill the destiny of the magatama\" in \"Tenjou Tenge there is really no reason at all xD! Here you've got better and realistic event that causes the fighting to begin.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a Seven Arcs artistic produccion so it's obviously very good. The design  of the backgrounds and specially the characters is superb. The characters are very nice to watch in action and the animation doesn't miss almost any amount of detail in fight sequences. The space of action get's it's great dose of originality as well. The locations are often destroyed nicely and when that happens it's does looks realistic and it does leave a chaotic-satisfactory feeling. Another thing this anime has to deal with is the fan service issue. Yes this anime shows almost all sekireis as big breasted babes, of course there are exceptions but that is the main idea. This babes are vey teasing and seductive from time to time, so expect some hardcore echi escenes.  But even so respecting looks every single one of the characters is different from one another by some characteristic features, even so the overall body type is the same. The characters are drawn so well that you see that they are completely different in some way or another.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't got much to say about to say about the sound. The opening and ending themes are a bit gilrlish, but then again it all comes down if they fit the theme or not, well.. at the end they do. Voice acting is a important factor in an anime too. Well in here the voice acting is superb: love Tsukiumi's voice (love everything about her really) and Karasuba's as well (lol the voice talent is the same as Hitsugaya Toushirou and Elric Edward). The sound is nice and complements this anime making it a great listening experience.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters are amazing and have very different behaviors. I'm in love with the beautiful blond, short-tempered and violent Tsukiumi, I fancy the peaceful, determined and voluptuous Musubi and definitely want the perverted, seductive and smart Matsu. Even the secondary characters or just those that only appear in one or two episodes have a great amount of detail respecting looks and personality so you'll be willing to see more of those characters even if they don't show up anymore on the storyline. You will definitely feel symphaty for the vast majority of the cast and even get attached to them.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is something perfect about this anime, leaving aside the artistic design, I've got to say that the enjoyment impact that acomplishes on the viewer is somewhat different from another aspects this anime offers. The enjoyment factor is high quality and I don't know about other people but I'm really anxious and looking forward for the OVA and the second season. Why? Well because I did greatly enjoy it. If you are not a echi fan and are only used to watch animes with elaborate stories and difficult scripts then definitely this one is not for you, as you will see the story as lame and with no sense at all. But if you're looking for fun, great, sexy looking characters and no great complications in storyline issues then this is one anime you should seriously considering watching.\\n",

            "content": "Where to begin...\r\nThis is obviously a ecchi fanservice harem anime. That much is glaringly self-evident. I have no problem with that genre, honest, but this anime was not for me. I dropped it after seeing more than half of it, but I know the rest of the plot by reading spoilers.\r\nI noticed that a reviewer named \"Chasekun\" compared Sekirei to Fate/stay night. All I have to say in response to that is...\r\n \"Are you nuts?! Have you actually SEEN Fate/stay night before, Chasekun?!\" \r\nThe two couldn't be more different. While, yes, there is a very superficial similarity in the \"Masters/Ashikabi with Servants/Sekirei\" dynamic and thatthere is fighting between Servants/Sekirei. But that's it. Fate/stay night is far, far deeper and much more thought-provoking, especially the original visual novel\u2014 the anime adaptation is quite lackluster in comparison to the VN, but even the anime of Fate/stay night has much more substance to it than Sekirei. Interesting and well-developed characters and actual character development, dynamic plot (the VN actually has three different routes/stories each with multiple paths), actually well-thought-out mechanics for things like magic (this reviewer thinks so, anyways), etc.; I could go on but that isn't the point of this review. \\n\\n\r\nSekirei, on the other hand...\\n\\n\r\nStory: Poor. There's not really much of a story here when you look past the feeble attempts at establishing a plot. It's pretty much exactly what is written (or rather, drawn) on the box. As I'm sure you've read in other reviews, it's basically an excuse to have 100+ super-powered chicks duke it out\u2014oh, two or three of the Sekirei are bishounen instead. The story is written to basically allow for the premise of \"big titty aliens with superpowers in a battle harem, inexplicably having fallen in love with a completely unremarkable spineless loser (lol, only in anime can this happen), beating the crap out of other big titty aliens with superpowers for an arbitrary reason\". That may seem harsh, but it's literally what the story is when you sift through all the padding put in place to make it seem like there is actually something there.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Mediocre. I'm kind of spoiled by series with far better artwork now, though, so I'm not impressed, can't help that. Also, I tend to like more realism in character designs, rather than the style of \"impossibly wide hips, huge butts, and massive boobs\". Also, there is something about their faces that just feels wrong to me... I think it's the eyes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fair. Nothing groundbreaking or amazing. Voices are decent, at least in the Japanese version (I'm not sure if there is a dubbed version of this yet, nor am I really inclined to find out). Essentially, nothing I didn't already expect, but that isn't a bad thing, exactly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Poor. Characters are pretty much static cliches meant to be the carriers of tropes commonly seen in harem anime. Let's see... the main male character is more of a pathetic weenie than Keitaro of Love Hina, and not even nearly as noticeable or amusing as him; he's just sort of... there. Main female character is... hmm, \"empty headed\" is the best way to describe her; she's one of those vapid \"I don't have 'common sense' so I sound like a moron when I ask questions about things that should be self-evident to any normal person\" types. After her we have a scary onee-san landlady (probably one of the most interesting characters in the story), psuedo-playboy but not really bishounen Sekirei, amiable tomboy lesbian sekirei (also one of the most interesting characters, and not because she's lesbian, mind you), lazy pervert bum guy and his twin tsundere lightning sekirei, token loli sekirei, lecherous old man type big titty hacker sekirei, possessive violent tsundere sekirei, sensual stripper older woman bottle fairy sekirei, bloodthirsty insane sword sekirei, main character's weird perverted somewhat domineering little sister and her shota dark-is-not-evil sekirei, his domineering smoker researcher mom, batshit crazy mega-corporation head, and many more largely irrelevant characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Poor. Personally, I prefer stories that are actually substantial and not a flimsy cover for a ecchi fanservice harem situation. I like stories where the characters are actually modeled like real people with dynamic moods and personalities, and not essentially one-dimensional harem tropes designed for the sole purpose of ecchi comedy. I like stories that engage me intellectually and make me think, not mindless perversion barely hidden behind a cobbled-together plot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Decent, actually. While I didn't finish it, I didn't exactly hate it. I didn't like it either. In the end, it does what it set out to do\u2014provide ecchi comedy\u2014pretty well. However, I'm not exactly interested in something lacking this much substance, since I'm a thinking type of guy. Basically? If you want to just sit back, veg, and watch something ecchi that doesn't require much thought and has lots of girls with big tits and butts? Sekirei is for you. If you want to watch something that actually requires you to pay attention to the story because it has an involved plot, with developed characters? Try something like Fate/stay night (especially the original visual novel, it's a fantastic read) instead.",

            "content": "Sekirei has a very obvious harem premise, so caution is required by those who usually dislike this type of anime: 108 creatures, mostly female, spread all over town are to be either willingly or unwillingly \"winged\" by human masters through the exchange of bodily fluids, most commonly through a kiss, and engage in a battle royale to decide which pair will win and \"ascend together unto heaven\".\r\nStory:\r\nThe plot is linear and simple, a few mysteries are contained as to the identities and motivations of some characters, as well as the true nature of the Sekirei Plan. An interesting aspect of it is the high degreeof faithfulness to the manga it's derived from, to the point of the viewer, by the end of the series, be able to pick up the subsequent manga volume and read it without major issues.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art doesn't manage to impress, but the quality is very consistent throughout, and it's very hard to perceive poorly made moments due to low budget. The battle animations and choreography are, however, better than one would expect from a series of this scope, and it also gives fans who come in from the manga interesting details on each Sekirei's powers.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe intro and outro songs fit the mood of the content, the background music is good but not outstanding. On the other hand, voice acting is a very catching aspect of it, with a couple higher profile actresses(namely Marina Inoue and Paku Romi, both usually typecast for bold female and young male roles). Since most of the comedy comes from the interaction of the main cast with itself, thiswas a central part of the production which was not overlooked.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nAs a typical harem series, most of the humor is derived from the eccentric and fixed personalities of the main characters, and most of the character development focuses on the protagonist, and is quite a small amount. Most of the Sekirei only change their reactions significantly shortly after and during the process of being winged, and remain unchanged after that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nSekirei is a good series, with a sufficiently fast pace that will keep most people hooked. It's leaving a lot of fans with hopes for future seasons, even though I personally find the possibility to be unlikely. It offers a small twist to the harem genre having the combat aspects and multiple masters with small harems of their own, and has been likened to Pokemon by many. In the end, a fitting work for it's short run of 12 episodes.",

            "content": "Sekirei is actually a pretty generic show in terms of plot, characters, story, and art.  The ecchi and harem aspect can immediately put people off.  With those things in mind, this is by far one of my most favorite hidden gems in anime that i've found.\r\nb-b-b-but you gave its a 7??  Yes i did, that's b/c the anime isn't finished; there are two seasons and many rumors about a third.  This is also the first anime that has made me pick up the manga.  If the story were complete, or at least if there were more episodes, this would geta 9 from me.\\n\\n\r\nSekirei is about a game played in a large metropolitan city with humanoids (mainly females) having strange abilities that go around battling one another trying to find an ashkabi (mainly male) for them to latch onto and battle for/protect.  Its like a giant battle royal with wild fight scenes and an enormous depth of back story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Sekirei unique is how well its executed, the characters, while largely generic fit perfectly with the setting and context of the game, and there are many different types of characters that surround the MC, alot of them are very powerful.  It makes for an exciting dynamic.  The anime is almost a SoL though, as it doesn't really take off into crazy town until the second season, but i found that it kept me wanting more and more and more.  After each episode the show just got better and better.  the progression was almost perfect.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some drawbacks however, namely the MC is a pussy.  What makes this even slightly tolerable is that there is a very slow progression to his character and while he is often aloof, naive, shy and stuttering, he isn't a sniveling, groveling weakling that just makes you hate his guts.  \\n\\n\r\nThere's also a fair amount of ecchi with tits and red faces popping up in almost every episode.  It isn't Highschool DxD level, but there's no doubt they are catering to the fanservice crowd.  Thankfully it doesn't really get in the way, as most of the fanservice scenes serve multiple purposes to further the character development or the plot.\\n\\n\r\nEven with the individual elements being somewhat generic, the way their are positioned makes the show particularly unique and especially interesting.  I've watched my fair share of animu, this is one of those shows that really grabbed my attention from the start and never let me down.  And generic works to make the characters relate-able and interesting early and b/c of this its very easy for them to break their mold and surprise the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nIf you can handle some ecchi and are looking to be thoroughly entertained, can't do much better than Sekirei, it has a little bit of everything without being overbearing.",

            "content": "Sekirei is considered by many to be an underrated gem of its genre. It is definitely a classic harem anime in the sense that we know the main character is not going to pick any of the girls due to his demeanor and the circumstances surrounding the plot. I personally dropped this anime after episode 3 the first time I attempted to watch it. However, after a couple months, I came back to it and it has grown on me, very much so.\r\nFor as infamous as this show is for it's very frequent nudity, big-breasted sex-appeal women, and emphasis on Ecchi, Seikirei does actually havea very fascinating plot and setting which balances out its constant innuendos. The Sekirei concept in itself feels much like a mixture of Pok\u00e9mon, The Hunger Games, and The Running Man all weaved into one (with a lot of drama and \"slice of life\" atmosphere thrown in). The plot has a fair amount of good action and enough of an actual story line of depth to yank it from the category of an anime that is \"just being an Ecchi for ecchi's sake\" but not enough to make it more about the story either. So it balances itself quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot and concept/constructs of the story are nicely thought out and explained adequately as the story unfolds (at some point, a confusion you may be having will always be addressed). The whole concept of the Sekireis, Ashikabis, the Disciplinary Squad, and government structure of the Sekirei project offer a depth that matches many \"fair\" anime adventure series (I say \"fair\" because the plot is well-done/laid out, but also isn't flat-out amazing either).\\n\\n\r\nMinato Sahashi, the male lead and protagonist, in my opinion, is the show's weakest point. Much like Yusuke Takasaki from the infamous anime: Green Green (but not AS bad), he is a very tasteless character that kind of just has to be there for the plot's sake and structure.  By season 2, he grows a small bit and I probably accepted him more than in the first season due to the simple factor of time.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sekirei, for the most part, are what make this anime interesting. Their personality differences as well as their constant fighting to be Minato's one love, is highly comical and at times, super sweet (when they get a moment to themselves with him).\\n\\n\r\nFor me personally, Musubi and Tsukiumi are my favorite players in this anime drama. They both have very much potential (in my personal opinion) as showing quality traits of girls I personally would love to marry (Musubi more than Tsukiumi). This aspect is definitely one of the more core reasons I like this anime. The loyalty and dedication of Minato's Sekirei to their Ashikabi, is quite beautiful and romantic/\"wifely\" if you let it be.  Attaching to a character will definitely help you ride out the entire show MUCH better.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are nothing to write home about but are good enough that they don't distract from the characters and plot at hand.  The opening theme to both seasons of the show are very well-done in terms of music.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, a statement I once heard vulgarly put to describe this show was: \"it's like Pok\u00e9mon, except with big-titted women.\" Though that statement in the raw sense is true, yes....the show is definitely more than that. It isn't a flat-out amazing show, but most of the characters are quite interesting and you can definitely get attached to them. Overall: Good plot/setting/story, funny comedy, mostly all likable characters (a few I can't stand), very well-done opening theme song, and exciting super powered action when it's around. Sekirei is definitely a decent anime for the genre-mix it is trying to be.\\n\\n\r\n(Warning: Season 2 ends on a \"to be continued\" cliff-hanger and Season 3 will probably never be created/released to conclude the story, due to a few reasons you can research yourself. With this in mind, just realize that you won't get closure if you decide to get into this anime.)",

            "content": "Review #5: Sekirei\r\nStory 7/10 -- The Story is semi unique I suppose to most action harems. 108 Girls with a variety of skills and martial arts descend onto the city, not only to find each other, but to find compatible masters in which there are many. I think what makes season 1 a good story is that they make the action intense in a series that is life and death for these girls. However I felt that Minato and other masters roles are fairly underused, and the point of this battle royale seems underwhelming by the enemies claims. The dialogue was decent, but I preferthe plot and events of season 2.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10 -- Seven Arcs actually hasn't done many works, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha is what they are mainly known for, and there last anime series that drew any major attention was Trinity Seven back in 2014. I liked the design of the characters, and the contrast gave a good manga feel. The lighting was nice in some scenes, however some other scenes lost a bit of quality in the moment. The fight scenes overall were executed standard, but nothing above average.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10 -- If you don't know the cast that went into this show, you are missing out in the sound department. The OP and ED were pretty good, with several known voice actors voicing characters in this series. However, the dialogue again was very plain, and underwhelming for the talent they had.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10 -- Oh Man, how many harem animes are there where every girl says the main characters name in one scene. While Minatos dream is the type you wanna root for, you can't help but wish another team was lurking in the background with a better set of motivation. This harem lacked depth in it's characters, mainly because of the lack of any change throughout the show. Seemed like the enemy was revealed more then our protagonists, and the lack of development just killed this show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10 -- This show is fairly enjoyable if you like ecchi, action, and next level fighting. I think the concept of a harem battle royale sounds interesting, but like every other anime, the production has to have consistent quality throughout the series to keep it interesting. Some scenes were better then others, and I still prefer the arcs in the next season. There's also some appeal in rooting for the underdog, as I find his wish to be respectful of everyone fighting, and it actually sounds possible.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10 -- The characters make and break this show. You will either like it or you won't. Personally I thought the concept overall had lots of potential, and the cast also looked very good. The story was fairly decent, but I didn't like the limited dialogue or the lack of character development, and that makes me drop the score from a seven to six.\\n\\n\r\n~Castawayz",

            "content": "After seeing how so many people gave this a really high rating, I had to review.\r\nFirst off, this show is one of the worst anime series I have ever seen (the other being Upotte!). \r\nStory: The story is extremely lame, seeing as it is about a student who cannot get into college who cannot do anything at all (how original). One day, as he is walking through the city, a random girl just happens to land on him in midst of a battle. Thus, the start of a weird \"adventure.\" One by one, he meets more of these weird girls that become known as Sekirei.Sekirei are forced to fight the other Sekirei in order to prevail victorious in order to spend all of eternity with their Ashikabi, or their loved one.  However, the only thing that really happened was Minato randomly running into new girls, \"conquering\" them, and thats pretty much it. If you only want to see boobs and other ecchi stuff, I would say shoot for Sekirei. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in my opinion was a little annoying. I hated seeing the character designs as something just didnt feel right about them. Normally, a harem anime (in my opinion) should have at least cute girls in them. The poor designs were just a major pain to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Although the voice cast was good, I absolutely couldn't stand Minato's voice both in Japanese and the Dubbed version. He sounded so nasaly and useless that it made me want to bang my head on the keyboard repeatedly. The rest of the people sounded very exhausted and not very enthusiastic about the characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: It's something we have seen in almost every harem genre: a useless male lead with many supposedly cute girls fall for him for either his kindness or just random reason. In this case, they love him for his kindness (i think). Each Sekirei have their own ability/ power, such as controlling plants or water. \\n\\n\r\nI remember when I was watching this, I wondered why I was making myself go through that kind of torture. I literally thought before an episode, \"When will this be over?\" or \"Will i make it through this episode?\" \\n\\n",

Prepare for \"oops, my clothes ripped!\" Scenes as well as \"the wind has conveniently moved my skirt up and I'm not wearing shorts!\" Prepare for a lot of underwear and boobs. Lots and lots of boobs. (OPPAI! XD)\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nNow, if you don't focus on the random boobs and underwear popping up everywhere, this anime has a pretty good plot. So, this guy named Minato Sahashi is walking down the sidewalk when a big-boobed girl falls from the sky and lands on him! (This panty-shot is provided to youin part by OPPAI and co.) She is fighting these two twins, also big boobed, with these random lighting bolts. She takes him to an alleyway and kisses him, making her a lot stronger. Later, she tells him that she is a Sekirei, basically an alien with superpowers, who have been put into the city to fight each other. There are many other Sekirei in the city including Musubi (big boobs and \"I don't really care if I'm half-naked\" girl) and the twins.\\n\r\nThat was just a basic premise. It's actually pretty interesting if you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art's pretty good, it has cool fight scenes and a lot of boob physics.

            "content": "Anime: Sekirei\r\nTitle: Meh..... That is all.\r\nAbout the Anime: Minato Sahashi was living a normal life; he had just failed his college entrance exam for a second year in a row, and lived a quiet life in a single's apartment. That is, until the busty Musubi fell from the sky on top of him! She is a Sekirei, one of 108 that are destined to fight each other until only one remains; and he or she will ascend to heaven with his or her chosen one known as an Ashikabi. Minato soon finds himself in the embrace of Musubi, becoming her Ashibaki - but his lifewill only become more complicated. Musubi isn't the last to claim Minato as her Ashibaki, and what's worse, plenty of other Sekirei and opponents stand in his way!\\n\\n\r\nStory 4.5/10: If I had to choose a moniker for Sekirei, it would probably be, \"The Little Anime that Couldn't\". It offers ecchi fan-service without being racy, peddles action while failing to be engaging, and sports an interesting setup that the show never puts to effective use. While it's possible to read the series as making fun of itself, the harem genre, and tournament-focused shounen shows, a second look reveals that the show means everything it says--much to my dismay.\\n\r\nA quick summary of the series reads like Pokemon, but with tits. The first installment follows the hapless protagonist as he bumbles and sweet talks his way into acquiring of an increasingly powerful and scantily-clad team of humanoid aliens called Sekirei in preparation for a tournament sometime in the near future (read: second season). Thankfully, the parade of buxom woman in various states of undress meshes well with the show's simplistic focus on escalating confrontations. When two Sekirei meet for the first time, they fight. When Minato encounters new potential teammate, there's a fight. When MBI (the evil corporation behind the whole thing) seals off Neo Tokyo, the gang finds an excuse to fight. These high-energy smackdowns, which increase in frequency, participants, and outrageous displays of power as the story progresses, take a good deal of the pressure off the flagging narrative.\\n\r\nThe show does demonstrate on occasion that there might be a decent yarn hiding behind all the cheesecake, but then refuses to follow up on any of these more interesting tidbits. For example, the first episode introduces the Sekireis' extra-terrestrial origins, but the subject gets dropped once MBI enters the picture. The dealings between Ashikabis (this world's trainers) also receive cursory treatment due to the series' singular focus on Minato, squandering an opportunity to provide him some character depth by comparison; and glossing over subplots that could have held the viewers' interest between battles. In the Kuu-chan mini-arc, the presence of another girl-wrangler and his cohort add tension and conflict to what would have been a boring meet-and-greet. But where the anime could have used the greedy antagonist to draw out the hero's underlying character traits, the remainder of the series chooses to leave this antagonist as a shadowy figure.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 6/10: Sekirei's visuals sport modern coloring and finishing techniques, but lack the consistency of more polished anime. For every excellent water, fire, or lightning effect associated with the fighters' powers, there's a scene where the animation turns blocky or the characters look odd. Additionally, combat sequences cut a lot of corners; the chase scenes or jumping receive the lion's share of screen time that should have gone to the use of the Sekireis' impressive powers or dramatic hand-to-hand fighting. The show also hamstrings its own dramatic buildups by dropping into an unattractive deformed style during important interpersonal moments in a weak attempt to add levity where none is needed.\\n\r\nAdditionally, the artists spent their limited imaginations early in the design process, leading to a plethora of derivative cuties. The lead's harem consists of four over-developed beauties in each of the four normal hair colors (blonde, brunette, redhead, raven-haired) and an adorable loli-girl who barely talks. While one character's interesting kimono and another's attractive black dress certainly provide some good eye-candy, two of Minato's girlies basically wear bedsheets, and a third wears an equally-unimaginative purple frock. The remaining cast coughs up such original creations as an outfit cribbed from Kill Bill, a guy dressed up like Neo from The Matrix Reloaded, and a set of twins in matching two-piece zippered cat suits (use the non-furry definition of cat-suit). Since the characters' costumes don't reflect their powers, each design merely allows the viewer to tell Sekirei apart at a glance and nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10: Starting with the bland OP, the series' soundtrack does not disappoint, but also never surprises. Most of the incidental music follows in the grand synth tradition of middling anime, sounding familiar and hitting all of the \"right\" notes at the expected times. Accompanying an unapologetic fan-service slide show, the bubbly ED ends each episode on a sonic high note--assuming listeners ignore the coyly submissive lyrics (\"The truth is I want you to hold only me / I'm feeling turned on / Is it ok to show signs?\"). Sadly, the voice acting doesn't deviate from the standard set by the score. None of the characters miss their cues or offend the ears, but the readings add no nuance to the broadly drawn character stereotypes. The only memorable performance comes from Seki Toshihiko as the MBI Chairman; his over the top mannerisms and showman's shouts add much needed camp, but receive tragically little time in the limelight. Be warned, this series also includes a mewling youngster in the form of Kuu-chan. The little girl's cooing would have rapidly gotten annoying save for the fact that her seiyuu makes some entertaining non-speaking sounds.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10: Sekirei combines a stereotypical cast with pathetic characterization to fall flat on its face where it could have shined. Given the show's ecchi pedigree, a hollow male lead comes as no surprise, but where other shows provide an interesting harem to make up for a lackluster main protagonist, this series coughs up a laughably generic group for Minato. As the female lead, Musubi's naivete brings in a few good chuckles as she wrestles with modesty, but her eagerness to please and penchant for violence quickly grow stale when she does not develop at all during the first season. The rest of his Sekirei come straight out of central casting: Tsukiumi fell of the truck on the way from the tsundere factory, Kusano follows the textbook definition of imouto to a \"T\", and Kazehana presents like Shakugan no Shana's Margery Daw with all of the interesting parts removed (but all of her lady-parts intact). Furthermore, the series substitutes mystery in the place of complexity at every opportunity, purposefully obscuring characters' histories so that they can act in unpredictable ways. Luckily, the low episode count both provides a convenient excuse and mitigates the characters' lack of development and unoriginality.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10: Far from being painfully average, Sekirei entertains so long as it remains on the screen, but doesn't rise above the low bar it sets for itself. Watching the show for the first time, the viewer can applaud himself on recognizing moe archetypes and marvel at the nifty super powers on display, but the unoriginal premise and middling execution means the show hardly warrants a second viewing. Bouncing along like the chests of its female leads, this anime shoves to the side any and all plot threads that don't directly concern Minato and his coven of comely combatants. Straightjacketed by the supposed demands of its target demographic, the series remains unfailingly true to its setup and modest goals, and in so doing loses a shot at being something memorable.\\n\r\n~WhiteBakemono",

            "content": "Sekirei is pretty much your generic harem anime, but it does have its own ups. The anime is also a uncensored ecchi anime, not just stopping at ripped clothing but actually taking it to revealing nipples (gasp). The parts I really like is the well done artwork and soundtracks...sound in general.\r\nStory 8/10: Honestly, this is a really good rating for something you see almost everyday...a harem anime. If it wasn't done as well as this one, I'd probably would have dropped the anime and will not be writing this review. The anime takes the generic harem anime and added the creative Sekirei to it. Sekireiis a humanoid alien life form each specializing in combat (not so unique, right?). Here's the thing; the story actually explains where these girls and cuuute boys...well..boy came from. These Sekirei must find their \"fated\" Ashikabi (spoiler, not all of them meet their fated one, sad face) and then participate in a battle royale to decide the one that will remain with her/his Ashikabi. This is creative.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: If i was male, i'd be nosebleeding all over the place. This anime does it's artwork well. It is a fanservice ecchi anime, and it shows it with very \"sexy\" shots and angles at pretty ladies and even have a little something for the female watchers too (theres not much though). The combat scenes seems fluid and natural, with vibrant colors (well, as vibrant as you can get in mostly dark settings) and brilliant animation. I really liked the explosions and theres plenty in this anime. Everything down to the flames and cherry petals are well drawn and animated. I do complain about the insane breast size though...geez.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10: I love the sound system for Sekirei. The voice actors are well chosen...especially for Sahashi Minato. He actually sounds like the wimpy little -beep- that he is! On a more serious note, the soundtracks fits well with the animation and adds a little something to the anime. When a character is introduced, the soundtrack that plays really matches the personality of the character, and the combat music adds spice to the awesome action already there. I personally seeked out and downloaded them after i finished the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6.5/10 (5 and above and you round up): Excellent anime! And then we have character. We hate the word, dont we? My one big complaint about the anime; and from what i've seen, many others; is the wimpy main character. To be honest, i really dont see what he has going for him beside a \"kind\" if not suicidal personality. The worse thing is, he doesn't change either, throughout the season. The one thing that is boosting the score for character is the MC's sister, who act realistically and is very likable. Also, each other character in the supporting cast is explored quite well. (Spoiler: Seriously? Getting 100% right on a test that is made harder than the entrance exam effortlessly, and you screw it up when you take the real thing... theres a limit on how much being nervous can mess with your abilities, you know!)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: I love the anime. The fact the MC is a total idiot does dampen the enthusiasm a bit, but overall, it's a great anime. If you dont mind/like the ecchi and fanservice, you'll find the anime to be quite the attention grabber. It also has a high rewatch value, because the scenes and artwork are so well done. The action is a large part of the anime, and as long as you don't get tried of those, the anime is qite rewatchable. If the anime continues beyond Pure Engagement, I would love to continue watching.",

            "content": "While the concept for a good anime was here, it was very poorly implemented. It had a feel on paper as being like a harem-eske version of the Fate series in terms of battles taking place across an entire city landscape. However, the environment that was used was very limited, with the majority of everything happening at the plot characters central hub. \r\nAnother major problem was the characters themselves. While the main appeal of the characters was that they were all very clevagey (minus the little sister cliche), inevitably viewers want to learn more about the characters themselves. Because of the small episode count, itmakes sense that there wouldn't be a lot of time to learn about the characters in order to make way for the central plot. However, the majority of this anime takes place in the introduction stages, meaning that after all the main characters are introduced, the anime is halfway over, leaving absolutely no time for character development at all! Even during the episodes where there was growth to be made, it was simply written off and moved passed. And all of this time spent moving past important details led to one minor plot arc about characters who were never even introduced and you never really care about.\\n\\n\r\n This anime's biggest problem, however, was that it had so many plot holes. First of all, it is implemented that the powers of the characters can be increased, leaving an idea that a meaningful moment between the characters can change the tide of battle, allowing them to discover a new way to fight. This idea is used only by a minor character, and only like twice! Even when a fighting character did make progress that would seem to make the battle progress, the developments resulted in no change. Next of all their are all these different relationships going on that are hinted at but never used. There are characters that are introduced as possible villains to over come but are never actually met. And there is supposed to be some overrunning plot with the stories main villain, but is never elaborated on. The biggest kick to the groin is how the anime ends with a very unsatisfying conclusion that just brings up more questions rather than answers.\\n\\n\r\nIf your looking for an anime about women with huge chests fight, this anime for you.... I can't even say that it's even for those people either. Thats the only reason that this anime is getting a score at all. I'm a guy, I like that sort of thing. But I'm also an anime reviewer now, and this has more in common with a bad porn than an anime. I give this anime a 3/10. now i'm gonna go wash away my shame.",

This anime is just rediculous by all counts, but as long as you don't take it seriously, every episode is so much fun and has tons of ecchi to boot. I can't WAIT for season 2!\r\nThat's pretty much it. You can'treally review a story when there really isn't a decent one. haha!",

            "content": "This is definitely not for everyone. It's ecchi and harem all the way. It does have great comedy (mostly ecchi based) and it is a superpower/fighing anime as well. Unfortunately this is just the beginning of the manga, and it is adapted fairly well, but it ends just as the story is really getting started. It is a great introduction to the story for those that want to continue with the manga (the manga is still ongoing).\r\nThe main character is having trouble getting into university. He simply buckles under pressure when taking the entrance exams, though he shouldn't have any trouble passing. He bumps intoa girl on the street that gets him involved in quite a mess right from the start. She ends up becoming his first sekirei and his \"group\" grows from there. The anime covers the completion of his group of sekirei, but ends just as things get started.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of super powered fights between sekirei that are actually pretty well done. The main character is constantly shying away from his sekirei as they attempt to throw themselves at him every opportunity they get. He is a pretty stand up guy for the most part, and it's his sense of right and wrong that drive this story. It's not for everyone, but it is a pretty good series. If you can handle the genre's then definitely give this a try.",

            "content": "I am normally not a fan of harem animes because they typically leave the viewer without a conclusion. Sekirei was very unique to me because it presented a situation in which it was almost okay for the male MC to have a harem. Yes, most of the girls in his harem would have liked to have had him exclusively theirs, so those feelings remain. However, the status of all harem members is clear to all, and they're all better off for being in his harem--quite unique if you ask me.  \r\nBasically, this was one of the most acceptable harems I've ever seen, and wishthey would continue the series. The manga is even better. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the action scenes are pretty awesome, and the underlying plot was good. \\n\\n\r\nThe clincher for me was that this is a harem that seems to have actual elements of romance in it. The girls all are obvious about their feelings for him, but the male actually isn't a clueless, emotionally unavailable tsundere. He actually does show to each of them that he cares about them as individuals.  That's valuable to me in a harem anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe people who hate this anime simply confuse me. But then again, if you like typical harem animes, Sekirei isn't your typical harem. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Okay so I finished this series and I felt like I had to talk about it sense it was kind of an interesting concept in my opinion (not a new concept mind you but an interesting one). Yes this series is ecchi, yes it is comedy, yes it is romance, and yes it is fighting all which of which are pretty appealing aspects to guys out there.\r\nStory- Okay I couldn't have given this series a good review had I not been told there would be a second season. The reason why has a lot to do with the fact that very little was actually accomplishedduring the first season so much as it was set up i.e- suspense! but I'm getting ahead of myself. The story for this series is nothing new to people who have watched at least ten or twenty anime series in their time boy meets girl girl meets boy blah blah relationship builds blah blah harem scheme blah blah you get the idea, its something we've all seen before but yet are still willing to watch to see if they add some variation (which is one of the three keys to anime either being a success or being a big flop)\\n\r\nArt- I felt that this series was decently well drawn and pretty well animated the water looked amazing (okay not like OMG that looks like real freaking water amazing but wow that looks realistic amazing). Characters and actions other such things are drawn well (oversized boobs...apparently hard to animate but they got pretty close to what I think would be a realistic bounce just my opinion though). So art yeah good.\\n\r\nSound- Okay I looooved the voice acting in this series I loved how the character's voices matched and I mean really matched them so well, Minato's voice was by far the only one that actually bothered me. I loved the sounds sequence and sound effects so on this one a thumbs up.\\n\r\nCharacters- Okay yeah the cast of characters was pretty generic I mean I have seen all the character types before (snobby, brainy, loser, energetic, twins, loli, tough guy, psychopaths, villains, and perverts) but still you got love how each character's personality matched their body and voice type so well not to mention that each character tended to actually have some aspects that threw you for a surprise in the end (you'll know what I mean when you watch).\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Okay so I actually enjoyed this series I know for a fact I'll like the next season better because they'll be more story development but hey the first season is what it should be in my opinion (setting you up for the next season). One thing I did not enjoy was the censorship there is one episode that is uncensored (I will not say which so that way if you want to know you have to actually find and watch it hehe) even I'll admit I was slightly happy to see an uncensored episode; honestly they were just censoring it to piss somebody off (the couldn't you have just done that in the first place bell rang up when I actually saw the scene). On a second note though it made me a little sad when I saw it because one of favorite things about censorship is knowing that somewhere out there there is a guy just screaming \"SHOW ME THE BOOBIES ALREADY\" or letting out a disapointed sigh \"That censorship is a bitch\"at the screen.\\n\r\nOverall- I recommend this series to you 1 if you like comedy 2 if you don't mind a little mediocre generic action 3 you like ecchi. It's a good series and I'm expecting better things from the second season where I hope they will answer some of my unanswered question. Ciao!",

            "content": "I think in this day and age most are too quick to judge something because of its outward appearance. Often when the average fan comes upon a show where ecchi is front and center, most shrug it off as nothing more than a titsfest with nothing of value. But look at a classic like Tenchi Muyo, or the modern day classic Highschool DxD. While both are ecchi and contain harems often fighting for a single guy's attention, both have a lot more to offer with their unique plots and set-ups. Sekirei is no different.\r\nThe story itself was somewhat unique for its time, 108 Sekirei's areloosed into the city of Tokyo to find their Ashikabi so they may compete in the Sekirei Plan, where Sekirei fight Sekirei to become the last one standing. Sekirei are lifeforms that are like humans, but are given special powers like the ability to control water or lighting, extreme strength, or masterful skills with a sword. Ashikabi are their masters who can help give them power in a fight against another Sekirei.\\n\\n\r\nThis free for all battle style has become increasing popular since the airing of Sekirei, especially with the popularity spike in the Fate series. This kind of set up allows for serious stakes and suspense. As the Sekirei Plan progresses throughout the story, the walls begin to close in around the characters forcing more and more frequent combat. This tension really makes it compelling to watch. But at the center of the action, there is a very human story about relationships and loving ones close to you.\\n\\n\r\nMinato is the main character, who is pretty bland in all honesty. If it weren't for Joel McDonald's unique voice and great performance, he would be even more forgettable. This is rather unfortunate, as the series I mentioned in the first paragraph both have fairly memorable protagonists. Where the characters really shine in this series are the girls themselves. Musubi, Tsukiumi, Matsu, and little Kusano are where you'll find the majority of entertainment and comedy. Their designs are extremely attractive and personalities distinct albeit a bit cliche at times. Tsukiumi is the clear standout, with Lydia MacKay offering an outstanding performance using Shakespearean English in the place of the classic Japanese Tsukiumi uses in the Japanese version. Despite their massive differences, these four begin to develop a sisterhood that is fun to watch grow throughout the season. On the other side of the aisle with the villains, Minaka is a fun and often hilarious foil to our heroes. He is the Game Master, and wants nothing more than the Sekirei Plan to come to fruition. This makes the peril of the main cast nothing more than entertainment for him, which makes him deliciously fun.\\n\\n\r\nI loved the idea of Sekirei finding their Ashikabi. The author used the Red String of Fate trope to connect Sekirei and their Ashikabi. They are destined to find one another. But, the whole concept of Sekirei also helps legitimizes the harem itself. What I mean by that is Sekirei are completely ok with their Ashikabi having more than one Sekirei. Usually harems get messy and fall into the tired cliches of fighting over the guy and in the end only one girl gets him. This is a genuine breath of fresh air to those of us who love the harem genre. I think it's also one of the key hooks Sekirei has over other harem series.\\n\\n\r\nFor sound, the music is passable with a number of upbeat piano pieces, but the real draw is the outstanding English dub. Alexis Tipton, Lydia MacKay, Colleen Clinkenbeard, Monica Rial, Chuck Huber, and Joel McDonald all have terrific performances. Huber's wackiness and MacKay's gorgeous voice are the clear standouts.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, Sekirei has this distinct art style that I find really attractive. You really can't find it anywhere else, and you can almost immediately recognize almost any frame and know that it's Sekirei. Going back to what I said about the character designs earlier, they are really stellar for the Sekirei themselves. Each one is unique and attractive. the Ashikabi on the other hand are pretty bland, but I honestly believe it's intentional to help separate regular humans and Sekirei. The quality of ecchi was also really top notch for this one. The hi-jinks were fun and sexy, keeping you glued to the screen.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation isn't too bad either, there are a few action scenes that have much improved movement while the ecchi scenes have plenty of jiggle. Other than that, most scenes are pretty basic for its time. The action itself was intense and had some great choreography for certain fights. I don't think I can think of one fight that disappoints.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment I got out of this series initially was 10 because back when I first saw it, I was just getting into anime outside of Naruto and Dragonball Z. Back then, the action mixed with perversion blew my mind. I happened to re-watch it recently for old times sake, which is what prompted this review, and I can safely say I still enjoy it to this day.\\n\\n\r\nSekirei is a story of love. A story of fighting for what you love. And while some of it may tread familiar ground, it throws in enough unique elements and legitimacy for an actual harem to make it a real stand out in the genre. Sekirei will always hold a special place in my heart as it helped guide me into the wonderful world of anime. And thanks to its excellent designs, unique story, and lovable characters, I'm sure Sekirei will hold a special place in the heart anime community as well.",

The story was more about getting to meet the the character and a little smudge of fighting which I personally was looking forward to the fighting parts since theyalways tease the \"main\" girl always wanting to fight and yet they hardly do any fighting.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8 - Very good art, usually for me the art of an anime is the make it or break it for me to watch it unless it has a great story and decent art, but like again most echhi/harem all have good art and this is no exception.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7 - This anime has pretty decent music, decent enough to sit through the opening and ending.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7 - All the characters are great, they are very likable and they all have somewhat different stories and motives.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7 - I liked the anime in general, they kinda didnt progress too much in my opinion and i hope this is all just a set-up for the second season and i hope the mc grows a spine.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7 - Don't expect too much, just enjoy the anime for what it tries to be and go into it with a open mind and medium expectations.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this is my second review so im still new to this and my English isn't as strong as i'd like it to be but thank you for reading this again.",

The fan service in this series is a bit over the top.  In near every battle it seems that someone is gonna lose thier shirt. I still have yet to figure out why no scratches are left behind from the shredding.\r\nStory:  The overalll plot of the story is kind of original. I mean how many other anime feature a battle royal between  108 Busty women? I don't want togive away spoilers but there seems to be way too many loose ends at the end of the series. hopefully the sequel is able to answer most.  6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: This is one area of the anime that excelled. Fluid animations, bright vibrant settings, good detailing. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: OP and ED were rather nice and had a fair relevance to the series. Battle Sound Effects were average. The Seiyu (voice actors) were a perfect match for their character.  9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Sadly one of the more disappointing aspects of the series. In a cliched harem the chartacters are well... cliched. The same character personalities can be seen in any other anime of the genre. There is no originality. Another aspect in which this anime was lacking was in character developement.  There are soo many characters to be introduced to in this series that not one of them gets enough time for decent character buildup. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I must say that this was a enjoyable series. I'm a sucker for the comedy-romance genre and as the last episode came around I ended up wanting more.  8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n",

I loved the anime for it's humor and interesting characters, plus the action in here is superb. The ecchi feel in here is also flung around pretty easily amongst fight scenes. Problem is that the second season is taking too long to appear and the end of the first season was a little to cliff hang-ery-didy-didly-something.\r\nANYWAYS,I give this anime, SO FAR, 9/10. A great series worthy of continuation.",

It's easy to see how this show tries to appeal to its viewers and it really is appealing!\r\nThe story seems like it was made up to fit the genres that were aimed for: action and harem-comedy. It does have a deeper background story but after the first season I still know little of it.\r\nUsually the conversations aregood. I've never found them annoying but they have made me laugh.

            "content": "I am going to state this as simply as possible. When I review anime, a 7 is a 70% which means the anime was average but nothing special. I noticed most people would say that was worth a 5, or a 50%, but that is an F. If an anime didn't have any obvious flaws other than being nothing special, then I don't think it failed. So please read my reviews with this in mind. This is why most of my ratings seem on the high end. If I enjoyed it enough to finish it, it should be getting a C, not any lower.\r\nI willalso be saying the exact same thing about the other season, because I watched them as though they were one.\\n\\n\r\nSekirei was one of my first anime, sadly. At the time I really enjoyed it but now, after watching a significant amount of anime, I look back with a better idea of what 'good' anime is. The main issue with sekirei was the mediocre story and characters.\\n\\n\r\nStory(6/10)\\n\r\nI will say that the story is acceptable at best. Th main issue I have with reviewing the story is that there is little to no story that I can actually critique. However, the premise wan't too bad, and there was a steady progression in the show where the characters uncover more truths about the origins of themselves. All of that is well and good, but that is hardly enough plot for about 25 episodes of a show. There is little development, but it does still exist and it is rather interesting.\\n\\n\r\nArt(7/10)\\n\r\nI have no complaints about the art itself; the art is decent and the animation is pretty nice. Though, absolutely nothing about it is special in any way, so it sits at a 7 (good) art. I will complain about the character design, though. It is surprisingly distracting to have so many women with gigantic chests. The anime almost tried to work it in like some kind of plot device, but it was forced. Since many of the side characters didn't have giant chests, it was uncalled for to have the main characters so...round. Sekirei may have even benefited by getting some breast reduction surgery.\\n\\n\r\nSound(6/10)\\n\r\nAgain, hardly anything that stood out. Th voice acting and sound was decent enough, nothing in particular that was bad about it. However, it is nothing to remember, and wasn't anything interesting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(5/10)\\n\r\nI'll keep this limited, since you already read my main complaint here. I don't feel like any of the characters developed. Sometimes the anime almost forced development in, but in the end it made no difference. Th characters had little impact on the story and world around them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(6/10)\\n\r\nTh show was fun enough to watch, and interesting enough, to watch it until the end. That gets it a 7 in my book. The issue is that so much of it was either too much boob, or just boring. There were a couple of episodes that were hard to get through because of it.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end, Sekirei is a 6, fair. It had an interesting, though under developed story, and was funny enough to hold my attention. I would recommend this to anyone who likes boobs, butts, and harem. If you enjoy a story that won't keep you busy thinking about the characters or story, but just take up some free time, I think you would enjoy this show. However, I would not recommend it beyond that. If ecchi puts you off or you want a strong, character driven story, you came to the wrong place.",

It has everything that you need plus nudity; and don't forget that it really does havea serious plot too. Some ecchi comedy stuff just give us the nudity and not much else, but this is very different. Everything is balanced 50/50 for the audience to enjoy.

The close bonds they develop live in the shadow of an end that there can only be one left standing. Another thing this series does an outstanding job with is the handle on the young female character. Many series hyper-sexualize young women. Sekirei doesn't make this mistake. Instead, Ku is one of the most adorable and tasteful characters you will ever meet in an anime. The MC is a loser. So, nothing special there. And the formal blonde isa bit over the top. I feel like they could have expressed her personality by turning that dial to a good 7 instead of 10. It's worth mentioning that Sekirei is loaded with great fanservice. The soundtrack isn't too memorable. The art is nothing insane, but it's still great. The biggest problem with this series for me was the reason they are in this terrible position. The whole time you'll feel like their circumstances being the result of someone's entertainment is just a bit off. Just seems like they could have played that hand a bit better. All in all, Sekirei is an amazing show loaded with good fanservice and feels.",

Even if you like panty shots or stuff like that, but don't like nude boobs etc. you shouldn't watch this Anime.\r\nPersonally i loved Sekirei, cause the plot of most Harem/Ecchi anime is terrible, however in Sekirei, the plot is well-thought and exciting. The story starts right of the bat, and doesn't stop at any point.\r\nI won't go around spoiling the whole Anime, but you should be prepared for a lotof girls fighting for 1 guy, a guy who can be a douchebag at some point. That is the only thing I didn't like about it.\\n\\n\r\nSo, You should watch it if you like bouncing boobs for no reason, and if you like an anime with a good plot line, i highly recommend you this one.\\n\\n",

Sure, there was some pretty flagrant ecchi involved, but generally, that should be expected whenever you see the genre tagged with any show. Unfortunately, just as soon as Sekirei starts looking to be a pretty decent show, everything just falls apart.\r\nA lot of people seem to like comparing this show to Pokemon, and while I can agree the concept of a single person who has a group of beings fighting for them is similar to the trainer/Pokemonrelationship, I'd say that's where the similarities end. Unlike Pokemon, the show does not put a huge emphasis in \"collecting\" Sekirei. Sure, there are Ashikabi (humans with unique genes that allow Sekirei to \"emerge\"; I'll be getting into it later) that have more than one, but there's never a point where you feel it's better, or even necessary to have multiples. Even Minato, the male lead, rarely openly expresses an interest in actively searching out for more Sekirei, and in the end only has four. Sekirei also can, and do, act independently, some to the point where we rarely ever see their Ashikabi.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, I actually liked the concept of the show. It might not be a completely unique idea, but there is a certain degree of depth added by the fact that each Sekirei has a unique ability they can utilize during battle, as well as the presence of a sort of tier system that indicates a Sekirei's overall power. Basically, the girls are all given a number. The closer that number is to being #1, the more powerful the are considered. It's a simple concept to be sure, but the show does place a lot of importance on it, in much the same way Claymore did.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, as much as I like the concept, its also what enables my least favorite part of the show, the whole harem aspect. While Sekirei can fight on their own, they become much stronger after they \"emerge\". The only way they can achieve this is to form a bond with an Ashikabi. There's no limit as to how many Sekirei can undergo this bond with an Ashikabi, so long as each of them undergoes the contract, which requires the two to swap mucous. In other words, (surprise, surprise) kiss. As horribly cliche as that is, it's not the part I hate the most. No, that distinction lies with the group of Sekirei that follow around Minato, our resident failure of a human turned ultra-stud for no apparent reason.\\n\\n\r\nTo understand my dislike, let me shed some light on my feelings about the harem genre. While it would be easy to say if you're watching a show tagged with harem, you should know what to expect, that is in no way true. Sure, there are those shows which contain the stereotypical harems which involve a group of several women who all are in love with the one man. Think: Campione! Girls Bravo. Those are the types I typically dislike. Then there are the shows where the girls are actually realistic enough to see that the guy is a tool and/or simply isn't interested in them. Think: Is This a Zombie?, Love Hina. Those I do actually like since the girls generally aren't living with or around him because they want to, and for the most part, there is only one main love interest the lead has.\\n\\n\r\nSekirei falls into the former, in the worst way. Minato is quite possibly the most useless of all the male leads I've seen in a harem show. He's failed his entrance exams twice, and evidently that's enough for him to outright give up on trying to further his education. But after losing his apartment, and getting his allowance cut from mommy, he's got to get a job...which he is fired from. But hey, he's living in an evidently rent-free apartment that takes in Sekirei, and who can be bothered with things like responsibility what with giant, unclothed tits flying around all over Tokyo?\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of giant breasts, let's go into the art for this show. For what it's worth, this is a pretty well animated show. The environments all look surprisingly clean and are generally pretty colorful. The rather impressive level of detail given to the effects tied to the Sekirei's unique powers make the battle scenes pretty flashy and fun to watch too. Character design is...inconsistent in general. It's really wierd; one moment, the girls bodies look pretty much realistic (aside from their impossibly gargantuan racks of course), and the next they'll look like walking, talking hourglasses. And I mean that literally, there are several moments in the show where one character will go from having a believably proportioned body in one scene, to having a six inch waiste the next, only to go back to normal later. It's actually creepy in a way...\\n\\n\r\nBut I digress; you may be wondering why boobs made me think of the art? Well...I can't lie, the boobs in this show are shockingly detailed in comparison to those I've seen in other ecchi shows. And with mixed shame and pride, I have to say, I've seen my fair share of animated boobies as the ecchi genre is a guilty pleasure of mine. There's just something about their nipples, it's kind of hard to explain really. You'd have to actually see it to really know what I'm talking about.\\n\\n\r\nSooo...ahem...yeah...\\n\\n\r\nANYWAY, back on track, sound isn't special really. Aside from the op, which is actually really uplifting and pretty epic sounding. I've heard a lot about the Japanese vo work being pretty bad despite having some pretty big names attatched, and while I can't comment on that, I can say that the English dub isn't bad, though it's not great either. There's a few well known names involved, and they do decently, but that's really about it. If you're trying to figure out which way to watch, I'd recommend you just go with what you usually prefer. \\n\\n\r\nThe worst part of this show is hands down the characters. To sum them all up in one word, I would say \"generic\" would fit the bill nicely. You have the overly devoted, and overly loyal airheaded boobs, the hard-ass, pushy boobs, the nerdy boobs who for some reason wants to fondle all the other boobs, the catty twin set of boobs, the tomboyish boobs, the loli (and that's as awkward as it sounds when you consider she's a Sekirei that becomes emerged during the course of the show and that means her and her Ashikabi kissed in a way that enabled their mucous to come in contact), and the utter drones of men they serve (except the tomboy, who's Ashikabi is actually a girl).\\n\\n\r\nAnd the girls all adhere to those labels to a tee. There's absolutely nothing dynamic about them and there's really no depth to any of them, in fact, in the case of the loli, she actually degraded as a character in my opinion. Before emerging she's depicted in an almost mystic way, reaching out and speaking to Minato in his thoughts, yet once she becomes one of his Sekirei she suddenly barely speaks and starts randomly wearing animal costumes, communicating in what is supposed to be cute sounds and facial expressions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd really have a hard time recommending this show to anyone; there's simply not enough going for it. Sure, the concept behind the Sekirei Plan is kind of interesting, and the fights are enjoyable to watch, but in every aspect of this show, I could easily recommend other series that does it much better. In fact, if you're into the whole harem thing, I'd actually recommend the previously mentioned Campione!; as much as I disliked that show, it still has a lot more going for it than this show does, and it's got more than a few similarities.",

            "content": "Alright! Finally found out how to review. Good, Good. Sorry, you're not reading this to find that out, right? You came here to hear my thoughts on this so i'll stop rambling and get to it then, okay? (Sorry about that, just trying to be fresh, and easy to read, for lack of a better word.)\r\nAhem, Sekirei...where to start. Well i'll just follow the layput already established, that seems to work.\r\nStory: I quite liked it, It has a (mostly) unique idea behind it that was really fun to be along on the ride. I mean come on who doesn't like the idea of having powers.Course on another note, the idea's sorta like a mature almost sexual version of pokemon...PLease don't take this the wrong way! Anyway the story was good enough to entertain me all throughout without making me \"stress\" over it like code geass or something would.\\n\\n\r\nArt: He he...The art... it's very...open about stuff...like females shirts. of course there's also the obligatory well endowed female cast. By the end you'll have your fill of naked women and big tatas whether you want it or not. I strongly feel that this didn't take away from the show at all...it just made me hope to god that my parents didn't walk in the room and get the wrong idea. ( No seriously mom, it's not what it looks like!) Anyway i wouldn't let that ruin this show, if it does for you. while there are scenes that have this in almost every episode, it isn't the whole episode maybe a scene of two? Anyway,  actual animation ( Artstyle) was very clean ( Boobs really move like that?... No...) and crisp the whole way through.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music was very nice, some good songs in there. None felt like they were overused and everyone of them really helped with the mood for scenes. The voice acting ( I watched in english...and some japanese, when megavideo decided to give out on me. stupid 70 minute timer thing...) was alot better in english than japanese for me. Not because it's my native tongue ( Though it is...) but i felt like the characters were more...lively, as hard as that may be for some to believe. Course it's my opinion, you do what you want!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:All the main characters were very solid and easy to get along with. It felt like i was there goofing off with them or in the action fighting alongside them. All of them were likeable which is nice in a harem like anime, cause in some ways that makes it easier to watch. Never fun to have the one character you hate keep popping in and ruin the fun. This really didn't have one of those which made it that much better.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Not much to say, It was very enjoyable. My thoughts on the previous four categories can attest to my saying that I throughly enjoyed watching this.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Alright I won't be as bland as I was on the last one (My english teacher always said my fourth paragraph was the weakest...). Overall I really enjoyed this anime. Some might say the length was a downer for it or the...ecchi aspects to it made it weird. But I, someone who never watches ecchi or the like found this to be a lovely anime. The length was fine with me...after all the second season is out ( Though i'm waiting for the english dub...I quite liked all of the voice actors in this one, so i'm gonna support my team.) I'd definetely recommend this to anyone looking for a good action, ecchi, or romantic comedy. Course if you're looking for all of those in one package then here you go! ( Gift wrapped with my seal of approval and all!)\\n\\n\r\nWell that's my two sense, hopefully i didn't ramble too much and my lame jokes at least caused a smirk. Thanks for reading and I hope this helped!\\n\\n\r\n-Eriad Eternas-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

So the character design. It is ok at best. Most of the characters when they are close up look the same. It is a little annoying, but honestly did not take me out of the experience. The story is very eh at best. I mean there isn't much to go on for a harem hunger games you know? I mean I came into this series not really expecting much of the story. Thecharacters are ok to. I mean all of the stereotypes are included in this, Tsundere that doesn't care, one he is obviously going to be with, the little crazy one, and the WAY to young one. Like I feel uncomfortable when she is on screen. However they are pretty good. Then my biggest criticism is this. It does not have too much fighting in it for being a series about fighting. However one thing to take into consideration is that this is a comedy harem, and that's what it is. Which it does pretty well to be honest. It is a solid series. The sound design is pretty good. The writing is ok. The animation is also pretty good as well. I thought it was a ok series. I would recommend this to anyone that is just looking for a start in the harem genre.",

Sekirei delivers that! 10/10 for this show, all I can really say is.. wow! This series mixes Martial-art hand-to-hand combat with great 'powers' and abilities. The fact that the girls are the ones fighting really adds a different element to a series. On top of that, the fact that most of them are all busty babes is an obvious plus for viewers, and the fact that these girls get naked on occasionreally gives the series a 'real' feeling, nothing held back etc.\\n\\n\r\nFor those viewers who'd normally disagree with nudity, the simple fact is that even though there is a descent amount of it and alot of 'fanservice', the story is so strong that it just fits into the 'flow' of each episode, so you don't really notice it unless you're one of those types that pause it to have a 'good look' at the girls. All said, this show will be my favourite for a long time, and I can't wait for Sekirei Pure Engagement or 'Season 2' to be released here is Australia! ^_^",

            "content": "Part of my favorites, I like the Ecchi genre so much that I could ever want that genre as the my reference of drawings. As for me Sekirei is one o them, as like ordinary Harem anime, it more focus on more women and central man as the theme, but I can say that it is one of the kind since it also blend the fightings scene so it will not becoming boring anime of all times.\r\nAlthough there are differ elements between the manga and anime, I can see that the plot is concentrating the plot. Where ever the situation of the scenario changes, itstill like the original manga story. Very good job for that one.\\n\\n\r\nFor artwork, I give the 7/7 for that and the story is really put up the balance as the artwork, so it also given 8/8 for that too. I would expect the finale of the story. Any season will be put on the attention to catch up the ending itself.",

            "content": "STORY (7)\r\nOkay. I literally just finished watching Sekirei, and the story is about the only thing I really enjoyed about it. Basically, \"Sekirei\" are girls who have an \"Ashikabi.\" The Ashikabi are somewhat like the Sekirei's \"master\" and they must fulfill the wishes of their Ashikabi at all times. The rules of Sekirei is that they have to fight every other Sekirei they come in contact with.\r\nMinato Sahashi is an intelligent boy living in Tokyo. However, Minato crumbles under pressure which has resulted in two failed college entrance exams.\r\nOne day, Minato is walking somewhere when suddenly a girl literally falls from the sky. Minato learnsthat the girl's name is Misubu, but doesn't have time to learn much else because Misubu is being chased by two other women, Minato later finds out are Sekirei.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot then progresses when Misubu has to stay with Minato, and announces that he is her Ashikabi, sealing the deal with a kiss. As the story goes on, Minato accidentally gathers a harem of Sekirei at his command, which almost brings more trouble than it's worth.\\n\\n\r\nInteresting, right? Wrong. The story would have been all it could have been if there WASN'T SO MUCH DAMN FANSERVICE. A bit of ecchi, I don't mind. THIS, however, I can barely deal with. It wasn't as bad as HOTD or Highschool DxD, becayse this I actually managed to finish, but wow. Do you know how much time they wasted with panty shots? Unbelievable.\\n\\n\r\nART (6)\\n\r\nThe art, well.. meh. It was meh and I don't know how else to describe it. There wasn't anything particularly 'wow' about it, but nothing that bad either.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (5)\\n\r\nI watched the dubbed version, and let me just say I didn't enjoy it. The supporting characters were alright, but DON'T GET THE VOICE OF THE MAIN CHARACTER WRONG OR THE WHOLE THING GOES DOWN IN SMOKE. Jeez.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (5)\\n\r\nThere wasn't much time for character development when all that was focused on was boobs and ass. In fact, the most character development was in the last episode, which is no good to anybody because it's a bit late to show the characters in a relatable way then. You mainly only get to see the characters bickering and fighting over Minato, which is amusing at times, but when it's half of every single episode, it's not so much fun to watch. It gets pretty boring.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT/OVERALL (5.5)\\n\r\nThe story was good, but everything else was either average or just plain bad. So unfortunately, I can't score any higher than 5.5.. Although it was a good anime with some interesting ideas, there was too much time spent on fanservice for them to actually develop anything interesting. \\n\r\nI guess it just isn't my type of anime.",

            "content": "Okay Lion Tamers, I'm finally getting to Sekirei, et al!\r\nFirstly, I will not be talking about the excessive fan service and other related aspects of this Anime. Other reviewers have done this to death, and inspired themselves more than enough !\r\nSecondly, I will also not talk about the surface plot; it has also been done into the ground by others.\r\nThere are however, matters that have not been discussed; that I think needs some words.\r\n1).  The Sekirei\r\nThese people are off-world aliens, in cold-storage. Some back-story about them, in their own right; would have been nice. But there is none. Their aged vessel is discovered bycollege students. Were the Sekirei sent to help the Mankind they found? Were they sent here to conquer us? Or did they just crash-land, and just never get woke up, by the onboard computer (which is shown still running)? More importantly, in the vein of the resurrecting of the Sekirei, by Minaka Hiroko and others; what would the Sekirei have been if they were never \"adjusted\"? We will never know. Is there any larger lost opportunity?\\n\\n\r\n2). The descent into pure evil.\\n\r\nMinaka Hiroko is not the genius he is portrayed. Anyone can back-engineer someone else's technology, and then become a profiteer on the backs of the superior creators of the technology, in the first place. Did Minaka create anything new? No. Did he use the gene-pool he discovered, to advance the intelligence and capabilities of Mankind (including himself)? No. When we realize that genetic modifications not only change the living, in their own time; they also change the next generation and the next. The changes tend to be permanent.\\n\\n\r\nBut Minaka had a better idea. Let's use the modified Sekirei to promote a game, which ultimately ends in the death of all Sekirei. They die, for a purpose that is obviously a huge lie. The viewer should not accept Minaka's premise. There is no prize, he knows they're all going to die. No win, no way out, pain and suffering for everybody connected.\\n\\n\r\nWHAT A WASTE!\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, Sekirei is a snuff-anime. It's not about Life. It's all about Death. Heroic moments in the story line do not forgive the fact that ultimately, Minaka Hiroko will find a way to force the Sekirei to kill each other. That was his original aim, his process during the game, and his plan for the ultimate outcome. It's all about the Game, for his amusement. He might as well have been a audience member at a Roman Circus, Gladiators murdering each other and all. No other value is possible, for Minaka. He even hands out strange gifts, to the viewers and participants; like the Roman Emperor used to do when he offers Bread and Wine to the viewing throng, for their amusement and edification.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is quite good. The music is mediocre at best; I would have expected other reviewers to have higher standards. The interior music, in support of plot points, is more than adequate.\\n\\n\r\nThe acting dialog is above average. For some anime, I like sub-english, because the Japanese actors fit the characters well. But in this particular case; both the sub and dub versions are more than adequate. I happen to be a fan of several dub-actors: Colleen Clinkenbeard, Stephanie Young, Jamie Marchi, Clarine Harp, Brittany Karbowski; and many others. All are in attendance, in Sekirei. And all are inspired.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end however, Heroic deeds, and Heroic strains of Music; cannot take away from the basic component of Sekirei.\\n\\n\r\nA sadness beyond all description.\\n\\n\r\nI give Sekirei, and it's second season \"Pure Engagement\" a 7.",
