            "content": "Sidonia no Kishi is truly a marvel. When I began the first episode and laid my eyes on the CGI, I felt a bit underwhelmed and my opinion  began to waver on the show; However, SnK soon made me realize that I could have never been so wrong and I'm glad for that. Sidonia no Kishi is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi anime where everyday mankind lives in fear of being decimated, but continues to survive on an enormous ship known as Sidonia. There struggle is against an alien-species known as the Gauna which have brought humanity to its knees before and the only thing betweenthem and Sidonia are the pilots of the Gardes(mechs) whom protect Sidonia. This setting is not necessarily new, but the way it is handled and presented  can only be said to be top-notch.\\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10):\\n\r\nThe story sets itself for excitement, thrills and edge of your seat action which is all done masterfully in SnK. Considering humanity could be on the brink of being destroyed on a daily basis there should really never be a dull moment and there never was. Even at times when the scene was supposed to ease the tension or be a bit more heart-warming not once did it lose my interest. The sci-fi played a huge role when showing off technological advancements and it's thanks to this and the anime's emphasis on it which made it only that much more interesting. Every single moment had its intensity, the plot would constantly mesmerize you with excitement, but evens it out superbly with some comedy and scenes to ease the tension before throwing you back in the action again. The story has been done many times over, but not a lot could match up with what Sidonia no Kishi brought to the table.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\r\n The world is brought to life using CGI which is what gave me the first impression that it would be underwhelming. In-fact, I felt rather unsettled seeing the CGI, but moving forward giving the anime a chance I realized there would be no Sidonia no Kishi without it. The CGI is used masterfully for every scene and whenever it was time to buckle up and fly into the heat of battle the action was on a completely different level from anything else thanks to it. While it did take some getting used to for when we were simply watching our characters walking around, it became no problem soon enough and well worth it to just see the Gardes in action. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10):\\n\r\nThe sound completely exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend if you have a pair of fantastic headphones, use them. The quality of the sound during the encounters versus the Gauna were some of the best I have ever heard. Once I put on my headset and listened, I was completely immersed. The engines roaring, weapons firing and so-on, you could tell the studio payed especially close attention to the details and it was phenomenal. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter(8/10):\\n\r\nThe characters in SnK were very interesting. While I cannot say they were completely original they each had unique characteristics to separate themselves from most other characters. Each character evolved in his or her own way and it was fantastic to see some of the interactions between them after the course of some events had taken place. It's really thanks to the sci-fi setting that allows for such diversity among them and while you may not appreciate every character; Each character we're introduced to have their own role in the story and I cannot deny that it's thanks to what can be created within the sci-fi setting which makes each of them only that more intriguing. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nSidonia no Kishi had done everything completely right in my eyes when it came to entertainment. Every episode had a huge significance and would leave you with an aching appetite for more. Every time the Gardes had flown off into battle I was completely overjoyed with excitement and even in the more relaxing scenes I was still just taken aback by all the twists the plot had taken along with the progression. For an anime to be able to succeed in capturing the audiences attention every single episode is a grand feat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10):\\n\r\nSidonia no Kishi is an amazing anime that should not simply be overlooked. The CGI, while may take some getting used to for some, is an integral part of the anime and those whom give it a chance will see why. Even for those with a dislike of mecha I'd recommend this to as the major focus on character interactions, fantastic sound and breath-taking action all put into one package makes this one of the greater Sci-fi mecha anime out there to look out for. Out of all 12 episodes there was not one that was uneventful and it continued strong from start to finish. \\n\\n\r\nSo what are you waiting for pilot? Suit up, it's time for the Knights of Sidonia to move out.",

            "content": "So when I first found out that there was not only a manga but also an anime with the same title (yet spelled differently) as my favorite song by Muse, I felt the need to check out what it was. So of course when I first started watching the show I was pretty pumped to find the same kind of popcorn action that I would get while watching a film like the Star Wars saga or reading a novel like Ender's Game. I did get the show that provided me with that kind of action, but that's just it; I got EXACTLY what I expectedand I wasn't blown away in any way. Knights of Sidonia is definitely that kind of blockbuster spaceships and explosions fun you would want in an anime, but it doesn't bring anything new to the table and ends up being a steaming mishmash of vapid and under cooked sci-fi tropes that were cool to watch but didn't light me up in any way along with a plot that moves to fast to fit everything in. However I am willing to overlook some of the production values that I consider subjectively bad if I get around to watching the recently planned season 2 or find copies of the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe first aspect of the show that I was rather taken aback by was the use of 3D animation instead of traditionally drawn shows. I was really turned off by the stale looking world and characters at first, but I think it honestly grew on me and most reminded me of the corridors of the video game Dead Space (minus all the bone-cracking gore and alien enemies that experience provided) and the seed ship Sidonia, all its inhabitants, and the overall look of the set pieces has an interesting, pristine feel to them and it almost felt like it could be the real interior of a space vessel. In addition to that, the space battles were not only the best aspect of the show, but they looked really cool too, and I as the viewer really got the feel that the Gardes, pilots and commanders were not only fighting the Gauna, but the massive size of Sidonia and space itself. An area where the animation took somewhat of a nose dive would be in the case of the characters; they all look eerily the same, and it was highly jarring dealing with several characters that looked the same at first. Granted I could tell who Tanikaze was (but that was mostly because of JYB's voice), but until the characters were singled out and focused upon more, Yuhata and Norio were simply Green-Haired Girl and Sephiroth Wannabe. Then Hoshijiro got introduced with Izana to quickly follow, and there was a moment where I thought they were the same person, and so seeing them both on the screen at the same time was more jarring than it should have been.\\n\\n\r\nSo while the animation was here and there and the fight scenes were awesome, many elements of the plot and characters suffer from being cardboard cutouts and aforementioned sci-fi staple tropes that didn't make Knights of Sidonia stand out as much as I had hoped it would. But first lets talk about the good. Whenever the characters get lost or they encounter a Gauna, they need to make the trek through space using just the right strategy to get back or they won't survive, and they made up for some pretty intense moments in the show that weren't the amazing fight sequences. The other interesting aspect that the show expressed was how much pressure the humans were under in order to squelch and survive such as photosynthesizing instead of eating and putting on gravity belts whenever the ship turned were both useful and interesting elements to the show. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, most of the plot and character personalities I feel were overused and have been done better in other places. Tanikaze is a very staple main character, and the fact that he's this 'chosen one' pilot that can use the 'best garde' really has no purpose other than the fact that he's the underdog and we as the audience were supposed to root for his struggle, I guess. The other thing that bothered me about his character is that he got in trouble trying to steal food and got caught meddling in top secret government stuff and didn't get prosecuted for either. This is why the 'chosen one' trope that is Tanikaze is didn't make the drive of the show interesting; he's boring, rigid and doesn't develop much at all. As for most of the other characters are those kinds that only have one personality trait or motive: Yuhata is smart, sweet, and likes Tanikaze. Hoshijiro: same, Izana: Same. Then there's the endless stream of Red Shirts that like Tanikaze because he's Tanikaze, and the immortal council members who are mysterious and cold for the sake of being mysterious and cold, and Norio is the cranky bitter guy. I'm listing them as such because I feel like that's really all there is to them. When they die there's no weight. When there's love, it's forced. When there's action, they just support Tanikaze. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course while I adore sci-fi and the bright flashy robot and alien fights were the point of no return where the analytic part of my brain goes to die, the rest of what makes sci-fi interesting; cloning, ship building, prosthetic robot stuff, talking animals and human preservation technology, it's all cool, but it has to have a point. I ended up having more questions than I had answers about stuff the show made up itself, and for the use of sci-fi tropes that I had seen before, I had seen them being used in a better way. Some of the new stuff that was brought to the table was the aforementioned (and well done) photosynthesis vs. food idea, and the giant talking bear. Why? Why is it here? Why is the immortal council so cold? Why are they trying to hide the Gauna-human hybrid from Tanikaze even though they told him what it was when they asked? I had far too many questions left unanswered, and it put a damper on the enjoyment of the show as good writing to me is all about what to write and when. Of course all of this can be overlooked if the manga or season 2 will fill in some of these blanks for me.\\n\\n\r\nEven if had a lot of complaints resulting in my opinion on Knights of Sidonia being average to good, it was still an enjoyable watch if you do like sci-fi. Sure a lot of the show can be criticized but if you're there to watch it for fun and not for analysis, I would highly recommend it to you. However if you're looking for something more that robot and alien flashy colors and lasergun fights with a pinch of melodrama and scifi cliches inbetween, I'd stay away.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "When certain premises in anime are overused without variation they're quickly labeled as \"run of the mill\".. Like dystopian with mecha. Because of that many anime try to change minute details regarding the setting or premise to stand apart. However, if something normally considered \"run of the mill\" is executed with proper care it can be seen as rather refreshing. Knights of Sidonia is a rare case, not quite falling towards being called mediocre nor does it fall towards refreshing. Rather it all depends on the individual to make the judgement call. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nSet in the distant future, the story takes place upon a spaceshipwhere the lone surviving civilization of humanity live in a stagnant state of unrest due to the attacks of giant ominous creatures known only  as \"Gauna\". These creatures are rather interesting as they seem to have the ability to mimic the action and appearance of things they encounter, giving them an eerie presence as the series progresses. \\n\r\nDue to these frequent attacks by the Gauna the story never feel bogged down to a slow paced narrative. This makes for good binge watching material as your curiosity pushes you to one episode after the next. Despite the pace being powered by propane the tone of the series is all over the place. The story goes from \"Shingeki no Kyojin in space\" to \" let's build a harem\" at a drop of a hat . This can be very off putting at times but it's slowly resolved back to an even tone towards the show's midpoint.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nit's hard to judge the art for this anime. It's a mixture of both CGI and cell shaded animation. The CGI is rather jarring upon 1st encounter but quickly becomes tolerable as you become immersed in the show's setting. On normal occasions if someone were to tell me to watch a show composed entirely of CGI, I would probably think \"well this is gonna be some ugly shit\" but in this case it works. In fact I think it's safe to say that the CGI gives Knights of Sidonia it's special signature. This is especially true for the fight sequences. However when the focus are on the characters, their movements feel artificial and stiff. It's also obvious that recycled footage were used during the launch sequences and team formation. The flaws are too noticeable to ignore and ultimately impedes on the score from being higher.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music score is virtually nonexistent. It's all muddled together with very little difference separating them. Only standout were the ones played during Gauna encounters.. The opening song however is one worth noting. I has an orchestral tone while still being rather tranquil, making it one that you simply can't skip. Voice actors all perform their roles with no hiccups but there wasn't any standouts that come to mind.  The only other standout being the sound affects pertaining to the lasers (heigus cannon), thrusters and other devices used. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all a dismal mess. None of them receive any decent characterization. Our main character is basically another \"self insert\" protagonist with little personality to speak of and is good at everything he does. Basically he's the vanilla of most MCs coming out today and can easily be replaced by one of many other series with no difference noticed.\\n\r\nthe antagonist Kunato, upon 1st introduction seemed 1 note. Before he even muttered a word you already know he was going to be the 'arrogant, rich, short tempered douche '.. But surprisingly he becomes the only character with decent characterization. As the show progresses it also becomes easier to  sympathize with him. \\n\r\nAnd finally a plethora of females! Because what's a harem without some right? But seriously there's only two female characters worth mentioning and that's Izana & Hoshijiro (Izana being non gender but I digress). Both of which have no real characterization beyond being 1 dimensional archetypes but they do get a more screentime than the rest.\\n\r\nOH YEAH! there's also a talking bear with a robot hand that we never get a proper explanation for but we'll ignore that lol\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\ndespite this show's numerous flaws it's an enjoyable watch for those looking for a sci-fi popcorn flick. The characters were nothing special but the story carried it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is made to be enjoyed by the casual viewing masses and is an easy watch. However seasonal anime fans will notice the overused tropes and archetypes in a heartbeat and that might be the deciding factor on whether they like it or think it's mediocre. Either way the series to the very least was entertaining with little down time to speak of and can be easily finished in one sitting. With that in mind I recommend giving this one a go.",

            "content": "The pledge:\r\nWe, the knights of Sidonia.\r\nPledge ourselves as one united galaxy protectors.\r\nRegardless of gender, race or religion.\r\nTo protect the outer space from destruction.\r\nThat is caused by Gauna floating in outer space.\r\nSo as to achieve peace, happiness and progress for \r\nour universe.\r\nI came up with the pledge which describes best of the Knights of Sidonia. This anime is directed by Kobun Shizuno from Polygon Pictures and it is an adaptation from Nihei's manga \"Knights of Sidonia\". As you may know, Nihei Tsutomu specializes in cyperpunk genre manga like for example, BLAME & Biomega. \r\nThis anime reminds me of Gravity the movie. \r\nSTORY (9):\r\nThe story takes placein the future where Earth is destroyed by monsters called Gauna, and mankind has to flee from Earth. Each Gauna has a core that is protected by the placenta, and once the placenta and core are destroyed, the Gauna's body disintegrate. In order to stop the Gauna, \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a similar idea of Attack on Titan where human is on the verge of extinction. \"Attack on Titan\" villains are  the Titans while \"Sidonia no Kishi\" villains are the Gauna. \\n\\n\r\nSpace is big and beautiful but it can be frightening.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime also shows that not all tactics can work. Just like in any action anime, some tactics can have benefits and problems. Just like gravity can sometimes affect the performance in the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nI did like the way how the story handles the characters. Imagine surviving in outer space with no oxygen or air or water like in episode 5, where Tanikaze & Hoshijiro are stuck in outer space. In order to survive in outer space, you need oxygen tank and lots of food and drinks supply. \\n\\n\r\nI also liked how the robots form in circles to show union. \\n\\n\r\nART (10):\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people are annoyed by the usage of CGs. However, this anime managed to handle the CG well, making the animation look stellar. This anime uses 3D animation.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (10):\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, I loved the opening song \"Sidonia\" by Angela. This song plays a tone that displays courage and bravery. I also liked the ending song \"Show\" by Eri Kitamura. The ending song plays in a rock and roll tune.\\n\\n\r\nAngela also sang some songs like the opening of Coppelion \"Angel\". Eri Kitamura is also a voice actresses in some roles she has done like Eve from NEEDLESS.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (9):\\n\\n\r\nI liked the way how they handle the characters. At least they never show me any annoying traits.\\n\\n\r\nTanikaze Nagate was the type of character who always try to do his best no matter what happens. I thought at first he was like a wimp, but surprisingly he really develops as a character from there on.\\n\\n\r\nIzana Shinatose is also a decent character who also tries to help Nagate as possible as she can. \\n\\n\r\nLala Hiyama was the type who also supports Nagate just like a real mother. \\n\\n\r\nShizuka Hoshijiro was pointless as a character. All she does was just have a bond with Nagate that I didn't feel attached to.\\n\\n\r\nKunato was the character I despised the most because he treated Nagate like crap in episode 7. However, he didn't affect me in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nI wished that some characters have more screen time and back story so that at least they can stand out in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (9):\\n\\n\r\nApocalyptic anime always highlight tragedies in real life events. One of the example is Sidonia no Kishi. I also wished that some characters have more screen time. In fact, I wanted to know more about how Gauna existed.\\n\\n\r\nI also heard that season 2 would be announced. At least season 2 would give enough time to develop the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSidonia no Kishi has great morale like surviving in space is never easy because in space, there's no oxygen and low gravity. Gravity can affect people's movement.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is non-stop fun, the soundtrack is amazing, stellar animation, great character development. That's why I give it a 9/10. If you are into sci-fi action, you will love this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI will never feel bored after watching this anime.\\n",

            "content": "Nihei Tsutomu is one of the leading manga authors of the cyberpunk genre. With his amazing artwork in pieces like Biomega and BLAME!, it was obvious he was on a roll by the time he got into creating Sidonia no Kishi. The problem became apparent though, in his most acclaimed piece BLAME!. People had a hard time comprehending the story. Though BLAME! was experimental and had beautiful atmosphere and artwork, the adaptation did not turn out well. This created a stigma with whether or not Nihei\u2019s work could be adapted well. When a new animation studio decided to pick up Nihei\u2019s newest work, Sidonia noKishi, people were interested. The hesitation lay in the medium of animation, CGI. Now the question remains as to whether Sidonia no Kishi would wipe of the stigma brought on by the BLAME! Adaptation, or just follow in its footsteps.\\n\\n\r\nKnights of Sidonia is a futuristic cyberpunk piece which is Nihei Tsutomu\u2019s niche. The big change from BLAME! to this piece though, was the story. The story, rather than leaving it more ambiguous, was more straightforward. The human race is forced into space due to a predatory and mysterious enemy called the Gauna. In order to defend the last bastion of the human race, an enormous space ship called Sidonia, the humans make use of giant mechs called Guardes to do battle with the Gauna.  This setting allows for more dramatic turns to take place as humanity scrambles to face off against an enemy they know hardly anything about. The technology is advanced, allowing for interesting views upon population control and reproduction\u2014along with the scientific breakthroughs with a certain energy called, Higg\u2019s Particles. This energy is in fact a real thing, and not out of the realm of possibility. However, proper utilization of it will not be achievable for many years to come. It is evident that a lot of research went into the creation of the way of life on the ship of Sidonia. The Guana alone have a mystique behind them that keeps your interest as you witness them grotesquely evolve during battles. With all this captivating lore aside, there is a lot of explanation which takes time to get through. However, this does not hinder the pacing, which is a really good thing because it allows you enjoy the story along with fleshing out their lifestyle.\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the plot itself is character driven, and the environment takes a backseat to some more trivial problems that help flesh out the main cast. The melding of both the situation at hand and the character\u2019s personal struggles is well played out, with little to no hiccups. Between the intense battling at times though, it seems a little too lax for my taste. Let\u2019s say you are on a mission where you lose twenty five lives in the process and instead of mourning, you go to the beach or a festival. I know it\u2019s to take away the stress of everyday life, but if that is going to be done, I don\u2019t want to have a smaller struggle happen while they are on break. Just little nitpicks on the story. All in all, it has a solid base to segue forward from here into the next season.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve already stated that the plot is more character driven than complex, but in order to do this successfully you need to have a dynamic cast. Tsutomu did this beautifully; through each relationship and each battle, the main cast continues to grow and become more realistic. Though making a cast too realistic could cause them to be boring, these characters did not have this trouble. Each character had quirks that allowed you to easily distinguish between them, even with the infinite amount of clones that are pilots. The clones show that despite being genetically similar, their experiences are what shape them into who they are. Though there are a few odd ducks here and there that makes you pause for a second, like the talking bear, all in all the cast meshes together well. The lead character is far from uninteresting, in fact, he is probably the most interesting character (besides one of the possible love interests, Izana). The cast are like everyday people and you can understand the emotions that they experience. This is war, and they are soldiers, not happy-go-lucky high school students, and they act like it.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is forgettable at times but is always ambient. It truly meshes into the beautiful atmosphere created by Tsutomu and Polygon Pictures. The song worth mentioning in full is, of course, the opening song. The opening is describing the thought process of those out there fighting the Gauna. They are soldiers, they are not only fighting for themselves, but also so that others may have a future. Even if they die out there, they will have given it their all. It even has a different feel than other openings and sounds like a war chant which pumps up the viewer each time they watch. \\n\\n\r\nNow here we get to the sketchy part of the anime, the animation. Now I know Polygon Works is an upcoming studio and this is their first anime, but it actually wasn\u2019t entirely bad as many people say. While at times, it is a detriment when you are trying to figure out who is who with the lighting at times, it also has a decent amount of pros. The grungy textures of the buildings give them a broken down feel, setting the atmosphere for the times. Things sometimes seem more polished, which makes them lose that same appeal. For example, the ship has been in commission for hundreds of years, it shouldn\u2019t be in pristine condition anywhere. The Gauna look demented and terrifying and the action sequences are really well done. For a first time studio, it was pretty good CGI. \\n\\n\r\nKnights of Sidonia is my favourite piece from Nihei Tsutomu. Though it is hard getting all the nuances in his drawing into an animated format, they did a great job. The characters were as strong as I remember them from the manga. The gravity of the situation is mediocrely communicated compared to the manga, but the overall atmosphere is very cyberpunk, playing well to its genre. While BLAME! might not have made a great impact, Sidonia no Kishi certainly showed us that there is a capability to adapt Nihei\u2019s masterful artwork and story off of the page.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8.9\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.2\\n\r\nMusic: 7.8\\n\r\nAnimation: 7.5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8.4\\n\r\nOverall: 8.4\\n\r\nEdited by: PhantomTigers, imabooterfly\\n",

            "content": "Imagine a world, waking up every day, and realizing that you could be exterminated any moment. In the world of Sidonia no Kishi, that\u2019s a common trend for every single human who are still alive. The primary cause of this are the Gauna, alien extraterrestrials that have devastated humanity into near distinction. As the show takes place in an apocalyptic future, a journey with Sidonia no Kishi will be one of the dark ages. \r\nThe brainchild of the series and idea is Tsutomu Nihei, known for his other manga works such as Blame and Biomega. In Sidonia no Kishi, he spawns the idea of sci-fiand packages it with war themes. For instance, humanity is at war against the mysterious Gauna. Their means of survival depends on a generation skip known as the Sidonia. Since Earth have been annihilated, there\u2019s little hope besides working together in unity for survival. We get the very sense of despair with our characters as they live in near hopelessness. One particular character named Nagate Tanikaze stands out as a top ace in the series as result of simulator training from underground. But one day, he comes out from the layers of Sidonia and witness reality.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the first opening moments of the show, it\u2019s easy to tell that humanity is in a path of despair. The fact that their previous home planet Earth no longer exists serves a testament for their solitude. But for what\u2019s worth, the show still depicts humanity as a fighting group, resilient and with articulate sense for payback. The show illustrates this with Sidonia being the most prominent ship, perhaps because the others have been gone for over eight centuries. With Sidonia though, the show portrays them as the sole resistance. Calling them knights is probably a better term that fits with the title of the show by translation \u2013 Knights of Sidonia. It\u2019s important to realize the show reveals secrets and plot twists relating to Sidonia and the population itself. Startling twists tells stories and controversies gets people talking.\\n\\n\r\nReality bites Nagate as he realizes how grim it is. Throughout the show, Nagate is shown as a normal young man despite being isolated. He is selfless, compassionate, caring, courageous, and has tons of potential to become a savior as result of his training with his grandfather\u2019s Guardian simulator. What he possesses though is more than just his raw skills but his instinct and will to fight for what he believe in. He believes in hope and strives to survive with the people he built connections with. And from that, he also puts others\u2019 well-being before himself. One of those characters is Izana Shinatose, a transgender human. Among others he befriends includes Shizuka Hoshijiro and Yuhata Midorikawa, both who shares a relationship with him among all the chaos. It\u2019s from these relationships that expands on Nagate\u2019s character as we get to know him more. The show cleverly balances the atmosphere of despair and humor with their interactions. More so though, we see more of Nagate\u2019s personality as well and can appreciate him more as a person. But as a Guardian Pilot, he also possess a sense of pride. This is clearly seen through his rivalry with Norio Kunato, another top trainee. However, Kunato is a cold man and looks down others for their inferiority. His idealism and ego often defines his character as the complete opposite of Nagate.  \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s clear that the show has its mysteries relating to almost everything whether it\u2019s the Gauna, humanity, or just reality itself. It invites questions with twists, some more startling than others. For example, the captain of the Immortal Ship Committee is seen throughout the show as a mysterious individual with a mask that hides her face and possible intentions. Some of her missions and abilities to command the crew has led to death and sorrow. Other mysteries recalled in the series includes the methods that humanity uses to survive. Science has broken boundaries like never before with concepts such as human cloning, photosynthesis, and asexual reproduction. And throughout the show, these concepts are explored in small yet fine details. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the pessimism, the show does have space for some heartwarming moments and even comedic scenarios. The show isn\u2019t designed for comedy but its humorous moments can unintentionally spawn laughter with its gimmicks. The more heartwarming moments include Nagate\u2019s relationship development with certain characters. Unfortunately at the same time, it also raises death flags for certain characters as no one is immortal. For Nagate, he must overcome the struggles of loss and deal with reality. Thankfully, he has friends and they create memories that serves as his motivation to annihilate the Gauna. Some of these friends even develop a seemingly romantic interest towards Nagate, which seems to be depicted as an innocent story. On the other hand, the show also crafts tragedy from such connections with devastating executions completed with aftermath sorrow. Needless to say but it\u2019s a tough world they are part of now if Gauna co-exists with humanity.\\n\\n\r\nAs a show of the sci-fi and mecha theme, expect abnormal attributes to be inserted in. For the Gauna, they are epitome of abnormality. They are the executioners of humanity and are designed to as such. But besides their outer appearance, secrets and their fighting methods can raise eyebrows especially after seeing the results of their powers. Meanwhile, we have the way humanity fights back through the usage of Guardian, powerful mechanized weapons of war. It\u2019s explained that Hyggs particles are the power source for these weapons. There are also various typed of these weapons as we see them in action. In fact, Nagate becomes a pilot for one such prototype where he demonstrates why he is an ace pilot. And by presenting itself with both sides with these themes, the show becomes like a professor for science fiction along with the previously mentioned concepts. \\n\\n\r\nThe show looks strong overall on paper but does suffer a few bits when it comes to overall execution. Some bits of the story (while adapted well) is still predictable. The comedy and drama sometimes seems forceful and inappropriate, sometimes executed at the wrong moments. Some concepts and ideas of the show also feels static when it comes to originality. The way it adapts itself often sees humanity as the underdog. It becomes sometimes aching to see just how much humanity can take with hopelessness. The Gauna themselves lacks characterization because of their mindless depiction. For all we know, the show only throws hints about their true origins but still leaves its true visage in the dark.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork could be a hit or miss for viewers. Polygon Production studio crafts the unusual structure of the series with CGI. The artwork in fact defines the way Sidonia should be like with its starships, character designs, and Gauna. It would take some hard time to get used to but overall fitting for a post-apocalyptic era. The starships doesn\u2019t just look technological but also innovatively crafted with solid details. Character designs shows most characters with albino features but this is because of the photosynthesis, a concept that is honest to the show. When it comes to horrific, the Gauna species speaks for itself with their design. Their fetus-like structures with tentacle, size, and eldritch behavior all paints the grim image of death; a common theme that is present throughout the show serving as a heart breaker. But overall, the action is fluid with intensity and delivers solid coordination when it comes to its warfare. The various mecha designs shows how advanced technology has come with a high-key consistency.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is no pushover either when it comes to delivery. The OP and ED songs aren\u2019t just for show but also illustrates creativity. The eerie-like tones is like an echo for the overall thoughtful concepts. And to get the job done, it also goes to lengths to heighten interest with its OST. Indeed, the background music and soundtrack is vigorous with energy. On the other hand, character voice mannerisms is moderate. There\u2019s nothing too special about any of the character tones. Perhaps the Honoka sisters are worth mentioning since their voice contradicts their age. But that\u2019s not really a big drawback considering its stellar voice mannerisms overall when it comes to duty to action. During climatic and emotional scenes, characters\u2019 voices goes full throttle to demonstrate empowerment and credibility to this show\u2019s reality.\\n\\n\r\nNihei transcends his thoughts and formulates them into this show, one that I find to be captivating. The characters are dynamic, the story is thought-provoking, and the overall premise has high class style. As a sci-fi adventure mixed with all sorts of little ideas and concepts, it\u2019s something to take in all at once. But the show cleverly divides and conquers with these ideas as if it\u2019s all planned. The result is a success and thrilling piece of work, one that is memorable not for its deaths and tragedies, but for its fascinating journey with appreciable thoughts.\\n",

            "content": "Sidonia no Kishi, I heard a lot about this series and how it's similar to Attack on titan. So me as a big fan of attack on titan came in to see what all the hype and talk about this series was about.\r\nStory 6/10. The story is about Gauna a alien race that has destroyed the solar system and now humans are on  the brink of extinction and are now forced to live in giant seed ships. Nagate Tanikaze is the main character of this series, he's entrusted to pilot the legendary unit known as Tsugumori. So basically this series is a survival serieswith some Gundam themes in it. The only similarity between this series and attack on titan is that humans are on the brink of extinction just like the other thousands of anime that has this theme. But I guess people reference attack on titan since it's a very popular series and that's a easier way to make more people become a ware of this series by mentioning its similarities between them.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6.5/10. At first I was very turn off by the art, but I gradually got use to it and it wasn't as bad as I initially thought. The cgi looks good when it comes to space battles. I'm still not a big fan of using cgi in anime period, but this wasn't too bad imo. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10. Now the sound this was one of the things I like in the series, the soundtracks are really good and memorable and it made the fight scenes even more intense. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5/10. Now for me the characters were very flat and bland, so when a character died I didn't care at all, the main characters and most of the supporting characters are cut out cardboard boxes, the cgi also made the characters have a robotic like movement which made the characters look even more bland, \"beep beep I am a robot\" What's worst is that everyone looks identical and I know that it's because of the cloning machine, but that still doesn't change the fact that I mix up characters sometimes because they all have similar facial expression, the only thing that makes everyone looks different is the hair style/colour of hair, and I'm talking both male and female it doesn't matter give the main character a female hairy style and he will look like a girl.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10. With all the negatives, I still enjoyed this series a lot and it was really good, I enjoyed the action and the harem romance as well. ;)\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10. Overall it was the good soundtrack and enjoyment is what made this series a 7/10 for me. This series doesn't bring anything new to the table, but the series did a fairly good job in what it was aiming at, and that's to be a good survival series. So my final thoughts give this series a shot even if you don't like the cgi still give a shot, the cgi isn't as bad as you will initially thought. Thnx for reading my review if you have made it this far.\\n",

            "content": "High-concept sci-fi is hardly a rarity in anime, in fact it is integral to the medium as a whole. Apocalyptic struggles for the survival of humanity are also quite common, and giant robots are synonymous with anime. However, as well tread as these elements are, they can still feel fresh and like they\u2019re on the cutting-edge when done correctly. Knights of Sidonia, adapted from a manga by acclaimed author Tatsomu Nihei of the same title, is a prime example for this. If taken on their own, the plot elements that the show uses are not breaking any new ground, and yet they come together tocreate an exciting sci-fi actioner that is distinctive despite all the familiarities it shares with other shows of its genre.\\n\\n\r\nA large part of what makes Knights of Sidonia so distinct is the thoughtful and well realized sci-fi world that Nihei has created. It is a world rife with super-science, enveloped in deeply intriguing mystery, and haunted by monstrous abominations. There are tons of fascinating concepts which are interwoven together to make a well detailed and convincing post-apocalyptic universe in which the last of humanity is forced to live on a space colony, and must defend itself against inhuman beings called the Gauna.  Grand scale tragedies and dire circumstances have forced significant change onto mankind; both social and biological. Humans have been genetically modified to photosynthesize after a food shortage crisis. People wear belts that latch onto designated safety ramps in case of gravity instability. Some humans are born gender neutral, only becoming male or female after finding a mate. Mankind lives in a constant state of war, essentially under military rule.  Anti-war protesters claim that if mankind lays down its weapons, the Gauna will leave it be. Every concept adds a little more detail which makes the world all the more believable, and very little feels extraneous or unnecessary. That said, the world is so expansive in detail that there are many things which are left vague or unexplained, but since the show\u2019s 12 episodes only covers a small portion of the on-going manga\u2019s material, these will presumably be elaborated on in later instalments.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself follows Nagate Tanikaze, a human who has lived most of his life in the underground tunnels of Sidonia and has not been genetically modified to photosynthesis, but none the less is a talented pilot. After arriving on the surface, Nagate joins Sidonia\u2019s military force as he learns more about Sidonia and its society. In a way, Nagate acts as an audience surrogate, as much of what we learn about Sidonia is revealed through his experiences. His relationships with his fellow pilots and other citizens of Sidonia is also at the emotional core of the show. His instant friendship with gender-neutral Izana, attraction to fellow pilot Shizuka Hoshijiro, the one-sided grudge Norio Kunato holds against him, all of these give the show a human aspect that keeps the show from being as cold and concept driven as it could have been. This is especially true when the plot takes some tragic turns that put Nagate through the emotional wringer. Nagate himself might not stand out as wholly unique when compared to other protagonists in the mecha genre, the talented misfit pilot is a well-worn trope, but he is a likeable lead that is easy cheer for, and human enough to relate.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is, more or less, equally well developed. Izana in particular is a very likeable character, though admittedly is suspiciously feminine for a character that is supposed to be gender-neutral. Her relationship with Nagate is refreshing and highly endearing, and her developing crush on him is frankly adorable. Shizuka is just as endearing, being a sweet and unimposing love-interest for our protagonist. Kunato is decidedly a self-righteous jerk (putting it lightly considering the consequences of his actions), but has enough of a human-edge to make him understandable in his disdain for our protagonist, though by no means justified. Though not explored very deeply, the Gauna are an appropriately intimidating and mysterious menace that mankind rightfully fears. Even many of the bit players get just enough personality to get attached, though in some cases it is pretty apparent that they are there to be fodder for the body count.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot moves at a brisk pace, not wasting much time, if any at all. Veteran screenwriter Sadayuki Murai and the rest of the writing team must be commended on adapting Nihei\u2019s expansive sci-fi world to the screen without relying too heavily on information dumping, while giving ample time for relationships to develop and having a substantial amount of action. Admittedly all is not perfect, with some plot points being overly obtuse, and some of the character interactions and dialogue can feel kind of phoned in. There are times when the show feels too close to being a harem, with so many of the girls taking an interest in Nagate, which does feel pretty unnecessary and a bit like a power-fantasy. However, as a whole, the writing here is rather impressive stuff.\\n\\n\r\nOn a technical standpoint, Knights of Sidonia looks pretty good, but certainly has its rough spots. Most of the technical shortcomings come from the show\u2019s use of CG models, usually for the battles, but sometimes for character animation as well. By no means is the CG work here bad, in fact it is rather good for a series. However, it does have its bouts of awkwardness from time to time, and they are rather noticeable. By in large, the CG mecha battles fair better than when the CG is used for character animation. Granted, the former has moments of awkwardness, but at its worst the latter can be emersion breaking. That said, K\u014dbun Shizuno\u2019s direction compensates for most of the show\u2019s technical deficiencies. He knows how to frame a shot, and can choreograph action extremely well. All of the show\u2019s action sequences and other set-pieces are executed cleanly and in spectacular fashion; never getting too busy or muddled. It also has a small amount of fan-service added in, albeit slyly using the concept of photosynthesis, but it is telling that we never see any of the men stripping naked to photosynthesis. The music by Noriyuki Asakura is fitting for a space sci-fi and used well to support the show\u2019s content, though the battle music will likely be what you will remember the most.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Knights of Sidonia is an expertly made sci-fi mecha action show. It does have a fair amount of shortcomings, most notably the sometime awkward CG animation and the rather needless harem element. Nor does the show really break any knew ground, for as polished and well thought out as it is. However, the show has a surplus of positives that compensate for its flaws. The sci-fi setting is rich and well detailed. The characters are interesting and likeable, for the most part. The plot is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally engaging, and the action is exhilarating. It might not be the absolute best of the mecha genre, but it is certainly an impressive addition.\\n",

            "content": "Knights of Sidonia is a science fiction action series adapted from renowned mangaka Nihei Tsutomu. The series - which is arguably more accessible than the authors other work - has received a favourable adaptation from Polygon Pictures, though unfortunately certain elements fail to avoid banality.\r\nThe narrative is an enthralling romp through outer space and Sidonia - the series' giant intergalactic city, complete with Tsutomu's famously captivating architecture - though at certain points it loses its way (or rather, its appeal) as it devolves into a generic harem. This element could have been better portrayed - perhaps displaying the characters' desperation in trying to find loveduring their limited lifespan in such a dangerous time - but instead takes a more comedic route, which does well to balance the series and prevent it from becoming a lifeless action set piece, and is also a more light-hearted way to explore and develop the cast, but unfortunately it does little to challenge convention. It\u2019s not as big an issue as it could have been, as the plot is often redeemed through its pace and sci-fi focus, not to mention some twists, which keep the plot fairly engaging, but overall it suffers at times from rather formulaic writing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are relatively conventional, with each displaying little more than a single trait. These familiar archetypes don't necessarily ruin the series, but their motivation and back-stories become - at times - rather predictable. Like the harem elements, it would have been nice to see more originality, though certain plot twists do sometimes steer the characters away from their moulds. The main character - Tanizake - is at times stupidly aloof, but the cast are an interesting ensemble, despite cliches.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art is vastly computer generated, the style of which has been fully embraced by the anime staff. Unlike the lapses in originality in the plot and characters, the art style is incredibly fresh and surprisingly befitting of Tsutomu's work. Certain scenes are a little choppy, but the animation staff have brought Sidonia to life and animate some wonderful scenery, along with extremely compelling, hyper-fast action sequences, with good use of slow motion here and there. The cinematography could have been better executed, however; the setting offers many opportunities for some wonderful, breathtaking shots, which are unfortunately overlooked most of the time. There are also a couple of repeated shots and the unfortunate inclusion of some lewd, questionably framed fan-service snaps, which are completely unnecessary. Overall, however, the animation and art is admirable and a welcomed change to the norm.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is an absolute stand-out element. Sound design and editing isn't often incredibly notable in anime, with feature-length productions often displaying the best in the business, but it's nailed to a tee in Knights of Sidonia. A high quality sound system or headphones are recommended; the sound team create some thoroughly immersive, cinematic work, with the sounds of the monstrous Gauna and the impressive mechs being of particular note - brilliantly produced and edited. The music, too, is very immersive and blends extremely well with the visuals and tone of the series. The sound and music are exceptional; entirely worthy of praise.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Knights of Sidonia has remarkable style, but flawed substance. It\u2019s an enjoyable series with great potential, but a formulaic tale with a narrative and characters seen all too often. Nevertheless, it\u2019s entirely worth watching, with the art style and sound production being huge redeeming qualities. If you can overlook the conventional aspects, you may well hold out for the second series, which - here\u2019s hoping - brings the substance in line with the style.",

            "content": "This review may contain minor spoilers. \r\nKnight of Sidonia is a raw diamond of the recent anime seasons. General fan could be easily dispelled away by the show's odd art style and initial confusing story (at least in my case). However, once you get past the use of 3-D drawing and the lack of narrative, Knight of Sidonia (for short KoS) will amaze any patient audience with its frank manner of storytelling and brilliant space atmosphere.\r\nWhat set KoS apart from other space/mecha  anime series is that it is not giving a damn in pleasing fan with flashy battles, human living in beautiful spaceships or\"escaping\" stories that one can insert himself into. KoS tells its unique story and stays honest to the terror of space with tons of deaths, brutal horrors, and human ugliness when forced to survive in a confine place.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10:\\n\r\nIt's the same struggles of humanity against alien race in space. What make KoS outstanding is that it is a shine example of a show-not-tell story. Rather than having a narrative explaining all the underlying problems, audience are forced to learned the story bit by bit in conversations, character actions and background environments throughout the 12 chapters. For instance, audiences in one chapter may notice production scarcity by human adaptation to photosynthesis, and population crisis through the introduction of a third gender in the next. Along with lots of unexpected deaths and dark twists, KoS is bound to keep the story fresh and captivating. \\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10: \\n\r\nIf familiar with well-known and eye-candy space shows such as Space Ship Yamato or Macross Frontier, audiences may have difficulty adapting to the 3-D and \"bland\" colors of KoS. I personally find the 3-D character designs somewhat dull and lifeless. The background colors sometimes disjoint and seem like a mess. On a positive side, the series portrays extreme details in its mecha, weapons, human community and especially the vastness of space. In KoS, space ships and even the monstrous alien races are minor to the endless darkness of the universe. The 3-D drawing also effectively made the light of the stars seem much real and distant, rather than some simple white dots in a black background.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10:\\n\r\nThe thumping machine sound of the big space ship engines, the grand fanfare when all the mechas joined together in a rescue mission and the soft music while some characters enjoy a romantic moment could give a chill to any fan. While I do not find the OP/ED particularly special, the care KoS took in its background sound is significant. Personally, these background sounds gave me a sense of a \"big, cold and quiet\" space.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10:\\n\r\nKoS characters cast is very distinguish from other space shows in that they are generally mentally strong and willing to accept the cruel fate of space. When their comrades die, some completely break down, some lament quietly and keeps moving on with determination. There will not be a scene of bumping fist in a wall or long remember speech to induce cheap sympathy. While there are some generic archetypes, most characters are memorable with their own sense of pride and belief.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10:\\n\r\nI immensely enjoy Knight of Sidonia.  Its show-not-tell technique treated me like a smart audience, forced me to think. Its realistic space concept, for example, what moving keep moving in space, made other shows childish. KoS does not comfort when we learn some inconvenience truth about human struggles. Though there are some mesmerizing peaceful scenes, death remains death, space cruelty remains as horrify as it can be. And by staying true to itself, KoS has respected me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWith the recent anime seasons, some shows start out strong with beautiful animation and promising plots. Somewhere along the line, they compromised their stories for a comfort twist, avoiding conflict for the sake of entertaining a wider range of audiences. Thankfully, Knight of Sidonia does not resort itself to these means.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you are looking for a mature, dark, and realistic space series, Knight of Sidonia is a must choice. The characters inner struggles are great, the background sound will give you goose bumps, and most importantly it tells you an unforgettable tale. I sincerely hope anime fans or general movie watchers could give this show the success it needs for a second season.\\n",

            "content": "Imagine a Sci-fi epic with the tenacity of becoming something of a psychological journey into the deep unknown. Many movies have captured the feelings of being out in the far reaches of interstellar travel in space rockets, or in this case, giant mechas. With the help of talented writers, that dream can become real, in order to prove to the viewers that it can retain that sci-fi glory and be significant to the genre. All it takes is something like Sidonia no Kishi to show that the genre is far from dead.\r\nWhat sets Sidonia no Kishi at the top spot along with many great spaceepics in anime is how beautifully crafted it sets up the premise. Rich, with a well-developed lore that organizes the tension that we feel with the dilemma that the characters are facing. It\u2019s clear from how the writers put all of their effort into crafting a great narrative to capsulize the drama to make us root for the characters, rather than apathetically rooting for their deaths. This includes genuine tragic emotion and a heart pounding climax that puts it on overdrive to appease the action fans. Even with its shallow ending that feels rather abrupt, that is only a minor issue to a story that has more things going for it on a larger scale.\\n\\n\r\nNot only does Sidonia no Kishi nail it on the narrative aspect of story, but it enriches itself with a very deeply layered lore that feels relatively fresh. Sure, humans who are near extinction going out to settle in open space may not be \u201cnew\u201d in the strictest sense. However, Sidonia no Kishi offers a slightly different approach to this setting. Rather than make a narrative that\u2019s over encompassing with large factions and political strife, it\u2019s more personal and first-person, following our hero Nagate. Through this approach, we have a relatively intimate experience with the characters and the story that helps navigate towards their dialogue and interactions with the world and other people. It\u2019s here where the show sets a nice bar pretty high for a genre that hasn\u2019t delved into this type of narrative, and doing it well no less.\\n\\n\r\nWhat it has to amount to is how the characters portray themselves in the narrative to have a huge impact. Unfortunately, only a few of them standout as accomplishing this. The few that do are the main protagonists, Nagate and Izana. This is the fact of how they have a nicely written bond towards the halfway point into the plot, but also how they develop overtime, whether it\u2019s their relationship or their own individual roles. Nagate is portrayed as dealing with the turbulent lifestyle of Sidonia\u2019s poorer sub-culture and his growth is developed gradually and with intelligence. Meanwhile Izana starts out as a plain-old character that will be the obvious love interest, but they actually take a few risks in being written as a guide for Nagate. She isn\u2019t just a love interest and nothing else, she has a hand in the development of Nagate and doesn\u2019t appear as useless to the show.\\n\\n\r\nSo what is wrong with the rest of the cast? Nothing entirely major, it just all comes down to how much of an impact they have in their individual presence, which only range from decent to below average. The obvious choice for decent is Hoshijiro and how the writers treat her tragic role. All that comes down to for the rest aren\u2019t that they are uninteresting, but all I can see in most of their archetypes are Characters A, B, C and nothing else. They don\u2019t issue more of a response other than just look at them as tools to forward the plot. However, once the tragedy settles in either character, it still gets a reaction, but that\u2019s only because of how well the atmosphere is created.\\n\\n\r\nWhere things get a little heated is the animation, particularly the CG-ness of Sidonia no Kishi. Following on the footsteps of the glorious CG shlock called, Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova, it decides to implement its animation into the CG format that had a divided reception in recent iterations of anime. However, unlike Ars Nova, the CG is actually well-made in this instance simply by the fact that the movements, for the most part, feel very fluid and smooth. Because this is set in a mecha environment, it does feel more appropriate implementing CG into the mix so that the artist can do more with what they are given. I wouldn\u2019t go far as to say it\u2019s groundbreaking, but it\u2019s as close to greatness as one could get from it.\\n\\n\r\nSince this is a mecha after all, it would be fair to critique the action sequences, since that\u2019s what most fans of the genre look forward to. For someone like me who hasn\u2019t delved into the genre as much as the next person, I found myself actually on edge throughout most of these sequences. This is thanks in no part to the animation and sound department and how intense they make the scenes, which are so kinetic and focused on what is going on. The final battle sequence alone garners needed praise to how greatly directed it portrays it with tight coordination and timing with how the characters try to overcome this dire dilemma. So if you have been waiting for an anime that is akin to past Gundam action sequences, this blows most of them out of the park.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, we don\u2019t get nearly enough anime that tries to attempt being basing around an intelligent story woven enough to where it\u2019s actually coherent, while also being entertaining to watch at the same time. While I won\u2019t consider this an instant sci-fi classic that many will appreciate for generations, it does have the hallmarks of leading some to treasure it. The two main leads definitely own their roles and are worth the watch for them alone. What will come of how they will continue this great trend and respect the source material, only time will tell. Either way, I\u2019m happy to wait for that inevitable continuation.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-\\n",

I'm a fan of good CG animation, but this was not it. The character design was okay - typical anime fare - but the characters were animated in this really choppy, static manner. Ugh. I tried to like it, but i just couldn't.\r\nThe overall story was interesting, and not having read manga yet, I'm interested to see where it goes. I like the main character's origin, however inconceivable it may be. I don't like the harem aspect of the story,though. I don't see why it needs to be there. It makes no sense to the story, it's distracting to no great effect.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's interesting, and I hear that Netflix is picking up the second season. I will watch it, but I'm not really expecting much.",

            "content": "Knights of Sidonia is an anime that pushes a hard sci-fi storyline mixed with elements of \"real robot\" mecha in exploring the Sidonia fleet's struggles against a mysterious alien threat in space that has nearly driven humanity to the brink of extinction. The major element of Sidonia that sticks out prominently is the meticulous detail it provides to showing off the world of the Sidonia space colony. The series devotes a great amount of effort in detailing varying elements to the civilization of the series as humans aboard Sidonia have undergone genetic engineering that provide them with differing abilities to adapt to the space colonyenvironment they live in that include utilizing cloning to increase population size and giving humans the ability to perform photosynthesis to reserve on food supplies. This meticulous detail also went into the mecha and technologies of the series as limitations of their capabilities, the zero gravity of space, potential for casualties and ammo/ energy reserves are factored into missions and battle tactics seen throughout the series a la past \"real robot\" titles like Gasaraki and Patlabor.\\n\\n\r\nThe other prominent element to Sidonia that sticks out is its high quality visuals. Milking use of 3DCG animation, the use of the technology helps to give more realistic detail to its character and scenery designs with subdued color tones to compliment the title's serious storytelling. Movement is very fluid throughout the series, best highlighted in showing off the realistic effects that gravity has on the human pilots and the intense action scenes that take place between the Sidonia mecha and the alien threat they are dealing with. The only setbacks with the use of 3DCG with Sidonia are that its use give character designs a somewhat plastic feel that can be rather noticeable in some camera angles and facial designs are poorly animated with limited range of expression.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the story and characters of Knights of Sidonia as a whole, the series is a bit on the generic side in these areas. Sidonia mostly relies on story elements and character archetypes typical of sci-fi titles to carry along the series and it doesn't really offer anything new for the genre that I might have already seen before. The gifted teenage pilot and uptight, jealous rival seen in the form of Nagate and Norio's chemistry has been a recurring character dynamic of past titles and this dynamic is rather shallow since both characters don't get much in the way of dimension or depth. This issue also applies to the majority of other characters seen throughout the series as they mostly exist to fill specific tropes found in sci-fi anime, from the doomed love interest (which the Gundam franchise milked enough for many of its titles) to the secret group of superiors having ulterior motives hidden from the majority of those within their ranks. The whole \"post-apocalyptic future where humanity struggles against an alien threat\" premise is also nothing new and Sidonia offers nothing new to let it stick out from other titles milking similar plots.\\n\\n\r\nThere were also some noticeable issues I took notice of with the anime's plotting. Due to the limited depth given to much of the cast, the character deaths seen lack any impact and Sidonia makes a half-assed attempt to force viewers into caring for them by having characters aboard the Sidonia bond with Nagate on the episode they die in. One particular incident that happens during the middle of the series is a bit dumbfounding in how the perpetrator behind it can get off scot-free without any repercussions nor suspicion of it thoroughly investigated by the military, leading to a pointless case where Nagate is reduced to a depressed state and lashed out against by the Sidonia populace. I also have to wonder where in a series that is as meticulously realistic with its sci-fi depiction as Sidonia is, why it has a talking bear with a robotic arm in the form of Lala Hiyama as there is nothing revealed over why she appears as she is while everyone else aboard the Sidonia is human in appearance. In addition, the series ends inconclusively as there are lingering mysteries unresolved with several plot elements within Sidonia.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Sidonia is pleasing enough with its animation and implementation of realistic elements for its sci-fi, the series doesn't offer much new to the sci-fi and mecha genres that have been seen from similar titles of its ilk, which made it hard for me to care much for the story and characters it had to offer up. Action and sci-fi fans may enjoy this if they overlook this problem. But Sidonia had me feeling like I seen the stuff it offered up too many times at this point in my 13 years of anime fandom.",

The pilots are all idiots, especially early in the series. None of them follow orders. Whenever a fight starts it turns into chaos as they all do random things. In fact, that\u2019s basically how their whole society works. Most of the jeopardy in this show comes from people's stupidity, which makes it very hard to understand how they managed to avoid blowing themselves up for so long. \r\nIn particular, I found it hard to suspend disbelief during an incident where a quick look at missiondata would have instantly clarified what happened. Obviously these people are so advanced that they don't need to record flight data of any kind. Wait, are we meant to assume that they just don\u2019t care? After all, it\u2019s not like suffering severe losses in combat is a big deal or anything. It\u2019s not like it matters if a mission ends in utter failure and the big world-ending monster comes and kills everybody. Hey, where did the monster go? Maybe it fell into a plot hole while the main character was unconscious. Ah, well, it doesn\u2019t matter anyway. Time to shut off the brain. There\u2019s a second season coming, you know.\\n\\n\\n",

When there\u2019s something at stake. When there\u2019s tension. When the main characters could actually lose and fuck up.\r\nThis is my biggest issue with the superhero genre. You know Superman or Wolverine are never going to lose. If they die they\u2019ll just come back because nobody stays dead in comics. Your toast getting burnt is more inconvenient.\r\nWhen you know your heroes will win or won\u2019t die then any excitement is gone. What\u2019s the point of watching? It can still be entertaining, but it would bemuch, much better if there was tension.\\n\\n\r\nThis is what I liked about Knights of Sidonia. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve felt excitement and fear whenever the characters fought the enemy. The aliens are very strong. The characters\u2019 mecha suits don\u2019t do shit. To kill the aliens you need to use a very specific weapon and to hit them in a very specific body part.\\n\\n\r\nEvery time they went out to battle there would be casualties. Someone always died. It could\u2019ve been a minor characters or some cannon fodder, but someone died.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, the sci-fi setting is interesting, and I\u2019m a sucker for interesting worlds.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s stopping me from giving this a fresh, fucking 9 is that the characters aren\u2019t that engaging. It\u2019s ironic considering how much tension the show can build.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is boring. He\u2019s never excited or ask questions for us to learn about the world. The minor characters are a little shallow, but they work enough. Also, the CGI animation makes everyone look the same. It was jarring at first, but you get used to it. And you\u2019ll maybe find someone you like to get invested with.",

            "content": "Ok, I don't write many reviews, but considering how bad this anime was I feel it can't be that hard. \r\nThis was probably spelled out in the plot synopsis, but Knights of Sidonia (or \u30b7\u30c9\u30cb\u30a2\u306e\u9a0e\u58eb) is a science fiction, mecha action anime where humans have fled Earth a thousand years ago on a giant space ship called 'Sidonia' fleeing from the threat of unknown origin known as the 'Gauna'. Protagonist Nagate Tanikaze in search for food stumbles out of the vast inner workings of Sidonia and out into the open society where he is selected to be a Guardian Pilot defending Sidonia against the Gaunathreat. \\n\\n\r\nI've never been a fan of CGI in anime since it definitely isn't Japan's strong suit (though I commend them for trying something new) and they'd be better off just sticking to what they already do best and focus on other aspects of storytelling. So I came into this anime with a hesitant mindset, but I soon got entranced really quickly when the first space battle happened. The 'gauna' are awesome in my opinion. They can take many different forms and can evolve to increase their efficiency at countering human technology. On top of that, they are horrifying. Not the most scary thing I've seen, but I wouldn't want to tango with any of those. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough, I think what captured me most about the beginning of this show was space; everything space. I love space, and anything that takes place in space is sure to capture my attention. Also, I was impressed how the concept of space wasn't just a setting, but was also a factor in the story and the battles. And the life on the titular space ship 'Sidonia' was well thought out as well with interesting differences in society affected by advanced technology such as human photosynthesis that allows a independence of food and water for a week. The main character didn't grow up in the society of Sidonia and as a result he can't photosynthesize. I liked this distinction in his character. And herein lies the first problem: that's the only thing I like about this character. \\n\\n\r\nSo for the first episode, Knights of Sidonia is going in a pretty good direction in my opinion. And honestly, this had me tricked for the next few episodes. It took me awhile before I realized it steadily got worse. It started when I realized that this anime is almost the exact same plot as Attack on Titan (\u9032\u6483\u306e\u5de8\u4eba). First off, a main character that doesn't know his origins joins the military when the enemy reappears after a hundred years without a sighting. The main protagonist quickly becomes the spearhead of the military when he is discovered to be a special asset that could almost single handedly win the war; a war in which humanity has been waging as long as they can remember and threatens the very existence of humankind. A war with an enemy that is bent on the complete eradication of humans without determinable rhyme or reason. Humans built a special base to defend and counteract against the enemy that is led by questionable leaders that could prove just as much a threat as the outside enemy. \\n\r\nThe baseline of this story is extremely similar to Attack on Titan with different setting, characters, and plot twists (very poor and predictable plot twists I might add).\\n\\n\r\nSo I started comparing the two, and I began seeing very clear distinctions in what Knights of Sidonia was lacking. As I said before, I despise the protagonist. Not just because he is awkward, annoying, bland, and holds no true character flaws besides being socially inapt, but mainly because I have no idea why he is fighting the gauna so passionately. In Attack on Titan, Eren held a very powerful grudge against the Titans because of his past experiences with them.This is what allowed us to sympathize and connect with Eren as a character. Nagate has absolutely no past experiences with the gauna and suddenly because somebody just simply asked him to become the 'Knight of Sidonia' or some prophetic hero destined to save Sidonia he becomes determined to eliminate all of the gauna and dedicate his life to protecting the society and people that he 'loves'. When you read it, that would at least make a little sense, but keep in mind that he decided this after being in this society for only a few days! How can he claim to love something he hardly as any knowledge of? Worst of all, whenever he is not fighting gauna or speaking with Sidonia's commander, he seems to completely forget all that. The motivation that is meant to drive him as a character hardly affects him at all, and I end up forgetting what his role is in the story. And I'm going to go so far as to say that I forget what the story even is about anymore whenever their not fighting gauna.\\n\\n\r\nThis show doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be an awesome scifi, or if it wants to be a mediocre harem. Honestly, the harem aspect takes 75 percent of the screen time, and almost all of it is completely useless. There was only one time when the harem part of the story affected the actual plot. I attribute this to a misunderstanding of (or just pure apathy to) the concept of character development. Knights of Sidonia seems to interpret that as 'sexual tension' and 'love drama'. To make it worse, sometimes this sexual tension/love drama is so poorly written and cheesy that I started to think I was watching a porno. Dialogue is bad, characters are one dimensional and unappealing, and its just overall disappointing to see this interesting society getting plague by these cardboard cutouts of overused character archetypes. The protagonist is terrible, the female characters are worse because they are head over heels for this guy for absolutely no other reason than a 'because I said so' attitude by the author, and this other male character who seemed to be important had promise since he was the protagonist's opposite and was willing to make morally ambiguous decisions to get his way; however, when he started to see some of the effects of his decisions, he quickly became a wimp, quit being a pilot, and was kicked out of the story never to be relevant again. Honestly, the best character in this show is the Benisusume, whose identity is a spoiler so I won't reveal anymore than that except that this character has only about four lines that are almost exactly the same. And the worse part of this is the portrayal of women. I know that the anime industry usually targets adolescent boys who can't focus on anything that doesn't have breast the size of jupiter, but this is ridiculous. Also, this show can't possibly be intended for young boys, because it clearly attempts to make itself dark and gritty like Tokyo Ghoul or Attack on Titan but can never stick to that tone. So I don't know what audience the author is writing to and what he is trying to say with his story. It sounded like mindless babbling to me. \\n\\n\r\nI don't talk too much on the story in comparison to the characters, but that is because the story was interesting and held promise; though, it was quickly overshadowed by every other terrible thing that it completely lost its appeal. I watched this show to the end in hopes of rekindling that promise and maybe the story would once again have the majority of the screen time, and I was given at least a fraction of reward with a season finale in both seasons that were done fairly well and proved that if this author had simply stuck to what he does best instead of this harem garbage this could have been a good thing. \\n\r\nNot to say that I don't think harems can be good. I have watched a lot of harems and enjoyed a few. I'm just saying this is a very bad one. \\n\\n\r\nSince sound is an area of critique on this site, I'll mention a little something about that. There isn't much that stands out about the soundtrack and nothing leaves an impression except for the opening credits. I imagine that these openings were meant to be exciting and with a hint of patriotic-like pride just as the Attack on Titan openings were. However, these fail terribly at replicating this. The animation for the opening is literally shots from the rest of the show dreadfully edited together with a very underwhelming song choice that lacks energy, emotion, and impact. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I didn't enjoy Knights of Sidonia despite the very interesting concept behind it simply because it didn't allow me to enjoy it by shoving other things I don't care about in my face and trying to get me to accept them. This show really has an identity crisis, trying to wear the clothes of a harem comedy while also trying to be a gritty, realistic scifi. If a harem comedy anime wants me to take it seriously and realistically, then it either needs to not be a harem comedy or try harder; a lot harder. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, don't watch this show. It is horrible, and it is the definition of what is wrong with the anime industry that can't seem to let go of its horrendous cliches and characters archetypes. When will they start trusting us to be interested in a story that doesn't have kinky sexual comedy and breasts the size of jupiter?",

            "content": "Sidonia no Kishi is a must-see for science-fiction fans. It can be easily overlooked because of appearances, however, I can assure you that if you give it a chance you will be very pleased with the story, the pace, the characters and the overall development.\r\nThe plot is not an entirely new scenario, it is about survival of humanity in deep space. However, it is delivered in such a beautiful way with good, fast pace, enticing plot twists, romance, meaningful drama, even some comedy and cliffhangers at the end of each episode, that stimulate your interest to learn more about where all this goes. The characterdevelopment is good, nevertheless, you may find the characters themselves being a bit blunt at times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it feels that there is non-stop action from the beginning till the end. One thing to note about the plot is that this first season is building up the foundations for the second season. Hence, some question-marks that will be raised here will be answered later on.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is very good and memorable, especially the OP and theme song and it is used perfectly to match and enhance the intensity of the scenes. The CGI art feels unique and mature and adds a lot to the seriousness of the plot but it also enhances the mecha combat scenes tremendously. All in all, a very enjoyable watch and an interesting plot that flows very well without stagnation and will retain your interest till the end.\\n\\n\r\nAll sci-fi, survival, space, mecha and action fans should not miss this one! Even if you are not a big fan of CGI, give it at least 3-4 episodes and I am sure your opinion will change! It is a great watch and a must see that you cannot miss!",

            "content": "Sidonia no Kishi i rate 10 of 10. It 'been long since i watched something with such enjoyment.\r\nI often rate some good animes 8-9 ball, but 10 i give almost never. But this is exactly that situation.\r\nThis is, a perfect mecha story. Mecha_as_it_should_be. And one of the finest pieces of action/adventure anime at all(much better than, e.g., overrated by dumb kids \"Attack on Titan\").\r\nLet me explain why at every point:\r\n1)Atmospherous  music,  not only the exatly compositions, but the timing and appropirateness of sound to very each moment is perfect.\r\n2)No cryings, stupid emotions for half the episode in \"IWILLKILLYOUEVILLLLAAAAAA\" style, and also no reflectionsfor half of episode.\\n\\n\r\n3)Main charecter. He is not slow, stupid, pervert or something. His emotions are a bit typical for these genre main characters, but, again - there is no annoying roraring, crying, childy enragements and so on for half of each episode, no things that ruined many other good animes.\\n\\n\r\n4)The story is being told very softly - typically in animes of same genere, its like - deep \"coolstories\" told in the beginning, then, in middle of series:-\"To hell the lore, lets enjoy how wide protagonist can open his mouth!\". Here, in Sidonia no Kishi, they make it the different way.\\n\r\nThey explain almost nothing in the beginning, but in the end, you will understand every character purposes and what's what and for what purpose in this world is. If you have ability to think, of course.\\n\r\nBattle scenes are really unpredictable in comparison to other similar genere animes.\\n\r\nYes, MC(main character) will not die, but all other things is very deceicive and unsetted to you before you watch it.\\n\\n\r\n5)Animation and art. Could be better, could be worse. Not a masterpiece ofc, but not ugly overall and suits these series atmosphere well.\\n\\n\r\n6)Characters - could be better too, but...no stupid&slow protagonist. No persky moe. No lolitas.\\n\r\nNo stupid troublemakers and other fanservice characters. This anime is serious, solid - and so do it's characters, with very few uncritical exceptions. Seriosity without boring long \"coolstories\", comedy elements without stupidity, almost a harem, but not harem...such way of things are very rare thing in modern animes.\\n\\n\r\n7)...and...no, i don't think i need to continue.\\n\\n\r\nIn total:\\n\\n\r\nWant to watch some good plot adventures anime, but tired of stupid troublemking protagonists, dull stories and too much fanservice, and don't want to be bored with too much unimportant lore? Then Sidonia no Kishi is your choice. I strongly recommend this one to everyone of my cast, the people who think they \"overgrown\" watching cartoons&sure that modern anime is degrading(and its true). But not in this title. This is what the anime exatly should be imo.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to the ones who understand, i'm sure i convinced you to watch it. For others, let me prepare a departure ceremony for you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cAttack on Titan in space?  Well\u2026. not quite.\u201d\r\nI was terribly hesitant to delve into another dystopian anime with mechs, as I feel it can be one of the most overused plot elements in any anime, but at the strong recommendation of a friend I tuned into Sidonia no Kishi (Knights of Sidonia).  What I found was a CGI-infused space epic of sorts, which I even later found out to be compared often to Attack on Titan.  It\u2019s a show I wanted to like, but turned out to bland in a lot of ways, hindering its overall successes.  \r\nKnights of Sidonia takesplace years after unidentified creatures known as \u201cGauna\u201d invaded Earth, forcing the population to seek refuge elsewhere in space aboard Sidonia, a massive, self-supporting deep space vessel.  Tanikaze, the MC in this series appears to have been living in the depths of Sidonia his entire life, practicing blowing Gauna away in a spacefighting simulator created by his Grandpa.  His grandpa passes away and is left to venture out into the real world for the first time.  Honestly, he ends up adjusting to never interacting with other humans before quite well.  For initially unknown reasons, the captain of the Sidonia military takes a liking to Tanikaze and puts him into pilot training.  There also seems to be an instant harem element present, as the academy\u2019s vice president and other random girls blush at every glance from Tanikaze\u2026 of course they would.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest gripe I have with the story in Knights of Sidonia is the actual lack of plot depth.  You see battle after battle with lots of pilots dying, but no one seems to know anything about the Gauna or where they came from.  You would think that after several centuries of fighting with these things\u2026 that SOMETHING would\u2019ve been uncovered, just a little clue.  Also, we come to find that there is an immortal council devised of Sidonia residents who seek immortality and provide general guidance to their figurehead, who just so happens to be the military captain.  The only problem is, their formation is alluded to but never fully explained.  And, to make it better\u2026 there\u2019s also a chick that is a bear for some reason.  In a ship full of humans, just one bear\u2026. with a robotic hand.  Nice.  You think at one point Tanikaze would ask\u2026 \u201cHey Lala, why is it that you\u2019re a bear?\u201d  Nope, of course it\u2019s normal.\\n\\n\r\nTanikaze literally seems like the only intelligent pilot in existence.  Despite the amazing amount of preparation that the other members of the military had to fight against the Gauna, their best four pilots get wiped out almost instantly in their first battle.  Seems legit.  To top it off, by the third battle or so the mediocre pilots are slaying ten to twenty of the Gauna at a time.  All the battles seem to play out the same way as well, which makes the detailed and flashy battle scenes less impressive.  Don\u2019t worry though, Tanikaze will end up pulling through in the end! The story isn\u2019t all bad though, the relationship between Tanikaze and Hoshijiro blossoms well, and the outlook of the dystopian society is well written\u2026 just not enough to make up for the blandness.  I also didn\u2019t notice a large amount of similarities between AoT and KoS, except for the low amount of people remaining from Earth and some unexplained entity that they\u2019re fighting to survive against.  I feel that archetype is presented in other animes as well.\\n\\n\r\nAn even weaker part of Knights of Sidonia is the characters and the writing of dialogue.  Tanikaze is the stereotypical haremy badass of a protagonist, but his inner emotions and history are never really expounded upon at all.  It would help me relate to the character more if these areas were explained\u2026 at least a little bit.  Due to the heavy CGI used in the animation style, it can also be tasking and difficult to decipher proper body language of the characters themselves.  If it weren\u2019t for the random blushing redness on their faces, a comment could honestly be taken way out of context.  The character\u2019s movements made me slightly nostalgic to older shows like Reboot on Toonami, as they seemed to all move similarly.  If you listen closely you can hear their bleeps and bloops.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are so boring that when they die, I feel apathetic to the whole thing.  If that\u2019s the effect they were going for, they hit the nail on the head.  I did feel Kunato got some development as the series went on, and I actually kind of felt bad for him from the stress consuming him from being a pilot and throwing Tanikaze under the bus regarding Hoshijiro.  It\u2019s a spark of some development but not much.\\n\\n\r\nSome people say the CGI makes or breaks viewer\u2019s experience with KoS, but I\u2019m not quite onboard with that mentality.  Sure, it is rather hard to watch at first, because it is different.  And yes, it does detract from the static conversations between characters, but the action scenes are actually beautiful and well constructed.  And they\u2019re plentiful in the anime, which made me actually anticipate what would come next.  The sound is also pretty good.  The opening theme does remind me of Attack on Titan with its fanfare, and the sound effects of the Gardes are cool to say the least.  The OST in general never lacked, and the dramatic openings of battles were orchestrated very well.  Voice acting is alright, but nothing noteworthy.  I had a hard time differentiating between some of the female cast.  \\n\\n\r\nAside from the plot holes and unoriginal or bland characters, I did enjoy KoS.  It was nonstop action which allowed me to watch almost the entire series in one sitting.  The special effects were great, and I am a sucker for space mechs with oversized guns.\\n\\n\r\nKnights of Sidonia could\u2019ve been improved in several ways, and I think the CGI art style may have been a bit too ambitious for the writers to counterbalance with the plot and characters.  Although I enjoyed it, I don\u2019t think it would be for everyone.  If you have some time to kill, and you\u2019re looking for a lot of fast paced action, this one is for you.  Thanks for reading! \\n",

            "content": "Sidonia no Kishi is truly a marvel. When I began the first episode and laid my eyes on the CGI, I felt a bit underwhelmed and my opinion  began to waver on the show; However, SnK soon made me realize that I could have never been so wrong and I'm glad for that. Sidonia no Kishi is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi anime where everyday mankind lives in fear of being decimated, but continues to survive on an enormous ship known as Sidonia. There struggle is against an alien-species known as the Gauna which have brought humanity to its knees before and the only thing betweenthem and Sidonia are the pilots of the Gardes(mechs) whom protect Sidonia. This setting is not necessarily new, but the way it is handled and presented  can only be said to be top-notch.\\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10):\\n\r\nThe story sets itself for excitement, thrills and edge of your seat action which is all done masterfully in SnK. Considering humanity could be on the brink of being destroyed on a daily basis there should really never be a dull moment and there never was. Even at times when the scene was supposed to ease the tension or be a bit more heart-warming not once did it lose my interest. The sci-fi played a huge role when showing off technological advancements and it's thanks to this and the anime's emphasis on it which made it only that much more interesting. Every single moment had its intensity, the plot would constantly mesmerize you with excitement, but evens it out superbly with some comedy and scenes to ease the tension before throwing you back in the action again. The story has been done many times over, but not a lot could match up with what Sidonia no Kishi brought to the table.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10):\\n\r\n The world is brought to life using CGI which is what gave me the first impression that it would be underwhelming. In-fact, I felt rather unsettled seeing the CGI, but moving forward giving the anime a chance I realized there would be no Sidonia no Kishi without it. The CGI is used masterfully for every scene and whenever it was time to buckle up and fly into the heat of battle the action was on a completely different level from anything else thanks to it. While it did take some getting used to for when we were simply watching our characters walking around, it became no problem soon enough and well worth it to just see the Gardes in action. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10):\\n\r\nThe sound completely exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend if you have a pair of fantastic headphones, use them. The quality of the sound during the encounters versus the Gauna were some of the best I have ever heard. Once I put on my headset and listened, I was completely immersed. The engines roaring, weapons firing and so-on, you could tell the studio payed especially close attention to the details and it was phenomenal. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter(8/10):\\n\r\nThe characters in SnK were very interesting. While I cannot say they were completely original they each had unique characteristics to separate themselves from most other characters. Each character evolved in his or her own way and it was fantastic to see some of the interactions between them after the course of some events had taken place. It's really thanks to the sci-fi setting that allows for such diversity among them and while you may not appreciate every character; Each character we're introduced to have their own role in the story and I cannot deny that it's thanks to what can be created within the sci-fi setting which makes each of them only that more intriguing. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10):\\n\r\nSidonia no Kishi had done everything completely right in my eyes when it came to entertainment. Every episode had a huge significance and would leave you with an aching appetite for more. Every time the Gardes had flown off into battle I was completely overjoyed with excitement and even in the more relaxing scenes I was still just taken aback by all the twists the plot had taken along with the progression. For an anime to be able to succeed in capturing the audiences attention every single episode is a grand feat.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10):\\n\r\nSidonia no Kishi is an amazing anime that should not simply be overlooked. The CGI, while may take some getting used to for some, is an integral part of the anime and those whom give it a chance will see why. Even for those with a dislike of mecha I'd recommend this to as the major focus on character interactions, fantastic sound and breath-taking action all put into one package makes this one of the greater Sci-fi mecha anime out there to look out for. Out of all 12 episodes there was not one that was uneventful and it continued strong from start to finish. \\n\\n\r\nSo what are you waiting for pilot? Suit up, it's time for the Knights of Sidonia to move out.",

            "content": "So when I first found out that there was not only a manga but also an anime with the same title (yet spelled differently) as my favorite song by Muse, I felt the need to check out what it was. So of course when I first started watching the show I was pretty pumped to find the same kind of popcorn action that I would get while watching a film like the Star Wars saga or reading a novel like Ender's Game. I did get the show that provided me with that kind of action, but that's just it; I got EXACTLY what I expectedand I wasn't blown away in any way. Knights of Sidonia is definitely that kind of blockbuster spaceships and explosions fun you would want in an anime, but it doesn't bring anything new to the table and ends up being a steaming mishmash of vapid and under cooked sci-fi tropes that were cool to watch but didn't light me up in any way along with a plot that moves to fast to fit everything in. However I am willing to overlook some of the production values that I consider subjectively bad if I get around to watching the recently planned season 2 or find copies of the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe first aspect of the show that I was rather taken aback by was the use of 3D animation instead of traditionally drawn shows. I was really turned off by the stale looking world and characters at first, but I think it honestly grew on me and most reminded me of the corridors of the video game Dead Space (minus all the bone-cracking gore and alien enemies that experience provided) and the seed ship Sidonia, all its inhabitants, and the overall look of the set pieces has an interesting, pristine feel to them and it almost felt like it could be the real interior of a space vessel. In addition to that, the space battles were not only the best aspect of the show, but they looked really cool too, and I as the viewer really got the feel that the Gardes, pilots and commanders were not only fighting the Gauna, but the massive size of Sidonia and space itself. An area where the animation took somewhat of a nose dive would be in the case of the characters; they all look eerily the same, and it was highly jarring dealing with several characters that looked the same at first. Granted I could tell who Tanikaze was (but that was mostly because of JYB's voice), but until the characters were singled out and focused upon more, Yuhata and Norio were simply Green-Haired Girl and Sephiroth Wannabe. Then Hoshijiro got introduced with Izana to quickly follow, and there was a moment where I thought they were the same person, and so seeing them both on the screen at the same time was more jarring than it should have been.\\n\\n\r\nSo while the animation was here and there and the fight scenes were awesome, many elements of the plot and characters suffer from being cardboard cutouts and aforementioned sci-fi staple tropes that didn't make Knights of Sidonia stand out as much as I had hoped it would. But first lets talk about the good. Whenever the characters get lost or they encounter a Gauna, they need to make the trek through space using just the right strategy to get back or they won't survive, and they made up for some pretty intense moments in the show that weren't the amazing fight sequences. The other interesting aspect that the show expressed was how much pressure the humans were under in order to squelch and survive such as photosynthesizing instead of eating and putting on gravity belts whenever the ship turned were both useful and interesting elements to the show. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, most of the plot and character personalities I feel were overused and have been done better in other places. Tanikaze is a very staple main character, and the fact that he's this 'chosen one' pilot that can use the 'best garde' really has no purpose other than the fact that he's the underdog and we as the audience were supposed to root for his struggle, I guess. The other thing that bothered me about his character is that he got in trouble trying to steal food and got caught meddling in top secret government stuff and didn't get prosecuted for either. This is why the 'chosen one' trope that is Tanikaze is didn't make the drive of the show interesting; he's boring, rigid and doesn't develop much at all. As for most of the other characters are those kinds that only have one personality trait or motive: Yuhata is smart, sweet, and likes Tanikaze. Hoshijiro: same, Izana: Same. Then there's the endless stream of Red Shirts that like Tanikaze because he's Tanikaze, and the immortal council members who are mysterious and cold for the sake of being mysterious and cold, and Norio is the cranky bitter guy. I'm listing them as such because I feel like that's really all there is to them. When they die there's no weight. When there's love, it's forced. When there's action, they just support Tanikaze. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course while I adore sci-fi and the bright flashy robot and alien fights were the point of no return where the analytic part of my brain goes to die, the rest of what makes sci-fi interesting; cloning, ship building, prosthetic robot stuff, talking animals and human preservation technology, it's all cool, but it has to have a point. I ended up having more questions than I had answers about stuff the show made up itself, and for the use of sci-fi tropes that I had seen before, I had seen them being used in a better way. Some of the new stuff that was brought to the table was the aforementioned (and well done) photosynthesis vs. food idea, and the giant talking bear. Why? Why is it here? Why is the immortal council so cold? Why are they trying to hide the Gauna-human hybrid from Tanikaze even though they told him what it was when they asked? I had far too many questions left unanswered, and it put a damper on the enjoyment of the show as good writing to me is all about what to write and when. Of course all of this can be overlooked if the manga or season 2 will fill in some of these blanks for me.\\n\\n\r\nEven if had a lot of complaints resulting in my opinion on Knights of Sidonia being average to good, it was still an enjoyable watch if you do like sci-fi. Sure a lot of the show can be criticized but if you're there to watch it for fun and not for analysis, I would highly recommend it to you. However if you're looking for something more that robot and alien flashy colors and lasergun fights with a pinch of melodrama and scifi cliches inbetween, I'd stay away.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "When certain premises in anime are overused without variation they're quickly labeled as \"run of the mill\".. Like dystopian with mecha. Because of that many anime try to change minute details regarding the setting or premise to stand apart. However, if something normally considered \"run of the mill\" is executed with proper care it can be seen as rather refreshing. Knights of Sidonia is a rare case, not quite falling towards being called mediocre nor does it fall towards refreshing. Rather it all depends on the individual to make the judgement call. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nSet in the distant future, the story takes place upon a spaceshipwhere the lone surviving civilization of humanity live in a stagnant state of unrest due to the attacks of giant ominous creatures known only  as \"Gauna\". These creatures are rather interesting as they seem to have the ability to mimic the action and appearance of things they encounter, giving them an eerie presence as the series progresses. \\n\r\nDue to these frequent attacks by the Gauna the story never feel bogged down to a slow paced narrative. This makes for good binge watching material as your curiosity pushes you to one episode after the next. Despite the pace being powered by propane the tone of the series is all over the place. The story goes from \"Shingeki no Kyojin in space\" to \" let's build a harem\" at a drop of a hat . This can be very off putting at times but it's slowly resolved back to an even tone towards the show's midpoint.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nit's hard to judge the art for this anime. It's a mixture of both CGI and cell shaded animation. The CGI is rather jarring upon 1st encounter but quickly becomes tolerable as you become immersed in the show's setting. On normal occasions if someone were to tell me to watch a show composed entirely of CGI, I would probably think \"well this is gonna be some ugly shit\" but in this case it works. In fact I think it's safe to say that the CGI gives Knights of Sidonia it's special signature. This is especially true for the fight sequences. However when the focus are on the characters, their movements feel artificial and stiff. It's also obvious that recycled footage were used during the launch sequences and team formation. The flaws are too noticeable to ignore and ultimately impedes on the score from being higher.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music score is virtually nonexistent. It's all muddled together with very little difference separating them. Only standout were the ones played during Gauna encounters.. The opening song however is one worth noting. I has an orchestral tone while still being rather tranquil, making it one that you simply can't skip. Voice actors all perform their roles with no hiccups but there wasn't any standouts that come to mind.  The only other standout being the sound affects pertaining to the lasers (heigus cannon), thrusters and other devices used. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all a dismal mess. None of them receive any decent characterization. Our main character is basically another \"self insert\" protagonist with little personality to speak of and is good at everything he does. Basically he's the vanilla of most MCs coming out today and can easily be replaced by one of many other series with no difference noticed.\\n\r\nthe antagonist Kunato, upon 1st introduction seemed 1 note. Before he even muttered a word you already know he was going to be the 'arrogant, rich, short tempered douche '.. But surprisingly he becomes the only character with decent characterization. As the show progresses it also becomes easier to  sympathize with him. \\n\r\nAnd finally a plethora of females! Because what's a harem without some right? But seriously there's only two female characters worth mentioning and that's Izana & Hoshijiro (Izana being non gender but I digress). Both of which have no real characterization beyond being 1 dimensional archetypes but they do get a more screentime than the rest.\\n\r\nOH YEAH! there's also a talking bear with a robot hand that we never get a proper explanation for but we'll ignore that lol\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\ndespite this show's numerous flaws it's an enjoyable watch for those looking for a sci-fi popcorn flick. The characters were nothing special but the story carried it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is made to be enjoyed by the casual viewing masses and is an easy watch. However seasonal anime fans will notice the overused tropes and archetypes in a heartbeat and that might be the deciding factor on whether they like it or think it's mediocre. Either way the series to the very least was entertaining with little down time to speak of and can be easily finished in one sitting. With that in mind I recommend giving this one a go.",

            "content": "The pledge:\r\nWe, the knights of Sidonia.\r\nPledge ourselves as one united galaxy protectors.\r\nRegardless of gender, race or religion.\r\nTo protect the outer space from destruction.\r\nThat is caused by Gauna floating in outer space.\r\nSo as to achieve peace, happiness and progress for \r\nour universe.\r\nI came up with the pledge which describes best of the Knights of Sidonia. This anime is directed by Kobun Shizuno from Polygon Pictures and it is an adaptation from Nihei's manga \"Knights of Sidonia\". As you may know, Nihei Tsutomu specializes in cyperpunk genre manga like for example, BLAME & Biomega. \r\nThis anime reminds me of Gravity the movie. \r\nSTORY (9):\r\nThe story takes placein the future where Earth is destroyed by monsters called Gauna, and mankind has to flee from Earth. Each Gauna has a core that is protected by the placenta, and once the placenta and core are destroyed, the Gauna's body disintegrate. In order to stop the Gauna, \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a similar idea of Attack on Titan where human is on the verge of extinction. \"Attack on Titan\" villains are  the Titans while \"Sidonia no Kishi\" villains are the Gauna. \\n\\n\r\nSpace is big and beautiful but it can be frightening.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime also shows that not all tactics can work. Just like in any action anime, some tactics can have benefits and problems. Just like gravity can sometimes affect the performance in the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nI did like the way how the story handles the characters. Imagine surviving in outer space with no oxygen or air or water like in episode 5, where Tanikaze & Hoshijiro are stuck in outer space. In order to survive in outer space, you need oxygen tank and lots of food and drinks supply. \\n\\n\r\nI also liked how the robots form in circles to show union. \\n\\n\r\nART (10):\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people are annoyed by the usage of CGs. However, this anime managed to handle the CG well, making the animation look stellar. This anime uses 3D animation.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (10):\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, I loved the opening song \"Sidonia\" by Angela. This song plays a tone that displays courage and bravery. I also liked the ending song \"Show\" by Eri Kitamura. The ending song plays in a rock and roll tune.\\n\\n\r\nAngela also sang some songs like the opening of Coppelion \"Angel\". Eri Kitamura is also a voice actresses in some roles she has done like Eve from NEEDLESS.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (9):\\n\\n\r\nI liked the way how they handle the characters. At least they never show me any annoying traits.\\n\\n\r\nTanikaze Nagate was the type of character who always try to do his best no matter what happens. I thought at first he was like a wimp, but surprisingly he really develops as a character from there on.\\n\\n\r\nIzana Shinatose is also a decent character who also tries to help Nagate as possible as she can. \\n\\n\r\nLala Hiyama was the type who also supports Nagate just like a real mother. \\n\\n\r\nShizuka Hoshijiro was pointless as a character. All she does was just have a bond with Nagate that I didn't feel attached to.\\n\\n\r\nKunato was the character I despised the most because he treated Nagate like crap in episode 7. However, he didn't affect me in the slightest.\\n\\n\r\nI wished that some characters have more screen time and back story so that at least they can stand out in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (9):\\n\\n\r\nApocalyptic anime always highlight tragedies in real life events. One of the example is Sidonia no Kishi. I also wished that some characters have more screen time. In fact, I wanted to know more about how Gauna existed.\\n\\n\r\nI also heard that season 2 would be announced. At least season 2 would give enough time to develop the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSidonia no Kishi has great morale like surviving in space is never easy because in space, there's no oxygen and low gravity. Gravity can affect people's movement.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is non-stop fun, the soundtrack is amazing, stellar animation, great character development. That's why I give it a 9/10. If you are into sci-fi action, you will love this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI will never feel bored after watching this anime.\\n",

            "content": "Nihei Tsutomu is one of the leading manga authors of the cyberpunk genre. With his amazing artwork in pieces like Biomega and BLAME!, it was obvious he was on a roll by the time he got into creating Sidonia no Kishi. The problem became apparent though, in his most acclaimed piece BLAME!. People had a hard time comprehending the story. Though BLAME! was experimental and had beautiful atmosphere and artwork, the adaptation did not turn out well. This created a stigma with whether or not Nihei\u2019s work could be adapted well. When a new animation studio decided to pick up Nihei\u2019s newest work, Sidonia noKishi, people were interested. The hesitation lay in the medium of animation, CGI. Now the question remains as to whether Sidonia no Kishi would wipe of the stigma brought on by the BLAME! Adaptation, or just follow in its footsteps.\\n\\n\r\nKnights of Sidonia is a futuristic cyberpunk piece which is Nihei Tsutomu\u2019s niche. The big change from BLAME! to this piece though, was the story. The story, rather than leaving it more ambiguous, was more straightforward. The human race is forced into space due to a predatory and mysterious enemy called the Gauna. In order to defend the last bastion of the human race, an enormous space ship called Sidonia, the humans make use of giant mechs called Guardes to do battle with the Gauna.  This setting allows for more dramatic turns to take place as humanity scrambles to face off against an enemy they know hardly anything about. The technology is advanced, allowing for interesting views upon population control and reproduction\u2014along with the scientific breakthroughs with a certain energy called, Higg\u2019s Particles. This energy is in fact a real thing, and not out of the realm of possibility. However, proper utilization of it will not be achievable for many years to come. It is evident that a lot of research went into the creation of the way of life on the ship of Sidonia. The Guana alone have a mystique behind them that keeps your interest as you witness them grotesquely evolve during battles. With all this captivating lore aside, there is a lot of explanation which takes time to get through. However, this does not hinder the pacing, which is a really good thing because it allows you enjoy the story along with fleshing out their lifestyle.\\n\\n\r\nThe majority of the plot itself is character driven, and the environment takes a backseat to some more trivial problems that help flesh out the main cast. The melding of both the situation at hand and the character\u2019s personal struggles is well played out, with little to no hiccups. Between the intense battling at times though, it seems a little too lax for my taste. Let\u2019s say you are on a mission where you lose twenty five lives in the process and instead of mourning, you go to the beach or a festival. I know it\u2019s to take away the stress of everyday life, but if that is going to be done, I don\u2019t want to have a smaller struggle happen while they are on break. Just little nitpicks on the story. All in all, it has a solid base to segue forward from here into the next season.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve already stated that the plot is more character driven than complex, but in order to do this successfully you need to have a dynamic cast. Tsutomu did this beautifully; through each relationship and each battle, the main cast continues to grow and become more realistic. Though making a cast too realistic could cause them to be boring, these characters did not have this trouble. Each character had quirks that allowed you to easily distinguish between them, even with the infinite amount of clones that are pilots. The clones show that despite being genetically similar, their experiences are what shape them into who they are. Though there are a few odd ducks here and there that makes you pause for a second, like the talking bear, all in all the cast meshes together well. The lead character is far from uninteresting, in fact, he is probably the most interesting character (besides one of the possible love interests, Izana). The cast are like everyday people and you can understand the emotions that they experience. This is war, and they are soldiers, not happy-go-lucky high school students, and they act like it.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is forgettable at times but is always ambient. It truly meshes into the beautiful atmosphere created by Tsutomu and Polygon Pictures. The song worth mentioning in full is, of course, the opening song. The opening is describing the thought process of those out there fighting the Gauna. They are soldiers, they are not only fighting for themselves, but also so that others may have a future. Even if they die out there, they will have given it their all. It even has a different feel than other openings and sounds like a war chant which pumps up the viewer each time they watch. \\n\\n\r\nNow here we get to the sketchy part of the anime, the animation. Now I know Polygon Works is an upcoming studio and this is their first anime, but it actually wasn\u2019t entirely bad as many people say. While at times, it is a detriment when you are trying to figure out who is who with the lighting at times, it also has a decent amount of pros. The grungy textures of the buildings give them a broken down feel, setting the atmosphere for the times. Things sometimes seem more polished, which makes them lose that same appeal. For example, the ship has been in commission for hundreds of years, it shouldn\u2019t be in pristine condition anywhere. The Gauna look demented and terrifying and the action sequences are really well done. For a first time studio, it was pretty good CGI. \\n\\n\r\nKnights of Sidonia is my favourite piece from Nihei Tsutomu. Though it is hard getting all the nuances in his drawing into an animated format, they did a great job. The characters were as strong as I remember them from the manga. The gravity of the situation is mediocrely communicated compared to the manga, but the overall atmosphere is very cyberpunk, playing well to its genre. While BLAME! might not have made a great impact, Sidonia no Kishi certainly showed us that there is a capability to adapt Nihei\u2019s masterful artwork and story off of the page.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8.9\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.2\\n\r\nMusic: 7.8\\n\r\nAnimation: 7.5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8.4\\n\r\nOverall: 8.4\\n\r\nEdited by: PhantomTigers, imabooterfly\\n",

            "content": "Imagine a world, waking up every day, and realizing that you could be exterminated any moment. In the world of Sidonia no Kishi, that\u2019s a common trend for every single human who are still alive. The primary cause of this are the Gauna, alien extraterrestrials that have devastated humanity into near distinction. As the show takes place in an apocalyptic future, a journey with Sidonia no Kishi will be one of the dark ages. \r\nThe brainchild of the series and idea is Tsutomu Nihei, known for his other manga works such as Blame and Biomega. In Sidonia no Kishi, he spawns the idea of sci-fiand packages it with war themes. For instance, humanity is at war against the mysterious Gauna. Their means of survival depends on a generation skip known as the Sidonia. Since Earth have been annihilated, there\u2019s little hope besides working together in unity for survival. We get the very sense of despair with our characters as they live in near hopelessness. One particular character named Nagate Tanikaze stands out as a top ace in the series as result of simulator training from underground. But one day, he comes out from the layers of Sidonia and witness reality.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the first opening moments of the show, it\u2019s easy to tell that humanity is in a path of despair. The fact that their previous home planet Earth no longer exists serves a testament for their solitude. But for what\u2019s worth, the show still depicts humanity as a fighting group, resilient and with articulate sense for payback. The show illustrates this with Sidonia being the most prominent ship, perhaps because the others have been gone for over eight centuries. With Sidonia though, the show portrays them as the sole resistance. Calling them knights is probably a better term that fits with the title of the show by translation \u2013 Knights of Sidonia. It\u2019s important to realize the show reveals secrets and plot twists relating to Sidonia and the population itself. Startling twists tells stories and controversies gets people talking.\\n\\n\r\nReality bites Nagate as he realizes how grim it is. Throughout the show, Nagate is shown as a normal young man despite being isolated. He is selfless, compassionate, caring, courageous, and has tons of potential to become a savior as result of his training with his grandfather\u2019s Guardian simulator. What he possesses though is more than just his raw skills but his instinct and will to fight for what he believe in. He believes in hope and strives to survive with the people he built connections with. And from that, he also puts others\u2019 well-being before himself. One of those characters is Izana Shinatose, a transgender human. Among others he befriends includes Shizuka Hoshijiro and Yuhata Midorikawa, both who shares a relationship with him among all the chaos. It\u2019s from these relationships that expands on Nagate\u2019s character as we get to know him more. The show cleverly balances the atmosphere of despair and humor with their interactions. More so though, we see more of Nagate\u2019s personality as well and can appreciate him more as a person. But as a Guardian Pilot, he also possess a sense of pride. This is clearly seen through his rivalry with Norio Kunato, another top trainee. However, Kunato is a cold man and looks down others for their inferiority. His idealism and ego often defines his character as the complete opposite of Nagate.  \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s clear that the show has its mysteries relating to almost everything whether it\u2019s the Gauna, humanity, or just reality itself. It invites questions with twists, some more startling than others. For example, the captain of the Immortal Ship Committee is seen throughout the show as a mysterious individual with a mask that hides her face and possible intentions. Some of her missions and abilities to command the crew has led to death and sorrow. Other mysteries recalled in the series includes the methods that humanity uses to survive. Science has broken boundaries like never before with concepts such as human cloning, photosynthesis, and asexual reproduction. And throughout the show, these concepts are explored in small yet fine details. \\n\\n\r\nDespite the pessimism, the show does have space for some heartwarming moments and even comedic scenarios. The show isn\u2019t designed for comedy but its humorous moments can unintentionally spawn laughter with its gimmicks. The more heartwarming moments include Nagate\u2019s relationship development with certain characters. Unfortunately at the same time, it also raises death flags for certain characters as no one is immortal. For Nagate, he must overcome the struggles of loss and deal with reality. Thankfully, he has friends and they create memories that serves as his motivation to annihilate the Gauna. Some of these friends even develop a seemingly romantic interest towards Nagate, which seems to be depicted as an innocent story. On the other hand, the show also crafts tragedy from such connections with devastating executions completed with aftermath sorrow. Needless to say but it\u2019s a tough world they are part of now if Gauna co-exists with humanity.\\n\\n\r\nAs a show of the sci-fi and mecha theme, expect abnormal attributes to be inserted in. For the Gauna, they are epitome of abnormality. They are the executioners of humanity and are designed to as such. But besides their outer appearance, secrets and their fighting methods can raise eyebrows especially after seeing the results of their powers. Meanwhile, we have the way humanity fights back through the usage of Guardian, powerful mechanized weapons of war. It\u2019s explained that Hyggs particles are the power source for these weapons. There are also various typed of these weapons as we see them in action. In fact, Nagate becomes a pilot for one such prototype where he demonstrates why he is an ace pilot. And by presenting itself with both sides with these themes, the show becomes like a professor for science fiction along with the previously mentioned concepts. \\n\\n\r\nThe show looks strong overall on paper but does suffer a few bits when it comes to overall execution. Some bits of the story (while adapted well) is still predictable. The comedy and drama sometimes seems forceful and inappropriate, sometimes executed at the wrong moments. Some concepts and ideas of the show also feels static when it comes to originality. The way it adapts itself often sees humanity as the underdog. It becomes sometimes aching to see just how much humanity can take with hopelessness. The Gauna themselves lacks characterization because of their mindless depiction. For all we know, the show only throws hints about their true origins but still leaves its true visage in the dark.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork could be a hit or miss for viewers. Polygon Production studio crafts the unusual structure of the series with CGI. The artwork in fact defines the way Sidonia should be like with its starships, character designs, and Gauna. It would take some hard time to get used to but overall fitting for a post-apocalyptic era. The starships doesn\u2019t just look technological but also innovatively crafted with solid details. Character designs shows most characters with albino features but this is because of the photosynthesis, a concept that is honest to the show. When it comes to horrific, the Gauna species speaks for itself with their design. Their fetus-like structures with tentacle, size, and eldritch behavior all paints the grim image of death; a common theme that is present throughout the show serving as a heart breaker. But overall, the action is fluid with intensity and delivers solid coordination when it comes to its warfare. The various mecha designs shows how advanced technology has come with a high-key consistency.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is no pushover either when it comes to delivery. The OP and ED songs aren\u2019t just for show but also illustrates creativity. The eerie-like tones is like an echo for the overall thoughtful concepts. And to get the job done, it also goes to lengths to heighten interest with its OST. Indeed, the background music and soundtrack is vigorous with energy. On the other hand, character voice mannerisms is moderate. There\u2019s nothing too special about any of the character tones. Perhaps the Honoka sisters are worth mentioning since their voice contradicts their age. But that\u2019s not really a big drawback considering its stellar voice mannerisms overall when it comes to duty to action. During climatic and emotional scenes, characters\u2019 voices goes full throttle to demonstrate empowerment and credibility to this show\u2019s reality.\\n\\n\r\nNihei transcends his thoughts and formulates them into this show, one that I find to be captivating. The characters are dynamic, the story is thought-provoking, and the overall premise has high class style. As a sci-fi adventure mixed with all sorts of little ideas and concepts, it\u2019s something to take in all at once. But the show cleverly divides and conquers with these ideas as if it\u2019s all planned. The result is a success and thrilling piece of work, one that is memorable not for its deaths and tragedies, but for its fascinating journey with appreciable thoughts.\\n",

            "content": "Sidonia no Kishi, I heard a lot about this series and how it's similar to Attack on titan. So me as a big fan of attack on titan came in to see what all the hype and talk about this series was about.\r\nStory 6/10. The story is about Gauna a alien race that has destroyed the solar system and now humans are on  the brink of extinction and are now forced to live in giant seed ships. Nagate Tanikaze is the main character of this series, he's entrusted to pilot the legendary unit known as Tsugumori. So basically this series is a survival serieswith some Gundam themes in it. The only similarity between this series and attack on titan is that humans are on the brink of extinction just like the other thousands of anime that has this theme. But I guess people reference attack on titan since it's a very popular series and that's a easier way to make more people become a ware of this series by mentioning its similarities between them.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6.5/10. At first I was very turn off by the art, but I gradually got use to it and it wasn't as bad as I initially thought. The cgi looks good when it comes to space battles. I'm still not a big fan of using cgi in anime period, but this wasn't too bad imo. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10. Now the sound this was one of the things I like in the series, the soundtracks are really good and memorable and it made the fight scenes even more intense. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5/10. Now for me the characters were very flat and bland, so when a character died I didn't care at all, the main characters and most of the supporting characters are cut out cardboard boxes, the cgi also made the characters have a robotic like movement which made the characters look even more bland, \"beep beep I am a robot\" What's worst is that everyone looks identical and I know that it's because of the cloning machine, but that still doesn't change the fact that I mix up characters sometimes because they all have similar facial expression, the only thing that makes everyone looks different is the hair style/colour of hair, and I'm talking both male and female it doesn't matter give the main character a female hairy style and he will look like a girl.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10. With all the negatives, I still enjoyed this series a lot and it was really good, I enjoyed the action and the harem romance as well. ;)\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10. Overall it was the good soundtrack and enjoyment is what made this series a 7/10 for me. This series doesn't bring anything new to the table, but the series did a fairly good job in what it was aiming at, and that's to be a good survival series. So my final thoughts give this series a shot even if you don't like the cgi still give a shot, the cgi isn't as bad as you will initially thought. Thnx for reading my review if you have made it this far.\\n",

            "content": "High-concept sci-fi is hardly a rarity in anime, in fact it is integral to the medium as a whole. Apocalyptic struggles for the survival of humanity are also quite common, and giant robots are synonymous with anime. However, as well tread as these elements are, they can still feel fresh and like they\u2019re on the cutting-edge when done correctly. Knights of Sidonia, adapted from a manga by acclaimed author Tatsomu Nihei of the same title, is a prime example for this. If taken on their own, the plot elements that the show uses are not breaking any new ground, and yet they come together tocreate an exciting sci-fi actioner that is distinctive despite all the familiarities it shares with other shows of its genre.\\n\\n\r\nA large part of what makes Knights of Sidonia so distinct is the thoughtful and well realized sci-fi world that Nihei has created. It is a world rife with super-science, enveloped in deeply intriguing mystery, and haunted by monstrous abominations. There are tons of fascinating concepts which are interwoven together to make a well detailed and convincing post-apocalyptic universe in which the last of humanity is forced to live on a space colony, and must defend itself against inhuman beings called the Gauna.  Grand scale tragedies and dire circumstances have forced significant change onto mankind; both social and biological. Humans have been genetically modified to photosynthesize after a food shortage crisis. People wear belts that latch onto designated safety ramps in case of gravity instability. Some humans are born gender neutral, only becoming male or female after finding a mate. Mankind lives in a constant state of war, essentially under military rule.  Anti-war protesters claim that if mankind lays down its weapons, the Gauna will leave it be. Every concept adds a little more detail which makes the world all the more believable, and very little feels extraneous or unnecessary. That said, the world is so expansive in detail that there are many things which are left vague or unexplained, but since the show\u2019s 12 episodes only covers a small portion of the on-going manga\u2019s material, these will presumably be elaborated on in later instalments.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself follows Nagate Tanikaze, a human who has lived most of his life in the underground tunnels of Sidonia and has not been genetically modified to photosynthesis, but none the less is a talented pilot. After arriving on the surface, Nagate joins Sidonia\u2019s military force as he learns more about Sidonia and its society. In a way, Nagate acts as an audience surrogate, as much of what we learn about Sidonia is revealed through his experiences. His relationships with his fellow pilots and other citizens of Sidonia is also at the emotional core of the show. His instant friendship with gender-neutral Izana, attraction to fellow pilot Shizuka Hoshijiro, the one-sided grudge Norio Kunato holds against him, all of these give the show a human aspect that keeps the show from being as cold and concept driven as it could have been. This is especially true when the plot takes some tragic turns that put Nagate through the emotional wringer. Nagate himself might not stand out as wholly unique when compared to other protagonists in the mecha genre, the talented misfit pilot is a well-worn trope, but he is a likeable lead that is easy cheer for, and human enough to relate.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is, more or less, equally well developed. Izana in particular is a very likeable character, though admittedly is suspiciously feminine for a character that is supposed to be gender-neutral. Her relationship with Nagate is refreshing and highly endearing, and her developing crush on him is frankly adorable. Shizuka is just as endearing, being a sweet and unimposing love-interest for our protagonist. Kunato is decidedly a self-righteous jerk (putting it lightly considering the consequences of his actions), but has enough of a human-edge to make him understandable in his disdain for our protagonist, though by no means justified. Though not explored very deeply, the Gauna are an appropriately intimidating and mysterious menace that mankind rightfully fears. Even many of the bit players get just enough personality to get attached, though in some cases it is pretty apparent that they are there to be fodder for the body count.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot moves at a brisk pace, not wasting much time, if any at all. Veteran screenwriter Sadayuki Murai and the rest of the writing team must be commended on adapting Nihei\u2019s expansive sci-fi world to the screen without relying too heavily on information dumping, while giving ample time for relationships to develop and having a substantial amount of action. Admittedly all is not perfect, with some plot points being overly obtuse, and some of the character interactions and dialogue can feel kind of phoned in. There are times when the show feels too close to being a harem, with so many of the girls taking an interest in Nagate, which does feel pretty unnecessary and a bit like a power-fantasy. However, as a whole, the writing here is rather impressive stuff.\\n\\n\r\nOn a technical standpoint, Knights of Sidonia looks pretty good, but certainly has its rough spots. Most of the technical shortcomings come from the show\u2019s use of CG models, usually for the battles, but sometimes for character animation as well. By no means is the CG work here bad, in fact it is rather good for a series. However, it does have its bouts of awkwardness from time to time, and they are rather noticeable. By in large, the CG mecha battles fair better than when the CG is used for character animation. Granted, the former has moments of awkwardness, but at its worst the latter can be emersion breaking. That said, K\u014dbun Shizuno\u2019s direction compensates for most of the show\u2019s technical deficiencies. He knows how to frame a shot, and can choreograph action extremely well. All of the show\u2019s action sequences and other set-pieces are executed cleanly and in spectacular fashion; never getting too busy or muddled. It also has a small amount of fan-service added in, albeit slyly using the concept of photosynthesis, but it is telling that we never see any of the men stripping naked to photosynthesis. The music by Noriyuki Asakura is fitting for a space sci-fi and used well to support the show\u2019s content, though the battle music will likely be what you will remember the most.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Knights of Sidonia is an expertly made sci-fi mecha action show. It does have a fair amount of shortcomings, most notably the sometime awkward CG animation and the rather needless harem element. Nor does the show really break any knew ground, for as polished and well thought out as it is. However, the show has a surplus of positives that compensate for its flaws. The sci-fi setting is rich and well detailed. The characters are interesting and likeable, for the most part. The plot is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally engaging, and the action is exhilarating. It might not be the absolute best of the mecha genre, but it is certainly an impressive addition.\\n",

            "content": "Knights of Sidonia is a science fiction action series adapted from renowned mangaka Nihei Tsutomu. The series - which is arguably more accessible than the authors other work - has received a favourable adaptation from Polygon Pictures, though unfortunately certain elements fail to avoid banality.\r\nThe narrative is an enthralling romp through outer space and Sidonia - the series' giant intergalactic city, complete with Tsutomu's famously captivating architecture - though at certain points it loses its way (or rather, its appeal) as it devolves into a generic harem. This element could have been better portrayed - perhaps displaying the characters' desperation in trying to find loveduring their limited lifespan in such a dangerous time - but instead takes a more comedic route, which does well to balance the series and prevent it from becoming a lifeless action set piece, and is also a more light-hearted way to explore and develop the cast, but unfortunately it does little to challenge convention. It\u2019s not as big an issue as it could have been, as the plot is often redeemed through its pace and sci-fi focus, not to mention some twists, which keep the plot fairly engaging, but overall it suffers at times from rather formulaic writing.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are relatively conventional, with each displaying little more than a single trait. These familiar archetypes don't necessarily ruin the series, but their motivation and back-stories become - at times - rather predictable. Like the harem elements, it would have been nice to see more originality, though certain plot twists do sometimes steer the characters away from their moulds. The main character - Tanizake - is at times stupidly aloof, but the cast are an interesting ensemble, despite cliches.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and art is vastly computer generated, the style of which has been fully embraced by the anime staff. Unlike the lapses in originality in the plot and characters, the art style is incredibly fresh and surprisingly befitting of Tsutomu's work. Certain scenes are a little choppy, but the animation staff have brought Sidonia to life and animate some wonderful scenery, along with extremely compelling, hyper-fast action sequences, with good use of slow motion here and there. The cinematography could have been better executed, however; the setting offers many opportunities for some wonderful, breathtaking shots, which are unfortunately overlooked most of the time. There are also a couple of repeated shots and the unfortunate inclusion of some lewd, questionably framed fan-service snaps, which are completely unnecessary. Overall, however, the animation and art is admirable and a welcomed change to the norm.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is an absolute stand-out element. Sound design and editing isn't often incredibly notable in anime, with feature-length productions often displaying the best in the business, but it's nailed to a tee in Knights of Sidonia. A high quality sound system or headphones are recommended; the sound team create some thoroughly immersive, cinematic work, with the sounds of the monstrous Gauna and the impressive mechs being of particular note - brilliantly produced and edited. The music, too, is very immersive and blends extremely well with the visuals and tone of the series. The sound and music are exceptional; entirely worthy of praise.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Knights of Sidonia has remarkable style, but flawed substance. It\u2019s an enjoyable series with great potential, but a formulaic tale with a narrative and characters seen all too often. Nevertheless, it\u2019s entirely worth watching, with the art style and sound production being huge redeeming qualities. If you can overlook the conventional aspects, you may well hold out for the second series, which - here\u2019s hoping - brings the substance in line with the style.",

            "content": "This review may contain minor spoilers. \r\nKnight of Sidonia is a raw diamond of the recent anime seasons. General fan could be easily dispelled away by the show's odd art style and initial confusing story (at least in my case). However, once you get past the use of 3-D drawing and the lack of narrative, Knight of Sidonia (for short KoS) will amaze any patient audience with its frank manner of storytelling and brilliant space atmosphere.\r\nWhat set KoS apart from other space/mecha  anime series is that it is not giving a damn in pleasing fan with flashy battles, human living in beautiful spaceships or\"escaping\" stories that one can insert himself into. KoS tells its unique story and stays honest to the terror of space with tons of deaths, brutal horrors, and human ugliness when forced to survive in a confine place.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10:\\n\r\nIt's the same struggles of humanity against alien race in space. What make KoS outstanding is that it is a shine example of a show-not-tell story. Rather than having a narrative explaining all the underlying problems, audience are forced to learned the story bit by bit in conversations, character actions and background environments throughout the 12 chapters. For instance, audiences in one chapter may notice production scarcity by human adaptation to photosynthesis, and population crisis through the introduction of a third gender in the next. Along with lots of unexpected deaths and dark twists, KoS is bound to keep the story fresh and captivating. \\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10: \\n\r\nIf familiar with well-known and eye-candy space shows such as Space Ship Yamato or Macross Frontier, audiences may have difficulty adapting to the 3-D and \"bland\" colors of KoS. I personally find the 3-D character designs somewhat dull and lifeless. The background colors sometimes disjoint and seem like a mess. On a positive side, the series portrays extreme details in its mecha, weapons, human community and especially the vastness of space. In KoS, space ships and even the monstrous alien races are minor to the endless darkness of the universe. The 3-D drawing also effectively made the light of the stars seem much real and distant, rather than some simple white dots in a black background.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10:\\n\r\nThe thumping machine sound of the big space ship engines, the grand fanfare when all the mechas joined together in a rescue mission and the soft music while some characters enjoy a romantic moment could give a chill to any fan. While I do not find the OP/ED particularly special, the care KoS took in its background sound is significant. Personally, these background sounds gave me a sense of a \"big, cold and quiet\" space.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10:\\n\r\nKoS characters cast is very distinguish from other space shows in that they are generally mentally strong and willing to accept the cruel fate of space. When their comrades die, some completely break down, some lament quietly and keeps moving on with determination. There will not be a scene of bumping fist in a wall or long remember speech to induce cheap sympathy. While there are some generic archetypes, most characters are memorable with their own sense of pride and belief.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10:\\n\r\nI immensely enjoy Knight of Sidonia.  Its show-not-tell technique treated me like a smart audience, forced me to think. Its realistic space concept, for example, what moving keep moving in space, made other shows childish. KoS does not comfort when we learn some inconvenience truth about human struggles. Though there are some mesmerizing peaceful scenes, death remains death, space cruelty remains as horrify as it can be. And by staying true to itself, KoS has respected me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWith the recent anime seasons, some shows start out strong with beautiful animation and promising plots. Somewhere along the line, they compromised their stories for a comfort twist, avoiding conflict for the sake of entertaining a wider range of audiences. Thankfully, Knight of Sidonia does not resort itself to these means.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you are looking for a mature, dark, and realistic space series, Knight of Sidonia is a must choice. The characters inner struggles are great, the background sound will give you goose bumps, and most importantly it tells you an unforgettable tale. I sincerely hope anime fans or general movie watchers could give this show the success it needs for a second season.\\n",

            "content": "Imagine a Sci-fi epic with the tenacity of becoming something of a psychological journey into the deep unknown. Many movies have captured the feelings of being out in the far reaches of interstellar travel in space rockets, or in this case, giant mechas. With the help of talented writers, that dream can become real, in order to prove to the viewers that it can retain that sci-fi glory and be significant to the genre. All it takes is something like Sidonia no Kishi to show that the genre is far from dead.\r\nWhat sets Sidonia no Kishi at the top spot along with many great spaceepics in anime is how beautifully crafted it sets up the premise. Rich, with a well-developed lore that organizes the tension that we feel with the dilemma that the characters are facing. It\u2019s clear from how the writers put all of their effort into crafting a great narrative to capsulize the drama to make us root for the characters, rather than apathetically rooting for their deaths. This includes genuine tragic emotion and a heart pounding climax that puts it on overdrive to appease the action fans. Even with its shallow ending that feels rather abrupt, that is only a minor issue to a story that has more things going for it on a larger scale.\\n\\n\r\nNot only does Sidonia no Kishi nail it on the narrative aspect of story, but it enriches itself with a very deeply layered lore that feels relatively fresh. Sure, humans who are near extinction going out to settle in open space may not be \u201cnew\u201d in the strictest sense. However, Sidonia no Kishi offers a slightly different approach to this setting. Rather than make a narrative that\u2019s over encompassing with large factions and political strife, it\u2019s more personal and first-person, following our hero Nagate. Through this approach, we have a relatively intimate experience with the characters and the story that helps navigate towards their dialogue and interactions with the world and other people. It\u2019s here where the show sets a nice bar pretty high for a genre that hasn\u2019t delved into this type of narrative, and doing it well no less.\\n\\n\r\nWhat it has to amount to is how the characters portray themselves in the narrative to have a huge impact. Unfortunately, only a few of them standout as accomplishing this. The few that do are the main protagonists, Nagate and Izana. This is the fact of how they have a nicely written bond towards the halfway point into the plot, but also how they develop overtime, whether it\u2019s their relationship or their own individual roles. Nagate is portrayed as dealing with the turbulent lifestyle of Sidonia\u2019s poorer sub-culture and his growth is developed gradually and with intelligence. Meanwhile Izana starts out as a plain-old character that will be the obvious love interest, but they actually take a few risks in being written as a guide for Nagate. She isn\u2019t just a love interest and nothing else, she has a hand in the development of Nagate and doesn\u2019t appear as useless to the show.\\n\\n\r\nSo what is wrong with the rest of the cast? Nothing entirely major, it just all comes down to how much of an impact they have in their individual presence, which only range from decent to below average. The obvious choice for decent is Hoshijiro and how the writers treat her tragic role. All that comes down to for the rest aren\u2019t that they are uninteresting, but all I can see in most of their archetypes are Characters A, B, C and nothing else. They don\u2019t issue more of a response other than just look at them as tools to forward the plot. However, once the tragedy settles in either character, it still gets a reaction, but that\u2019s only because of how well the atmosphere is created.\\n\\n\r\nWhere things get a little heated is the animation, particularly the CG-ness of Sidonia no Kishi. Following on the footsteps of the glorious CG shlock called, Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio: Ars Nova, it decides to implement its animation into the CG format that had a divided reception in recent iterations of anime. However, unlike Ars Nova, the CG is actually well-made in this instance simply by the fact that the movements, for the most part, feel very fluid and smooth. Because this is set in a mecha environment, it does feel more appropriate implementing CG into the mix so that the artist can do more with what they are given. I wouldn\u2019t go far as to say it\u2019s groundbreaking, but it\u2019s as close to greatness as one could get from it.\\n\\n\r\nSince this is a mecha after all, it would be fair to critique the action sequences, since that\u2019s what most fans of the genre look forward to. For someone like me who hasn\u2019t delved into the genre as much as the next person, I found myself actually on edge throughout most of these sequences. This is thanks in no part to the animation and sound department and how intense they make the scenes, which are so kinetic and focused on what is going on. The final battle sequence alone garners needed praise to how greatly directed it portrays it with tight coordination and timing with how the characters try to overcome this dire dilemma. So if you have been waiting for an anime that is akin to past Gundam action sequences, this blows most of them out of the park.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, we don\u2019t get nearly enough anime that tries to attempt being basing around an intelligent story woven enough to where it\u2019s actually coherent, while also being entertaining to watch at the same time. While I won\u2019t consider this an instant sci-fi classic that many will appreciate for generations, it does have the hallmarks of leading some to treasure it. The two main leads definitely own their roles and are worth the watch for them alone. What will come of how they will continue this great trend and respect the source material, only time will tell. Either way, I\u2019m happy to wait for that inevitable continuation.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: A-\\n",

I'm a fan of good CG animation, but this was not it. The character design was okay - typical anime fare - but the characters were animated in this really choppy, static manner. Ugh. I tried to like it, but i just couldn't.\r\nThe overall story was interesting, and not having read manga yet, I'm interested to see where it goes. I like the main character's origin, however inconceivable it may be. I don't like the harem aspect of the story,though. I don't see why it needs to be there. It makes no sense to the story, it's distracting to no great effect.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's interesting, and I hear that Netflix is picking up the second season. I will watch it, but I'm not really expecting much.",

            "content": "Knights of Sidonia is an anime that pushes a hard sci-fi storyline mixed with elements of \"real robot\" mecha in exploring the Sidonia fleet's struggles against a mysterious alien threat in space that has nearly driven humanity to the brink of extinction. The major element of Sidonia that sticks out prominently is the meticulous detail it provides to showing off the world of the Sidonia space colony. The series devotes a great amount of effort in detailing varying elements to the civilization of the series as humans aboard Sidonia have undergone genetic engineering that provide them with differing abilities to adapt to the space colonyenvironment they live in that include utilizing cloning to increase population size and giving humans the ability to perform photosynthesis to reserve on food supplies. This meticulous detail also went into the mecha and technologies of the series as limitations of their capabilities, the zero gravity of space, potential for casualties and ammo/ energy reserves are factored into missions and battle tactics seen throughout the series a la past \"real robot\" titles like Gasaraki and Patlabor.\\n\\n\r\nThe other prominent element to Sidonia that sticks out is its high quality visuals. Milking use of 3DCG animation, the use of the technology helps to give more realistic detail to its character and scenery designs with subdued color tones to compliment the title's serious storytelling. Movement is very fluid throughout the series, best highlighted in showing off the realistic effects that gravity has on the human pilots and the intense action scenes that take place between the Sidonia mecha and the alien threat they are dealing with. The only setbacks with the use of 3DCG with Sidonia are that its use give character designs a somewhat plastic feel that can be rather noticeable in some camera angles and facial designs are poorly animated with limited range of expression.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the story and characters of Knights of Sidonia as a whole, the series is a bit on the generic side in these areas. Sidonia mostly relies on story elements and character archetypes typical of sci-fi titles to carry along the series and it doesn't really offer anything new for the genre that I might have already seen before. The gifted teenage pilot and uptight, jealous rival seen in the form of Nagate and Norio's chemistry has been a recurring character dynamic of past titles and this dynamic is rather shallow since both characters don't get much in the way of dimension or depth. This issue also applies to the majority of other characters seen throughout the series as they mostly exist to fill specific tropes found in sci-fi anime, from the doomed love interest (which the Gundam franchise milked enough for many of its titles) to the secret group of superiors having ulterior motives hidden from the majority of those within their ranks. The whole \"post-apocalyptic future where humanity struggles against an alien threat\" premise is also nothing new and Sidonia offers nothing new to let it stick out from other titles milking similar plots.\\n\\n\r\nThere were also some noticeable issues I took notice of with the anime's plotting. Due to the limited depth given to much of the cast, the character deaths seen lack any impact and Sidonia makes a half-assed attempt to force viewers into caring for them by having characters aboard the Sidonia bond with Nagate on the episode they die in. One particular incident that happens during the middle of the series is a bit dumbfounding in how the perpetrator behind it can get off scot-free without any repercussions nor suspicion of it thoroughly investigated by the military, leading to a pointless case where Nagate is reduced to a depressed state and lashed out against by the Sidonia populace. I also have to wonder where in a series that is as meticulously realistic with its sci-fi depiction as Sidonia is, why it has a talking bear with a robotic arm in the form of Lala Hiyama as there is nothing revealed over why she appears as she is while everyone else aboard the Sidonia is human in appearance. In addition, the series ends inconclusively as there are lingering mysteries unresolved with several plot elements within Sidonia.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Sidonia is pleasing enough with its animation and implementation of realistic elements for its sci-fi, the series doesn't offer much new to the sci-fi and mecha genres that have been seen from similar titles of its ilk, which made it hard for me to care much for the story and characters it had to offer up. Action and sci-fi fans may enjoy this if they overlook this problem. But Sidonia had me feeling like I seen the stuff it offered up too many times at this point in my 13 years of anime fandom.",

The pilots are all idiots, especially early in the series. None of them follow orders. Whenever a fight starts it turns into chaos as they all do random things. In fact, that\u2019s basically how their whole society works. Most of the jeopardy in this show comes from people's stupidity, which makes it very hard to understand how they managed to avoid blowing themselves up for so long. \r\nIn particular, I found it hard to suspend disbelief during an incident where a quick look at missiondata would have instantly clarified what happened. Obviously these people are so advanced that they don't need to record flight data of any kind. Wait, are we meant to assume that they just don\u2019t care? After all, it\u2019s not like suffering severe losses in combat is a big deal or anything. It\u2019s not like it matters if a mission ends in utter failure and the big world-ending monster comes and kills everybody. Hey, where did the monster go? Maybe it fell into a plot hole while the main character was unconscious. Ah, well, it doesn\u2019t matter anyway. Time to shut off the brain. There\u2019s a second season coming, you know.\\n\\n\\n",

When there\u2019s something at stake. When there\u2019s tension. When the main characters could actually lose and fuck up.\r\nThis is my biggest issue with the superhero genre. You know Superman or Wolverine are never going to lose. If they die they\u2019ll just come back because nobody stays dead in comics. Your toast getting burnt is more inconvenient.\r\nWhen you know your heroes will win or won\u2019t die then any excitement is gone. What\u2019s the point of watching? It can still be entertaining, but it would bemuch, much better if there was tension.\\n\\n\r\nThis is what I liked about Knights of Sidonia. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve felt excitement and fear whenever the characters fought the enemy. The aliens are very strong. The characters\u2019 mecha suits don\u2019t do shit. To kill the aliens you need to use a very specific weapon and to hit them in a very specific body part.\\n\\n\r\nEvery time they went out to battle there would be casualties. Someone always died. It could\u2019ve been a minor characters or some cannon fodder, but someone died.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, the sci-fi setting is interesting, and I\u2019m a sucker for interesting worlds.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s stopping me from giving this a fresh, fucking 9 is that the characters aren\u2019t that engaging. It\u2019s ironic considering how much tension the show can build.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is boring. He\u2019s never excited or ask questions for us to learn about the world. The minor characters are a little shallow, but they work enough. Also, the CGI animation makes everyone look the same. It was jarring at first, but you get used to it. And you\u2019ll maybe find someone you like to get invested with.",

            "content": "Ok, I don't write many reviews, but considering how bad this anime was I feel it can't be that hard. \r\nThis was probably spelled out in the plot synopsis, but Knights of Sidonia (or \u30b7\u30c9\u30cb\u30a2\u306e\u9a0e\u58eb) is a science fiction, mecha action anime where humans have fled Earth a thousand years ago on a giant space ship called 'Sidonia' fleeing from the threat of unknown origin known as the 'Gauna'. Protagonist Nagate Tanikaze in search for food stumbles out of the vast inner workings of Sidonia and out into the open society where he is selected to be a Guardian Pilot defending Sidonia against the Gaunathreat. \\n\\n\r\nI've never been a fan of CGI in anime since it definitely isn't Japan's strong suit (though I commend them for trying something new) and they'd be better off just sticking to what they already do best and focus on other aspects of storytelling. So I came into this anime with a hesitant mindset, but I soon got entranced really quickly when the first space battle happened. The 'gauna' are awesome in my opinion. They can take many different forms and can evolve to increase their efficiency at countering human technology. On top of that, they are horrifying. Not the most scary thing I've seen, but I wouldn't want to tango with any of those. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough, I think what captured me most about the beginning of this show was space; everything space. I love space, and anything that takes place in space is sure to capture my attention. Also, I was impressed how the concept of space wasn't just a setting, but was also a factor in the story and the battles. And the life on the titular space ship 'Sidonia' was well thought out as well with interesting differences in society affected by advanced technology such as human photosynthesis that allows a independence of food and water for a week. The main character didn't grow up in the society of Sidonia and as a result he can't photosynthesize. I liked this distinction in his character. And herein lies the first problem: that's the only thing I like about this character. \\n\\n\r\nSo for the first episode, Knights of Sidonia is going in a pretty good direction in my opinion. And honestly, this had me tricked for the next few episodes. It took me awhile before I realized it steadily got worse. It started when I realized that this anime is almost the exact same plot as Attack on Titan (\u9032\u6483\u306e\u5de8\u4eba). First off, a main character that doesn't know his origins joins the military when the enemy reappears after a hundred years without a sighting. The main protagonist quickly becomes the spearhead of the military when he is discovered to be a special asset that could almost single handedly win the war; a war in which humanity has been waging as long as they can remember and threatens the very existence of humankind. A war with an enemy that is bent on the complete eradication of humans without determinable rhyme or reason. Humans built a special base to defend and counteract against the enemy that is led by questionable leaders that could prove just as much a threat as the outside enemy. \\n\r\nThe baseline of this story is extremely similar to Attack on Titan with different setting, characters, and plot twists (very poor and predictable plot twists I might add).\\n\\n\r\nSo I started comparing the two, and I began seeing very clear distinctions in what Knights of Sidonia was lacking. As I said before, I despise the protagonist. Not just because he is awkward, annoying, bland, and holds no true character flaws besides being socially inapt, but mainly because I have no idea why he is fighting the gauna so passionately. In Attack on Titan, Eren held a very powerful grudge against the Titans because of his past experiences with them.This is what allowed us to sympathize and connect with Eren as a character. Nagate has absolutely no past experiences with the gauna and suddenly because somebody just simply asked him to become the 'Knight of Sidonia' or some prophetic hero destined to save Sidonia he becomes determined to eliminate all of the gauna and dedicate his life to protecting the society and people that he 'loves'. When you read it, that would at least make a little sense, but keep in mind that he decided this after being in this society for only a few days! How can he claim to love something he hardly as any knowledge of? Worst of all, whenever he is not fighting gauna or speaking with Sidonia's commander, he seems to completely forget all that. The motivation that is meant to drive him as a character hardly affects him at all, and I end up forgetting what his role is in the story. And I'm going to go so far as to say that I forget what the story even is about anymore whenever their not fighting gauna.\\n\\n\r\nThis show doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be an awesome scifi, or if it wants to be a mediocre harem. Honestly, the harem aspect takes 75 percent of the screen time, and almost all of it is completely useless. There was only one time when the harem part of the story affected the actual plot. I attribute this to a misunderstanding of (or just pure apathy to) the concept of character development. Knights of Sidonia seems to interpret that as 'sexual tension' and 'love drama'. To make it worse, sometimes this sexual tension/love drama is so poorly written and cheesy that I started to think I was watching a porno. Dialogue is bad, characters are one dimensional and unappealing, and its just overall disappointing to see this interesting society getting plague by these cardboard cutouts of overused character archetypes. The protagonist is terrible, the female characters are worse because they are head over heels for this guy for absolutely no other reason than a 'because I said so' attitude by the author, and this other male character who seemed to be important had promise since he was the protagonist's opposite and was willing to make morally ambiguous decisions to get his way; however, when he started to see some of the effects of his decisions, he quickly became a wimp, quit being a pilot, and was kicked out of the story never to be relevant again. Honestly, the best character in this show is the Benisusume, whose identity is a spoiler so I won't reveal anymore than that except that this character has only about four lines that are almost exactly the same. And the worse part of this is the portrayal of women. I know that the anime industry usually targets adolescent boys who can't focus on anything that doesn't have breast the size of jupiter, but this is ridiculous. Also, this show can't possibly be intended for young boys, because it clearly attempts to make itself dark and gritty like Tokyo Ghoul or Attack on Titan but can never stick to that tone. So I don't know what audience the author is writing to and what he is trying to say with his story. It sounded like mindless babbling to me. \\n\\n\r\nI don't talk too much on the story in comparison to the characters, but that is because the story was interesting and held promise; though, it was quickly overshadowed by every other terrible thing that it completely lost its appeal. I watched this show to the end in hopes of rekindling that promise and maybe the story would once again have the majority of the screen time, and I was given at least a fraction of reward with a season finale in both seasons that were done fairly well and proved that if this author had simply stuck to what he does best instead of this harem garbage this could have been a good thing. \\n\r\nNot to say that I don't think harems can be good. I have watched a lot of harems and enjoyed a few. I'm just saying this is a very bad one. \\n\\n\r\nSince sound is an area of critique on this site, I'll mention a little something about that. There isn't much that stands out about the soundtrack and nothing leaves an impression except for the opening credits. I imagine that these openings were meant to be exciting and with a hint of patriotic-like pride just as the Attack on Titan openings were. However, these fail terribly at replicating this. The animation for the opening is literally shots from the rest of the show dreadfully edited together with a very underwhelming song choice that lacks energy, emotion, and impact. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I didn't enjoy Knights of Sidonia despite the very interesting concept behind it simply because it didn't allow me to enjoy it by shoving other things I don't care about in my face and trying to get me to accept them. This show really has an identity crisis, trying to wear the clothes of a harem comedy while also trying to be a gritty, realistic scifi. If a harem comedy anime wants me to take it seriously and realistically, then it either needs to not be a harem comedy or try harder; a lot harder. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, don't watch this show. It is horrible, and it is the definition of what is wrong with the anime industry that can't seem to let go of its horrendous cliches and characters archetypes. When will they start trusting us to be interested in a story that doesn't have kinky sexual comedy and breasts the size of jupiter?",

It can be easily overlooked because of appearances, however, I can assure you that if you give it a chance you will be very pleased with the story, the pace, the characters and the overall development.\r\nThe plot is not an entirely new scenario, it is about survival of humanity in deep space. However, it is delivered in such a beautiful way with good, fast pace, enticing plot twists, romance, meaningful drama, even some comedy and cliffhangers at the end of each episode, that stimulate your interest to learn more about where all this goes. The characterdevelopment is good, nevertheless, you may find the characters themselves being a bit blunt at times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it feels that there is non-stop action from the beginning till the end. One thing to note about the plot is that this first season is building up the foundations for the second season. Hence, some question-marks that will be raised here will be answered later on.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is very good and memorable, especially the OP and theme song and it is used perfectly to match and enhance the intensity of the scenes. The CGI art feels unique and mature and adds a lot to the seriousness of the plot but it also enhances the mecha combat scenes tremendously. All in all, a very enjoyable watch and an interesting plot that flows very well without stagnation and will retain your interest till the end.\\n\\n\r\nAll sci-fi, survival, space, mecha and action fans should not miss this one! Even if you are not a big fan of CGI, give it at least 3-4 episodes and I am sure your opinion will change! It is a great watch and a must see that you cannot miss!",

            "content": "Sidonia no Kishi i rate 10 of 10. It 'been long since i watched something with such enjoyment.\r\nI often rate some good animes 8-9 ball, but 10 i give almost never. But this is exactly that situation.\r\nThis is, a perfect mecha story. Mecha_as_it_should_be. And one of the finest pieces of action/adventure anime at all(much better than, e.g., overrated by dumb kids \"Attack on Titan\").\r\nLet me explain why at every point:\r\n1)Atmospherous  music,  not only the exatly compositions, but the timing and appropirateness of sound to very each moment is perfect.\r\n2)No cryings, stupid emotions for half the episode in \"IWILLKILLYOUEVILLLLAAAAAA\" style, and also no reflectionsfor half of episode.\\n\\n\r\n3)Main charecter. He is not slow, stupid, pervert or something. His emotions are a bit typical for these genre main characters, but, again - there is no annoying roraring, crying, childy enragements and so on for half of each episode, no things that ruined many other good animes.\\n\\n\r\n4)The story is being told very softly - typically in animes of same genere, its like - deep \"coolstories\" told in the beginning, then, in middle of series:-\"To hell the lore, lets enjoy how wide protagonist can open his mouth!\". Here, in Sidonia no Kishi, they make it the different way.\\n\r\nThey explain almost nothing in the beginning, but in the end, you will understand every character purposes and what's what and for what purpose in this world is. If you have ability to think, of course.\\n\r\nBattle scenes are really unpredictable in comparison to other similar genere animes.\\n\r\nYes, MC(main character) will not die, but all other things is very deceicive and unsetted to you before you watch it.\\n\\n\r\n5)Animation and art. Could be better, could be worse. Not a masterpiece ofc, but not ugly overall and suits these series atmosphere well.\\n\\n\r\n6)Characters - could be better too, but...no stupid&slow protagonist. No persky moe. No lolitas.\\n\r\nNo stupid troublemakers and other fanservice characters. This anime is serious, solid - and so do it's characters, with very few uncritical exceptions. Seriosity without boring long \"coolstories\", comedy elements without stupidity, almost a harem, but not harem...such way of things are very rare thing in modern animes.\\n\\n\r\n7)...and...no, i don't think i need to continue.\\n\\n\r\nIn total:\\n\\n\r\nWant to watch some good plot adventures anime, but tired of stupid troublemking protagonists, dull stories and too much fanservice, and don't want to be bored with too much unimportant lore? Then Sidonia no Kishi is your choice. I strongly recommend this one to everyone of my cast, the people who think they \"overgrown\" watching cartoons&sure that modern anime is degrading(and its true). But not in this title. This is what the anime exatly should be imo.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to the ones who understand, i'm sure i convinced you to watch it. For others, let me prepare a departure ceremony for you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cAttack on Titan in space?  Well\u2026. not quite.\u201d\r\nI was terribly hesitant to delve into another dystopian anime with mechs, as I feel it can be one of the most overused plot elements in any anime, but at the strong recommendation of a friend I tuned into Sidonia no Kishi (Knights of Sidonia).  What I found was a CGI-infused space epic of sorts, which I even later found out to be compared often to Attack on Titan.  It\u2019s a show I wanted to like, but turned out to bland in a lot of ways, hindering its overall successes.  \r\nKnights of Sidonia takesplace years after unidentified creatures known as \u201cGauna\u201d invaded Earth, forcing the population to seek refuge elsewhere in space aboard Sidonia, a massive, self-supporting deep space vessel.  Tanikaze, the MC in this series appears to have been living in the depths of Sidonia his entire life, practicing blowing Gauna away in a spacefighting simulator created by his Grandpa.  His grandpa passes away and is left to venture out into the real world for the first time.  Honestly, he ends up adjusting to never interacting with other humans before quite well.  For initially unknown reasons, the captain of the Sidonia military takes a liking to Tanikaze and puts him into pilot training.  There also seems to be an instant harem element present, as the academy\u2019s vice president and other random girls blush at every glance from Tanikaze\u2026 of course they would.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest gripe I have with the story in Knights of Sidonia is the actual lack of plot depth.  You see battle after battle with lots of pilots dying, but no one seems to know anything about the Gauna or where they came from.  You would think that after several centuries of fighting with these things\u2026 that SOMETHING would\u2019ve been uncovered, just a little clue.  Also, we come to find that there is an immortal council devised of Sidonia residents who seek immortality and provide general guidance to their figurehead, who just so happens to be the military captain.  The only problem is, their formation is alluded to but never fully explained.  And, to make it better\u2026 there\u2019s also a chick that is a bear for some reason.  In a ship full of humans, just one bear\u2026. with a robotic hand.  Nice.  You think at one point Tanikaze would ask\u2026 \u201cHey Lala, why is it that you\u2019re a bear?\u201d  Nope, of course it\u2019s normal.\\n\\n\r\nTanikaze literally seems like the only intelligent pilot in existence.  Despite the amazing amount of preparation that the other members of the military had to fight against the Gauna, their best four pilots get wiped out almost instantly in their first battle.  Seems legit.  To top it off, by the third battle or so the mediocre pilots are slaying ten to twenty of the Gauna at a time.  All the battles seem to play out the same way as well, which makes the detailed and flashy battle scenes less impressive.  Don\u2019t worry though, Tanikaze will end up pulling through in the end! The story isn\u2019t all bad though, the relationship between Tanikaze and Hoshijiro blossoms well, and the outlook of the dystopian society is well written\u2026 just not enough to make up for the blandness.  I also didn\u2019t notice a large amount of similarities between AoT and KoS, except for the low amount of people remaining from Earth and some unexplained entity that they\u2019re fighting to survive against.  I feel that archetype is presented in other animes as well.\\n\\n\r\nAn even weaker part of Knights of Sidonia is the characters and the writing of dialogue.  Tanikaze is the stereotypical haremy badass of a protagonist, but his inner emotions and history are never really expounded upon at all.  It would help me relate to the character more if these areas were explained\u2026 at least a little bit.  Due to the heavy CGI used in the animation style, it can also be tasking and difficult to decipher proper body language of the characters themselves.  If it weren\u2019t for the random blushing redness on their faces, a comment could honestly be taken way out of context.  The character\u2019s movements made me slightly nostalgic to older shows like Reboot on Toonami, as they seemed to all move similarly.  If you listen closely you can hear their bleeps and bloops.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are so boring that when they die, I feel apathetic to the whole thing.  If that\u2019s the effect they were going for, they hit the nail on the head.  I did feel Kunato got some development as the series went on, and I actually kind of felt bad for him from the stress consuming him from being a pilot and throwing Tanikaze under the bus regarding Hoshijiro.  It\u2019s a spark of some development but not much.\\n\\n\r\nSome people say the CGI makes or breaks viewer\u2019s experience with KoS, but I\u2019m not quite onboard with that mentality.  Sure, it is rather hard to watch at first, because it is different.  And yes, it does detract from the static conversations between characters, but the action scenes are actually beautiful and well constructed.  And they\u2019re plentiful in the anime, which made me actually anticipate what would come next.  The sound is also pretty good.  The opening theme does remind me of Attack on Titan with its fanfare, and the sound effects of the Gardes are cool to say the least.  The OST in general never lacked, and the dramatic openings of battles were orchestrated very well.  Voice acting is alright, but nothing noteworthy.  I had a hard time differentiating between some of the female cast.  \\n\\n\r\nAside from the plot holes and unoriginal or bland characters, I did enjoy KoS.  It was nonstop action which allowed me to watch almost the entire series in one sitting.  The special effects were great, and I am a sucker for space mechs with oversized guns.\\n\\n\r\nKnights of Sidonia could\u2019ve been improved in several ways, and I think the CGI art style may have been a bit too ambitious for the writers to counterbalance with the plot and characters.  Although I enjoyed it, I don\u2019t think it would be for everyone.  If you have some time to kill, and you\u2019re looking for a lot of fast paced action, this one is for you.  Thanks for reading! \\n",

            "content": "It's quite a weird story how I came to watch this series. One day I was browsing anime series as to what to watch, and \"Knights of Sidonia\" caught my eye. Something immediately clicked in my mind. I just knew I've seen this somewhere a long time ago, but the description of the anime didn't jog anything, besides, it was a brand new series and I remembered seeing this title many years ago. It was bugging me to no end, but I just couldn't remember. So, on a whim, I decided to watch Knights of Sidonia, in hopes to uncover the mystery. All I cansay, this is nothing I expected...\\n\\n\r\nBasically, Knights of Sidonia is a quite average mecha anime with some pretty interesting ideas in art and direction. First of all, the story is blatantly bland and doesn't even worth discussing. It's your standard mecha action-schlock: Armageddon du jour threatens humanity with total destruction, humans fights back with huge mechas. Take unassuming \"Bland Hero No#12628\" who rises from nowhere with an uncanny ability to control said mechas better than even seasoned veterans, rising from zero to hero in an instant, pissing off the enemy, making other male pilots jealous and making all the girls wet their panties with joy. Then force in a totally out of place \"highschool love triangle\" romance subplot, throw in a handful of typecast side characters as plot devices, season with tragic backstory and shady government conspiracy, and finally marinate the whole thing in fast-paced shooty-explodey action scenes. Viola, Knights of Sidonia. It's not bad, but it's nothing revolutionary either, it serves it's purpose as far as story goes, nothing more, nothing less.\\n\\n\r\nWhere it gets interesting, is the art direction and the animation itself. For better or for worse, aside from a few parts, the whole thing is made using cell-shaded 3D CGI animation. Because of this, the whole art style uses really thin lines, incredibly bleached/desaturated color palette and significantly higher framerate, which can be pretty jarring against the hand-drawn backdrops sometimes. Also, it doesn't lend itself very well to individual characters, especially facial animations. All the characters, including the protagonist, look completely unremarkable and borderline devoid of emotions. When they do try to force emotions on the characters, it slides into Uncanny Valley territory pretty fast. Not to mention the (thankfully) few goofy/over-the-top fan service and comic relief scenes, where it comes off as downright jarring. \\n\\n\r\nCriticism aside, the same CGI makes it possible to present some pretty detailed, jaw-dropping action scenes, particle effects and tech eye-candy. The higher framerate and the smooth animations make for some incredible, adrenaline-pumping action scenes and effects, that rarely ever been seen in anime before. The sci-fi/cyberpunk art direction is very well suited to this animation style, and creates some of the best looking scenes and landscapes I saw in ages. There is an obvious focus on realism regards to the tech, the animation and the story too, which gives the series a sense of consistency in place of the lacking characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I was watching the last episode, I finally realized where I heard the name before. It was back in 2007, I played \"Guitar Hero 3: Legends Of Rock\", where I had to play a (then) relatively fresh Muse song with the title, yea you guessed it, \"Knights of Cydonia\". I remember it quite well, since it was a nightmare to get through that whole song on Expert. Funny enough, it has many common attributes with this anime: a pretty bland piece with bad pacing and plastic \"instruments\" but some pretty impressive technical flair that somehow makes it all worth it in the end.\\n\\n\r\nAccording to the news, the second season is in production, so I'll be waiting. I'm pretty intrigued as to where this path will lead.",

            "content": "Sidonia no Kishi, aka \"Knights of Sidonia,\" can best be summed up as a collection of interesting elements that never reaches it's potential.\r\nThe story is set in the distant future, featuring space ships, war, a third gender,  and super powerful aliens known as Gauna. The Gauna in particular is where the story reaches it's peak; these super-powered aliens which resemble machines are incredibly deadly and constantly evolving. You can really feel the fear the characters do when their squads are being cut down like butter, having to watch their comrades gruesomely die screaming.\r\nThe third gender that is introduced is also one of it's finerideas. This hermaphroditic third gender can act as either male or female, depending on what Sidonia needs to bolster it's population. But like the series as a whole, the idea is never entirely fleshed out. There is merely one episode dedicated to this fact, and it's around one of the main characters, Izana. She falls in love with the main character and ultimately decides to become a girl, which is fine in it's own right, but what being a third gender is like never explored enough, simply glossed over. Sexual identity, a big topic today, is never brought to terms with the third gender. It's unfortunate that the idea wasn't executed as well as it should have been.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in general aren't unlikeable per se, but neither are they particularly interesting. Izana's identity as a third gender is brushed aside after one episode. And every character has a bland design, looking nearly identical to everyone else and having vague motivations. The three protagonists all have short dark hair, with similar eyes and statures (including Izana). There's the general chick whom has dark hair and wears a mask, with some vague history of a grudge or something and a silver haired prodigy of sorts whom is jealous of Nakate, the main protagonist, for taking a legendary ship or something. There's also an old repair guy whom gets a few lines towards the end of the series, the main protagonists grandpa who's mentioned several times for some sort of history and training Natake. A group of old guys whom run things and probably know stuff. Everyone amounts to nothing more than a bunch of vague \"somethings.\"\\n\\n\r\nThat only scratches the surface as to the problem with the characters. Other than the fear factor the Gauna emanate, you'll be asking yourself \"Why should I care about these people?\" Most of the story and characters give that impression regardless, and it's mostly due to the perplexing elements that are never told or explained properly. Who? Why? When? How? These are questions which are too often never answered.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is usually fantastic in it's presentation, even if the \"high speed\" scenes can be difficult to follow sometimes, it's usually good and battles often look slick. My only complaint, other than the aforementioned boring character designs, is that the majority of environments are bland and uninteresting. That may work for a series set in modern day Tokyo, but not one that takes place in the distant future in space. The sound is okay, usually- things that shoot go pew, things that blow up go boom. Yet neither are there any particularly memorable tracks or songs. I guess the patriotic opening was decent.\\n\\n\r\nThe story harvests a bunch of good ideas together. Unfortunately, few of these ideas ever become ripe enough to be worth indulging. It becomes apparent by the eighth episode that it won't ever be anything more than a mishmash of several good concepts, and in the end it fails to succeed at even a few basic, essential ones. You'll finish it befuddled, wondering what could have been. By the following week, you'll have forgotten everything about it, forever referring to it as \"that space anime I watched one time.\"",

            "content": "Sidonia no Kishi follows the black sheep of Sidonia, Tanikaze Nagate. He's an 'underground' person who has lived underground in Sidonia since birth. He received elite training for piloting a Gardes since childhood by the Ace of Sidonia. One day, he finally comes up to the surface in search of food. There, a few incidences occured and he was enrolled in a school which trains Sidonians to become Gardes pilots.\r\nI was skeptical about watching this anime due to it being generated by computer graphics in contrast to traditional animation, much like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Stardust Crusaders. However, unlike the latter, Sidonia no Kishi misses outon the little details of the faces with makes the face as smooth as a pebble. It might be awkward to look at at first but you'll get used to it, I hope. The animations are much smoother than traditional animation which makes it more pleasurable to watch. The environment is immersive. It makes me feel like I'm in the world itself. Make sure you watch it on a big screen though, if not what I said was irrelevant. After completing, I feel that this anime needs the computer graphics since the story is set in space. The three dimension gives it a spacey feel.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is not bad. I love the opening of Sidonia no Kishi, especially the \"Knights of Sidoniaaaa...\" chorus. The background music is well suited and choreographed to the on-screen action. As I basshead, I enjoyed the ending as well.\\n\\n\r\nNow on to the characters. Nagate is just your typical hero who everyone dislikes at first but then something happened which made him famous. He is quite dense as he can't seem to get the hint that a few girls like him. But he's not all bad, Nagate is a caring person who would do anything to help his friends. Izana is just plain annoying in my opinion. She's the kind of girl, wait...SHE'S NOT A GIRL! I'll use it then since it's a neutral gender. It is a kind of person who would get jealous whenever another girls tries to get close. Its attitude isn't likeable at all. I wished it would have died instead of Hos...oh never mind no spoilers...\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has an outstanding story but there is one big flaw, it's rushed. I wished that it would have lasted longer, 12 episodes is just too short. I can feel that lot's of important events are missing. I understand animating using computer graphics can be costly, but the director should put audience first instead of budget. But in this world where time is money, I don't think such sentiments are fundamental at all. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this anime is a must watch. I feel that it's kind of underrated considering only a handful of people discuss about this anime. I really hope this anime gets a second season, it's has a lot of potential.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review! This is my first review so I hope it makes sense and that you like it. Please give me constructive criticism if necessary, I want to improve on my reviewing skills. Thanks again!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "-------------------------------------\r\n| Knights of Sidonia : Review |\r\n-------------------------------------\r\nKnights of Sidonia is an another Dystopian Sci-Fi Mecha series that's set in Space written by Tsutomu Nihei who was famous for his highly successful manga Blame! and bought life by Polygon Studios. \r\nI went into the series without reading the manga and without much expectation , and it was an fairly average experience. I wouldn't necessarily say it was awful , but was it good enough to stand out from the rest ? No. Is it worth watching ? Let's find out shall we. \r\n-----------\r\nStory - 6\r\n-----------\r\nThe premise of the story is solid and competent but nothing unique.Earth is destroyed , Humans now colonize in space on a giant spaceship which in now being attacked. But one of the glaring issues is while it supposed to be this dystopian setting , the viewer doesn't really feel that tension. Beside a few civilians dying in one episode and a few civilian protest scenes , you would expect the environment to be more chaotic. The pacing feels rushed , nothing is properly explained , the show keeping throwing half-baked information at you and it gets rather confusing at times. The romantic subplots feels cheesy.., forced and awkward. \\n\r\nBeside it's flaws , it does provide enough conflicts and space battles to keep the viewer interested , even tho most of it is clich\u00e9 and predictable. \\n\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nArt - 3\\n\r\n-----------\\n\\n\r\nDear Polygon studio , what the fuck ?\\n\r\nOkay , I don't hate CGI by default. I think CGI can look great when properly utilized , Ghost in the Shell : Innocence is a great example for that. But here , It's an atrocity.\\n\r\nI feel like they could have at least put some effort into making the different characters look unique , But No. Even the main characters of the series are indistinguishable  from most of the side characters in the series. I was genuinely confused about who is who most of the time. This isn't helped by the poor characterization which I'll get into later.\\n\r\nAll the backgrounds and environments are kept pretty simple , which isn't entirely a bad thing because it's doesn't feel bloated. Everything look black or white most of the times. Something that deserves fair points is how they animated the space battles , which looked fairly good most of the times , everything felt smooth and the effects were adequate.\\n\\n\r\n-------------\\n\r\nSound - 6\\n\r\n-------------\\n\\n\r\nThis is where a series like this could have truly shined. But sadly , Musical score of the series is almost non-existent. I value the soundtrack of a series very highly , and I felt this series could have profited from a good soundtrack and the lack of it was clearly apparent.\\n\r\nBut what they should receive major points for the fantastic opening theme , which I never skipped even though I was bing watching the show and heard it 10 times in the past 12 hours. \\n\r\nI should also point out that the sound effects on the series was really well done , so plus points for that.\\n\\n\r\n-----------------\\n\r\nCharacters - 3\\n\r\n-----------------\\n\\n\r\nOh boy! , This is one of the sections that the series really faltered. I already mentioned that the characters were indistinguishable from each other because of the poor characters designs and the artwork , that really highlights how poor the characterization were. They didn't just simply look the same , there were no unique characteristics to identify them , most of them had any unique personalities and was pretty generic.\\n\r\nThe main character was one of the most boring and bland protagonists I've seen in quite a while. In the first episode , his introduction was him stealing bread and doing somethings he shouldn't be doing. You would expect some kind of punishment , But the writers say \"Well , Fuck that\" and gives him a job as a pilot ?\\n\r\nI did hoped that the main character would get some development later on but character development was ignored here , almost completely. The MC was the same bland and interesting character when the series ended as when it started.\\n\r\nMost of the female characters in the show are there as romantic interests for the main character , and not interesting or unique , although fairly likable. \\n\r\nSo in short , characters are bland and uninteresting. \\n\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall Experience - 5\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment ? Honestly , not that much. The most enjoyable part for me was the opening theme. At times it felt like a chore mostly because I had to put in an effort to even differentiate characters from each other. and I expected more out of the soundtrack.\\n\r\nWould I recommend it ? No , But if you really like Mecha's ,Love Triangles and Space battles , you might want to give it a try.\\n\\n\r\n---------------------------\\n\r\n| Recommendations |\\n\r\n---------------------------\\n\\n\r\n[Neon Genesis Evangelion] Just a much better Dystopian Mecha series , that excels and blows Sidonia out of the water in every department. \\n\\n\r\n[Attack on Titan] A series that truly captures the desperation and intensity of what it feels like to be corned and attacked as a race.",

And it has an incomprehensible, open ended, and objectiveness plot line.\r\ni want to rate this anime much lower but i just can't.\r\nFor one the animations are mostly solid and follow real world laws of physics and mechanics(which most animethrow out the window) but of course with the aid of a little bit of magic fantasy go juice. The art in beautiful. And the only complaint i have is that the human characters seem a little rigid but if you get past that it is very good.\\n\\n\r\nTwo the main focus is on the characters, character interactions, and character development. so despite the fact that the plot base is an uncompelling  and endless, fight against the bad guys with no end in sight, you just kinda forget about that because most of the time is spent building the characters with lots of time taken establishing and developing character relationships interesting ways. You have long down times to watch the main character grow and change followed with intense battles that limit plot armor to a minimum. there is a slight disconnect with some of the characters but its forgivable and you end up just enjoying the mindless march towards whatever the next improvised plot point ends up being. \\n\\n\r\nthree perfect pacing. nuf said.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not happy about it but they nail enough aspects that i have to give this anime a good score even though i don't want to. In the end i really enjoyed watching it but really wish it explained things better and took some time developing an end objective rather than bumbling along.",

Hamilton, Iain M Banks (oh sweet Izana, I love your character!), Dan Simmons, Gregory Benford, and more...antounding and shows the author trully loves science fiction and has made his homework into what is best out there in the genre.\r\nThe space sequences, the way theymaneuver and the takes from the \"camera\" are so enticing and cinematic that you can feel the Sidonia in its massiveness flying. The battle frames in action...perfect! And the Gauna terrifying since their first appearance.\\n\\n\r\nThe Gauna, terrifying and yet misterious in an interesting way...perfect!\\n\\n\r\nI just hope the sequel takes the story ahead keeping the high quality seen so far. \\n\\n\r\nAs it is now, SnK is a Masterpiece, and I will surelly watch it again and again until more comes!\\n\\n\r\nI just hope more true Science Fiction pieces start to come forth. If new series have half the attention and care  into this genre. I will be really happy!!!",

            "content": "Just finished watching Season 1. I will keep it short as much as I can...or I will be writing essays. Well, its been a while since I watched an anime, and particularly a mecha sci-fi anime. Of the mecha genre, many of today's' franchises are dumbed down, cover in cliches, with overpowered God \"Gundams\", and characters with invincible plot armor. After watching KoS .... my mind was completely blown, good mecha anime actually exist I actually feared for my characters, the environments & setting were believable (Of course, its fiction not 100% realistic), and the writing & directing is incredibly engaging & well done. Downfall would be the fact that the 1st season is only 12 episodes long, and feels like it could have been at least a 20 ep. season. Some people could point out that certain things can be considered cliches, however I personally found them more supportive then not distracting at all to the story. Character development is limited to just only 12 ep. and could be fleshed out better if there was opportunity of additional episodes. The CGi/animation can be considered between good & average for dialog scenes, however I am amazed by the detail of combat scenes, and each scene being mostly original. Music and scoring is considered good, none of the music is distracting and does a good job of drawing emotion from the scene to the viewer. However I will say not much of the scores are memorable except mainly for the opening theme song. In conclusion, this anime makes me feel at home, in a sense familiar, but at the same time new, fresh, and exciting. I am happy that for once that its not produced by studios like Sunrise. Polygon Picture efforts to step in to the mecha genre is very much appreciated. I give Knights of Sidonia Season 1 a strong 8/10, with my personal recommendations to those interested in military, mecha, sci-fi genres. Possibly one of the best of this genre I have ever seen. I will have determined that when season 2 is released. Oh one more thing, this is a Netflix exclusive anime, something we don't see everyday, but a great reason to get netflix haha.",

            "content": "After finishing this series, I couldn't hold myself back to write review for this series. Mainly because it seem that this series isn't really popular, underrated and also overshadowed by the like no game no life who ran at the same season. However the two generally have the same quality overall. I loved the both of it anyways.\r\nStory 9/10 :\r\nStory in Sidonia no Kishi is like a combination of Gundam and Shingeki no Kyojin. Do not afraid this series isn't a Shingeki no Kyojin wannabe, not to mention that the manga of this series started before Shingeki. In short the story is about humanity thatwas doomed because of the Gauna and humanity forced to escape to the space, hiding inside a massive ship, building their home there, and trying to live peacefully. Our hero is a underground teen who mastered the control of humanoid robot, used to fight off Gauna. Beside horror, action, mecha and science fiction which are really amazing, the story also contained romance. Oh, The romance is surprisingly well done too. I loved the story this could be bias because well I just love this kind of story, I guess.    \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime use a full CG and 3D character instead of usual 2D.  At first, this was the reason I didn't want to watch the series. However I heard many good things, positive reviews and critics for this show, so I decided to try this once more. It's really worth it! Gradually I begin to love the art, and the CG, also the great character designs. After a few episodes I found this wasn't a problem anymore and even become one of the uniqueness in this show. Beside the CG, the effect also mesmerizing too, detailed! \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nAbsolutely ten! The sound in this series is AWESOME! I love the opening and the ending song. those give an extra vibe to the series. The opening use a certain bit orchestra which is good. Give the feeling of Apocalypse! :P\\n\r\nOH, i should praise the sound effects! So much detailed in every scene, GREAT.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nNot Special, rather mainstream, oh well not annoying at least so that's fine. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed my time watch this one, definitely worth it! The story make me wants more. It has twist and great moments! The great Soundtracks, the animation, the action and also the science fiction, all in one! I never found myself bored in this one too. Oh well there'll be a second season! Might read the manga while waiting the season two of this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nWhy not give this space-thriller action science fiction a chance? If you already watched and decide to stop at an early episode, why not giving this series second chance? Definitely worth it.. GREAT!",

            "content": "Intro: This is a review for both season 1 and season 2 since they are close in sound/animation/story/characters/enjoyment quality.\r\nSidonia no Kishi is an entertaining anime series, with thick plot armor but still enjoyable.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe premise is fairly interesting having a lot of potential.\r\nThe story is set in a distant future where humanity is almost extinct and the last traces of mankind are living in a spaceship trying to survive the alien (Gauna) attacks. \r\nThe story is fast paced since the spaceship is under constant danger of Gauna attacks and the humans are trying to take the offensive in the Gauna war. These Gauna creatures arerather interesting since they are portayed as having superior intelectual capabilities(although they don't prove it), having the ability to mimic the human body as well as other various diffrent abilities. \\n\\n\r\nWhy was a 3rd gender created? What is this 3rd gender person attracted to and does it think like a woman or a man? This \"3rd gender\"  has no genital organs, being able to change it's genitals to male/female based on their mating partner. That only comes out weird, since females have female mentality and are attracted to males and males have male mentality and are attracted to females, \\n\r\nthis 3rd gender has no place.\\n\\n\r\nIn the second season, unfortunately the anime jumps from action to harem for about 4 episodes, it is not very bad but not good either.\\n\\n\r\nThe creators overdid the Hoshijiro drama, keeping to bring back her human body after she died, just to add some drama and show some \"touching\" moments. I think in the end, the copy of Hoshijiro will somehow recover her original memories, even if the original Hoshijiro is dead.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, everything is unclear, not much is explained about the Gauna, the way these creatures are/were created, their origins, their motives or exactly how humanity was driven to the brink of extinction, leaving the viewer with many questions that will probably never be answered.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nThe characters come in great numbers but they are all a mess, none of them receive any decent characterization, background story or solid character development. I will not go into details since it is not neccessary, hoping an eventual 3rd season will solve the character problem.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed the animation, it is fluid and the art is nice and well suited to the show theme but the character art is blunt. At first the animation may feel weird since it is 3DCGI but as soon as you get adjusted you will like it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nThe 1st season has an amazing opening theme, nice ending theme, good background sound and good voice actors.\\n\r\nThe 2nd season has a decent opening theme, amazing ending theme, good background sound and good voice actors.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nFor some reason I don't know, even if the show is not very good, I really enjoyed the series, especially the fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.5/10\\n\r\nA fairly good mecha/space anime that is more than entertaining, fast paced and can easily be finished in one sitting. With that in mind, I recommend giving this anime a go.",

            "content": "While Knights of Sidonia Season 1 is an imperfect, probably too short experience I came away from it with a far more positive than negative impression and was immediately ready to watch Season 2. You'll find an uptempo, visually appealing show with a lot of action and solid world building here and I'd definitely recommend this show to fans of the genre.\r\nArt-\r\nThe visuals here are well above the norm and there is no shortage of flashy scenes designed to wow you. The world is beautifully drawn, the combat scenes are intense and many aspects of the environment are highly detailed. There may be an overuseof CGI in this series as a whole and that may turn off anime purists,  but undeniably this is a sharp looking show.\\n\\n\r\nSound-\\n\\n\r\nKnights of Sidonia Season 1 has one of my all time favorite intro songs, which I instantly added to my playlist upon completing the series, and have subsequently always enjoyed any time it's come up. Beyond that I found the sound quite average. The music beyond the intro was solid and fine but didn't stand out in any way and likewise the voice acting, while there aren't any glaring problems with it, felt very run of the mill for an anime with a good budget behind it. No character stood out to me as having an outstandingly good or clearly terrible voice performance.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter/Story-\\n\\n\r\nThe base premise and world building here are immediately gripping. There is absolutely a sense of danger and desperation in this show and there is no shortage of action or questions to be answered. Unfortunately, only some of those questions do indeed get answered. The show steps on the gas pedal pretty early on and rarely lets off of it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development and interpersonal relationships both leave a bit to be desired, as tends to be inevitable with 12 episode anime, but the characters that we do get a chance to know are largely interesting and are not cookie cutter or copy/pasted from other shows. \\n\\n\r\nThere are definitely some anime cliches to be found here, but none are inexcusable. Nevertheless, this is very much one of those \"the main character is more powerful/skilled/special than everyone else, all the girls want him, he's the chosen one, etc\" kind of shows. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nWhat kept the story engaging for me was the world-building, the mystery surrounding the enemy and the details of what the heck is up with one particular character, which I cannot talk about further without spoilers. I wish more answers were given and characters were more developed, but Knights of Sidonia Season 1 is such an uptempo and energetic experience, and most episodes end on a cliffhanger, I'd say the enjoyment factor for this show is quite high. At very least this isn't the kind of show where you can be bored watching it even if it doesn't end up being your cup of tea. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nHaving watched this show twice now I feel largely the same after the second time as I did after the first- I really like it. It's not perfect, but it earns very high marks for that impossible to quantify \"it\" factor where a show is simply entertaining to watch. It does a lot of things right from great world building, a sense of danger and mystery and great pacing and overall it should be a solid watch for Sci-Fi or Mech fans.\\n\\n\r\n+Great world-building\\n\r\n+Cool premise and sense of mystery that will keep you engaged\\n\r\n+Beautiful visuals\\n\r\n+Great pacing\\n\\n\r\n-Many unanswered questions\\n\r\n-Too much CGI\\n\r\n-Fan service\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- Strong 8\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- Strong 8",

And they are... It fits with the anime, and the songs are great.\r\nAbout the soundtrack, it is only a \"basic\" soundtrack, that fits with the moments, but nothing more, so a 7/10 for the sound is fair.\r\nCharacter.

(7/10) The first season of Sidonia no Kishi is a good season, 7/10 is a fair rate for the anime.\\n\\n",

            "content": "--Additional information--\r\nKnights of Sidonia, or Sidonia no Kishi is a mecha manga series by Tsutomu Nihei (Blame, Biomega), which was serialized by Kodansha in \u2018Afternoon\u2019 between April 2009 and September 2015. The manga is localized in English by \u2018Vertical.\u2019 An anime television series adaptation, produced by Polygon Pictures, aired between April and June 2014 and a second season aired between April and June 2015. An anime television series adaptation, produced by Polygon Pictures, premiered on April 10, 2014 and ended its first season on June 26, 2014, on MBS and later on TBS, CBC and BS-TBS. The series was directed by Kobun Shizuno, assisted byHiroyuki Seshita, with scripts by Sadayuki Murai and character designs by Yuki Moriyama. The series has also been localized and streamed by Netflix in all of its territories since July 4, 2014, becoming the service's first original anime, as well as the first anime series on Netflix available in Dolby Vision/HDR. The first season has been licensed for home video release by Sentai Filmworks.\\n\\n\r\n--Story-line--\\n\r\nThe future is not favorable for humans anymore: our planet is no longer there, world population has decreased dramatically because of the gauna invasion, and there is a chance that humans can be completely annihilated. However, humans are known for their ability to adapt and this time they will not give up that easily. Many seed ships are being created, which are later sent in different parts of space and are designed to be the last stronghold of the human race.  Although, seed ships do have weaponry, they use robots called gardes, or guardians to protect the main ship from any possible threat that might occur. \\n\\n\r\nNot much is known about seed ships now, because the distance between them is so great (150 something light years) that it takes more than 100 years only for one message to be delivered. In this lovely setting, Knight of Sidonia tells the viewer a story of Sidonia, which is one of these seed ships. Sidonia has its own guardian Saitou Hiroki, who is a guardian\u2019s pilot and Sidonia\u2019s top 1 ace. However, one day, due to some circumstances, Hiroki refuses to take medicine anymore, which increases the life of any human, helping them to never age; he takes his grandson with him and hides from the people of Sidonia. \\n\\n\r\nEventually, Hiroki dies and it forces his grandson to the surface. One of the Sidonia\u2019s leaders immediately understands that Nagate is the only grandson of one of the greatest ace pilots Sidonia has ever had and that his grandson is believed to be as skilled as his grandad and sends him on a mission. Right on his very first mission, Tanikaze faces the main foe of humanity that has not attacked Sidonia for a long while\u2014gauna. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Sidonia Knights\u2019 story-line does contain some clich\u00e9 mecha elements that you surely know about, it has one of the richest story-lines you will ever see in anime: an absolutely new setting, it contains many sci-fi elements, and it is just able to keep you in the never ending suspension, leaving you absolutely no time for breath; you simply have no time to think, because you do not know what to expect from this series. By the way, there are two seasoning now and the third season is underway, which means that there will be even more new details.\\n\\n\r\n--Note--\\n\r\nGauna are an alien lifeform that destroyed planet earth. The light-year is a unit of length used to express astronomical distances. It is about 9.5 trillion kilometers, or 5.9 trillion miles.\\n\\n\r\n--Art/Sound--\\n\r\nKnight of Sidonia has some awesome CG, which help to keep action scenes flashy and mind-blowing. You can find Knights of Sidonia\u2019s opening on youtube and you will get the idea how it is going to look like. Anyways, the animation manages to reflect that dark setting perfectly well, it also manages to keep the action scenes amazingly interesting to watch. However, my only problem with that is that while all character designs do look decent, I would have loved to see a better emotion portrayal for characters. Yet, it is not an anime about cute boys and girls doing cute things; the animation is good. Sound wise, Japanese dubbed version does a much better job than the English one. Sidonia no Kishi, as any mecha anime, has simply amazing OST, which was composed by Asakura Noriyuki, who also wrote the music for Rurouni Kenshin and Major. The opening theme \u2018sidonia\u2019 is performed by a Japanese pop band angela, which full version you should definitely check on youtube. They are notable for having their music portrayed as theme songs for several anime television shows. The band members are Atsuko(vocals) and Katsu(keyboard). Their signature upbeat tunes and rich arrangements combine elements of electronica, dance, rock, swing jazz and ska. The ending theme \u2018show\u2019 is performed by Eri Kitamura, who prefers j-rock, symphonic rock, symphonic metal, and pop rock. That said, Sidonia did surprise me with its opening and ending themes choice. The opening song sounds like a hymn to the last stronghold of humanity\u2014seed ships, when the ending theme somewhat keeps you in suspension, making you want to watch the next episode as soon as possible; they both fit the anime well.\\n\\n\r\n--Characters--\\n\r\nKnights of Sidonia has a very rich cast. Every character has its purpose in the series, they have their motives and aims they are trying to pursue. Although, it might take you some time to get used to these rather unusual characters that this anime has, since as it has been already been stated before, the main genre of this anime is sci-fi, so there will be many weird things. But even with that, all main and supporting characters are equally good. P.S. Do not mind the bear lady; Japan is a weird place. \\n\\n\r\n--Criticism (does not contain spoilers)--\\n\r\nOf course, this anime is not perfect, or flawless; nothing is. But I guarantee you that this series has more positive than negative sides. I cannot even call them serious flaws, they are just too minor for me to criticize. That said, Sidonia no Kishi, just like Evangelion, has the right to be called iconic mecha anime. It has a brand-new setting, as well as many elements, which have never been touched upon in any other sci-fi, or mecha anime. \\n\\n\r\n--Overall--\\n\r\nAll in all, I give this anime a very weak 10/10. Even if you are not a fan of mecha, think of this series as a sci-fi series, which involves robots. Robots, as well as robot fights, are not the main focus of this anime.  However, I have to say that this anime series has quite a bit of female nudity, along with some graphic violence, which makes it something that is not for kids. But do not be afraid, it does not have any unnecessary fanservice at all!\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most innovative sci-fi series you will ever see!",

Some characters have a tad too much plot armour taking away from the suspense of the life or death thrills though I was pleasantly surprised when main characters became mortal and died, especially love interests and those whose roles are generally kept throughout the show. Although the main character probably won't die anytime soon,everyone close to him can, so every battle poses a realistic threat to every character in the fight. I felt that the story could go more in depth as to some of the inner workings of the sidoniabut was ok with how they did hint at inner turmoil.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was really nice to listen to, and although not at the level of something like Code Geass or FMA:B, this was one of the only opening themes I did not skip\\n\\n\r\nThe animation takes some time getting used to, though in the end does have some moments of beauty with the CGI animation.\\n\\n\r\nI am excited for the next season and recommend this anime for anyone building their collection\\n\\n\r\nAlso why is everyone so white?

            "content": "I found out about Knights of Sidonia wen Netflix emailed me to tell me they had added the show to their streaming service.  I guess they know my tastes pretty well because once I finished the first episode I couldn't stop watching until I had completed the entire 1st Season.\r\nOnce you get over the initial shock of the animation style (an older CGI that reminded me of what lower-budget production studios might use, like at Roosterteeth) its really an interesting show with a lot of potential.  The sci-fi setting is great in that it takes the viewer away from what we normally knowliving on Earth.  The attention to detail on what living in a \"Seed Ship\" like Sidonia would be like is really very good - gravity, thrust, limited resources, population control, etc.  I'm a huge fan of hard-science-fiction and most movies and shows ignore these kinds of details, but Knights of Sidonia does not.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is pretty standard throughout, but the back story - the bigger picture - is what I really liked.  Details are slowly revealed throughout the season and it leaves a lot of potential for future seasons to come.  The action is really good and pretty dramatic, although sometimes short and a bit predictable.  To get back to the animation, it does grow on you, and looks amazing when \"zoomed out,\" and while not the best one must simply accept it as a part of the show and probably allowed this series to be made in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nIn all, I liked Knights of Sidonia a lot.  It was well worth watching, and I think a 7 fits my general feelings and leaves room for improvement.  I expect better from Season 2 and whatever else might come from the series and I hope to give a higher score to future seasons.",

Everything surrounding this anime was amazing, before I go any further, for anyone still hesitating on watching this anime, just stop and watch it. You will have no regrets and as I am right now, you will be dying for more.\r\nThere is no point in me writing a summary upon the story as the synopsis basically covers most of it, but I will say it'ssuch a unique and brilliant idea, you will be shocked at every episode. I NEVER EVER read the manga/light novels that're based upon anime, but this will I will be reading the book that this anime originated from.  - 9!\\n\\n\r\nArt - When I first started to watch this anime, the art style really caught me off by guard, in a good way of course. Something about the style is so much different to the normal anime that I usually watch, it felt much more sophisticated and elegant. Sure, there were some scenes where I felt the art might be lacking a tiny bit, but for the overall anime it was superb. - 10\\n\\n\r\nSound - I'm not really too sure what to say about the sound on this one, I mean, the voices suited every character and the sound of gun shots sounded perfect also. The music and the beginning and end sounded beautiful as well. - 8\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The only real character I felt in touch with was the main character, Nagate Tanikaze, I'm not sure why but I felt whilst watching this anime you where the main character in some sense. Such as when he went into the mecha and you could see the console. It's as if you where in there with him. But every other character really stood out when they where the symbol for certain parts of the anime. - 8\\n\\n\r\nI usually skip the enjoyment part and move right onto the overall paragraph, but this time I think I'll tell you how much I truly enjoyed it. \\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment that I truly felt was phenomenal, the ability to get absorbed  into the anime was truly amazing, it was certainly fulfilling whilst watching the anime. I think the most superb part of this was how much of a surprise it really was to me when I decided to watch it, it felt as if I should open my mind a bit more and start to enjoy more anime that is based around these genres. -9 \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you've read up to here, you can see how much I have praised the anime and I certainly cannot wait for the next season of this anime. However, I do hope they don't slack on this next season just because of the good reviews that they've received! - 9\\n\\n",

            "content": "The show started off great with an origin story that drew me in as we began to explore the solitary existence of Nagate Tanikaze aboard some sort of derelict space colony. It reminded me of the feeling I had when I watched 'Moon,' which I enjoyed immensely. In retrospect, I think we didn't get to see enough of Nagate's day-to-day life but the show can easily fill that void with flashbacks in future episodes. I'm particularly interested in seeing how he managed to survive all those years after his grandfather died. \r\nIn any event, the audience soon realizes that Nagate's world is considerably larger thanwe previously had imagined and that he was actually living on a deserted sector of a space station called Sidonia, humanity's last refuge after the destruction of Earth. My memory's not helping me here but I believe I saw a reference to there having been other similar space stations at one point and that Sidonia had developed along the lines of a Japanese culture since its original crew was mostly from Japan. If that's the case, it would suggest each country or group of countries built and launched their own Sidonia-type vessel, not unlike the Arks built in the movie '2012.' I would definitely love to see an episode or a couple of episodes devoted to explaining the origin of Sidonia and whether there are other similar vessels in space.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like about the show is that it draws you in with mystery and the promise of an answer and it delivers. If anything, sometimes the mystery isn't drawn out long enough, like when we learn Nagate has made it into the elite Garde pilot training program thanks to a mysterious benefactor only to find out the identity of said benefactor less than five minutes later. Yet there is a complex weave of secrets and power plays in Sidonia and we learn more about them after each episode. Not to spoil anything but we also learn more about Nagate's grandfather in what's probably one of my favourite episodes, bear notwithstanding.\\n\\n\r\nThe technology introduced is also one of the high points and to its credit the show tries, and more often than not succeeds, in grounding said aspects in real physics. The best example is probably Sidonia's credible use of propulsion and projectile weapons and its effects, though it still resorts to its own physics such as inventing Heigus particles to provide a power source for most of the show's tech. It also introduces interesting concepts such as humans artificially evolving to be able to photosynthesise food, human cloning and engineering, and asexual reproduction, all of which fit the narrative, making them valuable additions to the lore. Even so, I must admit I like the Gardes most of all.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the characters are concerned, it's a mixed bag. Nagate has an interesting backstory but he doesn't have much of a personality outside of combat, at least not until the latter episodes as he starts to gain confidence in himself and his abilities. He has an entourage of girls who are keen on him of which one only seems interested in his combat skills seeing as she has a mind for tactics as well; another is too shy to have anything resembling to growth; with the last one being the better off of the three having developed some sort of relationship with our main character. Unfortunately, things don't go very well for the latter. There's also the required villain, the Draco Malfoy of the Garde training program, who does something so utterly petty, stupid, and unforgivable, that it pretty much destroys any chance he might have had at breaking away from the stereotype. The show attempts to rectify this mistake towards the end but that cliffhanger doesn't bode well.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that doesn't sit well with my is how easily the show gets rid of Garde pilots. At the rate they're going I doubt they'll have enough pilots for more than a season. To my mind, it presents the same problem GoT did for me: since you already know anybody and everybody is going to die, you just don't care for the characters, you don't bother to connect with them. When you see a new character introduced in an episode you're just looking for the tell-tale signs of him being the guy that gets killed because he doesn't have a second name (that's a Galaxy Quest reference, btw), if he even gets to have a name at all. On the other hand, when characters have been around for several episodes, maybe a season or two, their deaths have a lot more impact on the audience that can be used to help us connect.\\n\\n\r\nHow would I rate it? Well, I'd give it an 8/10 (Very good), though it's probably in the 7.5-8 range. Despite some of its flaws, the story, lore, and space battles, were more than enough to hold my attention. Bear in mind that I haven't watched a lot of anime, particularly space operas, so I don't have something to compare it against.",

            "content": "Sidonia was probably one of the best animes I attended in 2014 and one of my favorites that have followed to this day. I never thought I would get used to an animation made entirely in CG. But the story, the soundtrack, the direction and the characters were so good I ended up falling in love with the work. I was very happy when I saw the first season sold enough and even more when it was announced the second season already for 2015. Sidonia is sensational and deserves to be seen almost as an obligation.\r\nThe story of Sidonia in Kishi takes place in adistant future, in a reality that has forced humans to flee the Earth in various spacecraft due to alien attack known as Gauna. Many of these spacecraft ended up dividing and forming their own societies within themselves. The work deals with the ship Sidonia, where residents have developed, in order to survive, cloning, the third sex and photosynthesis superhuman. Its main objective is to find another planet in a solar system that will allow the survival as it was before the earth.\\n\r\nThe plot revolves around Tanikaze Nagate, protagonist who spent years of his life living in the city's unknown underground with his grandfather, who taught him everything about Gaunas and how to defeat them. There he learned to use a simulator of locks they use to fight them, called Gardes. After the death of his grandfather, Nagate was forced and explore more Sidonia to find food, and it is from there that our protagonist arrives on the surface and becomes a Knight of Sidonia.\\n\\n\r\nTo write a good script sci-fi, the author needs to have a strong ability to build a world. Sidonia in Kishi has a large and complex created universe. Both technological and scientific terms as the organization of society and Sidonia culture. And even though this season has little exploited this excellent and promising created partly SnK still had a great narrative momentum. It was simply inevitable reach the end of an episode and do not want to watch the next madly. The anime can easily engage and keep the viewer's attention, either in the action scenes or the moments of tranquility. One of the good narrative impulses anime was in the show that beautiful scenery of outer space and the relationship between Nagate and Hoshijiro.\\n\r\nAnother nice detail of sci-fi is that no other \"gender\" as this allows clear vision in black and white battle between \"good\" and \"evil\", independent of gears and conflicts that revolve around it and the very concept employed in the work. In Sidonia this is also done with great intelligence by Tsutomu Nihei-sensei.\\n\\n\r\nSidonia is not a cyberpunk. It is not intended, unfortunately, exploring the philosophical terms about all the technological changes that employ in the characters' lives and society as a whole. It sure would be very cool if explore more in the political sense all these issues because there really are very interesting. Even the most cited were not developed as human photosynthesis, who came to help the food shortage causing everyone need only once a week go through this process to meet the body needs, as the third sex, which allows person can choose over time if you prefer a man or woman, and cloning itself, a system that keeps your brain alive, but in an immortal body.\\n\r\nIf there's something I too liked in Sidonia was the leisurely pace that anime had. Despite the many action-packed moments, the whole story was told quite calm and serenity, about to leave the feeling that this season was just an introduction to the real conflicts and reflections that everyone will face just ahead. This moderate pace also matched perfectly with that cold work. Yes. Sidonia in Kishi is cold. The people are cold. Humanity is completely different. And all this coldness is nothing more than a proper reflection of modern society in which they live.\\n\\n\r\nBut after all, what they seek? Salvation? A new planet in a solar system as was the Earth would be, yes, victory in this great battle for the salvation of the people of Sidonia.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime Sidonia in Kishi was undoubtedly a wonderful surprise. I never thought it was so good. You can easily notice that everything in the story is well done and thought that the plot really has something more than several works there. This 12 episodes were wonderful and from what I saw adapted very well the original material. The anime was a hit in Japan, already having even announced the second season, not to mention who painted here in our Netflix!\\n",

            "content": "In terms of the western market, the anime industry has been accelerating at a rapid rate since the reintroduction of Toonami to the television lineup in 2012. On the TV front, we had the first instance of a dub premiering at the same time as its original subbed version with Space Dandy at the beginning of this year, and even more progress has been made with the introduction of FUNimation's Broadcast Dubs this Fall, allowing fans access to the top dubbed series months before they would normally premiere. Even those outside the industry are beginningto invest in it. For the first time, Netflix has acquired the exclusive license to stream a certain anime title in the West, and it has already displayed plans to continue this trend in the future. So, how did the very first \"Netflix Original\" anime fare?\\n\\n\r\n          In terms of what type of science fiction this series goes for, it takes on the mantle of very straight and fact-based sci-fi, and the laws of physics and nature come into play very often. Ideas like propulsion and acceleration become key concepts when determining how battles sway and how life prospers on board the \"Sidonia,\" and this ends up making battles a lot more thrilling and exciting because the lack of fantastical plot armor creates some extremely tense situations and often results in extremely high death tolls during battles. This turned what would have otherwise been an extremely generic plot into a captivating experience.\\n\\n\r\n          That being said, the truly generic nature of the plot itself is nearly unbearable at some points, and I found myself making a gagging motion whenever the standard dialogue clich\u00e9s started popping up. There were also a lot of points where things just didn't make any sense. Without spoiling anything, there comes a point where Nagate messes up during a mission and it causes a big problem. Then, after the mission, one of the other soldiers actually beams him in the head with a rock. Now only was this infuriating on the level of \"this crap probably wouldn't fly in an actual military,\" but also on the level of \"here's that clich\u00e9d plot point where everyone hates the main character after he messes up, but then he does really well in the next mission so they're ok with him again.\" And, I kid you not, there is actually a montage scene where they flash between different moments on Nagate's rise up in power and respect within the military. This is just a sample of the unbelievably terrible writing that takes places between the epic thrills of each battle.\\n\\n\r\n          Characters really don't do much to differentiate themselves from their standard tropes either. Nagate is probably the most fleshed-out of the cast, but even his background of living in the underground alleys of \"Sidonia\" felt a bit generic. From there on out, between token love interests with no personality other than \"love interest,\" and a quite literal bully character with very few redeeming qualities, the characters really don't do much to make themselves stand out. Character interactions also feel a bit forced at times, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the fact that there are enough main characters fawning over Nagate to fill a small harem for any other anime. By the time they had added a fourth love interest, my eyes were about to swivel back into my head so hard that they'd fall out of their sockets.\\n\\n\r\n          And then, there's the bear. There is literally a talking bear with a robotic arm that actually gets to be a main character...just let that sink it for a minute. I don't know if this was their attempt to insert some kind of comic relief despite the fact that the bear never does anything comical, but if it was, then it worked just about as well as every single forced comedic relief scene in this series.\\n\\n\r\n          The animation was produced by Polygon Pictures, and to my knowledge, this is the first television anime series to be animated completely in 3D rendered models. This ended up creating an incredibly stark contrast in animation quality. On the plus side, the action sequences were some of the best I've seen from this year, with every single movement choreographed and animated to near perfection. The heavy attention to explosions and particles effects also added a great deal to every fight, though some felt less realistic than others. On the reverse side of this category, any animation that wasn't a fight sequence ranged from incredibly mediocre to unbelievably awful. The characters have an extremely limited range of facial features, blushing and crying looking extremely jagged and unnatural, and any sort of body movement looks severely robotic and completely destroys any attempt at immersing you in this story.\\n\\n\r\n          On the dub front, I actually couldn't tell you who exactly dubbed this series, but I can tell you that we have definitely found a fundamental flaw in Netflix's business plan for original anime series. I do have to give credit to Johnny Yong Bosch and Todd Haberkorn (credited as Todd Stone) though, but saying that those two were good in a dub is practically unnecessary since they've been voice acting legends for at least the past decade. Unfortunately, aside from a minor role by Spike Spencer (Shinji of Neon Genesis Evangelion), I did not recognize a single name on this dub cast. Upon further research, I discovered that a good portion of them had never even done any anime voice acting before they were cast for this series, and the effects of this were plain to seen. I personally was able to slosh through the dub because it's a heavy action series and Bosch can in fact carry an entire cast by himself, but I would not blame you in the slightest if you switched to subbed while watching this. Hopefully Netflix will learn from their mistakes before they begin their work on The Seven Deadly Sins.\\n\\n\r\n          The music was composed by Noriyuki Asakura of Rurouni Kenshin fame, and his mastery of soundtrack composition has certainly evolved since the late 90s. Battle sequences were always accompanied by grand and epic orchestrations mixed with heavy guitar work and electronics, while more intense non-battle scenes often carried creepy electronic elements; I will say that I felt somewhat unmoved by some of the softer tracks though. The opening theme \"Sidonia\" was performed by angela and plays us in with a heavy techno beat back by a march-inspired feel, while the ending theme \"show\" by Eri Kitamura plays us out with a heavy rock track. Additionally, both of these tracks are available for purchase on iTunes, and I would definitely recommend checking them out.\\n\\n\r\n          Overall, I'm once again left in a quandary over whether or not to recommend Knights of Sidonia. There are a ton of really, really awful moments in this series, yet I was still able to watch the next episode without any pause for a break. Ultimately, I'm feeling a bit generous towards it since it's the first anime exclusively licensed by a streaming company outside the direct anime industry, and any attempt to promote and expand anime in the western market should always be given a chance.\\n\\n\r\n          If you like heavy action anime, then definitely give this one a shot, but otherwise stay clear of it.",

Knights of Sidonia is an anime that is very similar to AoT, so this review can be summed up here with:\r\nKnights of Sidonia = Attack on Titan in SPAAAACEE.\r\nAnyways, the defining characteristics with this show from the other shows are that it was made entirely made in CGI (at least I didn't see any non-CGI portions). I really liked this because it made the art style consistent thoughout the anime, and it helped immerse me in the anime. \r\nKnights of Sidonia is a Netflix original series, which is pleasing to find,because it shows that Netflix is willing to delve more into the anime sections of its library (add more anime series Netflix!)",

            "content": "With some very strong titles like Cowboy Bebop and Ergo Proxy somebody could say that the sci-fi section of anime is long gone. Fortunately Sidonia no Kishi comes to prove this theory wrong. The main concept of this anime is simple (mankind at the edge of extinction and humans fighting against monsters in order to survive) it reminds a lot SNK's plot but it stays interesting in it's own way. A lot of things remained unexplained and the ending is preparing us for a huge cliffhanger that is going to happen in the next season. The thing that made this anime stand out among theothers was the fact that it was made entirely by CGI animation a thing that made a lot of people drop it. After watching it have to say that this is the biggest mistake somebody could make. While not a big fun of CGI animation myself I have to admit that the animation studio did an excellent job with this anime. The world of Sidonia as well the outer space are beautifully animated same goes with the character design . There are of course some flaws like some lagging movements in a couple of scenes as well as the kinda weak Gauna design but the animators put such an effort in their job that they have gained my respect. The opening was a really awesome battle anthem that enters you into the anime's atmosphere and the ending was pretty catchy and very fitting for every episodes conclusion.The OST's were pretty good too especially the battle theme. I had a little problem with the voice acting though. The VA's sounded a little bit off in some scenes but overall they made a descent job. The biggest problem of this anime was the character section. The story is developed only around the main protagonist Nagate. Nagate is the one who will defeat the Gauna, Nagate is the one that will get all the fame and girls (the anime can indirectly labeled also as a harem anime XD) and everything in the story will be ''Nagate this'' and ''Nagate that''. Either way the story unfolds somewhere in the middle why Nagate is getting all the acknowledgement but still I would like to see a little bit more of a character development in the other characters too. Overall this anime was very interesting and despite it's minor flaws be it on animation or in the plot I had definitely a very good time. I can't wait until April!!!",

Yes, it terms of art style, you can see it is heavily influenced by Ghost in the Shell and the Japanese cyperpunk genre. However, the uniqueness of Sidonia no Kishi is the meticulous drawings of the verticality of the residential buildings within Sidonia, which seems to be contextual but in factthe main playground of the artistic style.",

The character designs for the cadets in particular are extremely similar, almost clones of one another (11 are sisters who all look like twins), which makes it difficult to keep track of many of the cadets except poor Tanikaze and his rival, Kunato. A possible jealousy-laden love quadrangle between the four leads (Hoshijiro, Izana, and Midorikawa) feels a bit contrived.\\n\\n\r\nBut the world-building and space battles are definitely gorgeous, fun, and meaningful, and I hope a third season is in the works!",

            "content": "Knights of Sidonia / Sidonia no Kishi\r\nReview By: John Fragglepuss Evans and Breanne Evans\r\nEven though Knights of Sidonia is based on the survival of humanity, the story focuses on the inner workings of the Sidonia and its leadership. The story can move slowly at times, but the end reward is well worth the watch. There are several interesting concepts with the new race of humanity. For example, due to a lack of food they have developed a way to use photosynthesis to receive their nutrients, meaning that they rarely eat. Another interesting concept is that there is a third gender. It is a neutral genderthat makes it so when a person finds a mate, they can become the opposite gender of the mate that they find.\\n\\n\r\nYou might enjoy this if: You enjoy drama and mystery in space.\\n\\n\r\nYou might not like it if: You want a good laugh. They are few and far between.\\n\\n\r\nNote to the Viewer: The animation style is unique and beautiful. Pay extra attention to it while you watch.",

            "content": "So many of my friends, and some who I consider to have good taste in anime, recommended Knights of Sidonia to me, so I came into it wtih high expectations, always a mistake. After the first episode I dropped it for awhile, but my curiosity over the large purple space monster pulled me back in.\r\nKnights of Sidonia is a gorgeously animated sci-fi 'Last of the human race in a colony ship' series with entertaining space battles and perfect use of CGI. unfortunately, that was about all it had to offer.\r\nStory:\r\nThe conflict with the Gauna is pretty much the extent of the story here, which isfine considering that the show is about the struggle to preserve the human race due to problems caused by the Gauna in the first place. However, this meant that the parts of the show devoted to other things, to the pilot's free time, just felt like a waste. The world of Sidonia, while beautiful, wasn't developed enough to make me feel like it was an actual place. I could have derived a similar amount of enjoyment from looking at an art book of this series.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the Gauna destroyed earth in the year 2371 CE and several colony ships scattered into deep space in an hopes that humans might one day colonize another planet, but the ever-present Gauna threat means they will have to be dealt with before humanity can achieve that goal. Throughout the series, I didn't get the sense that anything was progressing aside from humanities ability to combat these giant space monsters which affirmed the fact that the Gauna conflict was the only thing actually happening. There are vague hints at political unrest but it's ultimately unimportant in the grand scheme of things.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorite parts was when three of the characters explored the city and reading Sidonian lore, I though this might lead to something interesting that wasn't space battles but it ended up tying right back into it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nNone of the characters were particularly memorable, in fact, after watching it recently I can only remember the name of one.\" NAGATE!\" screamed every girl he had ever met while staring in horror as the Gauana wreaked havoc in a manner reminiscent of Krillin gaping uselessly at Vegeta using his powers. Unfortunately, this isn't DBZ, and that trope is inexcusable in an action anime that takes itself seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationships between characters is almost Victorian. The sexual tension is so awkward it's hard to watch and everyone is stoic to the point of not having a personality at all. There's a girl with green hair and a mole who actually gets some character development but it's not enough to relieve the frustration.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the biggest issue is that all the characters are part of the military despite the fact that they are hopelessly ill suited to combat. They make irrational decisions, shut down in the face of danger, and behave in ways that are outright detrimental to themselves and their comrades, in and out of combat. The commander actually listens to her pilots when they have a good idea, which was a nice break from the constant barrage of authority figures in most shows who never listen to anyone ever.\\n\\n\r\nNagate's character is actually okay. He doesn't have much going on other than being a really good pilot, but that's okay considering he's lived underground his whole life with one other person, and devoted all his free time to pilot simulations. It makes sense that he'd have zero social skills.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation & Direction (Space battles):\\n\r\nThis is exactly what I want to see out of a mecha, space battle anime. While it isn't really a mecha show per se, all of combat takes place inside them. The problem I have with mecha (and most action anime) in general is amount of time spent shouting the names of your moves, charging energy, and flashing lights without any actually action. The combat is fast paced, pretty to look at, and easy to follow. It's never chaotic, and things can only be hard to follow because every mech looks the same. However, this fits in with the uniform, militaristic style of the show, so it's not a problem at all. It's hard to put into words how well done the combat is because it's so rare to see anything like it. This was what kept me coming back along with the desire to learn more about the Gauna.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Design:\\n\r\nThe character design is realistic and consistent. Not a single character's design break immersion. Realistic hair color (even the green haired girl's hair is muted eough to not be distracting) , and similar faces, you get the impression that they have homogenized over years of cloning/being grown in test tubes. Unfortunately, they are also pretty similar and easy to get confused because of it.\\n\\n\r\nStyle/Aesthetic:\\n\r\nLike I mentioned before, Knights of Sidnoia depicts consistent realism. It never deviated from this despite the space battles and Sidonia being drastically different, both in terms of pacing and content. This brings me to my next point.\\n\\n\r\nPacing:\\n\r\nI don't know if it's because the characters mostly lacked personality, or the absence of world building, but the segments of the show spent in Sidonia, which comprise most of the show, are really, really slow. There needed to be something other than shots of generic looking characters walking through gray hallways and reserved, uninteresting dialogue and there just wasn't. I wanted to see Sidonia, I wanted to learn about it's inhabitants, but I got almost nothing in those areas.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nFantastic sound effects. Never have I heard weapons with so much Oomph. The sound really conveys just how devastating these weapons are. The score was properly dramatic for a fast paced robot vs. massive alien space battle.\\n\\n\r\nIntro/Outro\\n\r\nThe opening theme was perfect for the show. I wasn't crazy about it, but I acknowledged that one would be hard pressed to find a more appropriate song. The ending theme was a little energetic and dramatic for the tone of the show, but sounded cool.\\n\\n\r\nIf anyone knows of an anime with animation on par with this show that actually has interesting characters, an intriguing story and decent world building, please let me know.",

            "content": "SPOILER REVIEW\r\nCharacters are more important than stories. However, if a story is very good, and the characters inside serve their purpose well enough, then it can still scrape by. Knight of Sidonia manages to make me care about the outcome of the character's struggles even though I don't really give a crap about anyone in particular. That's a rare thing, and should be commended.\r\nSTORY: There's something primal in this show that forces me to care. Desperation. Their struggles with an eldritch force that threatens to wipe them out at every turn is survival at its core, and that's something everybody can relate to. They don'tneed to build up some dramatic struggle between morality and beliefs to make you care, you care because you can relate so well to what they're going through.\\n\\n\r\nThe battles really are the highlight of this show. They are masters when it comes to conveying desperation. At the beginning of every battle, everybody's focused, morale is high, and they have a plan ready to go. Then, they start taking casualties. The plan falls apart at the seams. People start panicking, some act out of turn because their friends are dying, and all their professionalism melts away in the face of terror. The people of Sidonia can do nothing but sit and listen as their defense force suffers more and more casualties, and pray for their survival.\\n\\n\r\nThe Gauna never stop being a threat in this show. They inflict major casualties on every single squad that's deployed to attack them. Every single time, the survivors just limp back home, traumatized. This is a nice change of pace, considering how many other anime sort of ditch the supernatural creatures being a threat partway through.\\n\\n\r\nI was startled to realize during the climax that I actually cared about a character who seemingly was about to die. Not because I liked her, mind you. I couldn't even remember her name. But she was the one giving orders around there. If she died, then the whole mission would fall apart, and everybody on the squad would die. Very few anime nowadays have made me genuinely scared for somebody.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: Not special. In any way. I can't remember anybody's names, BUT they do their job well. For instance, I felt genuine sympathy for one of the side characters in episode 2, where she reflects on how her family and friends all pinned their hopes on her as she's about to be consumed. I felt  angry when a character got someone killed out of pure jealously.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorite episodes in this show was when the MC is stranded in the middle of space with another character. They built a relationship up not through talking or ecchi moments, but by relying on each other for comfort in a very trying time. The relationship was so believable and well developed that I felt genuinely sad when the character was killed off next episode, and I sympathized with the main character's emotional state afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters all work by being relatable. They have no other distinguishable character traits other than being human, and that's a sadly rare trait in anime. Unfortunately, there aren't many other traits, so I can't give character that good a score.\\n",

Some of the characters I found were good, but the lack of love and screen time to background or support characters was disappointing. I don't wanna spoil anything, but I was attached to one character in particular and had gotten kinda angry about it later. \\n\\n\r\nArt- WHOA, IS THIS CGI?! Yes, yes it is. BUT WAIT. its not that bad. I actually thought the art style was VERY well done. Of course your always going to have moments where its very obvious and sticks out like a sore thumb.\\n\r\nThe art style was actually very fitting. Characters looked neat and well designed, and were animated very well. I do think Polygon studios took advantage of no gravity for some moments where their movements are...less than elegant, but it seemed natural anyway. Environments were very well done and the theme of Sidonia was kinda scary and sad, while at the same time looking extravagant and beautiful.\\n\r\nThe color palette was not too bland either, showing off a diversity of the spectrum in some areas more than others of course, but having the environment fit the mood of the scene really well. \\n\\n\r\nSound-  I was not impacted at all by the soundtrack. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't amazing either. However, when there was a scene that really REALLY needed a good BGM, it was. Asakura Noriyuki composed the soundtrack, and he made it fit very well within the setting and it would not be too much or too little. The style was really good, I'll give him that.\\n\\n\r\nStory- I for one, have not seen a story like this. It was really good and you actually kinda worry about how the protagonists are gonna make it through this. Later on they introduce a very important plot element that they unfortunately could not elaborate on, but a second season is confirmed now and I for one can't wait to see how that unfolds. Most of the story centers around Nagate Tanikaze, as he is the protagonist and is foreshadowed to be very very important despite how the rest of the characters make him look...average.\\n\r\nOne thing that did bother me was the pacing. The show actually starts right up and gets you hooked immediately, with their being a deployment in the first episode and seeing the kind of horror their facing. However, after a few episodes they slooooow dooown and do some character development. Not that character development is bad, it was only because the show had immediately hooked you in with the action and the awe of the first couple episodes only to stop entirely for about 4 episodes. Then after that, its deployment after deployment. I may also add in just this quick line, all of the \"sci-fi\" in this show, is all completely plausible. (barring perhaps the photosynthesizing...although.. >.> )\\n\\n\r\nand finally, the mechs- Their...nothing special. Their really not. Take in mind, I do not consider this a bad thing, but something you may care about. All of them, are the same. Same design, same weapons, same capabilities. This is not Gundam. However, I love how they used them. The Garde's could join together to get more thrust of out their engines. By join together, I mean they literally held onto each others arms in what they call a clasp formation. Much of the technology uses  Heigus particles (Higgs Boson particles) to do one thing or another. The most seen and obvious use of this, is in the Garde. They are more or less \"lasers\" to simplify it. The armaments on the Garde's fire compressed Higgs Boson particles. The Garde's engine also runs off these very same particles and if in emergency, the Garde can deploy \"sails\" to catch and story more particles.  As it turns out, the main antagonist of the show are also made primarily out of these same particles. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, its a good show. I thoroughly enjoyed it and have been trying to get my roommate to watch it with me...and I dont even particularly like this kind of genre. 7/10",

Most of their plots are a mix of horror, crime, action, tragedy and many other genres so i often claim that anime overshadowed many highly funded films. And now let\u2019s continue to our new show Knights of Sidonia, it comes from the workshop of Starchild, was made following manga written by Tsutomu Nihei which has 12 vol (2009).\r\nAnime follow the story thousand years after the destruction of the solar system by alien race called Gauna.Part of humanity managed to save itself using enormous \u201cseed ships\u201d like the Sidonia. Nagate Tanikaze is a young man who has been raised deep in the bowels of the ship. When he goes into training to pilot the huge robotic weapons known as Gardes, Nagate is entrusted with piloting the legendary unit known as Tsugumori. Nagate and his fellow pilots put their lives on the line against the Gauna, in the ultimate battle for the survival of humanity!\\n\\n\r\nIn the first episode Nagata was caught stealing rice, while trying to escape he got hurt and ended in hospital, in fact, he often find himself in the hospital. While he was under the city with his grandfather, on the surface there are now three genders of people, man, woman and third parties whose bodies adapt after choosing partner. The graphics are excellent and the music complements awesome to make really good atmosphere, i hope you will enjoy watching this truly refreshing anime.",

            "content": "Knights of sidonia-an anime made by netflix. That alone got me pretty stoked to watch this, honestly who thought it would be any good? Well, I can quite honestly say it was. At first, the anime might put you off-awkward character designs that are clones of each other and terrible voice acting so none of the words are in sync. They used 3d rendering as opposed to normal 2d for most anime, and this explains the awkward character design, but where these types of animations excel are within the space scenes. they are so incredibly detailed and have depth so all the gauna appear largerthan life. Its a double edged sword, as it makes for weaker character designs but unique and epic space fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSo for a pros and cons list, here it goes-Very in depth story with a few sudden plot twists, but very plain jane bland characters to help support them. They say a lot of lines that sound like everyday conversation at a grocery market, which is slightly annoying because some of the character actions are pretty interesting. Like all the immense planning that comes into defeating every single gauna and the factor that theirs always some cost associated with it-I mean large scale sacrifice. This actually makes the story a bit intriguing as the character actions are always associated with some sort of sacrifice, which is almost like a sub-theme here. (this is mostly where the attack on titans comparison comes from probably). \\n\\n\r\nSound is used super sparingly in the anime itself, but as for intro and outros the Beethoven-techno intro is pretty cool and grand. The outro is slightly metalcore in addition, like a watamote intro. \\n\\n\r\nSo did i like this anime? yes. Did i love it? no. Theirs alot of room for improvement, and i hope they expand upon this in the 2nd season. Its good for any sci-fi fan most certainly, or if you even like mech animes. Great action and a pretty realistic take on a very unrealistic story are what make this anime worth watching.",

            "content": "I\u2019m not entirely certain what the point of this anime was. It presents itself as a more realistic version of mechs in space, which is potentially appealing, but more \u2018realistic\u2019 seems to mean that it just drops the insane action sequences that makes mech shows so absurd/fun in the first place. And in its place they put... nothing. Nothing at all. The show feels like an empty shell.\r\nIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s nothing positive to be said about the series. The starfighter squad sometimes works in a vaguely Battlestar Galactica way. By toning down the extreme personalities they provide an opportunity for a more serious lookat what life as a combat squad is like. In space. But like so many of their good ideas they just waste it. In fact, I\u2019m going to list all the good (or at least potentially good/interesting) ideas and what they do with them:\\n\\n\r\nHumans have been engineered to survive mainly on photosynthesis.\\n\r\nUsed to make Toyosaki\u2019s nonphotosynthetic eating habits stand out. And nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nDead people are recycled for... nutrients I guess?\\n\r\nToyosaki\u2019s  vaguely scared by the idea.\\n\\n\r\nThe ship\u2019s acceleration requires people to hook onto walls or be thrown to their deaths.\\n\r\nWe do actually get a pretty cool action scene out of this.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s an entire ocean above them.\\n\r\nThey use it to go on dates. And nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a third gender now.\\n\r\nGoes absolutely nowhere. Not even a romance really.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not a show devoid of ideas, just one that goes nowhere with them.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is weird and takes a biit of getting used to. It basically looks like a JRPG, with digital characters being manipulated to act out scenes. I suppose it saves them the money they\u2019d have to use to correct these designs digitally, but it does look odd. Characters look identical as part of the efforts at \u201crealism\u201d. Everyone has black hair and a typical anime face. Except the villain and one random girl. Honestly, I can only tell the two main girls (or rather one girl and one third gender) apart by the size of their breasts. It\u2019s that bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is typical mech stuff. An evil alien race destroyed Earth and is now chasing the surviving ships. Sidonia is one of those ships and the inhabitants have found a way to kill the enemy using mechs armed with a rare type of metal. The fight scenes are brief and basic. Extreme fight mechanics have been erased. This means that there\u2019s never any real thrill to the battles. Sometimes this approach leads to interesting ideas, like an entire episode spent trapped in space in a powerless mech. More often it just means interminable dialogue that establishes nothing.\\n\\n\r\nI dunno. I wanted to like this but I couldn\u2019t even make it through the first season. It just didn\u2019t have any substance. And without substance and without mindless fun... what\u2019s the point?",
