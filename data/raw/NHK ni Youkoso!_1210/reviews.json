            "content": "Outstanding thing. Some times it was amusing to watch, sometimes it was painfully. \r\n    \"Welcome to the NHK\" is a kind of collection. Collection of troubles and problems we can meet in our life. It doesn't perceive as anime. It doesn't perceive as something fictitious. It is life. Hateful everyday life gets emotional colors and draws a wide reaction with slowly walking real life on the our side of screen.\r\n    In \"NHK\" everyday events are not shown grotesque and mockingly as in parodies and not weightly depressed as in psychological thrillers but somehow chaotically andtragicomicly &mdash; you want to weep, smile, think ironically and philosophize simultaneously. Every joke provokes not a roar of laughter but the sad smile as you recognize yourself and your troubles in &quot;fictional&quot; heroes.\\n\\n\r\n    Even if you have a job, relatives, interests, it doesn't change anything. You aren't able to get rid of solitude if you feel your purposelessness and pettiness. If you laugh, you laughter is insincere. If you cry, you wail. Problem of self-concept and fear of the life is urgent for many people, but the feeling of hopelessness and despair appears only when there is nobody to support you. You've got tired from struggle along on your's own not at once but gradually. It happens little by little but it does. There are no N.H.K., there is no god, there are only nonchalance, loneliness and despair. You think that people around get everything easier and live merrily and sociable but you simply can not see the same as you as they also are dissociated from the world. It is impossible to meet for such humans but only they can understand each other. It is very hard and cruel. In &quot;NHK&quot; it is shown somehow exaggeratedly but the inner life is described entirely faithful. Psychology is described as much as possible faithfully, all the reasons are named correctly, emphases are placed where they needed.\\n\\n\r\n\tArt and sound do for this work and don't have any serious shortcomings. All the aspects of this anime are high qualitative.\\n\\n\r\n\tSuch masterpiece anime must be a conspiracy... Conspiracy against what?",

            "content": "Welcome to the N.H.K. is the story of a 22-year-old hikikomori/NEET named Satou Tatsuhiro.\r\nMore than half of you are probably wondering what a hikikomori is; So that explanation should probably come now before getting into the review of the series. The dictionary definition of hikikomori is \"a state or condition of acute social withdrawal\". The number of people living the hikikomori or NEET (Not pursuing Employment, Education or Training) lifestyle are increasing everyday worldwide but they are predominantly concentrated in Japan among the adolescent male population. The hikikomori are basically shut-ins. They feel uncomfortable in presence of other people. They don\u2019t leave their rooms/houses unlessthey absolutely have to and make just enough money through various means (parents, relatives, jobs that can be done from home, and rarely part-time jobs outside the house) to survive and continue their hikikomori lifestyles.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character of the story, Satou Tatsuhiro, is a college dropout. He is a complete conspiracy nut who believes a giant organization encompassing the whole planet called the N.H.K. (Nihon Hikikomori Kyoukai / Japan Hikikomori Association/Society) is working around the clock to ruin his life and make sure he stays a shut-in forever through any means necessary. The origin of his obsession with conspiracies seems to be an upperclassman named Kashiwa Hitomi with whom he spent a lot of time with in high school. Satou realizes that he can\u2019t continue living as a NEET forever and wants to escape the lifestyle and overcome the conspiracies of the NHK but he is too afraid and doesn\u2019t know how to go about it. However, everything changes when one day he meets a girl named Nakahara Misaki who claims that she will save him from his hikikomori lifestyle if he agrees to sign a contract with her and become the subject of her \u201cproject\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a very serious subject matter but it is still full of humorous moments. The creators of the anime realize that the best way to convert such a serious subject matter into an enjoyable anime that will not only entertain the viewers but also educate them is through humor. That being said, the anime is also full serious and sometimes very sad occurrences. If you happen to be an emotional person, be prepared to shed a few tears or at least feel downright horrible watching some of the episodes of this series. The story progresses at a fair pace with a good mixture of serious episodes and some not too serious ones.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well designed and although I have never actually met a hikikomori, I would guess that the personalities and lifestyle are fairly depicted. For me, the most notable character in the series is the female lead Nakahara Misaki. She remains a mystery for almost the entire series and refuses to reveal any personal details about herself to Satou. Even when asked directly, she makes up obvious lies in order to avoid divulging anything personal. Her actions leave the viewer wondering and guessing and although that becomes somewhat annoying at times it contributes to the story coming together quite well in the end. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters \u2013 \\n\\n\r\n Satou is your \u201ctypical\u201d conspiracy nut shut-in (or what you would imagine one would act and feel like). While his hikikomori lifestyle doesn\u2019t seem to be as severe as some other people\u2019s, it is bad enough to keep him from functioning as a part of society and most of his ventures to the outside world seem to end with him becoming completely scared and freaked out.\\n\\n\r\n Satou\u2019s only male friend Yamazaki Kaoru is your typical anime/hentai/game otaku. He is obsessed with all sorts of things the most notable of which happens to be echii games. He is very passionate about his obsessions and becomes easily enraged by the smallest things especially if they have any relevance to his obsessions. Needless to say, he is an amusing character to watch.\\n\\n\r\n Satou\u2019s upperclassman (senpai) Kashiwa Hitomi is a complete conspiracy nut like Satou. She seems depressed most of the time and even sees being happy as a sign that she is playing into the conspiracies. She is a supporting character in the series, but plays an important role in the development of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is nothing spectacular but the voices fit the characters well. The same can be said about the music. There is no ground-breaking piece of music in the series. There is however a somewhat catchy anime song that is played throughout pretty much the entire series. Do be careful not to get it stuck in your head.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animations are at best average. You won\u2019t find any great-looking characters and the animation can be sort of clumsy at times. I can best compare the art to \u2018Great Teacher Onizuka\u2019. However, it looks slightly better and animations are done at a higher quality. That being said, the art style does fit the series quite well. I can\u2019t imagine the story represented with any different kind of art style.\\n\\n\r\nATTENTION: The next paragraph talks about the ending. While I will not include any specifics about what happens at the end of the series, I will talk about the style and quality of the ending. If you feel this might spoil things for you, skip over the next paragraph.\\n\\n\r\nThe story ends. That sounds like a weird statement, but most of you know that in many Anime series that doesn\u2019t happen and it\u2019s always a letdown when this occurs. So rejoice; this one actually concludes. It is the ending you will likely suspect part of the way through watching the series with a few twists and turns before it gets there.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Welcome to the NHK is a well-written and well-told story about a serious subject matter. It has a good pace and just enough of both humor and sadness. I enjoyed the series very much and if it is a type of anime you normally enjoy, I am sure you will love this series as well.\\n",

            "content": "Are you new to anime? Or are you a veteran? Well, with \"NHK ni Youkoso!\" it doesn't matter! This is one of those anime that you can easily get through, want more, think about it's message and wonder how such a masterpiece isn't more popular. Not only does this anime entertain it's audience with a wonderful story, a variety of characters, great sound affects and great music, but it also teaches the viewer about the difficulties of social anxiety and psychological disorders. There are only a handful of anime out there that handle such delicate subjects and shower them inbrilliant dark comedy. Anyway, before getting too worked up in my intro, let me start my review. \\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10)\\n\\n\r\n     Unique, complex, entertaining, slow paced and utterly brilliant. The story of this anime is so beautifully constructed, executed and structured that it took me a while before realizing how amazing it really was. The synopsis is already provided so I won't be summarizing anything here. In fact, I'd recommend reading the synopsis before continuing to read the rest of this review. The story telling in this anime is such a roller coaster of emotions that it's honestly pretty exhausting sometimes. Most scenes had me in the brink of tears from either laughing too hard or watching something painfully realistic and relatable. It starts off with a lot more comedy in the beginning, but the further you go, the more bittersweet moments you find. The romance is also pretty realistic in the sense that you'll NEVER see the main couple be LOVEY DOVEY. I think some people might dislike this anime a lot because it doesn't necessarily rely on the suspension of disbelief like other anime. True, there are a lot of weird/funny hallucinations the main character sees and hears, but almost all of the situations throughout the anime are believable. Anyway, this isn't the only anime to tackle on the whole \"society is a bitch\" idea, but it's one of the few to actually do it in such an efficient, painful, smart, and entertaining way. Honestly, I could go on and on about the story, but I think you guys get my point by now. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\\n\r\n     Before judging the artwork of this anime, keep in mind that it was released in 2006, almost a whole decade ago. Although it's not the prettiest artwork or the most innovative, but I do think the artwork fits the genre and story perfectly well. With that being said, there'll definitely be moments when you'll be thinking \"wow this anime is a lot more beautiful than I thought\". Just like the themes, the artwork has this extremely grungy, old school, somber feel to it. It also reminds me a lot of Cowboy Bebop for some reason. Which obviously makes this anime that much more awesome. All kidding aside though, there is also a good variety of artwork throughout the anime. You'll notice a difference of quality in scenes depending on the setting. Scenes where Tatsuhiro is at the beach, the park, or in the city are a lot more visually pleasing than when he's at home. Facial expressions on every character are also unique and interesting. Overall, the artwork perfectly suits the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\\n\r\n     The opening and ending songs of this anime are really good. Not my personal favorites, but easily in my top 20. That aside, the quality of the voice acting in this anime is ridiculously high. Each voice actor feels like they're perfectly suited for their role. The sound effects during hallucinations are great and most of the time extremely hilarious. My personal favorite by far is our main character, but that's only because he gets the most screen time(duh). Music during scenes are perfectly intertwined with the situations in the anime. With music you sometimes forget it's there. However, if you've watched anime for a while you can't help, but notice what a big role it plays in most scenes. There's a wide range of music that vary from playful to extremely sad and depressing. It's pretty stunning. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\\n\r\n     This is probably the strongest aspect of this anime. Each character has a purpose. Every character grows, fails, learns, and maximizes their potential as a solid character. There is no such thing as a \"weak character\" in this anime. It's actually unbelievable how well written, well developed and well exposed every character is and how that justifies their existence. Not a single character feels extraneous or even annoying. It almost feels like every character has tragic hero qualities. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) \\n\\n\r\nI LOOOOVVVVVVVVEEEEEE THIS ANIME!!!! It's definitely on the same level as Toradora, Lovely Complex, Kimi ni Todoke, Clannad/Clannad: After story, Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai, etc.  It's worth watching, re-watching, purchasing, and remembering. It was painful to watch, it was hilarious, it was bittersweet and underrated. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nNotes: I did write this review a few weeks after watching it, but my feelings and perspectives towards it have not changed. I loved it and would recommend it to anyone looking for something unique and highly interesting. I'm not going to lie, you have to be a little mature to get some references and relate to it fully.",

            "content": "First, let me say that I saw this entire show in a period of 3 days. So, that in itself says something about how enjoyable it was. If I wasn't having a good time watching it, then I wouldn't have bothered doing 12 episodes in one day. :)\r\nThe story is pretty well done. It basically traverses through Satou's rough life as a hikikomori and his various means to combat it. There are a few episodes that I had issues with, as they were quite \"okay...this is really cheesy\". But, overall, the episodes went well with the life of someone who is afraid to go outsideor be in large crowds.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is top notch. Absolutely no qualms with anything in this department.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was probably the best part about this show. Great opening and decent ending. The background music and \"main theme\" were awesome too. I'm pretty sure I'll end up grabbing the soundtrack for this series. Very catchy tunes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters...were well explained I think. There were a lot of gaps in my opinion though as quite a few things are left out in the open throughout the show. We don't learn much of anything in detail about the cast either. We learn plenty about Satou and such, but I think they could have done better with \"reasons\" and stuff like that.\\n\\n\r\n2nd thing I loved about this show was the comedy. Freakin' hilarious scenes everywhere. Satou and Yamakazi are great together and will have you rolling on the floor laughing countless times. The jokes are original and none of that lame crap that \"younger audience\" anime titles might throw at you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, very good series. The ending was well done too (though it left me wanting a bit). Pick this up, you'll have fun with it.",

            "content": "I was expecting a dark Satoshi Kon style satire on hikikomorism; the dehabilitating affects of media as represented by the NHK broadcasting company and post millennium conspiracy theories, but instead this anime merely uses hikkomorism as a backdrop for melodramatic relationship angst and blues.\r\nThere's no satire, no NHK broadcasting company, and no conspiracy.  Why this show is even titled the way it is, I don\u2019t know.  The main character only mentions the NHK a handful of times and only in passing, there's no actual focus on the broadcasting company itself.  The name is just an abbreviation of the main character's conspiracy theoryspouted here and there.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no deep exploration of hikkomorism, as this anime would fool people into believing it does; the condition is just the Big Quirk (tm) of the character, who suffers more from being a NEET than hikikomori.  In fact he spends more time outside than inside his room during the 24 episodes.  Shame on the writer also for having the recovery process kick-started by a cute girl coming out of nowhere and helping the loser protagonist no matter how pathetic he is.  Anime screenwriting is just masturbation.\\n\\n\r\nOther drawbacks of this show are innumerable amount of contrived coincidences, and plot lines wrapped up so quickly and neatly they might as well have CGI'd a freakin' bow onto them.  The main character is written like such an oaf, he is by far the dumbest person on the planet, and probably one of the dumbest in the history of anime too.  And it's purely for comedy; but it\u2019s not funny at all, just tiresome to watch his stupidity move him from one plot point to another.\\n\\n\r\nI gave this show a personal non-review score of 8 which means it entertained me, and ultimately it does avoid climaxing into a generic cliche; having the grace to show how life is just too great for some of us to handle in the end.  So contrary to what I've written so far this isn\u2019t a 'bad' anime at all.  It just falls short in so many ways and could have been something different.\\n\\n\r\nThis story could have been special; it could have been an actual compelling look at a real illness plaguing Japan and could have made the protagonist beat it without the help of a girl, and then this anime could have been an encouragement to actual hikikomoris watching it.  I don\u2019t know how well the anime followed the source novel, but regardless the writing is at fault, which is ironic considering the main protagonist is also a lousy writer.  We can expect too much from anime sometimes, and must be sadly reminded that there are only a handful of writers, directors, and producers in the industry who don\u2019t follow convention and trends, and stand firm to deliver creative and challenging work.\\n\\n\r\nAs unique a backdrop as this anime has, it is neither creative or challenging.",

            "content": "Welcome to the world of mental disorders, in which everything looks colorful yet mundane. It is a world that lets affected people transcend the borders of the ordinary by allowing them to impose their very own interpretation of the world upon the circumstances that surround them. This way, people learn to cope with their sometimes unpromising situations by making use of their powerful minds alone.\r\nThose who have a profound knowledge on the functioning of the human psyche including the process of dissonance reduction probably understand the importance of the NHK to exist. Ultimately, that what constitutes the NHK and other conspiracies (in the case ofSatou and Kashiwa) as well as god (in the case of Misaki) is nothing else than the need to externalize the guilt people feel when confronted with their misery, and to consequently appease their minds in order to keep going.\\n\\n\r\nBasically this is one possible interpretation of the message that NHK ni Youkoso! tries to convey. Despite its comedic appearance, this show deals with one of the most significant topics on social behavior in Japan that even consistently gains in popularity among western societies, and delivers nothing else than mind-blowingly deep engagement with the psyche of four very different characters and the extent of their mutual influence on an emotional and cognitive level.\\n\\n\r\nNHK ni Youkoso! is the only anime I know that manages to get a good grasp of how it is really like to suffer solitude and the inability to escape this mental condition by the means of one's own actions. However dramatic this subject may be, it is the more fascinating how entertaining and easy the method is that NHK ni Youkoso! uses to not let the viewer fall into despair himself, but to rather encourage him to reflect on his own lifestyle by simultaneously enjoying the sometimes hilarious happenings in the lives of the main characters. This series tries to demonstrate that there is always a way out of social isolation and self-pity, and that it is not rocket science to develop one's very own coping strategies.\\n\\n\r\nBut, as many other great series, NHK ni Youkoso! is not perfect, not even in storytelling, which shows especially in rough transitions between various minor arcs trying to thematize very different issues socially inept people have to deal with. This leads to a somewhat staccato-styled storytelling, with its story broken up into several pieces and being not fluent enough to be considered a realistic tale. A very inconsistent implementation of romantic elements adds to this and makes me question the characters' attitudes. As a result, the story feels very different before and after episode 9. A sudden change in atmosphere is something that, in fact, often works for anime like these, given the sheer unpredictability in the behavior of mentally unstable characters. In NHK ni Youkoso!, however, this led to my disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I couldn't rate this show as high as the story would have deserved it lies within the technical dimension. Although the soundtrack is distinct and fits very well to the not-so-much-desperate, but rather ironically enjoyable atmosphere that underlies the show, the visual arts, especially the key animations, were done really sloppily. If you have watched Ping Pong The Animation, you know that there are obvious ways of selling sloppy arts as a kind of new style. This doesn't work out for NHK ni Youkoso! however, since the drawings are inconsistent in general. Characters are drawn very sharp and detailed at one time only to be dissolving in the background at another. This is something I regard as bad quality, unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, NHK ni Youkoso! is a fascinating work that is not only interesting to those who suffer the same fate as any character in this show, but also to people who are just interested in the functioning of the human psyche. This series depicts the strangely easy way people cope with their mental and personality disorders in an immensely entertaining, sometimes absolutely hilarious, but also emotionally involving manner. It makes you reflect on your lifestyle and potentially delivers answers to questions you didn't know you've had before.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 8.33/10\\n\r\n(A quantified evaluation can be found on my page.)\\n",

            "content": "There exists something rare in this medium. In fact, its so rare, that only a handful of titles have managed to do this and still make the anime work. This trait is called realistic chemistry of characters. In a fictional work, it's virtually impossible to create relations so genuine, that it is almost frightening to experience when you do so. You are aware that what you're witnessing is made-up, but can't help comparing the characters' life to yours, as well as the struggles they encounter.\r\nThis is where Welcome to the NHK shines, and they don't hold back in making you feel like you are partof the story; while being unable to help those who are suffering. It's a terrible feeling, and if you're weak-hearted, I do not suggest you to watch this show: it's simply too powerful.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of NHK is rather straight-forward: a guy lives in his room, away from society, and we get to see how he deals with new-found dilemmas; or, that's what they expect us to believe. In fact, it's nothing about that at all. The story develops into being much more about world conspiracies, proving how fake the world is, as well as the human condition when dealing with  rejection and denial. We are brought into this world where everything seems to be against our protagonists, including their own families.\\n\r\nYou can comprehend the story in two ways:\\n\r\n1. Mostly Comedic\\n\r\n2. Mostly Depressing\\n\\n\r\n1. Many people believe that the humor that NHK holds is the bread-and-butter of the show, and thus cannot be taken too seriously. Like this, when the show is seen to be getting more serious, they treat this change of heart as dramatization. The problem with this way of thinking, is that it highly undermines the show itself. NHK has many comedic moments, which may or may not be understood as dark-comedy, or simply comic-relief. These people tend to state NHK as being over-dramatic and thus overrated.\\n\\n\r\n2. The other group of people, including myself, see the basis of comedy as  a minor genre of the show. However, this group sees the comedy as being dark, so it adds to the depressing overtone, instead of taking it away. Like this, I do not believe that NHK is dramatized at all, instead it's flavor being added. People more accustomed to anime are more likely to belong in this group, thus the show is recommendable to both newcomers as well as veterans of the anime community.\\n\\n\r\nGetting that out of the way, as stated in the introduction, NHK places emphasis on world-conspiracies. They structured this very well, combining the male protagonists backstory with this train of thought. It deals with human psychology in ways very unique to anime, without including paragraphs of monologue which can be very irritating if done wrong or in excess. Everything betrays Satou, which is very depressing to watch. It's like watching a train that is heading towards a person, you know what's going to happen, and you feel powerless against it. While watching the show this feeling was so mutual, that I had to take breaks just to ease the pain.\\n\r\nThe story is not perfect however. While being very realistic and innovative ,the ending was bittersweet. And not the kind of bittersweet of which you can walk away and say \"Well, at least it was satisfying\". They could have explored further into the relations of the characters, but what we got as what we got: a cliffhanger.\\n\r\n There were also many arcs in the story which felt very out-of-place and were slightly unnecessary in my opinion. In addition to this, the pacing was questionable at times, there were moments were I felt it was going too slow and fast respectively. But for the most time, the pacing was on-point.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nA series cannot be made depressing without a great cast of likable characters. The way this works, is that the more likable a character is, the more painful it becomes when you watch them meet an obstacle.  As stated at the introduction, the chemistry of the characters was so well done that I felt like I was eating a steak made of ice (bad jokes are bad). But seriously though, I couldn't believe my eyes; it was as if I was witnessing the lives of real humans, where every struggle and dilemma have a reasonable impact to the characters, as well as the audience. You felt so condensed with the characters that it was like you knew them for many years. So as a result you really don't want to see them get hurt.\\n\r\nI will now evaluate the characters individually:\\n\\n\r\n1. Satou\\n\\n\r\nHe's your main male lead, and straight from the bat he's likable and highly relatable. He's the story's main focus, and we watch him deal with his everyday struggles as a hikikomori. ***SPOILERS***We witness him being rejected by him parents, almost commit suicide, become addicted to visual novels and RPG's, and living alone without any friends, suffering from day to day.***END OF SPOILER*** It's as if the viewer is Sato himself and you are experiencing his life through his eyes. How did they do this, you ask? I have no idea, but he is one of the best written characters I have ever witnessed.\\n\\n\r\n2.Misaki\\n\\n\r\nShe is the main female lead who, at the start, seems to be your everyday one-dimensional character. It's only until later in the story where we find out her backstory and thus we are able to dive deep into the psychology of her characterization. This is purposely done so that the emphasis is given to Satou instead, thus we can empathize with him first. The same technique was used with Misaki as her backstory was uncovering, and her presence became more necessary. Without including any spoilers, she makes the anime that much more depressing than it already was.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, when I stated the chemistry being golden, it's between these two characters and the romance that follows. It's not your typical love-interest. The characters develop thoroughly throughout the length of the show, and this is done through struggles and leaps. *MINOR SPOILERS*Misaki tries to help Satou into getting out of the zone he finds himself to be in, while returning him back to society as an everyday functional human being.*END OF SPOILERS* Their meeting was purely coincidental, but the anime portrays this coincidence as fate, rather than chance.  \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are few and far between, but most of them play a large role in the story. I will not talk about these characters individually, because they introduce themselves later in the story, but what I can tell you is that, for the most part, they are not trouped. They have they own struggles and developments, and do not exist as a means of comic relief, for the most part.\\n\r\nHowever, there are a few side characters that are more useless than not, and can be quite irritating to watch. A key example is Kobayashi Megumi who was not pleasurable to listen to and had no real purpose for existing.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 5\\n\\n\r\nSadly this is were NHK falls, and boy does it fall. For the most part, NHK's art is on-par with the anime at the time, and was relatively fluid, although lacking detail. BUT, there were episodes were the quality decreases so much ,its ridiculous. We have no detail here, literally stick-men. Gladly these episodes were a minority; but the consistency is inexcusable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nTHOSE TRUMPETS. THOSE GLORIOUS TRUMPETS. The opening of NHK was wonderful and highly nostalgic. It fits the tone of the anime second to none, and I am glad they did not change it (although the trumpets were removed for some odd reason). The first ending song was unique and intelligent, showing off the dark humor, as well as the psychological aspect of the show very well. The second ending was fantastic, as it was sang by the same artist who performed the opening, and thus had a similar vibe to it.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was excellent: exactly what you would expect when watching an anime in Japanese, but I cannot say the same for the English dub, since I have not watched it.\\n\r\nThe OST sadly did not stand out to me as much as everything else. There were a few songs that were fantastic, but these were played too many times throughout the length of the show, which is a shame, because you tend to notice these things when watching NHK.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nI loved this show, but because it was so depressing to watch, I did not want to see what would happen next due to the pain of experiencing something so genuinely saddening. The huge lack of budget in terms of animation/art as well as overused OST's decreased the value of enjoyment as well, but these are nitpicks. The ending was not complete to my liking, but was still a fantastic closure nevertheless.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nA fantastic show that is highly nostalgic. I would only recommend this to those who can handle watching 'tragedies'. If by ANY MEANS you have a weak heart when watching depressing shows, PLEASE skip this one, unless you're watching just for comedic purposes. Otherwise, simply enjoy the brilliance that is NHK, which in my opinion, is one of the best non-monologue-inducing psychological titles anime has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review!

            "content": "Every now and then you come across those shows that just strike you with a sort of emotional response you rarely get elsewhere. It's not a directly tragic response, it's more a gentle, melancholy feeling - a poignant way of portraying reality for what it is - not a happy optimistic place, not a place where you're guaranteed a bright future, but a harsh place that some people find so hard to deal with they shut themselves away from it instead.\r\nThe main character of NHK!, Satou Tatsuhiro, is one such person. What the Japanese call a hikikomori (from wikipedia: \"h. is a Japanese term torefer to the phenomenon of reclusive adolescents or young adults who withdraw from social life, often seeking extreme degrees of isolation and confinement.\"). He dropped out from college, has no job, and he spends his days locked up in his apartment living off his parents' allowance, only going out at night to buy food and goods from a local convenience store. On top of this, he has a firm belief that everything is a conspiracy, right down to why he is a hikikomori (he believes that an organization known as the Japan Hikikomori Organziation, or the Nihon Hikikomori Kyokai (the titular NHK) exists and has the one and only goal to produce more hikikomori).\\n\\n\r\nThen one day he meets a girl, who happens to know quite a lot about him. A variety of circumstances eventually leads to him being a part of a 'project' this girl has devised; one aimed at curing the hikikomori condition. Now, the \"troubled boy meets girl and everything slowly improves, interspersed with some drama\" story line isn't exactly what you would associate with something good or brilliant right off the bat, but the means by which NHK! handles it is anything but mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nChiefly, for me, this reason lay in its thematics, the way it handled the various issues it crosses. While it mainly deals with the issues of a shut-in lifestyle, it touches upon many other issues: Dealing with an unfulfilling life, ambitions that never came true, how to face life and its ramifications, wanting to end one's life - and many more in that line, all of which can be cooked down to one simple thing: Reality kind of sucks. It's a harsh, often unforgiving place where you don't get anything on a silver platter. Happiness and success are both goals that lie far away, in high-reaching places, and it's hard to get there. NHK! manages to portray this poignant realization of reality with evocative storytelling and brilliant charaters.\\n\\n\r\nDealing with such heavy themes, of course, can become quite a lot if that is the sole focus of the series. Thankfully its makers had the sense and wits to insert comedic relief, and at very appropriate moments, even. It manages to retain a slightly light-hearted tone without ruining the concept or derivating from the thematics, and that is a very big accomplishment in and of itself. Not only that, but the comedy is consistently of high quality. There's no reliance on stupid fan service, moe antics or predictable escapades from stupid characters who's only there to serve as comedic relief.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, every character you see in NHK! has a very well-placed purpose within the plot, they are of high quality and are enjoyable to watch. Satou is a well-balanced character; he's a college dropout and a hikikomori, but he is not a stupid idiot who hangs around for comedic relief nor is he shallow. The scenes where he reflects on his time in high school with his senpai, Hitomi Kashiwa (who also believes everything is a conspiracy), are very nostalgic in their nature and points to a character who knows that his life is askew, who knows that he's on a bad road, who wants to turn, but it's hard. Life is unforgiving and once you're off track it is not easy to get back.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast are just as good as characters; the good-hearted yet mysterious Misaki who wants to help Satou recover from his hikikomori ways, his galge-obsessed neighbor Yamazaki, his old high school senpai who's obsessed with conspiracies, and then some - all of them play a very important part in Satou's story, but never once are you left with the feeling that they are not good characters in their own right. Watching them go through the miseries of their existences, reacting to and developing from all that; it is very, very evocative.\\n\\n\r\nEvery one of these characters has a grim story to tell, something that bogs them down and makes their lives hard. But never, even once, do their troubles, their drama, feel forced or unnatural. It is all extremely poignant, it feels right and it is handled very skillfully, as we progress through themes such as abuse, family troubles, reality escape, failed ambitions, obsessive thoughts, depression, self-loathing, loneliness and even suicide; all handled with immaculate care and presented quite brilliantly. \\n\\n\r\nThe series' soundtrack is absolutely impeccable; it does the job that a soundtrack is supposed to do perfectly; bringing life to the emotions of the series. The melancholy, the loneliness, the fun and comedy; NHK! has the right songs for the right places, and also features a drove of insert songs, something rarely seen in anime - and generally very effectual, as is indeed the case with this series. I also greatly enjoyed the series' opening and ending themes; Modokashii Sekai no Ue de by Yui Makino has written itself onto my absolute top list of anime themes.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality is overall solid but it does not quite live up to the standard of the rest of the series. It does have a rich colour palette and its background work is generally solid, but at times the character designs feel rather askew which does detract a little bit.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all though, this is the best show I have watched in a very, very long time. The quality of its story, characters and its thematics was fantastic, and the lasting sensation of melancholy the series brought forth in me is something I have not experienced in other fiction to date. Well done!",

It is a story about a hikikomori and NEET (Not currently engaged in Employment, Education or Training) named Tatsuhiro Sat&#333; who struggles with who he is and just getting through daily life.\rStory: The main plot is about Sato receiving special training from a girl named Misaki Nakahara on how to break free from his hikikomori ways. Overall there is quite a depressing tone and it convey's realistic internal conflicts and struggles that the characters face. From start to finish it never seemed to stray from itspurpose, which was among other things, to paint a picture of the hikikomori lifestyle.\\n\\n\rAnimation: Although the animation is generally good, there are a few cases during the series (entire episodes) where the quality of animation really goes down. Other then that it is good and consistent.\\n\\n\rSound: I very much like the music, the opening and endings are very enjoyable and background music is very fitting and keeps up with the overall depressing tone of the series. None of the voice acting really stands out, it is well done and the voices match the characters rather nicely.\\n\\n\rCharacter: The characters all seem very realistic. They all have problems that they have to deal with and many of them are not above selfish desires. Many of the characters take advantage of Sato's trusting, even naive nature, which often leaves Sato in predicaments. I believe that keeping the characters in this anime realistic is important for it to deliver its message, and it does so very well.\\n\\n\rEnjoyment: I enjoyed watching this anime from start to finish, it is quite unique and it was interesting to see if and how Sato could overcome the problems he faced. Fans of the drama and slice of life genre's should really check this out I think, although there is some comedy it isn't a primary genre.",

Then his life is suddenly turned around when some girl decides to cure him of his hikikomori ways.\r\nThis series starts of confusingly enough and it seems to flows at a very slow pace as it introduces the main characters and the overall plot of the series. However from the start it is pretty difficult to understand exactly what this is all about, because it doesn't do things in a way mostanime series does. It's only until a couple episodes into the show that you can truly understand the nature of this anime and that is of the various psychological and social issues each character is faced with. What makes it so interesting are the different psychological disorders that are shown and the way they are realistically expressed by the characters like Tatsuhiro Satou being a &quot;hikikomori&quot; and Misaki who's trying cure him but she is obviously messed up in the head as well. With all the serious issues in this anime, it's quite refreshing to see all the hilarious antics they get into, whilst still retaining a sense of realism.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for this anime suits it perfectly with a great deal of detail put into the backgrounds and environment. Although the characters do appear to look a bit off quite frequently but this can easily be over looked due to the nature of this show. The music also helps a lot, with plenty of weird melodies to go with the baffling moments and the catchy opening themes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Welcome to the NHK is really an anime of its own, with nothing to compare it against. This anime is able to realistically show many different problems that the Japanese society is facing with and in the process make you laugh whilst keeping you intrigued throughout. Yet due to the unfamiliarity of this anime, not all anime fans will be able to get into it. So if you want to find out what it means to be a hikikomori, then check this out.\\n\r\n^_^",

It's got a truly great mix of laughs, cringes, tears, light romance, stress, and all manner of feels. The series ultimately sums up all of the ways a modern man could be truly pathetic, and presents it in a way that makes us all contemplate, laugh at, and root for ourselves.\r\nThe series follows Satou Tatsuhiro, an active shut-in of four years, a raging narcissist (despite knowing how pathetic he truly is), and a borderline schizophrenic conspiracy theorist. It shows Satou'sdaily struggle to maintain his status as a NEET, while the world around him keeps trying to pull him outside.\\n\\n\r\nNHK moves in several chronological story loops, which each span 3 or 4 episodes. Some are purely comedic, some comment strongly on social issues, some are dark and depressed (although still very funny in their own terrible way.) The story progresses as Satou places himself into situation after situation that depict very real issues today, but are also just the most outrageously frustrating places to be. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, I went into the series blind, and it smashed its way directly into my top 5, with perhaps my favorite anime protagonist ever.

            "content": "I have long heard that &ldquo;Welcome to the NHK!&rdquo; (which I will call WttNHK for short) is a fairly good anime with strong comedic elements. This is an understatement. What lies beneath the superficial surface that WttNHK posits itself to enclose are a myriad of thematics pertaining to human interaction, societal repression, and the core motivations behind human behaviour. Let us explore:\r\nStory- WttNHK is about a young man (Tatsuhiro Sato) who quit going to college after he believed he was being bullied by his peers. He thus shuts himself in his cramped apartment for about four years, going outside only at night to shop forcheap convenience store food. He lives off an allowance provided by his mother and father, who are largely unaware of his current lifestyle. Sato&rsquo;s stagnant lifestyle takes a dramatic turn when he meets the young Misaki Nakahara, who makes it her mission to relieve Sato of his status as a &ldquo;hikikomori&rdquo; by making him sign a somewhat juvenile contract stating that he must meet with her for counseling every night, or pay a fine of one million yen. The plot also involves other characters including Sato&rsquo;s neighbour, Kaoru Yamazaki, his old sempai from high school, Hitomi Kashiwa, and his old class president/representative, Megumi Kobayashi. These characters all interact in what would typically be seen as nothing more then comedic melodrama. This, however, is only half the story. WttNHK goes far beyond the average slice of life anime to bring us what is perhaps one of the most realistic, touching, and dark plotlines one can hope to find in an anime. \\n\r\nSome of the more prominent themes and ideas that are divulged include the notion of societal repression in a modern society and core emotive motivations behind human conduct. Sato&rsquo;s state of being a hikokomori, which he generally acquiesces, is explored in great detail during the show. By doing this, a great deal of direct allusions to Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, and other psychologists are made by Misaki herself as she hopes to discover the origin of Sato&rsquo;s hikikomori state of mind and potential solutions of how to &ldquo;cure&rdquo; it by assimilating him back into the workings of modern society. WttNHK thus generally implies that the typical modern lifestyle is a positive one and that humans should generally live their lives in accordance with the status quo. However, it paradoxically claims that such of lifestyle is a negative one through the very fact that some of the shows more intelligent and congenial characters reject the status quo by either becoming a hikikomori (Sato),  planning to commit suicide (Hitomi), or using computers games or doujin eroge as a means of escapism (Yamazaki). This debatable paradox is what makes the show quite alluring to most viewers, whether is occurs on a subconscious or largely conscious level. The state of mind is also examined in considerable detail as well- mostly through the lens of psychology. For example, the fact that Sato constantly misinterprets the actions of those around him and hostile or even tyrannical suggests he is repressing traumatic experiences from the past and quite obviously possesses an inferiority complex. I could go on, but must stop myself for fear of digression. \\n\r\nThe other dominant aspect of WttNHK is motivations behind human behaviour. In most cases, this is examined through the characters&rsquo; love lives, but also seen through why certain characters would choose to take part in largely illegal or thanatic activities. The latter can be seen in the characters of Megumi and Hitomi respectively.  Megumi enters an illegal pyramid marketing scheme because she claims to have to provide for her hikikomori brother, when it is revealed that she really just felt a need to secure her place within the economy by possessing a stable job. Hitomi wants, and attempts to, commit suicide because she feels neglected by her fianc&eacute; and thus comes to the (irrational) conclusion that she would rather cease living rather than live in a world where she is afraid of being indirectly by her beloved. It is through these examples and the ones that I will present in the next few sentences that I would suggest WttNHK presents a somewhat bleak and austere interpretation of human incentives, since all the characters&rsquo; actions essentially stem from personal selfishness. Characters&rsquo; love lives are revealed to be quite dysfunctional in this sense as well.  While Misaki ends up genuinely having feelings and loving Sato in the end, it is revealed that she wanted to help him in the first place because he was the only person in the world that she believed was more miserable and unsuccessful than herself (which she directly states numerous times in the show). Yamazaki&rsquo;s potential love life with a girl from his college is destroyed after he becomes overly suspicious of her intentions and comes to the irrational conclusion that she actually loves another man. This stems from the fact that since a girl cheated on him in the past, he believes it will undoubtedly happen again in the present. He is thus guilty of committing the fallacy &ldquo;post hoc ergo propter hoc&rdquo; (false cause). This is relevant to many of the situations that may arise in one&rsquo;s life, especially as the mature and form meaningful bonds with others. Since the many viewers can identify with the characters and their motivations in the anime, they feel sympathy (pathos) for the characters and become all the more engaged with WttNHK&rsquo;s story.\\n\r\nThe plot does have a few weak points (which I won&rsquo;t point out since many of you probably are tired of reading this and don&rsquo;t care at this point), but they are largely overshadowed by the anime&rsquo;s strong, pertinent themes, meriting my rating of the story to be a 9.\\n\r\nIn the end, I hope I have at least convinced you that WttNHK does have legitimate depth, even though you may not agree with some of my conclusions. I encourage those interested in looking more into the plot of WttNHK to read some of the other reviews on this website- many of them are quite juicy. \\n\\n\r\nBecause most of my energy was expended by discussing the plot, and I am sure most of you are tired of my ramblings, my comments on the art, sound, character, and enjoyment of the series will be relatively short, but long enough that it will hopefully give you a good idea of what the WttNHK holds in store for you prospective viewers under these categories. \\n\\n\r\nArt- WttNHK was fairly strong for the most part, as it realistically portrays average Japanese citizens without hyper-sexualizing or drawing attention to the characters in ways that most anime tend to (e.g. giving characters odd hair colours). The animation is smooth for the most part and the bright colours used in the foregrounds and backgrounds of many scenes do function as an effective allure for viewers in most circumstances. However, one will not find much, if any, truly exceptional artwork or animation here.\\n\\n\r\nSound- WttNHK&rsquo;s background music was consistent and did not become tiresome  by the time I completed the series. There was one background song featuring an acoustic guitar that I particularly enjoyed, as it helped to enhance and give life to many of the anime&rsquo;s more depressing scenes. Opening and ending songs were mediocre at best (although the ending theme &ldquo;Odoru Akachan Ningen&rdquo; did have some pretty good lyrics) and all sound effects seemed to be in place*.    \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- WttNHK does an excellent job of resisting conforming to the cookie-cutter stereotypes that many anime seem to recycle time and time again. There are no clearly distinguishable tsunderes, Naruto-types, little-sister types, or ENFs (embarrassed nude females) here, unless they are being used specifically for hyperbolic or comedic effect (such as the hilarious Purin-chan, with her mighty theme song). This keeps all the characters fresh, interesting and likable as they interact with one another in a natural, realistic way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I cannot remember one episode where I found myself checking the time remaining before the episode was over while it was playing. If you do not understand what I mean by this, it means I really enjoyed watching this wonderful anime and was completely drawn in by its comedic, yet serious, and intelligent plot. It was definitely a pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- In the end, WttNHK is a great anime that perfectly combines strong comedy with more serious themes pertaining to human behaviour and the effects of a modern society on the individual. WttNHK effectively comments on these ideas without impeding its core emotive storyline in the least. I recommend that whether you are into comedy, drama, and/or psychological anime, you should definitely give &ldquo;Welcome To The NHK!&rdquo; a watch.\\n\\n\r\n*In all honesty, does anyone really actively listen for sound effects during anime? From what I can remember, one of the only anime that had exceptional sound effects was &ldquo;Ghost Hound&rdquo;.\\n",

            "content": "Here it is, people. This is no hyperbole. NHK is the worst anime of all time. It is one of the worst pieces of media you can conjure. A reality show about the Kardashians must be better than this. Pathetic YouTube parodies are better than this. In order to make something worse than this, you\u2019ll need to let Ian Watkins brag about his pedophilia in the Lostprophets album that was never made.\r\nThere is no correlation between artistic quality and morality, as Lostprophets have displayed. Yet, you have to wonder what kind of awful person would subject the world to this. Worse, what kind of personwould make an anime whose purpose is to make fun of anime watchers? Imagine if your ordinary school bully made an anime. There is so much wrong that I want to rant about it, shoot up heroin and watch Texhnolyze. That one was also bad, but it looks like a better version of Digimon Tamers over this, and Digimon Tamers is already brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not sure where to start with this mess, so let\u2019s get with the art style. Art style is important. If not, you wouldn\u2019t use a visual medium. Why, then, are the artists so unimaginative? Something makes me worry it\u2019s on purpose, like those East Coast rappers who are so afraid of sounding \u2018not real\u2019 their beats barely have a drum. Everyone in this series is black haired and has no distinct facial features.\\n\\n\r\nThis may sound realistic, only it isn\u2019t. People in real life actually look distinct. Even if you eschew wacky hairdos, your characters must not look like they came out of the assembly line. There are no odd touches to the hairstyle, different body structures, or an arrangement of facial features that stick out. In fact, the artists are so unimaginative that they can\u2019t come up with a basic sexy design. Our main characters work on an eroge, and the design they come up with can barely touch the most obscure visual novels. Even when they could use anything in the artist\u2019s arsenal \u2013 twintails split into 4, floating hair, purple lips \u2013 they still end up with a dull design. It\u2019s worse than visual novels that have \u2018same face, different hair syndrome\u2019 because at least Da Capo\u2019s girls have pretty hair.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone in this show is also fit and quite hot, despite being hikkies. Satou spent days in his room doing nothing (literally nothing, he\u2019s not aware of the existence of porn). He doesn\u2019t cook for himself and drinks a lot of beer. If you expected an overweight dude who looks like George Martin, you\u2019re bound for disappointment. Satou looks more like Brad Pitt in his Fight Club era with a shirt on and a less aggressive stare. If these guys opted for anything realistic, we would\u2019ve seen the consequences of isolation on Satou\u2019s body. Instead, he looks like a side-character from Free!.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story itself, don\u2019t expect any understanding of what pushes people to be hikkies. Don\u2019t expect a deep, dynamic psychology that reacts to the environment and is an active agent in the story. Any comparisons to WataMote are null, since this is the complete opposite. Tomoko struggled. She was lonely but she had to act and do things. We saw her failures, saw her difficulty and it made it so dark. What Tomoko goes through is our every social awkwardness, only every day.\\n\\n\r\nSatou doesn\u2019t really have to struggle. In fact, he\u2019s not much of a character at all. He has no desires, no life outside the story. He exists so others could pop at his door and force him to get help. It\u2019s not much of a struggle if all you do is react to situations. Sure, it\u2019s not enough to just be offered sex. You also have to go through the dilemma whether to say yes or no to that.\\n\\n\r\nThese are two different struggles. One man struggles with getting something, the other is being offered something and needs to accept it or reject it. The creators aren\u2019t aware of the difference. They don\u2019t know how to let a character drive a story, so they offer external conflicts he has to solve. The dilemma of whether to choose yes or no is hardly there, because the anime relies on events and not characters. If Satou chooses \u2018no\u2019, nothing actually happens. He doesn\u2019t have a personality to move on from that \u2018no\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nSatou, as a character, isn\u2019t an exaggeration. He\u2019s inconsistent. Despite spending years locked in his room, he doesn\u2019t know anything about video games or internet porn or, well, anything. Keep in mind Satou isn\u2019t an Unabomber-style hermit. Hikkies tend to have a hobby that keeps them in the house. Satou should\u2019ve done something during all this time, should\u2019ve gained some knowledge even if it\u2019s only about non-canonical Star Wars planets. He\u2019s completely ignorant of culture that it\u2019s most likely he spent the entire time staring at a wall.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not impossible, but shouldn\u2019t such a person be affected with a major disorder? Shouldn\u2019t that disorder affect every aspect of their life? Socially, Satou is perfectly fine. Whereas Tomoko struggles every second, Satou is relatively confident. The only time social weakness rears its head is when the creators need him to scream for comic effect. Oh look, a hikkie yelled bullshit and emberassed himself! That\u2019s some high-class humor!\\n\\n\r\nThe anime isn\u2019t really about the pains of being a shut-in. The conflict is solved in a few minutes around episode 23 \u2013 no psychology, no development. Suddenly there\u2019s a problem, so Satou walks out and he\u2019s no longer a hikkie. Rather, it\u2019s about the joys of conformity, how the world is a beautiful, welcoming place and you all should stop watching perverted anime and get in line. That\u2019s ironic, coming from a country where people \u2018conformed\u2019 and let the military run the Rape of Nanking and Unit 731.\\n\\n\r\nThe \u2018highlight\u2019, if you can call it that, is the anime\u2019s treatment of suicide. The idea life may not be worth living crosses the mind of the creators for no more than 5 seconds. Except for a brief moment, the creators go hammer about how irrational it is. The people in question have their reasons, but it\u2019s pushed aside using \u2018irrationality. At the end of the arc, some dude goes hammer about how their suicide will harm others and so they should stop. What an original argument. All of the philosophy behind is being shattered to pieces the size of the atom. Too bad the logic that fuels it can also be used to coerce people into rape, but better shut up before the thought police come.\\n\\n\r\nDarkness does exist in this anime, but it\u2019s either skimmed over or played for laughs. Misaki\u2019s and Yamazaki\u2019s darker sides exist, but Misaki\u2019s is barely allowed to surface. By the time it does, it reaches its expiration date and Misaki is the redemption. Her dark side never truly hurts Satou. The monologue that supposedly exposes her is to exaggerated, too comical to be a true confession. Like any other piece of darkness, it\u2019s more funny and has zero insight.\\n\\n\r\nBlack comedy shouldn\u2019t just have unpleasant topics. It should illuminate them. If you\u2019re going to laugh about sensitive subjects, you need to do more than be funny. So WataMote put us in Tomoko\u2019s shoes, dissecting her failures into little details, showing the absurdity and the pain. Even Borderlands takes violence seriously. Some of it is commentary on how lightly we take violence. By shocking us with how casually the characters treat violence, it gives us a mirror.\\n\\n\r\nYamazaki is a lonely dude who\u2019s inept with women. You don\u2019t see his failures, or the pain of rejection. You see him spit monologues about how awesome 2D girls are. It\u2019s quirky, funny and makes you feel good about yourself that you\u2019re not such a loser. Satou\u2019s inner monologues aren\u2019t unhinged enough to show a mental instability, but also not coherent enough to show deep thought behind them. It\u2019s funny that he \u2018hallucinates\u2019 weird, Doby-like things. Perhaps the voice actor is to blame. Satou reacts mostly by screaming, but that\u2019s once in a while. In general, he functions well enough.\\n\\n\r\nWhen they fail, it\u2019s always because they were too weird. The world is mostly benevolent, with the occasional schemer here and there. A few scenes comment on the isolation of the modern world, but it\u2019s always implied the characters brought themselves to this eternal isolation. It\u2019s such an optimistic view, a \u2018pull yourself by the bootstraps\u2019 crap people tell others because they think luck doesn\u2019t exist. Characters rarely deal with failure that\u2019s caused not necessarily because they\u2019re to blame, but because that\u2019s how the world works. Things just sometimes don\u2019t work.\\n\\n\r\nBased on Satou\u2019s situation, he could\u2019ve easily grabbed to Misaki and use her to increase her social skills. As a later character displays, in this world you can do anything if you only try. Said character starves from shutting himself in, so he crawls out and immediately finds a job. What a friendly world that is, where people walk to your door and offer to develop your social skills and where you can apply for any random job and be accepted.\\n\\n\r\nis a ridiculously optimistic anime that refuses to acknowledge the world isn\u2019t a happy happy joy joy place. Characters who feel bad are mocked or written as irrational morons. As we know, everyday other people walk to others\u2019 doors and offer help. What? It didn\u2019t happen to you? That\u2019s odd. Perhaps this anime isn\u2019t so realistic. Perhaps what makes something truly unrealistic is not things that cannot happen. Rather, it\u2019s when the meaning underneath the symbols \u2013 in this case, the optimism \u2013 is completely detached from reality.\\n\\n\r\n0.5 out of 5. I don\u2019t come up with a unique phrase for this crap",

            "content": "Welcome to the NHK (NHK ni Youkouso), first broadcast in 2006, is a fantastic series that mockingly celebrates deviant cultures versus their &ldquo;normal&rdquo; counterparts in modern Japan. This bizarre celebration is presented through a narrative focusing primarily on the protagonist Sato Tatsuhiro, those around him, and the struggles they face&mdash;at the center of which is Sato&rsquo;s concerning status of hikkikomori. \r\nA hikkikomori is different from an otaku, a term you&rsquo;re probably familiar with; the former is a person who refuses to work or spend much time outside the safety of their abode due to their inability to cope with society and pressure, consequently becoming moreand more confined to their quarters and less connected with the world. Their abundance is becoming a real problem, and not just in Japan&mdash;in England, such individuals are called NEET&rsquo;s (Neither Employed, Educated, or Trained).\\n\\n\r\nFor Sato, overcoming this status (which he blames on a conspiring organization known, oddly enough, as the NHK) is conducted by those around him: his endeavoring savior Misaki, his otaku neighbor Yamazaki, his enigmatic senpai Hitomi, and various others. These characters are incredibly dynamic, changing as Sato himself changes; you laugh with them, cry with them, and really get to &lsquo;know&rsquo; them, an aspect many shows&rsquo; characters lack. This cast of Welcome to the NHK is truly what makes the show fantastic, along with its plot, a witty, darkly-comedic satire on aspects of Japan&rsquo;s quirky culture and a touching, &lsquo;slice-of-life&rsquo; chronicle of Sato&rsquo;s struggle. \\n\\n\r\nIn the animation department, Gonzo gives us nothing special. The animation is nothing out-of-the-ordinary or anything avant-garde, background characters are simplified as usual, and there aren&rsquo;t many high-octane action scenes which would require anything intense or careful. However, due to the nature of the show, such normalcy is acceptable. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is another fantastic element of the show, though. The soundtrack (which I strongly suggest you give a listen) is a superb mix of minimal bluesy acoustic stuff, grungy J-rock, creepy minimalism, and progressive J-pop. All four opening and ending themes are great, my personal favorite being the second ending theme, &quot;Modokashii Sekai no Ue de&quot; by Yui Makino. The voice actors, for the most part, are spot on. Sato&rsquo;s voice actor, Koizumi Yutaka, does a particularly fantastic job, which for me was reminiscent of Sugita Tomokazu, Kyon&rsquo;s seiyuu in The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Welcome to the NHK is a solid anime definitely worth watching. It is certainly one of 2006&rsquo;s best non-seinen titles, and a fantastic show to kick back with after a long day.  \\n",

            "content": "I can honestly say that I've never been so happy to be done with a series. This show is barely watchable, and it all stems from the main character.\r\nThe Worst Person In The Entire World\r\nAt first, I thought I'd really enjoy the show. The first 6-8 episodes or so have a unique feel with some decent comedy and interesting characters, but then it takes a turn that it never recovers from. The main character, Sato, is a twenty-something-year-old version of your boiler plate Shinji character, but it doesn't seem that way at first. Don't be fooled; once he starts exhibiting the cliche weak, hesitant, self-centered,clueless characteristics we find in way too many anime, you will loathe him for the remainder of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSato is not a NEET; he's not an hikikomori; he's not otaku; he's just an awful person. Clearly the author believes he's an hikikomori since they need to say that on average 4 times an episode, but throughout the show you will see him constantly switch in and out of being perfectly fine in society and completely scared. You could argue that the switch coincides with how is life is going, but the polarity between the two states is jarring and completely unconvincing. Additionally, even though he's supposed to be a shut-in of 4 years, he has no hobbies that would indicate he's done anything except stare at a wall for that time. He's not otaku, he doesn't play online games, and he isn't even aware that you can search for porn on the Internet.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the show completely unbearable to watch is how entirely self-centered he is. Unlike him, all of the supporting characters have had real hard-ships (some much harder than others). While he remains completely inward-focused, he never asks his friends about their problems or tries to understand what they are going through. This is a man who even raises his fist multiple times to the one person who is 100% unconditionally supportive and caring to him; even when she's in complete tears, he says nothing to her. Instead, he goes home to contemplate how he is affected by what she was saying. Not even a thought about her or what kind of pain she was going through.\\n\\n\r\nThe Saving Angel\\n\r\nAside from the main character, the supporting characters are actually quite interesting. Most prominently, Misaki, is a beautiful person who by far has been through the worst of it. In all honesty, this show could've been terrific if she was the main character. If it weren't because I wanted to see how her story unfolded, there is no way I could've made it all the way to the end.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nCharacters aside, the story had a few problems as well. The biggest problem is that the series takes a few random deviations (kind of like mini-arcs) that are incredibly far outside the realm of the main plot. Including an in-world MMO subplot that lasts a few episodes. They were too distracting, not to mention boring. There were also some major consistency issues as it pertains to the passage of time and the balance of money. You could say these are small details, but the passage of time was to the degree that at one moment the implication was that a month had passed and then just a few minutes later that only a few days had passed.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is also way too long; it could've and should've ended at episode 13. It even has a great climactic feel to it, but for some reason another 11 episodes of misery await.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI love the way the characters are drawn in this series. The art is without a doubt the best aspect of the show. The only thing that was bizarre is that Misaki was the only character that wore the same t-shirt and skirt throughout the entire show. Every other character had different outfits, but even though she actually had a job, she apparently had no wardrobe. There's one part of the show that could imply this was intentional, but I'll avoid a potential spoiler by dismissing it.\\n\\n\r\nComedy\\n\r\nThe beginning of the show has some funny parts; after that, there's less than a handful of parts to get a chuckle out of. You can see where they were trying to be funny, but it falls flat.\\n\\n\r\nExecution\\n\r\nThe visuals and environment are quite nice, and the music is enjoyable too. The voice acting is really well done, and the subs (watched on funimation) were also good. In terms of execution, the show was done quite well.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thought\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend this to anybody who doesn't want to be on the verge of tossing a perfectly good screen out the window. The amount of frustration that comes from watching Sato continuously portray the type of person who does nothing but completely absorb himself in his own misery had me throwing double-birds at my screen over and over again. Do not start this show because you will probably get sucked into something that seems pretty good until around episode 7.",

            "content": "NHK ni Youkoso! or Welcome to the NHK! is something truly special that the medium of animation has offered us. From the fascinating and unique concept to the absorbing and seemingly very real characters, NHK ni Youkoso! has a power to engage and indulge the audience into something that is extremely relatable to oneself. \r\nThe story is focused around a seemingly normal guy named Sato Tatsuhiro; Who's a college dropout and relies on the pocket money given by his parents for a living. However this is just a prerequisite of what actually lies within Sato and that the show tries to explore into and conveyto us -- That is the concept of being a \"Hikikomori\" (A person who tends to refrain from making contact, both verbally and socially to anyone). This is the basic premise of the show as we're treated to a 22-year old NEET (Not in Employment, Education or Training) who's been this way since about 4 years now and is starting to believe that everything happening around him and the also the state he's currently in is the result of a shady and secret organization named \"Nihon Hikikomori Kyokai (NHK)\" or \"Japan's Hikikomori Withdrawal Association\". Things, however, seem to take a different route as Sato soon meets a 17-year old girl named Misaki, who claims that she's gonna rescue Sato by making him participate in a project in order to make him live a normal life again. This project takes on a primary theme in the show and thus making \"Welcome to the NHK!\" a suitable title for this show. What lies ahead is the black-comedy drama which is extremely touching and at times hilarious and ludicrous as Sato and Misaki commence an escapade from this world of social anxiety for Sato, along with a few other friends. Themes of lack of self-confidence, appeasing oneself in a solitary world and various conspiracies stirred out behind the back of people are frequent in this show. \\n\\n\r\nSato Tatsuhiro is the central character of the show who has an illness of being a hikikomori and with whom the whole show is centered around. There is not a proper skill or an attribute that Sato possesses other than being a lazy college dropout with nothing to do. However this does not make him either one-dimensional or typical, but on the contrary it makes it difficult to properly explain his characteristic. You have to guess it yourself, or rather put yourself in his place and relate. And that is something I was able to greatly do, as each an every inch of his character development in the show is closely relatable. This also makes him an interesting main character in a show, someone that you don't quite see that often in an anime. Misaki is another central figure in the show but not a whole lot is revealed about her until the latter part of the show. So much so that it isn't even made clear that why is she performing the project? And why is it Sato that has been chosen for her project? And also, what is the profit for Misaki by doing this project? All we know is that Sato meets her by chance, gets known of the project by Misaki and unexpectedly agrees to it. This doesn't make the viewer retaliate or question against it immediately though as the show tends to the keep the viewer engrossed in it. \\n\\n\r\nTwo other characters play a very important role in the show, Yamazaki Kaoru and Kashiwa Hitomi. Yamazaki was once a junior of Sato when he was in school, and later in the show Sato actually discovers that the irritating otaku freak next door is actually Yamazaki himself. \\n\r\nYamazaki is also an important person for Sato, as he's the only guy he hangs out with all day and talks with. He is depicted as a huge anime fan, and almost 24x7 songs of \"Pururin\" and other stuff keeps on playing in his room fulled with stuff related to anime. As the show progresses Yamazaki convinces Sato for his help in creating a game, which would help both of them if it sells and thus it also acts as a secondary plot in the show. Kashiwa Hitomi is another female side character in the show and probably the oldest and first friend of Sato. Sato usually calls her \"Senpai\" or as senior and she's the head of the literature club which included Sato in their school days. Kashiwa is quite a depressed character, as she believes that everything bad that happens around her is a conspiracy. She's actually the one who may have a influence on why Sato believes that there's a secret organization trying to push him away from society. It's not entirely doubtful that Sato might have had a crush on her since his school days, which isn't the same for the opposite though. Sato seems to have a respect to Kashiwa as he only calls her as Senpai and not her name. \\n\\n\r\nNow this is heading to the spoiler territory a little, so you're warned:\\n\r\nAbout halfway through the show, Kashiwa gets very depressed as she gets a trip planned together with her boyfriend gets abruptly cancelled as he gets called for work, and as a result she takes part in the \"Off\" meeting on the internet, which is a group of lonely and depressed people planning to take their life away in a far away island soon after meeting up. Sato, completely ignorant of the whole scenario agrees to come along with Kashiwa to the meeting. It all ends quite depressingly but also a lot of hilarity ensues and in the end it teaches us all a lesson. Spoilers end here.\\n\\n\r\nThere's another female character and an old classmate of Sato who makes a cameo after halfway through the series, Kobayashi Megumi. Class rep of Sato back in his school days, the little life story of Megumi plays a primary role in the latter part of the show. She becomes an orphan after the death of his father and has to feed herself and her brother all on her own. She gets caught in a shady scheme by some manufacturing company and tries to drag Sato in it too. Sato, of course, gets dragged in it easily and finds himself in a pinch where he has to sell all the merchandise at any cost to earn money. It all comes at a sad end where Sato, accompanied by Misaki and Yamazaki go back to Megumi to cancel the deal and this is where he learns that her brother is also an hikikomori shut-in, albeit in a much more extreme condition that in what Sato is in currently. It has a depressing ending to it but an important life lesson can be learned from it.\\n\\n\r\nComing to the sound section, the audience is greeted by a beautiful opening song \"Puzzle\" by ROUND TABLE feat. Nino. I won't go in to too much details of it but it's a lovely OP which sets the stage for the show. The first ending is a wacky one with insane lyrics and vocals. Very much different than the second ED sung by the voice actor of Misaki herself, and has a lively tone to it. The OP stays the same throughout the show but there's just a slight version edit of it to make it as the second OP theme. The voice acting in the show was satisfying. Sato's voice acting matches his characteristics perfectly and so did Misaki's. I checked out the voice actor of Sato in this site and it turns out that he's only done a handful of shows which was pretty surprising to me. Moving on to the art aspect of NHK. This is the first show from Studio Gonzo that I watched and the art style is pretty goofy at times but it's not bad at all and I got used to it pretty soon. NHK isn't the most aesthetically pleasing shows and the visuals have a minimalistic art style which in fact helps to the premise of the show. \\n\\n\r\nI loved NHK because it uses a real-life phenomenon and a delicate matter such as social anxiety. All the character in the series fared extremely well and it was as if I was in their mind knowing exactly how they felt and this is especially true for Sato. This series also teaches us a lesson that being a \"hikikomori\" is not actually a disease or disorder, but a luxury in itself. The way Sato used to live his life off the money from his parents, and the brilliant ending of Megumi and his brother's story. No matter how bad the hikikomori condition of a person is, but if he/she's pushed to the limit there's no other way to work hard. That's the only way you could truly stand on your own two legs. Welcome to the NHK! needs to be watched to be believed. Rarely did I thought that an anime out of all other mediums would get this close to my heart by the time I bid it farewell. \\n",

            "content": "The word \u201cotaku\u201d used to be extremely derogatory, but in recent years, the word has become a lot less negative with many people (the users of Myanimelist for example) coming to identify themselves as otaku. However, this is still a major problem in Japan.  We have the idea that it\u2019s pretty normal for someone in Japan to obsess about anime and manga. However over there, \u201cotaku\u201d is used to describe someone that\u2019s weird, unskilled, lacks the competence to be in a healthy relationship and/or can\u2019t secure a stable job. \r\nThis is what Welcome to the NHK is about, the story of such an otaku\u2019slife in Japan. This is my review.\\n\\n\r\nContains Minor Spoilers\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe story Welcome to the NHK is about 22 year-old, Satou Tatsuhiro, an otaku/NEET/hikimori. He\u2019s unemployed, sleeps for 16 hours a day and goes grocery shopping at night with money his parents send him. He has the idea that that everyone and everything is against him and it\u2019s supposedly all part of some convoluted conspiracy theory.  He reluctantly joins a program which will help him get over his paranoia and in the process, better his way of living. Welcome to the NHK is part drama, part romance, part black comedy, part psychological thriller, part satire and part slice of life. It shows us the life of an otaku in a realistic way, but it\u2019s able to combine drama and comedy with everyday life. For instance, it explored unemployment in a way where it could make us laugh and think at the same time. Unemployment is a very serious issue all over the world, but I just couldn\u2019t help but laugh at how it was shown in Welcome to the NHK. However it also shows the consequences of unemployment and how it can affect the individual. If it\u2019s from psychological thriller to drama to comedy and back to drama again, the executions of the tonal shifts is smooth and doesn\u2019t come off as awkward because even though Welcome to the NHK falls under so many genres, it manages to have a certain direction of knowing where it wants to go. If it\u2019s serious, it\u2019s serious and if it\u2019s funny, it\u2019s funny. This works because Welcome to the NHK is never all over the place tonally.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nWelcome to the NHK has a distinct look. The characters aren\u2019t that refined. Sometimes their noses disappear and their designs aren\u2019t greatly detailed. There\u2019s not really a lot to say, other than that\u2019s it really simplistic and plain. The background characters sometimes appear as faceless. It sounds awful but you get used to it by the first episode. It has a certain charm, because it isn\u2019t the type of animation you\u2019d often see and the show manages to make it work.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with the English dub. I haven\u2019t seen the subbed version but the English voice actors all did a wonderful job. Chris Patton and Greg Ayres are extremely talented voice actors who seem to embody the roles of Satou and Yamazaki, respectively.  Both of them seem to have chemistry with their respective characters when interacting with one another and just really fit their animated counter parts. While Stephanie Wittels isn\u2019t as well known as the former two, she did a wonderful job as Misaki, coming off as sweet, confident and manages to be cute without putting on a grating voice. Welcome to the NHK has a wonderful opening. Puzzle is just so catchy and upbeat. The remix used as the second opening gets rid of the trumpet which is kind of disappointing because something that small drastically changes ones opinion of the song, which makes you wonder why the show didn\u2019t just use the first opening all the way through. The first ED sounds like a high energy nonsensical rant that\u2019s just not that enjoyable to listen to. The second ED, was actually really nice. Slow and soft, it was just a wonderful track that closed an episode off nicely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nSatou is otaku personified. He\u2019s obsessive, unsocial, unemployed etc. What makes him such a great character is that he has more flaws than perfections. He makes a lot of mistakes. He is someone that thinks isolation is capable of physically strengthening an individual and so decides to break a beer bottle with his hand because of his ridiculous reasoning. He connects dots that\u2019s not there and comes up with conspiracy theories that are laughable. But he tries to better himself. He knows that he can change his lifestyle. He takes control to fix his mistakes and that\u2019s why you love him so much. He\u2019s funny, really weird and goofy, but he doesn\u2019t want to be an otaku. Misaki and Yamazaki are two of the three leads and they were fun to watch. Their interactions with Satou were hysterical. Misaki\u2019s meetings with Satou and the antics of Satou and Yamazaki was just really enjoyable. These were characters that grow on you over time because you feel like they\u2019re just young ordinary people living their lives who also had their own personal problems and hassles to worry about. Like the story, they were down to earth. Everyone else in the story had a part to play. No one ever just showed up to fill up space. They were part of a story, and everyone seemed to have a direct or indirect influence of Satou\u2019s life.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nWelcome to the NHK is very perculiar. Watching it, I noticed, I have never ever seen something like this before. Because of this it took a few episodes for me to fully enjoy it. It was funny, but laughing at the expense of Satou made me feel bad, because it gave me a glimpse of what an otaku\u2019s life is like. It showed me the the daily lives of these individuals, how their psyche works, how they think and how they struggle. You can actually see yourself in Satou because of his flawed nature. All the characters weren\u2019t just moving cardboards and the story was weirdly entertaining. Welcome to the NHK is smart and definitely something that you can watch more than once.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nWelcome to the NHK is one of the most beloved and critically praised anime NOT named Neon Genesis Evangelion. It actually shares quite a bit with Evangelion both for better and for worse as I will explain in my review. Both are series that can be described as essential viewing, thought provoking, meritorious, but also quite frustrating to watch at times.\r\nStory and characters: \r\ncontains some Spoilers!!!\r\nThe main character is Sato, who lives alone in an apartment that his parents pay for. He is unemployed and has no drive to try find a job or interact with the outside world at all. He represents the Japanesecultural phenomenon of Hikikomori that you have probably seen referenced in other anime. There are also many people in their twenties in the US that are unemployed and live with their parents, but that isn't quite the same as Japan's hikikomori. American \"Millennials\" living at home still tend to socialize, drive, and have friends that they often visit. Hikikomori tend to combine their unemployment and dependency with an extreme social phobia and agoraphobia. Part of this is likely due to the feeling of deep shame and fear of being judged that their American counterparts largely lack. Americans will simply dismiss unemployment as the result of a bad jobs market, but to Japanese it is a complete disgrace to both the individual and their families. \\n\\n\r\nSato's life changes when he meets an unusual girl named Misaki, who becomes obsessed with curing Sato of his condition. She forces him to meet with her in the park, where she reads passages from Freud and Jung. Misaki forces Sato into signing a contract and taking up her \"therapy program\". However, she doesn't know that he is going to be an unusually difficult case. In addition to being a hikikomori, Sato is also a paranoid schizophrenic that suffers from delusions of persecution. He believes in a shadowy organization called the NHK, that is obsessed with trying to keep him a hikikomori. In order to convince Misaki that he has his life together, Sato teams up with his otaku neighbor Kaoru to try create an \"eroge\" or erotic video game. Sato briefly tries attending a video game design college alongside Kaoru, but he has another episode of paranoia and can't bring himself to return. \\n\\n\r\nAnother sub-plot is started when Sato ends up meeting his old high school crush, Hitomi. Sato was in his school's literature club with Hitomi, where they were literally the only members. I apologize for that terrible pun! They even celebrated their upcoming graduation by having sex on the teacher's desk one school day afternoon because NO ONE in that school ever went near the literature club apparently. Hitomi has become a successful government employee since graduation, but is frustrated because she often runs into office bureaucracy that stops her from implementing any of the reforms she wishes to make. Hitomi also seems to suffer from clinical depression, for which she takes many pills off label. Despite the fact that Sato looks rather disheveled and has become a complete failure... and despite the fact that she has a very successful boyfriend, Hitomi still flirts with Sato and seems to still have feelings for him. This predictably leads to a love triangle and unpredictably leads to Sato accidentally joining a suicide cult with Hitomi. However, since this is a comedy drama, they are prevented from killing themselves and Sato continues in his struggles. As the series goes on, we also learn about Misaki's background, Kaoru's background, and see the development of the relation between Sato and Misaki.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Music:\\n\\n\r\nThe music isn't amazing in my opinion, but certainly isn't bad either. The art is overall excellent and combines great character models with impressive backgrounds including Sato's many schizophrenic hallucinations. This is a top dollar production, so you would expect it to look phenomenal and for the most part it does. \\n\\n\r\nIssues:\\n\\n\r\n1.\\n\\n\r\nThe first real issue I had with this series is that it is advertised as a drama/comedy. However,  the comedy tends to fall flat FAR more often than not. Take for example the sub-plot about making an eroge. This sounds funny on paper and maybe it was funnier in the original novel, but it didn't get a lot of laughs from me in the anime adaptation. I'm aware that NHK was always intended to be a drama first and a comedy second, but when the likes of \"Lost in Translation\" and \"Sideways\" are SO much funnier than your comedy, why even bother having a comedy element at all? \\n\\n\r\n2.\\n\\n\r\nI applaud NHK for tackling the uncomfortable issue of hikikomori with the grace and dignity that it did, without just harshly dismissing them as losers and basement dwellers. However, I think it tried to tackle too many issues at once. Why must Sato in addition to being a hikikomori ALSO be a schizophrenic, Kaoru a Lolicon, and Misaki suffer from borderline personality disorder? Why must EVERY character in the entire series attempt suicide at least once?! Apparently the anime actually toned down the characters from the original novel in order to make them more believable and focus primarily on the hikikomori issue, instead of every mental issue known to mankind. However, if that is the case then why leave in all the mental issues?! Sato's schizophrenia and alcoholism that were very serious issues in the original novel are basically reduced to a joke in the anime! Many other anime are guilty of this crime of shoehorning in extra issues, like Elfen Lied and its random pedophilia abuse sub-plot, but even Elfen Lied didn't leave it in only to reduce it to a fucking joke! That really left a bad taste in my mouth, which is a shame because NHK can be brilliant at other moments.\\n\\n\r\n3.\\n\\n\r\nThe last major issue with NHK is pacing and struggling to adapt what worked in the novel into a TV series. During the story about the suicide cult, we spend at least 3 LONG, hard to watch episodes in which we already know that Sato and Hitomi aren't going to kill themselves halfway through a dramedy. Does the series reward us for trudging through those 1.5 hours? Does Sato have a moment of character growth and stop the suicide pact? Nope. Some random guy that we didn't see before and never see again ends up stopping it. Hitomi is then saved by her boyfriend who arrives just in the nick of time and our hero tries to kill himself because Hitomi is going to go back to her boyfriend. I understand that Sato is a protagonist with serious issues and isn't supposed to always be likeable, but rather a flawed individual struggling to overcome the obstacles in his life. However, that long and draining arc only to be rewarded with one of the most selfish and loathsome character moments was frustrating beyond belief! This was all done to show character growth and increase the drama when Sato stops yet ANOTHER character from committing suicide. However, that doesn't occur for another 13 episodes or roughly 6 fucking hours, when I was so frustrated with Sato that it wasn't as moving as it should have been. You generally can't in a TV or film adaptation spend hours and hours making the audience dislike a character and then give him a faceturn in the last second and expect everyone to instantly love him and start cheering. That's terrible pacing! NHK is a series that often seems to drag its heels and can be VERY slow and exasperating. A novel can afford to be slower, dryer, and more philosophical because the reader controls the rate of reading. If I am stressed and in a foul mood, I don't have to read 100 pages of the slower parts of the novel. If I have the flu and I reach the part in War and Peace where Natasha is trying on dresses for 10 pages, I can put the book down and read later. A show comes in 30 minute chunks and people want to watch a show in as few sittings as possible. This is a 10 hour anime that probably only needed to be 4 hours long to tell the actually relevant, important story and had 5 hours about as fun as getting your toenails torn off. If I wasn't a completionist, I would have dropped this series like a bad habit halfway through.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIf you manage to grind it out and watch the entire series, the result is pretty good. This is still THE anime that did the best job of tackling the hikikomori issue and has some powerful episodes like episode 14. I can easily see why this series has recieved the praise that it has and I would say that it DOES deserve that praise overall. However, I wish that more people would address some of the issues the series has and give more of a warning that this is NOT light, enjoyable viewing. Even if you love this series, it is a disservice to future viewers to just praise it and give no warnings about how difficult to watch it often is. I went in expecting The Producers and I got Schindler's List. Those are both good movies, but if you walk into an emotionally draining and difficult to watch film with no warning, it feels like getting punched in the face! While I would recommend this anime, I don't do so lightly. This is a series to watch if you have plenty of time and are looking for deep reflection, not a watch with friends and drink beer kind of show.\\n",

It's definitely one of the most unique and depressing anime I've watched thus far and I found myself laughing out loud every time our main protagonist, Satou, makes a fool out ofhimself but that laughter can very quickly change to depression, and at times I ask myself \"Is this suppose to be funny or depressing?\". With all the tragedy, drama and comedy this show has to offer, it's a definite roller coaster of emotions. It's not perfect (well what is?), but NHK definitely deserves a spot on my top five favorite anime of all time.\\n\\n\r\nJust in case you don't know...\\n\\n\r\nHikikomori - (literally \"pulling inward, being confined\", i.e., \"acute social withdrawal\") a Japanese term to refer to the phenomenon of reclusive adolescents or adults who withdraw from social life, often seeking extreme degrees of isolation and confinement. [Wikipedia]\\n\\n\r\nNEET - Not in Education, Employment, or Training.\\n\\n\r\nNHK - (Nippon Hoso Kyokai or Japan Broadcasting Corporation) is Japan's national public broadcasting organization. [Wikipedia]\\n\\n\r\n*STORY: 9/10\\n\r\nWhile the main plot revolves around Satou trying to get rid of his hikikomori lifestyle, most of the episodes are about Satou getting caught in series of unfortunate (but funny) events. NHK is divided into several arcs dealing with real growing social problems in the world and somehow Satou always finds himself caught up in this weird situations. From extreme online gaming addiction to getting involved in a scam, Satou will get himself in all sorts of trouble just to be saved in time by his friends Misaki and Yamazaki (sometimes). \\n\\n\r\nNHK is pretty dark and gloomy in general. The mood of the show is heavy and depressing but it also delivers effective humor for comic relief that really helps balance things out. \\n\\n\r\nRomance is only a subplot in the show but it does play a major role in the progression of the story, especially towards the ending. However, I found the romance a little disappointing because I was expecting a more conclusive ending with a solid romantic resolution. In the end I found myself staring at the screen expecting more when the credits started rolling. But even though the love between our main couple was left open-ended, it's not necessarily a total let down. There is still some satisfaction to be had on this one.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the show is slow in general (sometimes excruciatingly slow) but overall concept of the show is quite unique and well executed. \\n\\n\r\n*CHARACTERS: 9/10\\n\r\nThere are only four relevant characters in NHK and all four of them have some serious mental issues. Let start off with our not-so-normal main protagonist Tatsuhiro Satou, a 22-year-old delusional bitch living the life of a hikikomori. Satou thinks that the broadcasting station NHK is plotting a conspiracy by making people addicted anime. Best character 10/10. The second most important character and also Satou's love interest is Nakahara Misaki, a high school student who's \"helping\" Satou with his hikikomori problem by involving Satou in her \"big project\". Also there's Yamazaki Kaoru, a super-otaku and probably the sanest of the bunch. He is Satou's junior in high school and later in the anime his best friend. And lastly, we have Kashiwa Hitomi who's just background character but she plays an important role in the story, actually we wouldn't even have a story in the first place without her. Hitomi is Satou's senior and friend in high school who is also a delusional bitch. She has a deep fascination for conspiracy theories which is basically what lead to her into becoming a delusional bitch and was kind enough to involve Satou in it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters is definitely the strongest point of the NHK. We have well-rounded and easily relatable characters. They are society's misfits, not really sure what's the significance of their life but that is where character development kicks in and we start to see them grow into amazing characters although sometimes I like to strangle Satou for making the dumbest descisions.\\n\\n\r\n*ART: 7/10\\n\r\nWhile the art overall is pretty decent, there are some noticeable flaws. There are times when the characters are drawn kind of weird and slightly looking different. I don't know the reason for this, maybe they are low on budget or something, but it can really get on my nerves sometimes. And I think Satou looked a little too old for a 22-year-old. I understand that Satou isn't really living a very healthy lifestyle but I think they overdid it a little. But if you're not really that particular in anime art quality I don't think you would even care about these stuffs or even notice them so it's not really that much big of a problem. \\n\\n\r\n*SOUND: 8/10\\n\r\nI loved all the OP and ED they used in the anime. The opening theme \"Puzzle\" is a very catchy song by Round Table feat. Nino. They are amazing as always. The ending themes were also great. The first ED \"Odoru Akachan Ningen\" is rock song with an intentional out-of-tune sound that really goes well with the crazy psychological aspect of NHK and the second ED \"Modokashii Sekai no Ue De\" which is more of a sad song which I also like.\\n\\n\r\nAlso there is one particular song in this anime that I just have to mention. It's the \"Purupurupururin\" song which is sang by a fictional idol in NHK. This song is played a lot of times in the series and Satou even made it his ringtone (I'm confused why though because Yamazaki is the fan not Satou). This song is extremely annoying in the beginning but after hearing it several times I actually found it to be very catchy. I even downloaded it and made it my alarm tone, but after using it as my alarm tone for a week, it became really annoying again. Lol\\n\\n\r\n*OVERALL/ENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall, Welcome to the NHK! is highly enjoyable and as you can see, I gave this anime a perfect 10. That just proves how much I enjoyed watching this anime, but since we all have our own personal preferences there is no guarantee you'll enjoy NHK as much as I did. I don't really recommend this to kids since NHK does contain adult themes and some nudity (heck, if you're a growing boy why not?) but other than that I think everyone should give this a try. Even if you're not into psychological anime (like me) you might still enjoy this because Welcome to the NHK, while it has it's shortcomings, is a masterpiece in it's own way.",

            "content": "The anime industry is littered with shows that serve as forms of escapism, ones that whisk you away from the troubles of life, allowing you to enter a magical world free from the dread of reality. However, a few works choose to take a less conventional path, going against the grain and choosing instead to use their time to confront reality. Welcome to the NHK is one of these works, being a painful experience that is never afraid to shy away from the harsher realities of life.\r\nAt its heart, Welcome to the NHK is an exploration into the perils of life - the many painsthat each of us go through on a daily basis. Loneliness, depression, addiction, feelings of desolation and the inability to hope - all of these are things that many of us have experienced at some points in our lives. Through its wide cast of characters, Welcome to the NHK brings out the worst in us humans, often painting their pain through painfully awkward situations and depressingly dark humor. It is an excellent exploration into the downs that we can go through, and I am sure that many of us can at least relate to the show on some level.\\n\\n\r\nYet, it is not a show devoid of hope. Despite the hopelessness of the situations and the characters, it is clear that the show's message is that there is ultimately hope. Even if things might look bleak, human warmth can and will triumph, and dark times will pass. It's ultimate message is that good things will happen if you keep living, and the gift of life is something precious that cannot be thrown away easily even if times appear bad. But to do so, it is necessary to take that step forward, and be willing to work hard. That is the primary thing that you are meant to take away from the show, and I think that it is a very relatable message that will certainly touch the hearts of most. \\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, this is done well, but unfortunately, there are several flaws in the writing. There are a few little things that deter from the show, the most notable being a romance element that is introduced halfway through the series, but is sidelined and never touched upon till the end of the series. It sometimes feels like there is a lack of continuity due to the main character's inability to do something to change despite all that he has been through, but perhaps that could be chalked up as yet another exploration of the failure of human nature.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Welcome to the NHK was a very interesting experience personally. It is certainly very different from the standard shows in anime, and is an exploration of the problems that plague its very own target audience - painful and ugly problems that many would choose to hide. It is a show that chooses to confront reality instead of serving to escape from it, and is done moderately well, though there are several flaws in the writing. It is still a mostly excellent show which carries a very meaningful message and one that I absolutely adored.\\n\\n\r\nDo yourself a favor and watch this show - it is one of the few that can make you learn more about yourself  and affect your personal views of life.",

            "content": "Outstanding thing. Some times it was amusing to watch, sometimes it was painfully. \r\n    \"Welcome to the NHK\" is a kind of collection. Collection of troubles and problems we can meet in our life. It doesn't perceive as anime. It doesn't perceive as something fictitious. It is life. Hateful everyday life gets emotional colors and draws a wide reaction with slowly walking real life on the our side of screen.\r\n    In \"NHK\" everyday events are not shown grotesque and mockingly as in parodies and not weightly depressed as in psychological thrillers but somehow chaotically andtragicomicly &mdash; you want to weep, smile, think ironically and philosophize simultaneously. Every joke provokes not a roar of laughter but the sad smile as you recognize yourself and your troubles in &quot;fictional&quot; heroes.\\n\\n\r\n    Even if you have a job, relatives, interests, it doesn't change anything. You aren't able to get rid of solitude if you feel your purposelessness and pettiness. If you laugh, you laughter is insincere. If you cry, you wail. Problem of self-concept and fear of the life is urgent for many people, but the feeling of hopelessness and despair appears only when there is nobody to support you. You've got tired from struggle along on your's own not at once but gradually. It happens little by little but it does. There are no N.H.K., there is no god, there are only nonchalance, loneliness and despair. You think that people around get everything easier and live merrily and sociable but you simply can not see the same as you as they also are dissociated from the world. It is impossible to meet for such humans but only they can understand each other. It is very hard and cruel. In &quot;NHK&quot; it is shown somehow exaggeratedly but the inner life is described entirely faithful. Psychology is described as much as possible faithfully, all the reasons are named correctly, emphases are placed where they needed.\\n\\n\r\n\tArt and sound do for this work and don't have any serious shortcomings. All the aspects of this anime are high qualitative.\\n\\n\r\n\tSuch masterpiece anime must be a conspiracy... Conspiracy against what?",

            "content": "Welcome to the N.H.K. is the story of a 22-year-old hikikomori/NEET named Satou Tatsuhiro.\r\nMore than half of you are probably wondering what a hikikomori is; So that explanation should probably come now before getting into the review of the series. The dictionary definition of hikikomori is \"a state or condition of acute social withdrawal\". The number of people living the hikikomori or NEET (Not pursuing Employment, Education or Training) lifestyle are increasing everyday worldwide but they are predominantly concentrated in Japan among the adolescent male population. The hikikomori are basically shut-ins. They feel uncomfortable in presence of other people. They don\u2019t leave their rooms/houses unlessthey absolutely have to and make just enough money through various means (parents, relatives, jobs that can be done from home, and rarely part-time jobs outside the house) to survive and continue their hikikomori lifestyles.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character of the story, Satou Tatsuhiro, is a college dropout. He is a complete conspiracy nut who believes a giant organization encompassing the whole planet called the N.H.K. (Nihon Hikikomori Kyoukai / Japan Hikikomori Association/Society) is working around the clock to ruin his life and make sure he stays a shut-in forever through any means necessary. The origin of his obsession with conspiracies seems to be an upperclassman named Kashiwa Hitomi with whom he spent a lot of time with in high school. Satou realizes that he can\u2019t continue living as a NEET forever and wants to escape the lifestyle and overcome the conspiracies of the NHK but he is too afraid and doesn\u2019t know how to go about it. However, everything changes when one day he meets a girl named Nakahara Misaki who claims that she will save him from his hikikomori lifestyle if he agrees to sign a contract with her and become the subject of her \u201cproject\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a very serious subject matter but it is still full of humorous moments. The creators of the anime realize that the best way to convert such a serious subject matter into an enjoyable anime that will not only entertain the viewers but also educate them is through humor. That being said, the anime is also full serious and sometimes very sad occurrences. If you happen to be an emotional person, be prepared to shed a few tears or at least feel downright horrible watching some of the episodes of this series. The story progresses at a fair pace with a good mixture of serious episodes and some not too serious ones.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well designed and although I have never actually met a hikikomori, I would guess that the personalities and lifestyle are fairly depicted. For me, the most notable character in the series is the female lead Nakahara Misaki. She remains a mystery for almost the entire series and refuses to reveal any personal details about herself to Satou. Even when asked directly, she makes up obvious lies in order to avoid divulging anything personal. Her actions leave the viewer wondering and guessing and although that becomes somewhat annoying at times it contributes to the story coming together quite well in the end. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters \u2013 \\n\\n\r\n Satou is your \u201ctypical\u201d conspiracy nut shut-in (or what you would imagine one would act and feel like). While his hikikomori lifestyle doesn\u2019t seem to be as severe as some other people\u2019s, it is bad enough to keep him from functioning as a part of society and most of his ventures to the outside world seem to end with him becoming completely scared and freaked out.\\n\\n\r\n Satou\u2019s only male friend Yamazaki Kaoru is your typical anime/hentai/game otaku. He is obsessed with all sorts of things the most notable of which happens to be echii games. He is very passionate about his obsessions and becomes easily enraged by the smallest things especially if they have any relevance to his obsessions. Needless to say, he is an amusing character to watch.\\n\\n\r\n Satou\u2019s upperclassman (senpai) Kashiwa Hitomi is a complete conspiracy nut like Satou. She seems depressed most of the time and even sees being happy as a sign that she is playing into the conspiracies. She is a supporting character in the series, but plays an important role in the development of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is nothing spectacular but the voices fit the characters well. The same can be said about the music. There is no ground-breaking piece of music in the series. There is however a somewhat catchy anime song that is played throughout pretty much the entire series. Do be careful not to get it stuck in your head.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animations are at best average. You won\u2019t find any great-looking characters and the animation can be sort of clumsy at times. I can best compare the art to \u2018Great Teacher Onizuka\u2019. However, it looks slightly better and animations are done at a higher quality. That being said, the art style does fit the series quite well. I can\u2019t imagine the story represented with any different kind of art style.\\n\\n\r\nATTENTION: The next paragraph talks about the ending. While I will not include any specifics about what happens at the end of the series, I will talk about the style and quality of the ending. If you feel this might spoil things for you, skip over the next paragraph.\\n\\n\r\nThe story ends. That sounds like a weird statement, but most of you know that in many Anime series that doesn\u2019t happen and it\u2019s always a letdown when this occurs. So rejoice; this one actually concludes. It is the ending you will likely suspect part of the way through watching the series with a few twists and turns before it gets there.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Welcome to the NHK is a well-written and well-told story about a serious subject matter. It has a good pace and just enough of both humor and sadness. I enjoyed the series very much and if it is a type of anime you normally enjoy, I am sure you will love this series as well.\\n",

            "content": "Are you new to anime? Or are you a veteran? Well, with \"NHK ni Youkoso!\" it doesn't matter! This is one of those anime that you can easily get through, want more, think about it's message and wonder how such a masterpiece isn't more popular. Not only does this anime entertain it's audience with a wonderful story, a variety of characters, great sound affects and great music, but it also teaches the viewer about the difficulties of social anxiety and psychological disorders. There are only a handful of anime out there that handle such delicate subjects and shower them inbrilliant dark comedy. Anyway, before getting too worked up in my intro, let me start my review. \\n\\n\r\nStory (10/10)\\n\\n\r\n     Unique, complex, entertaining, slow paced and utterly brilliant. The story of this anime is so beautifully constructed, executed and structured that it took me a while before realizing how amazing it really was. The synopsis is already provided so I won't be summarizing anything here. In fact, I'd recommend reading the synopsis before continuing to read the rest of this review. The story telling in this anime is such a roller coaster of emotions that it's honestly pretty exhausting sometimes. Most scenes had me in the brink of tears from either laughing too hard or watching something painfully realistic and relatable. It starts off with a lot more comedy in the beginning, but the further you go, the more bittersweet moments you find. The romance is also pretty realistic in the sense that you'll NEVER see the main couple be LOVEY DOVEY. I think some people might dislike this anime a lot because it doesn't necessarily rely on the suspension of disbelief like other anime. True, there are a lot of weird/funny hallucinations the main character sees and hears, but almost all of the situations throughout the anime are believable. Anyway, this isn't the only anime to tackle on the whole \"society is a bitch\" idea, but it's one of the few to actually do it in such an efficient, painful, smart, and entertaining way. Honestly, I could go on and on about the story, but I think you guys get my point by now. \\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\\n\r\n     Before judging the artwork of this anime, keep in mind that it was released in 2006, almost a whole decade ago. Although it's not the prettiest artwork or the most innovative, but I do think the artwork fits the genre and story perfectly well. With that being said, there'll definitely be moments when you'll be thinking \"wow this anime is a lot more beautiful than I thought\". Just like the themes, the artwork has this extremely grungy, old school, somber feel to it. It also reminds me a lot of Cowboy Bebop for some reason. Which obviously makes this anime that much more awesome. All kidding aside though, there is also a good variety of artwork throughout the anime. You'll notice a difference of quality in scenes depending on the setting. Scenes where Tatsuhiro is at the beach, the park, or in the city are a lot more visually pleasing than when he's at home. Facial expressions on every character are also unique and interesting. Overall, the artwork perfectly suits the anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\\n\r\n     The opening and ending songs of this anime are really good. Not my personal favorites, but easily in my top 20. That aside, the quality of the voice acting in this anime is ridiculously high. Each voice actor feels like they're perfectly suited for their role. The sound effects during hallucinations are great and most of the time extremely hilarious. My personal favorite by far is our main character, but that's only because he gets the most screen time(duh). Music during scenes are perfectly intertwined with the situations in the anime. With music you sometimes forget it's there. However, if you've watched anime for a while you can't help, but notice what a big role it plays in most scenes. There's a wide range of music that vary from playful to extremely sad and depressing. It's pretty stunning. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\\n\r\n     This is probably the strongest aspect of this anime. Each character has a purpose. Every character grows, fails, learns, and maximizes their potential as a solid character. There is no such thing as a \"weak character\" in this anime. It's actually unbelievable how well written, well developed and well exposed every character is and how that justifies their existence. Not a single character feels extraneous or even annoying. It almost feels like every character has tragic hero qualities. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) \\n\\n\r\nI LOOOOVVVVVVVVEEEEEE THIS ANIME!!!! It's definitely on the same level as Toradora, Lovely Complex, Kimi ni Todoke, Clannad/Clannad: After story, Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai, etc.  It's worth watching, re-watching, purchasing, and remembering. It was painful to watch, it was hilarious, it was bittersweet and underrated. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nNotes: I did write this review a few weeks after watching it, but my feelings and perspectives towards it have not changed. I loved it and would recommend it to anyone looking for something unique and highly interesting. I'm not going to lie, you have to be a little mature to get some references and relate to it fully.",

            "content": "First, let me say that I saw this entire show in a period of 3 days. So, that in itself says something about how enjoyable it was. If I wasn't having a good time watching it, then I wouldn't have bothered doing 12 episodes in one day. :)\r\nThe story is pretty well done. It basically traverses through Satou's rough life as a hikikomori and his various means to combat it. There are a few episodes that I had issues with, as they were quite \"okay...this is really cheesy\". But, overall, the episodes went well with the life of someone who is afraid to go outsideor be in large crowds.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation is top notch. Absolutely no qualms with anything in this department.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was probably the best part about this show. Great opening and decent ending. The background music and \"main theme\" were awesome too. I'm pretty sure I'll end up grabbing the soundtrack for this series. Very catchy tunes.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters...were well explained I think. There were a lot of gaps in my opinion though as quite a few things are left out in the open throughout the show. We don't learn much of anything in detail about the cast either. We learn plenty about Satou and such, but I think they could have done better with \"reasons\" and stuff like that.\\n\\n\r\n2nd thing I loved about this show was the comedy. Freakin' hilarious scenes everywhere. Satou and Yamakazi are great together and will have you rolling on the floor laughing countless times. The jokes are original and none of that lame crap that \"younger audience\" anime titles might throw at you. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, very good series. The ending was well done too (though it left me wanting a bit). Pick this up, you'll have fun with it.",

            "content": "I was expecting a dark Satoshi Kon style satire on hikikomorism; the dehabilitating affects of media as represented by the NHK broadcasting company and post millennium conspiracy theories, but instead this anime merely uses hikkomorism as a backdrop for melodramatic relationship angst and blues.\r\nThere's no satire, no NHK broadcasting company, and no conspiracy.  Why this show is even titled the way it is, I don\u2019t know.  The main character only mentions the NHK a handful of times and only in passing, there's no actual focus on the broadcasting company itself.  The name is just an abbreviation of the main character's conspiracy theoryspouted here and there.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no deep exploration of hikkomorism, as this anime would fool people into believing it does; the condition is just the Big Quirk (tm) of the character, who suffers more from being a NEET than hikikomori.  In fact he spends more time outside than inside his room during the 24 episodes.  Shame on the writer also for having the recovery process kick-started by a cute girl coming out of nowhere and helping the loser protagonist no matter how pathetic he is.  Anime screenwriting is just masturbation.\\n\\n\r\nOther drawbacks of this show are innumerable amount of contrived coincidences, and plot lines wrapped up so quickly and neatly they might as well have CGI'd a freakin' bow onto them.  The main character is written like such an oaf, he is by far the dumbest person on the planet, and probably one of the dumbest in the history of anime too.  And it's purely for comedy; but it\u2019s not funny at all, just tiresome to watch his stupidity move him from one plot point to another.\\n\\n\r\nI gave this show a personal non-review score of 8 which means it entertained me, and ultimately it does avoid climaxing into a generic cliche; having the grace to show how life is just too great for some of us to handle in the end.  So contrary to what I've written so far this isn\u2019t a 'bad' anime at all.  It just falls short in so many ways and could have been something different.\\n\\n\r\nThis story could have been special; it could have been an actual compelling look at a real illness plaguing Japan and could have made the protagonist beat it without the help of a girl, and then this anime could have been an encouragement to actual hikikomoris watching it.  I don\u2019t know how well the anime followed the source novel, but regardless the writing is at fault, which is ironic considering the main protagonist is also a lousy writer.  We can expect too much from anime sometimes, and must be sadly reminded that there are only a handful of writers, directors, and producers in the industry who don\u2019t follow convention and trends, and stand firm to deliver creative and challenging work.\\n\\n\r\nAs unique a backdrop as this anime has, it is neither creative or challenging.",

            "content": "Welcome to the world of mental disorders, in which everything looks colorful yet mundane. It is a world that lets affected people transcend the borders of the ordinary by allowing them to impose their very own interpretation of the world upon the circumstances that surround them. This way, people learn to cope with their sometimes unpromising situations by making use of their powerful minds alone.\r\nThose who have a profound knowledge on the functioning of the human psyche including the process of dissonance reduction probably understand the importance of the NHK to exist. Ultimately, that what constitutes the NHK and other conspiracies (in the case ofSatou and Kashiwa) as well as god (in the case of Misaki) is nothing else than the need to externalize the guilt people feel when confronted with their misery, and to consequently appease their minds in order to keep going.\\n\\n\r\nBasically this is one possible interpretation of the message that NHK ni Youkoso! tries to convey. Despite its comedic appearance, this show deals with one of the most significant topics on social behavior in Japan that even consistently gains in popularity among western societies, and delivers nothing else than mind-blowingly deep engagement with the psyche of four very different characters and the extent of their mutual influence on an emotional and cognitive level.\\n\\n\r\nNHK ni Youkoso! is the only anime I know that manages to get a good grasp of how it is really like to suffer solitude and the inability to escape this mental condition by the means of one's own actions. However dramatic this subject may be, it is the more fascinating how entertaining and easy the method is that NHK ni Youkoso! uses to not let the viewer fall into despair himself, but to rather encourage him to reflect on his own lifestyle by simultaneously enjoying the sometimes hilarious happenings in the lives of the main characters. This series tries to demonstrate that there is always a way out of social isolation and self-pity, and that it is not rocket science to develop one's very own coping strategies.\\n\\n\r\nBut, as many other great series, NHK ni Youkoso! is not perfect, not even in storytelling, which shows especially in rough transitions between various minor arcs trying to thematize very different issues socially inept people have to deal with. This leads to a somewhat staccato-styled storytelling, with its story broken up into several pieces and being not fluent enough to be considered a realistic tale. A very inconsistent implementation of romantic elements adds to this and makes me question the characters' attitudes. As a result, the story feels very different before and after episode 9. A sudden change in atmosphere is something that, in fact, often works for anime like these, given the sheer unpredictability in the behavior of mentally unstable characters. In NHK ni Youkoso!, however, this led to my disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why I couldn't rate this show as high as the story would have deserved it lies within the technical dimension. Although the soundtrack is distinct and fits very well to the not-so-much-desperate, but rather ironically enjoyable atmosphere that underlies the show, the visual arts, especially the key animations, were done really sloppily. If you have watched Ping Pong The Animation, you know that there are obvious ways of selling sloppy arts as a kind of new style. This doesn't work out for NHK ni Youkoso! however, since the drawings are inconsistent in general. Characters are drawn very sharp and detailed at one time only to be dissolving in the background at another. This is something I regard as bad quality, unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, NHK ni Youkoso! is a fascinating work that is not only interesting to those who suffer the same fate as any character in this show, but also to people who are just interested in the functioning of the human psyche. This series depicts the strangely easy way people cope with their mental and personality disorders in an immensely entertaining, sometimes absolutely hilarious, but also emotionally involving manner. It makes you reflect on your lifestyle and potentially delivers answers to questions you didn't know you've had before.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 8.33/10\\n\r\n(A quantified evaluation can be found on my page.)\\n",

            "content": "There exists something rare in this medium. In fact, its so rare, that only a handful of titles have managed to do this and still make the anime work. This trait is called realistic chemistry of characters. In a fictional work, it's virtually impossible to create relations so genuine, that it is almost frightening to experience when you do so. You are aware that what you're witnessing is made-up, but can't help comparing the characters' life to yours, as well as the struggles they encounter.\r\nThis is where Welcome to the NHK shines, and they don't hold back in making you feel like you are partof the story; while being unable to help those who are suffering. It's a terrible feeling, and if you're weak-hearted, I do not suggest you to watch this show: it's simply too powerful.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of NHK is rather straight-forward: a guy lives in his room, away from society, and we get to see how he deals with new-found dilemmas; or, that's what they expect us to believe. In fact, it's nothing about that at all. The story develops into being much more about world conspiracies, proving how fake the world is, as well as the human condition when dealing with  rejection and denial. We are brought into this world where everything seems to be against our protagonists, including their own families.\\n\r\nYou can comprehend the story in two ways:\\n\r\n1. Mostly Comedic\\n\r\n2. Mostly Depressing\\n\\n\r\n1. Many people believe that the humor that NHK holds is the bread-and-butter of the show, and thus cannot be taken too seriously. Like this, when the show is seen to be getting more serious, they treat this change of heart as dramatization. The problem with this way of thinking, is that it highly undermines the show itself. NHK has many comedic moments, which may or may not be understood as dark-comedy, or simply comic-relief. These people tend to state NHK as being over-dramatic and thus overrated.\\n\\n\r\n2. The other group of people, including myself, see the basis of comedy as  a minor genre of the show. However, this group sees the comedy as being dark, so it adds to the depressing overtone, instead of taking it away. Like this, I do not believe that NHK is dramatized at all, instead it's flavor being added. People more accustomed to anime are more likely to belong in this group, thus the show is recommendable to both newcomers as well as veterans of the anime community.\\n\\n\r\nGetting that out of the way, as stated in the introduction, NHK places emphasis on world-conspiracies. They structured this very well, combining the male protagonists backstory with this train of thought. It deals with human psychology in ways very unique to anime, without including paragraphs of monologue which can be very irritating if done wrong or in excess. Everything betrays Satou, which is very depressing to watch. It's like watching a train that is heading towards a person, you know what's going to happen, and you feel powerless against it. While watching the show this feeling was so mutual, that I had to take breaks just to ease the pain.\\n\r\nThe story is not perfect however. While being very realistic and innovative ,the ending was bittersweet. And not the kind of bittersweet of which you can walk away and say \"Well, at least it was satisfying\". They could have explored further into the relations of the characters, but what we got as what we got: a cliffhanger.\\n\r\n There were also many arcs in the story which felt very out-of-place and were slightly unnecessary in my opinion. In addition to this, the pacing was questionable at times, there were moments were I felt it was going too slow and fast respectively. But for the most time, the pacing was on-point.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nA series cannot be made depressing without a great cast of likable characters. The way this works, is that the more likable a character is, the more painful it becomes when you watch them meet an obstacle.  As stated at the introduction, the chemistry of the characters was so well done that I felt like I was eating a steak made of ice (bad jokes are bad). But seriously though, I couldn't believe my eyes; it was as if I was witnessing the lives of real humans, where every struggle and dilemma have a reasonable impact to the characters, as well as the audience. You felt so condensed with the characters that it was like you knew them for many years. So as a result you really don't want to see them get hurt.\\n\r\nI will now evaluate the characters individually:\\n\\n\r\n1. Satou\\n\\n\r\nHe's your main male lead, and straight from the bat he's likable and highly relatable. He's the story's main focus, and we watch him deal with his everyday struggles as a hikikomori. ***SPOILERS***We witness him being rejected by him parents, almost commit suicide, become addicted to visual novels and RPG's, and living alone without any friends, suffering from day to day.***END OF SPOILER*** It's as if the viewer is Sato himself and you are experiencing his life through his eyes. How did they do this, you ask? I have no idea, but he is one of the best written characters I have ever witnessed.\\n\\n\r\n2.Misaki\\n\\n\r\nShe is the main female lead who, at the start, seems to be your everyday one-dimensional character. It's only until later in the story where we find out her backstory and thus we are able to dive deep into the psychology of her characterization. This is purposely done so that the emphasis is given to Satou instead, thus we can empathize with him first. The same technique was used with Misaki as her backstory was uncovering, and her presence became more necessary. Without including any spoilers, she makes the anime that much more depressing than it already was.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, when I stated the chemistry being golden, it's between these two characters and the romance that follows. It's not your typical love-interest. The characters develop thoroughly throughout the length of the show, and this is done through struggles and leaps. *MINOR SPOILERS*Misaki tries to help Satou into getting out of the zone he finds himself to be in, while returning him back to society as an everyday functional human being.*END OF SPOILERS* Their meeting was purely coincidental, but the anime portrays this coincidence as fate, rather than chance.  \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are few and far between, but most of them play a large role in the story. I will not talk about these characters individually, because they introduce themselves later in the story, but what I can tell you is that, for the most part, they are not trouped. They have they own struggles and developments, and do not exist as a means of comic relief, for the most part.\\n\r\nHowever, there are a few side characters that are more useless than not, and can be quite irritating to watch. A key example is Kobayashi Megumi who was not pleasurable to listen to and had no real purpose for existing.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: 5\\n\\n\r\nSadly this is were NHK falls, and boy does it fall. For the most part, NHK's art is on-par with the anime at the time, and was relatively fluid, although lacking detail. BUT, there were episodes were the quality decreases so much ,its ridiculous. We have no detail here, literally stick-men. Gladly these episodes were a minority; but the consistency is inexcusable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nTHOSE TRUMPETS. THOSE GLORIOUS TRUMPETS. The opening of NHK was wonderful and highly nostalgic. It fits the tone of the anime second to none, and I am glad they did not change it (although the trumpets were removed for some odd reason). The first ending song was unique and intelligent, showing off the dark humor, as well as the psychological aspect of the show very well. The second ending was fantastic, as it was sang by the same artist who performed the opening, and thus had a similar vibe to it.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was excellent: exactly what you would expect when watching an anime in Japanese, but I cannot say the same for the English dub, since I have not watched it.\\n\r\nThe OST sadly did not stand out to me as much as everything else. There were a few songs that were fantastic, but these were played too many times throughout the length of the show, which is a shame, because you tend to notice these things when watching NHK.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nI loved this show, but because it was so depressing to watch, I did not want to see what would happen next due to the pain of experiencing something so genuinely saddening. The huge lack of budget in terms of animation/art as well as overused OST's decreased the value of enjoyment as well, but these are nitpicks. The ending was not complete to my liking, but was still a fantastic closure nevertheless.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nA fantastic show that is highly nostalgic. I would only recommend this to those who can handle watching 'tragedies'. If by ANY MEANS you have a weak heart when watching depressing shows, PLEASE skip this one, unless you're watching just for comedic purposes. Otherwise, simply enjoy the brilliance that is NHK, which in my opinion, is one of the best non-monologue-inducing psychological titles anime has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading my review!

            "content": "Every now and then you come across those shows that just strike you with a sort of emotional response you rarely get elsewhere. It's not a directly tragic response, it's more a gentle, melancholy feeling - a poignant way of portraying reality for what it is - not a happy optimistic place, not a place where you're guaranteed a bright future, but a harsh place that some people find so hard to deal with they shut themselves away from it instead.\r\nThe main character of NHK!, Satou Tatsuhiro, is one such person. What the Japanese call a hikikomori (from wikipedia: \"h. is a Japanese term torefer to the phenomenon of reclusive adolescents or young adults who withdraw from social life, often seeking extreme degrees of isolation and confinement.\"). He dropped out from college, has no job, and he spends his days locked up in his apartment living off his parents' allowance, only going out at night to buy food and goods from a local convenience store. On top of this, he has a firm belief that everything is a conspiracy, right down to why he is a hikikomori (he believes that an organization known as the Japan Hikikomori Organziation, or the Nihon Hikikomori Kyokai (the titular NHK) exists and has the one and only goal to produce more hikikomori).\\n\\n\r\nThen one day he meets a girl, who happens to know quite a lot about him. A variety of circumstances eventually leads to him being a part of a 'project' this girl has devised; one aimed at curing the hikikomori condition. Now, the \"troubled boy meets girl and everything slowly improves, interspersed with some drama\" story line isn't exactly what you would associate with something good or brilliant right off the bat, but the means by which NHK! handles it is anything but mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nChiefly, for me, this reason lay in its thematics, the way it handled the various issues it crosses. While it mainly deals with the issues of a shut-in lifestyle, it touches upon many other issues: Dealing with an unfulfilling life, ambitions that never came true, how to face life and its ramifications, wanting to end one's life - and many more in that line, all of which can be cooked down to one simple thing: Reality kind of sucks. It's a harsh, often unforgiving place where you don't get anything on a silver platter. Happiness and success are both goals that lie far away, in high-reaching places, and it's hard to get there. NHK! manages to portray this poignant realization of reality with evocative storytelling and brilliant charaters.\\n\\n\r\nDealing with such heavy themes, of course, can become quite a lot if that is the sole focus of the series. Thankfully its makers had the sense and wits to insert comedic relief, and at very appropriate moments, even. It manages to retain a slightly light-hearted tone without ruining the concept or derivating from the thematics, and that is a very big accomplishment in and of itself. Not only that, but the comedy is consistently of high quality. There's no reliance on stupid fan service, moe antics or predictable escapades from stupid characters who's only there to serve as comedic relief.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, every character you see in NHK! has a very well-placed purpose within the plot, they are of high quality and are enjoyable to watch. Satou is a well-balanced character; he's a college dropout and a hikikomori, but he is not a stupid idiot who hangs around for comedic relief nor is he shallow. The scenes where he reflects on his time in high school with his senpai, Hitomi Kashiwa (who also believes everything is a conspiracy), are very nostalgic in their nature and points to a character who knows that his life is askew, who knows that he's on a bad road, who wants to turn, but it's hard. Life is unforgiving and once you're off track it is not easy to get back.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast are just as good as characters; the good-hearted yet mysterious Misaki who wants to help Satou recover from his hikikomori ways, his galge-obsessed neighbor Yamazaki, his old high school senpai who's obsessed with conspiracies, and then some - all of them play a very important part in Satou's story, but never once are you left with the feeling that they are not good characters in their own right. Watching them go through the miseries of their existences, reacting to and developing from all that; it is very, very evocative.\\n\\n\r\nEvery one of these characters has a grim story to tell, something that bogs them down and makes their lives hard. But never, even once, do their troubles, their drama, feel forced or unnatural. It is all extremely poignant, it feels right and it is handled very skillfully, as we progress through themes such as abuse, family troubles, reality escape, failed ambitions, obsessive thoughts, depression, self-loathing, loneliness and even suicide; all handled with immaculate care and presented quite brilliantly. \\n\\n\r\nThe series' soundtrack is absolutely impeccable; it does the job that a soundtrack is supposed to do perfectly; bringing life to the emotions of the series. The melancholy, the loneliness, the fun and comedy; NHK! has the right songs for the right places, and also features a drove of insert songs, something rarely seen in anime - and generally very effectual, as is indeed the case with this series. I also greatly enjoyed the series' opening and ending themes; Modokashii Sekai no Ue de by Yui Makino has written itself onto my absolute top list of anime themes.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality is overall solid but it does not quite live up to the standard of the rest of the series. It does have a rich colour palette and its background work is generally solid, but at times the character designs feel rather askew which does detract a little bit.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all though, this is the best show I have watched in a very, very long time. The quality of its story, characters and its thematics was fantastic, and the lasting sensation of melancholy the series brought forth in me is something I have not experienced in other fiction to date. Well done!",

            "content": "NHK ni Youkoso is an anime based off a novel and manga of the same name by Tatsuhiko Takimoto. It is a story about a hikikomori and NEET (Not currently engaged in Employment, Education or Training) named Tatsuhiro Sat&#333; who struggles with who he is and just getting through daily life.\rStory: The main plot is about Sato receiving special training from a girl named Misaki Nakahara on how to break free from his hikikomori ways. Overall there is quite a depressing tone and it convey's realistic internal conflicts and struggles that the characters face. From start to finish it never seemed to stray from itspurpose, which was among other things, to paint a picture of the hikikomori lifestyle.\\n\\n\rAnimation: Although the animation is generally good, there are a few cases during the series (entire episodes) where the quality of animation really goes down. Other then that it is good and consistent.\\n\\n\rSound: I very much like the music, the opening and endings are very enjoyable and background music is very fitting and keeps up with the overall depressing tone of the series. None of the voice acting really stands out, it is well done and the voices match the characters rather nicely.\\n\\n\rCharacter: The characters all seem very realistic. They all have problems that they have to deal with and many of them are not above selfish desires. Many of the characters take advantage of Sato's trusting, even naive nature, which often leaves Sato in predicaments. I believe that keeping the characters in this anime realistic is important for it to deliver its message, and it does so very well.\\n\\n\rEnjoyment: I enjoyed watching this anime from start to finish, it is quite unique and it was interesting to see if and how Sato could overcome the problems he faced. Fans of the drama and slice of life genre's should really check this out I think, although there is some comedy it isn't a primary genre.",

            "content": "Welcome to the NHK is a Seinen, Psychological, Comedy, Drama about a guy who has become a hikikomori (someone who has shut themselves away from society) and is living his life believing in conspiracies. Then his life is suddenly turned around when some girl decides to cure him of his hikikomori ways.\r\nThis series starts of confusingly enough and it seems to flows at a very slow pace as it introduces the main characters and the overall plot of the series. However from the start it is pretty difficult to understand exactly what this is all about, because it doesn't do things in a way mostanime series does. It's only until a couple episodes into the show that you can truly understand the nature of this anime and that is of the various psychological and social issues each character is faced with. What makes it so interesting are the different psychological disorders that are shown and the way they are realistically expressed by the characters like Tatsuhiro Satou being a &quot;hikikomori&quot; and Misaki who's trying cure him but she is obviously messed up in the head as well. With all the serious issues in this anime, it's quite refreshing to see all the hilarious antics they get into, whilst still retaining a sense of realism.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for this anime suits it perfectly with a great deal of detail put into the backgrounds and environment. Although the characters do appear to look a bit off quite frequently but this can easily be over looked due to the nature of this show. The music also helps a lot, with plenty of weird melodies to go with the baffling moments and the catchy opening themes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Welcome to the NHK is really an anime of its own, with nothing to compare it against. This anime is able to realistically show many different problems that the Japanese society is facing with and in the process make you laugh whilst keeping you intrigued throughout. Yet due to the unfamiliarity of this anime, not all anime fans will be able to get into it. So if you want to find out what it means to be a hikikomori, then check this out.\\n\r\n^_^",

It's got a truly great mix of laughs, cringes, tears, light romance, stress, and all manner of feels. The series ultimately sums up all of the ways a modern man could be truly pathetic, and presents it in a way that makes us all contemplate, laugh at, and root for ourselves.\r\nThe series follows Satou Tatsuhiro, an active shut-in of four years, a raging narcissist (despite knowing how pathetic he truly is), and a borderline schizophrenic conspiracy theorist. It shows Satou'sdaily struggle to maintain his status as a NEET, while the world around him keeps trying to pull him outside.\\n\\n\r\nNHK moves in several chronological story loops, which each span 3 or 4 episodes. Some are purely comedic, some comment strongly on social issues, some are dark and depressed (although still very funny in their own terrible way.) The story progresses as Satou places himself into situation after situation that depict very real issues today, but are also just the most outrageously frustrating places to be. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, I went into the series blind, and it smashed its way directly into my top 5, with perhaps my favorite anime protagonist ever. I've shown it to tons of friends, who all fall instantly in love with it. If you're on the fence... Dive right in!",

            "content": "I have long heard that &ldquo;Welcome to the NHK!&rdquo; (which I will call WttNHK for short) is a fairly good anime with strong comedic elements. This is an understatement. What lies beneath the superficial surface that WttNHK posits itself to enclose are a myriad of thematics pertaining to human interaction, societal repression, and the core motivations behind human behaviour. Let us explore:\r\nStory- WttNHK is about a young man (Tatsuhiro Sato) who quit going to college after he believed he was being bullied by his peers. He thus shuts himself in his cramped apartment for about four years, going outside only at night to shop forcheap convenience store food. He lives off an allowance provided by his mother and father, who are largely unaware of his current lifestyle. Sato&rsquo;s stagnant lifestyle takes a dramatic turn when he meets the young Misaki Nakahara, who makes it her mission to relieve Sato of his status as a &ldquo;hikikomori&rdquo; by making him sign a somewhat juvenile contract stating that he must meet with her for counseling every night, or pay a fine of one million yen. The plot also involves other characters including Sato&rsquo;s neighbour, Kaoru Yamazaki, his old sempai from high school, Hitomi Kashiwa, and his old class president/representative, Megumi Kobayashi. These characters all interact in what would typically be seen as nothing more then comedic melodrama. This, however, is only half the story. WttNHK goes far beyond the average slice of life anime to bring us what is perhaps one of the most realistic, touching, and dark plotlines one can hope to find in an anime. \\n\r\nSome of the more prominent themes and ideas that are divulged include the notion of societal repression in a modern society and core emotive motivations behind human conduct. Sato&rsquo;s state of being a hikokomori, which he generally acquiesces, is explored in great detail during the show. By doing this, a great deal of direct allusions to Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, and other psychologists are made by Misaki herself as she hopes to discover the origin of Sato&rsquo;s hikikomori state of mind and potential solutions of how to &ldquo;cure&rdquo; it by assimilating him back into the workings of modern society. WttNHK thus generally implies that the typical modern lifestyle is a positive one and that humans should generally live their lives in accordance with the status quo. However, it paradoxically claims that such of lifestyle is a negative one through the very fact that some of the shows more intelligent and congenial characters reject the status quo by either becoming a hikikomori (Sato),  planning to commit suicide (Hitomi), or using computers games or doujin eroge as a means of escapism (Yamazaki). This debatable paradox is what makes the show quite alluring to most viewers, whether is occurs on a subconscious or largely conscious level. The state of mind is also examined in considerable detail as well- mostly through the lens of psychology. For example, the fact that Sato constantly misinterprets the actions of those around him and hostile or even tyrannical suggests he is repressing traumatic experiences from the past and quite obviously possesses an inferiority complex. I could go on, but must stop myself for fear of digression. \\n\r\nThe other dominant aspect of WttNHK is motivations behind human behaviour. In most cases, this is examined through the characters&rsquo; love lives, but also seen through why certain characters would choose to take part in largely illegal or thanatic activities. The latter can be seen in the characters of Megumi and Hitomi respectively.  Megumi enters an illegal pyramid marketing scheme because she claims to have to provide for her hikikomori brother, when it is revealed that she really just felt a need to secure her place within the economy by possessing a stable job. Hitomi wants, and attempts to, commit suicide because she feels neglected by her fianc&eacute; and thus comes to the (irrational) conclusion that she would rather cease living rather than live in a world where she is afraid of being indirectly by her beloved. It is through these examples and the ones that I will present in the next few sentences that I would suggest WttNHK presents a somewhat bleak and austere interpretation of human incentives, since all the characters&rsquo; actions essentially stem from personal selfishness. Characters&rsquo; love lives are revealed to be quite dysfunctional in this sense as well.  While Misaki ends up genuinely having feelings and loving Sato in the end, it is revealed that she wanted to help him in the first place because he was the only person in the world that she believed was more miserable and unsuccessful than herself (which she directly states numerous times in the show). Yamazaki&rsquo;s potential love life with a girl from his college is destroyed after he becomes overly suspicious of her intentions and comes to the irrational conclusion that she actually loves another man. This stems from the fact that since a girl cheated on him in the past, he believes it will undoubtedly happen again in the present. He is thus guilty of committing the fallacy &ldquo;post hoc ergo propter hoc&rdquo; (false cause). This is relevant to many of the situations that may arise in one&rsquo;s life, especially as the mature and form meaningful bonds with others. Since the many viewers can identify with the characters and their motivations in the anime, they feel sympathy (pathos) for the characters and become all the more engaged with WttNHK&rsquo;s story.\\n\r\nThe plot does have a few weak points (which I won&rsquo;t point out since many of you probably are tired of reading this and don&rsquo;t care at this point), but they are largely overshadowed by the anime&rsquo;s strong, pertinent themes, meriting my rating of the story to be a 9.\\n\r\nIn the end, I hope I have at least convinced you that WttNHK does have legitimate depth, even though you may not agree with some of my conclusions. I encourage those interested in looking more into the plot of WttNHK to read some of the other reviews on this website- many of them are quite juicy. \\n\\n\r\nBecause most of my energy was expended by discussing the plot, and I am sure most of you are tired of my ramblings, my comments on the art, sound, character, and enjoyment of the series will be relatively short, but long enough that it will hopefully give you a good idea of what the WttNHK holds in store for you prospective viewers under these categories. \\n\\n\r\nArt- WttNHK was fairly strong for the most part, as it realistically portrays average Japanese citizens without hyper-sexualizing or drawing attention to the characters in ways that most anime tend to (e.g. giving characters odd hair colours). The animation is smooth for the most part and the bright colours used in the foregrounds and backgrounds of many scenes do function as an effective allure for viewers in most circumstances. However, one will not find much, if any, truly exceptional artwork or animation here.\\n\\n\r\nSound- WttNHK&rsquo;s background music was consistent and did not become tiresome  by the time I completed the series. There was one background song featuring an acoustic guitar that I particularly enjoyed, as it helped to enhance and give life to many of the anime&rsquo;s more depressing scenes. Opening and ending songs were mediocre at best (although the ending theme &ldquo;Odoru Akachan Ningen&rdquo; did have some pretty good lyrics) and all sound effects seemed to be in place*.    \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- WttNHK does an excellent job of resisting conforming to the cookie-cutter stereotypes that many anime seem to recycle time and time again. There are no clearly distinguishable tsunderes, Naruto-types, little-sister types, or ENFs (embarrassed nude females) here, unless they are being used specifically for hyperbolic or comedic effect (such as the hilarious Purin-chan, with her mighty theme song). This keeps all the characters fresh, interesting and likable as they interact with one another in a natural, realistic way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- I cannot remember one episode where I found myself checking the time remaining before the episode was over while it was playing. If you do not understand what I mean by this, it means I really enjoyed watching this wonderful anime and was completely drawn in by its comedic, yet serious, and intelligent plot. It was definitely a pleasure to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- In the end, WttNHK is a great anime that perfectly combines strong comedy with more serious themes pertaining to human behaviour and the effects of a modern society on the individual. WttNHK effectively comments on these ideas without impeding its core emotive storyline in the least. I recommend that whether you are into comedy, drama, and/or psychological anime, you should definitely give &ldquo;Welcome To The NHK!&rdquo; a watch.\\n\\n\r\n*In all honesty, does anyone really actively listen for sound effects during anime? From what I can remember, one of the only anime that had exceptional sound effects was &ldquo;Ghost Hound&rdquo;.\\n",

            "content": "Here it is, people. This is no hyperbole. NHK is the worst anime of all time. It is one of the worst pieces of media you can conjure. A reality show about the Kardashians must be better than this. Pathetic YouTube parodies are better than this. In order to make something worse than this, you\u2019ll need to let Ian Watkins brag about his pedophilia in the Lostprophets album that was never made.\r\nThere is no correlation between artistic quality and morality, as Lostprophets have displayed. Yet, you have to wonder what kind of awful person would subject the world to this. Worse, what kind of personwould make an anime whose purpose is to make fun of anime watchers? Imagine if your ordinary school bully made an anime. There is so much wrong that I want to rant about it, shoot up heroin and watch Texhnolyze. That one was also bad, but it looks like a better version of Digimon Tamers over this, and Digimon Tamers is already brilliant.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not sure where to start with this mess, so let\u2019s get with the art style. Art style is important. If not, you wouldn\u2019t use a visual medium. Why, then, are the artists so unimaginative? Something makes me worry it\u2019s on purpose, like those East Coast rappers who are so afraid of sounding \u2018not real\u2019 their beats barely have a drum. Everyone in this series is black haired and has no distinct facial features.\\n\\n\r\nThis may sound realistic, only it isn\u2019t. People in real life actually look distinct. Even if you eschew wacky hairdos, your characters must not look like they came out of the assembly line. There are no odd touches to the hairstyle, different body structures, or an arrangement of facial features that stick out. In fact, the artists are so unimaginative that they can\u2019t come up with a basic sexy design. Our main characters work on an eroge, and the design they come up with can barely touch the most obscure visual novels. Even when they could use anything in the artist\u2019s arsenal \u2013 twintails split into 4, floating hair, purple lips \u2013 they still end up with a dull design. It\u2019s worse than visual novels that have \u2018same face, different hair syndrome\u2019 because at least Da Capo\u2019s girls have pretty hair.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone in this show is also fit and quite hot, despite being hikkies. Satou spent days in his room doing nothing (literally nothing, he\u2019s not aware of the existence of porn). He doesn\u2019t cook for himself and drinks a lot of beer. If you expected an overweight dude who looks like George Martin, you\u2019re bound for disappointment. Satou looks more like Brad Pitt in his Fight Club era with a shirt on and a less aggressive stare. If these guys opted for anything realistic, we would\u2019ve seen the consequences of isolation on Satou\u2019s body. Instead, he looks like a side-character from Free!.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story itself, don\u2019t expect any understanding of what pushes people to be hikkies. Don\u2019t expect a deep, dynamic psychology that reacts to the environment and is an active agent in the story. Any comparisons to WataMote are null, since this is the complete opposite. Tomoko struggled. She was lonely but she had to act and do things. We saw her failures, saw her difficulty and it made it so dark. What Tomoko goes through is our every social awkwardness, only every day.\\n\\n\r\nSatou doesn\u2019t really have to struggle. In fact, he\u2019s not much of a character at all. He has no desires, no life outside the story. He exists so others could pop at his door and force him to get help. It\u2019s not much of a struggle if all you do is react to situations. Sure, it\u2019s not enough to just be offered sex. You also have to go through the dilemma whether to say yes or no to that.\\n\\n\r\nThese are two different struggles. One man struggles with getting something, the other is being offered something and needs to accept it or reject it. The creators aren\u2019t aware of the difference. They don\u2019t know how to let a character drive a story, so they offer external conflicts he has to solve. The dilemma of whether to choose yes or no is hardly there, because the anime relies on events and not characters. If Satou chooses \u2018no\u2019, nothing actually happens. He doesn\u2019t have a personality to move on from that \u2018no\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nSatou, as a character, isn\u2019t an exaggeration. He\u2019s inconsistent. Despite spending years locked in his room, he doesn\u2019t know anything about video games or internet porn or, well, anything. Keep in mind Satou isn\u2019t an Unabomber-style hermit. Hikkies tend to have a hobby that keeps them in the house. Satou should\u2019ve done something during all this time, should\u2019ve gained some knowledge even if it\u2019s only about non-canonical Star Wars planets. He\u2019s completely ignorant of culture that it\u2019s most likely he spent the entire time staring at a wall.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not impossible, but shouldn\u2019t such a person be affected with a major disorder? Shouldn\u2019t that disorder affect every aspect of their life? Socially, Satou is perfectly fine. Whereas Tomoko struggles every second, Satou is relatively confident. The only time social weakness rears its head is when the creators need him to scream for comic effect. Oh look, a hikkie yelled bullshit and emberassed himself! That\u2019s some high-class humor!\\n\\n\r\nThe anime isn\u2019t really about the pains of being a shut-in. The conflict is solved in a few minutes around episode 23 \u2013 no psychology, no development. Suddenly there\u2019s a problem, so Satou walks out and he\u2019s no longer a hikkie. Rather, it\u2019s about the joys of conformity, how the world is a beautiful, welcoming place and you all should stop watching perverted anime and get in line. That\u2019s ironic, coming from a country where people \u2018conformed\u2019 and let the military run the Rape of Nanking and Unit 731.\\n\\n\r\nThe \u2018highlight\u2019, if you can call it that, is the anime\u2019s treatment of suicide. The idea life may not be worth living crosses the mind of the creators for no more than 5 seconds. Except for a brief moment, the creators go hammer about how irrational it is. The people in question have their reasons, but it\u2019s pushed aside using \u2018irrationality. At the end of the arc, some dude goes hammer about how their suicide will harm others and so they should stop. What an original argument. All of the philosophy behind is being shattered to pieces the size of the atom. Too bad the logic that fuels it can also be used to coerce people into rape, but better shut up before the thought police come.\\n\\n\r\nDarkness does exist in this anime, but it\u2019s either skimmed over or played for laughs. Misaki\u2019s and Yamazaki\u2019s darker sides exist, but Misaki\u2019s is barely allowed to surface. By the time it does, it reaches its expiration date and Misaki is the redemption. Her dark side never truly hurts Satou. The monologue that supposedly exposes her is to exaggerated, too comical to be a true confession. Like any other piece of darkness, it\u2019s more funny and has zero insight.\\n\\n\r\nBlack comedy shouldn\u2019t just have unpleasant topics. It should illuminate them. If you\u2019re going to laugh about sensitive subjects, you need to do more than be funny. So WataMote put us in Tomoko\u2019s shoes, dissecting her failures into little details, showing the absurdity and the pain. Even Borderlands takes violence seriously. Some of it is commentary on how lightly we take violence. By shocking us with how casually the characters treat violence, it gives us a mirror.\\n\\n\r\nYamazaki is a lonely dude who\u2019s inept with women. You don\u2019t see his failures, or the pain of rejection. You see him spit monologues about how awesome 2D girls are. It\u2019s quirky, funny and makes you feel good about yourself that you\u2019re not such a loser. Satou\u2019s inner monologues aren\u2019t unhinged enough to show a mental instability, but also not coherent enough to show deep thought behind them. It\u2019s funny that he \u2018hallucinates\u2019 weird, Doby-like things. Perhaps the voice actor is to blame. Satou reacts mostly by screaming, but that\u2019s once in a while. In general, he functions well enough.\\n\\n\r\nWhen they fail, it\u2019s always because they were too weird. The world is mostly benevolent, with the occasional schemer here and there. A few scenes comment on the isolation of the modern world, but it\u2019s always implied the characters brought themselves to this eternal isolation. It\u2019s such an optimistic view, a \u2018pull yourself by the bootstraps\u2019 crap people tell others because they think luck doesn\u2019t exist. Characters rarely deal with failure that\u2019s caused not necessarily because they\u2019re to blame, but because that\u2019s how the world works. Things just sometimes don\u2019t work.\\n\\n\r\nBased on Satou\u2019s situation, he could\u2019ve easily grabbed to Misaki and use her to increase her social skills. As a later character displays, in this world you can do anything if you only try. Said character starves from shutting himself in, so he crawls out and immediately finds a job. What a friendly world that is, where people walk to your door and offer to develop your social skills and where you can apply for any random job and be accepted.\\n\\n\r\nis a ridiculously optimistic anime that refuses to acknowledge the world isn\u2019t a happy happy joy joy place. Characters who feel bad are mocked or written as irrational morons. As we know, everyday other people walk to others\u2019 doors and offer help. What? It didn\u2019t happen to you? That\u2019s odd. Perhaps this anime isn\u2019t so realistic. Perhaps what makes something truly unrealistic is not things that cannot happen. Rather, it\u2019s when the meaning underneath the symbols \u2013 in this case, the optimism \u2013 is completely detached from reality.\\n\\n\r\n0.5 out of 5. I don\u2019t come up with a unique phrase for this crap",

            "content": "Welcome to the NHK (NHK ni Youkouso), first broadcast in 2006, is a fantastic series that mockingly celebrates deviant cultures versus their &ldquo;normal&rdquo; counterparts in modern Japan. This bizarre celebration is presented through a narrative focusing primarily on the protagonist Sato Tatsuhiro, those around him, and the struggles they face&mdash;at the center of which is Sato&rsquo;s concerning status of hikkikomori. \r\nA hikkikomori is different from an otaku, a term you&rsquo;re probably familiar with; the former is a person who refuses to work or spend much time outside the safety of their abode due to their inability to cope with society and pressure, consequently becoming moreand more confined to their quarters and less connected with the world. Their abundance is becoming a real problem, and not just in Japan&mdash;in England, such individuals are called NEET&rsquo;s (Neither Employed, Educated, or Trained).\\n\\n\r\nFor Sato, overcoming this status (which he blames on a conspiring organization known, oddly enough, as the NHK) is conducted by those around him: his endeavoring savior Misaki, his otaku neighbor Yamazaki, his enigmatic senpai Hitomi, and various others. These characters are incredibly dynamic, changing as Sato himself changes; you laugh with them, cry with them, and really get to &lsquo;know&rsquo; them, an aspect many shows&rsquo; characters lack. This cast of Welcome to the NHK is truly what makes the show fantastic, along with its plot, a witty, darkly-comedic satire on aspects of Japan&rsquo;s quirky culture and a touching, &lsquo;slice-of-life&rsquo; chronicle of Sato&rsquo;s struggle. \\n\\n\r\nIn the animation department, Gonzo gives us nothing special. The animation is nothing out-of-the-ordinary or anything avant-garde, background characters are simplified as usual, and there aren&rsquo;t many high-octane action scenes which would require anything intense or careful. However, due to the nature of the show, such normalcy is acceptable. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is another fantastic element of the show, though. The soundtrack (which I strongly suggest you give a listen) is a superb mix of minimal bluesy acoustic stuff, grungy J-rock, creepy minimalism, and progressive J-pop. All four opening and ending themes are great, my personal favorite being the second ending theme, &quot;Modokashii Sekai no Ue de&quot; by Yui Makino. The voice actors, for the most part, are spot on. Sato&rsquo;s voice actor, Koizumi Yutaka, does a particularly fantastic job, which for me was reminiscent of Sugita Tomokazu, Kyon&rsquo;s seiyuu in The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Welcome to the NHK is a solid anime definitely worth watching. It is certainly one of 2006&rsquo;s best non-seinen titles, and a fantastic show to kick back with after a long day.  \\n",

            "content": "I can honestly say that I've never been so happy to be done with a series. This show is barely watchable, and it all stems from the main character.\r\nThe Worst Person In The Entire World\r\nAt first, I thought I'd really enjoy the show. The first 6-8 episodes or so have a unique feel with some decent comedy and interesting characters, but then it takes a turn that it never recovers from. The main character, Sato, is a twenty-something-year-old version of your boiler plate Shinji character, but it doesn't seem that way at first. Don't be fooled; once he starts exhibiting the cliche weak, hesitant, self-centered,clueless characteristics we find in way too many anime, you will loathe him for the remainder of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSato is not a NEET; he's not an hikikomori; he's not otaku; he's just an awful person. Clearly the author believes he's an hikikomori since they need to say that on average 4 times an episode, but throughout the show you will see him constantly switch in and out of being perfectly fine in society and completely scared. You could argue that the switch coincides with how is life is going, but the polarity between the two states is jarring and completely unconvincing. Additionally, even though he's supposed to be a shut-in of 4 years, he has no hobbies that would indicate he's done anything except stare at a wall for that time. He's not otaku, he doesn't play online games, and he isn't even aware that you can search for porn on the Internet.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the show completely unbearable to watch is how entirely self-centered he is. Unlike him, all of the supporting characters have had real hard-ships (some much harder than others). While he remains completely inward-focused, he never asks his friends about their problems or tries to understand what they are going through. This is a man who even raises his fist multiple times to the one person who is 100% unconditionally supportive and caring to him; even when she's in complete tears, he says nothing to her. Instead, he goes home to contemplate how he is affected by what she was saying. Not even a thought about her or what kind of pain she was going through.\\n\\n\r\nThe Saving Angel\\n\r\nAside from the main character, the supporting characters are actually quite interesting. Most prominently, Misaki, is a beautiful person who by far has been through the worst of it. In all honesty, this show could've been terrific if she was the main character. If it weren't because I wanted to see how her story unfolded, there is no way I could've made it all the way to the end.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nCharacters aside, the story had a few problems as well. The biggest problem is that the series takes a few random deviations (kind of like mini-arcs) that are incredibly far outside the realm of the main plot. Including an in-world MMO subplot that lasts a few episodes. They were too distracting, not to mention boring. There were also some major consistency issues as it pertains to the passage of time and the balance of money. You could say these are small details, but the passage of time was to the degree that at one moment the implication was that a month had passed and then just a few minutes later that only a few days had passed.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is also way too long; it could've and should've ended at episode 13. It even has a great climactic feel to it, but for some reason another 11 episodes of misery await.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI love the way the characters are drawn in this series. The art is without a doubt the best aspect of the show. The only thing that was bizarre is that Misaki was the only character that wore the same t-shirt and skirt throughout the entire show. Every other character had different outfits, but even though she actually had a job, she apparently had no wardrobe. There's one part of the show that could imply this was intentional, but I'll avoid a potential spoiler by dismissing it.\\n\\n\r\nComedy\\n\r\nThe beginning of the show has some funny parts; after that, there's less than a handful of parts to get a chuckle out of. You can see where they were trying to be funny, but it falls flat.\\n\\n\r\nExecution\\n\r\nThe visuals and environment are quite nice, and the music is enjoyable too. The voice acting is really well done, and the subs (watched on funimation) were also good. In terms of execution, the show was done quite well.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thought\\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend this to anybody who doesn't want to be on the verge of tossing a perfectly good screen out the window. The amount of frustration that comes from watching Sato continuously portray the type of person who does nothing but completely absorb himself in his own misery had me throwing double-birds at my screen over and over again. Do not start this show because you will probably get sucked into something that seems pretty good until around episode 7.",

            "content": "NHK ni Youkoso! or Welcome to the NHK! is something truly special that the medium of animation has offered us. From the fascinating and unique concept to the absorbing and seemingly very real characters, NHK ni Youkoso! has a power to engage and indulge the audience into something that is extremely relatable to oneself. \r\nThe story is focused around a seemingly normal guy named Sato Tatsuhiro; Who's a college dropout and relies on the pocket money given by his parents for a living. However this is just a prerequisite of what actually lies within Sato and that the show tries to explore into and conveyto us -- That is the concept of being a \"Hikikomori\" (A person who tends to refrain from making contact, both verbally and socially to anyone). This is the basic premise of the show as we're treated to a 22-year old NEET (Not in Employment, Education or Training) who's been this way since about 4 years now and is starting to believe that everything happening around him and the also the state he's currently in is the result of a shady and secret organization named \"Nihon Hikikomori Kyokai (NHK)\" or \"Japan's Hikikomori Withdrawal Association\". Things, however, seem to take a different route as Sato soon meets a 17-year old girl named Misaki, who claims that she's gonna rescue Sato by making him participate in a project in order to make him live a normal life again. This project takes on a primary theme in the show and thus making \"Welcome to the NHK!\" a suitable title for this show. What lies ahead is the black-comedy drama which is extremely touching and at times hilarious and ludicrous as Sato and Misaki commence an escapade from this world of social anxiety for Sato, along with a few other friends. Themes of lack of self-confidence, appeasing oneself in a solitary world and various conspiracies stirred out behind the back of people are frequent in this show. \\n\\n\r\nSato Tatsuhiro is the central character of the show who has an illness of being a hikikomori and with whom the whole show is centered around. There is not a proper skill or an attribute that Sato possesses other than being a lazy college dropout with nothing to do. However this does not make him either one-dimensional or typical, but on the contrary it makes it difficult to properly explain his characteristic. You have to guess it yourself, or rather put yourself in his place and relate. And that is something I was able to greatly do, as each an every inch of his character development in the show is closely relatable. This also makes him an interesting main character in a show, someone that you don't quite see that often in an anime. Misaki is another central figure in the show but not a whole lot is revealed about her until the latter part of the show. So much so that it isn't even made clear that why is she performing the project? And why is it Sato that has been chosen for her project? And also, what is the profit for Misaki by doing this project? All we know is that Sato meets her by chance, gets known of the project by Misaki and unexpectedly agrees to it. This doesn't make the viewer retaliate or question against it immediately though as the show tends to the keep the viewer engrossed in it. \\n\\n\r\nTwo other characters play a very important role in the show, Yamazaki Kaoru and Kashiwa Hitomi. Yamazaki was once a junior of Sato when he was in school, and later in the show Sato actually discovers that the irritating otaku freak next door is actually Yamazaki himself. \\n\r\nYamazaki is also an important person for Sato, as he's the only guy he hangs out with all day and talks with. He is depicted as a huge anime fan, and almost 24x7 songs of \"Pururin\" and other stuff keeps on playing in his room fulled with stuff related to anime. As the show progresses Yamazaki convinces Sato for his help in creating a game, which would help both of them if it sells and thus it also acts as a secondary plot in the show. Kashiwa Hitomi is another female side character in the show and probably the oldest and first friend of Sato. Sato usually calls her \"Senpai\" or as senior and she's the head of the literature club which included Sato in their school days. Kashiwa is quite a depressed character, as she believes that everything bad that happens around her is a conspiracy. She's actually the one who may have a influence on why Sato believes that there's a secret organization trying to push him away from society. It's not entirely doubtful that Sato might have had a crush on her since his school days, which isn't the same for the opposite though. Sato seems to have a respect to Kashiwa as he only calls her as Senpai and not her name. \\n\\n\r\nNow this is heading to the spoiler territory a little, so you're warned:\\n\r\nAbout halfway through the show, Kashiwa gets very depressed as she gets a trip planned together with her boyfriend gets abruptly cancelled as he gets called for work, and as a result she takes part in the \"Off\" meeting on the internet, which is a group of lonely and depressed people planning to take their life away in a far away island soon after meeting up. Sato, completely ignorant of the whole scenario agrees to come along with Kashiwa to the meeting. It all ends quite depressingly but also a lot of hilarity ensues and in the end it teaches us all a lesson. Spoilers end here.\\n\\n\r\nThere's another female character and an old classmate of Sato who makes a cameo after halfway through the series, Kobayashi Megumi. Class rep of Sato back in his school days, the little life story of Megumi plays a primary role in the latter part of the show. She becomes an orphan after the death of his father and has to feed herself and her brother all on her own. She gets caught in a shady scheme by some manufacturing company and tries to drag Sato in it too. Sato, of course, gets dragged in it easily and finds himself in a pinch where he has to sell all the merchandise at any cost to earn money. It all comes at a sad end where Sato, accompanied by Misaki and Yamazaki go back to Megumi to cancel the deal and this is where he learns that her brother is also an hikikomori shut-in, albeit in a much more extreme condition that in what Sato is in currently. It has a depressing ending to it but an important life lesson can be learned from it.\\n\\n\r\nComing to the sound section, the audience is greeted by a beautiful opening song \"Puzzle\" by ROUND TABLE feat. Nino. I won't go in to too much details of it but it's a lovely OP which sets the stage for the show. The first ending is a wacky one with insane lyrics and vocals. Very much different than the second ED sung by the voice actor of Misaki herself, and has a lively tone to it. The OP stays the same throughout the show but there's just a slight version edit of it to make it as the second OP theme. The voice acting in the show was satisfying. Sato's voice acting matches his characteristics perfectly and so did Misaki's. I checked out the voice actor of Sato in this site and it turns out that he's only done a handful of shows which was pretty surprising to me. Moving on to the art aspect of NHK. This is the first show from Studio Gonzo that I watched and the art style is pretty goofy at times but it's not bad at all and I got used to it pretty soon. NHK isn't the most aesthetically pleasing shows and the visuals have a minimalistic art style which in fact helps to the premise of the show. \\n\\n\r\nI loved NHK because it uses a real-life phenomenon and a delicate matter such as social anxiety. All the character in the series fared extremely well and it was as if I was in their mind knowing exactly how they felt and this is especially true for Sato. This series also teaches us a lesson that being a \"hikikomori\" is not actually a disease or disorder, but a luxury in itself. The way Sato used to live his life off the money from his parents, and the brilliant ending of Megumi and his brother's story. No matter how bad the hikikomori condition of a person is, but if he/she's pushed to the limit there's no other way to work hard. That's the only way you could truly stand on your own two legs. Welcome to the NHK! needs to be watched to be believed. Rarely did I thought that an anime out of all other mediums would get this close to my heart by the time I bid it farewell. \\n",

            "content": "The word \u201cotaku\u201d used to be extremely derogatory, but in recent years, the word has become a lot less negative with many people (the users of Myanimelist for example) coming to identify themselves as otaku. However, this is still a major problem in Japan.  We have the idea that it\u2019s pretty normal for someone in Japan to obsess about anime and manga. However over there, \u201cotaku\u201d is used to describe someone that\u2019s weird, unskilled, lacks the competence to be in a healthy relationship and/or can\u2019t secure a stable job. \r\nThis is what Welcome to the NHK is about, the story of such an otaku\u2019slife in Japan. This is my review.\\n\\n\r\nContains Minor Spoilers\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe story Welcome to the NHK is about 22 year-old, Satou Tatsuhiro, an otaku/NEET/hikimori. He\u2019s unemployed, sleeps for 16 hours a day and goes grocery shopping at night with money his parents send him. He has the idea that that everyone and everything is against him and it\u2019s supposedly all part of some convoluted conspiracy theory.  He reluctantly joins a program which will help him get over his paranoia and in the process, better his way of living. Welcome to the NHK is part drama, part romance, part black comedy, part psychological thriller, part satire and part slice of life. It shows us the life of an otaku in a realistic way, but it\u2019s able to combine drama and comedy with everyday life. For instance, it explored unemployment in a way where it could make us laugh and think at the same time. Unemployment is a very serious issue all over the world, but I just couldn\u2019t help but laugh at how it was shown in Welcome to the NHK. However it also shows the consequences of unemployment and how it can affect the individual. If it\u2019s from psychological thriller to drama to comedy and back to drama again, the executions of the tonal shifts is smooth and doesn\u2019t come off as awkward because even though Welcome to the NHK falls under so many genres, it manages to have a certain direction of knowing where it wants to go. If it\u2019s serious, it\u2019s serious and if it\u2019s funny, it\u2019s funny. This works because Welcome to the NHK is never all over the place tonally.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nWelcome to the NHK has a distinct look. The characters aren\u2019t that refined. Sometimes their noses disappear and their designs aren\u2019t greatly detailed. There\u2019s not really a lot to say, other than that\u2019s it really simplistic and plain. The background characters sometimes appear as faceless. It sounds awful but you get used to it by the first episode. It has a certain charm, because it isn\u2019t the type of animation you\u2019d often see and the show manages to make it work.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with the English dub. I haven\u2019t seen the subbed version but the English voice actors all did a wonderful job. Chris Patton and Greg Ayres are extremely talented voice actors who seem to embody the roles of Satou and Yamazaki, respectively.  Both of them seem to have chemistry with their respective characters when interacting with one another and just really fit their animated counter parts. While Stephanie Wittels isn\u2019t as well known as the former two, she did a wonderful job as Misaki, coming off as sweet, confident and manages to be cute without putting on a grating voice. Welcome to the NHK has a wonderful opening. Puzzle is just so catchy and upbeat. The remix used as the second opening gets rid of the trumpet which is kind of disappointing because something that small drastically changes ones opinion of the song, which makes you wonder why the show didn\u2019t just use the first opening all the way through. The first ED sounds like a high energy nonsensical rant that\u2019s just not that enjoyable to listen to. The second ED, was actually really nice. Slow and soft, it was just a wonderful track that closed an episode off nicely.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nSatou is otaku personified. He\u2019s obsessive, unsocial, unemployed etc. What makes him such a great character is that he has more flaws than perfections. He makes a lot of mistakes. He is someone that thinks isolation is capable of physically strengthening an individual and so decides to break a beer bottle with his hand because of his ridiculous reasoning. He connects dots that\u2019s not there and comes up with conspiracy theories that are laughable. But he tries to better himself. He knows that he can change his lifestyle. He takes control to fix his mistakes and that\u2019s why you love him so much. He\u2019s funny, really weird and goofy, but he doesn\u2019t want to be an otaku. Misaki and Yamazaki are two of the three leads and they were fun to watch. Their interactions with Satou were hysterical. Misaki\u2019s meetings with Satou and the antics of Satou and Yamazaki was just really enjoyable. These were characters that grow on you over time because you feel like they\u2019re just young ordinary people living their lives who also had their own personal problems and hassles to worry about. Like the story, they were down to earth. Everyone else in the story had a part to play. No one ever just showed up to fill up space. They were part of a story, and everyone seemed to have a direct or indirect influence of Satou\u2019s life.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nWelcome to the NHK is very perculiar. Watching it, I noticed, I have never ever seen something like this before. Because of this it took a few episodes for me to fully enjoy it. It was funny, but laughing at the expense of Satou made me feel bad, because it gave me a glimpse of what an otaku\u2019s life is like. It showed me the the daily lives of these individuals, how their psyche works, how they think and how they struggle. You can actually see yourself in Satou because of his flawed nature. All the characters weren\u2019t just moving cardboards and the story was weirdly entertaining. Welcome to the NHK is smart and definitely something that you can watch more than once.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nWelcome to the NHK is one of the most beloved and critically praised anime NOT named Neon Genesis Evangelion. It actually shares quite a bit with Evangelion both for better and for worse as I will explain in my review. Both are series that can be described as essential viewing, thought provoking, meritorious, but also quite frustrating to watch at times.\r\nStory and characters: \r\ncontains some Spoilers!!!\r\nThe main character is Sato, who lives alone in an apartment that his parents pay for. He is unemployed and has no drive to try find a job or interact with the outside world at all. He represents the Japanesecultural phenomenon of Hikikomori that you have probably seen referenced in other anime. There are also many people in their twenties in the US that are unemployed and live with their parents, but that isn't quite the same as Japan's hikikomori. American \"Millennials\" living at home still tend to socialize, drive, and have friends that they often visit. Hikikomori tend to combine their unemployment and dependency with an extreme social phobia and agoraphobia. Part of this is likely due to the feeling of deep shame and fear of being judged that their American counterparts largely lack. Americans will simply dismiss unemployment as the result of a bad jobs market, but to Japanese it is a complete disgrace to both the individual and their families. \\n\\n\r\nSato's life changes when he meets an unusual girl named Misaki, who becomes obsessed with curing Sato of his condition. She forces him to meet with her in the park, where she reads passages from Freud and Jung. Misaki forces Sato into signing a contract and taking up her \"therapy program\". However, she doesn't know that he is going to be an unusually difficult case. In addition to being a hikikomori, Sato is also a paranoid schizophrenic that suffers from delusions of persecution. He believes in a shadowy organization called the NHK, that is obsessed with trying to keep him a hikikomori. In order to convince Misaki that he has his life together, Sato teams up with his otaku neighbor Kaoru to try create an \"eroge\" or erotic video game. Sato briefly tries attending a video game design college alongside Kaoru, but he has another episode of paranoia and can't bring himself to return. \\n\\n\r\nAnother sub-plot is started when Sato ends up meeting his old high school crush, Hitomi. Sato was in his school's literature club with Hitomi, where they were literally the only members. I apologize for that terrible pun! They even celebrated their upcoming graduation by having sex on the teacher's desk one school day afternoon because NO ONE in that school ever went near the literature club apparently. Hitomi has become a successful government employee since graduation, but is frustrated because she often runs into office bureaucracy that stops her from implementing any of the reforms she wishes to make. Hitomi also seems to suffer from clinical depression, for which she takes many pills off label. Despite the fact that Sato looks rather disheveled and has become a complete failure... and despite the fact that she has a very successful boyfriend, Hitomi still flirts with Sato and seems to still have feelings for him. This predictably leads to a love triangle and unpredictably leads to Sato accidentally joining a suicide cult with Hitomi. However, since this is a comedy drama, they are prevented from killing themselves and Sato continues in his struggles. As the series goes on, we also learn about Misaki's background, Kaoru's background, and see the development of the relation between Sato and Misaki.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Music:\\n\\n\r\nThe music isn't amazing in my opinion, but certainly isn't bad either. The art is overall excellent and combines great character models with impressive backgrounds including Sato's many schizophrenic hallucinations. This is a top dollar production, so you would expect it to look phenomenal and for the most part it does. \\n\\n\r\nIssues:\\n\\n\r\n1.\\n\\n\r\nThe first real issue I had with this series is that it is advertised as a drama/comedy. However,  the comedy tends to fall flat FAR more often than not. Take for example the sub-plot about making an eroge. This sounds funny on paper and maybe it was funnier in the original novel, but it didn't get a lot of laughs from me in the anime adaptation. I'm aware that NHK was always intended to be a drama first and a comedy second, but when the likes of \"Lost in Translation\" and \"Sideways\" are SO much funnier than your comedy, why even bother having a comedy element at all? \\n\\n\r\n2.\\n\\n\r\nI applaud NHK for tackling the uncomfortable issue of hikikomori with the grace and dignity that it did, without just harshly dismissing them as losers and basement dwellers. However, I think it tried to tackle too many issues at once. Why must Sato in addition to being a hikikomori ALSO be a schizophrenic, Kaoru a Lolicon, and Misaki suffer from borderline personality disorder? Why must EVERY character in the entire series attempt suicide at least once?! Apparently the anime actually toned down the characters from the original novel in order to make them more believable and focus primarily on the hikikomori issue, instead of every mental issue known to mankind. However, if that is the case then why leave in all the mental issues?! Sato's schizophrenia and alcoholism that were very serious issues in the original novel are basically reduced to a joke in the anime! Many other anime are guilty of this crime of shoehorning in extra issues, like Elfen Lied and its random pedophilia abuse sub-plot, but even Elfen Lied didn't leave it in only to reduce it to a fucking joke! That really left a bad taste in my mouth, which is a shame because NHK can be brilliant at other moments.\\n\\n\r\n3.\\n\\n\r\nThe last major issue with NHK is pacing and struggling to adapt what worked in the novel into a TV series. During the story about the suicide cult, we spend at least 3 LONG, hard to watch episodes in which we already know that Sato and Hitomi aren't going to kill themselves halfway through a dramedy. Does the series reward us for trudging through those 1.5 hours? Does Sato have a moment of character growth and stop the suicide pact? Nope. Some random guy that we didn't see before and never see again ends up stopping it. Hitomi is then saved by her boyfriend who arrives just in the nick of time and our hero tries to kill himself because Hitomi is going to go back to her boyfriend. I understand that Sato is a protagonist with serious issues and isn't supposed to always be likeable, but rather a flawed individual struggling to overcome the obstacles in his life. However, that long and draining arc only to be rewarded with one of the most selfish and loathsome character moments was frustrating beyond belief! This was all done to show character growth and increase the drama when Sato stops yet ANOTHER character from committing suicide. However, that doesn't occur for another 13 episodes or roughly 6 fucking hours, when I was so frustrated with Sato that it wasn't as moving as it should have been. You generally can't in a TV or film adaptation spend hours and hours making the audience dislike a character and then give him a faceturn in the last second and expect everyone to instantly love him and start cheering. That's terrible pacing! NHK is a series that often seems to drag its heels and can be VERY slow and exasperating. A novel can afford to be slower, dryer, and more philosophical because the reader controls the rate of reading. If I am stressed and in a foul mood, I don't have to read 100 pages of the slower parts of the novel. If I have the flu and I reach the part in War and Peace where Natasha is trying on dresses for 10 pages, I can put the book down and read later. A show comes in 30 minute chunks and people want to watch a show in as few sittings as possible. This is a 10 hour anime that probably only needed to be 4 hours long to tell the actually relevant, important story and had 5 hours about as fun as getting your toenails torn off. If I wasn't a completionist, I would have dropped this series like a bad habit halfway through.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIf you manage to grind it out and watch the entire series, the result is pretty good. This is still THE anime that did the best job of tackling the hikikomori issue and has some powerful episodes like episode 14. I can easily see why this series has recieved the praise that it has and I would say that it DOES deserve that praise overall. However, I wish that more people would address some of the issues the series has and give more of a warning that this is NOT light, enjoyable viewing. Even if you love this series, it is a disservice to future viewers to just praise it and give no warnings about how difficult to watch it often is. I went in expecting The Producers and I got Schindler's List. Those are both good movies, but if you walk into an emotionally draining and difficult to watch film with no warning, it feels like getting punched in the face! While I would recommend this anime, I don't do so lightly. This is a series to watch if you have plenty of time and are looking for deep reflection, not a watch with friends and drink beer kind of show.\\n",

            "content": "\"A really huge, strong snake appeared. It dove into the ocean, and I stuck a thick sword into an apple. Also, I blasted away all around me with a black, shining, amazing gun.\" \u2014 Tatsuhiro Satou\r\nIt sure took me a while to get that \"deep\" dialogue by Satou if you know what I mean. *wink* * wink*\r\nNHK ni Youkoso! or Welcome to the NHK! is a psychological anime presented in a humorous way. It's definitely one of the most unique and depressing anime I've watched thus far and I found myself laughing out loud every time our main protagonist, Satou, makes a fool out ofhimself but that laughter can very quickly change to depression, and at times I ask myself \"Is this suppose to be funny or depressing?\". With all the tragedy, drama and comedy this show has to offer, it's a definite roller coaster of emotions. It's not perfect (well what is?), but NHK definitely deserves a spot on my top five favorite anime of all time.\\n\\n\r\nJust in case you don't know...\\n\\n\r\nHikikomori - (literally \"pulling inward, being confined\", i.e., \"acute social withdrawal\") a Japanese term to refer to the phenomenon of reclusive adolescents or adults who withdraw from social life, often seeking extreme degrees of isolation and confinement. [Wikipedia]\\n\\n\r\nNEET - Not in Education, Employment, or Training.\\n\\n\r\nNHK - (Nippon Hoso Kyokai or Japan Broadcasting Corporation) is Japan's national public broadcasting organization. [Wikipedia]\\n\\n\r\n*STORY: 9/10\\n\r\nWhile the main plot revolves around Satou trying to get rid of his hikikomori lifestyle, most of the episodes are about Satou getting caught in series of unfortunate (but funny) events. NHK is divided into several arcs dealing with real growing social problems in the world and somehow Satou always finds himself caught up in this weird situations. From extreme online gaming addiction to getting involved in a scam, Satou will get himself in all sorts of trouble just to be saved in time by his friends Misaki and Yamazaki (sometimes). \\n\\n\r\nNHK is pretty dark and gloomy in general. The mood of the show is heavy and depressing but it also delivers effective humor for comic relief that really helps balance things out. \\n\\n\r\nRomance is only a subplot in the show but it does play a major role in the progression of the story, especially towards the ending. However, I found the romance a little disappointing because I was expecting a more conclusive ending with a solid romantic resolution. In the end I found myself staring at the screen expecting more when the credits started rolling. But even though the love between our main couple was left open-ended, it's not necessarily a total let down. There is still some satisfaction to be had on this one.\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the show is slow in general (sometimes excruciatingly slow) but overall concept of the show is quite unique and well executed. \\n\\n\r\n*CHARACTERS: 9/10\\n\r\nThere are only four relevant characters in NHK and all four of them have some serious mental issues. Let start off with our not-so-normal main protagonist Tatsuhiro Satou, a 22-year-old delusional bitch living the life of a hikikomori. Satou thinks that the broadcasting station NHK is plotting a conspiracy by making people addicted anime. Best character 10/10. The second most important character and also Satou's love interest is Nakahara Misaki, a high school student who's \"helping\" Satou with his hikikomori problem by involving Satou in her \"big project\". Also there's Yamazaki Kaoru, a super-otaku and probably the sanest of the bunch. He is Satou's junior in high school and later in the anime his best friend. And lastly, we have Kashiwa Hitomi who's just background character but she plays an important role in the story, actually we wouldn't even have a story in the first place without her. Hitomi is Satou's senior and friend in high school who is also a delusional bitch. She has a deep fascination for conspiracy theories which is basically what lead to her into becoming a delusional bitch and was kind enough to involve Satou in it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters is definitely the strongest point of the NHK. We have well-rounded and easily relatable characters. They are society's misfits, not really sure what's the significance of their life but that is where character development kicks in and we start to see them grow into amazing characters although sometimes I like to strangle Satou for making the dumbest descisions.\\n\\n\r\n*ART: 7/10\\n\r\nWhile the art overall is pretty decent, there are some noticeable flaws. There are times when the characters are drawn kind of weird and slightly looking different. I don't know the reason for this, maybe they are low on budget or something, but it can really get on my nerves sometimes. And I think Satou looked a little too old for a 22-year-old. I understand that Satou isn't really living a very healthy lifestyle but I think they overdid it a little. But if you're not really that particular in anime art quality I don't think you would even care about these stuffs or even notice them so it's not really that much big of a problem. \\n\\n\r\n*SOUND: 8/10\\n\r\nI loved all the OP and ED they used in the anime. The opening theme \"Puzzle\" is a very catchy song by Round Table feat. Nino. They are amazing as always. The ending themes were also great. The first ED \"Odoru Akachan Ningen\" is rock song with an intentional out-of-tune sound that really goes well with the crazy psychological aspect of NHK and the second ED \"Modokashii Sekai no Ue De\" which is more of a sad song which I also like.\\n\\n\r\nAlso there is one particular song in this anime that I just have to mention. It's the \"Purupurupururin\" song which is sang by a fictional idol in NHK. This song is played a lot of times in the series and Satou even made it his ringtone (I'm confused why though because Yamazaki is the fan not Satou). This song is extremely annoying in the beginning but after hearing it several times I actually found it to be very catchy. I even downloaded it and made it my alarm tone, but after using it as my alarm tone for a week, it became really annoying again. Lol\\n\\n\r\n*OVERALL/ENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall, Welcome to the NHK! is highly enjoyable and as you can see, I gave this anime a perfect 10. That just proves how much I enjoyed watching this anime, but since we all have our own personal preferences there is no guarantee you'll enjoy NHK as much as I did. I don't really recommend this to kids since NHK does contain adult themes and some nudity (heck, if you're a growing boy why not?) but other than that I think everyone should give this a try. Even if you're not into psychological anime (like me) you might still enjoy this because Welcome to the NHK, while it has it's shortcomings, is a masterpiece in it's own way.",

            "content": "The anime industry is littered with shows that serve as forms of escapism, ones that whisk you away from the troubles of life, allowing you to enter a magical world free from the dread of reality. However, a few works choose to take a less conventional path, going against the grain and choosing instead to use their time to confront reality. Welcome to the NHK is one of these works, being a painful experience that is never afraid to shy away from the harsher realities of life.\r\nAt its heart, Welcome to the NHK is an exploration into the perils of life - the many painsthat each of us go through on a daily basis. Loneliness, depression, addiction, feelings of desolation and the inability to hope - all of these are things that many of us have experienced at some points in our lives. Through its wide cast of characters, Welcome to the NHK brings out the worst in us humans, often painting their pain through painfully awkward situations and depressingly dark humor. It is an excellent exploration into the downs that we can go through, and I am sure that many of us can at least relate to the show on some level.\\n\\n\r\nYet, it is not a show devoid of hope. Despite the hopelessness of the situations and the characters, it is clear that the show's message is that there is ultimately hope. Even if things might look bleak, human warmth can and will triumph, and dark times will pass. It's ultimate message is that good things will happen if you keep living, and the gift of life is something precious that cannot be thrown away easily even if times appear bad. But to do so, it is necessary to take that step forward, and be willing to work hard. That is the primary thing that you are meant to take away from the show, and I think that it is a very relatable message that will certainly touch the hearts of most. \\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, this is done well, but unfortunately, there are several flaws in the writing. There are a few little things that deter from the show, the most notable being a romance element that is introduced halfway through the series, but is sidelined and never touched upon till the end of the series. It sometimes feels like there is a lack of continuity due to the main character's inability to do something to change despite all that he has been through, but perhaps that could be chalked up as yet another exploration of the failure of human nature.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Welcome to the NHK was a very interesting experience personally. It is certainly very different from the standard shows in anime, and is an exploration of the problems that plague its very own target audience - painful and ugly problems that many would choose to hide. It is a show that chooses to confront reality instead of serving to escape from it, and is done moderately well, though there are several flaws in the writing. It is still a mostly excellent show which carries a very meaningful message and one that I absolutely adored.\\n\\n\r\nDo yourself a favor and watch this show - it is one of the few that can make you learn more about yourself  and affect your personal views of life.",

            "content": "I have to admit that I have put off watching this anime for quite some time, despite having heard many good things about it. A series about an anti-social, unemployed otaku who apparently isn't in the best psychological state to boot? How interesting could an anime like this possibly be? But with nothing to do on a rainy Monday, I finally decided to give Welcome to the NHK! a chance to gain my approval. It did much more than that. It also managed to win over my heart with its loveable characters and my brain with the numerous philosophical questions it poses. I couldn't stopthinking about it for the next couple of days. I even had a dream about it - an amazing feat - considering not even my guilty pleasure, Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, managed to accomplish that.  As great as this series is, I must warn you ahead of time that it arguably isn't suitable for all age groups.  And I'm not just talking about the occasional gratuitous fanservice or frequent sexual references and jokes. Frankly speaking, Welcome to the NHK! is a depressing anime. It will undoubtedly cause you to have cynical thoughts, and for those of you who already have a pessimistic outlook on life, it will probably make you even more cynical. Therefore, I would only be able to recommend this series to a mature audience, namely people who are over 18 and are currently enrolled in university/college or who have already joined the workforce. I am not saying that someone younger than 18 would not enjoy the series to the same degree that I did. I just feel like the series is more geared towards an older audience because it tackles numerous issues that often plague us young adults.  \\n\\n\r\nNow that all the 'do not watch the anime if you are depressed' warnings are out of the way, it's time to get down to the details of why Welcome to the NHK! has managed to crawl its way up to #2 in my favourite animes list.  \\n\\n\r\nThis will probably be the longest section of the review, for a good reason. Welcome to the NHK! is truly a story-driven anime. And by story, I don't necessarily mean plot, because its method of story-telling is not conventional by any means. Realistically speaking, Welcome to the NHK! doesn't have many elements that would normally make you want to watch an anime. It doesn't have flashy fight sequences, bubbly romantic scenes, or any of the melodrama that seems to be omnipresent in most of the popular slice-of-life animes. So what IS it about? Simply put, it's a story about life without any Hollywood-inspired drama. And it manages to depict the struggles of the protagonist, as well as those of numerous side characters, to find their footing in the most realistic manner possible. Put dramatic masterpieces like Clannad: After Story aside for the sake of truly enjoying this series. \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows Satou Tatsuhiro, a dysfunctional college drop out, as he, sometimes humourously, battles numerous social problems one after the other. He sleeps his days away, indulges in alcohol, smoking, and junk food, and has not left his apartment for three years. Faced with constant paranoia that a secret organization, the N.H.K., is conspiring against him to make his life as miserable as possible, Satou desperately searches for a way to escape his hikkomori ways. One day, a mysterious girl named Misaki Nakahara shows up, and offers to help him change his life, on the condition that he signs a contract to participate in a 'project' that she is conducting. What follows is a roller coaster ride of ups and downs and twists and turns as Satou struggles to find a purpose in his seemingly meaningless life. \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Welcome to the NHK! such a successful series is that it manages to tell a story on two completely different levels. I think most people watch the series expecting a unique blend of romance, comedy, and drama. If you are one of these people, you won't be disappointed, because Welcome to the NHK! delivers. I honestly can't say how many times I couldn't stop myself from laughing out loud during the series, and while the humour is occasionally bizarre and sometimes even borderline black comedy, it is thoroughly delightful to watch. On the other side of the spectrum, we have the drama. As I have already discussed, the drama is extremely realistic and never forced for the sake of inciting an emotional response. Admittedly, there are numerous scenes in the anime that are genuinely painful to watch, not because of the addition of uplifting music or moving dialogue, but rather because they are so believable that you could easily imagine yourself in a similar situation. As a result, these scenes truly touched my heart and allowed me to empathize, and not sympathize, with the characters. Hopefully, they will have a similar effect on those of you who choose to watch the anime. Finally, we have the budding romance between Satou and Misaki. Although the least important and least used of the three main story elements, it is a welcome addition to the plot that certainly enhances the enjoyability of the series. I'm not going to lie; I honestly think that the romantic scenes in Welcome to the NHK! were done far better than those in some romance-centered animes. Like the drama, it is genuine but never exaggerated, heart-warming but never, for the lack of a better word, cheesy. As much as I hate to admit it for the sake of my manliness, I wish that the series had focused more on the romantic relationship between Satou and Misaki because my heart went all doki-doki whenever I saw them together. There, I said it. \\n\\n\r\nBut Welcome to the NHK! has even more to offer. Setting all the drama, comedy, and romance aside, you're left with a realistic and insightful depiction of the numerous social problems that exist in Japanese culture. It is difficult to discuss these problems in detail without some unintentional spoilers, so I will simply say that the story examines some of Japan's most dysfunctional sub-cultures, including, evidently, hikkomoris, but also otakus, MMORPG fanatics, and even suicide cults. Satou finds himself entangled with the endeavours of all of these groups and, through having to deal with the consequences of his actions, gains invaluable insight on the direction he should be heading in his life. Since Satou becomes involved in all of these social circles, the audience is, consequently, presented with an up close and personal portrayal of seemingly distant concepts, hopefully providing some degree of understanding and justification. \\n\\n\r\nSo far, I have only been praising the series.  However, I do have some small complaints, one of which is that the comedy sometimes feels out of place. Don't get me wrong; I love how the series succeeded in portraying such serious issues in a humourous light. But too many times did I find myself with a sinking feeling in my chest, on the verge of crying, only to be interrupted by an absurd but hilarious comment by Satou or one of his epically funny faces. I think the most inappropriate of these comedic moments occurred during the climax in the final episode. I expected to see a touching and emotional scene coupled with dramatic music and hopefully, some romantic action, but I instead received an absurd sequence where Satou, once again, rambles on about how the sinister N.H.K is the root of all evil in the world and eventually does something equally absurd. Ugh, way to get me all worked up for nothing.\\n\\n\r\nAnother issue I have with the anime lies with the unfolding of the plot itself. The story is divided into several arcs that, while seemingly unrelated, all contribute to the building of Satou's character and eventually lead to a 'resolution' at the end of the series. However, I felt as if the story occasionally lacked a sense of direction. The problem with having a mix of light-hearted and funny episodes to contrast the dramatic and heart-wrenching episodes is that, at times, you become unsure of what exactly the anime is trying to accomplish. This isn't much of a complaint, as I honestly think the pacing of the story was excellent. Perhaps my critical side is just forcing itself out.  \\n\\n\r\nTo sum it all up, Welcome to the NHK! has something to offer to everyone. For serious anime watchers, it provides insightful commentary on issues not normally tackled in mainstream media, and for the more light-hearted anime watcher, its nice blend of romance, comedy, and drama makes for a delightfully enjoyable ride all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast to the story, the animation is, at best, average. There isn't anything unique about the character or environment design that is worth mentioning. While I did particularly enjoy the sequences that featured Satou's dreams and delusions (seeing Misaki with various sharp objects as arms was probably one of my favourite moments of the series), there really aren't many opportunities to showcase any innovative animation because of the nature of the series. There are some occasional animation mishaps, but they aren't noticeable enough to affect the overall enjoyability, especially if you consider that the technical elements of the series were clearly not where the studio devoted most of its attention and effort. In addition, this is my first series by this particular animation studio, so it wouldn't be fair for me to compare the animation in Welcome to the NHK! to that of other Gonzo animes. \\n\\n\r\nI must say that I was thoroughly impressed with the seiyuu performances, especially considering the fact that the seiyuus of the two central characters (Satou and Misaki) are not at all high-profile and have had little experience with voice acting. Look them up on here if you don't believe me. They, in addition with the rest of the cast, put on an impressive performance that is almost never lacking in emotion or vigour.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack of the series, there is not much to say. None of the insert songs really caught my eye (or in this case, ear), but all of them did help establish an appropriate mood that corresponded to the atmosphere of the scenes. I didn't even find the supposedly addictive \"Purupuru Pururin\" theme song very catchy, but I suppose everyone has different musical tastes.  \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the version of the series I watched had all the opening and ending sequences omitted, and I am far too lazy to go out of my way to watch and critique them.  Why go into such meaningless details when the story itself is so superb? \\n\\n\r\nFor a series that lasts a lengthy 24 episodes, Welcome to the NHK! doesn't really present us with a diverse collection of characters. There were very few side characters as well, something that may seem unsual to some anime watchers. While series with numerous main characters have been proven to work under the right circumstances (Fate/Zero and Baccano! are great examples), Welcome to the NHK!'s modest cast allows for a greater degree of depth that ultimately leads to the creation of three-dimensional, true-to-life characters with relatable sentiments and motivations. \\n\\n\r\nThe first character who I will discuss in detail is Satou Tatsuhiro, the protagonist of the story. Satou fits the description of a hikkomori perfectly. He is anti-social to the extent that he rarely leaves his apartment because he feels uncomfortable around other people. Even in his high school days, the only person with whom he interacts on a regular basis is his senpai. He is shown to have a cynical but apathetic outlook on life and people in general, and his inability to adapt and change himself is ultimately what causes him to venture further and further down the path of social alienation. When he finally does realize that he needs to do something about his life, he is unable to accept it emotionally, which leads him to indulge in various other anti-social activities, forming the basis for most of the story. Satou also finds it impossible to relate to anybody else in the world besides his senpai, as demonstrated by the delusional sequences where he ventures outside, only to be ridiculed by the people (and even animals) on the streets. The 'beauty' of Satou's character is that the mannerisms he exhibits are not at all unfamilar to us young adults growing up in the twenty-first century. It goes without saying that some of us will be able to see a bit of ourselves in Satou. Forgive me if I am making unjustified assumptions, but I guarantee that all of us have, at some point during our lives, wondered about our true purpose in this vast universe. I am sure we have all gone through a stage during which we hated the world because we believed no one understood us. Satou's thoughts and actions may be, for the most part, portrayed in an exaggerated fashion, but his character, along with his struggles, shed some light on the problems we face in our everyday lives, as much as we may be unwilling to admit it. \\n\\n\r\nWhile Satou is clearly the star of the show with his adorably quirky character and mannerisms, another character manages to steal the spotlight from him on numerous occasions. Her name is Misaki Nakahara, and she is a mysterious girl who seems to know more about Satou than he would be comfortable sharing with anybody other than his senpai. Yet she maintains an enigmatic personality throughout the series and doesn't tell him anything about her own past. She claims to be able to help Satou escape from his social isolation, and her idealistic nature is something that sets her apart from most of the characters in the series. The two begin a valuable relationship, and it becomes clear that she develops romantic feelings for him over time. She even goes so far as to personally take care of him and make meals for him when his parents cut off his allowance. Morever, the only thing she expects from him is recognition. On the surface, she seems like every guy's perfect girl - a girl with truly pure intentions who probably does not exist in the real world. If she were truly as perfect as she seems, I honestly wouldn't be able to like her as much as I do. Thankfully, she isn't perfect at all. Forgive me for spoiling the story a bit, but the reason why she was intially willing to help Satou is that she pities him. It would be an understatement to say that she's had a rough past, and it pleases her to know that there's someone who is worse off than her. As altruistic as she appears, she is truly selfish in nature because she offers him a helping hand for the sake of making herself feel better.  \\n\\n\r\nI must also say that I quite enjoyed Kaoru Yamazaki's character as well. Like Satou, he is also rather socially isolated, and he indulges himself with anime and eroge games. But while his extremely obsessive and perverted nature, if exhibited in an indivual in the real world, is enough to make anyone cringe in disgust, he is ultimately a respectable character with realistic aspirations who, unfotunately, falls victim to the many distractions present in today's society.\\n\\n\r\nUpon finishing the series, it is easy to see that Welcome to the NHK! boasts some of the most well-developed, realistic, and memorable characters in the history of anime, adding to the overall value of an already remarkable and original series.  \\n\\n\r\nI want to thank all of you who actually took the time to read through this review. If you still aren't convinced that watching Welcome the the NHK! would be an efficient way to spend 8 hours of your life, I honestly have nothing more to say. Welcome to the NHK! is an absolute MUST-watch for any college-aged anime fan. You NEED to watch it in order to understand the sheer potential of this form of media. Who knows? It might even end up changing your life. \\n\\n\r\nI think the best way to conclude this review is to discuss the ending of the anime. I have heard many complaints about how the series didn't have the clich\u00e9 \"happily ever after\" ending. As much as I would have enjoyed a happy ending, it simply does not fit with the message that the writers were trying to convey. There are rarely any happy endings in reality, because life is a constant struggle. In each stage of our lives, we are faced with challenge after challenge, and it is only those who have the strength to carry on that are ultimately able to find their happy endings. \\n",

            "content": "\"The journey is more important than the destination.\"\r\nStory: 8.5/10\r\nNHK delves deep into the mind of a reclusive 22-year-old called Tatsuhiro Satou. Poor Satou has no friends, no money aside from the allowance his parents give him, has dropped out of the university he was attending and doesn't appear to have any future. By the time the story gets going, he's already spent three years living the life of a recluse, only going out at night (when there are few people around) to fetch food.\r\nThe anime gets going with a bizarre dream sequence where the word 'conspiracy' gets thrown around a lot. Then, even more bizarrely,another dream like sequence occurs shortly afterwards, showing his household appliances speaking to him, voicing the negative thoughts that lurk in the back of his mind. These dreams/visualizations are far from unusual in NHK - they're used to show the world from the colourful viewpoint of Satou, and they do an excellent job of doing so, if I do say so myself. You get a clear view of Satou's imagination early on when he imagines a character in a nun outfit doing... an unholy thing with her hand.\\n\\n\r\nSatou believes there's some sort of conspiracy against him; a conspiracy that's made him into the recluse he is. He picked this up from his weird, overly-medicated high school friend, taking her views as his own once his life started to really go down south. Whenever something bad happens, he blames those conspiring against him in the shadows, and whenever anything good happens he wonders if it's too good to be true.  It's easier to blame someone or something else for your failings, and that's exactly what Satou does.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully (for him), however, things start turning around after a 17/18-year-old girl called Misaki Nakahara takes an interest in him, deciding to turn him into her project. She writes down an agreement she created to supposedly help cure him, gets him to sign it and sees him for counseling sessions every evening. Of course, it's totally unbelievable that an attractive 17/18-year-old would decide to help a 22-year-old loser, but there's more to her than meets the eye...\\n\r\nThings start to improve further once he gets to know his neighbour; an old otaku acquaintance called Kaoru Yamazaki. The two quickly become friendly and Satou is pulled into the world of anime - he's taken to buy anime goodies, he's taken to a maid cafe and he even attempts to create an eroge (erotic) game. Oddly, it's thanks to anime and pornography that Satou starts to take his first steps towards recovery!!!\\n\\n\r\nAfter reading the above, you might be thinking that NHK is an overly depressing series, what with the lead being a recluse and all, but that's not really the case - it actually has more in the way of comedy than tears. With Satou having an otaku as his best friend, the comedy flows as he enters the world of erotic games, hentai/doujins and general anime madness. And even the serious, more meaningful parts of the story can be hilarious: for example, a suicide plan is amusing due to the character involved getting involved unwittingly, ending up almost getting pushed over the edge (verbally) by the person who is supposed to be stopping him. It's the sort of show where, at times, the serious parts are highly amusing. \\n\\n\r\nBut, having said the above, there's one thing NHK managed to do that very few stories ever accomplish: it got an emotional reaction out of me. I'm a little unsure exactly why such a simple thing made me teary-eyed but...\\n\\n\r\n(SPOILERS)...Satou not expressing his feelings for high school senpai, allowing her to drive off in episode 14, made me want to cry. I thought Satou was going to put right the wrongs of his past by confessing to her after he found the determination to attempt to do so, but all he actually ended up doing was going on a suicide trip and not saying a word against it. Ever since the early flashback sequences I wanted to see the two get together in the end, so to see their relationship end without even a discussion about their feelings made me very frustrated. So close yet so far - that pretty much sums up their relationship.(SPOILERS END)\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, back on track. The reason I've scored a story that touches upon so many disturbing aspects of life so well only 9/10 is because of some fairly bothersome flaws that effected my enjoyment. The main problem I have is with five episodes that add nothing to the story and could be removed without the story suffering, those episodes being 15-19. I was fully prepared to rate the series 10/10 and put it in my top five after going through episodes 1-14, but I changed my mind after those episodes took the focus away from what's most important - the development of the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nHere are my more detailed thoughts about those episodes:\\n\\n\r\n(SPOILERS) Episodes 15-16 focus on a MMORPG story where Satou becomes addicted to playing one and ends up not going out at all. I liked the disturbing vision of what a 50 year old Satou would look like if he went down the road he planned on walking down, and the trick Yamazaki played on Satou was an excellent way of teaching him the harsh reality of internet interactions. But I found myself wondering what the point of these episodes was when there had already been a similar story about Tatsuhiro becoming glued to his PC (on that occasion, porn was his addiction). It was also bothersome how poorly the MMORPG gameplay was depicted; it was way too basic to be realistic.\\n\\n\r\nAfter episode 16, the series moved onto another pointless story, this one being about poor Satou getting scammed by an old high school acquaintance. The new character involved in this arc was no more than a filler character really - she appeared very briefly in one of Satou's school flashbacks, reappeared for these episodes and then disappeared from the story. Her character, like the 3 episode story she featured in, served no purpose other than raising the episode count. And the end of the scam story was rather silly, with the younger brother of the new character randomly recovering from a level of reclusion higher than that of Satou after hunger made him go out to get food. (SPOILERS END)\\n\\n\r\nIf you skipped episodes 15-19 then you wouldn't be missing out on anything important, and that's my issue with these episodes. The story flows much better without those episodes included.\\n\\n\r\nMy other issue with the story is the inconclusive ending that resolved far too little. I questioned the point of it all after I'd finished watching a series where not a lot changed from beginning to end, and I came to the conclusion that what's most important about the NHK story is the experiences the characters go through and not the end results of those experiences.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are easily the best aspect of NHK. There are four key characters:  Tatsuhiro Satou, Misaki Nakahara, Kaoru Yamazaki and Hitomi Kashiwa. The others who feature don't appear in many of the episodes and aren't really worth mentioning. NHK clearly benefited from the focus not constantly switching to secondary characters. It's a shame that certain other series don't have as few important characters and ultimately suffer because of them having an excessive amount of under-developed characters.\\n\\n\r\nSatou is the lead character. At the start of NHK, he's become afraid of people due to the small amount of encounters he's had with them in the three years prior to the NHK story starting, and he blames everything that's gone wrong in his life on some sort of conspiracy. The series focuses on him as he slowly improves and starts to make friends after Misaki decides to cure him. As you'd expect, he develops a fair bit over the course of the series, although I'm not quite happy with how much he improves from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nMisaki, the 17/18-year-old girl who attempts to lift Satou from the darkness he's found himself in at the start of the story (she's the first character that interacts with him), has clearly had bad things happen to her in the past, which ultimately lead her to wanting to help Satou for her own reasons. Satou wonders if she's an angel sent to save him at first, but his troubled mind also wonders about the possibility of her being an agent sent by the organization he believes to be conspiring against him...\\n\\n\r\nHitomi (Satou's high school senpai), who constantly expresses her belief that everything going wrong is the result of a conspiracy, gets shown early on in numerous interesting flashbacks of her school days with Satou, and she also plays a fairly important role in the story. She's the sort of person who hides her feelings behind a mask of seriousness, only letting her guard down when she's had a little too much to drink or had something bad happen to her, and that made the few occasions where her mask was removed stay in my memory. Hitomi is my favourite character, mainly due to her looks (I am male!!!), but also because she and Satou would've been a great couple had Satou not been such a wimp.\\n\\n\r\nYamazaki, the otaku of the series, has suffered from bullying and rejection, and he gets shown a lot due to him being the first friend (Misaki aside) of the reclusive lead (from the start of the story, that is). He has a bad temper and big mouth, which is what lead to a lot of the bullying he's received. Yamazki is the character that gives the lead a goal to work towards as he offers Satou the chance to create the story of an erotic video game, and the two then spend most of the series working on it together.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the main cast are likeable, all of them are interesting and, most importantly, all of them have depth. It's rare to see realistic characters in anime, and it's hard not to view the main four as realistic when you see all the hardships they go through. NHK isn't the sort of series where happy things happen to prevent the story from scaring viewers away, so it's only right that characters that play prominent roles aren't lucky enough to see effort always be rewarded.\\n\\n\r\nWhat prevents me from giving the characters top marks is the inconclusive ending to the stories of Satou and Misaki. If some sort of hint had been given about what happens to them in the future, then I would've been happy, but the series ended without Tatsuhiro having improved a huge amount and with the relationship of the two being unclear. I'm hoping the manga and/or novel provides a more satisfying conclusion...\\n\\n\r\nArt / Animation: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI'll admit it: I'm far from an observant person and have an awful memory. I don't take in minor visual details, nor do I see minor art/animation issues. Unless an anime looks either visually amazing or horrific I don't have a lot to say.\\n\\n\r\nI do happen to have something to say about the animation of NHK, and it isn't good. For the most part I was happy with the animation of NHK; it's a non-action series, meaning I'm fine as long as the animation flows without issue. Sadly, one episode of NHK (19) had some of the worst animation I've seen from one of the more recent series, the animation being so bad that panning shots were jerky, as if there was less than 8 FPS. I actually wondered if my graphic card had finally decided it didn't want to be used for any more anime viewing, but it turned out that Gonzo had actually released an episode with some of the worst animation ever. I now see why Gonzo aren't the most popular animation studio around...\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, I was happy with it, with only the poor art in episode 19 catching my eyes. I have seen other viewers complain a little about the art, so it's possible that those more observant than myself have seen lots of things I haven't, but all I can say is that very little stood out as poor. If you're like me (I feel for you!) then I promise you won't go into an internet rage over the artwork.\\n\\n\r\nBright colours were used by Gonzo instead of gloomy ones, which was a smart thing for them to do when NHK has a lot of comedy. The colours are eye-catching and pleased me. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending animations are a little...different. The OP is great, playing out like a stylish dream sequence of sorts, and it fits well with the song, which is called 'Puzzle'. During the opening Misaki is seen with a puzzle piece, representing the missing piece of Satou, and it obviously fits in well with the song.\\n\r\nThe first ending animation defines crazy: it shows the tiny, imaginary alien creatures that Tatsuhiro sees dancing around (including shaking their arse!). I'm not sure what to say about it really; it's something you just have to see for yourself. The second ending animation is more on the normal side, but it's also completely forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music didn't blow me away for the most part, but there are a few songs that have stuck in my memory, one being a vocal song about loneliness that played during episode 14 - perfect for the scene it played during. There was also a decent range of non-vocal music, one guitar theme that played during the more depressing scenes being quite memorable. Overall, the soundtrack fitted well with the story, didn't distract and was pleasing to my ears.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was up to the usual high Japanese standard. It's hard for me to say much when it's very rare I have issues with Japanese voice acting, and this was no exception. When I have something interesting to add it'll be when a voice annoys me to the point I feel the need to moan, but until then...\\n\\n\r\nI'm very fond of the first opening theme; I've watched the opening animation quite a bit just to listen to it. It doesn't really sound like it fits in the series content a lot of the time since it sounds a little too uplifting, but the quality of it makes me ignore that. The first ending theme goes brilliantly with the insanity of the dancing alien animation - like I said before, you have to watch to understand. The second ending theme, like the animation, wasn't memorable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf the quality had been as a consistent throughout the series as it was during the first 14 episodes, I'd be giving it 10/10. But, as it stands, I can't bring myself to give top marks to a series with five disappointing episodes and an inconclusive ending.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I enjoyed the ride a lot, watching all 24 episodes in 48-72 hours. I'll be buying both the manga and novel at some point, and also the anime itself. I can't recommend the series enough to those looking for an escape from the usual kiddy rubbish that plagues anime and/or those looking for an anime superior to Genshiken in the battle of the otaku anime representations. But, really, every anime fan should watch this at least once.",

            "content": "Spoiler free review!\r\n\u2727 Introduction/the story:\r\nWhat is it like to be a hikikomori? Or an otaku? Are they lazy or weird just because, or is there a deeper reason behind their behaviour? Do they have some mental disorder? Then what are the situations a person with mental illnesses have to go through? If you ever wondered about one of these questions, Welcome to the NHK is the perfect answer.\r\n\u2727 The characters:\r\nThe main cast is amazingly handled and very well fleshed out. Despite representing a group of people, they are far from being bland or just stereotypes, they are charismatic, multi-faceted and you get to know themmore and more with every episode. They have their virtues, their defects, their goals and what they think about other people and what they want to do with their lives.\\n\\n\r\nTheir attitudes, actions and personalities are justified and explored. The story emphasizes on why they are like that and why they act like that. They all have serious problems and it's very possible you could identify with them; we even get to know the most horrible and messed up side of them. This is what makes them human and the series really makes you care about them. \\n\\n\r\nSatou, the main character, is easily the best written of them all. We basically see the life through the view of a paranoid, anxious person; we get to know his past and his relationships with other characters in-depth and with proper pacing. His character is so well developed and constructed that at some point he gets to becomes totally unpredictable to the viewer.\\n\\n\r\n\u2727 The script:\\n\r\nFirst of all, this story deals with realistic situations and it shows you how being a hikikomori or an otaku genuinely is. Because of this the story gets more and more depressing and psychological as it advances, bit by bit you get to know that the main cast of characters have mental illnesses, existential emptiness, how they try to fill it and how reality hits them hard constantly without recurring to victimization or shock value. Rather, trying to show valuable lessons through them, implementing the use of smart and thought provoking visual metaphors and outstanding dialogue, especially when the MC is talking to himself. \\n\\n\r\nNHK is a dark comedy that presents a very good transition between the funny moments and the darker side of it. Sometimes they even complement each other, enriching the plot, but this doesn't mean that you'll get misplaced wacky comedy when the story is handling its more serious facet. It amazingly deals with stuff such as self-hatred, having no will to live and trying to find one, feeling alone and useless, recurring to escapism, being stigmatized, emotional dependence, cursing others because of your own misery, obsession, using others for your own enjoyment and being easily fooled by the smallest sign of affection.\\n\\n\r\nThis show has some fan service, but most of the time it's there to make a point about the characters and their psyches, especially exploring the MC's mind and sometimes even in a way that might make you feel a bit uncomfortable, because it's there to show you a reality. Not only to make you grope for it. \\n\\n\r\n\u2727 Production values:\\n\r\nThe animation is far from perfect, but the setting is well constructed and it's perfect for the tone of the story, like a mix between the funny stuff and the serious themes the story has. Don't forget that this is a dramedy, so a setting with an ambiguous feeling is just right.\\n\\n\r\nThe expressive seiyuus fit the characters perfectly, the soundtrack isn't amazing but still very memorable, the contrast between the first opening and ending is basically telling you how the show is going to be. Be careful with Pururin's opening song, it's too catchy!\\n\\n\r\n\u2727 Conclusion:\\n\r\nWelcome to the NHK is excellent. It deals with complex themes and mental illnesses with mature, realistic situations and greatly fleshed out characters with real problem. The animation and art style are not amazing but I really recommend you give it a try, especially if you have or had depression, paranoia, anxiety or wanted to commit suicide sometime in your life. Although you don't necessarily need to be a hikikomori or an otaku to feel identified with the characters.",

            "content": "If you're searching for a great slice of life, then you're in the right place. Welcome to the NHK is a big delicious ice cream when it comes to showing everyday tasks of an adult being sociophobic. The main character, Sato is a 22 year old young man who wasn't prepared for growing up and becoming self independent. The series shows him struggling with himself and how he is brought up back by Misaki, a girl who signs a contract with Sato to help him overcome sociophobia. \r\nThe Story is life sucking. I marathoned this series in 3 days, just because i was so interestedto see what Sato is gonna face up next. Its about things we encounter a lot these days, like suicide. But without spoiling, i'll say that its very relatable for some.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is not so pleasing however. Some might hate it, but i was so interested in the story, that the art played a very tiny role for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound on the other hand is just perfectly placed. It was fitting in every moment when Sato was feeling lost or alone.\\n\\n\r\nThe Character of Yamazaki, Sato's neighbor, was very funny, i believe he is the one that could cause this anime be considered in a way a comedy, but in fact its far from that. Misaki is Sato's dream girl, but they never actually get to be together unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is slice of life in its best way possible. I enjoyed the hell out of Sato's life and this is an important anime to me because i have made some important life lessons since then.",

            "content": "Ever felt that life was so hard, that you just wanted to escape from it?\r\n\"Welcome to NHK\" is truly a \"revolution\" in it itself. It is like the \"revolution,\" that Sato mentions when he goes to the isolated island.\r\nAlthough it's a fictional masterpiece, it is highly relevant to our lives and today's society. It presents an enormous range of social issues, that is not just found in Japan. Are you interested in people who are addicted to mmorpgs? Well then, you got it! Not to mention, you can sense that the author of the anime intended to critcize society.\r\nLet's be blunt. Sato is a Hikikomori.According to the Ministry of Health, a Hikikomori is a person who does not go to school for at least 6 months and does not work for 6 months. Instead, a Hikikomori would devote most of his or her time to a single pursuit, such as a hobby. You might find him unrealistic, but to say the very least, he is an extreme example of what society can do to a person.\\n\\n\r\nReality is harsh and we can all imagine being in Sato's position, devoid of much hope and feeling outcasted.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a Hikikomori, Sato becomes isolated and scared of what life outside really is. \\n\r\nAlong the way, he meets complex individuals who try to cheer him up, the benevolent and loveable Misaki-chan and the friendly otaku, Yamazaki.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are really thought-provoking and definitely the center piece of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEach and every character in this anime has a story to tell. At one point you might hate a character, but only to realise that their actions aren't that shallow. For instance, Megumi attempts to trick Sato twice. However, we learn that Megumi, herself, is in a pickle.\\n\\n\r\nMy favorite character of this anime is definitely Misaki. But, she herself is not perfect. Like every character in this anime, she faces problems of her own. Who is she? Who is god? Why is god so mean to her? It leaves, us the audience, wondering if there is any hope, when even the savior of Sato is not even flawless as she initially appears.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is not intended to represent today's modern anime. That is, it's not incredibly ecchi or overtly flashy. I liked that the illustrators tried to make the characters realistic. You have the standard real life palette of hair colors. If you were expecting characters with odd hair colors (think green), with the exclusion of Puripuri, then don't look here.\\n\\n\r\nJust before you think that this anime is an emotional train wreck or something. That's not true at all. At times, the humor is vivid and provocative. You will definitely LoL at times.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is really a great tale of life and it's nuisances. It's impeccably written and directed. I've never laughed so hard nor felt so much sorrow. You can say my limbic system was very stimulated at times. You can't miss this. Period.",

            "content": "Welcome to the NHK was an interesting experience for me, I didn't know what to expect from the show while diving into it, so it's not like I set my expectation high but I was still really disappointed by it, for a number of reasons that I will explain in this review.\r\nThe Story. It's about a NEET & Hiki named Satou and his crazy depressing life with several other characters. It was more or less a social commentary about a serious issue in modern society with a black comedy tone. The story was incoherent, at times it was about Satou and his problems and howhe wants to deal with them and help himself but it shifts that focus through out the story, making it feel like Satou's problems are just delayed. It focuses on the wrong characters and dedicate arcs for them which don't contribute a lot to the overall plot progression or to Satou's character. One of the arcs is really just terrible and it just contradicts any kind of logic the show has. I'm talking about the arc that focused on Megumi and her brother, that was simply just stupid. It showed how bad her situation with her brother is in and how Hikikomoris affect their family life and not just their own, it also introduced online gaming addiction and how it can worsen the life of a NEET but all of that doesn't matter if he, the brother just miraculously recovers from his severe social anxiety thanks to hunger, HUNGER?! that was so unrealistic in so many levels. We have Satou who by far have it better than Megumi's brother but still can't get his life together. I felt like that betrayed the message of the show and how hard it is to recover from being a NEET and a Hikikomori.\\n\\n\r\nThey also censored/removed Satou's usage of drugs which explains why he had those hallucinations. He didn't have them because he was so mentally unstable or obsessed with conspiracies like the anime portrayed. It was him just using some drugs, no one gets that mentally unstable from just being a NEET and a Hikikmori. The story ended on an open ending which I didn't like at all, having a conclusive ending would have been much better. It would have showed that going through all this, meant something.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters. They are flawed human beings and this is what story was trying to show, that made them feel real but in certain situations they felt like the complete opposite of real. Example of this would be Satou and his relationship with Misaki and his Senpai, especially Senpai. Satou is supposed to be a pathetic, spineless and an unstable human being but I still find the way he acted in the Suicide Island arc to be highly unrealistic and stupid. He didn't want to die but still went along with it and tried to convince himself that it was okay if he died and he would at least die with his precious Senpai. The anime left a detail that could have helped explain his relationship with Senpai and that was the fact that he lost his virginity to her, I feel like that would have made the fact that he just followed her around and didn't get mad at her for anything, much more believable.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationships of the characters didn't get properly developed, Misaki who is supposed to be a main character get sidetracked to focus on other stuff, her relationship with Satou felt really under-developed and iffy. I would have loved to seem them further exploring the psychologically coherent and smart approach of two psychically wounded people healing each other through social interaction and an affectionate relationship. However, they completely dropped the idea somewhere in the middle of the story. Instead we got to see other crazy people and their problems while Misaki turned slowly into a side character. Satou who was head over heels suddenly treated her indifferent, the way he treated her through the story was inconsistent. At the end they didn't go anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nThe art & animation: The art was decent, the animation however was for the most part bad and inconsistent due to low budget probably.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. Did I enjoy this show?! it's hard to tell, on one hand I did like the comedy on the other hand I didn't like the execution of the story and characters. And I can't really relate to the main character like some people do since I'm not a NEET or a Hikikmmori.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would recommend to watch this if you feel like watching something that showcase a real issue on modern society and how scary it is but I really wouldn't recommend watching this if you are looking for a psychological anime with great characters or a well developed bitter-sweet love story",

            "content": "Based on a novel, Welcome to the NHK delves deeply into the life of Tatsuhiro Satou, a troubled hikikomori and NEET obsessed with thoughts of conspiracy and distrust. In telling the story of a hikikomori, this series brings to light in anime aspects of Japanese society that are both real and prevalent. We come to see the world through Satou\u2019s eyes, as he meets the mysterious Misaki Nakahara, a young girl claiming to be able to cure him of his antisocial ways. It is from here that his journey begins.\r\nThe series tactfully incorporates a certain dark humor with deeply emotional and psychologically driven characters withwhom viewers quickly empathize. Satou\u2019s path beyond his life as a hikikomori is a colorful one certain to entertain, and offer viewers a distinct insight into Japanese subcultures and trends.\\n\\n\r\nTatsuhiro Satou is an understandably complex character, who\u2019s struggles are depicted along various levels. However, the series does well to integrate into the story the difficulties and psychological stresses of those individuals that Satou interacts with, as he attempts the transition from social withdrawal, and how they fit into the jigsaw that has become his life. Apart from Misaki, other principle characters include figures from Satou\u2019s past, Kaoru Yamazaki, his former high school junior, and an otaku of the highest order, and Hitomi Kashiwa, his high school senpai. We find very quickly that both come to add much diversity and transformation to Satou\u2019s life in their own unique ways.\\n\\n\r\nThe character design of the series is particularly well-formed, neither parody nor overly realistic. Characters maintain real-world features, drawn at thin lined with angular features. Certain attention is paid to background art and the characters\u2019 world, at times incorporating different animation styles in different episodes to emphasize the characters\u2019 situations and experiences.\\n\\n\r\nThe series\u2019 soundtrack closely blends with the scene actions, and appropriately lays accent to the characters\u2019 interactions and emotions. In an episode, we may come across points of soft background music to faster and louder rock beats, and even silence when appropriate. The opening and ending sequences are just as dichotomous, their variances in tone matching the protagonist\u2019s unbalanced, but intriguing attitude and views.\\n\\n\r\nWelcome to the NHK follows a series of story arcs, some of which are certainly more entertaining than others. It is obviously met with its lulled points, but these are largely surpassed by its high points. And regardless, it seems each turn aids in some way in developing the characters\u2019 throughout the story. One finds oneself connecting with the characters on varied levels as the series progresses, and ultimately, find satisfaction and enjoyment in its viewing.",

            "content": "Anime has often been used as a means of exploring new worlds, immersing yourself for just a moment to watch a story unfold somewhere wildly different from reality. There\u2019s no harm with that at all and it can be a blast. I\u2019ve often found however that I get most enjoyment from shows that tackle meaningful topics in a more realistic setting. Welcome to the N.H.K delivers on this in spades. The show\u2019s themes of depression, anxiety and social withdrawal are treated with respect and attention to detail. It had me interested from episode one through to its superb conclusion. It\u2019s a show that I wouldn\u2019thesitate a moment to award a \u2018must watch\u2019 tag to.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nWelcome to the N.H.K. sees us following the story of Tatsuhiro Satou. He\u2019s a \u2018hikikomori\u2019 (socially withdrawn individual), a term for one who is often shunned by Japanese society for their lack of desire to contribute to the workforce and behave in a socially acceptable manner. In strolls Misaki Nakahara to his life to offer help in getting his life back on track and so the journey begins.\\n\\n\r\nIn the time we\u2019re exposed to Satou we see him learn about seemingly easy methods to get out of his poor state of being, failing to put Misaki\u2019s more thought-out efforts to use. He instead believes the evil \u2018N.H.K\u2019 organisation have made him part of a plan to make other citizens feel better about themselves \u2013 by not being him. Part of the appeal of the show is seeing Satou\u2019s view of society clash with the real world as he becomes exposed to more of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story gives off one strong message: Not everything you undertake brings rewards and sometimes the fruits of your labour come off with a sour taste compared to the sweet one you expected. Watching Satou bounce between not caring what happens and suddenly gaining motivation is intentionally frustrating and well done story telling. The writers know that this isn\u2019t an issue that has a blanket solution. The show takes time to establish Satou\u2019s situation, making us see every detail of what he does and what he believes in. Because of that we appreciate even the tiniest of steps he takes on an attempted road to recovery.\\n\\n\r\nThe story structure is one of just a few gripes of mine. I liked the build-up over the initial seven to eight episodes but then the show starts to jump between different scenarios quite frequently. One particularly dramatic arc seems to come from nowhere but it is does still serve a purpose. It provides one of the most critical moments for Satou to reflect on how good he might actually be off compared to others. In a way you could see storytelling change up as a form of Satou\u2019s increasing desperation to seek an escape from his hikikomori lifestyle. The pace at least picks up in a way that mirrors that, though it took me a moment to get used to. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nSatou is one of the most realistic and strongest characters I\u2019ve seen in this medium, and that\u2019s not a piece of praise I hand out every day. Just when Satou looks like he\u2019s making progress you can see his frightened mental state pull him back. When he makes a significant achievement it feels huge because his weaknesses are laid out in all their harsh truth for the viewer to see. It\u2019s easy to both despite Satou yet want to cheer him on. He cheats, lies and avoids situations because he feels so bad about his place in the world. It\u2019s not like he doesn\u2019t learn from experiences though, and on occasions you won\u2019t even notice the small steps he takes in his attempt to better himself. He\u2019s cleverly written, feels terrifyingly real and everyone can relate to him in some way or another. I\u2019ve often heard that those who get the most out of the show are those who are living a life like Satou\u2019s. I can see how that may be but even so I took plenty away from its ideas despite sharing little in common. There\u2019s ideas of diverging paths and disconnection with friends over time that really struck a chord with me. This isn\u2019t a show just made to inspire those in the same situation. Welcome to the N.H.K. uses Satou to express universal ideas of solitude, deceit and addiction. Everyone has experienced that in some form.\\n\\n\r\nMisaki is one of the more mysterious characters whose purpose and background are deliberately handed over to the viewer at only a snail\u2019s pace. I loved the way the show was self-aware about Misaki\u2019s own place in the narrative (a girl with no ill feeling towards the main character who comes to \u2018save\u2019 him) and had Satou challenge that concept. This naturally creates friction between the pair and only as Satou feels more confident in himself does this ease somewhat. Despite her simple appearance, conversational tone and easy-going nature, you are always left to wonder what\u2019s driving Misaki forward. Because of that, Misaki\u2019s moments in the final run of episodes are incredible. Seeing that mystery behind her character unravelled is such a rewarding experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast is strong with Kaoru Yamazaki a big stand out. He\u2019s the one who first drags Satou on a different path and his otaku lifestyle starts to rub off on Satou, for better and worse. He acts like a picture of sensibility to Satou yet at the same time is far from a perfect man himself. In fact, in this show, no-one is. Everyone has a gigantic flaw or a big hole they\u2019ve dug themselves, and most of them don\u2019t want to admit it. This a show based on people putting on a different face to cover for their insecurities, but slowly coming to terms with their psychological problems and shedding that fa\u00e7ade. It isn\u2019t torn down through melodrama or unrealistic circumstances either. You feel that every shot and every character has an important purpose to being there.\\n\\n\r\nSound & Art\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I didn\u2019t expect this show to deliver so strongly on was the soundtrack. I was blown away by the lovely melancholic guitar melodies and the softly sung vocals. Despite its simple chord structure \u201cYoukoso Hitori Bocchi\u201d has become one of my most memorable anime tracks thanks to its well delivered vocals, a song that has the amazing ability to sound both depressing and uplifting at the same time. There\u2019s a lazy, mellow vibe that comes from this soundtrack that perfectly encapsulates the sense of wanting to drift along with minimal effort \u2013 quite appropriate.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s remarkable to see how underutilised Satou\u2019s voice actor Yutaka Koizumi has been in the industry because his performance in Welcome to the N.H.K. is nothing short of fantastic. Whether it be the screams of anger, his strangely menacing cackle or just his everyday musings, everything is spot on. The snarky tones of Yamazaki\u2019s voice actor Daisuke Sakaguchi (Satoshi Fukube of Hyouka and Shinpachi Shimura of Gintama) are another standout and make for both excellent banter and chemistry between the two characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this show is certainly nothing amazing but rarely detracts from the experience. Characters are very crudely drawn at moments plus there\u2019s some hilariously overdone shading at times. Thankfully the show is exactly reliant on scenes that require a whole load of movement so the simplistic art style and the matching level of animation don\u2019t feel so bad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nThis show is designed to frustrate you, make you laugh, make you cry. It succeeds on every level. It may a little slow for some but I encourage you to take the time out to watch a show that actually explores some very serious ideas without sugar coating them or diluting them down with some irrelevant sub plot. Every shot and every scene has an important purpose. This show has stayed on my mind for some time after finishing it and I guarantee it will do the same for you.",

Personally loved the story sure it can be funny and have light hearted  moments but then dives into serious shit like suicide and depression so yes the story is amazing.\r\nArt I think the art of the show suits it very well every characteris very distinct and clear to their facial expressions to the designs themselves of course if you are picky about your fucking animation you may not like the characters designs art 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10 Alright the sound in this show is amazing the first opening is one of my favorite songs of all time and the Japanese voice actors did an amazing job did not like the English dub as they didn't take the show as seriously as they could have 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10 Here we get to the meat of the show the characters lets talk about saito shall we? saito is not a perfect character he has a lot of things wrong with him he has a flawed personality wants nothing to do with his life but thats what makes him so great. HE is meant to be like that the whole show revolves around him. As he gets better as a person or worse as a person at certain parts of the show also my 3rd  favourite anime character \\n\\n\r\nMisaki: Misaki is int resting any normal person would have given up on saito by now except she doesn't the reason why is very spolilerish so l will not ruin it for you sure she can be a bitch and manipulate saito and everything but every character has flaws another amazing character and my Favorite female character. \\n\\n\r\nYamazaki Saitos neighbor and an otaku now l dislike yamazaki the most out of the 3 main characters not cause l hate him he is a great character also him and saito have the most hilaerous moments especially with the porn and mmo he is also a serious character as well him having to go back to his hometown to be a farmer. Sorry for spoilers \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 The show is just flat outstanding it broke me free of my neet life style the message is never to give up hope in life as something may good come around you may not enjoy the show as much as me but eh please watch it\\n\\n\r\noverall 10/10  The show is an masterpiece and highly overlook definitely worth buying on amazon.",

            "content": "For starters, the relatively low rating I gave is mainly due to my high expectations. It wasn't what I expected.\r\n\"NHK ni Youkoso !\" is definitely not a traditional anime. The premise of the story is set somewhat high, and I, as of reading the synopsis, was more that interested to see what a Hikikomori's life is like, especially with the \"Conspiracy theory\" seasoning.\r\nThe anime kicks of really well, and I immediately adjusted to the fact that this it won't be a deep, psychological analysis of the state of being an introvert. The rhythm was much more light and comical. And then realized it's nothing likewhat I expected it to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is promising and different, but not satisfying. THEY COULD HAVE DONE MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. Half of the 24 episodes were pretty much dull and passable, the anime could have squeezed a better scoring if it was shorter. The over-diversification of the themes is sometimes welcomed, but most of the times not. The anime was conceived to be rich and smart, but it failed to be both. It was set to be real, but the story was definitely not convincing (more on the characters section). I would have cited some ridiculously unpleasant change of pace/theme/world, but I should keep this review spoiler-free.\\n\\n\r\nThe art department is mostly safe, although the quality of drawings swing throughout the episodes (For instance, the Game art was very dull. Some of the scenery was very unspectacular. Overdone fan-service ..), but it safely lands on a 8/10. Some drolly-drawn scenes actually saved some dull episodes. The character design is another highlight, although not surprisingly so (Satou's grey eyes basically, I liked the weird alien things, then the over-kawaii Misaki-chan that is though generic, well made).\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is another fine part of the anime, but definitely not a remarkable achievement. The guitar melodies in the touching scenes, the jazz always alarms of a coming \"private\" scene, the ringtone of Satou's phone will not get out of my mind any soon. The seiyus were definitely a good pick, hence the 8/10 in the sound category. Misaki-chan's voice is so cute :3\\n\\n\r\nNow to my least favorite thing about the anime : The characters.\\n\r\nI couldn't enjoy \"NHK ni Youkoso!\" even if I tried. The characters where darn annoying and universally stupid. The protagonist is very shallow and utterly oblivious. Yamazaki, the only good character there is, was used minimally and unstably, and some times very abusively (by making him do things that don't follow his starting profile). Misaki-chan was super cute and super paper-thin, and a hard slap to feminism's face (as of any other female character in this anime). The rest wasn't noticeable. \\n\r\nI should go back to the stupidity thing. Am I the only one to be surprised of how unbelievably stupid the characters were ? I mean come on ! I bet a seven years old can make the characters less predictable and more conscious.  I suffered while watching them missing the points over and over and over again. Depressingly lame.\\n\\n\r\nSo, as a matter of fact, I hardly enjoyed \"NHK ni Youkoso!\" because I expected better and I abhorred the fact they made all the characters 0-brain creatures with limited back-story (They tried to give them some of that, but they failed) and unjustifiable urges to do more stupid things. The story could have be a \"let's think\" one, but it was more \"I don't think I can watch the rest of this\" one. The last two episodes could have redeemed the overall mediocrity of the anime, but the ending was so bad I was I stopped at the before-last episode's credit (with him running and the song playing an all).\\n\\n\r\nA sorrowful 6/10.",

It's fine if the show fits a certain genre, but for such an emotional roller coaster this show is, it leaves you empty with no closure. \r\nIs it just me or do other people hate when a show leaves you so confused about what the whole outcome was in the first place? I would like to see them succeed and overcome their hardships, but by the end it leaves you exactly where it started. I don't really know if I enjoyed this show or not. I loved the start of this showbut nearing the end I was wanting more - it really felt like the story had just begun.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character has no progression at all and is straight up a horrible person. He falls deep into his own imagination and has no affection for anyone else. Yes, he is a hikikomori, but by the end of the show there is no growth for this character. The other characters are more interesting, I wish we got to see more of them. They genuinely have interesting stories and I was intrigued - wanting to know more about them\\n\\n\r\nThe story left so many unanswered plot holes, and the stupid irrelevant sub-plots that had no bearing basically took over the second half of the show. They are completely useless to the main story progression, so it leaves you wondering what the whole point of the second half of the show is. It could have easily finished at episode 13 and it still would have had a climactic ending.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know anything about writing reviews but I had to make one after watching this show. <:\\n\\n",

            "content": "I've read reviews regarding how good this series was so I figured that I would give it a try.\r\nWelcome to NHK is sort of a mixed bag. It has it's ups and downs. If you go into it expecting comedy, meaning straight in your face comedy, you might be dissappointed. Thats not to say that NHK isn't funny...it's just not funny all the time.\r\nStory: \r\nNHK deals with the main subject of: Hikikomori  [A social dissorder where a person shuts themselves away from society and remains in seclusion, mostly common in Japan] \r\nThe series focuses on Satou Tatsuhiro, the main character, and his hikikomori lifestyleand a girl, Misaki, who tries to help him out of that lifestyle. Like I said before this series has its ups and downs and the same applies to the story. The ending could have been better. I felt that there wasn't enough closure.\\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\nNHK is produced by Gonzo. And just like with every other anime gonzo produces the art greatly varies. The first episode features great animation, its clean and crisp. Later down the road the animation dips to the level of generic anime. Gonzo always makes an amizing looking first episode to draw viewers in and then they start to half-ass their animation. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nI liked the intro song...confused about the 1st ending. Its just wierd. The sound is mixed. sometimes they play the right song at the right time and sometimes they dont. Most of the time youll probably hear a harmonica. [Theres this catchy yet annoying song at the very first few episodes, I found myself singing the chorus every now and then.] One thing that stands out about the sound is Koizumi Yutaka's voice acting as Satou.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nThe characters are interesting. A few of them develop early on, but some characters you dont even meet until the second half of the series. And some show up for one episode and dont return until five episodes. I found myself wondering...\"what happened to that one girl/guy?\" All in all the series' main focus is Satou's relationship with Misaki and Yamazaki. I did wish that there was more development in Satou's and Misaki's relationship. That kind of made the series for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis series was enjoying but theres one thing that bothers me. Some episodes stood out as episodes that really drew me in only to find out that the next episode isnt as good. And some episodes where just plain stupid. I kind of wish that the creators where more consistent with their delivery.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nIts a great series. This is my first review. So if you didnt find any reason to watch after you've read my review here are somepointers:\\n\\n\r\n1. If youre an otaku, die hard or not, you should watch this.\\n\r\n2. If youre interested about social problems in Japan, watch this.\\n\r\n3. If you want to see a peek at real life in Japan, watch it. Its not about \\n\r\n    anime and happy girls loving for no reason\\n\r\n4. If youve experienced social seclusion yourself watch this...may or may not \\n\r\n     help you.\\n\r\n5. If youre into drama watch it.\\n\r\n6. If your like me and bored, watch it.\\n\r\n7. If your into Psychological stuff and viewing the world in general in a\\n\r\n    different way, watch it.",

            "content": "NHK Ni Youkoso is the most fascinating story I ever saw. The way it symbolizes everyday life problems x100 is really well done. The fact that it is such a realistic and hard story with no taboos for any perverted thoughts makes it difficult for a lot of people to watch. Cause most of them don\u2019t expect such things in an animated serie, at least if they don\u2019t know anime and the culture behind it that well. It basicly shocks a lot of people. Just know that before you watch it and if it isn\u2019t your genre to begin with I think you have noright to judge it. It is just the same as I don\u2019t like shoujo, what doesn\u2019t mean I am going to watch it and give it a 1 or something.\\n\\n\r\nBut lets finally start with the story. The basic is that a boy of 24 (Satou) never comes out his apartment anymore .He has become a hikikomori or a NEET (not in education, employment or training). First you simply see his life as hikikomori. Which can be very weird, but just keep in mind that he hasn't really came out of his apartment for more than 3 years and that it comes from a novel where he is addicted to drugs. If you have been introduced to that you will see the girl of the story Misaki that wants to help him with his problem And makes him her project to bring him back to society. But the way back isn't as simple as you would think it is.\\n\\n\r\nThe order in what happens is really unpredictable. I mean that when you think he is almost \"cured\" it can become worse than it ever was before. What makes it very interesting and never boring to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very good especially the end where every piece of the puzzle comes together. It really makes the wonderful characters, it was just the best end I ever saw. I can guarantee you when you\u2019ve watched this you will understand socially awkward people much better and you also will have changed the way you look at them.\\n\\n\r\nFor the rest it was a very depressive story filled with humor. As you probably already know this series don\u2019t has any taboos. The art wasn\u2019t anything special but it fits the story perfectly and the way they express emotions especially with the eyes is very well done. The music wasn\u2019t that special however the start and endings songs fits again perfect with the story. The enjoyment was superb as I already said I was never bored however the episodes between 17 and 19 are less good in my opinion it feels as a filler of the story to me.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are still reading I guess it sounded interesting enough to watch it or you already did. If it was that first option I would say make sure to check it out as quick as possible :).",

            "content": "Alright. I loved watching it. It is a one-of-a-kind anime which maybe comes closest qua atmosphere to Steins;Gate\r\nStory: A cute girl want to help a shut-in to get rid of his agoraphobia. Meanwhile, he tries to complete a game with his neighbour.\r\nThe shut in slowly progresses with both, sometimes having huge draw-backs.\r\nStill, there is something fishy about that girl.\r\nI figured out what the rest of the story would be at the end of the island arc and I knew exactly every step Misaki (I love that name) would take after that. I didn't expect it to be that predictable. Not only that: her behavior isnot part of the climax, it IS the climax. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the level marketing arc was predictable, unnecissary, and the characters seemed so incredibly dumb compaired to their behavior in the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nBut still: a 7/10 is nothing to be ashamed about\\n\\n\r\nArt: Yes. This is bad. Misaki is cute and stuff, but it is pretty boring. Not only that, there are also some extremely badly animated parts, especially at the end of the marketing arc and when they shop in Tokyo. How could this ever pass on tv and how didn't this ever get fixed for dvd? This is something they SHOULD be ashamed of. Still, the good scenes were generally not bad, but it is not good enough:\\n\r\n4\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI love their voices! Misaki sounds so cute! Yamazaki = shinpachi, and Satou also has an amazing voice. The intro was very addictive, the first one, at least. The second one was the guitar version, but I liked that one a little less because it just 'wasn't right' after the first one. Also, I loved the first ending. Kenji Ohtsuki (known from most sayonara zetsubou sensei openings) made one of the best endings ever. His rare raw voice is one of the best things to come out of my speakers, ever!\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nLike I said, the plot is completely about character development, which is done almost perfectly. Only the character development of one of the side characters was a little iffy, but if you take it as a whole... wow! It is almost done too good because I figured out the plot in no time because of this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nGreat jokes, fun until the end, good timing, great sounds. This all added up to a great enjoyment. Only the art was sometimes so bad that it really annoyed me until it became better.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI usually don't give a crap about the art, but it was especially bad this time. Still, I accuse the story of being too lacking at the end. This is why I don't give it a 9, but a\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nJust watch it. It is a legendary anime and a milestone in psychological anime.\\n\r\nIt is the last anime to breathe the 'paranoia agent', 'lain' and 'boogiepop' atmosphere and it is the bridge between the older psychological anime and the newer ones.",

            "content": "[DROPPED]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nI'm not a fan of talking about something i'm dropping, mainly because it's literally impossible to make a holistic ome review of a show or movie without actually completing it. That being said, I don't really see anything inherently wrong with dropping something if it simply doesn't grab your interest or maybe even loses your interest as you continue watching it. \r\nWelcome to the NHK isn't an aggressively bad piece of filmaking. In fact, i'd say that it has a lot of positives. However, it seems like a fairly decisive work. I feel as though the entire show changes and the changes that happen aren'tparticularly interesting. \\n\\n\r\nI don't want to make a habit out of writing a review about a show I didn't finish unless I have a decent amount to say about it.\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[The Start and the Change]\\n\\n\r\nMy attitude towards NHK wasn't always so... I don't know, exhausted. In fact, a few weeks ago when I began with this show I was completely in love with it! The first five episodes are genuinely entertaining, funny, satirical, and interesting. Following the life of a NEET who's pretty self-aware and willing to try improve is something that i haven't seen before. More importantly, the idea that this show wasn't painting this kind of shitty lifestyle as \"cool\" or \"special\" is also something I definitely haven't seen before in anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo many anime have a NEET protagonist who's this awesome, charming, interesting guy who has twelve girls wanting to ride his meat popsicle that I get completely sick of the entire trope. Just cause you don't do shit doesn't mean you are a special. In fact, 99% of the time you are just a waste of space who bums around thinking they are special and that's about it. \\n\\n\r\nSo with NHK I was surprised to see them do the opposite of glorifying this awful lifestyle. Their approach to it was refreshing enough, but the fascinating, semi-abstract imagery and use of dream-sequences to express interesting symbolism was something that I fully got invested in. The introduction of the other protagonist who, for all intents and purposes plays as \"The Pixie Dream Girl\", didn't even detract from my experience. \\n\\n\r\nAs I said, it was funny, witty, pretty, and engaging through and through.\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nSo Misaki, a young-ish girl who takes an interest in our protagonist starts out fine enough. They have these night meetings and slowly learn more about each other and well, the story is obvious from there. They are clearly going to get into each other. And while it wasn't exciting or interesting, the other parts that made this show continue to shine are the more satirical elements it wraps itself up in.\\n\\n\r\nA constant self-aware barrage of meta-humor and often funny jabs at the entire \"Otaku\" community is kind of refreshing. The other secondary that plays off our protagonist is Yamazaki who is infinitely more engaging than Misaki and fits with the overall overlap between NEET and anime-nerd. What's a funny turn of events is that our protagonists manifesting infatuation with anime actually helps him spread his wings and become more social, while also having hilarious side-effects as well. \\n\\n\r\nNot only that, the show had consistently solid animations with some pretty solid character designs. Every character felt unique while still being a more realistic approach to design. The dream sequences helped sell the kind of world we are peering into, however, the overall crippling loneliness didn't really come off as too prevalent within this show. I read up on the changes made for this show and unfortunately, from what I read, every change that was made to this show made it more consumer friendly. Especially the changes to the apparent drug-use within the manga that really didn't appear at all in the adaptation. This made for the trippy sequences being a hard, often cool looking but not necessarily believable, sell. \\n\\n\r\nThe B-Story, which involves these two characters trying to make something they pleasantly call a \"Gal Game\" is just great. It floats as the A-story for around six episodes before being taken over by the obvious romantic plot that eventually ends up ruining the show for me. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nSo lets talk about romance. This show likes having romance. Is it good at portraying romance though? No. We have these two nerdy characters fawn over girls and their antics are often played up to the point where it's funny, but when NHK makes the transition from being comedy-oriented to being drama-oriented is where the flaws start springing up. \\n\\n\r\nMisaki is, through and through, a Pixie Dream Girl. A Pixie Dream Girl is a fairly common character archetype and trope in both anime and western film/television. These characters are often eccentric, cute girls that meet the character and carry them along on all sorts of adventures, teaching them a thing or two and overall helping them develop. While i'm generally very unfazed by this trope, it does have a lot of character beats that are fairly obvious. For example, a traumatic past, or a sprouting infatuation with the main character. \\n\\n\r\nIn NHK they really do nothing to alter that. Everything is played straight with Misaki and her role as a \"girl of mystery\" soon fades and she gains a new role, the \"I hope this scene is short cause it's boring\", role. Which really isn't too good to have. All the romance between her and the MC is so blunt and cliche that it's like i'm watching a completely different show. \\n\\n\r\nThe \"two characters lean in to kiss in a moment of passion but get interrupted by something zany\" actually happens... While this may not be a big deal to some, I want to re-iterate, this show, for the majority of its early episodes, poked hella fun at just about every trope and archetype known in anime. So the fact that they went ahead and did this bullshit is both shocking and disheartening from a creative standpoint. \\n\\n\r\n...\\n\\n\r\nThis romance continues as we discover that not only does Misaki want our main characters beef-cannon but there's also another, more interesting female in the show that has some tension with the MC as well. This leads to the moment where i realized this show just became fucking dumb really fast. There's a suicide arc in this show and it's so absurdly... absurd, that i just couldn't sit through it with a straight face. I was honestly expecting them to pull the rug from under the viewer and say\" aha! We knew this was dumb all along!\" But no, this was played seriously. \\n\\n\r\nIt was so, so bad. It got so ridiculous that all the interest i had with this show just oozed out of me. The video game arc was almost completely forgotten in favor of just more predictable romance bullshit that I can get from just about any other romance anime out there. The comedy gets slowly forgotten about as well and we are left with these half-good characters in a setting that is yawn-worthy. \\n\\n\r\nWhat's so surprising is that after deciding that this show has lost me completely, I read a bunch of the reviews on MAL. To my surprise people were praising this show for it's realism. The fucking realism! Either these people have no gauge on reality whatsoever or they live in some fantasy anime world where every nerd has a hot girl spying on him from her mansion just waiting to jump at the opportunity to run her fingers through all that greasy hair. \\n\\n\r\nThis kind of unbelievability isn't undercut by anything either. It's played seriously. So the dramatic escalation gets escalated to the point that i can't take it seriously and to the point where I just don't care. All these various characters are introduced within the middle half of the show and they are just about as un-engaging as some characters can get. Welcome to the NHK changed. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Dropping]\\n\\n\r\nAll I can say is that I tried. This show really isn't too bad. It's far from the worst thing i've ever seen. But it lost my interest completely. It's almost like if it didn't start off so good then I would've probably kept watching, if that makes any sense. But i'm a human being, and when a show disappoints me so consistently I begin going into the next episode with a bitter mindset. Or I even begin making excuses why I shouldn't watch the next episode. When I would rather do homework than watch a television show, you know that show must not be doing its job too well. \\n\\n\r\nThat's kind of where NHK left me. I didn't really want to continue watching this show. I felt like I was getting nothing from the viewing experience and these characters were doing nothing but becoming more annoy9ing and oblivious as time went on. Every episode past eight-or-so began introducing elements that I wasn't a fan of. \\n\\n\r\nThat once realistic and fairly funny peak into the life of a socially-awkward and NEET character turned into yet another unrealistic portrayal of a romance that would never actually happen in anything but a TV show. Which is disappointing. I kind of wish it just stayed funny and sporadic and didn't attempt to tell a story it wasn't equipped with telling. By that I mean a story that's been told a million times already. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are going to be addressing a cliche and using it in your story, and literally every story ever has some kind of cliche, then to make that cliche palatable try and put any kind of twist on it. NHK failed to do so and created a product that drained my early infatuation rather quickly. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for something different then this show could deliver that for the first few episodes at least. You get a much more mature, yet immature life of a poor guy living in a small apartment. There is a lot of semi-censored realism to his life and thoughts that even I could relate to. But that realism slowly gets replaced with cliche romance and that eventually reduces this potentially engaging product into a pile of nothing. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cNo human beings, regardless of who they might be, want to look directly at their own shortcomings.\u201d -Satou Tatsuhiro\r\nI came in Welcome to the NHK rather skeptical, thinking that it would be nothing super special, yet I walked out as a completely different person.\r\nBefore I watched Welcome to the NHK, I was suffering from depression and lack of motivation. I was also on the verge of dropping out of college and dealing with substance abuse. I felt as if life had no meaning and was closeting myself increasingly and not leaving the room. I was in the slow process of becoming a hikikomori, something Ihad no idea of what it meant before I watched this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, I was not so impressed mainly because of its rather subpar animation, but then again Welcome to the NHK was made in 2006 and didn't have a high budget. However, despite the low quality animation, the art had this old classic feeling toward it and I quickly became accustomed to it and overlooked its flaws due to all the other aspects of the show being simply outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this anime are amazingly realistic as well. Throughout this anime, we get to see them develop. Satou is basically a hikikomori or in other words a shut in who chain-smokes cigarettes and gets drunk often. Because of his reluctance to see the sunlight, this in result caused hallucinations as well, something clearly realistically depicted in the anime. Despite all this, Satou tried to be a good person to the people he late become close to. He meets this girl named Misaki, who is extremely mysterious but very vulnerable deep down inside but wants to aid Satou by forcing him to sign a contract to meet every night. Satou also met his apartment neighbor Yamazaki, who is at school learning video game developing and is a huge hardcore otaku, and together they focused on making a erotic game. There is also Satou's childhood friend Hitomi who is Satou's long time crush. All of the characters including the side characters in Welcome to the NHK are very useful in the development of the story and none of them are unneeded as we see these characters develop and change attitudes throughout the story. The relationships in Welcome to the NHK are also very realistic, none of them are idealized as every character has their own range of problems. Finally, every episode in the anime serves a purpose and none of them were just specifically fillers. Combined with amazing voice acting especially on Satou's part and a purposeful and well fitting soundtrack, every episode became very enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story of Welome to the NHK transgresses, we get to understand how Satou overcomes his fear of society. Each and every of his sessions with meeting sessions with Misaki was purposeful and filled with deep questions. Each and every incident and obstacle Satou comes across are not usually huge, but successfully depicts the hikikomori problem. As I watched Welcome to the NHK, I saw Satou as the future me if I have continued down the path I was taking.Through seeing myself in the main character's shoes, I took in innumerable lessons and ideas that made me understand my own problem. One crucial lesson I took is how we should see our own shortcomings instead of blaming everything on others. We should understand that we need to fix ourselves before blaming society as always blaming others is not salvation. We don't have a obligation to help society but at least we should understand that we are not perfect and stop being a drag to society. Throughout the end, we get to see many of the characters not taking the most ideal paths they thought but a path that nevertheless made them happy also showing that there are many paths of life throughout life and not achieving your ideal dream is not the end of the world. This also changed my attitude toward life as I realized that dreams are not the end goal. One can always adjust them, and one could always find happiness no matter where life leads as long as one changes his/her attitudes.\\n\\n\r\nThanks to watching Welcome to the NHK, I made a life changing decision to pull myself together instead of falling to complete ruins. The impact of Welcome to the NHK on my life cannot be underestimated and I am forever grateful that I suddenly decided to pick up the anime so if you are depressed or just want something to keep you back on track, Welcome to the NHK is the anime to watch.",

            "content": "Well there are some outstanding reviews of welcome to nhk in MAL... Yet am writing this review because of my love , respect and compassion towards this anime and its writer \"the Tatsuhiko Takimoto\".. \r\n  It is not just an anime... It is the story of numerous NEETs..their dilemma , everything..It brought light to an otherwise unknown disease called \"hikikomori\" to many. The story revolves around a NEET and a hikkomori. The anime deeply goes into his thought process and by doing that, we are able to realise the mental instability, insecurities and obsessiveness of a hikikomori..\r\nAfter seeing the anime, I was greatly touchedby it and made me realise the value of life and felt equally sympathetic to hikikomoris..\\n\\n\r\nAfter reading this review so far, the first impression that you  might be having of this anime is that of a serious and depressing plot.. Well the anime is more than that.. Thats why i have no problem to term it as a gem.. The story amazingly strikes a balance between the former and humour,romance .. Seeing each episode is like going through a complete emotional cycle... There is always something to cheer up and get depressed at most of the instances.. And I have rarely come across such a deadly combination...\\n\\n\r\nAnd what makes this anime stand out? the answer is the background score.. The music is legendary in a way that it will make u feel be taken over by your emotions. Not just the music , the lyrics especially that of Hitori Bocchi gives u sort of an emotional trance.  Everything chord of tight nerves to your brain will feel weakened and the feeling that I experienced cant be put in words..\\n\\n\r\nWell there is nothing as perfect,and in this anime,it is the art which is ordinary. But you will get the hang of it after first few episodes itself. For a anime fan, this will not be an excuse to drop this anime.. \\n\\n\r\nSPOILER--\\n\\n\r\nDont think that it is just an another slice of life anime. It has lots of twists.. And the 24 episodes will finish like just a flash of light.. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, in my opinion there are certain things one has to do before they die.. And seeing this anime should be in that list...\\n",

            "content": "Welcome to the N.H.K is a comedy-drama anime based on a novel written by Takimoto Tatsuhiko. The anime adaptation came out in 2006, four years after the manga, and was developed by Gonzo. You may remember them from Basilisk, Gantz & Bakuretsu Tenshi. This will be the first time I've reviewed a comedic work from Gonzo. So, how do they handle a dramatic comedy?\r\nStory:\r\nSatou Tatsuhiro is a NEET, or a person not employed, not in education and not training. He lives as a, Hikikomori, shut up in his room without interacting with anyone else unless he absolutely has to. That all changes one day whenhe carelessly opens his door for a religious solicitor and her niece. The two are handing out pamphlets about Hikikomori. Rather than shut the door in their faces or openly mock them, which is what a sensible person does when strangers come to their door with religious pamphlets, Satou panics and, in his overmuch protestations to the contrary, outs himself as a Hikikomori. In the hopes of undoing the damage, Satou decides to look at life outside of his apartment and goes job hunting. When he encounters the woman's niece by chance he once again panics and retreats. Later, he finds a letter from the young lady, Misaki, shoved through his mail slot, claiming that she can save him from his Hikikomori ways and asking him to meet her. That's when everything starts to change for Satou.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes right down to it, this anime puts the focus on outcasts of various kinds. Hikikomori, Otaku, the Depressed, Conspiracy Theorists and several other sub-cultures that are generally viewed as strange or worse by polite society. There isn't a single major character that isn't othered in some way. So, let's look at what they do wrong with the concept and then look at what they do well.\\n\\n\r\nThere's only one big problem with the series in terms of the story, but it is a really substantial one. The tone is all over the place. There will be episodes that are largely light-hearted and contain a lot of zany moments and then it'll shift to incredibly serious episodes dealing with suicide. There's even one episode that has really serious moments about suicide with bizarre comedic moments inappropriately mixed into it. The series tries to be dramatic and funny simultaneously, or shortly after each other, which ultimately undermines both aspects.\\n\\n\r\nLet's move onto the positives. While the series definitely has issues with tonal shifts, when it can successfully settle on a tone it does do some interesting things. It is also good about showing its outcasts in a light that's comedic, but also encourages understanding. You laugh at the characters for making idiotic blunders, but you can also sympathise with them and understand why they messed up. The series also does well when it comes to keeping things realistic. About the most outlandish it gets are scenes where Satou is daydreaming or imagining things and inanimate objects talk to him. And, to be fair, that is the kind of daydream someone without much actual social interaction might have.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is made up of social misfits. They're largely portrayed as either pitiable or subjects of schadenfreude, depending on whether the tone is more serious or light-hearted at the moment. I will give the series credit for making them largely realistic in their behaviours and their reasons for those behaviours. That being said, there are times when you'll get a group of characters all being ridiculously gullible at the same exact time and it strains believability. This is most readily apparent in the Multi-level marketing episodes. It can also get annoying when Satou repeats the same mistakes over and over and over again without actually learning anything because learning from experiences is for other people.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good. The characters are very expressive and there is a lot of work put into the various background details. The daydreaming scenes are appropriately surreal and fan-service, when it does come up, is appropriate for the situation. For example, it comes up in Satou's fantasies and with Galges. Both of which are contexts where it makes sense to have that kind of imagery and it's not particularly sexualised when it comes up. It's largely used to show how pathetic Satou and Yamazaki are and how absurd their concept of women is. I do respect the series for taking that route as opposed to devolving into straight up sexualisation. There are a few issues with the art though. The first is that the character movements can be really awkward and stilted at times. Almost like they cut down on frames for time and ended up skipping a few hoping that no one would notice. The character designs themselves are also pretty bland.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe acting in this is mostly good. Sakaguchi Daisuke, Koizumi Yutaka & Makino Yui all give good performances. The one issue with the acting is that the series likes to exaggerate for comedic effect and they can go overboard with it at times. The music is really well thought out. They put a lot of effort into making, say, the \u201cpurin\u201d theme sound like something that would come from an anime like that. They also do a good job of making the ambient music suit the mood. Except in those cases where the mood itself has a tonal clash.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nThe closest the series comes to ho-yay is Satou thinking about having Yamazaki cross dress because he told his mom that he had a girlfriend but it's abundantly clear that that scene is a joke and that both Satou and Yamazaki like girls. So, 1.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nWelcome to the NHK has some good dramatic scenes and some good comedic scenes. It also features good acting, art and it has a good level of realism. Where it runs into trouble is when the comedic and dramatic moments meet or there's a major shift from one to the other. It also has some hiccups with both the art and acting. Furthermore, the characters can be somewhat grating. Still, it is a good series particularly if you have been an outcast in one or more of the ways experienced by the characters. As such, my final rating is a 7/10. Next week I'll continue down the review request list with Mawaru Penguindrum.",

            "content": "I realize that a lot of other reviewers have felt led to write about this gem of an anime - and for good reason. Therefore so will I. \r\nWelcome to the N.H.K. is based off a Japanese novel by Tatsuhiko Takimoto, which has also been released as a manga in 2004 and ended in 2007. (strangely enough the anime came out in 2006 inbetween that time) Perhaps because it was based on a novel - the story doesn't contain any real plot holes or fillers - it flows beautifully. (hmmm just like another gem Baccano! was based off a novel too... very interesting...) In fact,it is one of the most smooth and genuine animes that I have yet seen. Normally with realistic animes (such as Monster) I find it very hard to stay interested... not so with N.H.K. \\n\\n\r\nIn episode one we are introduced to a hikikomori named Satou Tatsuhiro, a twenty-two year old college drop-out who has major panic attacks whenever he is around groups of people. He has gotten the idea that everything is a conspiracy, and that the N.H.K. (Nikon Hikikomori Kyokai - a Japanese television broadcasting company) are behind pretty much everything evil in the world including him being a NEET... (Not in Employment, Education or Training) ...aaaaand that's where I stop about the conspiracy business (God knows they explain it enough in the actual show ha ha) and move on to the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot wouldn't be anything without the in-dept characters; and the fact that we are allowed to glimpse into their lives and experience what they feel and go through with almost brutal honesty... is amazing. Every character has a story to tell, and ALL their stories are, not only very well thought out and told, but touching, sad, and realistic too. (Except you have to hang in there til the end for Misaki's background story. I swear... I had almost given her up as a Lenalee ...ewww) They make you sit up as you recognize yourself or a friend or family member in them. They will not tell you happy stories no... but the realism takes your breath away. That's essentially what this anime is - a breath of fresh air. \\n\\n\r\nOf course... it has bad points. The sloppy character animation frustrated me sometimes - but since it was mainly slice of life and human faces often contort during emotional times - I cut them some slack. (some) The contortion worked best in the humor moments. However, besides that small detail - the rest of the animation was good. I like how the backgrounds were so crisp and clear; so that it gave the impression that people were added in almost as an afterthought. (which was in line with the show's whole message basically of &quot;what is the meaning of life&quot; etc) I give kudos to whoever did set/background designs - Satou's and Yamazaki's apartments were amazing... I wish more sets were that original in set-up - it felt like you could just walk through the computer screen into them. Actually all the sets had that feel. (I know I keep using the adjective *realistic* to describe NHK - but that's what it is.)\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the sound... which I gave a 9 for good reason. The original pieces were amazing and I want to get the whole soundtrack for the first time. (normally I just pick and choose the good tracks) All the pieces were distinctive and definitely memorable and hyped up the emotion in each scene. They also incorporated Japanese rock and some pop - which in my opinion worked very, very well. The OP is unusual, creepy, strange etc... (more animation-wise than the actual song) but it completely fits the show's mood. The first ending song was amazing - the first time I'm really seen such a sadist, comic song used. (but once again, it totally fit and worked) Half-way through the show, they changed endings to suit the definite sober change in mood, seeing as the first ED wouldn't have suited it at all. VA wise... they weren't outstanding - yet everyone's voices fit their character (my favorite performance would probably be Daisuke Sakaguchi as Yamazaki) so definitely no complaints there.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're like me - and enjoy an anime that doesn't back down in the face of realism - that freely consults, assaults, and questions enigmas like: &quot;Why we should matter anyway?&quot; Then this is the anime for you. However, be warned that the dreaded monsters called &quot;hentai&quot; and even one called &quot;Purin&quot; rear their naked heads in this show... beware episode 3 *shudder* (ALRIGHT &gt;.&gt;&quot; I admit it was pretty funny though...) RANDOM SIDE NOTE: The most hilarious arc was the online gaming arc. (I mean wth what else could you do but laugh?!) \\n\\n\r\nBut but but! if you're a happy, smiley type of person who can't bear to think that people would be miserable enough to consider disposing of themselves - then stay clear. This show isn't about happy, pink sparkles - it's about real life issues that people really face every single stinking day.\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all I think this just might be going on my top 5 anime list. 24 episodes is just enough to tell the story - and the ending is one of the best anime endings. It's not cheesy or unnecessary - it just seems RIGHT - and I'm sure if you watch it you'll agree. It makes you think... it doesn't hand you the answer on a silver platter like some animes do.",

            "content": "What is there to say about this show?  I had no prior knowledge of it (I seem to have a habit of getting into shows I know nothing about), and decided to watch it because the cover art looked interesting.  \r\nInitially it starts off fair, you get the typical setup you might expect.  It does well at introducing the main character, but initially I was under the impression that there was a large-scale calamity ahead of him, and what I found out is there actually is, it's just under a different pretense than you're lead to believe (This is a spoiler freereview, don't worry).\\n\\n\r\nWelcome to the NHK broaches on NEETs (Not in education, employment, or training), or more importantly, a hikikomori.  Hikikomori is a phenomena (not exclusive to Japan, but more focused to it) where someone completely shuts themselves out from the outside world.  It's not uncommon for them to even stay in the same room for up to a few years.  The main character is somewhat of a Hikikomori, but not completely.\\n\\n\r\nWhat follows this setup is an outstanding story of someone overcoming themselves with the help of a few good friends.  Don't misunderstand this show for anything other than a slice of life anime, but even if that's not your cup of tea, it's absolutely worth it.  What I felt this show captivated very well was having us really empathize with the main character.  A lot of people really understand the urge to break away from the outside world and stay in a cocoon to yourself, because that's an area of safety.  So while we're not all Hikikomori, it's something we can relate to regardless.  \\n\\n\r\nAs stated before, the show starts off fairly, you get a pretty common setup.  But a while through the show, something a bit unexpected happens that forces our main character to really challenge himself, and does something a little odd as a result.  The common setup kind of breaks out and becomes its own thing, and you're left wondering what's going to happen next.  This happens just when I felt like I had the show figured out, and it was a pretty pleasant surprise.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not a lot to say about it really, it's a slice of life anime, and it's something you have to experience to really appreciate what it broaches on.  I felt a pretty good connection with the characters, and really enjoyed what it brought to the table.  The art was a little strange sometimes, but wasn't by any means disruptive.  The sound quality was good, but I unfortunately didn't make any noticeable impressions on the music.  It's not action packed, it's not even a rollercoaster ride, but what they pulled off with it was absolutely amazing.  I don't know what kept me coming back to it, but I finished it pretty quickly wanting to know what happens next, even if I couldn't even define what was happening at all.  Above all, it closes in a pretty NEET package (hue, pun).",

However, while the main goal of the supporting character is to cure him of this sickness, it never really seems to affect him all that much. The idea is that this guy, Sato, can't even go outside because he is a recluse. One day in his past, people started laughing in general and he was like \"omg they're laughing at me, time to never go outside again.' And that's all you get. There was no reason forhim to act this way, totally unprompted.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, half the show is spent working toward a goal that is dropped a few episodes before the end. \"Oh it didn't work...oh, well.\" It seems like the 20 episodes in the middle were used to introduce a few \"deep\" quotes by some of the main characters so that we could hear them again at the end when Sato is thinking back on his life. And they were the most cringe-worthy quotes I have ever heard.\\n\\n\r\nI felt completely unsatisfied and it is really beyond me how this show has more than a 4.",

            "content": "Welcome to the NHK is one of the few anime that I watched that I found very realistic, something that can rely to the real world.. which is very different then the other popular animes these days. If you have not noticed, novelist Tatsuhiko Takimoto in my opinion, is very talented when writing his story about \"conspiracy\" and \"hikikomori\" which I believed had changed many hearts of these hikikomoris in the real life world today. This anime had shown all of us the spirit of protagonist Sato while facing his different difficulties in life. A great thing about this anime is that the novelist hadput a pint of drama and romance, which is a big plus to hook us into watching this. But the greatest advantage, was the use of japanese subcultures in all of the episodes. I myself live in Taiwan, which currently has increased more hikkomoris during present day. These subcultures and elements the novelist have used to enhance his story includes the use of \"neet\", the few episodes with (spoiler alert!!) \"virtual gaming\" \"otaku/lolicons\" and my personal favorite, the \"internet suicide\". \\n\\n\r\nAll these activities have been quite famous today, and are quite interesting elements that this novelist have put to this psychological anime. This brings me to my next point, about the current psychological animes you find in your favorite tv shows. In my point of view, psychological based anime/manga you find today always fit together with one of the genres that I fear the most.. HORROR. But personally, I believe that psychological animes do fit quite well with horror, but it always makes the audience warned and prepared for the shocking part. On the other hand, Welcome to the NHK is different than all those psychological animes you find today, by adding the element of comedy into the real life world. There are many people in risk today just like Sato san, who always hoped there was that one girl who would pop out of nowhere to save your life. \\n\\n\r\nAnother great plus to this anime is the music of course ^ ^\\n\r\nPuzzle, the opening music and animation is just amazing, and fit quite well with the atmosphere of the original anime. In my view of this song, Sato is uncovering the secrets of the N.H.K aka (refrigerator with a face talking to you at nightime) just like you do on a puzzle. Another meaning may be that Sato is mentally-wise puzzled with his life, like he cannot fit the final piece of puzzle into that blank spot of his human being. Another great music from the anime is the Puru Puru Pururin, which basically let us know what these hikkomoris listen to these days. ^^\\n\\n\r\nGreat thing about NHK is the character personalities that were shown so specifically. In my point of view, Sato-san's personality was quite dull until he had met Yamazaki-san, who I think had the most personality throughout the anime. From his real life experiences, you can clearly feel what kind of person he is, and how much he intended on his (spoiler) to success. On the other hand, Sato-san also had a perfect-pitched personality, good enough for all of us to know what kind of person he is. In my point of view, all the main characters in the anime had their personalities shown very well. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this anime, one of my favorites that I had watched throughout a long time, and I hope this novelist will release another novel for us to enjoy. (It is quite a shame because he only had Welcome to the NHK as one of his popular works) Overall, I really recommend this anime to all you \"hikkomoris\" out there, and (if you really are) you may gain yourself a different feeling towards your future.",

            "content": "Welcome to the NHK is a good, yet heavily flawed anime.\r\nStory:\r\nI went into Welcome to the NHK looking forward to a deep and personal exploration into the psychological themes of depression and hikikomori, with some fun comedy mixed in, which to some extent it was. The comedy was consistently good and I admire how NHK approaches some serious and uncomfortable issues respectfully. Especially with topics such as suicide it can be very difficult not to over-dramatize it for the purpose of entertainment, but I feel that this anime is genuine in that regard. There isn't much of a strong overarching story as much as thereis a series of short story arcs progressed by the development of the main character, Satou. These arcs can be pretty hit or miss, but overall the show does have a nice progression with a good climax. There are certain themes of the show that I felt it could have explored a lot deeper, especially the NHK organisation conspiracy that is rarely mentioned despite being in the name of the anime. I can't say I was overly impressed or surprised by anything that happened in the overall story but it was definitely enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe animation in this anime is disappointingly inconsistent, I almost want to know what was going on during the production of NHK because there is just such a night and day difference between the animation quality of some episodes. There were points where I loved the art, I thought much of the warm colour palettes and smooth yet minimal animation perfectly complemented the atmosphere of the show. However there is a certain point around the middle of the series where the animation takes an obvious nosedive in quality, and ends up looking extremely lazy and uninteresting. I will say though that I did like the realistically drawn character designs a lot. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI loved the OST for Welcome to the NHK, it's probably the only aspect of the show that I don't have any major negative criticisms for. The opening theme is fantastic and the first ending theme is hilarious, also the choices of music during scenes always complemented the show very well in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters of NHK are easily the best and worst parts of the anime. I'll start by saying that the chemistry and humour between characters is mostly very good, and probably what kept me watching all the way through. I found Yamazaki very entertaining, and liked his dynamic with Satou of pointing out his bullshit, as well as Misaki who I became very attached to by the end of the anime. Almost every character was appealing to some extent except for the protagonist, Satou. By the end of NHK, it's almost impossible to sympathise with Satou in any way for me. For every time he makes sure to remind you that he's a hopeless shut-in hikikomori (and believe me he does a fucking lot), I find it harder and harder to believe that he's actually hikikomori and not just a shitty human being and an unrealistic character. First of all, I get that he is a shut-in NEET, but am I meant to believe he spent three years in his apartment doing quite literally nothing? The show seems to tell us he doesn't play games, he doesn't create anything, he doesn't seem to watch or read anything, did he just sit there in complete silence for three years until this pretty girl suddenly appeared in his life? Either Satou's hikikomori lifestyle makes no sense or the creators don't understand what hikikomori is actually like. Not only that, but he is just a self-centered dick to the people around him. I understand that he is supposed to be flawed, especially socially but it gets to a point in this show where he is constantly treating everyone around him like shit for his own selfish reasons, and at this point I don't even get why I'm meant to feel bad for him or understand why Misaki supposedly loves him any more. Satou just isn't a believable hikikomori. For the amount of time during this series that he spends in public meeting other people, he clearly isn't socially inept and is somewhat intelligent. I'm just not convinced that this guy is the hopeless shut-in that he's supposed to be, and it really makes it difficult to connect with the show's message. I do still think that NHK represents a lot of psychological and social issues well, especially in supporting characters such as Hitomi and Kobayashi, but unfortunately it misses the mark on Satou's hikikomori condition for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment / Overall:\\n\r\nWhile I have a lot of issues with Welcome to the NHK I can't deny that I did enjoy watching it from start to finish, it was only once I was done with the anime that I began to realise it may not have been as deep as I initially thought. Overall I would probably still recommend NHK to anyone interested in psychological themes, or looking for a decent drama/comedy anime.\\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n",

It presents itself as if its a work of art.  Its not.  More perverse than funny.  Soon it became painfull to watch.  If you want an idea of what kind of humour is employed in this anime then I will give you an example:  The main charatcer becomes a pedophile and tries to take pictures of little girls because he thinks its whats expected of \"histype of person\".  There.  Hilarious?  I thought it was a pretty poor attempt at humour to be honest.  I only stuck with the anime so far so that I could stand up against \"You cant judge you didnt watch most of it\"  I failed.  This anime was just to painfull and I ran away screaming.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is typical of Gonzo.  Decently well drawn with fluid animation but not exceptional.  The romantic comedy scenes were great.  In so far as the characters just appear to stop thinking, which is a lot more bearable than watching them think out quotations from freuds big book of neurosis, of course with a comedic twist...\\n\\n\r\nI guess I just cant bear anime that sink to such levels of stupidity.

The story revolves around the peaks and the pits of Satou's life, the hardships and the anxiety, but also the mystery and optimism the the great unknown - also known as \"the real world\". \r\nSatou's character is pretty atypical in the realm of anime. Yes, he's an lonely outcast like many protags, but he is different: no matter how many times he tries to get up, he falls back down. He shows a lot of real, human characteristics that everyone can relate to in this sense. Lifeisn't just a  24 episode anime where your life suddenly turns for the better around episode 6. No, Satou is a complete fuck up, and when we think he's going to change his hikikomori ways, he always goes back to his same habits. This is an utterly frustrating cycle that keeps the viewer interested in his story, which comes from some really great development. \\n\\n\r\nNaturally, Satou had the most development of all, but it ended up taking anyway from the supporting characters. I was wanting to see more of the supporting characters' backstories, their own tragedies and struggles, and how the person they've become has gone on to impact Satou's development. Additionally, since one of the genres is \"Psychological\", I was hoping to see some more... you know, existentialist, thought-provoking dialogues and some more raw emotion or something. However, a lot of that had to come from you, the viewer, to see the meaning in the small change in characters and events. \\n\\n\r\nBut the seemingly trivial experience of this NEET still leaves an impact. This is a story of finding friends, finding purpose, and finding hope in a life that is filled with dead ends. The real humanity found in these characters mirrors what we see in ourselves and those who have trouble supporting us, and those we wish could be by our side. In Satou's realizations, his breakdowns and delusions, you can't help but feel a little less alone in a world so overwhelmingly large. \\n\\n\r\nGood sound and animation, though nothing outstanding. A raw, thought-provoking narrative that is definitely worth watching.",

            "content": "I rarely write reviews for the shows. It frequently stems from the fact that I think poorly about my writing; That people won't read it even if I try. Even when I've tried few times, it was a failure. So, how many times do we fail in our lives, even if we try? And do we ever stop failing in life? The answer is no. But we can always try, and the circle of failing and getting up is what makes our life a wonderful experience, albeit sometimes depressing and mellow. This is what NHK is all about. \r\nIt's show which does not refrain fromshowing dark, disgusting side of every person, since every single person on this planet had to grow up at some point. This growing up is often a cocktail of drinking, smoking, watching porn until morning, wasting time and money on video-games, and rarely a ride full of pleasure. By showing this dark side, this anime presents itself as a novelty in world of slice of life genre where characters often lead perfect, untroubled lives. \\n\r\nSTORY: I've put the highest possible score here. You wonder why? I've already told that this anime is novelty, and I'm sticking with my opinion. I've watched only thirty-four anime shows in my life, and yet I can see that some patterns are being used again and again. Cute girls leading cute lives, fairy-tale romance, moe humor or fanservice, rinse and repeat.  I repeat, this anime shatters every possible stereotype which there is. Aside from a bit of fanservice, story is dark, focusing on a mind of shut-in called Tatsuhiro Sato, who tries hard to make something out of his life, failing miserably all along the way. On the way he meets anime otaku Yamazaki, strange girl called Misaki and atop of that, there is his old love, Hitomi. Story is having an excellent pace, with a satisfying resolution, and is unlike anything that I've ever seen. \\n\r\nART: Animation in this anime isn't all that great. Somewhere around episode four I was \"this\" close to dropping it because animation quality looked horrifying. But, most of the times it's fair enough, and with the topic which  show covers this animation does its job. The thing I liked most is the total lack of censure, especially later on, which greatly enhances ever-present feeling of reality. \\n\r\nSOUND: I adored the opening, ending, even songs inside of the anime were great. Every song goes along with story, lyrics often portraying states where characters are in. Emotional scenes are often enhanced by emotional OST's, but all in all it can't be compared to musical masterpieces like Monogatari. It's great, but it's not something you will download and listen when you finish. Sound effects and everything else is great.\\n\r\nCHARACTER: This is where show shines most brightly. Every single one of characters in the show went through the hell. It almost looked like author enjoyed torturing them, just to make them appreciate the fact that they are alive when everything ended up. And because of those sufferings, everyone shows outstanding progression. From Satou, who gradually accepts reality of the world, to Yamazaki who settles down, all the way to Misaki and Hitomi. I don't want to spoil, so I will let you see for yourself. \\n\r\nALL IN ALL:\\n\r\nI've enjoyed this show - this might be the best show that I've ever seen. To me, it topples down even a masterpiece like Steins;Gate, because it covers the topic that we're all related to: shameful, scary, horrifying process of growing up. \\n\r\nIn the end, I will recommend this show to every anime fan. Unlike other shows, this show does not sugarcoat life, giving it grim but accurate description. And, if you realize that you've grown up just a little bit after watching it, then this anime fulfilled it's purpose.",

            "content": "-Note: English is not my native language, I apologize for possible mistakes. (Review in English and Spanish)\r\nWelcome to the NHK is a story that deserves to be seen more than once, for me a little gem and one of the best anime I've had the pleasure of seeing, touching a realist and very disturbing theme of Japanese society and not only Japanese, since exclusion, estrangement, social fear affects many people around the world.\r\nI think there is no other anime until the moment to touch this topic and to touch it in a very good way like Welcome to the NHK and I have to saysomething, do not expect a humorous story with colors of roses and romantic, if this has love and also humor (although black humor), but it is not as it may appear at the beginning, it is a rise and fall of constant emotions which more than one will leave thinking at the end ... and certainly not confuse the term \" neet\" with \"hikikomori\" a hikikomori in essence it can also be a neet of course, but the term\" hiki \"encompasses all that person who is completely isolated for months or in the worst case without leaving home almost never for years, usually the neets are people who only spend time without study or work but otherwise they can lead a normal life until then, although of course I think there is no term that encompasses people with the \"hiki\" syndrome in the West, but they exist of course and everywhere, even if they are treated differently.\\n\\n\r\n-History: The story follows our protagonist Satou, 22 years old, an ex-university student who abandoned his studies due to social weaknesses and lack of self-confidence, as well as having problems adapting to society and having a fear of it. This led him to become a hikikomori for almost 4 years (move away from society, being in seclusion social or serious social withdrawal) after all that time one day he meets Misaki \"The Angel Misaki or the Goddess Misaki\" a pretty young girl that before all prognosis and reality for the protagonist seeks to help him out of his hikikomori problem and his neighbor Yamazaki an old acquaintance of the school who also does not lead a good life and who likewise serves as a great and important support, all three embark on a fun and interesting story in which we can see the emotional and mental weaknesses and problems of them and other characters develop throughout the story, which is full of several psychological situations, melancholys, depressing, overcoming and interesting turns.\\n\\n\r\n-Art: The art is very good, I think it fits very well with the theme of the story and series, I really did not have any displeasure or do not remember having it, it is a very decent section.\\n\\n\r\n-Music / OST: Music was one of the best things in this series, the opening theme as the output, as well as its OST in general are very good, its lyrics reflect much of the theme of the series, I really enjoy this section and good what can I say of !!Puru Puru Pururin \u266b!!? Everyone who saw it will know which song I mean, it can be a conspiracy! That's right! a totally conspirative song, but it's great! and I can not get it out of my head ... poor Satou!\\n\\n\r\n-Characters: The best of the series without a doubt, they are very realistic characters and you will understand them by advancing the series, discovering new unknown faces or understanding them better and discovering things that you did not expect above all of a particular character. Of course I personally see myself in obligation to say that I see myself in many aspects reflected in various behaviors and situations with the protagonist and also with others and I am sure that a good part of the audience it will also look a little, this only makes it even better, although of course that can touch you.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment? 9.5/10 enjoyment from start to finish\\n\\n\r\n-Conclusion/Overall: It is undoubtedly one of the best stories and anime that I have had the pleasure to follow, I would recommend it to anyone and I know that most will enjoy it in the same or less way than me, but you will like it. And nothing remember that we live in a conspiracy and if by chance you feel referenced or you see yourself in the story, remember is only the fault of the N.H.K.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------Espa\u00f1ol/Spanish--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nWelcome to the NHK es una historia que merece ser vista m\u00e1s de una vez, para m\u00ed una joyita y uno de los mejores animes que he tenido el placer de ver, tocando un tema realista y muy preocupante de la sociedad Japonesa y no solo Japonesa, ya que la exclusi\u00f3n, el alejamiento, temor social afecta a muchas personas en todo el mundo.\\n\\n\r\nCreo que no hay ning\u00fan otro anime hasta el momento que toque este tema y lo ejecute de una muy buena manera como Welcome to the NHK y es que tengo que decir algo, no esperes una historia de humor con colores de rosas y rom\u00e1ntica, si tiene amor y  tambi\u00e9n humor(aunque humor negro eso s\u00ed), pero no es como lo pueda aparentar al principio, es una subida y bajada de emociones constantes el cual a m\u00e1s de uno lo dejara pensando al finalizar\u2026.y por cierto no confundir el t\u00e9rmino \u201cneet\u201d con \u201chikikomori\u201d un hikikomori en esencia tambi\u00e9n puede ser un neet claro, pero el t\u00e9rmino \u201chiki\u201d engloba a toda aquella persona que se a\u00edsla completamente por meses o en el peor de los casos a\u00f1os sin salir de su casa pr\u00e1cticamente nunca, usualmente los neets son personas que solo pasan un tiempo sin estudio o trabajo pero fuera de eso pueden llevar una vida normal hasta entonces, aunque por supuesto creo no hay un t\u00e9rmino que englobe a las personas con el s\u00edndrome \u201chiki\u201d en occidente, pero existen por supuesto y en todos lados, aunque se trate de manera diferente.\\n\\n\r\n-Historia: La historia sigue a nuestro protagonista Satou de 22 a\u00f1os de edad, un ex-universitario el cual abandono sus estudios por debilidades sociales y falta de seguridad en s\u00ed mismo, as\u00ed como tener problemas para adaptarse en sociedad y tener un temor a ella, esto lo llevo a convertirse en un hikikomori por casi 4 a\u00f1os  (apartarse de la sociedad, estar recluido o alejamiento social grave) despu\u00e9s de todo ese tiempo un d\u00eda conoce a Misaki \"La Angel Misaki o la Diosa Misaki\" una linda jovencita que ante todo pron\u00f3stico y realidad para el protagonista busca ayudarle para salir de su problema de hikikomori y su vecino Yamazaki un viejo conocido de la escuela que tampoco lleva una vida nada buena y que de igual manera le sirve como un gran e importante soporte, los tres se embarcan en una divertida e interesante historia en la que podremos ver las debilidades emocionales , mentales y problemas de ellos y otros personajes desarrollarse a lo largo de la historia, la cual est\u00e1 llena de varias situaciones psicol\u00f3gicas, melanc\u00f3licas, deprimentes, superaci\u00f3n y de giros interesantes.\\n\\n\r\n-Arte: El arte es muy bueno, creo que queda muy bien con el tema de la historia y serie, realmente no tuve ning\u00fan disgusto o no recuerdo tenerlo, es un apartado muy decente.\\n\\n\r\n-M\u00fasica/OST: La m\u00fasica fue una de las mejores cosas de esta serie, el tema de apertura como el de salida, as\u00ed como su OST en general son muy buenas, su letra refleja mucho del tema del que trata la serie, disfrute mucho este apartado y bueno que puedo decir de !Puru Puru Pururin \u266b! todo el que la vio sabr\u00e1 a cual canci\u00f3n me refiero, puede tratarse de una conspiraci\u00f3n !as\u00ed es! una canci\u00f3n totalmente conspirativa \u00a1!pero es genial! y no me la puedo sacar de la cabeza....pobre Satou!!\\n\\n\r\n-Personajes: Lo mejor de la serie sin duda, son personajes muy realistas y los vas entendiendo mediante avanza la serie, vas descubriendo nuevas caras desconocidas o comprendi\u00e9ndolos mejor y descubriendo cosas que no esperabas sobretodo de un personaje en especial, por supuesto me veo personalmente en obligaci\u00f3n a decir que me veo en muchos aspectos reflejado en varios comportamientos y situaciones con el protagonista y tambi\u00e9n con los dem\u00e1s y estoy seguro que buena parte de la audiencia tambi\u00e9n lo estar\u00e1 aunque sea un poco, esto solo lo vuelve a\u00fan mejor, aunque pueda llegar a tocarte.\\n\\n\r\n-\u00bfGusto? 9.5/10 la disfrute de principio a fin\\n\\n\r\n-Conclusi\u00f3n: Es sin duda una de las mejores historias y animes que he tenido el placer de seguir, se la recomendar\u00eda a cualquiera y s\u00e9 que la mayor\u00eda la disfrutara de igual o menor manera que yo, pero le gustara y pues nada recuerden que vivimos en una conspiraci\u00f3n y si por casualidad te sientes referenciado o te ves a ti mismo en la historia, recuerda es solo culpa de la N.H.K.\\n",

I put too much stock in them and didn't realize how much they strayed from the N.H.K being this sinister corporation and messing with this guys life. That description made me think it would be a decent anime. The first 5 or 6 episode actually had my interest. There were some good scenes like when he dropped all his girly mags in front of his mom. It reminded me alot of G.T.O. They even built up the conspiracy aspect a little and I liked Sato and his personality. Then, that girl he played cards with came intohis life and all seemed to change. It became too much of a &quot;slice of life&quot; or &quot;romance&quot; type anime and I just don't like those. I stopped on episode 19 cause I just lost interest all together. They started helping others and totally got away from the conspiracy aspect that I was looking for. Alot like G.T.O, this could have been better if they geared it towards more adult audience. It was my own fault for not doing enough research. I may be one of the few (and no offense to all those that like this one), but this just ain't that good to warrant the hype.",

            "content": "The first thing which struck my mind when I saw the title \"Welcome to NHK\" was the japanese tv channel \"NHK\". I was taken by surprise by this anime indeed. It's the first time I encountered this problem called \"Hikkikomori\", I made a research and after knowing the background of a hikkikomori, I gave this anime a thorough observance. Let's proceed to the review.\r\nThe story is pretty amazing, Welcome to N.H.K. is the story of a hikkikomori (a hikkikomori is a person who doesn't work, study and is afraid to go outside due to the fact that a hikkikomori is often referred to as someonewho is afraid to socialize with others.) named Satou, our main protagonist. Welcome to NHK showcases the uprising problem of Japan's society today and that is being a hikkikomori. People who are lonely, an otaku who is rejected socially at school, people who sold their souls to MMORPG, victims of Multi-level marketing strategy, You name it! It's all here.\\n\\n\r\n Each and every episode sends off the depressing aura, delivered in a well humurous manner. There are times that you will laugh about Satou with him being a hikkikomori but of course there also comes the time wherein you'd feel Satou's loneliness, pain and sufferring, striving to escape the chains of being a hikkikomori.\\n\\n\r\nGonzo's art on this one is pretty impressive, the animation is portrayed accurately delivered on it's simplest form. Inevitably, there are some times wherein the characters are drawn in an awkward way however this does not hinder you from watching it. If you've been a fan of Gonzo before, you better check this one out, personally I think this is the best animation they did ever. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is way too cool. The OP and ED themes were awesome. The BGM's are easy to get used to and you would notice that they have been used repeatedly but these limited tracks makes their way onto a scene in a perfectly timed matter. Musically, the tracks used in this anime is high above passable.\\n\\n\r\nAs the story progresses, different characters with different problems appear. I loved all of the characters for they are very interesting. Simillar to your typical slice of life characters which circles around Satou's life.  Watch these characters succeed, or fail perhaps. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime, well who would not? It's packed with tons of funny and cool moments. If you're a hikkikomori yourself or if even you have the characteristics of being a hikkikomori, you should give this anime a watch, it's a must! Or if you think you would enjoy watching an anime character who fails over and over, watching Welcome to NHK is a must! Or else you'll be fined 1,000,000 yen :3\\n",

            "content": "*WARNING! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE SHOW WELCOME TO THE NHK*\r\nBy a show of hands, how many of you have felt lonely? Isolated? Shut-off from society? I better be seeing the whole lot of you raising your hands, because that's just a part of being human, and I don't care if you sleep with a million women a night, there had to be at least one point of time where you felt lonely. Welcome to the NHK is a show that plays off that lonely emotion we've all felt, and shows you what true isolation looks like.\r\nStory: 9/10 - Welcome to the NHK followsa \"mildly\" unstable 22 year-old Hikikomori/NEET named Satou.  What is a \"Hikikomori\" and a \"NEET,\" you ask? A Hikikomori (Japanese for \"Pulling Inwards\") is someone who spends their lives either locked in their apartment or in their rooms. They rarely go outside, and when they do, it's for basic necessities. And NEET stands for \"Not in Education, Employment, or Training,\" so in other words... completely unemployed. And now back to the main character, Satou. He's been in his apartment as a Hikikomori for a good 5 years now, following the same daily routine of watching TV, playing on the computer, smoking cigarettes, and yelling at his Otaku neighbor for the loud music. This of course changes when a cute 18 year-old girl named Misaki and her Aunt knock on his door. They were both doing church service and were providing information on how to cure someone of being a \"NEET.\" Misaki takes note of Satou's lifestyle, and invites him to a little \"project\" of hers, which is supposed to cure him of being a Hikikomori. Satou signed a contract with Misaki, stating that he will meet her at the park every night for counseling, and if Satou decides to cancel these meetings, he is forced to pay a hefty fine. Satou soon discovers that his neighbor was really an old high school friend of his (Yamazaki), and they decide to team up to make a game... a hentai game, that is! Of course, Satou slacks of with writing the plot, while leaving most of the work on his developer friend. The really cool thing about the storyline is the fact that is covers a lot of issues in Japan (Like suicide, Hikikomoris, etc.), and wraps it up really nicely. My one complaint for the show was the lack-luster ending. I really expected a lot more from this show than a \"lets blame all our problems on other people\" ending. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10 - The art is absolutely insane in every degree... AND I LOVE IT! There is no better way to show what's truly going through Satou's mind than to have his fucking fridge and computer come to life and lecture him on everything. They made a dirty apartment look like everything has it's own storyline, and that always amazes me that they were able to pull that off.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10 - First off, the voice acting (both Japanese and English) is phenomenal. I really want to recognize Chris Patton and Yutaka Koizumi for their outstanding job at voicing Satou. And let's not forget the soundtrack. Honestly, there is no better soundtrack out there to smoke a cigarette too and think about life than Welcome to the NHK's soundtrack. Hitori no Tame no Lullaby and Gosui ni Tarasu Tsuri Ito are great pieces that really adds on to the tone of the story. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10 - I'm going to say it right now, the only character I truly liked from start to finish was Misaki. Is that a bad thing? No, because that's what the show intended on. Satou is probably the most relate-able character in anime history (for me, at least). However, there our times that I just want to scream at Satou: \"Stop being such a fucking dick.\" And as for Yamazaki? He honestly made a great addition to the story. Was he annoying at times? Yes. But, he was also a great comic relief with his famous quote: \"Begone dirty whores!\" I honestly felt bad for Yamazaki that he had to give up his dreams as a computer programmer to work on a stupid farm. And the fact that he had the girl of his dreams hate him so she won't become heartbroken later was... well... I honestly don't know, that gave me so many mixed emotions that I'm still debating if I should respect Yamazaki for that, or hate him. And for our last major character, Misaki. Misaki was so sweet and lovable all throughout the series, who only wanted to help out Satou so she can feel like she has a purpose in this world. However, Misaki was kinda of the shows emotional punching bag. Between Satou's near suicide, abusive step-father, Satou's constantly being a dick to her, she deals with all the shit the show throws at her, and does a great job at it as well. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 - There were points of this show where I was laughing my ass off. Honestly, this is probably the funniest anime I've seen yet. But, there where just as many times where it brought me to the brink of tears. This show is one giant emotional roller coaster, so be prepared. \\n\\n\r\nGod, I honestly can't even begin to say how great of a show this is. It has it's problems (*Cough* *Cough* No confirmation on Satou and Misaki OTP *Cough* *Cough*), but the show itself is so phenomenal and meaningful that I can't give it anything else than a... Overall: 10/10",

            "content": "There are many shows bringing up real life issues, the main one being financial problems. A lot of back stories involve a person disappearing or dying because of money problem such as in [C]. Another issue would be bullying, like in most harem shows, the main character saves the bullied heroine, although I believe it is always done in such a lighthearted way that it is hardly believable. Lastly, the hikikomori issue has been pretty popular in anime lately. Example, the NEET detective in Kamisama no Memouchou and Itazu Yutaka from Higashi no Eden. The real issue is that, even though being a hikikomori shouldn'tbe a good thing, it is still treated lightheartedly and never faced as a real problem by anyone. \\n\\n\r\nWelcome to the NHK, adapted by Gonzo in 2006, approaches the hikikomori subject (and many other problems, such as drugs, money problems, suicide, scams) in a more problematic and realistic way. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a shut-in named Satou Tasuihiro and his various problems in life, and his ascension from a hikikomori to a normal person. Not only has he been confined inside his house for four years, he still depends on his parents still lend him money instead of giving him a good kick in the back and force him to do something. Then, he is visited by a young girl named Nakahara Mai, who wants to help him get back on track. Not only do we approach Satou's problems, but we also find out that everyone around him aren't so perfect either! And so, the problem solving story begins. Yet, either they don't try to solve their problems and try to escape them with some lame excuse as a backup, or they don't solve their problems the right way, which makes it amazing because it makes the story realistic. If they had faced their problems and immediately solved them without breaking a sweat, I would call this show ''Mary Sue : The Animation.' Overall, the story was very satisfying, comedic scenes were actually funny, ecchi wasn't overdone, nor were panty shots.The ending was concluding, and not the usual bullshit open one, leaving no room for a sequel. (Who needs a sequel about problem solving anyway?)\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem in most anime is that characters oustide of the main cast (in some case, inside AND outside) are one dimensional, unrealistic and just plain uninteresting. Instead, in Welcome to the NHK, almost every one of them are colorized by their issues in life, having their up and their downs without playing too much with the extremes, which makes them realistic. So realistic that I can relate to some of their problems, especially Satou's issues. As the story progresses, the main characters undergo a change in their behavior, but the changes are actually believable. In anime like Clannad, the main character would suddenly find life motivating without much development in his character. Yet, Satou progressively got worse and worse, only to go back to his usual hikikomori way in the end. You call it regression, I call it improvement compared to how low he fell down during the events of the series.\\n\\n\r\nGonzo decided to use a realistic style of animation in this show. The style isn't so unique as realistic art are used in a lot of anime (a major example being Monster). It fits the mood perfectly; who would want crazy drawings that are barely related to reality in a show trying to bring up real life issues? The animation was kinda choppy at times, but at least there wasn't much CG, and that is a good thing when we're talking about Gonzo. Character designs were pretty normal, trying to fit with the realistic mood.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was done well. I liked Satou's voice because it fits him perfectly. The background music isn't so special either. Although, there's a song that I liked a lot, which played very often, too. I believe the name was ''Youkoso! Hitori Bocchi''.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Welcome to the NHK is a show I would rewatch many, many times because it never gets old; As long as I related to their problems, I think I would keep on rewatching it. I enjoyed it so much because of all the things I mentioned, an above all, the realistic aspect. I definitely recommend this anime to people looking for an anime that isn't afraid of bringing up issues a lot of people can relate to.",

            "content": "Let me take you back to me, a few years ago.\r\nThis is gonna be a long one, by the way, so grab a drink or something.\r\nI have this really odd thing about how to handle certain situations and/or circumstances, especially the ones I could've had impact on. I guess one could say the same thing as my doctor back then when he diagnosed me with something he called an \"affective disorder\" - or, well, depression, as one may call it. I didn't really get how he'd come to that conclusion, I thought: \"Well, I hate getting up in the morning to go to work, Ihave called in sick a bunch of times because I wasn't able to get myself together and felt like shit for no particular reason, there was this one time I took a two-week-vacation to stay at home to play video games (even though I actually wanted to visit my family during that time, but I was way too ashamed of myself and my nerdiness and my, well, \"me\" to go there, so I lied about being sick with the flu or something), and that other time I didn't leave the house for a month because I was afraid to face the people at my work place (author's note: I was a mobbing victim for quite some time. Wasn't pretty.), and I can't stand to look at myself in the mirror because I fucking hate my stupid-ass face more than anybody else - BUT I'M FINE.\"\\n\\n\r\nIt took me another two months or so to actually come to terms with the fact that I was, in fact, not fine. The thing about getting a diagnosis like this is a) you don't really actually believe it yourself at first and think everyone's full of shit and b) you subconsiously know that you're the one who's full of shit and that you are indeed ill - you're just not ready to accept option b), yet. The thing that finally pushed me over the edge and made me admit I needed help was - of all things - a goddamn Japanese cartoon. More specifically, it was \"Welcome to the NHK\" that gave me the push.\\n\\n\r\nTatsuhiro Sato (which is basically the equivalent of having the name \"John Smith\" in English) is a NEET (= Not in Employment, in Education, or in Training) who hasn't left his appartment for quite some time after a hot summer's day that made him realize the world was full of conspiracies against him. When the young, enigmatic Misaki offers to cure him of his hikikomori-\"disease\" by counseling him, he learns how to integrate himself back into the world, step by step - which, as it turns out, is a rocky-ass road that is paved with loads of disappointments, disastrous situations, addictions, gallows humor and some of the most (sometimes more, sometimes less) charmingly fucked up characters I for one have ever seen in a television program, anime or not.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes NHK work so incredibly well - especially for people like me who know how it feels like to be left out of the world, voluntarily or not - is, for one, that it's based on one of the best contemporary novels I've ever read. The anime stays very true to Tatsuhiko Takimoto's novel, adding at least one plotpoint and changing a few others, to make the series flow a little better and make it a little more TV-friendly (e.g. it downplays Sato's drug problem, which is a big factor in the novel). But don't let that fool ya: this series is relentlessly vicious and downright brutally honest with itself and its characters. The way it deals with otaku culture alone, exploring the good aspects as well as the bad ones without holding back, deserves a big high five towards its creators GONZO.\\n\\n\r\nYes, _the_ GONZO. The same dudes who gave us Vandread, Burst Angel and the infamous Witchblade-anime. They had already proven with SaiKano, Gankutsou and Blue Sub No. 6 that they were actually able to create anime that went beyond \"Bigass titties and gore\". You can say about their output what you want, but they created their own little masterpiece with NHK, in almost every category.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle is very stark and takes a realistic approach at its character designs most of the time. The occasional, GONZO-typical animation hick-ups and some pretty jarring moments of characters completely loosing shape and all kinds of body proportions make the art and animation kind of inconstistent, but whenever it's good, it's REALLY good and downright inspiring. My favorite moments are the flashbacks to Sato's highschool days and some intense moments featuring a certain person being tormented by another person's presence.\\n\\n\r\nSoundwise, you really can't go wrong, both dubs (Japanese and English, that is) work really well, the voice actors all turn in really good performances and clearly enjoy voicing the most broken-ass people you can imagine in a slice-of-life'ish anime series. I want to highlight the English dub in perticular for its well-written, well-translated script and the - excuse my French - FUCKING AMAZING performances by Chris Patton as Sato and Greg Ayres as his hardcore otaku-buddy Yamazaki. Holy cow, these guys steal the show and run away with it. Especially Patton's performance is a sight to behold. The very independent-movie'esque soundtrack and the awesome opening song by Round Table are the icing on the cake. One minus point for excluding the trumpet part in the \"second\" opening, though (which is basically a remixed and - in my opinion - less fun version of the first one).\\n\r\nBy the by: \"You ask if I'm okay? OF COURSE I'M OKAY! I'm fucking BETTER THAN OKAY, thank you very much!\" may also be one of my favorite lines in anything ever.\\n\\n\r\nThe real deal about the series, and the thing that ultimately sells it, is its characters and story. It's rare for me to actually connect with anime characters on such an emotional level, because it's rare for me to see anime characters that remind me of people I know. Yes, some things about the people in NHK are blown up to a ridiculous degree for dramatic purposes, but holy shit, Sato reminded me so much of myself during my depression-phase it wasn't even funny anymore. I have friends who talk and act like Yamazaki, I knew a girl once who was very much like Misaki (and people who know about NHK's plot know how well that relationship turned out). The fact that the novel as well as the anime are grounded in reality like that, without loosing their respective anime-edge of occasional fanservice-moments (though presented in a completely different light than you might expect) just works so amazingly good. And I like the fact that GONZO did not add some shitty ending to the series but finished it the same way the novel ended. Unlike the manga, which took everything I mentioned above about \"stuff being blown up for dramatic purposes\" way too much over the top and turned everything I liked about the novel and the series into shit in favor of a yandere-storyline that, ironically, felt as tacked on as a lot of GONZO's endings. So, good job there, GONZO! And as for you guys: stay the hell away from the manga, read the novel instead.\\n\\n\r\nWelcome to the NHK is, in my opinion, a must watch for everyone who's even remotely interested in otaku culture or good character drama in general. It's sometiems incredibly funny, sometimes incredibly sad, but always eager to show you exactly what you came here for: characters in emotional peril who try to seek a way out, and behave really fucking stupid while doing so. Just as I did back then and just as I do nowadays from time to time. It's firmly placed on the second spot of my favorite anime of all time and it shall always stay there until I forget everything about Trigun (which, I hope, will never happen).\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, everything's going to be at least okay.",

            "content": "\"This... is a Conspiracy!!\"\r\nAccording to facts, 90% of a person's life is spent in pain, sadness and suffering, while the other 10% is spent in enjoyment. However, for some people, their life is a total crapfest, and they don't really have that many enjoyable moments, causing them to become hikikomori, which means they shut themselves out of society as much as possible. Welcome to the NHK was a very interesting anime. I had found it on Amazon, it happened to be part of the S.A.V.E. collection, going at less than $15, so I bought it and started watching it. I had no idea what itwas about or if I'd even enjoy it or not, but I'm glad to say that I actually did enjoy it. It had some good comedy and a pretty interesting (if not confusing at times) plot. So, without further ado, let's get this review started, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nI just stated that the story was interesting, but also confusing. Like a lot of good animes, you can't expect the story to make sense the first time you watch it (Steins;Gate, Higurashi, Bakemonogatari, etc.), but for the most of it, if you pay attention to every word spoken, it might be a little easier to understand. In other words, this isn't an anime you should multitask to. Anyways, this anime is about a man in his early 20's who goes by the name Sato. In college, he had started to believe that everything that had been happening to him had been the work of a conspiracy. Not just any conspiracy, the NHK (Nihon Hikikomori Kyokai). He drops out of college and becomes a hikikomori, living in his apartment, going outside as little as possible, and frankly not giving a damn about anything in the world. He then meets Misaki, a girl who wants to save him from being a hikikomori by teaching him how to be \"normal\". Then comes Yamazaki, an otaku living right next door to Sato, who turns out to be an old friend from high school. Together they agree that the two of them will create the greatest \"Gal Game\" on the planet (by Gal Game I mean Hentai Game). Over the series, Sato goes through many problems, and how he deals with them is the most entertaining part.\\n\\n\r\nWelcome to the NHK was animated by Gonzo, known for associating in the creation of the Rosario + Vampire series, and Samurai 7. They aren't my favorite studio based off of some of their previous work, but frankly I really, really liked the art in Welcome to the NHK. It reminded me a lot of some of my favorite movies like Summer Wars and The Girl who Lept Through Time. It felt similar to me. However, the OP animation was nothing to sneeze at. While I enjoyed the song, the animation felt a little sloppy. However, I feel like Gonzo did a really good job this time around.\\n\\n\r\nI was expecting the worse when it came to the voice acting, but I was pleasantly surprised once I heard Chris Patton and Stephanie Wittels playing the main characters. You might remember them from other animes, like Chris Patton played Greed in FMA: Brotherhood, Keiichi in Kanon (2006), and, my personal favorite, Tomoo from Elfen Lied (the kid who gets brutally murdered by Lucy in the scene with the puppy at the school), and you might remember Stephanie Wittels as Kano from Air or Kouko from the Clannad series. Then we have some other crazy good voice actors like Greg Ayres, Luci Christian, Monica Rial and for a brief time David Wald. I liked how they played their characters, and I really laughed at some of the dialog. The smallest jokes made me laugh my head off, and part of that is because of the way that the actors said it.\\n\\n\r\nNow it comes down to the characters. While all of them made me laugh a lot, I can't really say that there were many that made a big impression on me. My favorite character out of the bunch was probably Misaki for certain reasons that I can't really explain. I liked her way of thinking, and it made me happy to see her come on the screen. As for Sato... all I can really say is that he's pretty much an idiot. I don't hate him or anything, but I definitely wouldn't call him a favorite by any means. I get that he's an \"indoor\" person, but all his talk about conspiracies and the NHK got on my nerves. \"I dropped my food on the floor... IT'S A CONSPIRACY OH LORD SAVE ME!\" Really? Then there's Yamizaki, the super otaku. His room is the single reason that I liked him a lot. He's in anime paradise. The only thing that might have made it better was if all of it wasn't hentai games and manga. But he was a really funny character, but he snaps way too often. Overall I wasn't entirely impressed with the characters, but I think it kind of fit well with the series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the series. I'll be honest here, I was hesitant to watch this at first. I bought it because I knew it was a good deal and that I'd eventually watch it, but I think the thing that made me want to continue watching was a part in the first few episodes where he played a Hentai Game for the first time and he kept getting the \"Manly Love\" ending. I was laughing so hard that it got hard to breath and my side started hurting. His reaction was so beautiful that I couldn't resist in watching the rest of it. Overall, if this sounds like something you might enjoy, then I would recommend it for sure. I can't say that this anime isn't for everyone though. Despite how funny I'm making it out to be, there were some moments that either got me bored or depressed. It might be a comedy, but it's not like that the entire series. Either way, I will be showing at least the first episode to a few of my friends to see if it piques their interest.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

The characters all face personal problems ranging from mild to serious, whether they are financial, emotional or psychological. Inaddition, majority of the characters suffer in their social encounters with strangers, allowing them to be directly involved with each other.

At times, it can be perfectly timed and downright hilarious or when used inappropriately during tense and emotional situations, it can be obtrusive and distracting for the viewer. Some important scenes lose that certain passion, that strong feeling that should take hold. Essentially, certain dramatic elements are lost. In the end, it detracts from the anime as a whole as these moments of humor could be better spent developing character and more importantly, character relationships. Consequently, NHK ni Youkoso! falls just short of greatness; when the series finally comes to a close, there is a feeling of missed opportunity.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, that is not to say that NHK ni Youkoso! fails at being a drama, since that would be incorrect. This series is definitely one of the more emotionally charged series&rsquo; of 2006. As Tatsuhiro goes through his daily life, the viewer can easily feel more attached to his struggle as it is very real and down to earth. While not boasting a huge cast, the secondary characters are also well developed and add the extra punch to an already deep plot mired with blood, sweat and human pain. Very often, a viewer can find themselves angry, happy or sad with Tatsuhiro&rsquo;s progress with Misaki, his friends and family. A testament to the gripping realism of this series.\\n\\n\r\nNHK ni Youkoso! is an entirely unique way of bringing the anime world a &ldquo;slice of life&rdquo;. This is definitely a fun and dramatic series, featuring a great opening theme entitled &ldquo;Puzzle&rdquo; by Round Table. Sprinkle the great characters, slap on the realism and just a dash of humor creates a recipe that everyone can enjoy. If you are looking for an anime drama that is out of the ordinary, then, there is only one answer: We Welcome You&hellip;Welcome to the NHK! And enjoy the ride! You will not regret it.\\n\\n\r\nWriiten by AlterGenesis-X\\n\r\nDecember 27, 2006",

            "content": "Is it me or each and every show nowadays is the same unwatchable moe shit?Honestly this moe invasion makes me want to give up on anime altogether. I can't seem to recall a GREAT anime in the last 5 years or so.But as i was ready to blow my brains out from boredom i came across Welcome to the NHK,and my faith in anime was restored.\r\nThe show features the exploits of Sato,a 20-something shut-in who is so afraid of conspiracies plaguing the world,he refuses to leave the safety and warmth of his crappy apartment.As you might imagine,there are no conspiracies,but he is certain they exist.Everythingis a conspiracy.The noisy neighbor who plays anime theme songs louder than Motorhead,the people that laugh at him if he takes a walk,and pretty much everything else,is a conspiracy.\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to my big point.Why stay there and not take it to the extremes and stay in your apartment for your whole life?Sounds good to me.And while we're at it,why not more otaku follow Sato\u2019s lead and never go out in public.Even better than that stay away from the internet.The world would be a better place if fat,sweaty,pedophilic otaku would not contact the outside world in any way,shape or form.\\n\\n\r\nSato then meets a cute young girl called Misaki,and it was love at first sight.She thinks he is a shut-in,so in an effort to show her that he\u2019s not,he blatantly lies to her,which leads to a series of lies,which is the base of the story.He eventually meets up with an old high school friend,and together they form a company to develop a dating-sim computer game.While they work on the game,Sato also deals with his fear of conspiracies,and struggles to form and maintain a relationship with Misaki....My description sounds kind of boring but for the most part really that\u2019s all there is to the plot.The episodes,however,are a crazy mix of comedy,drama and human interactions.We are given a fascinating glimpse into the life of otaku.Maybe we laugh at them for their ineptitude in social situations,we relate to them in their attempts to collect merchandise related to their favorite shows and we feel pity for them as they struggle with daily life and make progress only to slide back again all at once.\\n\\n\r\nWelcome to the NHK is a great character study,and an excellent example of how to balance comedy and drama.Too many shows these days are \u201cslice of life\u201d which is otaku shorthand for \u201cno plot\u201d..Welcome to the NHK shows that you can still get a slice of someone\u2019s life contained within an overarching plot.To do anything less is just lazy storytelling and people that enjoy those types of shows are lazy too.You know who you are,you fuckers.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of this series progresses at a moderate pace,and the best part is that it reaches a natural conclusion.Nothing is forced and we are left at the end knowing that their lives continue on.We just got to see them for a short part of it.There is growth,but not enough to make it unrealistic.We ARE talking about otaku,after all.\\n\\n\r\nThe most amazing thing about Welcome to the NHK\u2019s quality,is that it was created by Gonzo Animation or The Worst Animation Studio the World has ever Seen.Gonzo has a certain knack for taking great ideas and making them horrible.It seems like every series they make starts out good and turns to wretched shit by the end.Their specialty,though,is supplanting plot for shitty CGI.This series,however,featured none of the usual Gonzo touches.There was very little CGI.The animation quality did jump around a bit,but for the most part it was good enough.There weren\u2019t a lot of action scenes,so things usually looked fine.The idea was cool,and they didn\u2019t break away from it.And somehow,the plot managed to reach a satisfying conclusion.I fully expected Gonzo to fuck up the last episode and ruin the entire series as a whole,but they didn\u2019t.They came through and made a quality series.In fact,I would say this is the best series Gonzo has ever produced.\\n\\n\r\nOverall,Welcome to the NHK is a great anime.Lazy assholes who like plotless \u201cslice of life\u201d series will hate it,and pedophilic otaku who like moe shit will be bored by it.However,for all of you other anime fans out there(I can\u2019t be the only one),this is a series that should be watched.\\n\\n\r\nWhy isn\u2019t this series more popular?It\u2019s a conspiracy!",

But boy, oh boy! The hikkikomori condition of Satou-kun was unbearable at times and I couldn't help but sympathize with the characters. It was one of those anime where after finishing you start to ponder about life. \r\nIt left a hole in my heart when I finished it. I could think of nothing but this anime to the point where I couldn't focus on my test. It was thatintriguing.

            "content": "At first NHK is a cute comedy in which a young girl, Misaki, tries to save a guy who`s secluded himself in his room, and can no longer function in society. The allowance reliant, defunct Satou gets himself involved with one taboo hobby/obsession after another, all in a hilariously misguided attempt to pull himself out of his shut-in lifestyle.  The situations try to tickle the funny bone in a dark way.  In one instance, a terrible misunderstanding gets Satou unwittingly caught up in a final hoorah of a suicide group.  Thinking it a vacation, which is an especially exciting treat for someonewho's been shut in his own room for a few years, he's completely giddy amongst a group of hopelessly depressed people.  As the situation becomes more serious, a certain guilt sets in.  I feel bad for having laughed earlier, and Welcome the NHK is the first Anime that has ever gotten such a reaction from me.  With each trap he falls into, Satou always gets dragged to depths of the problem.  He seems to have every character flaw in existence: his self loathing makes him a hair trigger away from suicide, his need for escape and his hatred for reality make him uncontrollably addicted to an MMO, and his gullible nature makes him easy prey for a pyramid scheme.  It's all in good fun the way he so easily gets pulled into so many bad situations, but when it takes him into the darkest parts of his already miserable life, I can't help but cry for him.\\n\\n\r\nIt may be easy to pass off the characters in NHK as severly diseased persons in need of 2 anti-depressants and an anti-psychotic, but they are in every other way relatable human beings.  Most of us probably can't see ourselves becoming addicted to ero-ge's after playing them in the name of research (not to Satou's degree anyway), but the characters themselves understand their own flaws, and even hate themselves for it.  Were it not for that fault, an inability to socialize for example, they would be perfectly functional members of society.  Conversely, with such a fault, it's easy to imagine any normal person in that same predicament.  What seems to be a comic exaggeration of Satou's vices reveals itself to be a great draw for sympathy.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a gradual shift in the tone of this series from a dark comedy to a dark drama.  Misaki's dry speech and rather un-witty sense of humor demonstrate a sweet innocence about her, and when she and Satou's neighbor, Yamazaki, the other bright spot in this Anime, sink into problems of their own, Welcome to the NHK removes humor altogether.  Satou's problems, which have been compounding throughout the whole series, explode as the friends that have been such anchors for him reveal pathologies of their own.  It can become a little melodramatic, but fittingly so.  While a \"the world is ending\" sentiment might not be suitable for a parting between lovers, it seems natural for these characters who genuinely see little meaning in their own lives, and have been keeping in frustrations for so long.\\n\\n\r\nTo note, romance plays quite a role in this story.  A high school crush of Satou's gets pulled in with Misaki to form a very traditional love triangle.  An alluring and mature woman, an innocent and sweet young girl, both vying for the loser of losers?  This sounds like a harem romance, but rest assured, it is so very far from that. To start, neither girl is fighting for Satou.  What looks like a cute, perhaps even generic piece of romantic tension actually stems from selfish, pathological needs.  Its complexity develops because these feelings, however dark their origins, are no less real.  Its dramatic and fitting conclusion, which takes the climax of this series, is at once heartbreaking and heartwarming.  This depraved yet sweet romance is my favorite in Anime.\\n\\n\r\nNHK constantly drops hints for you that behind all the humor, it's actually quite a downer.  The depressing bits, even in the earlier episodes are not anomalies, so take them as a preview of what to expect further into the series.  It gets to be heavy; not suitable for everyone.  If you don't object to the deeply depressing, you'll find something special in Welcome to the NHK.",

The two primary male characters, Yamazaki and Sato, are so thoroughly self-hating and unpleasant that it's hard to care when they endlessly fail at anything they attempt. The two primary female characters are utterly undeveloped, although their stories seem vastly more interesting. Misaki finally gets some notice in the last two episodes, but it's all voiceover narration -- too little, too late. Kashiwa Hitomi, easily the most interesting character in the entire show, remainsa cipher. And, in the end I didn't even care about her.\\n\\n\r\nThis show had a lot of potential and it ended up being pretty awful. Even worse, it was dull, like a bad lecture. Ugh.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

It is actually ridiculous and over-exaggerated and its trying too hard. \r\nanother fail for me are the characters. the main character Satou perhaps is a true hikikomori, but I cant empathise with him at all. Misaki is another cliche. I had high hopes for her at the beginning but she just turned out to be pretty much useless and her speeches redundant. Basically her appearance and impact factor in this show was very low. I alsocant relate to how she and Satou developed their relationship as they did. There is no depth at all and I cant feel any feelings for them. In this case they totally fail as lead characters in this show. The only characters I can relate to are Kaoru (hes quite funny and a really smart otaku. I like his VA too) and Hitomi (a side character with the serious psychological problem). Other then that. the rest are blend. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all 24 eps is too long for this anime as it stretched too long and had poor development. I watched this because of the great reviews. In it end it just proved to me that just because the masses likes something, doesn't mean I will. To each his own I guess\\n",

You also need to be educated what exactly is a hikikomori, and how serious this taboo is to the Japanese society. \r\nFor the interest of your time reading this review, I will just copy and paste what exactly it is defined by Wikipedia: \r\nn Japan, hikikomori (Japanese: \u3072\u304d\u3053\u3082\u308a or \u5f15\u304d\u7c60\u308a, lit. \"pulling inward, being confined\", i.e., \"acute social withdrawal\") are reclusive adolescents or adults who withdraw from social life, often seeking extreme degrees of isolation and confinement. Hikikomori refers to both thephenomenon in general and the recluses themselves. Hikikomori have been described as loners or \"modern-day hermits\".[1] Estimates reveal that nearly half a million Japanese youth have become social recluses.  source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori \\n\\n\r\nThis show goes through the psychological development of a hikikomori and the social tragedies that are tied along with it. The show also goes through the reality of mental disorders such as depression, (serious) otaku, paranoia, and other mental health problems everyone can experience. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, this anime will not be enjoyable for everyone because this anime is not about ninja stars, hentai or epic battles. This anime is an intellectual piece of art. \\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat I learned from reading the reviews of people that rated this anime lower then 5: Watching this anime will define your maturity level.",

            "content": "STORY\r\nNHK is a story centering around various social dysfunctions and anxieties and how people cope with them. It handles these issues with surprising delicacy, walking a narrow line between fanboy pandering (\"This is totally OK behavior!\") and knee-jerk condemnation (\"You must be a freak!\"), trying to get to the heart of why a person might go to unhealthy extremes of behavior. \r\nTo get an idea of the show's writing, in an early episode Sato and Misaki are having a conversation where Misaki implies she thinks Sato has no clue of who Sigmund Freud was, so he trolls her by playing dumb and asking her topsychoanalyze a dream loaded with extremely sexual Freudian imagery- she blushes and quickly switches to discussing Carl Jung instead. The script isn't always operating at such an abstract intellectual level, but it does display how NHK can be a bit smarter than the average anime. \\n\\n\r\nART & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nGONZO did a poor job of quality control on this one, the characters don't stay consistently on-model. It's almost so consistently inconsistent that you begin to not notice. Backgrounds are decent and animation is OK, but I can't say the art in NHK is a textbook example of aging gracefully. \\n\r\nSound is pretty good. The English voice acting isn't perfect across the board, but the major characters are well done. The highlight of the music is the first ED \"Baby Human\" which is set to a demented Japanese rock song paired with wacky animation. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to sum the cast up with one line, it would be \"We're all a bit of a mess\".  Every character has their own set of personal problems to deal with: Sato's an extreme recluse, Yamazaki is a often a spaz, Hitomi is emotionally fragile, Misaki has... well that's spoiler territory but there's more to her past than she lets on. As much as the show doesn't compromise on the fact that there are things about these people that are unhealthy and need to change, NHK still treats them like people, not runaways from a freak show. That respect makes it easier to deal with when the show starts dealing with some heavy issues that might hit a little close to home. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\\n\r\nI knew about this show by reputation before I watched it. I can see that reputation is well deserved.",

            "content": "Welcome to the NHK is a great anime. \r\nIt's basically about a 22- year old hikikomori  (a person that perpetually shuts his/herself in and to be isolated  from society) and NEET (not in Employment, Education, or Training) who loves all things manga, anime, and gal-games. He has been in a state of minimal interaction with the outside world for almost 4 years. However, a series of recent developments and chance occurrences in his life lead Satou to interact with a girl who becomes interested in his life,various people from his past,  and other people he meets during the anime. Satou begins tostruggle with trying to change his socially withdrawn lifestyle as these characters continually interact with him. This series in general reflects how Satou struggles with various social difficulties, and how he interacts with various people that come to influence his life, along with simply showing us the various intricacies of the life of a young Japanese man.  \\n\\n\r\nThis anime excels at portraying the every day life of a social recluse. The anime does a very good job at reflecting how difficult it is for shut in people to re-integrate themselves into everyday life. One of the best strengths of this anime is that it is very easy for us to sympathize with Satou. He makes progress in being more sociable, he relapses, he gets sidetracked..at some points he is serious about his social progress, and some points he is not.. he gets get encouraged, discouraged..ect.  In this sense, the anime reflects the very real notion that it isn't a direct and simple path to recovery for many different conditions and ailments that affect  people in every day life. However, I realize it is improbable that everyone watching this series  is a social recluse; to make up for that, Satou and other characters in this anime have various other problems and circumstances that most people in real life can relate to and its fun to watch how these characters work to resolve their issues. The anime isn't just about Satou dealing with his social problems though. In a larger sense, this anime is about life. I know that's a vague way to describe an anime, but there are so many different things that happen in this anime, different scenarios, problems, events, people, and other things it constantly keeps you entertained because of this. The anime shows Satou in situations where he is bored, stressed, angry, confused, silly, and so on in a majority of the episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime is also great in the way it portrays character relationships. These relationships are fleshed out in a way that really gets you to care about the characters. Every person that comes into Satou's life has a unique personality and unique reasons why they interact with him. Satou's relationships with the two characters he interacts with the most are shown to constantly evolve over time in the series, and their conversations and interactions never stagnate or get old. Characters are shown to question the meaning and validity of their relationships to one another, people move into and out of Satou's life for various reasons, and so on...\\n\\n\r\nYet another reason why this is an excellent anime is that it masterfully blends various elements, like comedy, romance, suspense, and drama. There were moments where I felt very sad, yet there were other moments when I just laughed my ass off (this is especially true for many of the interactions between Satou and Yamazaki, one of the most well-done portrayals of a close friendship I've seen in any anime).  Most of the time you define a show based on its concentration on one of these areas, but not so with NHK. By the time you've finished the series you will have gotten a good dose of all of these areas from multiple characters and story lines to the point where you will feel very satisfied.  If I had to define this anime using a conventional term, I would say slice-of-life, but I use this term cautiously. Slice-of-life seems to imply to many anime fans a slow paced anime with  an atmosphere of nonchalant silliness, along with non-consequential events. It's true that at times NHK can be slow paced and silly, but there are other times where it is extremely dramatic and exciting to watch, and the consequences of the actions of Satou and other people are real and dire. \\n\\n\r\nThis isn't the best looking anime in terms of visuals, but that's not really what is emphasized in the show. At some points we get very detailed environments such as Yamazaki's and Satou's rooms, and at other times were get sort of bland landscapes and not much environmental detail when Satou gets out of his apartment, although this is not to say that the art is terrible overall. It's okay, nothing that would make you cringe from the sight of it or stop you from watching the anime. The art in some cases is actually very creative and colorful in some episodes, especially when you get to see how Satou's thoughts and imagination are animated and mix with his settings in real life. \\n\\n\r\nThe audio is okay as well. The voice actors are great. I watched a vast majority of the series in the original Japanese with English sub, but the dub voices are good as well, ESPECIALLY YAMAZAKI's VOICE ACTOR! One of the rare occasions that I seem to have found an English voice that perfectly fits a character from an anime.  Otherwise, noting extraordinary soundtrack wise. Although I give this anime points for having one of the most unique (both visually and auditory-wise) ending songs I've ever watched/listened to ( for the first season). It sort of reflects how ridiculous/funny Satou's imagination is. \\n\\n\r\nI could tell you more, but it is my belief that my thoughts and opinions may be somewhat lost in an overly long and bombastic anime review. In summary, NHK is most certainty worth watching. I don't believe it's perfect by any means, but it is top-notch. If you want to immerse yourself in viewing the life of a social recluse, or if you just generally wish to watch the various nuances of the life of  a young Japanese man,  you should watch Welcome to the NHK!",

            "content": "NHK\u2019s strength lies in its characters, given the plot is essentially a series of random unpleasant events. What is important is how these events affect the characters and what the characters take from these experiences, which is something NHK portrays quite well. All of the characters are deeply flawed, and while these flaws are usually exploited for the sake of black humour, there are serious scenes sprinkled throughout that force each character to change in some way. The only character that doesn\u2019t completely add up is the lead, Satou himself. Half the time it seems that Satou is only a hikikomori because the story sayshe\u2019s a hikikomori, given the amount of times he\u2019s willing to step outdoors for various reasons. However, one could chalk this up to him wanting to do anything to rid himself of his hikikomori life. And, to be fair, he usually has some degree of indecision before stepping out of the house. He certainly is socially awkward enough to be a hikikomori, though.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as being an adaptation goes, the NHK anime fails to a certain degree. People expecting something faithful to the manga right down to each line will be disappointed. While as much manga as possible is covered in these 24 episodes, the anime treats the material differently. There is a distinct change of tone\u2013 the rather visceral and frantic tone of the manga is severely watered down here, and so are most of the jokes. Because of this the series loses a lot of its edge, thus making it less appealing to those who follow the manga for those elements. This watering down can also been seen in the character designs. Ishihama Masashi, who did the character designs for the anime opted for a more streamlined look to the characters. The designs for the anime is  quite nice and attractive, but almost all of Oiwa\u2019s roughness is gone. It can be argued that the anime designs were trying to channel ABe\u2019s novel illustrations, but this is a bit of a stretch. The anime really has a look of its own.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe one really negative thing is about the romance between the two characters it lacked abit in this section and was going out of place abit and we still never seen them both kiss in the anime which really sucked so yeah overall i'd give it a 7.\\n",

            "content": "When it comes to animes such as \"Welcome to the NHK!\" it's hard to write a review without writing any spoilers because the story is so awesome the only way one can describe it is by retelling it from the beginning to the end. \r\n\"Welcome to the NHK!\" is a masterpiece. When you watch it, you feel as if the characters were really REAL. It's as if it wasn't an anime. That's because NHK is all about everyday life and the issues every one of us has to deal with. Things such as friendship, love, dreams... even death, are all covered here. This anime isextremely emotional and depressive, don't be fooled by the \"comedy\" tag. While it is true that there are lots of funny elements thrown here and there, if you're a young man the chances are that you will share the pain and suffering of the main character - Sato Tatsuhiro. \\n\\n\r\nWhy do we even watch anime? Well some of the people on this website are anime otakus and some are not but whether you're an otaku or just a casual anime watcher, you will more than likely identify yourself with the characters in this anime. And therefore NHK becomes our story, the story of all anime otakus and/or Hikikomoris and what's most shocking is that this anime shows the daily struggles of people like us... or people similar to us anyway. That's why we share Sato's pain and that's why this anime is so emotional. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\n\"Welcome to the NHK\" follows young man, who, like so many young men these days is socially withdrawn. He's afraid to come out of his flat, he's afraid to talk to people - he's afraid of everything that has to do with the outside. He's doesn't have a girlfriend or even a normal friend for that matter. He's a total vegetable, a Hikikomori. He dropped out of college soon after his highschool graduation and has been locked in his flat for nearly 4 years. The worst thing is, he knows what he has to do to change his life... but he can't do it. Until that fateful day when a young girl named Misaki knocks on his appartment door, that is. Shortly after he meets Misaki he finds out that one of his highschool friends, Yamazaki has been living next to him all the time. And from that point on, the story mainly revolves around those three characters, Sato - Yamazaki - Misaki. At times it's hilarious to watch them but in the end, it's all about drama... or shall I say melodrama. Misaki tries to save Sato from his Hikikomori ways, but it's a hard task and there are many twists and turns on the way. \\n\\n\r\n10 points for the story.\\n\r\n----------------------------------\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nThe style is appropriate for this type of anime, therefore I'm not going to expand on this.\\n\\n\r\n10 points.\\n\r\n----------------------------------\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nBrilliant soundtrack, fits perfectly with the anime, especially the guitar solos. \\n\\n\r\n10 points.\\n\r\n----------------------------------\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nLet me say this: the characters are 100% genuine. In fact they're so original and believable, that they could pass for real life people. Their problems are our problems, their life dreams are our dreams, their struggles are our struggles. We connect with the characters because so many of us went through similar situations, from dropping out of college to losing a loved one. Everyone will find himself in this anime, and that's how we, the viewers become the main characters in a certain way. \\n\\n\r\n10 points.\\n\r\n----------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThis is weird, I was depressed while watching \"Welcome to the NHK!\" and I even shed a tear or two but I enjoyed it. If there is an anime series that can make you... well happy and sad at the same time then, this is it!\\n\\n\r\n10 points.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that concludes my review. Welcome... to the NHK!\\n",

            "content": "There are few animes that can be called as \u2018Masterpiece\u2019. Story without flow, beautiful art and music, unique characters, innovative, everything has to be right on track in order to get that status. But there is another factor, if you \u2018learned\u2019 something important through those animes, that can be called as true master piece. You can learn how beautiful our life should be. You can learn what the true meaning of our life is. You can learn what the true joy of our life is. And all the answers are here, in this anime, \u2018Welcome the the NHK\u2019\r\n--------------------------------\r\nHave you ever thought that only bad thingshappen around you? Have you ever felt that everyone, everything this whole world is against you? Have you ever thought that everything happens are already planned by someone and people\u2019s life is already determined from the start? Have you ever believed that \u2018conspiracy\u2019 exists? Have you ever blamed god for those happenings? Have you ever overwhelmed by this huge world and think that your life itself is just tiny tickle of universe? This anime, \u2018Welcome to the NHK\u2019 starts with these questions, and show us the ultimate answers for these.\\n\\n\r\nThe story plot of this anime can be described as \u2018flawless\u2019. Everything is perfectly done. Every single episode had different atmosphere and contents, even though all those stories are connected by one. None of episode was boring; but filled with stories that give you laughs, pity and sorrows. There are lots of smart use of black comedy elements. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime starts with satire, and ends with satire. There are lots of satirical comedies towards the problems in Japanese culture; Hikikomori, Otaku, Suicide, Parental Violence, NEET, Corrupt pyramid marketing, Game addiction, almost all kind of social problems going on in Japan. People who struggles try to convince themselves by saying, \u2018all these happenings are not our fault,\u2019 and blaming gods or conspiracy. \u2018World is full of unfairness, some gets more and some gets less.\u2019 We laugh at those comedies, but there is always hidden truth behind those laughs. We laugh at Hikikomori, but it\u2019s not because they are funny, it\u2019s because they shows \u2018the hidden truth\u2019 of this world. Their constant mentioning of conspiracy looks foolish, but as a view point of those people, it\u2019s the words came out of desperation. Like this, not only those humours make us entertain, but bring us into the deeper aspect of our problems in society.\\n\\n\r\nSince the most of the event was shown from the view point of the \u2018Hikikomori\u2019 main character. Hikikomori, they shut themselves from the public society and have hard time to communicate with other people. They doubt everyone, and believe nothing. They isolate themselves from these \u2018made\u2019 world and blame their life towards those society itself or conspiracy. At this point, we try to find the reason why they try to become alone in this world. Unfairness, Cruelness, Hardness, Tragedies of this world; they are just trying to escape from those factors. Maybe we can call them, \u2018coward\u2019.  \\n\\n\r\nBut then, we ask ourselves, \u2018how about us?\u2019. We also struggle, \u2018life is consist of 90% of pain and 10% of joy\u2019. Maybe this is true. There are not much people who say, \u2018I lived happy life\u2019 when they die. We also blame gods, we also blame this world, we also blame ourselves for being born in this world. Overwhelmed by this infinite universe; and everyone is Hikikomori. They shut themselves from the reality, and dreams of unexpected luck to be happened. Rather than pity towards those Hikikomori, we feel empathy. That\u2019s why this anime is so great.\\n\\n\r\nArt of this anime was just incredible. Although it was not that noticeable, the background art of this anime was amazing; so much details and so much different atmospheres created. Even myself who gets really cocky when it comes to art, hardly ever find any flaws in those illustrations. Character design was also fabulous. It was very consistent compare to other crappy drawn anime like xxxholic. *satisfactory. Well, there was 'SOME' scenes that is drawn extremely bad; but those were pretty acceptable\\n\\n\r\n There was not much sound element going on. Most of the time, it was blank. However, it had great control of keeping the right mood in right timing. OP and ED is simply beautiful; Especially \u2018ABABA ABABA ABABA\u2019 ending by Kenji, who also did ops from \u2018sayonara zetsubou sensei\u2019. SOUND OF GAR~\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development is one of the most essential elements of \u2018Welcome to the NHK\u2019. Let\u2019s start with our Hikikomori Satou-kun. He starts with helpless-pathetic college dropout who has no future. He blames everything to NHK. As time goes on, his symptom gets worse, even with all the help from few of his friends. He is afraid of face \u2018reality\u2019. He believes that everyone around him is mocking him as pathetic loser who has no meaning of life. This is probably most mentally disrupted main character in history, next to Shinji from NGE. It was really entertaining to see how immense changes he experiences during the story goes on. There are other characters with different problems. All those characters are unique themselves, and have own \u2018mental disruptions\u2019. They also shows huge amount of development through the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting of Satou Tatsuhiro was spot on. From his words, we can feel\u2026 so much despairs and desperations. He really, really sounds like pathetic loser. All the other voices were really fitting to those characterisations. Amazing.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy anime? A lot. It was hilarious, but on the other hand, implies very serious elements inside. Everything is perfectly arranged. Story, Characters, Settings, Quality of animation, Voice acting, there is not much flaw I can mention, no I CAN\u2019T FIND ANY. \\n\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\\n\r\nAt least once in a life, we ask ourselves, \u2018why am I living?\u2019. We search meaning of our life, and if there is none, create it. World is unfair, and not all people success. There is always a loser. We blame, that unfairness to god, or other beings. We all have our own \u2018Nihon Hikikomori Kyokai\u2019. \\n\\n\r\nBut, we can\u2019t blame conspiracy till the end. Actually, why are we even trying to find the meaning of our life? It\u2019s already there.\\n\\n\r\nAs long as other people need us, our life will never lose its worth. You think no-one will need you? Wrong. When we die, we will be forgotten, and turns into the dust. Dying now, and dying 10 years later, there is no much difference. Only difference is, you can have time to \u2018enjoy\u2019 your life more. \\n\\n\r\n90% of pain, 10% of joy. Then, just admit those pains. Live for those 10% of joy. Forget your sorrows, miseries, and tragedy. Enjoy your life. Yes, we are all pathetic losers, but admit it, there is nothing we can blame about, because, at least you enjoy your life, we are no longer losers. Face the reality and shout,\\n\\n\r\n\u201cWelcome to the N.H.K.!\u201d\\n\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\\n\r\nYou MIGHT be able to find same review in other place; it's only because that this is not only anime forum I go. So, meh.\\n\\n\r\nAnother, I've NEVER READ MANGA OR NOVEL VERSION of this anime. So, fuck it.",

            "content": "Being a sociologist by qualification and living in Japan, the hikikomori phenomena really makes me think. For that reason, and for actually tackling the issue as the main plot device, NHK got me very interested very quickly.\r\nI finished it in a week, which is very fast for me. I thought it was excellent for the most part, although what initally interested me in the show was not fully treated in the way I would have liked it to be.\r\nStory 8/10\r\nWhat is a hikikomori? No-one in Japan I've spoken to seems to know, and nor does this anime. It's something of a shame for something sobrave as to brand its lead with the affliction, but NHK ni Yousoko can't decide if being a hikikomori is to be lazy, uninitiated, spoiled or a victim of circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nWhat could have been a very intelligent and still witty expose of the hidden Japanese lifestyle becomes at worse a farce, at best a vivid depiction of the mind of a slovenly, shy person. But that's the problem. I don't think that a hikikomori can be characterised so simply into feelings that the majority of us can easily slip into.\\n\\n\r\nOur hero seems to eternally live in the world of the teenager coming to age. His parents send him money to continue living that lifestyle; so he does. I, for one, certainly went through a phase where staying inside smoking and drinking, playing computer games and watching anime seemed a marvelous way to spend the rest of my life. What happened to me, and pretty much what seems forever inevitably happening to the lead in NHK is that I got bored of it. It was unsatisfying and produced nothing.\\n\\n\r\nFor this very reason Satou-kun embarks on various projects to create something; anything. He makes friends (and does so a little too easily to really convince me he is a hikikomori at all), or meets old ones to help him on his way. And they have their problems too, which are certainly not without their charm. The tough issues of the other characters are excellent, and the actually quite dark treatment of several of them cuts like a knife. The lack of 100% happy endings for some is also a brilliant and unpredictable flare of originality.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, like with a lot of anime, the setting and palate somehow don't quite match the mood for the difficult moments in the series. Apart from the soft and quiet night-setting for the troubled Nakahara-san, and the strained and ultimately horrible but nicely crafted worlds of pyramid schemes and suicide-pacts, the series strays too far from its psychological basis (in plot and design). It also has a tendency to peek behind doors to places it isn't equipped to handle, and is ultimately forced to resolve those plot-lines with below par and unconvincingly pleasant outcomes. That's a bit of a shame, but the strengths elsewhere make it excuseable.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 7/10\\n\\n\r\nTo add to what I mentioned about the palate and setting, the animation is sometimes very poor. Whether that is deliberate stylisation, or I just had the raw TV version, I don't know.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the character designs are nice, and the backgrounds and locations are well rendered and believable.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing particularly special here (other than the mighty Odoru Dame Ningen): familiar voices which do a decent job (Japanese), and fairly standard OP and ED. I did like the OP's pleasant balance between Belle and Sebastian and BoA, but it was nothing to skype home about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSatou is clearly the most important character. Maybe I'm missing the point and he isn't even supposed to be a hikkikomori. Maybe that's just his excuse for being so lazy or how he rationalises his lack of social zeal. Whichever way you look at him, he's incredibly interesting. Other characters remain excellent varied creations riffing on the ideas of loneliness, troubled pasts and awkward life-situations. Interestingly the most grounded character, Yamazaki-kun, is the one with the biggest obstacle to overcome - the impossible to over-play pull of Japanese familial responsibilities.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8.8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's pretty clear from the space given to it above that the story is the most important and significant aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nReading back though it seems as if I haven't really given credit where it's due. The series was exceptional in many ways - in addressing the issues it did (which is a very un-Japanese thing to do), being so left-of-mainstream when doing so, and in its murky yet hopeful perception of the world. I loved it, really, which is very rare for such a bitter and horrible person as myself :D\\n\\n\r\nEven when it abandoned the main thrust of the story, took little walks along the beach and played with other peoples kids in a kind of uncomfortable way, afterwards I couldn't help but forgive it. Gonzo created a world so intensely forgivable that it stole my heart. I wanted more but I wasn't angry about it, and that's so close to the ideal way for a series to end that... well, what more is there to say?",

            "content": "ah welcome to the NHK, what more can i say. I'll tell you right now, it might very well be one of my favorite anime. \r\nthe story is about a collage drop-out named Satou Tatsuhiro who couldnt handle life so he shut it out and became a Hikikomori (people who shut themselves in). the plot deals with him coming to grips with reality and learning about overcoming his Hikikomori ways, while learning about himself in the process. the art it great and there are only a few anime that top it, like the sky crawlers or spirited away. \r\ni liked the soundtrack almost as muchas the art, if not more. they do a great job of cycling the background songs in a tasteful, non- repetitive way. they also did a great job placing and fading the music during serious or strenuous moments to animate or enhance the situation. \\n\\n\r\nthe characters were amazing. they were so multi-dimensional that they were unlike the bland, repetitive character types you get from 90% of all anime. they all had serious emotions and problems which weren't fabricated to fit the situations. one thing i particularly liked about the series was the way the characters used humor. the jokes were subtle, just the way i like em' and many of the comical situations were realistic. I'm not saying they could necessarily happen to you or me, but if you were a Hikikomori living in japan who knows.\\n\\n\r\nBy now you've probably realized I'm being very vague but thats only because i don't want to spoil anything for anyone reading this review. i know people usually put those spoiler tags on parts that would ruin anything but we all know that if we're seriously reading the review. . .we'll look. Anyway, id have to say NHK is a solid 10 and at the risk of sounding like a broken record it's one of my favorite anime. so go out or stay in and watch NHK because it doesn't really matter where you watch it. . .every thing's just a conspiracy anyway!\\n\\n\r\nROH ROH FIGHT THE POWAH!",

            "content": "Just finished watching the series and I have to say that it was pretty interesting and unique. Having said that it didn't exactly impress me but it did manage to hold my attention for 24 episodes which is always a good thing, anyway on to the review.\r\nStory (8): The plot was unique alright, the whole premise was pretty zany after all. Overall all it was pretty good but I couldn't bring myself to give it more than an 8 because the plot was inconsistent and didn't really flow all that well in some places. Sometimes it seemed as if NHK couldn't decide if it wantedto be a comedy or a drama but in the end it managed to do a decent job of both.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7): The art was acceptable, well above average but hardly noteworthy. There were no flaws in animation or art that come to mind but neither were there any scenes that just dazzled me with their artistic design. \\n\\n\r\nSound (7): I noticed a lot of repetitive sounds and even some public domain sound effects thrown in from time to time and the music was about average but the voice actors did their jobs well enough. Not the best by any means but they made their characters convincing enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8): Having only four main characters means that there is a lot of time for background and character development. There are lots of animes that seem to forget about this and toss it in at the last moment but NHK does a good job of giving us back story in nice manageable bits and pieces and intermingles it well with the current plot line. The characters themselves were fairly deep and believable MOST of the time but there were a few instances where their actions didn't seem to jive or make sense so they were also inconsistent sometimes. Most of the time however the characters were very well done and could easily be identified with.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7): All and all this Anime was worth it. I have seen better comedies and better dramas but NHK did an acceptable job of making a comedic anime with some dramatic elements in a way that balanced to two genres fairly well. Some parts of the story arcs like the offline meeting and the MMORPG arcs were very enjoyable while others seemed to flounder around until they moved on to the next arc but all and all I would recommend this anime. It wont blow you out of the water but it is worth a look.",

It sheds light into psychological disorders that are currently plaguing our society. There were two subplots that were pretty much the same, and this usually shows exhaustion of creativity among writers. However in Welcome to the NHK, this case was different; it yearned to emphasize that the chances of suicide is high in cases of depression and the like. The help and moral support from other people isindispensable.  \\n\\n\r\nLiving with my brother, who has been a social recluse for 5 years now, I can definitely vouch that Hikikomori is indeed real, and a pressing problem not just in Japan. I like it how the author/s of the story made an emphasis that being a Hikikomori entails financial support, and that once that kind of support is cut, they are forced out of their isolation. This brings me hope that someday, my brother will change too.  \\n\\n\r\nART 8/10\\n\r\nThe art was very good, however there were certainly scenes that were poorly drawn and animated. It could have been better.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 7/10\\n\r\nThe music was good and was capable of setting the mood in the different scenes, although subtle.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters' motives were well presented. There was a great sense of individuality and progression. However, I found the presentation of the main character, Satou, to be lacking. It would have been better to have a better and clear view of his history, which will allow us viewers to speculate on how a Hikikomori is born to the society.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 9/10\\n\r\nIf you like \"thinking,\" and enjoys anime that delves into psychology, slice of life, conspiracy, and even romance, Welcome to NHK is definitely worth a try. \\n\\n\r\nAnime Suggestion: Watamote",

This show doesn't get a lot of action on anime boards and there's very little merchandise available but I think it's one of the better shows of thelast few years and I really enjoyed watching it.

            "content": "Once in a great while, you may stumble across something so great, your one wish is to hold it, cherish it, and keep it forever.  You may want to remember it all the time, look back at it and smile, or experience a warming feeling whenever anything resembling this comes back to you.  Never did I expect to find such a great thing in an anime.  I was blown away, nearly from start to finish, by the mastery of several techniques used, the incredible artwork on the backgrounds, the detail, the very appropriate use of music andsounds and, of course, the impossibly fantastic story.  Now, you may wonder what exactly it is that would make this anime that great, let alone any anime for that fact.  In my experience, having watched some 25 or 30 shows, most of them similar in genre to this series (comedy, romance, slice-of-life, psychological), I have not experienced quite the same response.\\n\\n\r\n     Let me begin by getting aside the things I did NOT like, as that will be quite a short list.  First, there was the way they included that ridiculous looking &quot;kidult.&quot;  I was immediately turned off by the inclusion of such a randomly odd and counter-intuitive creature (what the heck is it??) but by the time I reached the 5th episode or so, I began to understand why something like that would be included.  My second qualm, was merely with the ending.  The series began with quite the introduction, but I felt as if the ending was slightly rushed, mildly pushed, and didn't feel like it wrapped everything up.  Looking back on it, I admit that this is mostly caused by my own nature, desiring to see another outcome from the story (I won't even disclose my own nature, due to fear of giving some spoiler as to what happens).  However, I plan on viewing this show several more times to come, as I feel I missed things (ever watched a movie where the first time through, you wonder what some things were, then after knowing the ending, you can watch for other little nuances here and there?).  \\n\\n\r\nNow, my list of dislikes was short, but I wanted to explain them, as they were only mild and did not take away from my overall experience and enjoyment from this show.  I won't even begin to describe the story, as it was just so fantastic.  I can't even find the words to say in response to what I viewed.  One thing I can say about the story, is that you will often find yourself either a)shouting at the screen, insisting that the characters do something else or b)wondering to yourself why the heck someone would be that dull and not pick up on the hints.  That being said, this story is ripe with bits and pieces of comedy here, drama there, heart-wrenching scenes that made me want to bawl like a little baby, and yes, even some bits of action.  I couldn't believe it (there's a little tour that the main character takes into an online game - Ultimate Fantasy, a lot like Final Fantasy - and there's some cool scenes) that in such an awesome story line there would be something as cool and fascinating to watch as that.  Ultimately, if watching this story, you must make sure you are giving it your full attention, as it would seem that every little piece of dialogue, thought, small scene here, etc, will have it's role in the overall story.  There doesn't ever feel like any discontinuities (there was a mild feel for time, as often a month would pass and you wouldn't know it if you didn't hear a character say that one line &quot;that was 4 weeks ago!&quot;), there never seemed to be any &quot;filler&quot; content, as everything seemed to tie back together very nicely.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the artwork, I'll admit, at times the characters looked a bit odd, but overall, there is some fantastic artwork that makes the feeling of the anime come across very well.  Happy scenes feel very bright and cheerful, whereas sad and dramatic scenes have that... air to them that makes you feel in the mood.  There never felt to be any dull scenes that didn't belong.  The backgrounds were quite possibly the most detailed aspect of the artwork... everything from cigarettes to beer to sheets, beds, bookshelves, dinner plates, magazines... they all seemed so realistically drawn.  It adds a sense that the world is plenty in touch with reality, but the characters at times are distant from it.  Such a nice visual tone.  Other than that, all I can say is just to take a look at it.  My taste in artwork might not be the same as yours, but I found it beautiful, gorgeous and wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it came to sound, this was probably what really drove the overall score up to a 10 for me.  Yes, the story, the characters, the art, they were all super fantastic.  But I grew up as a musician, playing sax, trombone, guitar, piano and clarinet, but more so spending my time in a studio with my brother, recording, setting up and often lending a hand by playing.  So I have a particular taste in music and sound quality.  When I started watching the show and hear the sound of a sliding wooden door, well, that's mostly standard noises.  But then I hear the things like the music playing next door, sounding dull as if it came from next door, the little noises you heard from the aluminum cans, the rustling papers... it's all live sampled sound.  There's no artificial or &quot;created&quot; sound here.  Each noise you hear sounds just as if it was created by it's real life counterpart (including that weird ticking noise of a harddrive when everything is utterly silent).  But beyond sound, the musical soundtrack is phenomenal!  I have only once ever searched for and bought an OS from an anime.  Cowboy Bebop was the first one (Yoko Kanno... wow).  But as for Welcome to the NHK, Pearl Kyoudai, ROUND TABLE, and all the other fine folks involved... wow!  I can't say enough about how fantastic each musical piece sounds... how fitting and proper.  There's a drastic mix of hardcore rock to some smooth jazzy feeling stuff, some acoustic rock, a little bit of folk-styled Italian-feeling music and even the semi-J-pop sounding piece.  Wow, look at me go on about the music.  \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, as for characters, this is where the story is driven, where the tears may fall, where the laughter hits and where the frustration with their incredible ignorance will happen.  These set of people are so... human.  I feel as if I can relate to them all, maybe even knowing some of them personally at some time in my life.  So much life, so much personality... there are times towards the end of the show that you can almost guess what a character will do because you know them so well.  But, as most really great character-driven stories go, the development of each and every one of the main characters (even some of the side ones) is done perfectly.  I never doubted that any of the traits could have existed, and in turn, their direction and path and growth (or recession) is entirely believable and acceptable.  \\n\\n\r\nSo with those categories being reviewed, you may obviously know by now that I was fascinated with this show from start to finish.  I found so much to like in the show that I am for sure going to watch this all over again (probably sooner than I thought, too.)  I watched the subbed version, first, but from what I could tell about the dubbed version (done by Funimation), it is incredibly acted either way, so even more to enjoy now, comparing the original with subs to the dubbed version.  \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this has quickly ascended up there into my top 5 animes, quite possibly tied now with Cowboy Bebop and Ai Yori Aoshi for number 1.  Man... there's so much to like here and so little to dislike.  If you find something that's worthy of mentioning in respect to being bad, please let me know, and I'll gladly view it again, looking for any and every flaw or whatever I can.  \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review!  I hope that this will help you decide on watching this series.  I can tell you, I personally don't regret it at all.  From start to finish, I was in love with everything about this anime.  So what are you waiting for?  Go find the anime and watch it!",

            "content": "NHK Ni Youkoso! is an anime that set new standards for me. And that's saying alot, since up until now, I've been giving plenty of shows 10s and such. However, I know realize what a 10 truly is.\r\nThe reason I was so hesitant to watch this show was probably because I had heard so much praise about it, my expectations would be unreasonably high. I also heard it was a comedy, romance, drama, and psychological anime all at once. Could you really put all that together? Surely it would have been an ambitious task, but in the end it felt right.\r\nRegarding the plot, it wasn'tthat the story was not good, rather it was honestly not that important. The only \"story\" that was worth paying attention to was the growth of all the characters, namely Tatsuhiro Sato. The plot seems to be divided into little arcs (maybe that's how it was in the novel?), sometimes introducing a new character, or a new phase in Sato's journey to end the hikikomori lifestyle. The atmosphere also changes respectively. \\n\\n\r\nWhile on the topic of atmosphere, it seems that this was what made me enjoy these series the most. It starts somewhat lightheated, and becomes darker slowly and very gracefully. The dialogue, the facial expressions, the art styles, music, and the shots and cinematography work together so harmoniously (example, I really thought the choppy, slightly warped moments during the arc with Megumi's brother suit it perfectly, and the recurring mental breakdowns made me pleasantly uncomfortable). \\n\\n\r\nThe OST is also really good, with the best pieces featuring Yui Makino, Pearl Kyoudai, along with compositions by Masao Fukuda. Both the opening and its remix were also good.\\n\\n\r\n On the animation quality itself, it wasn't infested with CGI, but unfortunately it still had choppy animation Gonzo is known for (although it really worked for certain scenes in an odd fashion).\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to tell you anything about the characters. This is due to a.) Doing so would require me to pretty much write a book, and b.) you need to experience it for yourself, since this I think is the defining point of the series.\\n\\n\r\n I think it is pretty obvious that I loved this show, so I'm giving it a 10. It will be an anime where I'll actually remember the names of the characters, consider reading the original source material, and maybe even download a few pieces from the OST into my hip hop infested playlist.",

            "content": "Warning : spoilers included and very unrefined design - I rushed this review on notepad  while watching ep 23 of this crappy anime. I felt the need to as there is only one other negative review listed here. \r\nCharacters : 2/10 \r\nThe worst element to this already terrible show. Sato is \r\nthe most detestable character and unfortunately, the\r\nprotagonist in this show. His reclusive, fruitless life\r\nis the product of some obscure and fleeting psychological\r\nanxiety/paranoia that are the core of why he is 22 without a job\r\nand a college dropout, have rendered him incapable of going outdoors.\r\nSadly, this is all rather whimsical, as these supposed\r\nsevere psychologicalissues that wrought this life predicament\\n\r\n are often nullified as he often goes\\n\r\nout when it serves the plot before later reverting\\n\r\non a later episode - again just to serve the plot. These type of regressions really just deteriorates any significance or realism to his ailment. \\n\r\nThe character is also absent of any substance - during his\\n\r\n4 reclusive years at home, apparently he has accumulated nothing\\n\r\nof lingering value or any form of character development, as he knows nothing of games to help\\n\r\nwith his newly introduced friend, Yamakazi's, game development; hasn't magnetised any\\n\r\npredisposition of anger, sadness or remorse; knows nothing of\\n\r\nporn despite living alone with a computer as he sits around seemingly so astonished by\\n\r\nthe above mentioned friend's semi-nude pics; and has amassed seemingly\\n\r\nno gravitation towards any interest. So what character has he developed \\n\r\nduring those 4 years at home? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. He has no depth;\\n\r\nno talents; no convictions; and no morale given that he has no issue exploiting and abandoning\\n\r\nthe only character who has affection for him without giving us any\\n\r\ninsight as to why, on numerous occasions. We gain no insight into this character beyond some\\n\r\ngrazed notion of his delusions of conspiracies that lack any articulation and serve as a tepid\\n\r\ncomedy medium. \\n\\n\r\nAll of the characters in this anime lack any depth or development. His senpai shares\\n\r\nmany of the above characteristics. Conspiracy notions, lack of insight, suicidal over a holiday trip who then\\n\r\nreverts when asked to marry her. Reverts again and asks Sato for an affair. Oh yeah, she also spent a few years playing cards with Sato. Their characters are clearly\\n\r\ndefined and unweavering for the most part. Naturally there is no dilligent effort to understand these characters. Why \\n\r\nwould there be? Their stances are generally 2 dimensional and simply serve as a moral and drama parameter for Sato to conveniently explore.\\n\r\nNot that the protagonist consistently harnesses a moral compass to follow. His character is just without any established direction and overly whimsical.\\n\\n\r\nMisaki is another dull character. She has the cliche, undefined and resolute infatuation with the protagonist against all odds and irrespective\\n\r\nof how badly they are treated. This servers as just a really juvenile approach to appease a target audience with a sense of euphoria that such nonesense\\n\r\nis possible. I don't see how this can be depicted as romance as it is entirely one sided. Despite Sato's unsavoury circumstances, he rejects these opportunities\\n\r\non many occasions. Sometimes he is satisfied with it, sometimes he overlooks it, sometimes abuses it. Not that we gain any insight as to why most of the time. \\n\\n\r\nStory : 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThe story is primarily defined by a series of mini arcs that for the most part don't have too much significance and is very slow paced. \\n\\n\r\nI wanted to blow my brains out after episode 10. From 1-5 the episodes are saturated with decent comedy and a nice premise for the characters hopeful metamorpism. It falls flat\\n\r\nas the comedy progressively deteriorates and when it's established how fatuous the nature of Sato's problems are, given how fleeting and undefined they are.\\n\\n\r\nBasically half the story is trying to build a game that turns out to be crap, Sato developing a gaming addiction and deceptive romance, despite the prospect of a REAL relationship\\n\r\nto offer solace in spite of his 4 years of loneliness. Logic? Not involved. Insight. Not involved. \\n\\n\r\nNext we have the crappy arc of his senpais suicidal arrangement that he gets himself dragged into. He repeatedly states he doesn't want to commit suicide mentally, but follows through with it \\n\r\nto serve the plot. Near the end they are about to jump and yippy  the heroes rush in to save the day and the suicidal group of 5 all have revelations at the time and its established how stupid,superficial\\n\r\nand as is the hallmark of this show, whimsical, their suicidal tendencies were. Oh yeah Sato apparently now wants to commit suicide all of a sudden without warning. Don't worry he changes his mind quickly\\n\r\nafter Misaki yells out to him. Not that this matters. He later neglects her numerous times. No explanation. \\n\\n\r\nThis show attempts to project romance and comedy but falls flat with both rather quickly.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 5/10\\n\\n\r\nRather contemporary. It isn't choreographed in a noteworthy fashion. Doesn't deserve a better score.\\n\\n\r\nSound : 5/10 - meh\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is very repetitive with a very singular design. Most of the time you won't notice it much. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : \\n\\n\r\n2/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPlease do not watch this. I feel bad having to invest even further time writing this. But I strongly feel this anime doesn't deserve any praise. \\n",

            "content": "NHK ni Youkoso! can be simply described as a raw slice-of-life from the perspective of a shut-in NEET. It showcases the daily fortunes and misgivings of Sato Tatsuhiro, layered upon a background of crippling social anxiety and complications of his \"hikikomori\" condition. As the cast expands, viewers get introduced to their character through unique problems and situations that collide and intrude within Sato's own situations.\r\nI personally can say that I had an enjoyable time watching this anime. It is a break from the many fantasy shows and action-packed anime present in every season, and it actually forced me to look at things with a differentperspective. Softening no punches, the underlying themes in the show provide a raw commentary on present-day society, even if it is a message crafted nearly 13 years ago. Each character has their own unique backstories and personalities, which makes an interesting watch to see how they interact with both Sato and the obstacles thrown at them throughout the series. The outstanding soundtrack also helps with the viewing experience of the show, seemingly providing the best suitable music for every scene, whether happy or melancholic. Some soundtracks make you want to jump up and down in happiness, and others entice you into contemplating your life. It is this severe contrast in emotional tone in the OST that enables the abrupt change of atmosphere this anime often employs while amplifying the psychological impact of its interwoven messages.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this anime also has its own misgivings. The biggest problem so far is through its unremarkable art. While the quality is from 2006, its art elements are fair, with some episodes showing more flaws than others (I would say that episode 19 is the worst in the series in terms of artistic presentation). Also, the plot lines follow a somewhat predictable, but cliff-hanger filled and surprising, story line, through the gradual character development of Sato - and others as well - made as the show progresses.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, with its flaws both in the art department and the story line, this anime remains one of my favorites through its brute commentary of present social problems, underlying themes and messages laid throughout its story arcs, and outstanding OST that perfectly encapsulates this anime's roller-coaster of emotions.\\n\\n\\n",

But this, this anime with its terrible art, an arc I absolutely despise, and an ending that leaves even me feeling unsatisfied is unlikely to be dethroned as my favorite for a long time.\r\nYes, the art is often bad. Close-up shots look consistently decent for the most part, but whenever a character's face isn't the sole focus of a shot the art starts to deteriorate. BUT, get this, the soundtrack is of legendary quality. It's something that few other anime live upto. An entirely original soundtrack, which you will come to recognize. Particularly masterful is the use of the instrumental version of Hitori Bocchi over the course of the anime, and then hitting you with the vocal version near the end, when it hurts the most. And, if you're the right audience for the anime, it will hurt.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really want to go into any more specifics than what I've already said. Just know that if this anime sounds interesting to you, sounds like something that you could identify with; you will. The anime may just become your favorite, in spite of itself. \\n\\n\r\nTo all the potential loves that time forgot, to the people who tried hard but failed anyways, to the people that one day managed to pick themselves up again, with no promise of life getting any better, this is a love letter.",

            "content": "So I have written a review for this before but I felt it was kind o'poopy. SO! Here we are again. Approaching NHK was like when you go to watch a movie at the cinema where you know it's gonna try and mess with your head and your feelings, but you go to see it anyway. Sometimes they get it hella wrong, but in NHK ni Youkoso! they hit the mark perfectly. It's always easy to slip into a dreary, and fairly dull storyline when you talk about the themes of depression, suicide, self-worth and in this case a hikikomori. But somehow they manage toadd a depth to it, unlike I've seen in a majority of anime. It becomes more of a cinematic piece rather than a show, and here's why.\\n\\n\r\nNHK ni Youkoso! slams you straight into Satou's world (the main character). You don't need to have prior knowledge to the world he's in because you see it, and they make you feel it through a mix of imagery and story telling. Nothing in the world is as it seems with Nakahara becoming more and more troubled and interesting as the story progresses. It doesn't force a romance down your throat, it allows you to interpret it as you will. You feel like their issues are real, and that they can't just solve them with a click of their fingers, and if you know how they feel then you can understand it even more so.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is quite unique, adding to the feeling of unease and struggle throughout. Even though you're watching from an outside perspective, the art really does push you into their reality of despair and loneliness. NHK ni Youkoso! takes you through the lives of these people, and at the same time fills you with sadness, joy and laughter. I honestly feel honoured to have watched it, and it certainly has stayed with me since.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\r\nBob",

            "content": "Studio Gonzo doesn\u2019t exactly have the best reputation in the world. This is largely due to the fact that most of their shows are schlocky adaptations of incomplete seinen manga with inconsistent animation and jarring CGI. That being said they have cranked out some acclaimed titles, one of which is a little psychological drama/black comedy from 2006 that has been heralded by many as being one of the best of its kind. Yep, that anime is Welcome to the NHK. \r\nThe story revolves around a dude named Satou who suffers from severe social anxiety and thus chooses to live his life as a hikkikimori. Forthe uninitiated, \u201chikkikimori\u201d is a Japanese term for someone who very seldom leaves their place of residence. He has lived like this for four years and has attributed his isolation to a conspiracy called the NHK (yeah, the well-known Japanese TV network). Our story begins when he meets an enigmatic young girl named Misaki who wishes to \u201ccure his hikkikimori ways\u201d through a project she has set up. He also ends up meeting some figures from his past including his game-obsessed friend Yamazaki and the eccentric albeit depressed Hitomi. Hijinks and misadventures ensue. \\n\\n\r\nThe show has various arcs, all of which tackle different social issues in Japan including suicide pacts, online game addiction and network marketing scams. The series showcases the causes and effects of said issues wonderfully and with a lot of poignancy. That being said there is also a good dose of levity in the form of dark humour thrown in but the show manages to balance the drama and comedy well so as not to make the show tonally jarring or mean spirited.\\n\\n\r\nThe core theme of the plot is the seemingly absurd and pointless nature of existence. The show explores this theme excellently as none of the events are instigated by our protagonist but he is instead dragged along for the ride due to circumstance. This may sound quite depressing and at times it is but the show manages to deliver a positive and uplifting message at the conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s characters are an interesting bunch to say the least, especially our protagonist Satou. He\u2019s an erratic albeit cynical and intelligent guy. One of my favourite parts of the show would be his development. Instead of developing in a conventional manner through drastic growth he does so in cycles, and said cycles are influenced by the interactions and influences of the other characters. \\n\\n\r\nAnother character of note would, of course, be Misaki. She\u2019s initially very ambiguous and said ambiguity really helped generate interest. Over the course of the show facets of her personal life and backstory are revealed and often subtly foreshadowed until we eventually get the whole picture. In spite of the fact that she attempts to help our protagonist get out of his rough patch she too is heavily flawed. It is through interaction with Satou that she develops as a character and vice versa. In fact the influence these two have on each other is the crux of the narrative. Their changes due to said interactions are both positive and negative, and this all eventually culminates in an incredibly cathartic and engaging climax. \\n\\n\r\nAll the other characters are great too as they all influence each other\u2019s growth and development and have interesting and often emotionally engaging backstories which really make the viewer understand why they are the way they are. \\n\\n\r\nAs I already mentioned animation and art aren\u2019t exactly Studio Gonzo\u2019s strong suites and it definitely shows. The quality constantly fluctuates throughout. There are times when it looks really good and other times when the characters lack a significant amount of detail. That being said I particularly liked the choices of colour and imagery during Satou\u2019s hallucinations as they evoke a surreal and bizarre atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s soundtrack is really good. Most of the tracks are guitar pieces which are often either somber or lighthearted in tone and fit their respective scenes to great effect. The show\u2019s opening was really good too but I personally felt that the first ending track stood out most. It\u2019s unconventional, odd, catchy and the lyrics, while very out there and bizarre, are thematically pertinent to the plot in some ways. That being said the second ending track was fairly forgettable though it did compliment the more depressing episodes rather nicely.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion Welcome to the NHK is many things; funny, poignant, unconventional, beautiful (albeit not aesthetically), engaging, weird and depressing. This was a show that really hit home with me and is a fantastic tale about human flaws and the ability to change as people. If you haven\u2019t seen the show, make a note not to miss it.\\n",

            "content": "Welcome to the NHK indeed.\r\nStory - Fact of the matter is, It took me a while to grow to respect this series for what it is. I gradually heightened my score until it hit the nice round 10. Let's be honest, nothing deserves a perfect score, but some certainly deserve there accolades. NHK is just so different then any other anime I've seen in the sense of how truly freaking depressing it can be. \r\nThe show starts slow and it may be hard to grab on.. but you may find at least one of the moments of the show will strike a chord deep your\"heart (metaphorically of course)\". The show tackles many issues all humans face every day and it really doesn't take them lightly even though it may seem so at times. The thing about the show is it doesn't seem to be trying to preach anything, it's not saying with a recluse/otaku is bad or not. It is however helping one to explore such worlds - possibly worlds you didn't no existed or knew very little of. \\n\\n\r\nSadly shows like this may get passed by because, ironically the characters themselves participate in this, escapism. It's a big reason why people watch/read ANYTHING fiction related, to escape. Is this bad? That's for one's self to decide and unless your so interested in my opinion your welcome to PM me =P. \\n\\n\r\nBack to what I was saying, this show is not void of comedy however it is certainly dark in many aspects. Some may go into the show thinking about the NHK the entire time and believing it will lead somewhere, sorry but it's really only metaphorical. WTNHK is a deep and dark anime unlike possibly anything you may have seen before, it may tear up some and may not but it certainly is something that should be seen. Lets face it, don't we all just want to live in a fictional world?\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt- I'm not really a great judge of animation but to me as long as it doesn't distract me it's doing a good job, so I'd say its pretty good - 9.\\n\\n\r\nSound - I really loved a few of the songs that are played, especially the guitar instrumental often played, which is rare as I tend to not notice sounds in Animes, but it fit well. - 9\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-  One of the toughest parts about this anime is the characters may not be easily likable. They can quickly become reflections of one's self. They certainly are far from adorable or may even remind you of people you know. They're pain does however feel real and that's how it should be for such characters. There can be moments when you may get irritated at some of the poor decisions with them but you'll get over it. Overall they do what needs to be done.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - It's hard to thoroughly \"enjoy\" a depressing narrative, it tends to be more something that one can walk away with new ideas. It's just not really something that can be rated in this instance. It will doubtfully be life changing but that doesn't mean you can't take something away from it - personally that's what I do with everything I watch/play/read =).\\n\\n\r\nOverall - It may not be for everyone and even for those that do watch it you may regret it. But regretting something tends to be better then wondering what if :P.",

            "content": "So this is at episode 7, and I will update this when I finish all the episodes, or when I decide to update it if there's a point I need to.\r\nNHK ni Youkoso! has made me realize that I need to shape up. The lifestyle I'm slowly progressing to is the same as the main character's: sleeping 12+ hours, rarely leaving room, college getting difficult, no job, etc. and I suppose this show was actually a wake up call. This show is my figurative \"Misaki.\" \r\nI haven't gotten to the point where I start blaming my short comings, unluckiness, or general bad things on conspiraciesthough, so I've got that going for me!\\n\\n\r\nI will say, some of the negatives of the show before praising it, so here we go:\\n\r\nThere's something missing graphics/art-wise. That's really it.\\n\\n\r\nNow, onto the good things:\\n\r\nAll of the characters are developing well. I enjoy how Satou, the MC, progresses. I like the flashback dreams he has, it gives a little bit of the introspection behind everything, and it really does add to the overall story.\\n\r\nAt first, I wasn't a fan of Yamazaki. He seemed like the stereotypical otaku, besides being rather in shape, and didn't really have any defining characteristics, except that he blasts annoying music constantly through the paper thin walls into Satou's apartment. What an annoying bastard, right? Well, as the story moves on, and you hear his struggle with his parents on the phone, or when you uncover the lies he tells people, he's someone that you almost pity. Somewhere along the lines, you start to like him, and he grows on you. It's just something that happens.\\n\r\nMisaki on the other hand, started out with a bang, in a bad way for me as well. It wasn't until the episode where she starts talking about psychology and Freud that I began to like her. I haven't gotten too far with the series as of now, so this part will be updated with more contact with her in the future episodes.\\n\r\nA story can only be as good as it's characters in my opinion, but it gets an added point because I like the concept of the anime. \\n\r\nBesides the characters and story, the sound is great. I like the alien-ish voice effect used through a few of the episodes, and the background music is something I can really enjoy. There's a few classical piano backing tracks and it fits in phenomenally well with the anime. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I honestly don't expect too many, or really any, \"helpful\" review hits just based on the fact that I've only seen a quarter of the show. I just wanted to start writing because this show is pretty interesting. I hope that if you do vote now, you check back again and reread it once it's updated. Thanks.\\n",

            "content": "This review contains minor to moderate spoilers.\r\nI chanced upon this anime while I was browsing a social anxiety subreddit. A user had shared a link to one of the scenes. It was two snapshots of a bespectacled man, and on the bottom of the screen it was captioned \"A drama has a logical progression, outbursts of emotion, and a resolution. Our everyday lives are just filled with nebulous and vague anxieties forever and ever.\"\r\nIntrigued, I began to embark in a great journey. Anime has taken to me to many worlds, fascinating, reality-shattering, deathly frightening, but this anime was different. It was not inspiring.\r\nWelcome to theNHK is about Tatsuhiro Sato - a hikikomori - someone who doesn't attend school or work and lives off another's income. He lives next to the easily irritated and passionate closet otaku Yamazaki, who acts like both an advisor and a depression-buddy to Sato. He's eventually visited by a level-headed and strangely eager girl, Misaki, who offers to counsel Sato to help him escape from his current condition. Sato thinks that some huge corporation - the NHK (Nippon Hikikomori Kyokai, a play on NHK, the Japanese public broadcasting station) - is out to get him. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is told in a loose arc structure. A couple of main characters are introduced and developed, and then the side characters come in to mess with Sato for a few episodes before vanishing. The setting is mainly focused around Sato's cluttered and disgusting apartment, but once in a while he leaves the house and some huge event befalls him. What's interesting is that I never felt that the \"home\" episodes were lackluster. What the episode lacked in the inherent interesting-ness of the content, it made up with detail, sweet and bitter detail. We see the characters make a video game, talk in a park, listen to a shoujo anime opening, roll around in bed hallucinating. You can get a kick trying to analyze the small events that happen, and maybe find something valuable about character development. Like most good stories, clues are left for people to take. NHK is not an action anime, or at least the action is deeply internal. I always found myself evaluating the characters' emotions and linking them with whatever just happened. That's one of the enjoyable aspects of this show. \\n\\n\r\nI liked most of the characters; I particularly endeared myself to Yamazaki and Sato, in whom I see many of my problems and worries reflected. The characters aren't archetypes. Sato isn't a hero, merely a broken man with human desires. Yamazaki's somewhat of a comedic sidekick, but he isn't there for slapstick humor or to highlight the protagonist's differences. Misaki isn't a sex symbol, a tsundere, a yandere, a kuudere, or some other dere. My main criticism would have to be \"the boy and girl meeting each other and turning around each other's lives\" trope. I just wish that we could see someone solve their problems by themselves. It's because I don't have a magical girl in my life, and I don't want anybody else to have one, haha.\\n\\n\r\nI actually had trouble distinguishing this anime from reality at times, because of how unadorned it is, especially when compared to a lot of other shows out there. There wasn't a main villain, no character to which the majority of the blame could be attributed to. All the characters fight with themselves, others, and the circumstances. Idealism is dead. There isn't any \"pure love\". All the relationships were tinged with the essence of \"love-hate\". No tearful farewells in which the characters forgive each other, fully learn from their mistakes, and start anew on a white slate that is bound to stay clean from now on. That's the stuff of fantasy. As a result, I didn't feel like a crusader when I finished the show. It's too damn cynical. There wasn't a standard to look up to, because the characters are so flawed. But for me, it made me fulfilled to watch on. I took the characters as comrades in a hidden struggle. This is a true slice-of-life, and the faked-up comedy or melodrama is kept at a minimal. I never felt that the anime was manipulating me (except the end), like it never told me to: \"Feel sad now!\" or \"Relish the doom that has befallen the protagonist! Share his dread!\" Some of the high-impact scenes, I felt utter ambiguity, and I didn't know whether to snicker or sit there blank-faced and maybe slightly teary-eyed.\\n\\n\r\nThe art would have to be the weakest point, but the fact that it hooked me, someone who lives off moe and the pretty scenery of Kyoto Animation, it attests to the quality of the story. Sometimes it had the effect of sandpaper on the eyes, but it was never close to unbearable. The art, is for lack of a better word, simple, but I think that it suits the mood of the story fine. \\n\\n\r\nThe openings and endings are decent. They were all very different in style, and it was astute for the composers to demonstrate the facets of hikikomori life: the melancholy, the mania, and the wistfulness. Voice acting is unpretentious and fresh. It never stood out or drew unnatural awareness to itself, which is what good voice acting should do. I also had a faceclap moment when I noticed that Yamazaki's voice actor voiced Sunohara in Clannad.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is the main reason why I loved this anime. More than anything I've ever saw, I related deeply to this anime. No, I felt that the author Tatsuhiko Takimoto probed into my thoughts, not the thoughts that run through your head in words, but your innermost subconscious, the ideas that ring so true to you but seem to never be able to materialize into a defined shape, and legitimized them. Many series have a loner character, but sometimes I just don't feel that the author understands what it truly feels like to be lost in the world (coincidence that Tatsuhiko is almost identical to Tatsuhiro?). This series drives those feelings into the heart of the viewer, during which I hope even the people on the opposite side of the social spectrum can become aware and understand.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this series to those who like me, have struggled with adapting into society. To those who haven't, you probably won't enjoy it as much as I would, but nevertheless it's a poignantly told story.\\n\\n",

            "content": "When am I going to stop loving dark comedy so much? \r\nWhen it stops being so damn entertaining. \r\nImagine an absolute failure of a human being. A twenty-something, college dropout, no job to speak of and no plans to get one anytime soon. Rude, perverted, antisocial. Doesn't leave his house, doesn't even bother to clean up after himself. Probably stinks of good old man-smell. \r\nThat, my friends, is the protagonist of this show.\r\nSato is a \"NEET\", or \"hikkikomori\", whose life is stuck in an increasingly fast pitfall of self-isolation, until a strange girl offers to help him. This alone seems like a pretty contrived premise.A morose manchild stuck in a rut being renewed by a Manic Pixie Dream Girl; we've seen this all before, right? Wrong.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, the comedy is usually spot-on. It thrives on this aura of perverse cynicism. The protagonist, who believes everything wrong with his life is a conspiracy as some sort of defense mechanism, is constantly having these wackjob fantasies that blow anything and everything way out of proportion.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are nothing less than a fucking riot. Sato isn't the only one in the cast with a fatal flaw; almost everyone he meets has something that they desperately need to overcome. His otaku neighbor, and his bitter misogyny. His high-school love interest and her neurotic pessimism. A brief encounter with a young man rotting alone in his room. Even our supposed Manic Pixie Dream Girl, who's supposed to be 'fixing' Sato, has skeletons in her closet.\\n\\n\r\nBut Sato has the most grueling journey of all. Just when you think he has happiness in his grasp, he backpedals away from it. HARD. Despite how despicable and pathetic he can be sometimes, you want him to resolve his problems. Because like it or not, you will see yourself in him. His fears are fears that the viewer can identify with. We want him to find his happiness the way we wish to do so ourselves.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I won't give away the ending, but let me just say this: it's realistic. It isn't a fairytale bullshit ending, but it isn't some downer ending that's tragic just for the sake of being tragic. Which is a proper way to describe this anime in general: real. Because no matter how utterly outlandish it is, it deals with issues we see in everyday society. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I hate to harp on technicalities here, but let me just say. This is a Gonzo production, people. Don't expect outstanding animation here, because you will not find it. At some points it reaches Higurashi-levels of sloppiness. The music is decent, if barely noticeable. The opening is rather standard, and filled with gratuitous Money Shots. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, that never really got to me. I was in it for the story, and in that aspect it certainly didn't fail to deliver. I give this a 9 with full confidence, and I strongly recommend it for people who liked anime like, say, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. \\n\\n\r\nBut who's going to take my word for it? After all, this could very well be a conspiracy.",

            "content": "Failure. Loneliness. Heartbreak. Suicide. Depression.\r\nI'm warning you now, those who are deciding to watch NHK ni Youkouso. You WILL get depressed watching this. I never checked the genres or read reviews anything before watching it, so at first I just assumed it as a fulfilling slice of life comedy with blooming romance, character development and stuff like that.\r\n...It's not. Well, I guess it's a liiiittle bit like that, but at its heart this anime just shows the various miserable lives of the main characters. Unlike other feel-good anime where good things happen, this anime will give you failure after failure. Give you loneliness. Give yousuicidal characters.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't have a very impactful and fulfilling ending. Which will make you depressed even more, after having to endure all these misery for twenty-four episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI guess it's somewhat my fault that I didn't bother to check a lot about the anime before watching it. I just saw it as a recommendation for those who liked Steins;Gate (which I loved). Though I guess there is a lot of drama in S;G too, but at least THAT anime had great romance and a fulfilling and great ending.\\n\\n\r\nThough I guess, it's good at what it does. This anime is all about life, and all the terrible things in it. If you spend a lot of time being alone in your room wasting your life in anime and games, you will relate to this anime. If you had a project that you wasted a hell of a lot of time on and it ends up in failure, you will relate to this anime. If you've had experiences that made you really depressed and even want to commit suicide, you will relate to this anime.\\n\\n\r\nDon't expect this anime to be feelgood and fulfilling. It's funny and charming at times, but that's little compared to the main goal of showing the harsh realities of life. Of a lot of people. This anime has no dramatic and impactful ending; it's just normal and lifelike.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is mostly good, but sometimes subpar and lazy. But the OP and EDs are great, and the soundtrack is really good. It really shows the emotion, it makes you feel more lonely in lonely scenes, more depressed in depressing scenes... Uggggghhh The OP is a lie this is not a heartwarming and charming slice of life comedy romance.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter... They are kinda complex and well-written. You'll really feel immersed, curious, connected with the characters. Well, the characters have miserable lives unfortunately, but NHK is unlike other anime with shallow characters. They're well-written.\\n\\n\r\nSigh. Unfortunately, this anime is just not my thing. Seems like the reason I carried on watching despite being depressed about all the misery after misery and failure after failure is for the belief that it will get better. That it will have a great, feel-good, charming, fulfilling and impactful ending that I will enjoy. Unfortunately, it's still depressingly lifelike until the end. I can see how people like how lifelike this anime is, so if you want to watch an anime about the miseries of reality then watch this. I don't want to make it sound bad because it isn't, it's actually a greatly written anime, but it's just not my cup of tea.\\n\\n\r\nMy gripe, aside from the fact that this whole anime is depressing, is that the main female character almost never changes her clothes. This isn't a school anime, but all I'm seeing is her black and yellow clothes over and over again. I don't know why that makes me angry when I enjoyed stuff like Attack on Titan or Nisekoi. But seriously. For an anime that tries to be lifelike, it's not very normal to have the same outfit everyday for the whole year (except winter).",

            "content": "\"People who neglect to make efforts, or who do not take any actions at all, are always the ones who dream that someday they will suddenly become wildly successful.\" \u2014 Misaki Nakahara.\r\nNo, this anime is not about a pathetic looser who only sits at home, watches TV, plays eroges, and does nothing but it. But we will discuss it later. Before starting my review, I would like to say only one thing: I only watched this anime to hate it, because I did not believe in all that hype surrounding this anime. And I must say that it is understandable; after reading the synopsis ofthis anime the first thought that comes to your mind is that this anime is only about a hikimori that is trying to either live his shitty life, or to change himself. You might also think that \u201cit is another [sarcasm]10/10[/sarcasm] anime about some loser that gets all the booty. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, thinking so would be one big mistake that I would never recommend you to make in your life. I am not going to hide the fact that sometimes this anime might be boring and that there might be parts that will make you want to turn your eyes somewhere else. (The main characters of this anime are trying to make a well-selling eroge). But this should not be the reason for you to not watch this anime, since it is not the main focus of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, enough with this long intro. This anime is not just about some boring hikimori and his nerd friends and this anime is not one of these romances that are obvious as hell. It might be surprising for you, but I want to say one thing that will hopefully make you more interested in this anime: this anime is VERY dark. Of course, I am not going to explain you why, but everyone who has already seen this anime will agree with me. Is it enough for you to watch it? Hopefully, it is. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of NHK ni Youkoso! (Welcome to the N.H.K.) revolves around the life of Satou Tatsuhiro. Satou Tatsuhiro is just an ordinary man that becomes a hikimori one day and finds it more and more challenging to return back to normal life with every day. One day, our main hero comes to the conclusion that his being a hikikomori is the fault of a conspiracy put into motion by the secret organization known as the NHK. In Satou\u2019s mind, the Japanese television station, Japan Broadcasting Corporation (N.H.K.), tries to turn people into otaku in order to then make them hikimori. However, one day, he runs into a young girl named Nakahara Misaki, who claims that she can make him normal again; however, our hero will have to become a part of her \u201cmaking hikimori normal again\u201d program. Throughout the anime, Satou undergoes Misaki\u2019s adaptation program and meets his old friends. And that is pretty the whole story.\\n\\n\r\nYet! This anime, as I have already mentioned, is not simply about a typical hikikomori; this show is a great opportunity to take a look at the life of an individual, who has some big psychological problems. Paranoia, and self-denial are just some of the hardships that Satou faces. But the question is that if he will be able to recover? That is, of course, not the only question that you will have to answer. There are Satou\u2019s friends and that mysterious girl that wants to cure Satou\u2019s paranoia. And here is one thing that is also important to mention, there will be some other serious events that will touch Satou\u2019s friends and that mysterious girl. Believe me, everything is not that easy as it might seem and I am more than sure, I guarantee you that you will not be able to even guess anything in this anime. Please, be patient. I know that this anime might be very boring and awkward, but you should see the whole thing before thinking that it is bad. It is dark, it is very dark! And, perhaps, this anime might become your top 1 favorite anime. \\n\\n\r\nAs for animation, it is, without a doubt, the weakest part of this anime. Do not get me wrong, it is not that bad, but it is not good; it is fine. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound, on the other hand, is great. You will surely find some tracks that will make you smile, or you might even download something for your collection. The cast of this anime also did one hell of a job voicing their characters. However, I would not recommend you to watch it in English. Tastes differ, but it is absolutely obvious that the Japanese cast members did a much better job with this one. \\n\\n\r\nStrongest in this series, what everything is built around, are the characters and it is the only reason for you to watch that anime. The anime mostly revolves around Satou, yes, but at the same time, all other character receive enough development, as well. And it is a one big plus of this anime, because every character of Welcome to N.H.K. has their own story to tell the viewers. On top of that, the show sees the cast as more than just fictional characters; it portrays them as representatives of subcultures they are a part of. You will surely not find a character that will annoy you. All the cast members are well-developed. It will probably take you some time to understand them and their actions, though, but it is worth is. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, you will never guess what this anime will offer you, it is absolutely impossible. And when you find out the gem of this anime, you will surely like it. However, the price for that is that you will have to watch the whole anime, and it might be boring for you sometimes. While Welcome to N.H.K. should have paid more attention to its animation, which is the only huge flaw of this anime, the anime\u2019s characters, sound, and story compensate for it well. \\n\\n\r\nI cannot guarantee you that you will like this anime. If you enjoy psychology and if you like to analyze characters, and to use your brain for analyzing and thinking, I am sure that you will like this anime. Because when you see the whole anime and understand everything, you will have no other choice but to fall in love with that masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nI hope you will enjoy this anime!",

            "content": "After watching 2 episodes of this anime my impressions were - \"WTF!\". But after finishing this anime, I was truly enlightened. This will be my #2 FAVOURITE ANIME EVER.\r\n- Overall / Enjoyment [10] - This anime was something that I was curious about in the start as I had seen it often but never even had a thought about it after watching a few drama, school, romance anime's - Welcome to the N.H.K - was a recommendation and I took a gamble and what an amazing gamble it was. I would recommend this to literally everyone I know ... you too of course.\r\n- Story [10]- This story was so unique that I feel needs its own genre. This is a hidden but not so hidden gem in a field of endless anime's. The story is not ripped off but completely original and had a certain relate-ability to it - that growing fear of change and where life will eventually take you, the representations of these concepts where introduced smoothly throughout the anime. It really is something - as explicitly - the story is a about a Hikikomori NEET trying to figure out his place in life as new obstacles and situations and relationships are introduced to this story. However, implicitly it has a more darker tone to suicide, abuse and depression that are highlighted. \\n\\n\r\n - Character [10] - I love the MC Satou as he's a normal kid that took some wrongs turns in life that ended up making him a Hikikomori. As his life then changes when he meets past friends and new people who try to encourage him change his life while at the same time trying to change theirs. The characters throughout the anime all have some sort of issues and or backstory which made them end up in their present state, each of them are all influenced by the others actions, good or bad.\\n\\n\r\n- Art [9] / Sound [10] - The animation style was quite a classic one but was still able to get across the story. The music fit well the story and it all runs smoothly together.\\n\\n",

            "content": "At some point not too long ago, I randomly stumbled across the synopsis of an anime called \"Welcome to the NHK\". I had never heard of the series before, but for whatever reason, it appealed to me just enough to decide to try watching it. Without doing much of a check on the series, like who made it and other details, I jumped right in with the first episode, which quickly became the first 5 episodes. At first, I was practically trying to dislike it ((I don't see myself as an anime-tard at all)) but it was hard to just turn off. Over a periodof about 4 days, I had finished the 24-episode series, including 11 episodes in one sitting.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I don't regret it one bit.\\n\\n\r\n&quot;Welcome to the NHK&quot; is excellently written, based off a novel that was later made into a manga written by the same author, so there is no reason to freak out when you see the 'GONZO' in the opening credits!!! I admit that before I did research into the origin of the series, I had my doubts when I saw it was made by GONZO. I'm not a fan of their anime, but it seems that when they do an adaptation of someone else's writing, they can really create something special. &quot;NHK&quot; is tightly written and is heavily character-driven, focusing around 22-year old Satou Tatsuhiro, his social anxieties and the people around him, including a teenage girl who wants to help free him of his 'kikikomori' ways. There are few characters to keep track of, making the series extremely easy to follow along with, and the characters are well-flushed out and developed. It also helps that they all turn out to be extremely likable and easy to relate to.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not usually a fan of 'slice of life' anime, but &quot;NHK&quot; will have to be my exception. The psychological aspect of the story tied in with a touch of social commentary creates an interesting and addicting mix.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical side, the music is amazing and adds to the overall atmosphere of the series. However, character animations are rather inconsistent but the backgrounds and environment are beautifully done ((the one thing that we all love about GONZO anime)).\\n\\n\r\nAlso, unlike many anime I've seen, the ending is perfect and satisfying as well as being one of the few cases where I didn't think I could have done it better.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I truly enjoyed &quot;NHK&quot;, there's a possibility that it wouldn't appeal to all anime fans. It really is an adult story written for the 18+ crowd and there's likely to be little the younger anime fans will find to enjoy. It lacks action and despite it's simplicity, it's rather deep.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, &quot;NHK&quot; is up-and-down emotionally, with some very funny moments to moments that can really bring you down. The main character is a bit of a tragic figure and there's a good amount of dark humor.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this is one that no one will regret watching from start to finish. It's both refreshing and inspiring and is among the most heavily character-driven anime I've seen ((and I've seen a lot)).",

            "content": "Basic Analysis:\r\nNHK ni Youkoso! is about 22 year old college dropout Satou who has shut himself off from the world for 3 years. He is a hikikomori or N.E.E.T(Not in education, employment, or training). The anime basically shows how Satou deals with his hikikomori condition with the help of a mysterious girl named, Misaki. It explores themes of social isolation, human behavior and interaction. Even with the dark plot lines, the creators manage to make it funny with Satou's crazy imagination and Yamazaki's (Satou's neighbor) antics. \r\nA Closer Look:\r\nNHK ni Youkoso! doesn't have the best animation or the best soundtrack for that matter. Yet inmy eyes it is one of the best animes I've seen. Why? The characters are done superbly. Their actions, failures, and triumphs are realistically depicted. It may be because I identify with Satou a lot or it may be that I can relate to his view on the world around him. He believes that people are always looking down on him everywhere he goes. This is a often a fear of most people. For this reason, he shuts himself up in his apartment leaving only at night to buy groceries. However, there are many reasons people don't like this anime. First off, it CAN and WILL get frustrating to watch Satou deal with his hikikomori condition. If you are not patient, this anime is not for you. As I have said before, the animation isn't all that great either. But if you want an anime that focuses more on character development, you should give this anime a try. \\n\\n\r\nAn In-depth Analysis:\\n\r\nThe anime references themes of social withdrawal and reintegration. In Japan, the hikikomori condition is a very real problem. Human interaction is very difficult for these people due to fear of always being judged. Consumed by these fears, these people hide themselves in their homes to avoid embarrassment. Although these fears may seem nonsensical, it is simply human nature to judge and be judged. We all feel like we are being judged at some point. This feeling is exacerbated in hikikomoris. Although I would love to delve into the psychological aspects of the show, I want you to make your own conclusions. I feel like if you can relate to the characters, your enjoyment of the show will increase and you can appreciate the show for what it is, a commentary on social anxiety and human nature. \\n\\n\r\nCheers,\\n\r\nThe Critical Critic",

So far so often seen. \\n\r\nBut then there is Internet Porn and conspiracies, made up or not and the Japanese Broadcasting Company NHK and a lot of psychedelic encounters of talking imaginations.\\n\r\nBut all in such a delightful and subtile way told. \\n\\n\r\nNHK is so freaking great that I stoped at episode 23 because I didn't want it to be over. \\n\r\nI had to wait for a year and gather all my strength to finish this episode.\\n\\n\r\nNHK is not for everyone.\\n\r\nNHK is for you!

He decided to lock himself in his room for ever as a 'hikimori'.This anime explores the psychological effect on people who are rejected by society and gives the viewer a good outlook on life as a NEET. It is a heavy anime to watch, as Shato's insanity stops him from doing anything that willpotentially be good for him or help him. This anime will toy around with your feelings a lot about characters and scenarios, overall very well made and thought out. \\n\\n\r\nStory:  The story changes throughout the anime, it's mostly about people trying to help Shato become cured from his hikikomori state. Shato is very deep in hikikomori although he may not seem like it and this is very hard.   \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art for NHK is good, it displays what it needs to well and uses correct colours for the feeling that is being portrayed.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound is good, with all the evil laughing from his imaginations and the music fits into the environment. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Different feelings are experienced watching NHK about the characters, at times I hated some then I liked them again, then hated them again such as the main character Shato. They are all very deep characters with somewhat dark backgrounds who are mostly social rejects with problems in their lives and they are trying to get by, most of them shut themselves indoors for the majority of the time. Shato and Yamazaki are neighbours and they go through experiences together although at times they have their conflicts. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The enjoyment you get from watching this anime is not the usual 'haha' enjoyment you get it's that you see how people live with psycological issues and some of us can relate to them. I recommend you watch this in the shortest time you can, to get the maximum emotional outcome. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall a solid anime that was well thought out and executed. \\n",

            "content": "WELCOME TO THE NHK REVIEW:\r\nMINDSET:\r\nWait, GONZO is making an Anime not about horrible CGI and fan service?\r\nSYNOPSIS:\r\nNEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training) is a type of social outcast who always stays inside of the house, and as he/she refuses to leave to the outside world due to major psychological issues and is not in employment. Satou a 22 year-old man as our protagonist, is a NEET himself, thinks everything is a conspiracy and is truly their just to be manipulated by the \u201cNHK\u201d. As he is in desperation to find a cure of he's infection by getting out there for a job is fartoo frightening for him. Until he was commissioned for an option to take a project to stop himself from being in such a horrendous mess in he's life.\\n\\n\r\nREVIEW:\\n\r\nAnime that lean over the concept of NEETS, Hikikamori and the Otaku world tend to be far too light hearted for me to take them with actual seriousness, like how in Oreimo, Kouska being a hardcore Otaku is more of a character quirk and is more focused with her incest relationship of her brother, but even such concept is redeemed spoilt because Anime has to sugar coat the controversy having an inhumane moral saying, \u201cits OK to have sex with Your sister kids!\u201d or look at this poor Lolicon living as a NEET is a realistic example on how to live as a master detective!\\n\\n\r\nHowever; NHK steps up like a man, spits on its own hand and shakes the hands of the audience with legitamate respects regarding its unconventional themes and subject matter, while making rather dark jokes on its duration.\\n\\n\r\nThough mature, You can't help Yourself but to at least have a smirk on Your face on its dark comedic humour that it isn't too slap-stick as a your normal comedy, but has very fitting awkwardness to fit the hilarity of the situation, like how Kaoru an Otaku first meeting Satou saying on how much he loves dating sims and hentai games, and to be real  here, this is like the only Anime when there were times that made me legitimately laugh! What I love about the comedy is also how this exaggeration can also be interoperated in real life, which makes feel much more entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nCharacterisation blended with mature conceptualisation tend to feel contradictory with most shows airing, but its obvious that NHK does this very right since in some way, the characters relate themselves to real-life human situations, like an identity crisis, financial danger, society having more acceptance with Otaku culture etc. You get a really good grasp with there situation, and it all feels rather humanely realistic.\\n\\n\r\nEach character develops in some way shape or form, but what really sells this show is when it says it is psychological, it truly is psychological. You really do see the characters going through different kinds of despair, like being alone, hopelessness, without meaning, the show constantly gives You some very mature insight of what the characters are actually going through, unlike what most Anime these days either being made for escapism or failing to respect the audience.\\n\\n\r\nNHK has a very character driven narrative, it centres itself around it while making You laugh with dark tid bits of humour. I couldn't say that much of the story, except that the ending, wasn't as Amazing, but it did felt like a solid conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nGONZO is actually doing a one time only job when its not actually mixing action with bouncy jugs with horrible CGI, its nothing too special, and is only sufficient for its job. In fact, what I mostly loved of the Animation was the lack of CGI and big bouncy juggernauts to distract me in the first place. It has a nice, clean and very consistent budget, though character designs are a bit more unique than usual and only have 0 to 3 shades of colour, the animation is very sufficient, nothing note worthy, but its nice anyways.\\n\\n\r\nListening to the rather peaceful yet rather uniquely calm OST, I do feel as its more than efficient and relaxing to listen to than most OST I listen these days. It mixes a lot of instruments, like acoustic and electrical guitars, peaceful singing, sprinkled sound effects, drums, pianos etc. It feels different, but it really fits the mood quite perfectly for its deep sense of realism and dark under tones. Though the metal I don't really like. As for the OP, it gets You into the mood, but skip the ED since it does seem bizarre in my tongue, and it does have its fair share of more intense and sombre songs.\\n\\n\r\nLEGACY:\\n\r\nMost of the modern shows tend to be more relient on escapism and sugar coating such topics, and some create the illusion that its actually discussing these moralic issues in modern society, but its not even trying in reality, like Oreimo or Watamote etc. (I'm looking at You Hollow!) \\n\\n\r\nSuch Anime like this, come in every decade or two. (if not, ever) It steps out from the whole business side of things, and finally treats the audience like adults while it becomes one of the most cherished and most valued works of the Japanese Animated mediums of history. Will it still just a cherished by the fan base 8 decades later? YES. (and I also agree with the fan base)\\n\\n\r\nSCORES:\\n\r\n8/10 \u2013 It centers around such characters psychology in a very mature manner.\\n\r\n7.5/10 \u2013 For the story centering around such concepts that would not be taken seriously if it was made for the more main stream appeal.\\n\r\n6.5/10 \u2013 Sufficient Animation, yet a bit different. \\n\r\n6.5/10 \u2013 Nice OST, with a large range of emotion it covers.\\n\r\n8/10 \u2013 Because this Anime took me seriously, and took everyone seriously with respect! *Bows down GONZO*\\n\\n\r\nFINALE: 8.5/10!",

            "content": "Are many of us afraid to become a NEET or a hikikomori nowadays? You know, where you basically don\u2019t go to college or have a job, not contributing to society as most people calls it and instead you\u2019re living off your parents for money, becoming closed off to the world, anti-social to everyone you know (or at least that\u2019s what most people think of being anti-social, but mostly to the people you don\u2019t give a shit about) and basically you\u2019re referred to as a freak? Yeah, I\u2019m not going to sugarcoat this but this does exist in the world and it can discourage you atmost times during the time of your adult life. It can happen to anyone through anything.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTatsuhiro Satou, a 22 year old young man, is a NEET (Not in Employment, Education, or Training) and a hikikomori (meaning acute social withdrawal). He believes everything around him is a conspiracy, including the reason why many people, himself included, become hikikomori. Due to this, Satou (mostly influenced in his high school days by Hitomi Kashiwa, or as he calls her Senpai, yes, someone actually uses that word. Make all the \u201cI hope somebody-Senpai notices me\u201d jokes you want) creates a strange conspiracy theory which includes the Nihon Hikikomori Ky\u014dkai (NHK), a secret organization with the intention of producing a hikikomori filled world. Satou intends to break free from the NHK's clutches, but cannot, since he finds it too frightening to go outdoors by him; that is, until he meets Misaki Nakahara, who selects Satou for her \"project\" that she claims will cure him of his hikikomori ways and yet he wants to prove to her that he\u2019s not one by telling her he\u2019s a stay-at-home game designer working on his next project with the help of his irritable next-door neighbor Kaoru Yamazaki, who seems like a NEET but actually goes to a school and a bit more stable than Satou but still messed up in the head.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow, the premise of the series does seem a bit odd like why did somebody think of this in the first place, leading them to thinking that this would not work at all but in actuality, it fits perfectly fine as the series goes along with the tone of dark humor involving tropes and references of anime, online gaming, manga, and conspiracy theories among those. Somebody going outside of their world, feeling strange to surroundings that they are not familiar with and trying not to fail connecting or crossing in that world seems new to the world of anime since I\u2019m not sure if anyone uses that concept before, maybe in a few movies or TV series but not in an anime before.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, the show mainly has the focus on four main characters and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. Sato is an idiot, but I can\u2019t say he wasn\u2019t relatable or unlikable to anyone out there and not the stereotype of what most people think of NEETs. He may be a hikikomori but his problems are like what every day normal people goes through. It\u2019s another story with Yamazaki, I wanted to feel for this character but sometimes they are reasons why he should get his ass kicked and also close to the stereotype of the reason why geeks and nerds can\u2019t get laid\u2026\u2026that and that damn song he played at the beginning of the series got stuck in my head. I do like Misaki as a character since she does have good intentions on helping Satou with the counseling but it is obvious that she has a crush on him, I even spotted that from the beginning of the show. Hitomi may be a part of the past life of Satou but most of the time she\u2019s never relevant in the main plot except for a few episodes in the halfway mark. The dub voices of them by ADV Films were done well by Chris Patton, Luci Christian, Stephanie Wittels & Greg Ayres but I will say for Ayres if you can\u2019t tolerate his voice, then you will hate his character overall.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of the show is done by Gonzo. Okay, even though Gonzo is known for doing good animation in the earlier stages of an anime and then they\u2019ll fuck it up when they ran out of the animation budget but I don\u2019t hate Gonzo considering the past work I liked from them was Afro Samurai, Afro Samurai: Resurrection & Romeo X Juliet. What I said about Samurai 7 and their animation, the same can be said for this one but it felt like a better effort put into this since this falls under slice-of-life and they often get bigger budgets. The music is fairly okay with the main score sounds like something out of a Sundance Film Festival entry and the opening of the series is a standard light J-Pop sound but the ending music\u2026\u2026.oh, the ending music, I really love the ending song to this because it feels like one acid trip after another but unfortunately, that song only lasts for 12 episodes, the other song\u2026\u2026I won\u2019t speak of.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: Welcome to the N.H.K. is a daring series that doesn\u2019t bullshit on the details and it has all the elements of what you expect from an indie comedy-drama movie. I can see some people ranking this as high on their list but I\u2019ll say I consider this a must-see but not something you put in your hall of fame chest. The characters are relatable to an extent where it gets confusedly weird to get to, the animation is good at some times but can be bad and overall, while it can get depressing at some parts, it\u2019s still something that most anime (even non-anime fans that might get into anime) should check out.\\n",

SPOILERS**\r\nThis anime really confused me as to where it wanted to go, I thought it was gonna be a nice comedy/romance with the focus on someone that always stays at home for fears of the wider world. I was kinda right but this show goes so much deeper. \r\nIt starts of kind of lightheartedly then dips into the weirdness with those hentai games... but turns it all around with the climax towards the middle of the anime  with the suicide group, man thatwas a good episode, the way the show deals with people's emotions and  their decisions is extremely relatable for me personally. \\n\\n\r\nThe next half of the show was ok but the MC kinda got annoying in that he's really an idiot i liked that some of the characters kinda grew up though and the ending was quite good although I wanted more from it, i liked the Sato saved Misaki and that was her miracle just as she was Sato's miracle since the start of the show but even though the emotions flowed through that episode all they did was hug I wanted a move solid expression that they needed each other, I wanted the two to get together properly but they kinda ended it vaguely, I'll be honest i'm a fan of the happy ending even though i know this anime is quite harsh and realistic so I wanted Sato and Misaki to have a better ending not that the ending wasn't happy i wanted it to be/mean more.\\n\\n\r\nBasically this anime has good characters and some good deep themes that it uses well but i wasn't a fan of the weird hentai games or whatever it was and the characters actions were vague sometimes. The sound track for this show was good if only the ending was more fulfilling.\\n\r\n7.8/10",

            "content": "Characters - 9\r\nNHK's strongest element is in its characters. Each character has depth, suffering from severe issues that help push the idea that these are real people with real problems. One cannot help but immerse themselves in the world NHK establishes from connecting with its characters.\r\nStory - 7 *Vague scenarios/spoilers are discussed*\r\nNow, while the characters hold up throughout the show, the plot, however, does not, in a few ways. It's not that it's bad or mediocre, just lackluster in a few aspects. NHK is fairly slow out the gate. The comedy here isn't exactly my cup of tea, specifically the scenes with just Sato. I'venever been a fan of the use of caricatures and exaggerations for comedic effect  However, there are sprinkles of greatness throughout this part of the show, such as the introduction of Hitomi and the recollections of Sato's past. These scenes do a great job at selling the fact that Sato is a deteriorated, broken man with history. The scenes with Misaki are also very well done, as the ambiguity of who she exactly is and what her motives are, help to create a mysterious undertone that keeps you interested as the story progresses. I empathised with Sato the most here, as I too became suspicious of his surroundings and questioned the motives of those around him. \"Could this mystery girl be part of some conspiracy?\", I'd ask myself, despite thinking Hitomi and Sato are both loons for that exact questioning. So although as slow as the first quarter was, it did a great job at selling these characters, building a world, and ultimately establishing a foundation to build off of.\\n\\n\r\nThe second quarter is easily my favourite part of the show, and what I consider to be its peak. The moral conflicts and existential crises that arise are captivating, as these topics can hit close to home for many viewers transitioning into or who have transitioned into adulthood. The romance that begins to sprout between Misaki and Sato is also wonderfully done, as it is truly sweet and heartfelt. The show's more serious subject matter is also introduced here, concerning anxiety and suicide. The atmosphere transitions slowly and surely into a darker, and morbid one. The subject matter is handled very well, and the pacing seemless.\\n\\n\r\nThe third quarter is where things begin to fall apart. Miscommunication is prevalent here, which goes on to greatly effect my experience of rest of the show. The tone shifts constantly between comedic and brooding abruptly, to the point where I was confused on how I was supposed to interpret many of the scenes. For example, a character will be crying, this being obviously sad and heartfelt, and then suddenly a comedic exaggeration or snarky comment comes out of nowhere and shifts the tone to a comedic one. I then naturally interpret the character crying as comedic, as if they are supposed to be seen as being hilariously melodramatic (Considering the context being misread by the character in-question), even though it's clearly not supposed to be after they collapse to their knees. Another example would be character A says something unintentionally hurtful to character B. Character B's reaction is exaggerated and played up. It is comedic. Skip to the next episode and character B is threatening a helpless, traumatised character A, supposedly for what they had said previously. This is a confusing scene considering character B's reaction from the previous episode does not match up with character B's actions in the current episode. It feels as though their actions are completely out of left field, rather than having been built up from a foundation. These serious, heavy issues are suddenly dropped at the end of the episode and do not resurface until the final quarter. The serious and rather unnerving implications stuck with me for the remainder of the show, picking at me with every new episode, with absolutely no acknowledgement whatsoever. The show shifts from melodrama to comedic filler very quickly, resulting in an unsatisfying conclusion to the arc. Several characters disappear and become far less prevalent here as well. Misaki, surprisingly, has far less screen time and development, focusing more on Sato's shenannigans. \\n\\n\r\nThe final quarter does somewhat make up for the lackluster third quarter, delving deeper into the mental states of the characters. The remaining episodes do a good job at focusing on Misaki and Sato's relationship, what I considered the show's greatest aspect. \\n\\n\r\nConcerning the ending, I enjoyed it. It was very touching and sweet. As much as I would have wanted more (if you know what I mean) it still did a solid job at closing out the show in a satisfying way. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 9\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is brilliant. The mix of rock, acoustic, and piano does wonders for establishing appropriate atmospheres. I, personally, would have preferred female vocals for the more melancholic songs, but they were still fantastic. The voicework is also superb. The voice cast; Greg Ayres, Chris Patton, Stephanie Wittels, and Luci Christian, did an absolutely phenomenal job portraying their characters. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\\n\r\nNHK has an interesting artstyle, but the art itself didn't impress me. Surprisingly enough, the most jarring moments come from when the animation quality suddenly spikes during emotional scenes, treading on the Uncanny Valley, as I was not accustomed to that amount of detail on the characters' faces. Occasionally though, the art can be beautiful. Scenes with Misaki and Sato conversing in the park are well done, and have a wonderful colour palette of blue and black that, when juxtaposed with the bright characters, cause the characters to pop. The final few episodes are also very well done.",

            "content": "\"There are conspiracies in this world. But 99% of all so-called conspiracies are simply imagination. So, 1% is the truth? \"\r\nWelcome to NHK is anime all about Mr. Satou Tatsuhiro, a 22 year old college dropout living his hikkimori life style. A Hikkimori is a person who hates or afraid of society; people who refuse to leave their house and, thus, isolate themselves from society in their homes. This anime tackles that since the author who made the story is a hikkimori himself while he wrote this, that's what he claim that is and is unknown if he still is till now.\r\nThis anime havestory arcs that compose of sensitive subjects like the life of an otaku, making dreams happen, depression, scams and suicide. These subjects were handled as realistic as can happen in real life. The good thing is it was handled in a very lighthearted way with each arc. All of this involves Satou that you would think his character is developing for the better, right? Not really.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the beginning you will describe Satou as a very pathetic man. He will easily be influence from those of whom or what is around him and affect his actions. But without those influence either good or bad well, he will not do anything like a mannequin waiting for someone to look at him.  As the show goes on I really can't say for certain that something change or any improvement for his character, same goes for the supporting characters. In short, character development in this anime is vague.\\n\\n\r\nThe driving force that kept things interesting is the mysterious girl who wants to help the main character out of his hikkimori life. You can say her methods are quite silly but kept the main character attach to her. Not because of her methods, but because he wants to figure out why she's helping a bum like him. This led this two in an unusual romantic development with both not even knowing. It was cute.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in this anime is slightly above average and inconsistent. It was standard for a mid 2000's anime but you will notice some animation style changes in some scenes. Our description may be different but I find it inappropriate to change the animation styles in random moments. I assume it\u2019s due to budget or they want to emphasize that certain moment. The result, I was not impressed. The music is also slightly average because the only memorable soundtrack for me is when the harmonica is playing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Welcome to NHK is the best hikkimori themed anime you can find. It shows the struggles, the mindset and psychological aspects of being a hikkimori. This show will give its viewers life lessons like moving forward in life is important, depression is a serious matter, and being a hikkimori sucks.  \\n\\n\r\nBut that doesn't mean I wouldn't overlook the flaws as it stands out throughout my experience watching it. As much as I like the story as I want to give this anime a high score in its story alone, but other elements like the animation, music and overall enjoyment prevents it\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm gonna tell you right off the bat that I firmly believe that Welcome to the NHK is one of the greatest anime ever created and I'd you have not seen it you owe it to yourself to watch this series. Seriously. It is has one of the best stories in anime that uses some really really deep themes such as suicide and anxiety, and has enough comedy to keep you laughing from start to finish. And I know that the majority of people who watch it will relate to it in some way or another. You will not find an anime more REAL thanthis one. Ladies and  Gentleman, Welcome to the NHK. (See what I did there ;)\\n\\n\r\n[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS] (just watch it, trust me.)\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 10/10\\n\r\nThe story follows Satou Tatsuhiro, a HIKIKOMORI. Which is a person who is an introvert who shuts themselves off from the rest of society. Satou is convinced that a there is a conspiracy out to get him made by the NHK (Nihon Hikikomori Kyoukai) which was started by his only friend in high school, his senpai Hitomi. Satou was in college for a short time until he had a breakdown and ran all the way back to his apartment. He has since stayed in his apartment never leaving for 4 years. Then one day, a girl named Misaki shows up stating that she wants to \"help him.\" The thing I love most about this anime is that it's just so REAL. There are actual people like this in the world who struggle with anxiety and can't socialize with people. The themes this show uses get very dark and depressing ranging from suicide to extreme anxiety and panic attacks. It is absolutely flawlessly executed. Near the end I couldn't get a lump out of my throat with the amount of depressing scenes. This is the REALEST anime I've ever seen. And the final 3 episodes of this series are just impossible to stop watching. They are so enthralling and thrilling that I dare you to try and break immersion near the end. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 9/10\\n\r\nThere is not one forgettable character in this series. I'll talk about three characters starting with our protagonist. I consider Satou Tatsuhiro one of the most well written and most relatable characters in anime. EVERY anime fan has a part of Satou inside of them. When your just in that mood of never wanting to see anyone and just stay inside all day.  Seriously, Satou is living the life. Wouldn't you love to never have to work and get money from your parents and just watch anime all day? Or basically just be a NEET? Yeah. He goes through some of the best character development I've ever seen. He starts off as an innocent Hikikomori, and with slight help from Misaki, turns into a somewhat normal human being. (I'm being generous) he goes through very dark and depressing times where he contemplates suicide on multiple occasions. However, he goes through enough comedic moments that really come refreshing and make it easier to get through the depressing moments of the show. \\n\r\nNext character is Yamazaki. The token Otaku of the anime who ends up being Satou's best friend and probably the most important person in Satou's life. He is the only person that Satou can really talk to and open up to. And he is the comic relief character of the series. And with his synonymous line \"Hentai Games\" he is an avid pervert and gets Satou to make a \"Gal-Game\" with him. \\n\r\nFINALLY we have probably the most interesting character in the series, Misaki. She shows up one day at Satou's door and says she wants to help him with his problem and Satou wants no part of it. [SPOILERS] The 180 her character goes through came out of nowhere and started the thrilling conclusion to this series. The REAL REASON she wanted to help Satou was because she had a terrible childhood where she was led to believe that she was a worthless human being and she wanted to try and find someone that had an even worse life than her so she could feel better about herself. \\n\r\nAll of these characters I will never forget. \\n\\n\r\nART: 6/10\\n\r\nGonzo is known to be a hit or miss studio. This is one of their misses. It doesn't look that bad but compared to the other things coming out at the same time as this, it doesn't look good. There is literally an episode where there are no key frames at all. However, I definitely feel this is one of those shows where the story overpowers the poor animation. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9/10\\n\r\nNHK has a great opening, which you get to hear throughout all 24 episodes. The series uses a lot of insert songs which perfectly fit the show. Especially one song titled \"Hitori Bocchi\" which translates to \"Loneliness\" which is a very fitting title.\\n\r\nThe dub has Chris Patton as Satou (which is reason enough to watch it) and he does a great job as always. And Greg Ayres is just Greg Ayres as usual with Yamazaki. Everyone did a pretty good job. (I can't speak on behalf of the Japanese VAs but I'm assuming they're good.)\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 7/10\\n\r\nOVERALL: 10/10\\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\\n\r\nWelcome to the NHK is one of the best anime I've ever seen. It really hit me hard with its themes and will probably hit you hard too. I consider it a must watch for every anime fan out there. I'll say it again that I feel it is one of the REALEST anime in existence. Everyone can relate to it somehow. And if not, just stay fire the hilarious comedy and plot twists. The anime has many messages in it for the viewers none bigger than two: No matter how bad your life is, never consider suicide. Because your not only hurting yourself, but your hurting the ones who care about you most. And the other message is loneliness can really take its toll on someone. Without human interaction you'll always be lonely and longing for some friendship. I don't give out a 10 overall rating often, so that should be enough to tell you that Welcome to the NHK is DEFINITELY worth the watch. \\n\r\nGO WATCH IT NOW. \\n\\n\r\nPOSITIVES:\\n\r\n-Well executed and relatable story\\n\r\n-Unforgettable characters\\n\r\n-Great soundtrack\\n\r\n-Really dark and true themes\\n\r\n-Hilarious\\n\\n\r\nNEGATIVES:\\n\r\n-Sub-par animation from Gonzo\\n\r\n-Not every episode will have you on the edge of your seat\\n\r\n-Open ended ending\\n\\n\r\nThank you and congratulations for reading this lengthy review. Do yourself a favor and go watch Welcome to the NHK.",

            "content": "Anime Review No.11\r\nWelcome to the NHK! A show that from the title itself welcoming you to a world so bizarre it\u2019s beyond your imagination  but actually that is not the case here in this anime. The anime is neither fantasy nor supernatural and it\u2019s not even close to becoming sci fi but it is just your normal life setting about a guy being a \u201chikikomori\u201d or \u201cNEET\u201d shut in he\u2019s own apartment and not doing anything that particularly different nor even awesome cool stuff like other anime \u201cNEET\u201d portrays . So why does the anime stand out for being a rare uniquely made bizarreshow that achieve the masses appreciation if it is not something extraordinary? NHK got its fame simply because it has rich content\u2019s and amazing presentation  in good storytelling without going over the top by adding irrelevant stuff and not having it\u2019s events drifting away to the main goal of the plot. NHK formula is something you won\u2019t see in any other typical anime that focus the story on \u201cHikikomoris\u201d which is in my experience always tells lies about them being cool and awesome. NHK don\u2019t tell lies about \u201cHikikomoris\u201d and it will explain it in the most mature way and entertaining way it can to make your eyes not wavering. Welcome to the NHK is an anime that everybody should watch and it\u2019s recommended to both anime fans and non anime fans alike. One of the best eye openers and mind revealing truths that most anime won\u2019t even show and that\u2019s why NHK is bizarre to a sense it\u2019s contradicting and bashing the industry of this year 2015 target audience where Japan is experiencing a huge population of NEET\u2019s and Hikikomoris. \\n\\n\r\nI wish this short review can help you guys to have motivation to try the show. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy Review about the anime above is the Summarize and \u201cSpoiler Free\u201d Version. If you want to read my entire overview about NHK which have unavoidable spoilers in reviewing each element keep on scrolling and keep on reading. I wish my entire overview can help you guys appreciate the anime more.\\n\\n\r\nPlot (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nNHK plot is not for people who always like and look positive outlook in life for the reason from the beginning of the episode the story started to a very gloomy and depressing atmosphere which most people will drop it for being so negative and will question is this anime really a comedy? If you are waiting for the anime to give comedy I suggest you guys to be patient and you won\u2019t be seeing the light humor yet for the psychological part of the series is introducing what is NHK atmosphere and plot is all about. What I like about this anime is that it is \u201cDark\u201d and it\u2019s Dark for it\u2019s really straight forward about delivering it\u2019s message about real life in a mature and a psychological way. Everything the plot present makes senses and nothing is force to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes the script writing of the series genius is that psychological and comedy blends in the series. Mostly when comedy is mix with the psychological part and what negatively happens is that the event won\u2019t be taken seriously and psychological anime need to be taken seriously but NHK didn\u2019t have that kind of problem the because of the script handled correctly. The drama and comedy also blends well for psychological part making the drama more realistic and at the same time not dull for the comedy is pulling some kind magic in entertaining the viewers. In lay man\u2019s terms the atmosphere of the series is dark but at the same time emotionally realistic and at the same time you think the situation is kind of funny for if you are seeing yourself in that kind of situation is just plain humorous. Using this great formula we get \u201cNHK\u201d as great form of intellectual entertainment. An anime that don\u2019t make you over think much and just enjoy the ride of the show. The romance part of the series takes the conclusion to be rewarding. The romance part of the series have a reasonable spacing in the development for as the relationship of the 2 main characters further improve romance blooms in the corner which is acceptable. Love takes time to develop and you can\u2019t force it in a short amount of time. The 2 characters have lot of time to think over about their true feelings for a realistic romance to be establish and that\u2019s the anime have the most decent romance as a conclusion. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters is the most crucial part what make\u2019s \u201cNHK\u201d stand out. I didn\u2019t mention \u201cHikikomori\u2019s\u201d are not smart. I admit \u201cHikikomoris\u201d are just introverts that are well productive being alone than with other and the \u201cN.E.E.T\u2019s\u201d admit themselves they know want the situation they are going through as the show portrays and this people just need a little helping hand to cure them in this psychological disorder and \u201cspoiler\u201d  yes the show give positive solution on how they can be cured and also give the hint\u2019s how being a Hikikomori begins and I won\u2019t expand that topic to prevent further \u201cspoilers\u201d. The characters are likeable given a small cast they all have different personalities and behavior the work well with the plot and the environment which make it enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nI will give a short summary why I liked this characters and \u201cyeah this another spoiler alert\u201d but I won\u2019t mention their development because it will totally spoil the show. \\n\\n\r\nSatou- His the main protagonist of the show and the top notch \u201cworthless and a failure as human being\u201d and I am not making this up the show and the cast said so. He\u2019s the most relatable characters of the series because of his action and way of thinking. Want to know more? Watch the show!\\n\\n\r\nSenpai- She have a name but I will call her that cause I hear senpai more often than her name. I may say the least liked character but yeah she is one of those serious type but I like it. She add appeal to the show and also an influence to the Satou\\n\\n\r\nMisaki- The girl I thought to be 1 dimensional girl but I was wrong. Once you see her character development you will know what I am talking about.\\n\\n\r\nYamazaki- I rate as the best otaku of all anime I have watched in years his character is further likeable as character development took place.\\n\\n\r\nOthers- Find out but I will tell they are all good people not plot irrelevant but they are the reason why the plot is so fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAll in All the characters in NHK are one of the hardest thing other anime can\u2019t easily imitate cause the characters in the not 1 dimensional card boards but complex people with different behavior as the time and events demands it. This is why NHK is very good anime. It\u2019s character wise.\\n\r\n(Art & Music) 9 for Art & 10 for Music\\n\\n\r\nArt part:\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s your  typical gonzo animation but why did I give score of 9 is because the anime under budget but it didn\u2019t affect the anime production but instead it use it as advantage to make the show more realistic setting in psychological atmosphere. The exaggeration is made from the illusion of the characters not their real life movement which make the art smart and not dull stupid. The plot help the art to become pretty color even though in reality it\u2019s not as colorful as other anime using flashing effects and over the top CGI to make the atmosphere colorful. NHK become colorful not by art style but it\u2019s the plot that influence the viewers to appreciate the art and that\u2019s a great factor what I like NHK. NHK is so memorable that when you see other anime with similar art you always remember NHK. \\n\\n\r\nMusic Part:\\n\r\nI am not going to introduce the title of the music but this I will tell you the music have to sides that blends well in the themes of the show. The opening is just 1 song played in the duration of all 24 episodes which is nice and light hearted and then we get the ending with dark meaning that I really like because it delivers a negative message about human psychological mind yeah \u201ckidult\u201d a very strong word for the \u201cHikikomoris\u201d. The 2nd ending I won\u2019t name is a nice ending and it marks the story progression going to the light side. I see the ending a good song to hear from time to time. Background music is truly a master piece. Background music of NHK is a mood swinger but that mood is not emotionally dramatic but rather natural and smoothing no need to feel crying but instead be light hearted and cheer up! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)! \\n\\n\r\nI feel rewarded after finishing this series. I am contended with the ending of the anime but because the concept was so full of great ideas I might pursue reading the light novel and manga. NHK is good anime given a good amount of time to enjoy the series this anime is great time spender. A really entertaining show believes me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe anime deserve the master piece level because it got its identity for being \u201cNHK\u201d.  I am sure at the time I made this review I have no known anime that can become very close to NHK. I did have one series but it\u2019s not close enough to the hikikomori concept. I highly recommend this show to everybody who is interested to know the negative facts and information about \u201cN.E.E.T\u2019s\u201d. This show is good for It didn\u2019t tell lies but true psychological facts as a backbone support. What are you waiting for watch NHK if you have the time to try and if you are done NHK! is not bad for rewatch and I also recommend the manga and light novel if you want more.  \\n\\n\r\nShort Facts about the 2 different mediums:\\n\\n\r\nLight Novel- It\u2019s much darker so I recommend watch the anime first before the novel but the light novel provide more details.\\n\\n\r\nManga- You can try this first after watching the anime or after you finish the novel cause the manga give the more expanded details about the conclusion of the show and \u201cspoiler\u201d the manga\u2019s ending is different same with the  Novel.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review is helpful to guys :)\\n",

If I had to describe it in more than three words though, I\u2019d best start a bit more eloquently.\r\nWelcome to the NHK is easily one of the best series I\u2019ve seen, for many reasons. As couldn\u2019t necessarily be gleaned from the title (Unless you agree with Sato that the NHK stands for the Nihon Hikikomori Kyoukai), the main character is a hikikomori and NEET (Not currently in Employment, Education,or Training).\\n\\n\r\nHe wastes away his days sleeping for upwards of 16 hours and lamenting his current lifestyle, living off his parents\u2019 goodwill and convenience store-grade instant ramen. Sato is a frightful, lonely, hateful person who wants nothing more than to disappear off the face of the earth and end his self imposed torment.\\n\\n\r\nThe beauty of NHK is its delicate balance of such serious subject matter with comedy in a way that only accentuates the hell that Sato lives through, and leaves one chuckling nervously rather than laughing uproariously at his misadventures on the path to readjustment. It\u2019s a superb comedy, but the grim premise pervades every bit of the show, limiting the laughs somewhat.\\n\\n\\n\r\nWith the help of a girl of mysterious motivations who solicits pamphlets at his door one day and offers to free him of his hikikomori shackles through nightly lessons of seemingly little consequence, Sato begins to break out of his shell, learning to love himself and others again, while dealing with society in all its intricacies.\\n\\n\r\nAlong the way to reintegration with society, Sato is joined and tormented by old friends and classmates: A manic depressive paranoiac who influenced him in major ways in high school and continues to, a hotheaded otaku with a passion for all things ecchi who always plays the theme to his favorite mahou shoujo series repeatedly in the beginning, and his old class president turned salesman whose reason for meeting him might be more than meets the eye.\\n\\n\r\nEach of the characters play a pivotal role in his story, and the dialogue between them feels as genuine as can be, while letting their unhealthy personalities and mindsets shine. The entirety of the series is a very uncomfortable, yet somehow pleasant experience as a result.\\n\\n\r\nWhen not focusing on the drama and dysfunction of the characters\u2019 lives, NHK is very scathing in its focus on otaku culture. From figurine shopping to eroge to online games, several things are poked fun of, in ways that left me better informed at the end. However, the drama is the main focus, and in many instances easily outdo many other series in the drama department that I\u2019ve seen (I\u2019d rate this a million times better than Clannad).\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is also worth noting. From the spirited performances by the seiyuu to the irritatingly catchy Pururin theme, it never ceases to be entertaining. \\n\r\nHowever, the animation and artwork are, at best, decent. They get the job done, and nothing else. And really, nothing else needs to be done.\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap things up, Welcome to the NHK is a series as thought provoking as it is mindless entertainment, as good as it is bad... while it isn't perfect, it's pretty close in my eyes.",

            "content": "Welcome to the NHK is an anime series made by Studio Gonzo, and is based off the novel and manga of the same name. I am unfamiliar with those versions, but have heard the anime was great. I am glad that I watched the whole series on Funimation's website, for I enjoyed it very much.\r\nStory:\r\nThe show is about a 22-year old named Satou. He is a hikikomori, or shut-in, living in a tiny apartment in Tokyo. He has no job, and has frequent delusions of an organization called the NHK trying to mess with him. The whole series is about him coping with his socialanxiety, as well as his interactions with the people close to him. The show is a comedy at times, but a drama at other times. When the show's funny, it's very funny, and when it's serious, you will be gripped. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of the artwork is variable. At times, the animation is pretty good, particularly in Satou's daydream sequences. At other times, (especially in the beginning of episode 19) it's amateurish. It's not one of the better looking anime series I've seen, but it's good enough for a tv series. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe background music is pretty good. It always fits the scene that's playing very well. Also, the opening song is really great. I have no complaints about the music.\\n\\n\r\nI only saw the English dub, but it too was satisfactory. Curiously enough, it was done by ADV, and I don't normally like their dubs. This, however, was actually well done. The only problem is some of the voice actors mispronounce the Japanese terminology, but it's not that big of a deal, since you should know what they're referring to. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization:\\n\\n\r\nSatou is a neurotic individual with a lot of problems, yet is still a likable and believable protagonist. The other characters, particularly Satou's neighbor Yamazaki, are memorable in their own right. Everyone undergoes significant growth throughout the series, and by the end, you'll feel genuinely attached to them. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nThe more humorous episodes contain some of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in Japanese animation. The more serious episodes contain moments that are both soul-crushing and uplifting. There's not a single episode that may me think, \"Wow! That episode really sucked!\" The ending was well done, too. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nWelcome to the NHK is a dark examination of the hikikomori phenomenon. It's more realistic than your typical anime series. That said, it's very well put together, and warrants at least one viewing. You can watch the entire series on Funimation.com, provided you don't mind watching it in English. Either way, watch it if you can. Come for the humor, stay for the pathos. 9/10",

            "content": "I had a few expectations before watching Welcome to the N.H.K. One being that I was looking for an anime a lot like Watamote. The second one, I wanted to find another character with quite a few similarities with Tomoko. The main character from Watamote.\r\nStory 9/10: Its safe to say that this anime can be hilarious and painful. And with those two, you get a great entertaining show. It takes us into the world of a shut-in NEET, better known as a hikikomori. I like to call this, what life is really like in some situations. Whilst watching the anime, through out I had countlessthoughts on the whole \"wage-slave/corporate-slave\" type of thing, which are the types that really fit into this anime since they're mentioned a few times. It's just a matter of finding them which isn't too hard. Following the life of our hikikomori college drop out, Sato, can really show us great details on what being a NEET really is. The word you'll find most in this one is \"conspiracy\", \"everything is just a conspiracy\".\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: The art for me at first, was a little bit of a let down. I didn't find it all that appealing but then it blended in nicely. Very pencil like drawings which create the wacky-est faces, I loved it in end. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: Had a nice opening which there's actually two of, just slightly different instrument wise. The first ending was catchy and the background music fitted in well with the situations that were happening. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: Ah yes, some outstanding characters in this one. The characters were the most enjoyable part of the anime for me.\\n\r\nStarting off with the main character Tatsuhiro Sato, he is the hikikomori of the show. Being a twenty two year old college dropout, afraid of society, he doesn't have much going for him. The struggles are almost endless but always keep you watching. Sometimes he has the mental breakdowns facing reality over and over, knowing how bad his condition is. the isolation he's in can be pretty painful to watch, however there's the few scenes in which he talks like he's proud of how long he's been hikikomori. Which is almost four years. In this culture, he found it difficult at times to get by which is when the painful moments start to kick in and take action. I made sure to prepare myself for these types of scenes which involve mental type of conditions that are quite fierce. \\n\\n\r\nThe next main character we have is Nakahara Misaki. Sweet girl at the start of the story, mysterious and decided to help Sato out of his hikikomori lifestyle. This was for both their benefit, for her \"big project\" and to help Sato lead a normal life. Once again, whilst watching this I couldn't help of think of the \"normal life\" being nothing more than a \"corporate slave\". Her character development went a little down hill, though not in a completely bad way, things just got a lot more dramatic as her worries and troubles build up. She especially admired her relationship with Sato which may have triggered off the dramatic events to come for her. Sweet girl non the less. \\n\\n\r\nI'll go with one last character for this series, this review won't need more than three. Anyway, next there's the \"otaku-next-door\" Yamazaki Kaoru. Yes, he lived next door from Sato. He would usually be playing some kind of anime music all day, which annoyed Sato like hell. They happen to become friends threw this, and that's where their relationship took off. Yamazaki spent most of his time trying to motivate Sato, which was a serious pain in the ass for him. They're both working on a project, and in order to keep it going, he needs to keep Sato involved. Even though Yamazaki did most of the work. He had a nice character development, showing his struggles which are mostly the same as any other male otakus out there. Such as trying to get a girlfriend and what not rather than settling for a body pillow. I actually liked how Yamazaki showed his love for \"gal games\", anime characters and buying anime merch. It all fits in perfectly with his character. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10: Well, to sum everything up. This was a very enjoyable anime, especially if you can relate to either of the characters. There isn't a lot of characters in this show which makes is tons better. Each character has their own problems and some ways to over come them, we get to see each of their stories and get an idea on what the \"real world\" is like. I think the shortest way to sum this anime up is that its about a shut-in and quite a lot of people around him want to help with his condition. Sometimes they do and sometimes they don't. It always left me with the question, \"Wouldn't it be good to be hikikomori, having a nice carefree life with no responsibilities\". Well, that's something you find out watching this anime.",

            "content": "The reason why I believe Welcome to the NHK is strong and particularly rare anime is because of its ability to convey a theme and message effectively without being overtly condescending nor pretentious.\r\n    The core theme of NHK focuses on major insecurities that eventually plague their individual lifestyles and often times those of others. In order to tackle this theme more effectively, Satou is made a hikkimori in more of a general sense. There are a lot of shut-in types that pervade society, but Satou represents one in the more general sense in that his behavior revolves around a very basicbut potent fear of people. This becomes an interesting dynamic since NHK, like many other drama shows, is highly character driven. It allows Satou to be like an entry barrier or an overall source that exemplifies the different types of insecurities that pop up during the show, and along the way, he often reflects those flaws on the surface of his own persona as well. Satou\u2019s malleable characteristics make him a flexible and effective character to envision the general idea of mental insecurities.\\n\\n\r\n    To illustrate further, Satou comes across a variety of different characters that all in some way have had a hazy relationship with him in the past. Yamazaki is one of the first characters the viewer meets along Satou\u2019s journey. He is arguably the least flawed out of all the characters in the entire show as his motivation is primarily driven by the rejection of his ultimate fate, that of being a farmer. It\u2019s interesting because Yamazaki\u2019s main introduction comes in the form of being an insufferable nuisance of Satou\u2019s hikkimori life, which at first frames him as a being as selfish as Satou. However, he is, at heart, probably the most honest character among the cast of misfits Satou meets. The purity of Yamazaki\u2019s intentions directly juxtaposes with Satou\u2019s who partners up with Yamazaki only on the pretense of deceiving Misaki and as a result is a great character at highlighting Satou\u2019s personality. Out of all the issues that Satou encounters, Yamazaki\u2019s is probably the most general and thus the most likely relatable. He still goes to school, but still experiences rejection in the form of his passion and his love and is often alienated because of his interests. None of these are conditions but rather simple insecurities that plague many others, even though he initially seems like an extreme. Many people may not resonate with Yamazaki since ultimately he gives up his dream of being a game creator to accept his inevitable fate of being a farmer, but in my opinion, it\u2019s a fine resolution of the insecurity Yamazaki represents, denial and fear. The message of Yamazaki\u2019s dilemma isn\u2019t that people should give up on their dreams, it\u2019s moreso that if those dreams don\u2019t come true, it\u2019s still possible to find happiness and peace in a path that you once vehemently rejected.\\n\\n\r\n    Hitomi\u2019s arc is possibly the most poignant. To Satou, she is the one that introduced to him the concept of conspiracy theories, so it becomes easy to see how their distrust in others naturally formed. Individually, she suffers a more general desire to be wanted, but it comes in the form of an extreme. Suicide rates are high particularly in Japan, and the idea of an offline meeting where likeminded individuals who all want to commit suicide for one reason or another is very uncomfortable, but believable. Once again, the interesting dymanic here is that Satou doesn\u2019t initially want to commit suicide, but the more he realizes how pathetic he is as a human being, he inches closer and closer to the edge. Even when he attempts suicide, he still fears death, and Satou\u2019s inability to control his decisions comes forward in an emotional ultimatum (https://youtu.be/HMCJVvYj00Y?t=516).\\n\\n\r\n    Megumi and her brother are the last pair that Satou and Misaki come across. They\u2019re perhaps the most interesting, particularly because Satou and Megumi\u2019s brother share many parallels, and ergo, so do Misaki and Megumi herself. Formerly a figure of respect, she eventually devolves down to a pyramid scheme, and many of her relationships with others are based on the concept of deception and manipulation. It\u2019s perhaps less of an insecurity and more of a desperation to do anything at whatever mean\u2019s necessary in order to accomplish her goals, even though at the same time she is well-aware that she too is being tricked. Like always, Satou also initially entertains the idea of participating in the pyramid business for personal gain. Megumin\u2019s brother represents the final stage of Satou\u2019s potential hikkimori state as a foreshadow of how degenerate Satou\u2019s life can become. When he eventually works at the ramen shop, it also hints at further foreshadowing in Satou\u2019s character.\\n\\n\r\n    What\u2019s interesting about all these problems is how they were approached and how they were resolved. Satou never actually helped any of these people solve their issues. In fact, sometimes he even wanted help himself. In reality, Satou was often the one absorbing the experiences within him, and many of the problems actually solved themselves often through self-realization, and it\u2019s only after all of these experiences does Satou finally escape from his hikkimori lifestyle. Additionally, it becomes steadily obvious that Misaki, who was initially framed as the voice of reason in Satou\u2019s life, is just as flawed as every other character that Satou sees reform along the way. Ironically, she too is the last one in the show to be \u201creformed\u201d (\u201creformed\u201d obviously being a contentious word to use in this context, but I\u2019ll get to it later).\\n\\n\r\n    Of course, the primary idea of NHK is the fact that, well, the NHK is the one that\u2019s secretly creating all these problems for Satou, and it\u2019s exemplified in its own way as the story progresses. Different appliances and furniture start talking as if it was Satou\u2019s own conscience, and many times during the show he uses it as his guiding voice. Ultimately however, much of the time it\u2019s more or less a projection of what Satou wants to hear versus what he thinks he should to do. The \u201cAlone in the Universe\u201d scene (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DRLiLCDsB0) in my opinion I think captures this fairly well as he devolves into delusions of grandeur only to be met with the silence of reality. As a small tangent, NHK has a wonderful scene in the last episode that parallels the \u201cAlone in the Universe\u201d clip (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EETYBwHpTuM). Satou contemplates his life against his hallucinations, admitting the harsh reality than building a false persona. His hallucinations come in the form of those he met along his away instead of incarnations of household appliances, and the scene is done in absolute silence instead of playing the classic \u201cWelcome to Loneliness\u201d track. The clip ends with a haunting \u201cYou guys\u2026 Who are you?\u201d, where Satou for the first time questions the voices that seek to control him, although ironically those voices finally come from his friends and not dubious appliances.\\n\\n\r\n    Neither Satou or Misaki are truly reformed by the end of the show, but in my opinion, this is alright. To reiterate, none of the actual problems in NHK were solved via divine intervention or some other means of a forced hand; they were all resolutions that ultimately came about on their own terms and with the ones they share a visceral connection to. The show ends on the note of how it started, but instead of Misaki helping Satou vaguely through dubious intentions, it\u2019s a mutual relationship that\u2019s developed on the basis of trust. Symbolically, it\u2019s represented by his perceived destruction of the NHK conspiracy which he does by attempting to commit suicide. It\u2019s a bit of an overdramatic moment, but it does represent a moment of conviction, referencing his previous suicide attempt, but also one where he sacrifices his life to save another in an ultimate attempt of selflessness. The destruction of said NHK projections indirectly frees Satou from his belief that the NHK is ruining his life, finally allowing him to take the next step forward. Perhaps it isn\u2019t the resolution everyone was hoping for, but it does end on a high note on the promise of development based on the indications that were scattered across the show and in the show\u2019s climax.\\n\\n\r\nIt's tough to admit whether or not you enjoyed a show if it isn't very consistent. A show that starts off phenomenally can end terribly if it forgets itself during the process. On the other hand, a show that struggles to find its footing only to reach it at the end asks the question if the initial episodes were even worth it. The ability to remain true to itself from start to finish is a core factor of what turns an average show into something special, as it's the format that truly takes advantage of what it means to be a story that's more than just the sum of its parts. \"Welcome to the NHK\" is an excellent example of this idea in motion, and it has done so in such an effective way that it has allowed this piece of work to be remembered and regarded as one of the strongest shows that the 2000's wave of anime has ever seen.",

Also I'm spoiling a whole lot in this, so consider yourself warned. Anyway this paper will rather provide thinkpieces for people that already know the show quite well, inviting them to go deeper. You can now swallow you xanax pill and get started.\r\nNHK ni Yousoko introduces itself with a premise that may make one wonder about where it's gonna go fromthere: Satou has been a \u201chikikomori\u201d for three years now \u2013 meaning he does not get out of his flat except when there's a vital need to get groceries, is afraid by the simple thought of having to have contact with anyone and feels contrived by the social pressure the japanese society puts on his shoulder. If anything this show leaves us expecting something dark, murky and desperate. And we all know these japanese guys like a good ol' I-feel-like-killing-myself-after-watching-that show from time to time. In fact the anime is willingly sleazy at times, often pessimistic and even sometimes abject. But it's not that simple though: NHK ni Yousoko is also full of humor. It doesn't forget that even at the lowest times (mainly at the lowest times) there's always the need, the vital necessity to find something to laugh at. To rebound, to retaliate at the face of misery, to avoid offering yourself as tribute in the hands of anguish and void. To stay alive. And let's give it away: the greatest strenght of the serie is probably to manage these comical spins to extract itself from darkness to continue its deepening of its social and personal themes and elaborate its purpose without giving up to cheap and uncalled murkiness for the sole purpose of giving away human misery as a show for a blood-thirsted audience.\\n\\n\r\n_________________\\n\\n\r\n1st wandering - Show me you buddies and I'll tell you who you are\\n\\n\r\nThe big question the show seems to ask is the following\u00a0: \u201cwhat's a hikikomori?\u201d. But the one it is answering to would rather be \u201cwho is Satou?\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nSatou is not depressed. Satou is not paranoid either. And finally, Satou isn't really oppressed by a close environment that's forcing him to have a certain lifestyle. But then, you'd ask, Satou is still a recluse, frightened by social interactions \u2013 and when he panics he speaks with its house furniture. But the way the show progresses makes it easier to understand and identify what is really problematic for our anti-hero. We get this by learning to know the people that Satou becomes friend with. These others characters are \u2013 by the way they impersonate specific issues \u2013 the ones that inform us about what Satou is suffering from. Or rather what he does not suffer from...\\n\\n\r\nSatou seems paranoid. And well he probably might be if he was not too busy being too lost to be able to engage in any particular direction. But the episodes that bring his senpai Hitomi into the story let us know that Satou is not the one inventing those absurd conspiracy theories. It's none other than Hitomi that truly believe in this shit and that chick is a real nutcase. While Satou is constantly hesitating and not really consistent in his delusions, Hitomi is shown as a strongly resolved character. Conspiracies are everywhere, there's no other explanation for life. She is calm and seems very confident. She lives with the insurance (and the resignation) of a person that knows a truth that she is the only one to be aware of. When Satou speaks about conspiracy, it's in a ludicrous way \u2013 either thanks to a directing trick or because of Satou's erratic behavior. But when Hitomi speaks about it, she's cold and dead serious. Until the collective-suicide arc (where Satou rushes once more without thinking into something to which he doesn't understand anything), wherein from the 4 candidates to group self-termination Hitomi is the only one that stays firmly resolved until the very end. And if Satou ends up trying to jump, it is not because of some firm resolve but because it's the first thing solution that comes to his mind to avoid the frustration and shame of having been deceived during this whole arc, and to avoid having the life he fantasized with Hitomi shattered before his eyes.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you hear or read about hikikomorism (is that even a word?), you often hear people talking about social pressure as a possible cause for the syndrome. It's a well-known fact that the expectations of society and family in Japan can be quite phenomenal. But is Satou really feeling this pressure ? He may speak about it from time to time, but then again isn't it some ready-made sentences he heard here and there (probably on TV since he spends most of his time at home in front of a screen). After all his parents are treating him, giving him money thanks to the state's help, and the serie doesn't explicitly tells us that they are harassing him in any way \u2013 even though we can see Satou having a hard time when he learns that his mom is on her way to visit him. He seems actually quite free to live his life the way he decides. But there's one character in the show that will have his life taken in charge by forces beyond his control: Yamazaki. Satou's neighbor, blowhard and angry otaku, Yamazaki will lead Satou into the world of visual novels and thousands of lolis. And while this guy seems pretty confident and all \u2013 despite hiw own life issues \u2013 the last twist of the show will unveil the true stakes of his character. Yamazaki was the only solid constant of Satou's recent life, even more solid than Misaki towards whom Satou is still feeling ambivalent, and now we learn that was just escaping from his fate. Although he is usually so stubborn and strongly independent, he cannot escape to the call of the country and goes away to replace his injured dad. The break-up is brutal and definitive. This twist in Yamazaki's life doesn't just deeply break our certainties, it also hits the very fragile balance in Satou's life. In this part of the show, he's almost without income, and all he's got left in his life is Misaki.\\n\\n\r\nAaah... Misaki. The smiling Misaki. The ingenue Misaki. The fragile Misaki. The intriguing, incomprehensible Misaki. Angel fallen from the sky to save Satou from his miserable life or selfish and despair-driven jail-keeper? While progressing, the story gives many faces to Misaki. Unknown cute girl with dubious intentions, providential friend, potential lover... the circle breaks a first time when Satou experiences the collapse of the myth he built around their \u201cfortune\u201d meeting. Misaki didn't fall from the sky nope. She's been instead fomenting a plan for a long time from her window up on the hill. A window that leads directly to his room and to the park where they meet every night. Even his own flat is her uncle's property. This myth is given the coup-de-gr\u00e2ce during this brilliantly grotesque scene wherein Misaki confesses with a big shout that she needs her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 cause he's the only person she knows that's even more miserable and pathetic that she is. As if he wasn't confused enough, Satou is now even more lost than before. The truth is so simple though... and deadly so. Misaki's had a shitty life, from abuses to abandonment. Now that she's turned 17, the only mean she finds to keep herself afloat is to create a \u201cproject\u201d for Satou. Well more accurately, for Satou and herself. A contract supposed to link them to each other until death do them part. A contract that could be seen as perverse (since it's contriving Satou into taking care of her under a penalty of 10.000.000 yens) but that seems so pathetic and desperate that it can't be anything but ludicrous. However we don't feel like laughing for once, not at all. Because we feel that the end is coming, we know that it's the poor girl's last chance, the sad ending to their orchestrated relationship. Because we don't have to see Satou's disgusted face to guess the aversion he will show for this proposal that seems so off from what he was expecting. We know then that those two will not find each other. Too much secrecy, too many lies, too much fantasies developed unbeknownst to one another.\\n\r\nAt this point everything speeds up, the show's twist continuing to take effect; though we thought that we had to be concerned only with the situation of Satou, this idiot proves himself capable to survive this and to go get a job once he's hit bottom rock. While Misaki reacts by leaving the city to die. Now it's up to Satou to go and rescue his so-called savior in a final episode so anthological, so strong and rich and emotional that I'd rather say nothing about it in order to left its impact untouched. So what? Satou's depressed? Blow me. Next to Misaki's true face, he looks like a disoriented and whimsical child.\\n\\n\r\n__________________\\n\\n\r\n2nd wandering : Satou-kun is confused. He hurts himself in his confusion.\\n\\n\r\nSatou: \"Question: Why would one want to live a hikikomori life?\\n\r\nAnswer: Because his clothes, his food and his house are guaranteed. Since he always manage to get through it he can allow himself to live like that. Without clothes, food or house you don't have any choice but work. Unless you're prepared to die.\"\\n\\n\r\nI spoke so much about what Satou isn't that I'd almost forgot to unveil the true mystery of his condition. That's not an easy task, cause now that the serie's over and we've arrived at this stage of our train of thought there is but one irrefutable conclusion. One that will probably disappoint you since it seems so obvious and easy : Satou is a human.\\n\\n\r\nWait that's it? That's what all this fuss was about? You made me read that overlong and self-indulgent analysis just to tell me that Satou is humain, you Wazoo bastard?! Yup, exactly. Well. I'm not saying that Satou was NOT human from the start mind you, but by then he was mainly seen as a hikikomori. Then again I'm still not saying that he's not a hikikomori anymore by the end of the show \u2013 though he most certainly improved his condition \u2013 but what I'm saying is that we've slowly ceased to see him through that social-filter that seemed too custom-made for our guy. Satou says he's a hikikomori. Misaki supports him and help him because he's a hikikomori (and profit from it in the long run). Yamazaki is angry with Satou's hikikomori condition and spends most of his time kicking his ass and giving him stuff to do. Hitomi's also profiting from his situation to lure him in a \u201csuicide mission\u201d. Megumi even goes as far as reconnecting with him because she incidentally learns about him being a hikikomori in order to trap him into a big con. NHK ni Yousoko though, teaches us about the distance between the label and the one wearing it. As a matter of fact Satou himself invokes this status whenever it suits him. For example if he refuses to leave his room because he doesn't want to confront his responsibilities then all he has to do is cry to himself: \u201cHa! There's no way a hikikomori could get out of his house two days in a row!\u201d. When other characters get surprised by Satou's leaving his room or other unusual behavior they more or less say this : \u201ca hikikomori is not supposed to do this!\u201d. As does Yamazaki near the end of the show when he throws one of his typical   harsh lines: \u201cYou're forgetting that you ar a hikikomori. It is impossible that a hikikomori would get out and sell stuff.\u201d. That's the snake biting its tail \u2013 Satou's close ones cropping him (probably unconsciously) into this morbid category that he finally escaped from.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway here we are, the 24th episode is over. Now no one is fooled anymore (at least I hope so) : a hikikomori is a facade. Behind which Satou takes shelter whenever he has to justify his inaction in the eyes of anyone including himself. A facade that others take up the way they want to. A hikikomori is a landmark, a reference point requested by Japanese society to shove in a box those that cannot resolve to get in any other one. For some of you what I just said will probably sound as a hackneyed commonplace, but witnessing how the show treats this subject I will gladly emphasize it.\\n\\n\r\nOkay. If we manage to disregard the hikikomori term then what the hell is Satou suffering from? Well, being the good protagonist that he is, Satou is confused. There you go. The word is dropped. It may seem simplistic too although if we really look for the lowest common denominator in Satou's erratic behavior, he really seems to be swimming in a sea of total confusion. Confusion concerning the slightest of his life choices, the least of his actions or feelings. Satou has no idea about what drives him in life and the only prospect of having to care about it terrifies him so much that he has to create farfetched strategies to avoid it. To the point of clumsily evoking the infamous NHK conspiracy for example. And the easiest way of avoiding the confrontation with those existential questionings is to withdraw inside yourself and to keep everything that's bothering you on the outside. Satou's reclusive situation in his flat is nothing but a metaphor for his internal conflicts. He's not afraid of the sun or the crowd, not really. He's rather fearing the way others might look at him. Due to his obsession for postponing the inevitable, he's making a smaller and smaller spot for himself in the middle of the garbage bags symbolizing the responsibilities he left pending in the background. And when you reject with such strength everything that bothers you onto the outside, don't be surprised if said outside starts feeling hostile... \\n\\n\r\nSatou is not inactive though. Admittedly he's not doing anything useful for society, but that doesn't mean he's not consumed by the need of doing SOMETHING. His fortune meetings with the other characters will give him the opportunity to do so : becoming a lolicon, taking pictures of school-girls, work on a visual-novel script, sink into an online-game, etc. Because they are governed by the vital and imperious need to get his brain and body busy while avoiding to reflect on his life, those activities are always approached in a way of instinctive and addictive consumption. When he starts looking for sexy pictures of girls on the internet he ends up spending his whole day collecting an enormous quantity of 'em. When he goes on a trip with his senpai he makes a very quick decision without thinking of anything but an absurd fantasy, etc. Not because he's got nothing to do all day long \u2013 that's the excuse he gives to justify his sudden ascension on his MMORPG \u2013 but because not doing anything all day long would precisely bring the thoughts he tries to ignore on the foreground of his tormented mind. Though is discussion with Megumi's hikikomori brother reveals that maybe it's not too late for him to confront his fears.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the fascinating way that Satou's psyche is depicted in the show, we could add in conclusion to this part that he is the perfect character that allows the series to address a broad specter of social issues. Satou is indeed so confused and manipulable that he can be shown rushing into anything, any kind of situation really, without anything feeling unjustified. If you add the specific talent the creators have to create burlesque then you have the ideal recipe for rich and pathetic over-the-top adventures in sight.\\n\\n\r\n________________\\n\\n\r\n3rd wandering : Where we address the question of the half-filled prozac tube.\\n\\n\r\nWe can now directly focus on a question that often comes to the minds of people reflecting on the series : is NHK ni Yousoko pessimistic?\\n\\n\r\nIt's quite easy to get how the show would be described by some as pessimistic. I mean every character in it goes from failures to bigger failures and there's no guarantee anyone will ever succeed at anything (unlike the vast majority of anime wherein the point is focusing on the way to success). And if the tone of the series is arguably light on the first episodes, the \u201ccollective suicide on your dream island\u201d sets the record straight \u2013 though it might have been more polished of an arc in my humble opinion, it might be an essential one but some of the characters are lacking in depth and credibility. The deeper we progress, the more serious the thematic becomes. The more we end up believing that resistance is futile.\\n\\n\r\nBut let's not forget that for each punch in the gut NHK ni Yousoko tries to tickle our zygomatics in the meantime. The \u201cdesert island\u201d's finale scene \u2013 while being traumatic for various previously evoked reasons \u2013 is also a grotesque projection into caricature (while still maintaining a very realistic directing style). It's one of those key moments when the show challenges us to keep laughing. That's the reason behind all the dark humor in the series: to see up to which point we are capable of laughing at the depressing adventures of Satou & cie. Will the gags & jokes be enough to make us forget the anguish of the last scene?\\n\\n\r\nThough I'd have a hard time stating with confidence that NHK ni Yousoko is an optimistic show, there are many ways to counterbalance the alleged pessimism. Now is the time to highlight two characters I voluntarily skipped earlier. For the penultimate arc of the series makes way for new nominees for the prize of Notorious Failures: Megumi and her brother. Starring Satou's ex class-president's desperate attempt to harpoon him into a massive scam in order to allow her to reimburse parts of the debts she contracted when trying to help her brother \u2013 also a hikikomori though way more serious than Satou's condition. This arc helps us to understand another thing that Satou is not: he is not beyond saving. He didn't contract a formidable debt and is not neurotic enough to become as mightily powerless as Mergumi's brother \u2013 who's fully aware of all the troubles he causes to his sister but can't find the strength to deal with his fears. If Satou didn't have this inhibition that prevents his from moving forward, it wouldn't take more than a few steps in the right direction to make his life balanced again. When those two poor guys enter the show they symbolize Satou's possible future if he doesn't get better. He would become a nuisance for himself and his close ones. The \u201cvirtual\u201d discussion between Satou and Megumi's brother is to me one of the emotional heights of the whole show and a precious and valuable source of understanding Satou's condition and state of mind (and of the whole hikikomori notion in general). For our protagonist now even has a character seemingly telling him: here's what I am that you're not. A hikikomori. There's still hope for you.\\n\\n\r\nBut even then! Even now that the show has set the ultimate standard for despair and hopelessness (and stabbed us in our weakened hope), NHK ni Yousoko indulges itself with a sudden twist. Megumi's con society is seized by justice, her debt is now erased like magic. In the meantime her brother \u2013 that was left starving in his room until the point of almost death \u2013 finally gets out to beg for some food at the local restaurant and ends up with a job as delivery boy. Foreshadowing Satou's situation in the final episodes. Rather than being just a magic-trick, this part oh the show seems to tell us viewers that if those two guys can survive and get back on their feet... well what's stopping Satou from doing so as well? How pessimistic, right guys? In the same spirit, Hitomi seems stable with her plain-as-f*ck boyfriend \u2013 though we may doubt her sincerity, having witnessed all the duplicity she's capable of. Boy she's even expecting a baby! As for Yamazaki, sent against his will in the country and using massive amounts of booze to get acclimated, he's going to be married to a girl he seems to have actual feelings for! In the end there's only Satou left, floundering poorly with his job as a traffic agent but at least he flounders in the right direction. And although he experienced some extreme and uneasy times with Misaki in the very last episode they both came out of it better. Weakened by the sight of their disastrous impulses but strengthened by the acknowledgment of their mutual feelings. They left the series with a saner relationship. Finally, twisting the premise, they both establish themselves as consenting \u201chostages\u201d for the maleficent NHK organization in order to control their destructive impulses. Satou and Misaki seems to have gain enough hindsight on their delirium to play with and manipulate it to make it a life-insurance. And, finally, they can start recovering.\\n\\n\r\n______________\\n\\n\r\nFinal wondering : Alea jacta est\\n\\n\r\nNow would be the time to conclude this endless logorrhea don't you think? I didn't even found the time to address the formal qualities of a show I thought was brilliantly directed. I'm not saying it was technically brilliant, as a matter of fact I thought of the animation as very basic and the drawing very very uneven. But the staging and the directing ideas proved to be what was needed to support the series' purpose. It was realistic, with just enough whim in key moments (for example when Satou is having panic attacks the animation suddenly transforms into gripping imagery and nightmarish scenes). The poor drawing even somehow reinforces the shaky edge of those stupid and battered characters we learned to love and hate. The music is bewitching at times and seems fueled by a strange and blissful melancholy, and contributes greatly to the unique atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nI hope I somehow made my case enough somewhere in all those paragraphs. At least enough so it won't feel feel weird if I start screaming at the top of my lungs that NHK no Yousoko is a vital anime. Non only because I recognized myself in some of his reasoning more often than I dare to admit \u2013 though I'm really not in this kind of situation \u2013 and because I loved hating this stupid coward before slowly getting in tune with his character. But because far from treating an isolated syndrome the show is addressing in its core (and with a unique tone) some universal themes about which everyone is able to relate to. I'm firmly and intimately convinced of that. Take a chance, even if it means emerging disgusted, exceeded or troubled from it.\\n\\n\r\nI'll repeat it again, one last time with all the bombast of which I'm capable of : a VITAL series.\\n\\n\\n\r\n_________________________________________\\n\\n\r\nFRENCH VERSION :\\n\\n\r\nCeci n'est pas vraiment une critique organis\u00e9e de la s\u00e9rie, elle n'est ni tr\u00e8s claire ni concise. C'est plut\u00f4t devenu une esp\u00e8ce d'essai \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 coh\u00e9rent, n\u00e9vros\u00e9, inachev\u00e9 sans doute et centr\u00e9 principalement sur l'infinie richesse du propos de Welcome to the NHK et du personnage de Satou. Pour les n\u00e9ophytes de la s\u00e9rie je spoile \u00e0 balle donc soyez pr\u00e9venus. De toute fa\u00e7on ce papier donnera plut\u00f4t du grain \u00e0 moudre aux connaisseurs de la s\u00e9rie pour approfondir les choses. Allez hop on avale son xanax et on est parti !\\n\\n\\n\r\nWelcome to the NHK d\u00e9barque avec un pr\u00e9misse qui laisse songeur. Pas r\u00eaveur non, plut\u00f4t son jumeau cauchemardesque : Satou est un hikikomori depuis maintenant 3 ans, c'est \u00e0 dire qu'il ne sort pas de chez lui \u00e0 part pour faire ses courses, est effray\u00e9 \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e d'avoir un contact avec qui que ce soit et se sent \u00e9cras\u00e9 par la pression sociale qui est mise sur ses \u00e9paules de citoyen japonais. C'\u00e9tait bien parti pour \u00eatre glauque et d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9 comme savent si bien le faire les nippons. D'ailleurs la s\u00e9rie sait \u00eatre volontiers sordide, souvent pessimiste et \u00e0 l'occasion abjecte. Mais tout n'est pas si simple : Welcome to the NHK est aussi pleine d'humour. Elle n'oublie pas que m\u00eame dans les plus grands malheurs (surtout dans les plus grands malheurs) il y a toujours le besoin, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 vitale de trouver du risible. Pour rebondir, pour ne pas s'offrir en sacrifice \u00e0 l'angoisse et au vide. Pour rester en vie. Et donner corps au bon mot plein de sens de Pierre Desproges : \u00ab Quelle autre \u00e9chappatoire que le rire sinon le suicide, poil aux rides ? \u00bb. Et disons-le d'embl\u00e9e, c'est probablement la plus grande force de la s\u00e9rie que de parvenir \u00e0 rebondir par une pirouette comique pour continuer \u00e0 approfondir ses th\u00e9matiques sociales et personnelles et \u00e9laborer son propos sans virer au glauque pour le seul plaisir pervers de donner la mis\u00e8re humaine en spectacle pour les spectateurs assoiff\u00e9s de larmes et de sang.\\n\\n\r\n__________________\\n\\n\r\nPremi\u00e8re errance : Montre moi tes potes et je te dirai qui tu es.\\n\\n\r\nLa grande question que semble poser la s\u00e9rie est la suivante : \u00ab qu'est-ce qu'un hikikomori ? \u00bb. Celle \u00e0 laquelle elle r\u00e9pond, du moins en partie, serait plut\u00f4t \u00ab qui est Satou ? \u00bb.\\n\\n\r\nSatou n'est pas d\u00e9pressif. Satou n'est pas non plus parano\u00efaque. Et Satou, enfin, n'est pas  vraiment oppress\u00e9 par son entourage qui attend de lui un certain style de vie. Mais pourtant, me direz-vous, Satou est reclus chez lui, est effray\u00e9 \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e de voir quiconque et parle avec son mobilier lors de ses crises de panique. Mais le d\u00e9veloppement du show permet de mieux cerner ce qui bloque vraiment notre anti-h\u00e9ros. Cela, on le comprend \u00e0 mesure que l'on voit Satou se lier avec les autres personnages. Ce sont eux, dans les probl\u00e9matiques qu'ils incarnent, qui nous renseignent sur ce dont souffre Satou. Ou plut\u00f4t, ce dont il ne souffre pas.\\n\\n\r\nSatou para\u00eet parano, et il pourrait s\u00fbrement l'\u00eatre s'il n'\u00e9tait pas trop paum\u00e9 pour \u00eatre incapable d'emprunter une route en particulier. Mais les \u00e9pisodes qui font intervenir sa senpai Hitomi laissent entendre qu'il ne tient ses th\u00e9ories conspirationnistes que de cette nana, qui elle est une vraie cingl\u00e9e en la mati\u00e8re. L\u00e0 o\u00f9 Satou est constamment h\u00e9sitant et peu consistant en la mati\u00e8re, Hitomi donne l'image d'une personne r\u00e9solue. Les conspirations sont partout, il ne peut en \u00eatre autrement. Calme et d'apparence s\u00fbre d'elle, Hitomi vit avec l'assurance de celle qui connait une v\u00e9rit\u00e9 dont personne n'est conscient. Lorsque Satou parle de conspiration, c'est sous l'angle du risible aussi bien par effet de mise en sc\u00e8ne que par le comportement du personnage ; lorsque Hitomi \u00e9voque le sujet, c'est avec un s\u00e9rieux glacial. Jusqu'\u00e0 l'arc du suicide collectif, o\u00f9 une fois de plus Satou fonce t\u00eate baiss\u00e9 dans quelque chose auquel il ne comprend rien, parmi les 4 candidats \u00e0 l'autolyse de groupe Hitomi demeure la seule \u00e0 \u00eatre fermement r\u00e9solue. Si Satou a cette impulsion finale de sauter \u00e0 sa perte, ce n'est pas \u00e0 cause d'une quelconque r\u00e9solution ferme, mais parce que c'est la premi\u00e8re chose qui lui passe par la t\u00eate pour \u00e9viter la frustration et la honte d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9 en bateau, on me pardonnera l'expression, durant tout cet arc, et pour \u00e9viter de voir sa vie fantasm\u00e9e avec Hitomi voler en \u00e9clat.\\n\\n\r\nUne cause souvent \u00e9voqu\u00e9e lorsqu'on \u00e9voque le pourquoi du syndrome hikikomori est la pression sociale. On le sait bien, au Japon, que les attentes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et de l'entourage peuvent \u00eatre assez faramineuses sur le pauvre citoyen. Mais Satou a-t-il vraiment cette pression ? Il peut sans doute l'\u00e9voquer \u00e0 quelques reprises, mais l\u00e0 encore ne s'agit-il pas de phrases toutes faites qu'il a entendu \u00e0 droite \u00e0 gauche, probablement \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9 devant laquelle il passe une bonne partie de son temps ? Apr\u00e8s tout ses parents l'entretiennent sans qu'il soit fait mention dans la s\u00e9rie d'une quelconque attente de leur part envers leur fils \u2013 bien que Satou se mette occasionnellement la pression lorsque sa m\u00e8re d\u00e9cide de venir lui rendre visite. En l'\u00e9tat, il est relativement libre de faire ce qu'il veut de sa vie. En revanche, il y a bien quelqu'un qui va voir sa vie \u00eatre prise en main par quelqu'un d'autre : Yamazaki. Voisin de Satou, otaku vantard et col\u00e9rique, il va entrainer Satou dans le monde des visual novels et des lolis par milliers. Et s'il appara\u00eet s\u00fbr de lui en toutes circonstances, malgr\u00e9 ses propres complexes et mis\u00e8res amoureuses, le dernier tournant de la s\u00e9rie nous fera d\u00e9couvrir les v\u00e9ritables enjeux de son personnage. Lui qui apparaissait comme la seule constante solide de la vie r\u00e9cente de Satou, plus solide finalement que Misaki envers qui Satou entretient des sentiments ambivalents ; le voil\u00e0 qui d\u00e9voile qu'il ne faisait qu'\u00e9chapper depuis tout ce temps \u00e0 un destin tout trac\u00e9 qui finit par le rattraper. Appel\u00e9 \u00e0 la ferme pour prendre le relai de son p\u00e8re souffrant, oblig\u00e9 de se soumettre au d\u00e9sir parental \u2013 lui qui est d'ordinaire si born\u00e9 et ind\u00e9pendant \u2013, la rupture est brutale et d\u00e9finitive. En plus de nous d\u00e9stabiliser profond\u00e9ment en remettant nos certitudes en cause, ce virage de la vie de Yamazaki terrasse l'\u00e9quilibre pr\u00e9caire de Satou. Qui, quasiment priv\u00e9 de revenus \u00e0 ce stade de la s\u00e9rie, n'a alors plus que Misaki pour le maintenir \u00e0 flot.\\n\\n\r\nAaah... Misaki. La souriante Misaki. L'ing\u00e9nue Misaki. La fr\u00eale Misaki. L'intrigante, incompr\u00e9hensible Misaki. Ange descendue des cieux pour sauver Satou de sa vie mis\u00e9rable, ou bien ge\u00f4li\u00e8re \u00e9go\u00efste en proie au d\u00e9sespoir ? La progression du sc\u00e9nario vient donner de nombreux visages \u00e0 Misaki. De l'inconnue aux intentions douteuses on passe par l'amie providentielle, la potentielle amante... un premier cycle se brise lorsque Satou vit la chute du mythe de leur rencontre. Misaki n'est pas tomb\u00e9e du ciel non, elle fomente un plan depuis longtemps, depuis sa fen\u00eatre l\u00e0 haut sur la colline, qui donne droit sur la baie vitr\u00e9e de l'appartement de Satou, appartement dont son oncle est le propri\u00e9taire. Doute r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 au grand jour lors de cette sc\u00e8ne grotesquement brillante o\u00f9 Misaki avoue \u00e0 grands cris avoir besoin de son prot\u00e9g\u00e9 car il est la seule personne de sa connaissance \u00e0 \u00eatre plus mis\u00e9rable, plus path\u00e9tique qu'elle-m\u00eame. Comme s'il n'\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 suffisamment confus, Satou sait de moins en moins o\u00f9 donner de la t\u00eate. Alors que la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 est si simple... d'une simplicit\u00e9 mortelle. Misaki a eu une vie de merde, tout y est pass\u00e9 des abus aux abandons. Alors qu'elle atteint ses 17 ans, le seul moyen qu'elle trouve pour se maintenir \u00e0 flot est de pr\u00e9parer un \u00ab projet \u00bb pour Satou. Enfin pour Satou et elle. Un contrat qui est cens\u00e9 les lier tous les deux jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la mort les s\u00e9pare. Un contrat qui aurait pu s'av\u00e9rer pervers vu qu'il oblige Satou \u00e0 prendre soin de Misaki sous peine de lui devoir une somme de 10.000.000 yens, mais qui perle tellement le path\u00e9tique qu'il ne peut \u00eatre autre chose que risible. Pourtant, pour une fois, on n'a pas envie de rire. Parce qu'on sent bien qu'on arrive au bout, que c'est la derni\u00e8re chance de la jeune fille, le triste aboutissement de la relation qu'elle a \u00ab orchestr\u00e9e \u00bb avec Satou. Parce qu'on a pas besoin de voir la r\u00e9action d\u00e9go\u00fbt\u00e9e de Satou pour deviner l'aversion qu'il affichera pour cette proposition en complet d\u00e9calage avec ses propres attentes. On sait alors, avec certitude, que ces deux-l\u00e0 ne se trouveront pas. Trop de cachotteries, de mensonges, de fantasmes d\u00e9velopp\u00e9s \u00e0 l'insu de l'autre. \\n\r\nAlors tout s'acc\u00e9l\u00e8re et le twist de la s\u00e9rie poursuit son office ; alors qu'on pensait devoir se soucier avant tout de la situation pr\u00e9occupante de ce bougre d'\u00e2ne de Satou, celui-ci s'av\u00e8re capable de survivre \u00e0 ses \u00e9checs successifs d\u00e8s lors qu'il atteint le fond du fond, et de se bouger pour trouver un job \u2013 ingrat, mais c'est d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e7a. Misaki en revanche, une fois confront\u00e9 \u00e0 cette impasse, s'en va mourir au loin. C'est alors \u00e0 Satou qu'il incombe de tenter de sauver sa pseudo-sauveuse dans un \u00e9pisode final si anthologique, si fort et riche en retournage de boyaux \u00e9motionnel que je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re ne rien en dire pour ne pas en d\u00e9naturer l'impact. Alors quoi ? Satou, d\u00e9pressif ? Mon \u0153il. \u00c0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du vrai visage de Misaki, il donne l'air d'un gamin d\u00e9sorient\u00e9 et capricieux.\\n\\n\r\n__________________\\n\\n\r\nSatou-kun est confus. Il s'inflige des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts.\\n\\n\r\nSatou :  \u00ab Question : Pourquoi vouloir vivre une vie de hikikomori ? \\n\r\nR\u00e9ponse : parce que ses v\u00eatements, sa nourriture et sa maison lui sont garantis. Vu qu'il trouve toujours un moyen de s'en sortir, il peut se permettre de continuer \u00e0 vivre comme \u00e7a. Sans v\u00eatement, sans nourriture ou maison, tu n'as pas d'autre choix que de travailler, \u00e0 moins de te pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 mourir. \u00bb\\n\\n\r\n\u00c0 force de parler de ce qu'il n'est pas, on en oublierait presque de lever le voile sur la v\u00e9ritable condition de Satou. Pas simple car une fois la s\u00e9rie finie, et \u00e0 ce stade de la r\u00e9flexion, on ne peut arriver qu'\u00e0 une seule conclusion, qui vous para\u00eetra peut-\u00eatre d\u00e9cevante tant elle semble \u00e9cul\u00e9e et facile : Satou est humain.\\n\\n\r\nTout \u00e7a pour \u00e7a ? Ouais, tout \u00e7a pour \u00e7a. Ce n'est pas qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas humain au d\u00e9but de la s\u00e9rie, c'est plut\u00f4t qu'il \u00e9tait hikikomori. L\u00e0 encore, ce n'est pas non plus qu'il cesse de l'\u00eatre \u00e0 la fin de la s\u00e9rie \u2013 quoique sa condition se soit am\u00e9lior\u00e9e \u2013 mais plut\u00f4t qu'on cesse de le voir \u00e0 travers ce filtre qui semblait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 trop parfaitement taill\u00e9 pour lui. Satou dit qu'il est un hikikomori. Misaki le \u00ab prend en charge \u00bb parce qu'il est un hikikomori (pour en tirer profit sur le long terme). Yamazaki est r\u00e9volt\u00e9 par sa condition de hikikomori et passe le plus clair de son temps \u00e0 lui remonter les bretelles et lui donner des trucs \u00e0 faire. Hitomi aussi tire profit de sa situation pour l'attirer avec elle dans une \u00ab mission suicide \u00bb. Megumi va jusqu'\u00e0 renouer contact avec lui parce qu'il est un hikikomori pour l'attirer dans une arnaque. Seulement toutes ces p\u00e9rip\u00e9ties nous ont montr\u00e9 la distance qu'il existe entre l'\u00e9tiquette et celui qui la porte \u2013 contre son gr\u00e9 ou non. Satou lui-m\u00eame invoque ce statut quand \u00e7a l'arrange ; s'il refuse de sortir de chez lui pour affronter ses responsabilit\u00e9s il n'a qu'\u00e0 s'en d\u00e9charger en se criant \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame : \u00ab Ha ! Il n'y a aucune chance pour qu'un hikikomori sorte de chez lui deux jours d'affil\u00e9e ! \u00bb. Lorsque les personnages s'\u00e9tonnent de ses faits et gestes, eux-m\u00eame ont plus ou moins cette formulation : \u00ab un hikikomori n'est pas cens\u00e9 faire \u00e7a \u00bb (par exemple lorsque Satou se met \u00e0 sortir naturellement de chez lui sans se rendre compte que c'est anormal). \u00c0 l'image de Yamazaki balan\u00e7ant en fin de s\u00e9rie une de ses vacheries habituelles : \u00ab Tu oublie que tu es un hikikomori. Il est impossible qu'un hikikomori sorte pour vendre des trucs \u00bb. C'est le serpent qui se mord la queue, les proches de Satou qui le recadrent sans s'en rendre compte dans cette cat\u00e9gorie mortif\u00e8re dont il s'\u00e9tait enfin momentan\u00e9ment \u00e9chapp\u00e9.\\n\\n\r\nEnfin voil\u00e0, le 24\u00e8me \u00e9pisode est fini, maintenant plus personne n'est dupe (je l'esp\u00e8re) : un hikikomori c'est une fa\u00e7ade. Derri\u00e8re laquelle Satou s'abrite lorsqu'il doit justifier son inactivit\u00e9, et dont les autres se saisissent pour en faire ce qu'ils veulent. Un hikikomori, c'est un point de rep\u00e8re qu'exige la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nippone pour mettre dans une case ceux qui ne peuvent se r\u00e9soudre \u00e0 entrer dans les autres. Pour certains, ce que je viens d'\u00e9crire sonnera sans doute comme une banalit\u00e9 \u00e9hont\u00e9e, mais vu la mani\u00e8re dont en traite la s\u00e9rie c'est avec plaisir que j'insiste dessus.\\n\\n\r\nBon, si on fait abstraction du terme, il est quoi finalement Satou ? Eh bien en bon protagoniste, il est confus. Le mot est lanc\u00e9. Il para\u00eet simpliste lui aussi, mais pourtant si on cherche le plus petit d\u00e9nominateur commun au comportement erratique de Satou, c'est bien qu'il semble nager dans la plus totale confusion. Confusion \u00e0 propos du moindre de ses choix de vie, de la moindre de ses actions, du moindre de ses sentiments. Satou n'a aucune id\u00e9e de ce qui l'anime dans la vie, et la simple perspective de devoir s'en soucier le terrifie jusqu'\u00e0 mettre au point des stratag\u00e8mes abracadabrantesques. Jusqu'\u00e0 \u00e9voquer maladroitement la conspiration de la NHK, par exemple. Et le plus facile, pour ne pas avoir \u00e0 affronter toutes les questions existentielles et pratiques que notre monde a \u00e0 offrir, c'est encore de rester clo\u00eetr\u00e9 en soi et de garder tout \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur. L'isolement de Satou dans son appartement n'est qu'une m\u00e9taphore de ses luttes int\u00e9rieures. Il n'a pas peur du soleil, ou de la foule, enfin pas r\u00e9ellement, il a surtout peur de se confronter au regard des autres ; \u00e0 force de repousser l'in\u00e9vitable, de se frayer une place de plus en plus r\u00e9duite au milieu des sacs poubelles symbolisant ses responsabilit\u00e9s laiss\u00e9es en plan, il se condamne \u00e0 ce que l'ext\u00e9rieur lui apparaisse de plus en plus hostile. Ce n'est pas pour autant que Satou est inactif. Certes il ne fait rien d'utile \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, mais ce n'est pas pour autant qu'il n'est pas rong\u00e9 par le besoin de faire **quelque chose**. Ses rencontres avec les divers persos lui en fourniront l'occasion ; devenir lolicon, photographier des \u00e9coli\u00e8res \u00e0 la sortie du coll\u00e8ge, bosser sur un sc\u00e9nario de jeu, partir en voyage, s'enfoncer dans un jeu en ligne... Parce qu'elles sont dict\u00e9es par la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 vitale d'occuper son cerveau et son corps tandis qu'il \u00e9vite d'avoir \u00e0 se pencher sur sa vie, ces activit\u00e9s sont toujours abord\u00e9es sur le mode d'une consommation instinctive et addictive. Lorsqu'il se met \u00e0 chercher des photos de nanas sur internet il y passe sa journ\u00e9e et collecte inlassablement une \u00e9norme collection, lorsqu'il part en voyage avec sa senpai tout juste retrouv\u00e9e c'est sur une d\u00e9cision prise \u00e0 la va-vite bas\u00e9e sur des fantasmes absurdes et concoct\u00e9s \u00e0 toute vitesse. Etc, etc. Pas parce qu'il n'a rien \u00e0 faire de la journ\u00e9e, comme il l'invoque pour justifier son ascension soudaine sur son MMORPG, mais parce que ne rien faire ram\u00e8nerait les interrogations pressantes dont il ne veut rien savoir. Satou est plus que ravi d'avoir quelque chose pour occuper son attention et dans lequel s'engouffrer pour ne plus penser \u00e0 rien d'autre. Sa discussion avec le fr\u00e8re de Megumi, hikikomori lui aussi \u2013 mais \u00e0 un stade bien plus \u00ab profond \u00bb, \u00ab aigu \u00bb ou \u00ab grave \u00bb que Satou \u2013 ach\u00e8vent de faire douter Satou et de le mettre face \u00e0 l'inavouable : il n'est pas encore trop tard pour qu'il s'en sorte, pour affronter ses peurs.\\n\\n\r\nAu del\u00e0 du caract\u00e8re psychologique fascinant de la fa\u00e7on dont est trait\u00e9 le personnage de Satou, il est \u00e9galement le sujet parfait pour permettre \u00e0 la s\u00e9rie d'aborder une vaste quantit\u00e9 de sujets et de probl\u00e9matiques ; Satou est tellement manipulable qu'il peut s'engager dans n'importe quoi sans que cela paraisse random ; son caract\u00e8re et sa probl\u00e9matique permettent de tout justifier. Ajoutons \u00e0 cela le talent de la s\u00e9rie pour le burlesque et voil\u00e0 de belles et riches aventures path\u00e9tiques en perspective...\\n\\n\r\n___________________\\n\\n\r\nTroisi\u00e8me errance : O\u00f9 l'on cause du tube de Prozac \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 plein\\n\\n\r\nOn peut d'ailleurs en venir directement \u00e0 une question qui vient souvent \u00e0 l'esprit de ceux qui s'interrogent sur la s\u00e9rie : est-elle pessimiste ? Optimiste ? \\n\\n\r\nIl est assez facile de voir en quoi on pourrait voir Welcome to the NHK comme une s\u00e9rie pessimiste. On passe d'\u00e9chec en \u00e9chec, les persos ont une vie de merde et les. Et si le ton est assez l\u00e9ger sur les premiers \u00e9pisodes, le passage par l'arc \u00ab suicide collectif sur l'\u00eele de vos r\u00eaves \u00bb remet vite les pendules \u00e0 l'heure (quoiqu'il aurait pu \u00eatre plus marquant et plus soign\u00e9 \u00e0 mon humble avis ; pour essentiel qu'il soit, les personnages qui s'y trouvent bross\u00e9s manquent de relief et parfois m\u00eame de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9). Plus on s'enfonce dans la s\u00e9rie, plus les th\u00e9matiques \u00e9voqu\u00e9es deviennent graves, ou glauques, et plus on se dit qu'il est vain de lutter.\\n\\n\r\nMais ce serait oublier que pour chaque taquet on a le droit \u00e0 un \u00e9clat de rire. La sc\u00e8ne finale de l'arc \u00ab \u00eele d\u00e9serte \u00bb, justement, est \u00e9galement une plong\u00e9e dans un grotesque qui cherche la caricature \u2013 tout en gardant un style de r\u00e9alisation tr\u00e8s r\u00e9aliste \u2013 c'est un de ces moments o\u00f9 Welcome to the NHK nous met au d\u00e9fi de rire. C'est ce que fait la s\u00e9rie \u00e0 chaque fois avec son humour noir ; voir jusqu'\u00e0 quel point on peut rire des aventures en dents de scie de Satou & cie. Est-ce que les gags marcheront, suffiront \u00e0 nous faire oublier l'angoisse de la sc\u00e8ne pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente ?\\n\\n\r\nS'il sera difficile d'affirmer avec toute l'assurance du monde que Welcome to the NHK est une s\u00e9rie optimiste, on peut tout du moins contrebalancer le pessimisme qu'on lui pr\u00eate. C'est le moment d'\u00e9voquer deux personnages cl\u00e9s laiss\u00e9s (volontairement) de c\u00f4t\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, et reprendre bri\u00e8vement l'analyse de personnage faite un peu plus haut.\\n\\n\r\nCar l'avant-dernier arc laisse appara\u00eetre une nouvelle venue dans le palmar\u00e8s de rat\u00e9s notoire : Megumi, et plus tard son fr\u00e8re. Avec \u00ab l'arc Megumi \u00bb, qui montre l'ancienne d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9e de classe de Satou en train de tenter de harponner celui-ci dans une arnaque afin de rembourser des dettes qu'elle-m\u00eame a accumul\u00e9 pour venir en aide \u00e0 son fr\u00e8re (lui aussi hikikomori). Alors on comprend que ce Satou, dont on a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tabli tout ce qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas ; n'est pas non plus au del\u00e0 de tout secours. Il n'est pas sous l'emprise d'une dette qu'il ne pourra jamais rembourser, pas plus qu'il n'est si profond\u00e9ment enfonc\u00e9 dans sa n\u00e9vrose qu'il atteint le niveau d'impuissance du fr\u00e8re de Megumi qui se retrouve \u00e0 faire souffrir consid\u00e9rablement ses proches tout en en ayant conscience, mais sans trouver pour autant la volont\u00e9 d'affronter sa peur. S'il n'y avait ce blocage qui emp\u00eachait Satou d'aller de l'avant, il suffirait de quelques pas dans la bonne direction pour r\u00e9tablir un \u00e9quilibre dans sa vie. Lorsqu'ils apparaissent dans la s\u00e9rie, ces deux larrons symbolisent un futur possible qui attend Satou s'il n'am\u00e9liore pas sa condition. Il deviendrait une nuisance autant pour lui-m\u00eame que pour ses proches. Le dialogue \u00ab virtuel \u00bb entre Satou et le fr\u00e8re de Megumi est un des sommets \u00e9motionnels de la s\u00e9rie, et une source pr\u00e9cieuse de compr\u00e9hension de l'\u00e9tat de Satou et de celui de hikikomori en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Car finalement, dans ce p\u00e9nulti\u00e8me chapitre de la s\u00e9rie, Satou se retrouve face \u00e0 un personnage qui semble dire : voil\u00e0 ce que je suis et que tu n'es pas. Un hikikomori. Pour toi l'espoir est encore permis. \\n\\n\r\nEt pourtant, apr\u00e8s avoir pos\u00e9 cet \u00e9talon de la r\u00e9clusion et du d\u00e9sespoir comme un coup de poignard dans notre espoir faiblissant, la s\u00e9rie s'autorise un revirement de derni\u00e8re minute. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui emprisonnait Megumi est saisie par la justice. La dette de Megumi est effac\u00e9e. Et au m\u00eame moment, son fr\u00e8re qui s'appr\u00eatait \u00e0 mourir litt\u00e9ralement de faim parce que sa s\u0153ur n'\u00e9tait plus \u00e0 la maison pour lui apporter de la nourriture depuis plusieurs jours, sort de chez lui pour aller mendier de la nourriture au restaurant du coin. Et se retrouve du m\u00eame coup avec un boulot de livreur dans la poche. Comme en pr\u00e9diction \u00e0 la situation de Satou dans les \u00e9pisodes finaux. Ces deux-l\u00e0 finissent par s'en sortir par un improbable coup du sort. Pessimiste, la s\u00e9rie ? Si eux peuvent \u00e9merger d'une merde si noire, alors qu'est-ce qui nous emp\u00eache d'esp\u00e9rer qu'il en soit de m\u00eame pour Satou ? De m\u00eame, Hitomi \u2013 m\u00eame si on peut d\u00e9cemment douter de sa sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 vu la duplicit\u00e9 dont elle est capable \u2013 semble s'\u00eatre stabilis\u00e9e (r\u00e9sign\u00e9e?) avec son copain chiant comme la pluie et attendre un b\u00e9b\u00e9. Quant \u00e0 Yamazaki, envoy\u00e9 contre son gr\u00e9 chez les bouseux et se plongeant dans l'alcool pour supporter sa vie \u00e0 la ferme, il cl\u00f4t la s\u00e9rie en annon\u00e7ant un mariage imminent avec une fille dont il semble amoureux. Il ne reste finalement que Satou, qui patauge certes avec son job pourrave \u00e0 la circulation, mais au moins il patauge dans la bonne direction. Et s'il a v\u00e9cu des moments sacr\u00e9ment extr\u00eames et d\u00e9rangeants avec Misaki dans le dernier \u00e9pisode, ils en ressortent tous les deux grandis, \u00e0 la fois fragilis\u00e9s par leurs impulsions calamiteuses et renforc\u00e9s par la r\u00e9alisation de leurs sentiments r\u00e9ciproques. Ils quittent la s\u00e9rie avec une relation bien plus saine qu'au d\u00e9part. Ultime pied de nez au pr\u00e9misse, ils s'engagent tous les deux par \u00e9crit \u00e0 se constituer comme \u00ab otages \u00bb volontaires de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 mal\u00e9fique NHK pour contr\u00f4ler leurs pulsions auto-destructrices. Satou et Misaki semblent avoir suffisamment de distance avec leur d\u00e9lire pour en jouer et le manipuler \u00e0 leur guise pour se cr\u00e9er une assurance vie. Et enfin, comment \u00e0 se reconstruire. \\n\\n\r\n_______________\\n\\n\r\nErrance finale : Alea jacta est\\n\\n\r\nIl serait peut-\u00eatre temps de conclure cette interminable logorrh\u00e9e, qu'en pensez-vous ? Je n'aurai m\u00eame pas \u00e9voqu\u00e9 les qualit\u00e9s formelles d'un anim\u00e9 que je trouve superbement r\u00e9alis\u00e9. Pas tr\u00e8s bien dessin\u00e9, ni m\u00eame bien anim\u00e9, ses choix de mise en sc\u00e8ne cependant \u00e9pousent parfaitement son propos : r\u00e9aliste, avec juste ce qu'il faut de fantaisie aux moments cl\u00e9s (lors des crises d'angoisse de Satou l'animation se transforme soudainement, d\u00e9ployant une imagerie saisissante et des sc\u00e8nes cauchemardesques sorties d'on ne sait o\u00f9). Le trait peu assur\u00e9 du dessin renforce m\u00eame, quelque part, le c\u00f4t\u00e9 branlant de ces personnages un peu cr\u00e9tins et caboss\u00e9s. La musique elle est envo\u00fbtante et teint\u00e9e d'une \u00e9trange m\u00e9lancolie bienheureuse, qui contribue grandement \u00e0 donner \u00e0 la s\u00e9rie son atmosph\u00e8re bien \u00e0 elle.\\n\\n\r\nJ'esp\u00e8re en tout cas avoir suffisamment d\u00e9fendu mon cas pour pouvoir crier sur tous les toits que Welcome to the NHK est une s\u00e9rie vitale. Pas seulement parce que, sans \u00eatre du tout dans la situation de Satou, je me suis retrouv\u00e9 dans beaucoup de ses raisonnements et me suis reconnu bien plus souvent que je n'ose l'admettre, que j'ai ador\u00e9 d\u00e9tester cet idiot de poltron avant de m'identifier progressivement aux enjeux de son personnage. Mais parce que, bien loin de traiter d'un syndrome isol\u00e9, la s\u00e9rie aborde en son c\u0153ur et avec un ton unique, des th\u00e9matiques universelles au rythme desquelles tout un chacun est capable de vibrer, j'en suis intimement convaincu. Pour peu qu'on laisse de c\u00f4t\u00e9 sa mauvaise foi, quitte \u00e0 ce qu'on en ressorte exc\u00e9d\u00e9, \u00e9c\u0153ur\u00e9 ou troubl\u00e9.\\n\\n\r\nJe le r\u00e9p\u00e8terai une derni\u00e8re fois, avec toute l'emphase dont je suis capable ; une s\u00e9rie vitale.",

            "content": "I have written a review of Welcome to the NHK before, but I recently noticed that I gave it a much higher score than I meant to and decided to rewrite the review. The original review was much longer, consisted of a point by point breakdown of original concept, characters, long-form and episode to episode narrative and other bells and whistles like visuals and voice acting. I'm actually a guy who very much values visuals in film and I think it's criminal to avoid talking about them in reviews, so to get it out the way I'm going to open with a succinct analysis ofthese visuals before I get to the meat of the review.\\n\\n\r\nThey basically always suck. The show looks pretty ugly all the time, the colour design is barely considered and it doesn't move much. That being said the character designs are strong enough that there's a good deal of emotion expressed through the character acting, and the characters themselves generally look okay during stills, especially Misaki.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, with all that superfluous rubbish out of the way, I must move on to the reason I decided to review this show. NHK is widely praised in the anime community for its realistic and nuanced portrayal of hikikomori. Maybe it's a bit rich for me, a man with a job and friends to be telling the hikikomori what does and does not constitute a realistic and nuanced portrayal, but I feel that NHK by and large completely fails to do anything of the sort.\\n\\n\r\nThe neet regum we have the pleasure of following is Satou Tatsuhiro, a hikikomori. But you knew that didn't you? Everyone knows what this show is supposed to be about before going in, it's a show that makes you laugh AND depressed! I personally feel that this reputation is not conducive to good analysis, since it seems there's some kind of confirmation bias in play here that means very few people notice how inconsistent the extent of Satou's mental illness is.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 1 is an extremely strong example of all the tricks NHK uses to get you to empathise with this character, I think. Satou lounges around a horrid cheap apartment, stacked floor to ceiling with bags of rubbish, and muffled sugary J-Pop is piped in from the mysterious outside world. Satou seems simultaneously lethargic and tense, he's trapped in his own mind, making inane observations about his environment and his emotions. What's refreshing about NHK immediately is that Satou, while a social recluse, is not an otaku. His whole existence is defined by cigarettes and slimy boxes, which is altogether much more grim I think. I am instantly curious about what the show is going to do with this character.\\n\\n\r\nAfter a chance encounter introduces him to cute girl Misaki, Satou goes on a bit of a manic rant, in line with his clearly unhinged persona, the one you knew about going in. He retreats back into his cave. At this point it's clear that Misaki is some kind of angel sent from above in order to serve an obvious narrative purpose, she's got the big eyes, the childish innocence and the girlish voice of an obvious waifu. Shortly after this encounter Satou decides to stop being a hikikomori and sets out on foot with r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to get a job. Wait, what? I thought he had crippling social anxiety, how is he just going to go out and seek employment on a whim caused by an embarrassing encounter with a cute girl? Already this is pretty annoying, as it hugely undermines the work the episode does early on to set up Satou's persona. We are then treated to a somewhat comedic scene in which he runs into Misaki once more, but this time rather than a dread inducing manic rant Satou responds to Misaki with a more conventional awkward bluster, typical of cringe comedy; and believe me when I say the comedy in this show is typical.\\n\\n\r\nIt's at this point that the viewer receives the blueprint for what the show becomes throughout, a series of inconsistent comedic escapades interspersed with excellent scenes exploring Satou's vague anxieties. If you want a description of one of these scenes there are plenty of glowing reviews for this show elsewhere on MyAnimeList you can go to I guess. I'm sure at least one (1) of them has attempted to analyse why this show is effective, and doesn't just lather it with praise for so many paragraphs, right? Anyway I didn't bother counting the times that Satou acts in a completely different way to the way he should, but it's definitely frequent enough for it to be a problem. It doesn't end up happening more often as the show progresses, as if to imply that he is changing as a person. It just kind of happens randomly in order to facilitate certain plot events that would otherwise be difficult to write.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters besides Satou have their own strengths and weaknesses, none of them have the depth that Satou is given by his good scenes but none of them suffer from his convenient split personality disorder. One of my favourite scenes in the show has Satou confronted with a screaming parasitic hikikomori, an extreme case of his own condition that serves as a reminder of what Satou could have been without the influence of his friends. The mystery of Misaki and her involvement with Satou is a strong enough narrative through-line that I was convinced to watch to the end, but while not egregiously terrible her own motivations upon revelation are peppered with the same contrivances I had grown to expect from Satou.\\n\\n\r\nOriginally the ending of the show seemed satisfying enough that it convinced me to give this shows a positive score. I may have been suffering from lack of sleep while writing that last review, but then my eyes slide down to the bottom right corner of my monitor and notice that it's 4am, and I think to myself that I may indeed have to rewrite THIS review at some point as well. I then relay these thoughts in the body of the review, thus satisfying my own compulsion to inject an element of self indulgent meta-commentary in everything I write.",

            "content": "I first watched \"Welcome to the NHK\" as a middle-schooler, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Since then, I've re-watched the whole series two other times; as a high school student and a college student. For some time, I've also had the show's \"Pururin\" as my ringtone.\r\nThe protagonist's story is extremely relatable for almost everyone. It is a coming-of-age story that explores the mentor-pupil relationship, friendship, and romance. However, it is extremely relatable for those who have struggled through mental illness, fear, and paranoia. As someone who was diagnosed with major anxiety disorder as a high school student, and further diagnosed as bipolar with paranoid tendencies, \"Welcometo the NHK\" was a way for me to express to my loved ones, in a more palatable way, a visual depiction of my fears and inner demons.\\n\\n\r\n\"Welcome to the NHK\" is also very funny. The protagonist's inner dialogue, dialogue with the supporting cast, as well as the situations he is faced with, are very charming and entertaining. His flaws, weaknesses, essentially his \"human-ness\" is what makes him so likable. The character's story arc is well-paced and has good viewer pay-off. \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this for those who enjoy stories with NEET protagonists, people who like to laugh, and those who are also struggling with mental illness, or maybe even self-improvement and getting out of one's comfort zone.",

            "content": "Short version: \r\nA brilliantly written, poorly animated series that deals with heavy topics, but uses comedy to prevent the series from becoming overly solemn. Uncomfortable to watch, especially if these themes hit close to home, but still worth experiencing if you can handle it. Psychologically fascinating, intelligent, and often funny.\r\nLong version:\r\nThe moment that I knew this show would get to me happened early in the series. The protagonist, in self-directed fury and frustration, chokes himself; after a few angry seconds, he lets go and casually notes that he'd pass out before it would kill him anyway. This show is DARK. This series has some ofthe most uncomfortable and downright painful moments I've ever sat through. Handled differently, the show would be unbearably depressing, especially with its Nihilistic message. Thankfully, this does not happen, and the audience is treated to some of the finest dark humour the medium has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's strength lies in its writing, primarily in the characters and themes. The characters of this show struggle to find even a slight sense of purpose or happiness. The inhabitants of Welcome to the NHK aren't seeking grand purposes and going on mighty adventures, they are fundamentally flawed and/or broken people who desperately want a reason to keep living and working. Satou, the protagonist, is a delusional, self-loathing shut-in who initially cannot leave his apartment without having a near breakdown. He has no idea where his place is in the world, and needs a hallucinatory conversation with his appliances before he can convince himself to leave his home.\\n\\n\r\nThe show isn't dark because everything happens to the characters, but rather because they get themselves into their situations. The protagonist falls into schemes, addictive habits, and worse with a blithe energy that is almost as terrifying as it is humorous. There are also quiet moments that add a real weight to the series. For much of the narrative, Satou is helping an ambitious friend with a dream project that will ideally launch his career. Every accomplishment is muted by the oft-spoken question of \u201cis it worth it?\u201d Some of the most heartbreaking moments come from this plot-line, because of how insignificant it all feels. You can feel these characters struggling with the fact that it will only matter if they can succeed.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the art must be mentioned. It ranges from passable at best to downright ugly at worst. There are entire episodes that are just unpleasant to look at. Not for any artistic point, the show just looks bad, to the point that I wouldn't be surprised if that alone makes some people drop the show. There is one fairly impressive shot in the first episode, and it is repeated so many times over the course of the series that I found it annoying by the end. If visuals are the most important thing in a series for you, look elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other major flaw with the show is the connection between arcs. The lead character needs a reason to bumble from one awful circumstance to the next, and while the reasons why he does so often make sense, it usually feels rushed. Some might find the philosophy a bit ham-fisted, especially when characters outright break into existential ramblings, but it never lasts long enough to be grating, at the least. I personally found some of the slapstick annoying, but most of the jokes are quite good. The OST is passable, neither exceptionally impressive or unimpressive. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not discussing the plot here because, frankly, the plot isn't what makes the show. It's a psychological exploration of what it means to keep going when there doesn't seem to be any point. I first watched this series during my last year of university, and it terrified me. Satou's situation was everything I feared my life might become.\\n\\n\r\nI feel it also necessary to address the fact that some people find the show ridiculous. I've seen reviews from people who think it stupid that the main character becomes a shut-in \u201cfor no reason\u201d or that he's just a coward. The show is sometimes exaggerated, yes; it's fiction, it has to be in order to cover everything it wants to. These criticisms fall apart quickly. There are people who feel like this. There are people who cringe at some of these punchlines because of how much it reminds them of their own lives. There are some people who will find this show too much to handle because of its themes and its bleak tone. \\n\\n\r\nIt may not resonate with you, and you may find the art unforgivable at times, but if you are even slightly interested in Welcome to the NHK, I recommend you give it a chance.",

I just watched the end, and I feel like I played a VN and totally messed up.\r\n!! (Now you could say what follows is a sort of spoiler.) !!\r\nIs it just me or is this ONE kiss scene at the end really NOT necessary? Why a thirdcontract?

Is the fact, that this was NOT Sato\u00b4s answer, the proof that this anime wasn\u00b4t going to get a romance at all? Why had those 3 wonderful words to perish in the confusion of a simple discussion? Why were there no feelings? ...Was it just a fake? Was love implemented to show even more sorrow? Just to show the sorrow that brings love with itself?\\n\\n\r\nWould the \"meaning\" of the story has changed if Sato and Misaki had kissed then? Why the joke at the end? The story was like a perfect empty canvas. They could have painted the most wonderful image of the world on it. But in the end, in the last episode, they made a mistake. It\u00b4s not just the missing kiss. I can\u00b4t explain exactly what mistake they did. \\n\\n\r\nBut one thing\u00b4s for sure. I am not happy with the end.

            "content": "~~ENGLISH & ESPA\u00d1OL REVIEW~~ [9,5/10]\r\nWelcome To The NHK is not an anime that one sees for mere entertainment, because it goes from the tragicomic humor, to the most depressing, to the philosophy of each character or everything together that is enclosed with a very strong dose of reality.\r\nHistory: 10/10\r\nThe story revolves around Satou Tatsuhiro, a hikikomori who could not be properly integrated into society because of his way of being and little strength to face things, forcing him to leave the university when he started it and shut himself up all day in his apartment with nothing to do, being supported by his parents, aftera few months he meets Misaki Nakahara and starts a beautiful story between them. The story and the plot of Welcome To The NHK are beautiful, but beautifully depressing, it takes the time to present each character with detention and know their facets without looking like an information overload, the arches change in a fluid way without being force absolutely nothing, with constant climatic moments and extremely emotional and reflective that from nowhere appear to give a good 'shock' to the one who sees the series. At the same time it is good that the story and the message are so powerful to be hard with the characters and their weaknesses but showing them in one way or another the options to get out of that hole in which they are.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nProbably the weakest section of the whole series, it's actually good, but sometimes the animation loses quality and becomes quite average, while in others it becomes very psychological and they use their resources very well, it's not something at all disastrous, but it is the great achilles tendon of this series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in general is fine, and as far as the soundtrack is concerned, it fits perfectly in each moment of the anime and with the atmosphere which the plot or address wants to give, the issue is that it is not something very outstanding in terms of the auditory , but it is very good generally.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion it is the strongest section of 'Welcome To The NHK', all the characters contribute something to the plot so that it moves in a fluid way, but not only that, when you think you know each one well, you always Surprise someone with something else that you did not know about them. Especially the 3 most important characters (Sato-Misaki-Yamazaki) which always surprise you with something and make you experience all kinds of emotions and reflections where, regardless of each facet of these 3, is very easy to identify yourself and understand what they pass.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Welcome To The NHK is one of the best animes I've seen, it only fails in artistic direction to be very average, but the story and the characters are excellent and it becomes depressing to empathize with them so much, but it's a journey of reflection of 24 episodes that is totally worth it if you want to see a good story to remember.\\n\\n\r\n9,5/10 = 9/10\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nWelcome To The NHK no es un anim\u00e9 que uno vea por mero entretenimiento, porque pasa del humor tragic\u00f3mico, a lo mas deprimente, a la filosof\u00eda de cada personaje o todo junto que se encierra con una dosis muy fuerte de realidad.\\n\\n\r\nHistoria: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLa historia gira en torno a Satou Tatsuhiro, un hikikomori que no pudo integrarse de una forma correcta a la sociedad por su forma de ser y poca fortaleza para enfrentar las cosas, forz\u00e1ndolo a abandonar la universidad cuando la empezaba y encerrarse durante todo el d\u00eda en su departamento sin nada que hacer, siendo mantenido por sus padres, despu\u00e9s de unos pocos meses conoce a Misaki Nakahara y empieza una linda historia entre ambos. La historia y la trama de Welcome To The NHK son hermosas, pero hermosamente deprimentes, se toma el tiempo de presentar a cada personaje con detenci\u00f3n y conocer sus facetas sin que parezca una sobrecarga de informaci\u00f3n, los arcos cambian de una forma fluida sin que se fuerce absolutamente nada, con constantes momentos clim\u00e1ticos y extremadamente emotivos y reflexivos que de la nada aparecen para darle un buen 'shock' al que ve la serie. A su vez es bueno que la historia y el mensaje sean tan potentes al ser duros con los personajes y de sus debilidades pero mostr\u00e1ndolos de una forma u otra las opciones de salir de aquel hoyo en el cual se encuentran.\\n\\n\r\nArte: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nProbablemente el apartado mas flojo de toda la serie, en realidad es bueno, pero a veces la animaci\u00f3n pierde calidad y se torna bastante promedio, mientras que en otras se vuelve muy psicol\u00f3gica y utilizan muy bien sus recursos, no es algo para nada desastrozo, pero es el gran tend\u00f3n de aquiles de esta serie.\\n\\n\r\nSonido: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEl sonido en general est\u00e1 bien, y en cuanto al soundtrack respecta, encaja perfecto en cada momento del anim\u00e9 y con la atm\u00f3sfera la cual la trama o bien la direcci\u00f3n quiera dar, el tema es que no es algo muy sobresaliente en t\u00e9rminos de lo auditivo, pero queda muy bien generalmente.\\n\\n\r\nPersonajes: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nA mi parecer es el apartado mas fuerte de 'Welcome To The NHK', todos los personajes aportan en algo a la trama para que se mueva de una forma fluida, pero no solo eso, cuando crees que conoces bien a cada uno, siempre te sorprende alguien con algo mas que no conoc\u00edas de ellos. En especial los 3 personajes mas importantes (Sato-Misaki-Yamazaki) los cuales siempre te sorprenden con algo y te hacen experimentar todo tipo de emociones y reflexiones donde sin importar cada faceta de estos 3, es muy f\u00e1cil identificarse y no entender lo que les pasa.\\n\\n\r\nEn conclusi\u00f3n, Welcome To The NHK es uno de los mejores anim\u00e9s que he visto, solo falla en direcci\u00f3n art\u00edstica al ser muy promedio, pero la historia y los personajes son excelentes y llega a ser deprimente empatizar tanto con ellos, pero es un viaje de reflexi\u00f3n de 24 episodios que vale totalmente la pena si quieres ver una buena historia la cual recordar.\\n\\n\r\n9,5/10 = 9/10",

I am willing to sacrifice 20 delicious years of beautiful moments with my family and my girlfriend, just to fully enjoy this show one more time.\r\nFirst: this show is not you if you're looking for a story about a man just struggling with his hikikomori \"disease\". No no no, it's far more than that.\r\n\"NHK ni Youkoso\" reflects on many, many problems that Japan has. (Warning: mild spoiler in this part) Like the NEET/hikikomori, online game addiction, the pyramid scheme, suicide rate, and so on.And they took such a serious topic, garnished it with some comedy without making it a mess. Bravo\\n\r\nThis show brings you an emotional roller coaster with a jet engine attached to the car and at least 30 litres of oil on the rail. Along the way you will see the  main character fighting back against his fear of the eyes of judgment, while trying to fit in the society. And he is so well written that you could almost feel like you're enduring this with him.\\n\r\nHonestly, the quality of this show is amazing, and can't be put into words. I'll try to edit this review as soon as possible when I finish my university course to earn my PhD in Review Writing.",

            "content": "So, this anime still remains on the top of my top 10 list for a few reasons, and while I think it's difficult I'll try to explain why this is my personal top anime.\r\nFor starters the slice of life genre (especially nowadays) is inherently packed with both good and bad animes, but many seem to have a sub-theme to follow. Romance, friendship, grief, and other themes of daily life become \"the one\" essential focus for an entire series. While Welcome to the NHK has it's goal laid out from the start, it does three things differently from these shows:\r\n1. It stresses that not one singlething causes you to be the way that you are. The protagonist goes through multiple failings on many levels to realize why he is the way he is. He has personal failings, failings in relationships, in jobs, in motivation, in self-assurance, and he also has enablers of his lifestyle. The main character didn't just wake up one day and become what he was; he slowly developed his worst personalities over time.\\n\\n\r\n2. Characters that are friends aren't infallible. This is a big one for me. So often in other shows about \"getting over and obstacle\" your friends give infallible information that you take to heart one day and \"BOOM\" you're changed forever. Welcome to the NHK doles this out slowly. His friends are giving him advice constantly. While sometimes it benefits him to follow, he often finds out that there were ulterior motives to their help and assistance. This assists the show in showing that even selfish beginnings don't necessarily preclude it from being helpful.\\n\\n\r\n3. It shows that people are vulnerable. Shows often try to show that a character is \"weak,\" but that's not quite what needs to be shown or portrayed. Weakness implies that one isn't able to overcome their own obstacles, while vulnerability shows that you can have the tools for success yet still fail. If pressure is applied to someone in the proper way, they can be pushed from the wrong course or corrected to the right one. Characters in this show often reach their lowest point, and yet life keeps kicking them like it's a soccer match in over time. There isn't a moment of epiphany where someone learns to change or to give up. Instead, it's a constant struggle against who you don't want to become yet are destined to be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show does human emotions and reactions almost too accurately for comfort. The characterization of this show is probably the most amazing that I feel I will ever see. It's well worth a watch for the laughing and crying you'll experience along with the journey of self-salvation the character has to go through to reach his climax.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. The opening is one of the best I have ever seen, and only adds to the uniqueness of the show.",

            "content": "The first few episodes of Welcome to the NHK are fantastic. I enjoyed them so much that I was assuming the rest of the series would be just as good, if not better. But then, the series took a huge dive and became a living nightmare. \r\nWelcome to the NHK follows Tatsuhiro Satou, who is the living embodiment of an otaku. He spends his days inside playing games, reading manga, and doing other stuff that isn't out of the ordinary for a hikikomori (someone who is reclusive and isolated). Soon, he meets a girl, named Misaki, who wants to help Tatsuhiro with his problems. \r\nIthink the best place to start with Welcome to the NHK is the animation. It's beautiful. A good chunk of the series is incredibly colorful and full of life. Characters seem real and blend well with the world around them. It's not groundbreaking or anything, but definitely something worth noting. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in the series is not all that memorable, but it works. With that said, the OP is quite catchy. It definitely sets the mood for the episode starting right after (Well.... most of the time). \\n\\n\r\nWelcome to the NHK suffers deeply in two important areas - story and characters.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, I loved Welcome to the NHK immensely during the first half of the series. I was enjoying the jokes, rooting for characters, and having an overall good time. But man..... things took a turn for the worse during the second half. I'm not going to go into spoilers, but I'll say this as vaguely as possible because I think it's fair to warn people beforehand. All the comedy in the first half is completely obliterated during the second half of the series. It gets dark - really dark. In fact, it got to a point where I thought I was watching a horror/drama type of series. I was so frustrated during the second half of Welcome to the NHK that I thought of dropping the series many times. I just couldn't believe what was happening. Perhaps this is how the original source material played out. If so, I am more than confused with why so many people enjoy such a thing. I probably would've been calmer had the series started off dark and continued down that path for the rest of the time. \\n\\n\r\nBecause of the shift in tone, characters also change - and not for the better. Tatsuhiro is a character that has mental problems, clearly. There's no denying that. These mental problems stay with him the entire series. The difference is that the first half plays up his problems for laughs, which work quite well. The second half pushes his mental problems to a new level and his character, who I liked in the first half, became my worst enemy. I hated him with a passion and wanted his character to die.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to Misaki, I had no idea what to think of her character. She's just weird. For some reason, she seems to want to form a relationship with Tatsuhiro. It doesn't make much sense. She clearly sees that he's a pervert and has mental problems that keep him from living a normal life, yet, she constantly tries to get closer and closer to Tatsuhiro. Not only that, but I think it's quite obvious that Tatsuhiro has no interest in Misaki at all. I never once thought that he wanted to be in any relationship with Misaki, whether it be friends or more. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series went on, more and more characters were being introduced. Then, it dawned on me what was going on. Every single character in this series has mental problems. It's not just Tatushiro, Misaki, and Kaoru (Tatsuhiro's neighbor). No, it's everyone. When I realized this, I knew that the series was not going to get any better. I had no characters to root for and felt trapped.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Welcome to the NHK is an anime that starts off quite strong, but slowly works it's way to the bigger picture, which isn't funny at all. I wish that the series stayed with it's original tone, rather than change everything up.",

            "content": "This show changed my life. \r\nI started anime pretty recently, and have watched dozens so far. I'm not a huge fan of sol/dramas, I'm mostly into anime like Cowboy Bebop and Trigun but also psychological ones such as Death Note and Perfect Blue. However, only a certain few anime were able to strike something within me, to make me feel something, to make it something memorable to me. Welcome to the NHK did this throughout the entire anime for me. \r\nAfter a long day feeling stressed about work/school, I found out about this show from it being talked about in a reddit post. Since Ifelt stressed and wanted to relax, I watched the first episode. This first episode has become my favorite to any anime so far. It establishes it's world, it's characters, and it's atmosphere perfectly. I ended up watching the entire thing in 4 days for how well the episodes were done. Once completing, I felt so empty. I don't think any other anime can give me the expirience I had while watching Welcome to the NHK.\\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe story was very well done for the show. It's a pretty simple concept, a guy who's a shut-in NEET one day gets visited by a girl who promises to get him out of this state and get more comfortable with society. The guy, Satou, believes the reason why he is the way he is is because of a conspiracy group called the NHK, in which they use anime to turn men into NEETs. They take this simple concept however and do so much with it, making me constantly interested at what would happen next in the story. The show tackles a lot of Japan's social issues and how these people struggle in life. It was very serious and dark at times, but had it's moments where you burst out laughing. The interaction/dialogue between the characters sounded very natural for who the characters were and how they spoke with each other to progress the plot could be funny or absolutely heartbreaking. There were some arcs in the show I thought were weaker then others, and thought it could've ended better, but these things aren't bad in the slightest and were still very enjoyable along with the other amazing arcs in this show.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show was another thing that really stuck out to me. Instead of having characters with exaggerated features, NHK has a more pulled-back art style, making the characters look more human. This particular art style fits with the shows tone perfectly. There were certain episodes where the characters looked a little weird, but it's nothing terrible and still fits with the show. The art in the opening for the show is also very surreal and is nice to sit through. Some of the shots for the many different settings in the show are done perfectly. Some shots being super impactful at times. \\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nMost underrated soundtrack for an anime. Some of the songs such as \"Hitori Bocchi\" when played at certain scenes make you feel all kinds of emotions. The opening song too is also super catchy and has been stuck in my head, along with the \"Pururin\" constantly played throughout the show. The Japanese voice actors for this show fit well with their characters, and in some scenes shined in what their voice can do, especially Satou's. I haven't watched the english dub, but heard many good things about it, so if you want to watch in english you'd probably enjoy the show a whole lot too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are written great. They have flaws, but that's what these characters are supposed to have. I have never connected more to a character in any anime than I have with Satou. Being pretty anti social myself at one point, his character perfectly matches what it feels to be a shut-in. The other characters Misaki and Yamazaki are very well written too and don't appear what they seem to be at first glance. I won't say too much to avoid spoiling, but these characters were very interesting and brought something new to the table for me that I haven't seen in an anime yet. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis shouldn't be a surprise. Even though there were moments that I thought were weaker than others, I was fully entertained throughout the entire show. I loved watching just how Satou's life was changing and how Misaki and Yamazaki affected him throughout the show. The music and shots of the show never failed to keep me bored. This show has become one of my favorites, and I view it as an underrated masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10)\\n\\n\r\nI was super impressed with what this show offered and am sad that I may never find anything like it again. If you are planning to watch this show anytime soon, I hope you enjoy it as much as I have. And know that this review may be a conspiracy by the NHK.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Anime: Welcome to the NHK\r\nTitle: Will have you in fits of laughter\r\nAbout the Anime: Tatsuhiro Sato is a university dropout and a \"hikikomori\" \u2013 a person suffering from social withdrawal. To Sato\u2019s dismay, his self-imposed exile from the world is rudely interrupted when a mysterious girl knocks on his door. She has charged herself with the task of curing Sato of his hikikimori ways! Now, as new problems ranging from hentai games to internet suicide spring up, can Sato manage to overcome his hermit-like ways, or will the imaginary N.H.K conspiracy force him to remain a hikikomori forever?\r\nStory 8/10: Note: Nope, haven\u2019t read the mangayet.\\n\r\nAlmost nothing is better than watching a show that exceeds all of your expectations. I jumped into this series expecting a polished rehash of the same old theme that almost all ecchi shows have: namely, one (or more!) cute girls inexplicably falling for an insultingly spineless Keitarou-clone loser. However, this GONZO work is not, by any stretch of the imagination, your average nerd-meets-girl. On the contrary, Welcome to the NHK! is a remarkably strange series \u2013 one that happens to be among the best of the year.\\n\r\nWhat makes the series so excellent is that it manages to work well on not one, or two, but three levels.\\n\r\nThe first level is the one most people will enjoy the show for: namely, a witty romantic comedy involving quirky characters in unusual situations. Most of the laughs in the show come from the protagonist, Satou, a loveably dysfunctional shut-in whose tendency to fall headfirst into social problems is tempered only by his relentless paranoia. Most of his personality is developed through internal monologues, which, as with Kyon from The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi, quickly flesh him out into a likeable, albeit bizarre, protagonist. Coupled with some equally strange but equally appealing supporting characters, Satou leaps from one anti-social obsession to another in rapid-fire succession. The bizarre situations Satou finds himself in, coupled with his strange personality, make for plenty of laughs and give the show a good deal of charm.\\n\r\nThe second level is less immediately appealing, but is nonetheless fascinating. Alongside the comedy, NHK provides insightful commentary on Japans many societal problems. By unwittingly finding himself in the middle of some of Japan\u2019s most dysfunctional circles, Satou acts almost as a medium through which the audience can see usually distant and abstracted problems up close in frightening detail. From the internet suicide chat-rooms to the NEET shut-ins, the anime gives faces, motives and reasons to these important and alarming statistics. In the end, in addressing real-life problems in Japan, this is probably the most honest and believable anime out there.\\n\r\nFinally, there is a third level that surfaces most near the end. Put simply, NHK is in part a desperate search for meaning in a vast and lonely world. One of Satou\u2019s most telling lines is, \"I am alone in the universe.\" His inability to relate with society almost forces him to be what he is \u2013 a lonely, emotionally neutered husk of a human being. This theme carries over to the supporting characters as well; each troubled soul searches endlessly for some hope, some iota of meaning, and always comes up short due to his or her own insecurities and idiosyncrasies.\\n\r\nWhile this anime could have been good with just the first two \u201clevels\u201d of entertainment, the third level is really what makes the show. There is an underlying sense of poignancy running through the entire work; even as I laughed at Satou\u2019s numerous shortcomings, the sad truth is that I saw a lot of myself in his exaggerated character. As individuals who necessarily live at least somewhat on the fringe of society, I suspect other anime watchers will have similar thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 7/10: I was a little apprehensive to see GONZO helming this series. However, unlike other anime by the studio, GONZO doesn\u2019t allow over-produced animation to interfere with the show. While at times the show is quite visually innovative (particularly when Satou is in the throes of some wild personal fantasy), for the most part the studio plays it straight. The result is a visual look that seldom wows, but provides a solid backbone for the story to rest on.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: The sound, on the other hand, is great. An impressive array of seiyuu performances is led by Koizumi Yutaka, whose fevered and thoroughly erratic rendition of Satou borders on transcendent. For music, I particularly enjoyed \u201cPurupuru Pururin,\u201d a deliberately inane JPop song that pokes fun at the musical taste of anime-watchers. The rest of the soundtrack is suitably zany, with a solid OP by Round Table and a hilarious ED.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9.5/10: As mentioned in the story section, Satou really steals the show here as the loveable anti-hero. The other characters usually just act as foils to him, but are generally interesting in their own right as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8.5/10: As a whole, Welcome to the NHK! is a landmark achievement for the year. Besides the fact that some people may find the transition from comedy to drama awkward, I\u2019d recommend this to just about everyone. No other anime this year has appealed to me in so many different ways.\\n\r\n~WhiteBakemono",

            "content": "Just finished this anime, and I was relatively delighted with its overall effect.  NHK was not much like the scenario I initially read, and it showed flashes of depth that I found very refreshing.  The story primarily covers Satou's life, and the changes that he goes through as a person.  The action, however, revolves around the characters and their relationships with each other and the world.  I read that the manga covered some serious themes regarding sexuality and drug use which were not as strongly present in the anime version, but it did showcase motifs ofconformity, depression, suicide, self-worth, and a bit of religion.  \\n\r\n    NHK was well-created, but there's really very little that happens over the course of the anime.  It is occasionally funny, but less than the average anime.  I must admit I didn't like the intro and ending songs, but they still felt like they fit well.  In several episodes, NHK had several contained songs, which I felt were placed effectively.  Plus, by the end, I even liked the Pururin song...\\n\r\n     Don't panic if you're thrown off by the conspiracy talk in the synonpsis, because I felt it largely took a backseat to the characters.  Some parts felt a bit staged and frustrating, but overall I enjoyed watching Satou try to find his way in the world, by watching others trying to do the same thing.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE**\r\nStory\r\nWelcome to the N.H.K. is about Tatsuhiro Satou, a NEET and hikikomori college dropout who slowly comes out of his shell (and his room) throughout the series by cultivating a friendship and possible career with his neighbor as well as attending \u201ccounseling\u201d sessions with a seventeen-year-old girl who comes into his life one day. I won\u2019t include any spoilers in this review, but what I will say is that the story always had my attention despite the fact that it isn\u2019t action-packed or fast-paced. The writers somehow managed to achieve a perfect balance of comedy, story progression, and emotion to keep me hooked throughoutevery episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nWhile at first I felt as though this anime had a slightly older art style (I like crisp lines and more saturated colors) it ended up really fitting the overall mood of the anime. The characters are well drawn and their appearances suit their personalities. I have no complaints here, although I wouldn\u2019t say the art is above and beyond expectations. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe music in this anime really lends to the feeling of whatever scene is playing. A few times throughout the series some of the music has lyrics, and if you don\u2019t know Japanese it can be a little difficult following along in subtitles with both what is said and what the music is saying, but this only occurs about two-three times throughout the series and is not really a big deal. I really enjoyed the music in this anime, and felt that it went beyond my expectations. The voice acting was well done, and the sound effects were superb.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nI feel that the characters were multifaceted and well rounded, and their development over the series was believable and well executed (especially with the main character). My one complaint is that I wish we got to see more of Misaki\u2019s backstory and learn more about who she is as a person. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI quite enjoyed this anime. It had a perfect blend of comedy, drama, romance, and psychological/philosophical aspects. \\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nYou will fall in love with this anime if you enjoy psychological/philosophical anime, if you have ever struggled with social anxiety/depression/mental illness in general, or like anime with a message. I can\u2019t stress enough how wonderfully balanced this anime is - there was never a moment where I wanted the episode to be over or I felt that I was watching filler. I was entertained and mesmerized from the first minute right to the very end.",

I thought it was going to be more about the relation between a lone, disconnected guy and the society, but it wound up being something more expected than I had imagined. The characters are great, the subjects interesting and well treated compared to some other animes, but even so I keep on thinking it could havebeen better.\\n\\n\r\nI think with a storyline very concentrated on hikikomori problems and socials issues linked to this, the author could have brought out a very important topic that isn't very treated with seriousness even today. And if I make this suggestion, it's because I think this anime focuses more about romance, love, and what kind of things could happen when you're already socialized with people. It's hard to explain it properly and precisely, but for me this anime tried to link two subjects which don't fit together. At least, this is the impression I had.\\n\\n\r\nI can understand people who loves this anime, and to be honest I have harder time to comprehend myself. This is the first time I have this feeling about an anime, and eventually I think this is because I was looking for something more targeted.",

            "content": "Alright first a little introduction about our anime:\r\nSatou Tatsuhiro, 22 years old, thinks that everything that happens around him is a conspiracy. He even figured out who is behind it all: The NHK, an evil secret company.\r\n-now with this simple mind set, how does he think to move on with his life?\r\nWell, he doesn't. But with the help of people around him, his life takes a giant leap and turn going crazy and wild. This is a great story of character development and change for the better. After starting the anime, i thought that it would go nowhere slow, but hell i was wrong, itwent somewhere. now that is for sure.\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSYNOPSIS:\\n\r\n\"When you think anime, you think otaku. When you think otaku, you think people that dislike other people. Those people become hikikomori (people who shut themselves in).\" So Satou manages to uncover the plot of The NHK (stands for Nihon Hikikomori Kyokai), after three years of shutting himself in (and rapidly approaching the fourth).\\n\\n\r\nIn reality, he is nothing more than a NEET (Not in Employment, Education or Training), desperately in need of a cure from that \"disease.\" He wants to break out from the curse, but going out and getting a job is frightening enough for him. That is until he gets selected for a \"project\"; it is a plan to help hikikomori like him in facing the reality of this world.\\n\\n\r\n-so we now have a general knowledge of what the story brings. Now in depth analysis, i believe that the anime is divided into multiple stories/arc. And this stories/arcs are according to people our main character meet. Now all these mini / side arcs, would help in the build up of our main story/arc. NHK ni Youksos! is partly drama, partly romance, comedic, also a psychological thriller and part slice of life. All this genre are combined to make a mix of emotional rollercoaster of a ride in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\n- It has originality(somewhat), there are times that it was great and times that it was annoying. The art could have been better, but for a psychological type of an anime, it was well done and good enough even, that is why i gave it an 8 = Very Good (according to MAL atleast). Art-wise, there isn\u2019t a major problem, but the quality of it is pretty much inconsistent, whenever there\u2019s a further view of the character, either the fa\u00e7ade or the anatomy of the characters goes off.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\n-well i watched this in english dubbed (because i used my mobile phone and it was a pain to read subs using my phone). I guess the english dud did make a good impression on me about the anime, I will try to watch it in subs though when i get the time. I very much like the music, the opening and endings are very enjoyable and background music is very fitting and do not forget about puririn(haha). The sounds keeps up with the overall depressing tone of the series. If the music was inadequate the anime might have been a little different. (my opinion ofcourse).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\r\n-There is no way in hell that you would dislike a single character in this anime.\\n\r\nThat being said let us try to point out the main line up:\\n\r\n*Tatsuhiro Satou - Our Main Hero. The focus of the story, he starts out as an outcast, a person trapped in fear of the outside. He lives off his parents and he does not do anything to help himself. After a twist of faith, he meets a girl he never saw in the neighborhood before (because he locked himself in [LOL] ). He then tries to befriend said girl, and that is where the story of our anime starts.\\n\r\n*Nakahara, Misaki - Our Main Heroine. The girl meets boy (obviously she is the girl). After seeing Tatsuhiro Satou, she wanted to help him find the courage to go back to the outside world, or in other words change him for the better. Misaki is the type of person not to let anyone down, and she goes to alot of things and measures to help Satou be cured from being a recluse.\\n\r\n*Yamazaki, Kaoru - Our Main Hero's Best friend. Now this guy is a semi-recluse, not like Satou, Kaoru Yamazaki goes to school. This bestfriend also tries to help Satou, they both started a project together to help them achieve a certain goal in life. And to prove that they are not pure recluse who depends on others.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment And Overall 10/10\\n\r\n-Why? Just because it was simple but very capturing. It got my attention through-out the whole 24 episodes. There is more to it than what is in the surface. It is not just about a hikikimori or an otaku. It has more to it than this. It was pleasing every way possible. (atleast to me). I enjoyed it(period).\\n\\n\r\nTo those of you who haven't watched it yet, please do try to find time to watch it. To those who Dropped this anime, or placed it On-Hold, Try to pick it up again and continue to watch. After that, then and only then, that you could criticize this anime. And for those who have finished watching this anime, please do tell me if i had said something wrong in this review. any comment in my profile, or message in my inbox will do. I respect all opinions out there.",

            "content": "Wow, welcome to the NHK was nothing like I expected it to be. My initial expectation was that this series would be something strange and psychological. I saw a delusional protagonist, conspiracy theories and anthropomorphic talking appliances. Automatically I was intrigued, and purchased the complete series expecting to watch a series that might be somewhat reminiscent of \u2018Paranoia Agent\u2019. However, about three episodes in I began to feel immediate regret as it became more and more apparent that I had unknowingly purchased a teenage drama.\r\nThat being said, I could not have made a more serendipitous error. Never before have I seen a series of thisgenre that has more depth and introspection into the tragic issues plaguing the lives of Japanese young people than \u2018Welcome to the NHK\u2019. \\n\\n\r\nThe series gives the viewer a very detailed look at what is like to experience a quarter life crisis; when one is riddled with existential despair and fears the futility of daily life and perceives the ambiguity of ones future with a sense of overwhelming dread. In Japan the frequency and prevalence of individuals experiencing this phenomena is abnormally high to such an extent that many young people develop social anxiety disorder, and agoraphobia. \\n\\n\r\nThe term Hikikomori has been coined by the Japanese people to descried individuals suffering from intense social anxiety. The term NEET is an acronym for the government classification of people, \u201cNot in Employment, Education, or Training\u201d. Tatsuhiro Sat\u014d is both a NEET and a hikikimori. As we follow him and a few of his acquaintances throughout the series we learn more about the socio-cultural circumstances that create a hikikimori and explore many of the socio-cultural phenomena that are afflicting many Japanese. Internet suicide groups, hentai addiction, multi level marketing scams, and MMORPG addiction are only a few of the issues explored in this series.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I give this series an 8, it didn\u2019t blow my mind, but it definitely shattered my expectations. The animation has a tendency to look a little cheap at times, but I enjoyed the soundtrack. NHK has a wonderfully black sense of humor and definitely forced me to reflect on my own post college lifestyle. I know a couple people here in the states that might be considered hikikimori, but I can only imagine how much worse these issues apply to people in the Japanese culture. If you\u2019ve got some free time I\u2019d definitely recommend picking up this series.  \\n",

As many people know, Japanese society can be very demanding, and not all young college students can handle the pressure. Hell, this is true in many societies including the US these days. Since this is such a real world problem, it was a fascinating story detailing the motives behind shutting yourself in and avoiding the world outside. \r\nSatou is so shut in and intimidated by the real world that he believes an imaginary organization named the NHK has a conspiracy against him whenthe series starts. We get to witness him gradually work up the courage to venture outside again and attempt to get his life back into a normal track. He makes friends, we see old love interests that have moved on, and a potential new one. I became very involved in his story and empathetic towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nI haven't found another Anime like this one. I designated it a masterpiece because it was so unique and touching and I felt so connected by the end of the story. I highly recommend this series to anyone.

It immediately explains that the anime will be tackling issues that are very relatable for the anime enthusiast. And indeed, Welcome to the NHK doesn\u2019t disappoint.\r\nWhat really makes it successful is the characterization. The characters are well-moulded. Their flaws are very realistic and relatable. Even though these flaws could make them hateable, they have the opposite effect. They actually make the viewers like them.\r\nTake note that these flaws are supported by the characters\u2019 backgrounds and back-stories, meaning that there are actually legitimate reasonswhy the characters have them. Giving characters backgrounds and back-stories are often used to give the illusion of character depth, but in Welcome to the NHK, the depth is no illusion. It is pulled off really well. And this is thanks to the writing.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the writing, this anime knows what it\u2019s doing. Every episode is full of plot and character development. Nothing is delayed. Nothing is stretched-out. Every minute is worthy to be there. As if that\u2019s not impressive enough, the anime also has a smooth way in moving from one story arc to the other.\\n\\n\r\nThe story arcs are somehow connected with each other through certain plot elements and plot points, so moving from one to the other doesn\u2019t give the impression that a story has just ended and another is about to start.\\n\\n\r\nBut don\u2019t get the wrong idea. Welcome to the NHK has an overall story all right. It\u2019s not just story arcs to the next. The main story is about Tatsuhiro Sato and his struggles as a hikikomori. But from there, the story diverts to different directions, to different story arcs, while still making progress to this story.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I like about the story is its ability to conceal and reveal plot points and twists. It is the kind of story that doesn\u2019t reveal all of its secrets at once.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this anime is not perfect. The biggest flaw I\u2019ve seen is the inconsistency in the animation and art style. Some episodes seem to be very detailed and smooth, while some are so dull that even the viewers who don\u2019t particularly look at the art will immediately spot the difference.\\n\\n\r\nOther than this, I don\u2019t see any flaw that is worthy to be mentioned. The one I said isn\u2019t even an inherent flaw. It appears to be a mere issue in the budget.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t normally include opening and closing themes in my reviews, but I just like the themes of Welcome to the NHK. It\u2019s more of a personal matter. I just love the musical style, especially that of the opening theme and the first closing theme.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think Welcome to the NHK is a very well-written anime. The story doesn\u2019t waste time on unnecessary details, and it flows smoothly. The best part of the story is the amount of realism in it, which could be happy and depressing at the same time, because of the truths it shows. Add in compelling characters and dramatic character interactions, and you have a rollercoaster ride of emotions -- easily recommendable anime.\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR: NHK is about a whole array of characterq that need to realize that they need the world more than it needs them. And therefore it is uplifting. If you're the least bit interested in it's synposis: Watch it. Now! I recommend the sub because it feels that the voices are coming out of the characters mouths rather than beng dubbed over IMO, but it's just a matter of preference I guess.\r\n Wlecome to The NHK plunges us in room 202 of Mita House in Tokyo where Sato Tatsuhiro has locked himself from the outside world for 4 years now. It shows us Sato's hallucinationsthat ultimately lead him to conclude that the NHK -a Popular Japanese televisi... err I meant the Nihon Hikokomori Kyokai- is conspiring to turn the Japanese youth into Hikikomori to... What exactly? \\n\\n\r\n So is NHK ni Youkoso! a show about questioning what's real and what isn't?  \\n\r\nNo, NHK is the opposite. it is firmly anchored in reality and it gives answers and solutiions to questions ranging from \"How do people become Hikikomori?\" to \"Is there a God?\" in a brutally honest way.  The first issue that comes to mind when you are introduced to Tatsuhiro will ultimately be the key factor to the resolution. NHK goes tests out all kinds of hypotheses and goes trough the whole 9 yards of depression and isolation but ultimately delivers a clear simple answer that says so much.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story goes in all kinds of places, taking detours every other episodes. Which would've been a bad thing if it was a lesser show , but the script writers here treat each arc with care. All episodes flesh out a facet of the characters (main, secondary or other) and by doing so, advances the plot. Because NHK is a story about dicovering characters.  \\n\r\nTeeny Tiny ( not very) Spoilerish Anecdote: At some point in the Anime, a character says something in the presence of Sato that sounds like a very harsh thing. This of course made me pause and reevaluate Sato's relationships and background. After a little while a song is played during another scene and that's when I realized that the afromentioned character was actually just singing this one song and the realization  evoked the exact emotion that that particular scene was supposed to evoke. I did the same thing that Sato does trough the whole series: overthinking simple things. You can expect this level of writing when watching this.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: All the characters that this show focuses on are excellent. Each person has a personality that consistent and interesting that truly unveils itself the further we go along. Even characters with Brief appearances have  emotional moments and owerfu delivery (in Japanese, at least). \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: This is the trickiest one. You can easily translate the faces and backgrounds here into real life which benefits the show. Therefore you shouldn't expect amazing looking set-pieces, the style changes once in a while in order to convey a change in mood and all that. The biggest issue I had with it is that some characters look alike which at first made me think they were the same person and I did get confused when the script didn't acknowledge it. Other than that the animation looks rough sometimes in Comedy scenes (That are actually the most consistently depressing parts with few exceptions)  but that seemed intentional to me.\\n\r\nAnecdote: Something I did notice is Hiro's sexual fantasies being more ,uh, stimulating than other instances where we see bare titties Irl. It's the most noticeable part where visual components do all the work and it works. I think that deserves some credit.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The OST is excellent and used excellently. You will notice that the intro loses something unique about half-way trough. Symbolism? Maybe, but it did make me skip the intro.\\n\r\n The sound effects are mostly unnoticeable which means good sound design in my book Except for the knocks on the door and the telephone rings (they always sound somewhat intimidating).\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"Welcome to The NHK\" is a jaw-dropping anime that comes from an honest place and is made with expertise. It's the type of show that I actually can see saving people from the pitfalls this series adresses. All things considered, this is a show on a whole other league that should be watched any and all fans of art 10/10",

            "content": "Welcome to the N.H.K. revolves around the lives of several young-adults all living in or around the city of Tokyo. Many different lifestyles are shown though most of the time the story focuses on the concepts of being a hikikomori, anime otaku, and having most of the characters experience intense feelings of depression and loneliness.\r\nThe main protagonist is Tatsuhiro Sat\u014d, a university dropout entering his fourth year of unemployment. He leads a reclusive life as a hikikomori, ultimately coming to the conclusion that this happened due to some sort of conspiracy. One day just when his life seems entirely unchanging, he meets Misaki Nakahara, amysterious girl who claims to be able to cure Tatsuhiro of his hikikomori ways. She presents him with a contract basically outlining that once a day they would meet in the evening in a local park where Misaki would lecture to Tatsuhiro in an effort to rid him of his lifestyle. During these outings, many subjects are discussed, though they almost always pertain in some way to psychology or psychoanalysis. \\n\\n\r\nThis story is amazing....Enough said.\\n\r\nWhat I like about this anime is that (to me anyway) showed a new light and a new society that I for one did not know existed. It shows the life of a Hikikomori or a NEET (not in education, employment or training) and the struggles he goes through with the outside world.\\n\r\nThe story is well put together and consists of a basic yet captivating plot which easily drew me into the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork aint bad. its decent, I don't know a whole lot about art so I can't say too much. \\n\\n\r\nSound is brilliant. I love the first opening theme being one of my favourites now. Its so gentle and peaceful and fits very well with the anime and it's plot. Let's not forget his ringtone (which I have downloaded too), the famous Pururin ringtone that makes it memorable. It's kinda what got him out his house too. Ahh, Yamazaki, God bless you man!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter is very well done. Sato is NEET so he's characteristics are portrayed quite well and you can clearly see development in his mindset at the end as opposed to the beginning. That fated meeting with Misaki changed it all. She's not too bad a character either, wanting to help Sato no matter what, and along with her back story she makes a great female co-star and waifu :)\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime from the beginning right through to the end, it entertained me thoroughly. You see, this anime feels different to me. Sure in a lot of anime's you feel for the characters, but in NHK you really feel for them, I mean feel it! It doesn't bring tears to the eye but the feeling of happiness and sadness are very apparent and it can hit hard. I like it as it showed a different way of life to me, something I didn't know let alone existed! I find it a shame that a lot of people have not seen the anime or read the manga for that matter. I believe everyone should watch this. It's got it all; you'll laugh, cry with joy, weep in sadness, acknowledge moments of triumph and root for them every step of the way.\\n\r\nIf you haven't seen this anime already, do yourself a favour and go watch it now!\\n\r\nAnd Finally,\\n\r\nWelcome, To The N.H.K.........\\n",

            "content": "Who would've thought watching a show about a guy never leaving his house would be so entertaining?\u00a0\r\nTo put this on simple terms: I loved this anime. There is definitely not another one out there like Welcome to the NHK. I feel like this anime really touched on a emotional subject that most other anime don't. Given that I used to be like Satou myself, and having experienced social anxiety like he did in the anime, I must say it really does a good job showing how social anxiety affects a person's life. Social anxiety isn't the only mental discourse represented either. There are characters thatsuffer from depression and thoughts of suicide as well. We really get to see how these real life situations affect people and what they drive them to do, and I found that very interesting.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe character development was outstanding with everyone, especially our main protagonist. We get to see Satou as he first comes out of his shell, falls back in, and comes out again... several times but with all different causes. It is shown phenomenally and realistically how his life is impacted by the people and things around him, and how his presence in the world impacts and changes those people as well. Watching this anime shows a true visual on how people like Satou deal with the problems he is faced in life and how he overcomes them.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the art style one could say that it isn't the best in the world, and believe me, it isn't, but it does justice on the environment portrayed throughout the series. It's not eye-catching, and in some episodes, you can really tell when the animators got lazy. However for me, I believe it gave the perfect feeling for the type of anime this is. Rather than focusing too much on the art style, it makes the watchers become more intrigued with the plot, and that is what makes this anime perfect. \u00a0\\n\\n\r\nThe music was also amazing. It really captured and expressed the emotional view of the anime. No matter what type of scene was playing, whether it be depressing, funny, determined, whatever, the music did wonderfully at making me put myself in the shoes of the characters and know exactly how they were feeling and what they were going through. Music is always a major part in any show or movie out there. It sets the mood, and makes the watchers connect with the characters, and Welcome to the NHK did an astonishing job with it.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Welcome to the NHK is an anime you do not want to miss. Anyone who has ever suffered from social anxiety, depression, or obsession will find this one extremely relatable and will have a great time watching it. Even those who have't suffered from these mental disorders will find this one intriguing to watch. This has been one of the best psychological anime I have ever seen, and will gladly watch it again some day.\u00a0",

The anime begins all fun and games as the NEET finds a friend (Misaki) who for some reason wants to help him overcomes his issue. For the first halfof the season it's great, there's good times, cringey times, funny times, shocking times and more, but what I wasn't prepared for was how much the anime delves into deep and dark subjects such as being a NEET, suicide and loneliness in the second half. (It doesn't delve deeply but the usage of good character designers, story and art makes it feel this way)\\n\\n\r\nFor me, it was like a mirror was being held to my face and I was seeing my true reflection for the first time. It genuinely made me reconsider my life and how I've been wasting it. You know that feeling in your heart you got when you had just started watching anime and the series was over? The feeling of \"what one Earth am I going to do now\"? The kind of feeling you get when someone has died and you know you'll never see them again...well I was getting this with 5 episodes to go until the end.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is going to emotionally F**K you up. All in all it's a good anime but I won't be watching it again, I just can't. It really is too emotionally draining to do which for me is a first for any anime. I've never liked any anime as much as this whilst at the same time refusing a rewatch which should go to show what I mean.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPOTENTIAL SPOILERS ABOUT THE END BELOW \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWhat always annoys me about a lot of anime is why they have open endings. Why on Earth can't Misaki or Sato just tell the other that they love them. The rest of the cast hooked up so why can't they?! They both love each other but they can't say that?!This is what made this anime go from a 10 to an 8.",

It stimulates emotions that no other anime could do. The characters are different from the basic impressive style you may see in mainstream anime. They have come across harsh events, and keep on facing difficulties. \r\nYou will find out what those people think, and how they handle their thoughts. \r\nIt's an opportunity to widen up your emotial field, without being youthe one affected.\\n\\n\r\nGive a chance to uncommon and unique anime.

            "content": "Welcome to the N.H.K.'s greatest contribution is how effectively it portrays reality whilst conjuring up our demons.  My criticism with it is with how it struggles to tie its pieces together.  Solitude, love, and conspiracies are at times thrown around like a hot potato to whomever is most convenient to portray, but those moments are the best parts.  A vast majority of the show moves from one narrow topic to the next in an annoyingly asinine way, but those few moments where these themes are present in multiples and also consistent are when the show is at its strongest.\r\nThe moments between Satouand Hitomi are the best moments in the show, because they constantly tug you between all 3 major themes of solitude, love, and conspiracy.  The moments between Satou and the other characters lack the conspiracy aspect for all or most of the show, and while sometimes they convey a relatable feeling, for the most part they come off as weak .  The pinnacle of the show is the \"Off\" Meeting episodes, and if I could base my rating on this part alone, I would give it at least an 8.\\n\\n\r\nSo why a 6?  The show keeps trying to distract you from its serious themes, which it does, but the way it does it is often so painfully obvious, with its cheap humor and stereotypes.  The rare times these heavy themes are covertly covered up are fantastically done, such as when bits of Misaki's past are unveiled, but the same magic trick only works again if the viewer hasn't caught on to the trick.",

So being curious I delved into this one not knowing what was in store. I'm glad I did. NHK is about a young hikikomori named Satou, who has delusions about his view on his life and the \"conspiracies\" that surround the world. After a rough start in college he soon dropped out and became a hikikomori, which would follow many revelations even he didn't know could happen. \r\nCharacters are always the best part of anime because theyhold the foundation together. Without good characters, but a good story, the piece as a whole feels hollow and without meaning. But flipped around and it's the opposite. Why? Because good characters can carry a slow story even if the story is non-existent to start (take anime like Lucky Star or K-On! for example). The story here starts slow, but even so, the characters managed to make this anime entertaining enough to keep watching. Of course this is all my opinion based on my experiences. So take it as you like. I loved the characters and how much they adapted over time to their situations. There's real character development here, and that's usually not done so well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I must admit I wasn't expecting too much, but I felt bitter-sweet toward the end. It made me want more, but also felt like a complete whole. I highly recommend you watch this if you're into Comedy and Drama.",

            "content": "After watching this anime back in September and rewatching it again, I've come to the conclusion that this is my favorite anime. Everything about this show was phenomenal and I think everyone should watch it.\r\nThe story starts off the main character, a hikikomori (someone that doesn't leave their house, not in employment or schol) named Satou that hasn't been in school for 4 years. He then meets a girl named Misaki Nakahara. Throughout the story she tries to help him overcome his fear of the outside world. Unfortunately there's always some sort of obstacle in the way preventing him from accomplishing that goal, which alwaysbrought him back to square one. At first some may think that this is an anime about making hentai games, but I can assure you that this isn't the case. This anime is the most realistic depiction of social anxiety and agoraphobia I've seen in anime in general. This anime touches on many topics including social anxiety, depression, suicide, drug abuse, and obviously hikikomori. This anime can be very funny at times, and very depressing at other times. \\n\\n\r\nMost people like this anime because they can relate to Satou and his struggles. As I said before, it's easily one of the most realistic depiction of social anxiety I've seen in an anime. Not only Satou, but the other characters are relatable as well. This brings me to my second topic\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nThe main cast of characters were great and all have a significant impact on the plot. We have Misaki Nakahara, the girl that's helping Satou overcome his hikikomori condition (and yes she does have ulterior motives). We have Yamazaki Kaoru, Satou's otaku friend that actually has a positive influence on Satou's life. We have Hitomi Kashiwa whom unlike Yamazaki, serves as a negative influence on Satou's life. She's the main reason why Satou believes in such stupid conspiracies. Even then Satou develops and accepts the fact that him being a hikikomori is also his own fault. All of these characters have problems on their own and it's interesting to see how they go through these obstacles in their life. \\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, these characters can be very relatable to most people. Misaki is the perfect exmaple of this. She is a character that looks down on others to make herself feel better, and thats exactly what people do in our real world. I know that some people might not be able to relate to it, but even in that case it should still be an enjoyable anime to watch. People can also relate to Satous position, and that's why people like this anime.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I didn't understand when starting this anime is Satou's hallucinations. The anime doesn't really explain this at all. In the manga he hallucinates after taking drugs. That's the one thng from the manga that this anime didn't really explain, but not that big of a problem.\\n\\n\r\nThe difference between NHK and other anime that have NEET's is that this is not only realistic, but more mature in general. Other anime with NEETs/Hikikomori just use it for comedy and don't take it as seriously as this anime did. If you want to watch a more mature anime that addresses topics like social anxiety and hikikomori in general, this is the best option.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like a lot of people don't understand the message that this anime was trying to give. These individuals usually say things like \"I wish I had a Misaki in my life\". These individuals clearly don't understand the message this anime was trying to give. Sure it would be great to have a Misaki in your life, but that isn't the point. The message is that people won't always be there to support you, and you have to take action and better your life yourself. The most sad moment of the show was when Satou had to deal with this himself. The moment he realized that he has to quit being a hikikomori in order to live.\\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\r\nI'll keep this part short. When it comes to music, this anime has some very good soundtracks. Not all of them were THAT good, but it does have a good opening, ending, and background soundtrack. Oh, and that Pururin soundtrack was amazing\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI'll also be keeping this part short since there isn't a whole lot to talk about. The art is obviously pretty good since this is a pre 2010 anime. Most anime around that time objectively have better art than any post 2010 anime. Overall the art is unique.\\n\\n\\n\r\nScores overall\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nMusic: 10/10\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n",

            "content": "Have you ever watched something and have been able to only describe it with the word \"wow\"? That is exactly what NHK is.\r\nStory: 9\r\nAlright, so NHK is about a hikikomori (basically someone who is shut in from society) college dropout by the name of Sato Tatsuhiro, and his life dealing with his condition. This may seem like a bland condition, but the manga author made a brilliant twist by incorporating the idea of NHK, a conspiracy company created in the mind of Sato. This sets way for a very interesting dynamic in Sato's perspective and makes the story of his hikikomori recovery to be allthe more intriguing. \\n\\n\r\nIn short - I just really love the story, it was very, very well done, and I cannot reveal more without ruining the vibe of the show or the plot, thus I hope you bear with me for the rest.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nNo qualms here, chief. I don't believe that i have seen such flawless characters and animation in a show for such a long time, and everything plays out to the vibe of the specific moment, this all adds up imo and makes the show wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nIntro/Outro/OST? All amazing, I could not ask for a soundtrack better suited towards the story and the feelings evoked from the show. Even the little gremlin laughs and voice acting was on point.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nDynamics were perfect. Character relationships were more than I expected and there is very subtle but obvious progression (if that makes any sense). I suppose what I'm saying is that, this is really hard to describe but when you watch it, you'll agree, trust me.\\n\\n\r\nCancel that... I think I can give you a better idea of what to expect. From the start of the show, and each introduction of the characters (excluding the heroine, Misaki), you already have a clear basis of the ideas surrounding the characters and their basic traits that they would exhibit to the public or to friends/acquaintances. What you don't know is that you'll be pulling hairs, clenching fists, laughing with characters, celebrating in your subconscious, or clenching your chest in agony. That's just how well the characters were done, and I give a huge kudos to the author for making such an excellent cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nAlright so I'm not gonna say why I am not giving this section a 9, as it's a spoiler, however I will tell you why it might just be a 9 for you.\\n\\n\r\nNHK is something of a different breed, it shows you the greatness that exists in life, even as a NEET. At the same time it also shows you the various pains that come with it, and especially with Sato's state of life. Both of these disparagingly different lifestyles make this show very fun to watch, and very painful at times too. I remember a few times where I clenched my fist because of certain events and others where I sat with a shitface grin. Trust, this show is highly enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nSorry, community. I just don't round up. As it sits, this is a solid 8-9 anime and is well worth your time, hell I just finished it and I have a midterm in a few days, so that says something about the priority of this anime to my medical degree xD. It isn't so much as a regular rom-com, as it is a representation of someone's imaginative reality, but it does fantastic at that, and I hope you love it as much as I did. Enjoy!",

            "content": "There lies a conspiracy behind this beautiful show.\r\nThis show depicts reality, especially those who are withdrawn from social life basically known as shut-ins/NEETs/Hikikomori. Hence comes our MC 'Tatsuhiro Sato' who believes that the reason behind his hikikomori state is a conspiracy by the organisation N.H.K. In short he's a conspiracy freak, and he'll believe every little shit he's told.\r\nDespite having a romance tag, it focus more on the psychological aspect, and imo it conveys suicidal thoughts, social anxiety in a much better way. Being a mature one the story is well paced with a mixture of sad and humorous moments.\r\nThe characters are really well writtenand the author did a very job depicting the lifestyle and behaviour of such people. Each character had its own mystery, the most notable being Misaki Nakahara( definately protecc material) who reveals her secrets in the last 3 eps.\\n\r\nHaving been released in 2006 the artstyle and soundtracks fits the atmosphere of the story very well. In some instances it reminded me of GTO's art style. \\n\r\nIn short, Welcome to the N.H.K. is a well written, well told and well paced story about an increasingly serious subject matter, which has its fair share of sad and humorous moments.",

You can't have a 'I guess its okay?' feeling cause that's a crime.\r\nStory\r\n------\r\nOkay, so the story is just outstanding. The anime get kind of depressive at moments but it shows how realistic and unrealistic it is. Honestly really surprised with the idea of the anime. You usually see lots of anime with NEETs in them but this just shows the way a NEET could be living. Most anime with NEETs usually show the male MC being an otaku and disgusting and all that then getting all the girls for no damn reason so youcould really distinguish whether NHK or that random out of the world anime that would never happen. NHK really didn't give a good start in my opinion since I felt like dropping it at the third episode or so. But I forced myself to watch until the end since I would just be judging a book by its cover. And may I say it did not let me down. The story is quite unique and a little mysterious. Not too much fanservice but its there alright!\\n\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\n------\\n\r\nNow the art is just amazing for a 2006 anime. I would really much prefer this kind of art style than the ones we have now which are more *too normal?*. When the art is different than most anime these days and the art looks real great, it is just a total win. Loved how they did not use CGI or at least I did not see any. Maybe the cars were CGI? But even so not that bad.\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n------\\n\r\nPURUPURUPURURIN! Oh my god that song is so catchy and annoying but honestly not as bad as it is >.<. Honestly Teekyuu's opening is much worse in my opinion. The OP is okay. ED is fine too. Voice acting is real good. So can't really say much here.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n------\\n\\n\r\nThereare times where Sato is just a fag so I can't give this a 10/10. Misaki is so damn cute and innocent but she was kinda an 'attention seeker' but she has her reasons (revealed on last episode). Yamazaki... Well Kinda sad he did not end up with who I intendely ship him with (I mean who else was there to ship him with). Senpai is depressed as fuck i mean holy shit. Class Rep is uhh idefk scammed shitless. But all these tragedies and personalities shows the reality of the world an how a person with a mental disorder taht apparently talks to fridges handle their situation. In the end, you can't survive on your own. Like the saying goes, 'No man is an Island'.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\n------\\n\r\nThe anime's story and art really boosted the overall score. I mean if we had these characters with a fucked up shitty story I'd probably give it a damn 6 or 5. Anime seems dull and unpromising in the start but in the end it is not quite bad. Let the start be bad but the end shall be glorius.\\n\\n\\n",

This anime goes through many phases, greeting each character and their backgrounds, giving clearer understandings of the MC and the other reoccurring characters. The feeling you get after you finish this series is very satisfying. This is the first time I have watched an anime where the developer gives you those \"what if\" scenes and it really messes with you. Sometimes I wished that some parts of the story were just those scenes, becauseof the shock it leaves me in. This anime is very close to realistic, in reference to the story and how things unfold. You'll see as you watch that they take you through many numerous real-life situations and throw them all in this anime where it just fits in so perfectly. Health problems and issues are inferred and give a sense of instability that makes you empathize easily with the characters. The problems they face become more horrific and reasons for their behaviors are understood. This is such a great anime that its hard to put it into words fully. I'm just going to say, watch it for yourself and you'll come to understand why others rate it so highly.",

Welcome to the NHK isn't your generic little sword wielding, fanservice-y boob flailing, titan attacking, overhyped nonsense type of anime, no it's a show that pokes fun at what happens when fans of said shows go running rampant around outside. Actually no they don't go outside at all, you figure they're probably inside playing MMORPGS, watching hentai or doing other taboo things that makes them, to the world, that guy that lives in their mom's basement. But how do you think said person REALLY feels? What drove them to said life in the first place? Well, Welcome tothe NHK begs and tries it's best to answer said questions with a resounding yet simple message: Sometimes the world just is mean like that sometimes. It's realistic but ridiculous, tragic but funny, and just about as close as you can get to a Chuck Palahniuk novel with an anime.This show; revolving around an unemployed college dropout named Sato, confronts every possible situation that the most lonely, lazy and or susceptible people get into. NHK tackles some really interesting issues through Sato, who is a lazy, likeable, and borderline-emotionally disturbed character who gets easily sucked into pyramid schemes, porn, suicide pacts, and making gal games in order to find his place in the world. The show does a really good job with its cast of characters in showing what can happen when people are pushed to their limits of loneliness and desperation, and despite the fact that it's also a very funny psychological slice of life show, it was very depressing and the ending got me pretty choked up. NHK did a great job at hitting home for people who have felt sad or lonely, and it features a great cast of characters who are just plain sick of society, pushed into a corner and looking for someone to blame. I was really impressed with this show, its funny, dramatic, and the outlook it has is so amazingly bleak that I couldn't help but love it even more. The main issue that I had with the show though was the fact that sometimes the situations were a little too stretched, and I found it hard to believe that situations like clever Sato and Yamazaki getting sucked into the same pyramid scheme twice. But Welcome to the NHK remains one of my favorites thanks to it's bleak message, great characters, and hilarious situations.\\n\\n\r\n\"I GET IT SUCK ME DRY\"",

            "content": "Sad, paranoid, but ultimately optimistic at its core, Welcome to the N.H.K. is a relatively thoughtful depiction of Japanese subcultures and social problems. Each member of the main cast is used to explore topical subjects e.g. hikikomori, otaku, multi-level marketing scams, and suicide. It's unclear how well this will age, but as things stand it's a very fine anime and altogether quite sobering despite nominally being a comedy. The more objectionable content from the manga is toned down; notably, Sato only becomes addicted to pornography rather than literally filling up his hard drive with loli, and his drug addiction is removed. It doesn't hurt theanime drastically, but it does inevitably reduce the degree to which you can perceive him as dysfunctional. This also affects Hitomi, the girl responsible for his drug problems, who comes across as merely unfortunate rather than actively hurtful to anyone. It detracts somewhat from the rawness of the show, but it's still very convincing as a drama when it wants to be.\\n\\n\r\nAs noted, classifying Welcome to the N.H.K. as a comedy sells it short. The best parts of Welcome to the N.H.K. are not comedic. In fact, the comedy in Welcome to the N.H.K. is inconsistent and descends far too often into the unfortunate \"EHHHHHH? WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHOUTING ALL MY LINES DOESN'T MAKE THIS FUNNY SATO-SAN?\" brand of humor, particularly when the otaku character, Yamazaki, is onscreen. Usually, though, the comedy is merely decent\u2014nothing offensively bad, and the distinctive characters keep the gags from becoming too bland.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, it is those characters who make this show so very good. They're social pariahs\u2014dysfunctional and often unpleasant. Sato is lonely, lazy, and horny, Yamazaki is less lazy but much hornier, Misaki is self-loathing, attention-seeking, and manipulative, and Hitomi is self-involved and depressed. It's nonetheless easy to like and relate all of them and cheer them on as they work through their troubles. These are people who don't\u2014can't\u2014fit in with what we call \"normal\" and find themselves very easily lost in the world. It's not surprising that they lose hope and begin to see conspiracies hidden behind everyday things\u2014the forces of a society that they don't understand lining up against them.\\n\\n\r\nWelcome to the N.H.K.'s production is simply okay\u2014average music, average art and animation, etc. Frankly, it's indistinct, and the fact that it's so easy to overlook the unexceptional nature of the show's technical quality only serves to emphasize how good the dramatic aspects of this show are. The most impressive visual elements crop up whenever Sato begins to contemplate his N.H.K. conspiracy\u2014the show drifts off into these dreamy, abstract sequences that complement its occasionally hopeless tone.\\n\\n\r\nIt's probably not a good idea to watch Welcome to the N.H.K. if you want a light-hearted comedy romp. The show demands investment in the characters' psychological development. Despite its thoroughly Japanese subjects, it doesn't require any interest in Japanese society and its concerns about a lost generation; these issues are treated in such a way that they become more broadly human. To put it like Misaki: if you watch this and you can't relate, the penalty is one million yen!",

            "content": "Apparently, when originally airing on television, Welcome to the NHK was  shown in the earliest hours of morning, the idea being that the only people awake at this time would be real hikikomori, a mostly Japanese phenomenon where usually unemployed men never leave their house, typically surviving on food brought to their door by their parents, or by once in a rare while going out to get their essentials with unemployment money. The main character of Welcome to the NHK is one of these, or at least for the first half of the first episode or so. Locked up in his room he experienceshallucinations about NHK, Japanese state television, brainwashing its population into becoming hikikomori, the theory inspired by the ideas of a mentally ill, older girl he spent his high school days with, playing cards together, never becoming romantically involved despite obvious tension between them.\\n\\n\r\nShortly, things start to change when he accidentally opens the door for a cute girl who decides to help the main character become normal through the way of bizarre lectures in the park outside his apartment building. Soon he also discovers the irritating music coming from the neighboring apartment is being played by someone the main character in high school tried to rescue from bullying to impress his deranged upperclassman girl. Soon the three are roaming the outsides, even running into the girl from high school, everything from suicide pacts to pyramid schemes being explored. As the show goes on, the conspiracy theories come to represent the bad sides of life we must all find some way to bear with. Conspiracies are everywhere, is my interpretation, and help lies in making your own conspiracies with people you can trust against the conspiracies that would otherwise harm you. Friends are a good thing, basically.\\n\\n\r\nIn this sense, MyAnimeList is such a conspiracy. People tell each other about animes, warning each other about the bad ones, recommending good ones. For this reason, I wish to spend the rest of this review warning you of the core conspiracy of Welcome to the NHK instead of for example telling you about the generally fine animation, if one can overlook the occasional drops in quality in certain episode, or acceptable audio. This is the conspiracy: For most of the time the show treats the concerns of lost, young people satirically. Even the set-up of the show, with a girl whose only problems are adorable (the manic pixie dream girl) going out of her way to rescue the introverted, lonely main character, is a play on the same kind of stories the show makes fun of, even by having the main characters try to make a computer game with such unrealistic romances.\\n\\n\r\nBy making fun of these things, and referencing the difficulties of the real world, the show makes you feel like it's better, more realistic and somehow different from such media. The big conspiracy being that when it all wraps up in the end, you don't even notice that is has played the exact same tricks on you that such stories do: It has let you escape to a world where things are much better than they actually are in the real world for a moment. I mean, at the end of the day, it's still the story about a young, lonely man being pursued by a dream girl. The big question then is whether you believe a good anime achieves some mystical, essential quality when it manages not to make any mistakes, or whether you're able to enjoy a good trick of cards played on you. I'm a cynic, personally. I loved Welcome to the NHK and my only related sorrow is that I'm out of episodes.",

            "content": "In a medium saturated with inane high school slice-of-life comedies, Welcome to the NHK is a rare gem. The show gives a heartfelt and heart-wrenching account of the life of Satou Tatsuhiro, a 22 year old NEET who lives in an apartment in Tokyo by himself. His life of sleeping all day and hallucinating about talking household appliances is turned upside down when Misaka Nakahara, a mysterious high school girl, meets him by chance and resolves to save him from his hikkikomori ways. \r\nWelcome to the NHK is not just about Satou, but also larger problems faced by young people in Japan. The show explorespyramid schemes, suicide pacts, and real money trading in games by putting Satou through those situations. Each of these mini-arcs really develops Satou\u2019s character and teaches him how to go on with his life. However, Satou can be pretty dense. Very often he immediately forgets the lessons he learned in one scheme and gets himself caught up in another one. I understand that the author did this to explore more subcultures, but from a storytelling perspective it was a bit unrealistic for Satou to revert to his old self so easily.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, there is definitely character development in the show. Satou and Misaki have an unconventional yet sweet relationship, which I loved watching. Some of the other characters, especially Satou\u2019s high school kouhai and neighbor, Yamazaki, also grew a lot as the series progressed. I won\u2019t give any spoilers, but there are tons of tender moments between the different characters. I am not ashamed to admit that the show moved me to tears more than once, especially towards the end when Satou discovers why Misaki was helping him.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for something serious, moving, and real look no further than Welcome to the NHK. If you\u2019re looking for something lighthearted or easy-to-watch avoid this anime at all costs.  \\n",

Story is really great,the way the characters behave to each other at first you would say \"well this is something common,regural nothing new\" but then later you would be like\r\n\" no way, ok,what is happening right now,it cant be,why\". 22 years old guy trapped into his world,the only world in which he can live as hewishes,the only world in which he can be free,the only world he in which he cant feel anxiety etc. you know the guy is hikikomori for few years and then suddenly some people just pop into his life and try to change it in some way. I am doing my best not to spoil so I will stop right here.\\n\r\nThe thing I really like here is that all of very different emotions are mixing together in one big pot and when it comes to its near end it just spills out leaving the trail of pure love,friendship,relations and most of them all : real life.\\n\r\nI really recommend this anime to all of you,its worth watching believe me :)\\n\\n\r\nPs.this is my first review since I became member of this community like one week ago or so ^^\\n\r\nthanks for reading\\n\r\nEnjoy ^-^",

Will try to aim for no spoilers.\r\nWell as usual I jump into this anime thinking it will be like something else but then ends up being completely different, and I was not dissappointed. In fact, it was one of those rare animes I became massively invested in, hoping to see the characters be sucessful in their goals, and even when their major goal is not met they seem to end up happy withthe life they have. The story can really hit hard depending on who you are. I really sympathised a lot with Sato since I have issues like him to an extent (not hikkomori bad but sometimes being around people is stressful). The series itself really displays how relationships and life itself isn't all that easy to understand or simple. Habits that people have are also not so easy to break either, but sometimes it's possible with just the right push. I really recommend this anime to anyone really, espically people who feel confused or lost regarding their life. It really made me think about things too. The one minor thing that bugged me was with one of the episodes, It was animated so differently compared to the rest of the series and it stuck out to me like a sore thumb. I don't know if the animator had an off day or they had another company do it but well, it wasn't bad, but it just wasn't consistant, hence, the art gets a 6.",

            "content": "The Japanese always seem to have words for things we wish there was an English equivalent to. For example, the Japanese word Bakku-shan is one you would use when you see a woman from behind and go \u201cdamnn gurrll!\u201d until she turns around and you\u2019re like \u201coh\u2026nevermind.\u201d Awkward.\r\nA hikikomori is one of these words. It literally translates to \u201cpulling inward\u201d, but it is used to describe those members of society who choose to withdraw from it; they are reclusive to the extreme due to whatever internal personal conflict or fear  left to grow unchecked inside of them.\r\nThis evil organization the N.H.K. create hikikamori forthe purpose of making the normal yet still average members of society feel better about themselves by giving them someone lower than themselves to look down upon. Pushed to the lowest of the low, these lonely recluses find themselves at the end of the food chain, like those fish that suck the bottoms and sides of the tank by themselves. The majority of the N.H.K.\u2019s work is done via the media and anime, causing helpless innocents to spiral into hardcore otaku and other pathetic derivatives of human beings. There are several agents that carry out their work\u2014M.I.B. type men, celebrities, or even blue haired moe cat girls.\\n\\n\r\nSato is useless, self-destructive, and completely caught up inside is own head. He dives head first into absurd situations without any thought of consequences, he\u2019s unreliable and lacks motivation, he\u2019s not particularly good at anything, and only causes trouble for himself and everybody else around him\u2014including his lonely otaku neighbor, Yamazaki who Sato suspects has fallen into the conspiracy\u2019s trap, and his ex, Hitomi, who also believes her whole life is run by men in black hiding in the shadows. More importantly, on the chance day he decides to open his door, he meets a strange high school girl, Misaki Nakahara. She shows up claiming she\u2019s going to \u2018fix\u2019 him\u2014but it turns out she might need him as much as he needs her.\\n\\n\r\nI liked both the animation and the music for this show ((the intro is the most forgettable song I\u2019ve heard in an anime, but the 1st ending is amazing\u2014the images and the lyrics fit these misanthropes to a tee)). The animation can get lazy in parts, but for a slice of life anime, there was a lot more love and effort put into the realistic often gritty looking backgrounds and more important \u2018action\u2019 or emotional sequences.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is definitely not for everybody. There\u2019s a lot of dark and crude humor (what do you think 20-something year old guys do in their apartments all day?), but I never found it to be inappropriate or too much. Given my limited introduction to anime in the 90\u2019s ((which was mostly shounen fighting fanfare)), I forget where Japan draws all of their humor from. Nearly all of the series I\u2019ve watched since my revival slip in fanservice in in some form\u2014even the series as innocent looking as Chobits. Where I find it works best is when it makes sense in context, and is not too raunchy. Throwing a pair of high school girls into the shower doesn\u2019t do it for me, but a hormonally driven adolescent accidentally (or not) fantasizing about every girl he knows works when it serves to give insight into his character and the development of their relationship and not just for the sake of creating a spineless, perverted weenie meant to represent the \u2018every man\u2019. \\n\\n\r\nIt also helps when the erotic fantasy is slipped right next to a scene where the protagonist is also fantasizing about talking chibi floating flan desserts multiplying like amoebas.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Welcome to the N.H.K. stand out from other slice of life anime, is that the focus is on these four obscure, unhappy people and their place (or rather lack of place) in society. The relationships are natural and intriguing\u2014but they make us uncomfortable. Sato does nothing with his life\u2014he offers nothing, and in turn, society has no reason to accept him. Any attempt he makes at breaking from his unhappy cycle is ultimately foiled by the defects in his own character\u2014laziness, immaturity, pure insanity\u2026 We also know this isn\u2019t going to work when the attempts to break out involve trying to make money on an MMORPG or trying to escape reality by vacationing on a deserted island.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s nice is that the show neither condones nor condemns our characters for their lifestyle. The show doesn\u2019t judge Sato for sitting in his apartment and playing hentai games all night; we just get to watch him do it and see what happens ((oh dear\u2026)).\\n\\n\r\nSo why watch this show at all? There\u2019s interesting social commentary in here about being unemployed and sponging off your parents, having unconventional interests, a bit about the suicide issues in Japan, and what people are capable of when they\u2019re pushed to their limits.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I\u2019m trying to get at, is that Welcome to the N.H.K. feels very real. Sato is not a bishie with navy hair and a charming smile\u2014he\u2019s average. He\u2019s actually below average. All of the character designs, while not uninspired, are muted to reflect real, palatable people. It allows for their unique unhappy personalities, not their rainbow hair, to carry them through the series. \\n\\n\r\nSo Sato should be unlikable, Yamazaki is creepy, and Hitomi is miserable, and yet there\u2019s something about these characters that can find some chord to strike in everyone. Who hasn\u2019t wanted to stay in their house all day instead of having of having to go outside? Who\u2019s never felt once as if the entire world were collapsing around them; or as if they didn\u2019t fit in? The characters drag us into empathizing with them whether we like it or not; they\u2019re endearing because the desire to act and change is there, but motivation or bravery isn\u2019t. I challenge anyone to tell me they\u2019ve never felt that way.\\n\\n\r\nBecause sometimes these issues hit a little too close to home, Welcome to the N.H.K. is uncomfortable and refreshing for it. It\u2019s also inspiring for it. There\u2019s no idyllic happy ending for any of the characters, but it\u2019s not unsatisfying either\u2014it\u2019s life.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had a nit to pick with the series, it would have to be with the romance. The relationship between Sato and Misaki starts off quirky and develops pretty nicely for a while and at a good pace. And then somewhere in the middle, it kind of halts. We get moments of feelings that pass between the two, but it\u2019s often one sided and put aside for the other issues and themes the show wants to explore. However, the ending and resolution between these two is so good you can\u2019t even be mad about it.",

            "content": "It baffles me that this anime is so tragically underrated. There are anime considered \"deep\" and \"life changing\" that take cheap, supernatural, \"deus ex machina\" approaches to resolve all their problems, stealing away the realistic elements they tried so hard to convey. We're just not allowed to say that, because we would be considered heartless assholes for pointing out this truth. Nonetheless, this point still stands, whether you like these various series or not.\r\n\"Welcome to the NHK\" does not do that. Through the mishaps of a bizarre and interesting cast, it keeps it real. Despite the sarcastic, dark, off the wall humor, it still keepsthings real.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're reading this review, you probably have some sense of the basic plot already. The story focusses on Sato Tatsuhiro, a college, drop out and a recluse, also known as a hikikomori, and the various people he encounters through his journey: Misaki Nakahara, a mysterious girl, claiming to possess the cure for his illness, Kaoru Yamazaki, an otaku with the dream of become a famous game designer, Hitomi Kashiwa, Sato's senpai now a public servant, and so on. Their lives ultimately weave together to create an amazing tapestry of comprehensive insanity. Despite their unique struggles, the one thread that ties these misfits together is this: the sheer fact alone that they DO suffer. That's what makes the anime so beautiful. Everyone has really felt something one of these characters go through, be it sadness, fear, anxiety, hopelessness, neglect, and so on. All the same, their disorders and problems don't define their character. They are still are unique, well developed, stand alone characters. The story does an fantastic job combining comedy and drama. One episode, you're laughing. The next, you're sobbing. But, it does so tastefully. The ending was what impressed me the most. Without giving too much away, there's no magical resolution to everyone's problems. While they are still hopeful, they hold true to how a situation might go. It's believable. It's relatable. It's real.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime truly is life changing. I have talked to several people who have talked about watching this during a very difficult time in their life and how it helped them pull through them.\\n\\n\r\nI am one of those people.\\n\\n\r\nThat truly is the power of a masterpiece.",

            "content": "When it comes to turning the life of a hikikomori into an interesting adventure of them trying to over come their social issues, this anime does relatively well. However due to relatively stale premise of the anime, it received the score of 6.\r\nThe start (1-8) I would consider a grind, introducing characters in a very typical manner. It becomes very easy to predict the roles of the characters later on, something that I do not personally enjoy.\r\nThe mid-section (9-16) is when you start to see the characters fit in their role as expected. They do it well. but as expected. Up to this point notmuch character development that would save this from the typical romance.\\n\\n\r\nThe end of this anime is what I think saves this anime. You find out details about the characters which would actually influence the way they behave, and subjects you to the trauma undergone by these characters, the scary part being how real it could all be.\\n\\n\r\nThe final two episodes are highly memorable, and open your eyes as to a very real issue in the world. Anime is often criticised for being unrealistic in both the approach and execution of real world issues, and as the characters are animated become hard to relate to. However this anime goes against this, with both relatable characters and a real world setting, it is easy to see how this could actually be happening right now.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, an anime I enjoyed, and that you should watch if you can watch a slow and boring grind for a great pay off. And no, don't skip the first few episodes, as you do need to at least know some of the characters and how they interact.",

Sato's journey makes  for a harsh and interesting story, that strongly accentuates on compulsive behavior and the importance of human relations.\\n\\n\r\nLeaving the viewer always wondering if Sato will be able leave is hikikomori ways and reclaim is normal life, is one of the shows best premises, and one that kept me glued to the story. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\n-One of the good things about the characters is that, each and everyone of them is damaged, with their own set of flaws and obsessions, that contrast greatly with Sato. From extreme otaku's, to stalkers or people obsessed with conspiracy theory's. This show really explores all kinds of different personalities, and people that for some reason feel alienated from society.\\n\r\n Although sometimes they can be annoying, most of the characters feel unique and are all well designed\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nOn the sound department, every VA does a good job, and as always some voices may  be hard to tolerate depending on your taste, i personally had no problem with the VA's on this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOn the soundtrack side of things, while not being memorable , the music in this show does complement the scenes in a good way,  portraying the unique feeling of the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nArt is by far the weakest aspect of this anime, while in most of the scenes the art and animation are good, using simple but effective drawings on the characters and detailed backgrounds. In some episodes the quality of the art and animation simply plummets into ridiculous levels , leaving you wondering if  they ran out money in the middle of production or had a ridiculous tight schedule.\\n\r\nWith that said, its a shame because it can be immersion breaking and its  its the only major flaw, in what is a great anime.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\\n\r\nI had a great time with this show, at first i was surprised simply because i was expecting something more similar to Genshiken which I'm a fan, and got a completely different take on otaku and in this case hikikomori life. The story, the characters all felt unique and different from everything  else i have experienced in anime, which along with the art and the music made for a good experience. Too bad the art and animation inconsistency in some episodes somewhat crippled my experience as a whole, but overall i still had a great time\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

            "content": "Welcome to the NHK is a drama/comedy that features very serious issues like social anxiety, suicidal thoughts and psychological breakdowns and deals with them with a mix of drama and comedy. \"The NHK\" is pretty much a byproduct of thoughts of the protagonist and is not featured that much in the series. \r\nSTORY\r\n Satou hasn't been outside of his home for years and lives of his mothers money. He meets a girl named Misaki who wants to help him get out of his shell through counseling, which Satou eventually takes part in. \r\nThe real fun starts once Satou meets his neighbor Yamazaki, who's an completeotaku and becomes Satou's friend. The interaction between the two becomes the basis of great comedy, as two socially awkward persons reflect on life and try to become a succesful person.\\n\r\nThe balance of comedy and drama is very well done. The comedy never comes in the way of the drama and the drama is reflected trough comedy in a way we can grasp the reality. Comedy helps us to deal with though issues, and Welcome to the NHK does this job very well. \\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nI personally like the artstyle. The art fits the settings i.e. psychological (comedic) outbursts feature crazy stuff like explosions and talking furniture. Satou's home mostly feels depressing and dark while the center of tokyo makes you feel paranoid (like our main character) with dark colors and large amounts of 'anonymous looking' people walking in a fast pace. In a sense of tension the animation is well done. The disign more of a taste-issue\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nNot much too say about the music. It's good and it's mostly used on relevant parts of the series. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nThe show features three main characters. Satou (protagonist), Yamazaki (neighbor/friend/otaku) and Misaki (girl/sort of love interest). Because of that there is lot of room for character development. You'll follow Satou, who tries to deal with social anxiety and who is also a very funny character. He is very naieve and gets himself cought up in stupid situations because of that. i.e. he gets thrown into a multilevel marketing system though he knew upfront it was a scam. In a way he reminds me of Randy from South park, who's very easy to get ethousiastic about 'the new thing' and doesn't even notice he's totally wrapped up into it. \\n\\n\r\n The mysterious Misaki is a lesser interesting person, mainly because you won't get to know much about her most of the series. She has serious mental issues aswell but you won't get to know much about it until later on the series. I won't spoil it. \\n\\n\r\nYamazaki, Satou's neighbor, is a complete otaku with his room full of anime figurines, posters and eroge. He is, just like Satou a social outcast, except he goes to school and dreams of being a gamedesigner. Yamazaki becomes friends with Satou and the two toghether is always a guarantee for hilarious comedy. A lot of otaku-related humor i.e. the two of them creating a anti-women allience, only for Yamazaki to leave as soon as a girl asks him for a date.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\r\nThe show features one of the greatest comedy I've seen, but almost had me in tears in the dramatic parts. A series that makes you feel very sad at one point and makes you laugh your ass of at other points is a good thing. Also pretty addicting. Watched the first 10 episodes in one run. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nI was about to give this show a 9, but downgraded it to an 8 because of the last few episodes feel very rushed and are overdramatic. The show features social issues that are present in every culture, set in Tokyo. I think a lot of you can relate to them, wether you've ever suffered depression or not. Definately recommend 'Welcome to the NHK.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Welcome to the NHK is an unconventional slice of life drama that deals with hikikumori lifestyle. A hikikumori is a person who fails at socialization and therefore confines himself in his room/home. This anime follows a hikikumori named Satou while he strives to get out of this adverse lifestyle.\r\nIn the beginning of the pilot episode, we see Satou remembering the small incidents that took place before he became a hikikumori and could probably lead to his failure to socialize, while also living his usual life. NHK creates a fitting environment of a hikikumori's room with emphasis on details. The disastrous condition of his room andhis appearance reflects his shabby lifestyle. His physical and psychological state is presented through silly behaviors and unorthodox imagination. Thus, this anime fleshes out Satou's characteristics and a hikikumori state simultaneously. This anime actually goes deep into the root of this problem, showing us exactly why it happens and how hard it is to be free of this problematic lifestyle through Satou's continuous failures. It also provides the proper solution to it by comparing many different solutions the characters try out. From the core to the solution, this anime explores the hikikumori problem deeply and views it from many angles.\\n\r\nWhile the hikikumori lifestyle is emphasized on the most, Welcome to the NHK beholds almost every possible scenarios an unfortunate individual may face as well. It also works on other Japanese subcultures like NEET lifestyle, otaku attitude, lolicon, Internet suicide pacts, etc.\\n\r\nIt even emphasizes on the smallest of points of daily life. The anime also deals with psychological subjects like inferiority complex, suicidal tendency, borderline personality disorder, etc. The subtext of having someone or something to pass some blames to and believing in God's existence are two other daring and interesting themes this anime works with.\\n\r\nThe story of this anime is repetitive at how Satou gets himself entangled into problems in every arc. But, the variations of these issues and the different incidents taking place in each arc make it somewhat unpredictable and interesting. Despite the similar formula, all the arcs actually stand out. Seeing how thorough this anime uses the adversaries and their solutions to present the story, one is convinced to think that it's written after much research. The pacing in each story arc is decent as the plot of the arc progresses quite well in every episode. But, the overall progression is slow because after the end of each arc, there are very little change in the plot. And the anime doesn't really use it as a plus point unlike Tatami, so it comes off as a drawback. The transition between each arc is well handled. The keys to the climax in every arc come from the incidents before it. So, there is no inconsistency of the flow in between the arcs. It keeps getting better till the end. The story in a nutshell isn't particularly something magnificent, but very good nevertheless. The side stories are pretty good and very touching at times. The ending isn't anything slice of life clich\u00e9 or typical. It is in fact quite unpredictable in a realistic manner.\\n\r\nThere's isn't much of a narration done in this anime and it's better this way as this is an anime where the characters' actions run the story. The MC acts as an unreliable narrator. This results in a proper exposure of his thoughts. His behavior is justified from a psychological point of view. He is a well-explored character and a \"perfect window for the viewer\" protagonist. In each arc, he develops little by little through different experiences. The development is slow and realistic. By the end of the series, he becomes a man a lot different from the beginning while also having his key traits present.\\n\r\nThe realistic problems that the characters face make them very relatable. One cannot but empathize to their sufferings. They develop considerably while trying to solve or live through these problems. The characters aren't pawns to the plot and can contradict it when it's adverse for them. They create a dimension of their own. Here the characters actually try and developed themselves.\\n\r\nWhat helps the characters to be more realistic is the character design. The production team designed the characters differently without adding unrealistic visual traits. The body proportion is done right. There is no large eyes and the noses are visible. The illustration of the characters however is sometimes inconsistent and therefore the anime has derp faces every once in a while. The color palette in this anime is also realistic. It's not vibrant nor is it dark. The color tone is the same for both the characters and the environment. As a result, they harmonize very well. The choice of colors is great and nothing out of place or excessively eye catching, just how it should be. The background is detailed. The animation is usually decent, but has small problems like static jaws when talking, or unmoving camera, etc. Aside from these small, and sometimes not so obvious shortcomings, the choreography is done well with plausible movements of the characters. And the cinematography is also decent with well calculated view from different angles, well measured gradiants and proper lighting & shading. Overall, the visual department isn't extravagant and does what's necessary to assist the anime.\\n\r\nThe opening song of this anime has some of the most visually compelling animation job with free flowing motion, well choreographed movements, squeeze and squash effects :^) , indicative art style, juicy colors, which are coherent to the rhythm of the catchy and enjoyable song \"Puzzle\". The symphony is well played. The ending is something extraordinary, with overwhelming piano playing in the first few seconds and some compelling scenes; and then an interesting song of absurdity. The background musics in this anime are fitting and impressive. The voice acting at first was slightly out of place, but got better soon enough. I had no problem with it. The sound and screenplay are cohesive. The production value of this anime is great.\\n\r\nWelcome to the NHK is a dark comedy with significant amount of realism. Entertainment is a very subjective matter. Personally, I really enjoyed its comedic aspects a lot although it didn't exactly hit the nail as I'm not really much into comedy. Some jokes managed to really crack me up real good and I laughed harder than I should have. It has its fair share of seriousness which is also quite entertaining. It had enticing moments, moments of suspense. It's a very enjoyable anime overall.\\n\r\nThis anime does its job very well. It's a purely psychological anime with slice of life aspects which is quite a dareful challenge of itself, but the anime executes it well. It's an excellent anime worth 9/10 in my opinion.",

            "content": "Welcome to the NHK is a black comedy/ drama focused on our male lead Tatsuhiro Satou, a 23-year old college dropout who has isolated himself from the public at large living life as a hikikomori. He runs into a mysterious teenage girl named Misaki Nakahara who claims that she can cure him of his hikikomori ways and this kickstarts Satou's time with Misaki and several others he knew from his high school days that have their own varying personal problems that he winds up becoming entangled in.\r\nOutside of this being one of Gonzo's more better works quality wise, Welcome to the NHK is rather refreshingin its exploration of living life as a hikikomori through the eyes of Satou. While many anime titles nowadays tend to glorify living life as a NEET or hikikomori with their lead characters, NHK depicts that lifestyle through a more realistic lens as Satou is depicted as a mentally unstable and impulsive man-child with a deep fear for interacting with the outside world. He has his vices that he will give into such as online gaming, eroge games and downloading pornography to ease his boredom while isolated within his apartment. In addition, he gives into delusions of conspiracy to try blaming society at large for the problems he has with interacting with the outside world. His interactions with Misaki and others throughout the series lead him to gradually get over his social anxieties and come to grips with what he wishes to get out of life, while becoming entangled with the personal problems that each character brings along with them.\\n\\n\r\nShowing just how pathetic Satou's character is makes up much of the black comedy to the series. The delusions that he has regarding his conspiracies and whatever thoughts he has of certain characters are both funny and sad. They are funny as said thoughts are rather over-the-top and get rather absurd, such as when Satou talks with talking electric appliances to go along with his delusions of a conspiracy leading him to be a hikikomori. At the same time, they are also rather sad as they believably depict just how low the man has gone with resorting to vices and delusions to escape from the hardships of everyday living.\\n\\n\r\nThe mentioned supporting characters in Satou's everyday life also get their fleshing out as we come to learn more of the personal problems each face. Issues such as child abuse, suicide and pyramid schemes are brought up in exploring the ordeals faced by Misaki and Satou's old classmates as hints are dropped of each character having more going on with them than what it would seem on the surface and arcs of the series are devoted to exploring their personal issues. The fact that NHK can explore touchy social issues in a realistic fashion while maintaining a decent balance of black comedy and drama makes it a unique title that sticks out rather prominently.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, Welcome to the NHK is a bit on the average end for a 2006 title. For the most part, scenery and character designs have a decent amount of detail and shading applied to them with believable details to go along with the show's realistic focus. Characters move about in a fluid pace with no sign of noticeable shortcuts, though the animation is nowhere on par with high quality titles like Black Lagoon and Death Note made in that year. The animation does occasionally degrade in quality at points during the series with characters being off-model and movement looking a bit jerky during some animated sequences, this being quite noticeable during points in the show's nineteenth episode.\\n\\n\r\nHaving seen this years later, Welcome to the NHK sticks out quite a bit for an anime focused on a NEET/ hikikomori character. The series doesn't glorify the lifestyle as others of its ilk tend to do nowadays and offers a realistic and believable focus on the ordeals faced by such a person in the form of Satou. It also offers a good deal of focus on Misaki and other characters that the man interacts with as they also have their own personal issues that have to be addressed. If you are looking for a series that is strong on character exploration and offers a believable look in the hikikomori lifestyle, Welcome to the NHK is a strong title I would recommend you try out.",

Satou, the main protagonist is a college dropout and unemployed, barely surviving on his parents' monthly allowance. His condition as a hikikomori is the main theme of the anime; a person who avoids social contact. While the anime focuses on keeping the show entertaining with funny dialogues, they also focus the dark side of being an otaku/hikikomori/NEET: depression, suicide, social anxiety, etc. The plot follows if Sato is able to come out from hishikikomori condition and how he achieves it. I\u2019d recommend this to anyone who wants to watch something entertaining whilst also gaining insight from every character\u2019s experience.",

            "content": "Welcome to the NHK is in my opinion one of the best black comedies of all the time and here my reasons.\r\nStory\r\nThis show is more than \"the story of a archetipical hikikomoro\" In a few words this show is a realistic representation of some common subcultures (if we can call it like that) in Japan, otaku, neet (people without employment) and hikikomori (people who are afraid to get outside his \"safe space\", mostly his house or his room. This makes the story touch some common psychological and social issues like depression, escapism, etc. in a very mature and serious way with comedy and some socialcommentary but not in a so direct way.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe strongest point of the series, his characters are way more than the archetypes of this subcultures (hikikomori, otaku as examples). The story represent this characters in a very human way, they aren't just stereotypes you can laugh to, they are represented as real people with real life problems many of us had, the fear of failure, the pressure of dealing with the family, the lost of someone we love and the feeling of being useless in society. Each character's deal with different but similar problems, explain the characters and all their dimensions is so difficult so it can be write in this review, so this explanation above is better than categorizing them in stereotypes like \" otaku\".\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe designs are simple but go well with the type of show (pseudo- slice of life comedy) so are OK, but the weakest point of the series is the animation, it can be awful sometimes, the movement can look sometimes as cardboard just as the drawings sometimes, this is most noticeable in two episodes, the fourth and one near the end, but the movement isn't as important because of the type of series, sometimes the characters just move the mouth walk or make other simple corporal gestures and really it only looks horrible in two episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound is good, as well as the voice acting The opening really doesn't go with the series it is very light toned, but the ending, it is pure madness and paranoia, it has the same tone of the series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nAs I said it has many psychological themes in it and touch them in a very excellent and realistic way, the black humour is also great and an important part of the story, if you enjoy this type of humour as well as excellent and realistic characters and mature psychological themes I recommended to you.\\n\\n\r\nOverral\\n\r\nA great dark comedy portraying a more realistic and farmers side of the otaku culture, with characters who really feel like humans instead of caricatures, with many beautiful messages like the anti-escapism, and to defeat the great fear of failure as well as a beautiful conclusion. It may be very depressing in the middle and towards the end of the story, but at the last moment is a very optimistic and beautiful piece of work. My personal third favorite anime.",

But as the episode progresses, this anime feels more meaningful and engaging in feeling social issues daily in-depth, And full of life\u2019s struggle. Topics such as otaku (Japanese term for a big fan of anime and comic), hikikomori, NEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training aka POLICY) pornography, online games, MMORPG, nomads life, internet, nostalgia, romance to MLM (Multi-Level Marketing) as if to invite us to laugh at ourselves.

(My review doesn't have any specific spoilers, just general plot info, and opinion)\r\nCertain parts of the anime are unrealistic, and scenes can seem forced at times, but I think the focus of this anime is not to create completely believable characters or a flawless story, but rather to get a message across- and I think they succeeded in their goal.  \r\nIt's essentially about a guy(the main character) who has avoided reality for the longest time because it was toopainful to face, and his journey back into the real world.\\n\\n\r\nHe tries a bunch of different things, thinking every time, this will be it! The end of my Hikikomori (which is pretty much the state of being a shut in who doesn't work or attend school or anything, I'm not sure of the difference between this and a NEET though).  He goes through many trials and journeys with himself and others, gives up sometimes, finds joyful moments, makes progress, relapses, turns to a variety of vices, and ultimately finds that there is no easy solution.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike most anime, which serve as escapes from reality, this show confronts life in all of its painful contradictions and unfairness, while still maintaining a hopeful tone that is especially heard towards the end. I would recommend the show to anybody who wants to watch an anime a little different from the rest.",

            "content": "This is quite old, only available in 420p, but it is still one of best anime I have ever watched. The plot twists, the depth of the characters, how it feels like there isn't a care in the world and then suddenly something happens, how well they put the story together and make the anime dramatic, depressing, romantic and yet still funny at times. Even caused some tears in some scenes. \r\nIt really digs deep into real-world stuff, dark stuff like drug abuse, bad relationships, ect, but this isn't a bad thing, it deepens the plot hugely and made me attracted to the anime muchmore. The OP is extremely good, satisfying to the ears and fits in with the anime, not even fits in actually, it makes waiting for the actual content to start a pleasure, this is one of the OP's that you simply just don't skip.\\n\\n\r\n Overall a 10/10 from me, a masterpiece maybe? Anime like this make me really appreciate the people working on it from behind-the-scenes. I put effort into writing this because this anime honestly deserves it, I hope more anime like this come out soon, this is definitely my favourite anime. Thanks for reading.",

As I started to watch Welcome To The NHK, I noticed just how much I really could relate to the main character Sato and his struggles of being a NEET. You might think that the character is somewhat of a pussy when it comes to romance, but if you put yourself in the main character's shoes, this is the most real feeling romance anime I haveever seen to date. The emotional roller coaster this anime puts you through is honestly quite exhausting. This is emphasized by the beginning of the anime leaning towards comedy but the deeper you go, the more bittersweet moments will appear before you. Even though it is clear from the first few episodes who the main heroine is, there is still a sense of disconnect through Sato and her. You never really know what will come out of their relationship and the slow development of it makes you want it to happen that much more.",

The rep class's hikikomori could have had an interesting role in this story, but he was discarded too soon. One of the things Sato could have done is psychological counseling for lonely people or for other hikikomori. Also, at theend, I expected to see at least a kiss between the two main characters, but I guess that would be too much to ask for from a producer, who does not understand that the love, at first sight, ends well and even with a wedding.\\n\\n\r\n Would I ever rewatch this anime?

            "content": "Alright Studio Gonzo what now? This is a studio that can hurt anime fans with mediocre to just plain bad anime adaptations such as Gantz to Speed Grapher. Yuusuke Yamamoto was the guy given the role of director even through prior he was basically either a storyboard (Gundam Victory) or episode director roles (Ranma \u00bd). An anime about mental illness gives the impression of something similar in tone to a Satoshi Kohn (Paranoia Agent), but would it be as cryptic and/or illusionary is the question.\r\nWelcome to the NHK (why it is actually named this, who knows) is about a college dropout whom develops a mentalillness turning into a hikikomori (high-end social anxiety). The illness keeps the main character named Sato in his apartment in a state of constant paranoia and isolation. One day a young high school girl named Misaki gets Sato to sign a contract with him to help with his disease. There are a number of arcs from there where Sato goes through various forms social disorders or psychoses from gaming addict to falling for pyramid schemes. As strange as the show is and really \u201cout-there\u201d Welcome to the NHK does this in an entertaining way.\\n\\n\r\nAll in the meanwhile is focused around his encounters with Misaki and working with his neighbor. NHK is about a real people facing real issues in life with realistic mental issues. The most recurring theme is people being dishonest with their feelings and coming to terms with themselves and Sato is no exception. There is the issue like in the anime Nana where drug use is hidden in the anime adaptation which takes many important aspects of the show away, but not really damaging. Art and animation styles at times change drastically when Sato goes through crazy delusions and personality shifts. This kicks the viewer into something new which can be taken for both good and bad.   \\n\\n\r\nWelcome to the NHK is a strange show and it is not afraid of taking things too far. This might throw many anime viewers away. NHK is full of genuine drama involving the characters with nice development even though it is all over the place. Laugh at society, laugh with the characters, and definitely at least give the show a good try.",

One of a kind.\r\nA long time ago i read the novel Welcome to the NHK, the source material that this anime was based on. Recently, i started watching the anime. It took me a long time to start it because the art and animation in the first episode felt subpar to many current shows, which is understandable since it's more than a decade old. but after i got past that and continued to watch more episodes, i got completely hooked. \r\nWelcome to the NHK is a show that is unlike any other anime out there. It tacklesmany difficult subjects, such as mental illness, personality disorders, post traumatic stress, scams, depression and suicide. These are things the characters deal with, so naturally there will be some dark scenes and depressing situations. However, if you can handle that, then the show balances this out by presenting a lot of comedy, as well as hopefulness. This may sound weird, but somehow they pulled it off and it works.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is a shut-in, who doesnt work or go to school. He's slowly losing his grip on life, and falling deeper and deeper into his hole. A mysterious girl starts to help him, and they agree to meet at the park every night so she can give him a psycho-therapy lesson. He also has a neighbor who he knew as a youngster, and together they decide to make a computer game together. Those are the three main characters, and throughout the show, they become aware of their weaknesses and try to improve themselves and each other in their own way. However, they often hit obstacles and drawbacks. Our main character also develops feelings that he has trouble accepting and doesn't know how to handle. I can not overstate how much I wanted to see what happens to these characters, that's how drawn i was to this show, which does not happen that often for me anymore when it comes to anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall atmosphere is amazing. sometimes there is a lazy summer sun-washed vibe, sometimes melancholic and nostalgic, and sometimes there are frantic rushes of panic and dementia. The music is also a highlight, featuring many songs that I really liked and matched well with the mood. Sometimes the art leaves more to be desired, but it didnt hold back my enjoyment because there was so many other things to appreciate about it.\\n\\n\r\nI've watched over 100 anime shows, and when I finished Welcome to the NHK (in less than a week), I immediately put this in the top 5 of my favorites list. A show like this is very rare, and if you can handle the subject matter, it is a absolute gem. There is no other show that does this nearly as well.",

            "content": "NHK ni Youkoso! What do I think? \r\nSummary: A lot of people feel very alone, the abundance of loneliness is extreme in our everyday lives. Life can be hard, and this anime truly shows how hard life can be for people that are referred to as ''Hikikomori,'' which sort of means ''Recluse.'' \r\nSatou Tatsuhiro is a 22 year old guy who lives alone in his one-room apartment.\r\nSatou's life is full of misery, denial & sadness. He doesn't have the will to get a \r\njob, he is not excited about meeting anybody and he lives a unhealthy, careless life. \r\nThis anime follows the course of Satou's\"therapy\" or \"counseling\" that he receives from a local girl called Misaki, as well as other misadventures which involves various characters, but not a grand amount.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The story manages to thread through several situations, show the background of the most important characters in an astounding way which I initially thought was going to be impossible. I am thoroughly impressed by the story, as well as the narrative that is provided by the main character.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is simple, and can sometimes look very low-budget. The style is very mid-2000's, isn't overly moe in any way and adapts more of a realistic artstyle.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music is memorable, I will probably remember this opening in 10-15 years from now. The voices, as well as the ambience are well-placed and invokes all sorts of feelings during the anime's progression.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Without turning every single character overly depressed, I am very impressed by how the director; Yamamoto, decided how the character development would progress. Seemingly all of the characters manage to learn from their mistakes, while at the same time mimicking true human feelings and struggles. The main characters are enjoyable and will make you fall in love with them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: NHK ni Youkoso! makes me enjoy understanding the fact that sadness, loneliness and struggles, are something we all feel and must endure. I truly hope that I am not the only one who felt extremely well and happy after watching this. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I would recommend this to anyone. Even the most successful, high-profile businessmen, managers, executives should watch this. This anime glimpses into true emotional torture. It also shines a light on a part of society who is in pain, both mentally and socially. If you are planning on watching this, I can only say, get ready for your mind to be twisted around. Get ready to laugh, get ready to love and cry. Maybe all of them at the same time? Welcome to the NHK!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Before I began watching this, I had heard a lot of things about this anime. I basically knew that this is the famous \"hikikomori anime\" and I knew how the story somewhat goes. But I only recently decided to watch this. I must say I was pleasantly surprised, since this anime got a spot in my top-5 after just a few episodes.\r\nThis anime tells a story about different people, that are all a bit, should I say, \"strange\" if they are judged according to society's norms. The story revolves mostly around Satou Tatsuhiro; the main character of this anime that has a part in everystory. Satou has been a hikikomori for a past 3 years and has no hopes or dreams for the future. Then, something happens. He happens to meet a girl named Misaki Nakahara, who wants to cure Satou of his hikikomori ways. The story slowly progresses through different smaller stories, that usually deal with other problems in modern society. I found it extremely easy to identify with Satou and other characters of this anime, which is one of the reasons why this is one of the best animes I have seen. One of the other reasons is the story itself, it was very interesting to see how different people deal with different problems in this world. The story is told in such a way that you can easily sympathize with the characters and in this kinda anime that is very important. From time to time, this anime really makes you think about the themes it deals with. About the structure of society and how different people handle different situations. Most of the time though, the anime's story is not that gloomy and it has it's humorous parts too. The important themes are still there all the time, and that's what I like; what you get from this anime, depends on how you want to watch this anime. You can watch it as a funny and interesting anime, which it is. Or, you can watch it as a much more serious anime that deals with hard questions, which it is also. I think that works great and I that is why I really liked the way the story is told.\\n\r\nCharacters of this anime is another thing that I absolutely love. They are not your usual stereotype characters, but characters that are described so down-to-earthly that you can really share their sadness and happiness. I absolutely fell in love with Misaki, the character is just so sweet that she became one of my favorite anime characters. I also loved her voice, it was so perfect for that type of character. As I have already said, the story and the characters are very realistic, so it's easy to really like the characters. As the story proceeds, you will like the characters more and more. I am pretty emotional person, and it's not rare for me to actually cry a little when watching some good drama anime, and I can say that that was almost the case in this one also. The setting of this anime is just simply something that is easily possible in the real world, the situations of the characters are something that can really happen and I liked to watch an anime that deals with that kind of things for a change. The way every character act is also very natural.\\n\\n\r\nThe art also follows the realistic theme of this anime. The drawing style is mostly made to match the real world. That could also be because the anime itself plays pretty important role in this anime, and it would be good for the viewer to realize, for example, are the posters in the wall pics of real girls or anime girls, that are drawn differently. I also liked that, because once again, that made the anime feel more realistic. The music was pretty basic, and there weren't anything special about it. Not bad, but not anything more than good. I liked the opening though, endings were also good, especially the first one, it's theme really fitted in this anime. As I mentioned before, Misaki's voice is perfect, and I also like the voice acting of other characters also.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is something you should definitely watch, no matter what kinda animes you usually like, I don't see any reason why you wouldn't like this at some level. At best, this anime can really make you think differently. I personally grew to love the characters so much that I will definitely buy the original novel.\\n",

Overall its a dark twist of slice of life showing us how its not always fun and cutesy like lucky star. This anime is not for the person that doesnt enjoy the dark out look on life but i highly recommend it to all that enjoy people suffering.",

            "content": "Going into this series, I didn't know what to expect and had no idea what it was about. I assumed it would be good because of reviews I had seen on different websites, but nothing prepared me for how funny, immersive and tragic N-H-K is. I only hesitate to use the word \"deep\" because of how that word has been tainted by being used to describe even the most shallow and simple anime.\r\nDespite being able to stand as a great anime on its humour alone, the real beauty of N-H-K comes from its exploration of the depths of human misery and loneliness and its excellentportrayal of weak and desperate people who are all suffering in their own way. We are introduced to characters struggling with their crushing social anxieties, phobias, self-worth, confidence, dark pasts and ultimately, their uncertainty of whether their lives are worth living.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t think another anime exists that so perfectly balances the vast array of emotions and content Welcome to the N-H-K has. At times it\u2019s hilarious while at others it\u2019s confusing, suspenseful, dramatic or sad. Romantic, conspiracy and psychological themes such as suicide, escapism, and the most relevant, hikikomori, are all wonderfully expressed. References from Japanese pop-culture and otaku and lolicon sub-culture are drawn from, most of which even a casual anime viewer can appreciate. It's just a little touch that adds to the uniqueness and feel of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all this was a refreshing anime to see... It had been a while since another anime had touched me the way N-H-K did. If you like anime like Evangelion, Lain or Paranoia Agent because of their psychological content, you should enjoy Welcome to the NHK just as much. \\n\r\nBut even if those types of anime aren\u2019t your cup of tea, Welcome to the NHK\u2019s comedy and story can still satisfy you. The story is not as abstract and confusing as Lain or Paranoia agent, so don\u2019t be turned off just because it deals with similar themes.\\n",

            "content": "I'm just an average everyday watcher, so take what you read with a grain of salt.\r\nSo NHK ni Youkoso! or \"Welcome to the NHK\" for us English speakers, is a slice of life psychological anime about Satou Tatsuhiro. He's a 22 year old, unemployed \"hikikomori\" living on his own. He hasn't talked to another person for about a year, and hasn't left his apartment for 4 years. He believes an evil organization known as the NHK has doomed him to this fate of being an anti-social loser. One day, he  comes into contact with a young girl named Misaki, who claims she can curehis hikikomori disease and make him a productive member of society. From there, literally EVERYTHING that could go wrong, does, and it's amazing.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, NHK has 4 main characters, Satou and Misaki being 2 of them. Also, there is Satou's old Classmate Hitomi, who believes in the NHK and conspiracies just as much, if not more than Satou. Then there is Yamazaki, another school acquaintance of Satou's who just happens to live next to him, and also just so happens to be a fanatical misogynist and otaku. Satou and his friends get mixed up in everything from pyramid schemes, to porn addiction to hentai games, and that's just the tip of the iceberg! Even though all the main characters are very messed up and sometimes even despicable, we can all find something we relate to in them, and the struggles they go through. While the show does have a lot of comedy, it also has a lot of drama and often t's hard to tell if what you are watching IS comedy, drama, or both!\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is good for the most part. The characters are well designed, move realistically (for the most part) and have very detailed and expressive faces, looking more run down than a lot of other animes, fitting with the tone. However, there are times where the animation goes for good, to flat out horrible, with characters turning into caricatures of their former selfs and not moving so much as teleporting from place to place. It is clear they didn't use their budget wisely. But, it's not unwatchable, and once again, the majority of the time the show looks just fine.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is fantastic, the soundtrack is only beat out by Cowboy Bebop as one of my favourites. Songs are used repeatedly throughout the  show, but they all sound great, are used at the right time, and never overtake what is happening onscreen, only enhancing it. The score reminds me of something I'd hear in an indie movie. The first opening and ending themes are amazing too, and the second ones are also pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nThe subject matter of this anime is VERY questionable. This is definitely not a show you want to show to kids, and some adults may even be turned off by it for how disturbing and perverse it can be. The show pokes fun at porn, MMORPGS, and of course, otakus. When you've made an anime that calls out it's main demographic, you've got some balls! The anime is so hell bent on sending a message that it almost becomes a subversion of slice of life anime, which I can totally get behind!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Welcome to the NHK is an all around amazing series. It's got the addictiveness and watch-ability of a slice of life, but has a lot of substance behind it. It can go from disturbing to heartwarming to funny to sad, and sometimes all within the same episode! At 24 episodes, it's worth a watch.",

            "content": "Note: This review is a copy of my own review I posted on AniDB under the name Mortsyn.\r\nWelcome to the N.H.K is a really unique anime in the fact that it tries more to tell an otaku how your life really is, instead of trying to give otakus what they wanna see. And is that a bad thing? No way, Jos\u00e9! This anime wants to tell you to fix your life straight and not to be a NEET and/or otaku for your entire life, because it brings you nothing but sadness in the long run.\r\nAnimation: NHK never really impressed me with its animation style, butthe character designs and the main character's dreams were very nicely done and put together. Even though it never really impressed me, I can't disclose the fact that it had really solid body movements on the characters. However, in some episodes (very few, maybe 2-3) you could clearly see that the animation style was completely different. Think of it sorta like K-On!'s style of animation, you know, like fast, blury and waterish kind of movements. And even though I don't hate that art style, I did think that it felt sorta out-of-place in a show like this. \\n\\n\r\nSound: It was a long time since I last watched this anime, so I can't really remember much of the soundtrack (which is of course NOT a good thing, since OST's are something that should stick with you 'till the end). But as for the openings and endings, they will stick with me for life. The opening was preformed by Round Table featuring Nino and is called Puzzle and is still to this date one of my favourite intros ever. I just love the trumpet in the song! And then it disappears in the second opening preformed by the same band and the name of the song is the same, only with the added sentence (Extra Hot Mix)... Extra hot... Yeah right... Removing the trumpet and replacing it with a generic guitar tune was one of the biggest mistakes they ever did in this anime sound wise. The first ending was preformed by Kitsutaka Fumihiko and Ootsuki Kenji and is called Odoru Akachan Ningen. What can I say? Just listen to it! How can you not love it?! The second ending was sung by Makino Yui (who voiced Misaki in the show, might I add) and is called Modokashii Sekai no Ue de, and saddly, it was not in any way memorable... But hey! Atleast we still have Mysterious Purupuru Pururin!! As for the voice acting, solid performance all the way through by everyone.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Alright, the story is about Satou Tatsuhiro who is a hikikomori who later reunites with his high school junior Yamazaki Kaoru, and the two decides to make an eroge! Now, it may sound like a boring ass story, but it later evolves into something much different, for better or worse... Satou's life starts to change after he meets Nakahara Misaki and, as with Yamazaki, reunites with his high school senior Kashiwa Hitomi. Both whom will change is life forever. But as far as the story development goes, I thought it was one of the best story in any anime in this department. Untill that fateful episode 14. This is where the story took a massive turn, and in my opinion, I got disappointed... HARD! It did however get better by the end.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: NHK did not have that huge of a cast, and mostly contained a bunch of side-characters. But the actual main characters were some of the best! How can you not love Misaki with her cuteness and her relationship with Satou, how can you not love Yamazaki with his nerdyness, and how the hell can you not love Satou for just being Satou?! All of them were really entertaining in their own special way which made this anime more enjoying than what it would have been, if these characters weren't in it. Oh, and don't forget Pururin! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This is definitely the kind of anime that will entertain you because it gives you so much. It gives you comedy, drama, romance, thrills and much, much more. And even though some parts of the show were really boring (hint: mmorpg) it did not fail to deliver when it was being serious.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't really the kind of anime that I think I will rewatch that soon in the future, but it did have something to it that makes you wanna watch it again. For me, I would definitely say that the main reason to rewatch this anime is because of the characters. But if I do, I might actually go with the manga instead, probably because it features a different ending and a bunch of other elements that did not appear in the anime, same goes with the novel.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Welcome to the N.H.K is a really good anime that everyone who watches a ton of anime should watch. It should give you a bigger insight of your own life and what you do, aswell as how it affects those around you. So NHK is an anime, even though it has its fair share of flaws, that I would definitely recommend to anyone and everyone!",

            "content": "\"A drama has a progressive plot, an emotional climax, and a resolution. But our lives aren't like that. All we get day after day are a bunch of vague anxieties that are never really resolved.\" - Kaoru Yamazaki\r\nI'm antisocial. I'm sure a lot of you guys are antisocial as well. There are some, however, who take this state of antisocialism a bit too far. These people are what are referred to in Japan as \"hikikomori\". In Welcome to the NHK, the entire plot is focused around hikikomori and their lives. The show itself doesn't always use this as its basis, as it will often displaycountless other problems and struggles in peoples' lives, such as suicide, mental illness, and struggling to survive in the world. Since I just have to tell someone about how great this show is, let me share with you what I think about Welcome to the NHK.\\n\\n\r\nStory and Characters:\\n\r\nTatsuhiro Satou is a college dropout living alone in an apartment at Mita House which he pays for with as much money as he can milk out of his parents every month. As you might have guessed, he's a hikikomori. Satou suffers from what must be many mental illnesses (without spoiling much) and thinks that everything bad that happens to him is the product of some conspiracy. Who's behind all of this? Why, the NHK of course! The Nihon Hikikomori Kyoukai (Or Japanese Withdrawal Association). Someone eventually notices that Satou has a problem, and that just happens to be the attractive young Misaki Nakahara. Misaki eventually gets Satou to sign a contract that forces him to take her \"classes\" on recovering from being a hikikomori.\\n\\n\r\nI have absolutely no problems at all with NHK's story. It's perfect. It flows well, it constantly adds in new elements without giving it a burdened feeling, and it keeps to what it does best and doesn't try too hard to add anything more than what it knows is good. It's storytelling like NHK's that I really appreciate and wish I could see more of. A lot of the situations that the characters find themselves in are often relatable and really make you fell for them think about what their minds are going through. It really shows you the different perspectives on life that people have and how terrible real life is. In contrast, it also shows you the good in life so that you can recover from all of the terrible situations you've seen and show you that life is only as good or as bad as you make it. I really love where NHK went with this, and I think it's one of the most best ideas for an anime I've ever seen. Another great thing about the show is the interactions between the characters. Every character brings something new to NHK's table of crippling depression, but more often than not they add a lot of humor to the series. (Which, might I add is one of the other high points of the series) Overall, they'll make you laugh your ass off and bawl your eyes out. Trust me, if you like good storytelling and even better characters, Welcome to the NHK is for you.\\n\\n\r\nLet me just clear something up right now with as little spoilers as possible. Hate to do this in the middle of a review but I have to let you know, there MAY BE A FEW MINOR SPOILERS up ahead in the next paragraph. I'm very sorry, but don't say I didn't warn you.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing I really hated about NHK's story was its ending. It made a big dent in an otherwise flawless story. If you were to compare it to the rest of the series, you'd be pretty disappointed in the development of some of the characters and their situations up to the end. Most of the supporting cast gets some sort of conclusive ending, but with the mains it really doesn't feel like a lot has changed other than a few improvements. I'm not saying I hate the entire last episode, just where they left off with it. If you don't like romance without resolution, you're gonna have a bad time when it comes to NHK's ending. Let me tell you, you'll get pretty frustrated if you're not into that kind of thing.\\n\\n\r\nNow that I've gotten that out of the way, let's move on to something else.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Art:\\n\r\nThe animation and art style in NHK is obviously dated. It is an older series after all (if you consider 2006 old), but it's definitely not perfect. You can really tell the time period they were going for with it too, especially in the way they display the general atmosphere. There really isn't a lot to say about the animation since that's nowhere close to what the series is about, but it wasn't bad at all. It was just kind of bland and dated in most parts. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and Voice Acting:\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for the show is amazing as well. The opening theme song is catchy and remains one of my favourites right now. (That is until they released the so called \"extra hot mix\". How is it extra hot if you remove that glorious trumpet solo?!) Almost the entire soundtrack is acoustic, I believe, and it gives off the same vibe as the animation does. It matches with the feeling that the show wants to give you very well. My favourite songs from the soundtrack are \"Puzzle\", the opening theme song, and a track called \"Hitori Bocchi\" or \"Loneliness\" in English. It's a really sad song when you listen to the way it's played and read the lyrics. It always makes me feel either good or bad when I listen to it, but most of all it makes me want to rewatch the show. That's the kind of thing more shows need to do with their soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nWhat might be one of the largest problems with me next to the ending is the voice acting in both the Japanese and English dubs. Most of it is just okay, and is good enough to pass for a better-than-average show, but I absolutely abhorred some parts of the show because of it. I'm actually unable to watch some scenes because of how cringy the voice acting is. (In the English dub at least, but the Japanese one has its problems too) As for whether you should watch it dubbed or subbed, I'd suggest the dub in all honesty. It adds a lot more to the show, makes it a bit easier to watch, and it even injects its own humor that wasn't originally there. I'd also recommend the dub if you're a fan of Greg Ayres like me. How does he have that voice? It fits so well!\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\r\nWelcome to the NHK is one of my absolute favourite anime. I think it almost makes it up there with Clannad in terms of emotional real-life shows. However, its shortcomings bring it pretty close to becoming less of a masterpiece than it already is. All in all, nearly every element of the show was absolutely perfect. It brings so much emotion and relatability that it's just so hard not to love it. Other than a few complaints I have about the end of the series, the ending was overall very pleasing despite a few things I really didn't like.\\n\\n\r\nLet me finish this review by saying that this series is probably the most masterfully done rom-com I've ever watched...wow, did I really just say that? Regardless, I think this is pretty much something that every self-respecting anime fan should give a quick watch just to see what it's all about. It's enjoyable for almost anyone, whether they be new to anime or have watched more series than they can count. Welcome to the NHK will make you laugh and cry, it will make you feel the emotions that the characters experience, and most of all it will give you a real-life experience that no other show could possibly do.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you've just watched the show or have just started watching it, then allow me to welcome you...to the NHK!\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\n9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n8.8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n9.8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\n9.3/10",

            "content": "You ever get that feeling that there's something you're supposed to watch, but you don't know what it is? Some vague idea, some faint silhouette, some distant notion or sense of what this thing is -- but you've never seen it and never heard of it and don't even know its name? For me, that show was Welcome to the NHK -- and I had been searching for this show for years. \r\nThis is a show that has no right to be as good as it is. It has no right to make me relate to characters who themselves are incapable of relation to otherpeople. It has no right to forge a compelling plot where no plot exists at all. It has no right to bend me over in laughter one moment and punch me in the gut the very next when I'm most vulnerable. It has no right to penetrate so deeply and so profoundly into my mind, my life, and my experiences and force me to confront myself and my fears and all the things in life from which I've run away. But it does, and it pulls it off magnificently. I've never seen anything quite like it, and part of me hopes I never see anything quite like it again so that I never forget the feeling I had when I first finished it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned, there's barely a plot to speak of. The show gravitates around Tatsuhiro Sato -- a NEET, social recluse, and hikikimori  -- and a good portion of the show transpires either within the confines of his room or the confines of his mind. One day, he meets a pretty young teenage girl, Misaki Nakahara, who coaxes him out of his room and ropes him into daily counseling sessions in the nearby park to cure him of his condition as a hikikimori. Along the way, he reunites with a couple of old friends, and the show follows the misadventures of Sato and his band of equally messed up compatriots as they get mixed up in summer festivals, comic conventions, pornography, MMORPG's, pyramid schemes, and various bouts of suicidal tendencies. \\n\\n\r\nIn a way, I feel bad giving this an 8/10 in terms of story because the term \"story\" has a connotation of referring to the strength of plot -- and this show, while it lacks a strong narrative thrust to its plot like Death Note or Steins Gate, doesn't really need a plot. Like life itself, it follows a series of loosely related vignettes with common themes and anxieties, and none of them are ever fully resolved. And that's okay. Life itself often lacks closure unless we ourselves supply said closure. In that sense, the show stays true to life, and thus its story becomes one of its greatest virtues -- even if it's not successful in terms of how one would typically define narrative success.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt -- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI also feel weird giving the art an 8/10. The art style and color palate are typically quite down-to-earth, which, while lacking in visual exuberance, ultimately reinforces the grounded nature of the show. I say \"typically\" because the show shows countless flashes of imaginative direction and dizzying imagery, particularly in Sato's hallucinations and schizophrenic episodes where everything becomes unhinged and we see an unfettered visual rendering of his psychological traumas and neuroses. And for the most part, the art, when not rendering giant sea snakes or talking refrigerators in Sato's visions, is really quite good and well-drawn. But then, for some reason, some episodes are just loaded with QUALITY out the wazoo -- and these moments stand out more against the typically polished animation of the show. Maybe there were some budgetary or production issues -- I don't know. Again, though, for the most part, the show looks good -- and there are times when it's visually powerful. But that's not the show's greatest strength.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters --10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the show solidifies itself as a masterpiece in my mind. It proves once and for all that great characters don't have to be likable -- because for the most part, the characters on the show are objectively *difficult* to like. There is, of course, Sato, whose laziness, negligence, reclusion, and social awkwardness all compound to create a character that most of us would turn away from on principle were we to meet them in the real world. There's Misaki, who initially appears as a normal, benign girl but is soon revealed to be just as messed up as Sato -- if not more so -- and she's quite manipulative on top of that. There's Sato's old Senpai, Hitomi, an absolute bombshell whose belief in conspiracies tainted Sato's worldview in the first place and whose constant ennui and self-medicating indicate a deeply troubled, deeply unhappy person. And, of course, Yamazaki -- Sato's former classmate whose penchant for hentai and moe make him a natural target for repulsion and resentment. And yet, I loved them. Every single one. Even when they did dumb things or they failed or they manipulated Sato (which happens a lot -- everyone manipulates Sato on multiple occasions), I still loved them. I saw myself. I saw all my problems personified and realized. My sadness, my doubts, my sexual anxieties, my paranoia, my belief that anyone who displays even an ounce of kindness towards me is secretly plotting to hurt me -- I saw it all. They're horrible people with good hearts who have been hurt so much in life that they don't always realize what they're doing. They are the heart and soul of this show, and the journey they undertake was a joy and privilege to bear witness to. And the end of that journey stopped at a place that at once left me feeling immensely satisfied and begging for more -- at a point of transition in the lives of both the audience and the characters. As though saying, \"Life is filled with pain, yes, but your past does not necessarily have to define your future. Where you go from here is entirely up to you. Make the most of it.\"\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the soundtrack and voicework are killer. There's a moment at the end of an episode about halfway through the season (I won't say which one for fear of spoilers) where Sato's voice actor tore my heart of my chest and left me in silence for about half an hour. And Hittori Bocchi is a damn beautiful track.",

            "content": "Welcome to the NHK - 10/10\r\nYou know, this is probably the closest anime will ever get to literature.\r\nIt's a slice of life story about a hikkikomori shut in, also adaption of the novel NHK ni Youkoso!. The only difference between the anime and the novel is that Anime is leaning towards a much more positive experience than the depressing novel. Major differences include the use of drugs in the novel where there were none in anime (except Hitomi), lolicon illegal pornography on Yamazaki's computer and that Yamazaki in the anime did not try to cause a terrorist attack like he did in the Novel.\r\nTL;DR -Anime is less grim than the novel\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's not what people tend to think it is. It's not a story about a hikkimori shut in. It's about a bunch of people's lives and their own personal struggles, against themselves and maybe the whole world too. Hitomi has many disorders that no hospital classes as diseases and they just brush her off and give her normal pills and she also leads an imaginary life with Sato as a violent husband in it. Sato is a hikkikomori with an idea that everyone looks down upon him and behind the scenes thinks of him as a low level scum, which leads to him not loving himself thus not trusting others and escaping from the fear of getting rejected by rejecting everything from the start and this becoming a hikkikomori. Yamazaki is an Otaku who takes it all to the extreme, but still tries to remain a normal person and tries to make contact to girls who only reject him because he is a \"creepy otaku\" which then forces him to become even more of an otaku and try to delude himself further in escapism, failing and then repeating the circle, he is so used to being rejected he ironically showed it to his love interest and just offended her heavily because he automatically thought she'd hate him because he's an otaku - which makes the whole situation incredibly complicated. Misaki, who had daddy issues which initially led her believing she is somehow lower than everyone else, which then forces her to try and be helpfull to her grandma and people in general, she thinks that nobody actually needs her, and only needs her services which is why she made the whole project of helping Sato stop being a Hikkikomori, she also ended up needing him because he was \"below\" her, so basically worse at life than her and she needed to help him to make herself feel better that she can, and does help someone, and that there are people weaker than her.\\n\r\nInchel and her brother both in deep financial trouble due to marketting pulling them into a financial pyramid with no getting out, while Inchel's brother is playing online games to earn some little cash, Inchel is trying to lure people into the pyramid (even though she thinks it's wrong) to try and get promoted, she simply hasn't got a choice but to act like an asshole.\\n\r\nTL;DR : It's about a bunch of people in hard real life situations.\\n\r\nNow here's my story with this show.\\n\r\nI started it about three months ago and dropped at the 2nd episode, because at the time i was starting to get bored like shit by all of those slice of life animes and move on to something a little more fast-paced and complex which at the time to me was Sword Art Online.\\n\r\nHowever, now having watched loads of titles, classics and new ones among which are some of the shows that took a very special place in my heart like Neon Genesis Evangelion, Ergo Proxy, Cowboy Bebop, Serial Experiments Lain, FLCL, Kill La Kill and many more i have decided to come back to Welcome to the NHK.\\n\r\nAnd damn i was well surprised by the turn the story made. Instead of a plain hikkikomori otaku stereotype made exclusively for self-inserting we have very deep character development and dare i say, a psychological look into the mind of the character and his relations with his peers aswell as the rest of the world. \\n\r\nSure it doesn't go to the scale of Evangelion's infamous episode 25 where it breaks the character into pieces using thorough psychoanalysis as to why they pilot a big shiny robot, but the thing is, less is more. If the writer does a good job, which they did in NHK, then the whole thing does not have to be on such a huge scale which is exactly what Slice Of Life genre is for (more specifically the drama/romance subgenre). Another thing is that the OST for this anime is high-quality and well composed (the show even has it's own motif which is played in various fragments on various instruments and at different speeds), aswell as visuals which are good and are used nicely to show what the story is all about and more important, what is going on inside Sato's head using light-hearted comedy of sorts. The thing i really liked is that the characters aren't stereotypes, unless they are there for irony (for example Yamazaki being an otaku and making a hentai game). It is not a secret that show deals with mature, but not very grim and edgy themes but still generally carries a very depressive tone (Misaki's suicide attempt, The Offline meeting episode) while still managing to insert comedy into places where appropriate, all building up into something unique and just feel very real. Very damn real. Nothing is taken to an extreme, but done just right. Especially those bits of struggle how Sato was scared to be rejected, so he tried to hide away from everyone and all those feeling that hurt him, making matters worse, he saw his friend getting rejected and saw that it wasn't too nice of a feeling to experience.\\n\r\nAll of course excluding the bit where he just meets a random girl on the street willing to save him, but at least the romance is very entertaining, funny and romantic.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was a bit meh, but then it seemed just right, as Misaki and Sato didn't just magically become all happy, but they found each other in their weird and unique relationship \"hostages by exchange\" huh? Nice.\\n\\n\r\nAfter seeing the anime, i felt like i just read a really good book and listened to an amazing music album. It's not what you normally get after watching an anime, but it was a feeling entirely unique, like i completely bonded with the characters.\\n\r\nWelcome To The NHK is definitely one of the best animes i've ever seen and i will never forget it's themes and other things it does.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - Go fucking watch it's as good as drama gets.",

            "content": "NHK is an emotional gem. The story is not told, but felt. It moves with a flow that highlights the characters development and struggles as they interact with each other and cope with their own conflicts. The story line is not special nor unique, but it's what puts emphasis on all the characters as individuals. The series would certainly not be a gem without this simplicity. It doesn't attempt  to find a hole where it can poke into the brains of the audience and invoke a sense of adrenaline or attempt to execute a story never done before. It does just the opposite: itspeaks to our human side and does so without trying. It's mellow and simple; it's joyless and dull. It's the story line that we humans follow in our everyday lives. It's the struggles some of us go through daily and the impact the days going by have on us. It's patchy in places and there are several unnecessary things in the story, but it's what makes up life of the human being. It's us who have patches and unnecessary happenings in our life. It's us who are left to wonder and ponder about our surroundings. Only human beings can repeat a cycle that makes them unsure and miserable all while preventing love in fear of rejection. We're left in an office chair spinning, staring at the ceiling, eating doughnuts, but not understanding why. It all seems so humorous on the surface. On the surface a man spinning in an office chair staring at the ceiling with a doughnut in his mouth seems more than humorous, but for the thoughts that travel through his mind no one else knows what pain it may be causing. It's the story, right before the characters, that is told in such a wonderful and simple way that it invokes feelings of confusion, relation, and calmness. The pace, the way the episodes fit together, and the development of the plot are all bounce off of each other. They all are wonderfully done in an overly simple way that leaves one wondering of their soul. The only reason the story line does not have a ten is because the romantic and comical aspects of the show were terribly done. Luckily, the story line focused on the psychological conflicts of human beings and the drama that comes along with it, so I have little complaint. It did however hinder my rating. I left with a gem, but I did expect to be presented with some comedy and romance--both were badly done. \\n\\n\r\nThe art wasn't special. It didn't catch my eye nor make me want to cover my eyes. The characters had a fairly distinguishable attractive appeal and the environment was nicely animated. It wasn't memorable, but it fit the story magnificently. They matched the characters greatly and helped assure the overall mood. \\n\\n\r\nI have only watched the English dub, so I am speaking in terms of such. I did feel they could have done a bit better with the English voice actors in this anime, but the voice actors did such a good job of acting out the conflicts that it eventually left my mind by the fifth episode. They matched the characters personalities well, but none of the characters voices were unique or memorable. The only reason the voices remain memorable in my mind is due to the characters themselves. Which, it's pretty hard for me to fawn over a character and not recall their voice. The background music did a fantastic job of putting greater emphasis to the characters and the struggles everyone was going through throughout the story. Hitori Bocchi and Puzzle are the only notable songs to me. Though, pururin was quite funny.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime were really what made this anime amazing. As I'll cycle again from what I said about the story line, it's not the minds of an anime character that I felt when watching the characters. It's the pure natural struggles of individuals with their own individual troubles. Each character had an enormous amount of depth while some of it wasn't revealed, but what was revealed was done so brilliantly. While the flaws of human beings were much more of focus in this anime, you can sense the good qualities of the characters based off of their actions. The characters reacted to situations extremely realistically and in a way that suited their personality. Their mannerisms and reactions to situations felt like that of a human being. I was able to relate to the main character especially, but all the characters in the anime could've caused one to relate easily or not so easily due to the depth. The character development is a tricky thing to summarize in this anime. At its base, the character development goes nowhere, but in its roots it went everywhere. Each character--some more than others--did noticeably grow as human beings. That's not what makes it difficult to summarize; it's the fact that by the end of the anime you could feel yourself sighing knowing it was for nothing that made me so hard to rate it. Though, I suppose that's another trick of this anime: to remind myself just how human I am. I could sense the baby steps taken throughout the movie like a dog, but at the end I was left with this terrible depressing feeling. In a way, I suppose I'd call it magical. The character development developed without it being obvious all while invoking our sensations, but at the end, it felt as though everything went back to stage one, and yet another natural cycle of conflict we face as humans was portrayed. Due to lack of revelation from all the characters through development, I'm giving this a nine.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime significantly. It still stays with me till this day and I find myself pondering my difficulties and myself as a human due to it. I was very depressed and found myself talking to myself in an overly poetic way after the anime. It's a very natural anime that leaves you with a natural feeling. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd recommend this to everyone: kids, teens, adults. Although it may not teach anything, it may teach everything, and if it fails to each anything it may make one feel everything. I can see why some people would find this anime unlikable or even terribly developed, but I feel like that would come from a lack of understanding. This anime is a very pure emotive anime; it's not colorful and it certainly doesn't try. It's dull in such a realistic way that I consider it brilliant. I highly recommend giving it a try.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "So you are thinking of watching NHK ni Youkoso!...?\r\nSato is a hikkikomori who happens to be on his best luck when by chance a girl he had seen at his appartment building approaches him and decides to \"save him\". \r\nI must say I did enjoy this show and found it very funny around the first half, though it became rather repetitive sometime into the middle of it. (I almost peed myself laughing the first time I heard the 1st ending :O How stupid)\r\nThere is however a flaw I find in this series that many perople overlook. I think there are two basic states about acharacter's personality: either it's likeable or relateable. Most characters are somwhere between these two, but Sato leans veeery strongly toward relateable. There is a problem with this: Not everyone can relate to him (which is my case).\\n\\n\r\nHe is in fact, in my opinion, borderline idiotic. The seiyuu doesn't help him at all, since he randomly shouts in anger whenever Sato does... well basically anything. (Not exactly very introverted... wait wasn't he a hikkikomori???). \\n\\n\r\nThis would be actually fine if he actually developed from this phase in any meaningful way (TBH he did, but he did all of the series' worth of development on the later half of the last chapter, not exactly even pacing if you ask me)\\n\\n\r\nMisaki (the girl) is another ticket, she is on the likeable side and is very well made, but is depthless until you actually learn about her past which is at best only hinted up until the last chapter when it is revealed. \\n\r\nThe stories are a disappointment, and felt as though the writers were trying to force them into the series to earn the socially inept's sympathy by making the characters do frankly stupid things *SPOILER* like being caught in a pyramid marketing scheme or becoming addicted to videogames or whatnot *SPOLIER END* \\n\\n\r\nSo in summary, the characters are very shallow and do not develop for 23 of the episodes, and the stories are par at best for that long (except for an actually very interesting flashback about Yamazaki), mainly because instead of using the stories to develop the characters, the writer decided to use them to get the audience to relate to them instead for the better part of the anime. Which may have led to more audience but definitely not to more quality.\\n\\n\r\nThanks\\n\\n\r\nSPOILER\\n\r\nI have seen a lot of people bitch about Misaki spying on Sato without telling him and how that is a good excuse for him to be an asshole to her or about how she said he was a useless person, but I honestly think otherwise, so if you care to try and change my opinion leave a message in my profile and I'llleave a message in yours telling you why I think what I think\\n\r\nSPOILER END",
