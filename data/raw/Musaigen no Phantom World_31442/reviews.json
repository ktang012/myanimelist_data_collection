            "content": "Over the past few years, I have been a witness to the slow death of KyoAni. First came Chuu2, a middling but otherwise inoffensive rom-com. Then came Kyoukai no Kanata, an absolute disaster of writing, and the creaking of KyoAni's creative efforts could start to be heard. And now, several more mediocre series later, we have Musaigen no Phantom World, a title so vapid and effortless that I believe KyoAni has finally reached the point of being irredeemable. KyoAni is dead. It is dead, and it's not coming back.\r\nIf not for the KyoAni name\u2014now worthless\u2014 nobody would have cared about what Phantom World has tooffer. It is your typical, uninspired rom-com that we get in the dozens every single year. There is nothing you have not seen here before, and nothing to inspire a viewing aside from the fact that it 'looks and sounds nice'. They stayed KyoAni on the outside, but on the inside they are merely a shallow, rotting husk of what they used to be.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not even worth the time to discuss the art of Phantom World. Anyone who has seen even a single KyoAni anime knows exactly what they're getting here. Their art no longer impresses me. I am also getting tired of forgiving their shows' terrible plots and characters just because they happen to look pretty. If all they are now capable of is drawing cute characters and flashy OPs and EDs, then perhaps they should leave anime and go work on manga and TV commercials instead?\\n\\n\r\nKyoAni seems to have forgotten what made previous titles like K-ON and Haruhi so successful: characters. There is not a character within the show who is developed in any meaningful way, and only one\u2014Kurumi\u2014 is even worth a damn, and that's not just because I love twintails and wish to be surrounded by twintailed beauties for the rest of my days. Kurumi is the only one who actually feels like a person and not just an assortment of tropes slapped together ('cool', 'big boobs', 'tsundere'). She acts remarkably her age; her seiyuu even goes as far as to stutter and poorly enunciate her words, as a girl in primary school would. Minase? I had to look through the character listing to even remember her name. \\n\\n\r\nPhantom World has another one of those 'dumb male friend' characters, similar to Ishiki from Chuu2, but manages to do so little with him that you forget he even exists. Not only is he a waste of space like just about every character in this show, but it is real tiring seeing all these pseudo-harem anime incapable of making a second male character who is actually a competent person and not just background fodder or some dumb, running gag. \\n\\n\r\nRuru, the show's mascot character, clearly exists only to sell merchandise and figures. Unlike, say, Tamako Market's Dera-chan, who was actually a unique and amusing character, the little fairy here is nothing but an annoyance. Her small size is quite fitting, being little more than a fly buzzing around in the protagonist's and the viewer's faces. It is also quite pathetic how the show attempts to make us care for her suddenly, the protagonist stretching his hand out towards the sky and screaming! Tears! Drama! Give me a break.\\n\\n\r\nPhantom World regularly treats its audience like it is a mass of buffoons who have never been to school. It uses\u2014you guessed it\u2014 Schrodinger's Cat in a vain attempt to seem more philosophical and meaningful than it actually is. Yes, we know what Schrodinger's Cat is. We are not idiots. It does not need to be explained to us for the umpteenth time in anime. The show even goes as far as to explain what a trojan horse is, as if we know absolutely nothing about the world and have been sitting on our mommy's lap sucking our thumb since the day we were born.\\n\\n\r\nNot only does Phantom World pull the awful transfer student trope, but the character is literally accepted into the school within hours of attaining their 'human form', and they do so without any form of identification or previous educational experience that would, you know, be necessary in a school transfer? It is true that the series is not attempting to be perfectly realistic, but if it wants to use the high school setting then at the very least it should actually try to have its high school resemble a high school. \\n\\n\r\nNothing interesting is done with the premise, aside from, say, creating excuses for nonsense like all the characters suddenly turning into cats. I'm sorry, but giving the girls cat ears and tail and making them end all their sentences with \"nyan\" does not do anything to improve the quality of the show. I enjoy cuteness in anime quite a bit, but the least KyoAni could do is try to make it more natural and less artificial, less like they are writing and structuring the anime by checking off boxes for everything that has ever been considered 'cute'. I half-expected there to be an episode where everyone starts calling the protagonist \"onii-chan\".\\n\\n\r\nThere are regular doses of fanservice, in scenes such as the main heroine, Mai, doing the limbo dance, her boobs jiggling and bouncing all over the place for the viewer's apparent satisfaction. Fanservice as a whole really needs to go away from anime, at least as far as its sexual incarnation is concerned. There exist hentai, doujins, eroge and other forms of pornography for a reason. If I wanted to feel aroused, I would watch or read one of the above-mentioned media\u2014they do it far better. I do not come to anime to see butts and panties and girls being licked by slimy monster tongues as if I am a child who does not know what porn or sex actually is. I love sexy things about as much as I love the story-driven stuff, but the two really need to not mix unless it is absolutely necessary. I can count on one hand the times an anime has been able to pull that off successfully. \\n\\n\r\nAt least Kyoukai no Kanata, as poorly-written as it was, could be given the slightest bit of credit for trying. Phantom World doesn't even do that much. It is as if KyoAni has accepted that their best days are forever behind them, and have now resigned themselves solely to producing lifeless, mediocre rubbish that will be forgotten after a month's time. Even producing something completely middling like Chuu2 now seems to be beyond their reach. Their in-house writers are so incompetent that they may as well just go back to adapting visual novels again; they've clearly demonstrated how incapable they are of doing anything themselves.\\n\\n\r\nPeople will still watch Phantom World because it is made by KyoAni. There are many people who still hold fond memories of the anime KyoAni used to make, and there are those who have only just started watching their more successful titles and do not yet know what the KyoAni of today is like. These fans are being manipulated and lured into watching a bad anime merely because it looks and sounds like a KyoAni title, and not because it is actually a worthwhile story on its own merits. It is a husk. Shiny it may be, but empty it is and will ever be. A sad sight indeed. \\n\\n\r\nBut the anime industry is a big place, and it will live on regardless, even if one of its most influential studios has withered away. Anime doesn't need KyoAni anymore. It's time to move on. I already have.",

            "content": "If there's something strange\r\nin your neighborhood\r\nWho ya gonna call?\r\nPHANTOM BUSTERS!\r\nMusaigen no Phantom World is what I like to call the King of Stereotypical! What do I mean by that? Well, let us begin the lecture! Take notes, young lads!\r\nHigh school setting? \r\nLight novel adaptation? \r\nMain character is a male, and the only male? \r\nMain character is also pretty darn useless? \r\nHarem of girls with different tropes? \r\nOne has big boobies? \r\nOne is flat? \r\nOne is a loli? \r\nAccidental fan service? \r\nBy Kyoto Animation? \r\nSee what I mean? This show is full of cliches! In fact, it's a bit too cliche. But the thing is, itisn't a bad show! One thing for sure is that it can get very entertaining! The animation and art is incredibly high quality, the soundtrack is also good, and the waifus are adorable! Sure, it's got no substance in terms of plot and whatnot, but really, waifus are the only reason you need to watch this show. \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Beautiful art and animation! A really great show to look at!\\n\r\n- OP is catchy and the soundtrack is good too! A great show to listen to!\\n\r\n- You get a waifu, he gets a waifu, she gets a waifu, everybody gets a waifu!\\n\r\n- Characters, albeit not developed or original in any sense, are still very likable!\\n\r\n- Entertaining action and jokes!\\n\r\n- Fanservice ;)\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- What is a story?\\n\r\n- What is character development?\\n\r\n- Generic as balls!\\n\r\n- Pretty boring MC.\\n\r\n- Fanservice ;-;\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nHmmm, is this even a story? Musaigen no Phantom World's story is all over the place, and by that, I mean it's absolutely nowhere. It's basically episodic, with each episode dealing with a different phantom or situation that has absolutely nothing to do with any of the other situations the characters faced. Any explanations throughout the story are undetailed or forced, the stakes aren't high at all, characters come and go on a whim, and yeah, it's basically just a really messy story. But some episodes do redeem this story from being a one, as some of them are actually pretty touching or funny! Either way, don't watch this show expecting a Shinsekai Yori tier story. Nah, don't do that.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nTake my money, Kyoto Animation, take my damn money, for Musaigen no Phantom World has some really high quality art and animation! In fact, the only reason it isn't a 10 is because it gets lazy sometimes. The action scenes are like borderline ufotable, and the character designs are so damn colorful and crisp to the maximum! Sometimes I feel like I'm watching Pokemon but with Fate/Stay Night UBW budget. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThat OP though, so damn catchy! The soundtrack is also good, although nothing to write home about. In reality, it's the seiyuus that shine in this series, for they definitely capture the \"characteristics\" (cause really, how characteristic can these waifus be?) of their characters! All in all, the sound is great, nothing special, but still up there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nWAIFUS!!!! So, besides the generic and boring MC, you got a nice selection of girls to add to your waifu collection. Sure, the waifus are generic as well, but they still have a lot of character and are really likable if thou art a casual. You got the hot tempered and big boobied Mai, who can beat anyone at limbo. You got the shy, flat, but incredibly moe Reina, who is one of those filthy bastards who can eat 5000 caloriesa day and gain 0 pounds. (Screw those guys). You have the underaged loli Kurumi, who is just pure moe (and a good reason to go to jail). You got Koito, the cold and serious one who, you guessed it, opens up to the MC for some reason. And of course, you got the little fairy Ruru, who is just there for comedic relief and midget fan service! Pretty unoriginal? Yes. Still likable? I guess?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nMusaigen is one of those ups and downs anime. Due to its episodic nature, some episodes will be better than others! While there were some that were kinda boring and a chore to sit through, there were some that were genuinely entertaining or even feels heavy! Those good episodes overshadowed the bad ones for me, but not everyone is gonna agree on that one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nGeneric, unoriginal, shit story, but not a bad show overall! It's another one of those entertainment > quality kind of shows, and I'm not a hater of those! Go you, Musaigen!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: I ain't afraid of no Phantoms.",

            "content": "Nearly every year for the past few years, we\u2019ve been getting a new series by Kyoto Animation. The studio alone invites attention as they are a powerhouse studio for high quality production in terms of technical visuals. But when it comes to storytelling, there\u2019s a mixed bag there. Just ask Kyoukai no Kanata. However, this is Myriad Colors Phantom World, a series about a group of teenagers dealing problems with Phantoms, creatures that comes in forms of all different shape and sizes due to imaginative perception. What I like to describe this show is a festival of fan service and nothing more than a punchin the face to fans who thought they were actually expecting some good.\\n\\n\r\nAdapting from the light novel of the same name, it\u2019s noticeable that the series itself has very limited volumes. Prior to the animation adaptation announcement, there was only 1 volume published until they decided to release another volume around Fall 2015. What does this mean? It basically implies that the show follows a lot of original concepts. Light novel adaptations are usually a big hit or miss and this is no exception. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s far from it. Myraid Colors Phantom World has a lot of potential that can be explored. What does it do instead? It executes a messy story with no coherent plot. Rather, it takes advantage of its female characters like the big boobed Mai and advertise them like a walking billboard of Ms. Fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode isn\u2019t just merely dumb but also trades its potentials for eye candy fan service. Now, I don\u2019t have a big problem with that as it should be expected from a show like this. The real problem is that the show strives on it and ante so aggressively that you\u2019ll soon find yourself wondering what the hell the show is really about. To paraphrase, the show is about an incident that happened 10 years ago that changed how humans perceive the world. And this incident also granted certain humans with special abilities to fight the Phantoms, mystical beings that pollute the world with their presence. The main male protagonist is Haruhiko, a young boy with the ability to seal Phantoms by drawing them into his sketchbook. Joining him on his quest is Mai Kawakami, a girl who can fight using an ability called 'Spirit of the Five Elements' that allows her to channel elemental energy into her fists. The problem with the duo is that their performance have been dreadful so they recruit new members to their team. In essence, the story is about these characters fighting phantoms although there will be times when you\u2019ll be scratching your head because of how farfetched the show attempts to focus on its gimmicks.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, we got Reina Izumi, a girl with a large appetite and ability to seal Phantoms by eating them. Koito Minase, a loner with the ability to use soundwaves and music to fight off Phantoms also gets involved in their affairs. The four main characters are basically established as crusaders to rid the world of Phantoms. As heroic as this sounds, the show is hard to take seriously with their daily misadventures and shenanigans. Almost all the characters suffers from some generic trait that is easily forgettable. Haruhiko is also a very dull male protagonist as it looks like the girls are often the ones dominating the missions and he is more of the supporting player. The show is also structured more based on individual characters for the first half of the series but Haruhiko gets almost no characterization at all. Even Kurumi, a little girl with a cute teddy bear gets her own spotlight episode while Haruhiko is on the sidelines drawing pictures and being nearly irrelevant. \\n\\n\r\nDespite my issue with the storytelling, the creativity of the series is actually quite fun to get attached to. Phantom World takes advantage knowing that and puts characters into imaginative worlds that seems to be inspired by other fantasy fiction. In addition, the show\u2019s Phantoms are all diverse and nothing seems repetitive with what the characters fight on a weekly basis. It also ties to their interpersonal problems at times so there\u2019s more purpose than trying to increase the team\u2019s performance scores.  On the other hand, the comedy is generally a miss. The lewd jokes quickly becomes old and repetitive with no sense of purpose other than being what it is. Then, there\u2019s Ruru, a character that adds nothing more than as a comical foil and often suggestive remarks. Many of the other comedic moments deals with the episodes themselves like cat shenanigans, awkward dialogues, and fan service that\u2019s shoved down our throats.\\n\\n\r\nAs with most Kyoto Animation series, the visual quality is solid. Ranging from the artistic backgrounds to the imaginative concepts, the studio puts a fair amount of effort to make the show look gloriously good. Character designs are what people will expect from the studio with a high concentration of colors. Then, there\u2019s of course the fan service. The camera really seems to have a fetish or something for Mai because every episode focuses on her body more than her character. Just watch the infamous limbo scene if you\u2019re wondering why. It also seems like her breasts bounces up and down nearly every episode like it\u2019s denting the laws of physics\u2026\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is moderate. Nothing more or nothing less is the easy way to say it. The OP song has some decent choreography while the ED song is very playful with the main girls. Character voice mannerism is also moderate although Ruru acts like she is trying to be as irritating as she can be each time she\u2019s on screen. Koito\u2019s cold personality is reflected in her voice and she has an emo-like voice mannerism that\u2019s easily forgettable. I guess that can be said the same for Haruhiko since he\u2019s about as dull as watching paint dry. The battle OST is another story though. That\u2019s actually quite decent.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a silly series in the end. Really, there\u2019s not much to it besides the show being somewhat self-aware and trying to capitalize on its premise. In the end, what it delivers is a less than average story but more of a generic fest of ridiculousness. And if you ask yourself why, it\u2019s probably because the show isn\u2019t met to be taken seriously in the first place. However, it\u2019s still a foolish show to embrace because almost every episode feels like a lazy grab bag of uncharacteristic ideas that\u2019s executed by the characters. There will be some episodes that have better characterization than the others. But for all it\u2019s worth, the show is a joke of itself. And it\u2019s not really funny at all.",

            "content": "There are many things I found interesting and not so interesting about Musaigen no Phantom World. Perhaps one of the most notable things about the damn show is that it's entire story, characters, and other plot related things are overused. During my time watching this show, it felt like I have literally seen this type of show with the same concepts, plot and similar characters way too many times.. It was too typical, better yet generic. Now, don't get me wrong the show itself is pretty decent, good amount of fan service, watchable and has its moments of where it stands out sometimes, however Ijust didn't think the original creator and KyoAni used their full potential while making the anime adaption. \\n\\n\r\nNow I won't go rambling on too much about how much I was dissatisfied with it. Because as mention earlier I said it was interesting, here is why. While the show may lack creativity the characters and entertainment that occurs during the show is actually at time completely enjoyable. a few of the things I liked most about it was that the episodes were sort of refreshing in a way. The show doesn't spend too much time focusing on many different and unnecessarily convoluted problems for like 2-3 episodes. Just about Every episode you can expect a new phantom to appear, new problems to develop plus you, well I got to enjoy seeing so much craziness occur.\\n\\n\r\nNow, back to characters again, I didn't really care for our main characters. As far as character personalities, appearance, and design the character sort of felt like, or came off as if they being forced to be cute. The guy, our plain, vanilla MC was so generic that I really cannot add any sort of personal opinion on him. I kid you not, and I am so glad many other users have noticed too, but there is a character like him every other anime season. \"plain\" \"generic\" \"Special power only the MC\" and same personality that is shared many other Main characters in shows like this. \\n\\n\r\nAside from them being boring I noticed that a lot of the characters special abilities were kind of ripped off from the series Date-A-Live. I only noticed this after watching the latest D.A.L. movie. both girls use their voices to attack and repel enemy attacks and Loli's both have an attachment to their animals, although one is a teddy bear and Yoshino's is a puppet.\\n\\n\r\nNow with that said, I cannot delve too much into characters being ripped off of each other. That is because original characters died around the late 90's or at the very latest early 2000s' If I had to guess I would personally say around 2002-2006 was the era in which OC characters died. In a way I do believe it makes since though because after time, the only logical thing to do is take old characters and try to mold them into your own characters. For example many artist and creators, like to take characters from other shows and add their own personal experiences to those characters and things usually take off from there.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on from characters and stuff, which agitated me for some odd reason, the animation was pretty damn fine. Characters were very well animated from their original designs. Lots of the fighting scenes were great, however not too special. There were some exciting moments and some less, overall I'd have to say a fair amount.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I ended up giving the show a 6/10 because there is lots of potential, or unused potential in this show. Overall I felt like it was Musaigen no Phantom World was simple. Nothing too extraordinary or extravagant enough worth mentioning. I personally believe that it will be a title that will soon be forgotten. Lastly, yes, I do have to agree that  it is not the best thing to come out of Kyoto animations... Animation was great, music was okay however the overall presentation was mediocre.. or \"Fine\" at best.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Musaigen no Phantom World is an anime that is both highly overrated and highly underrated. Wait a minute though, how can that be? Aren't those mutually exclusive? Not at all. To understand what is going on here, we must delve into some basic history of Kyo-ani.\r\n  For the past few years, Kyoani has been keeping this pattern of shows that feature cute girls with some supernatural elements thrown into a fairly straightforward story plus an overall lighthearted atmosphere. Amagi Brilliant Park, Kyoukai no Kanata, and to a lesser degree Chuunibyou are examples of this trend. And now comes Musaigen to add tothis growing pile.\\n\\n\r\n  The thing that seems to be annoying fans is that Kyoani is somewhat guilty of self plagiarism. The characters in Musaigan all feel somewhat...familiar. Very familiar. \"Didn't we see this character in that other show Kyoani did two years ago?\" familiar. Musaigen is also very episodic, which is something anime fans probably didn't want. The result is a lot of people love to hate this show. It gets put up on a spike and hailed around as proof that Kyoani is done for. They have nothing left. Problem with this mentality is it just isn't true. It's hating a show for reasons that have to do with other shows by the same studio, which doesn't really tell you much about the quality of Musaigen as a stand alone work. \\n\\n\r\n  On the flip side, rabid Kyoani fans who love everything they do absolutely gobble it up like it's another masterpiece. Musaigen is decent, but a masterpiece it is certainly not. The story is enjoyable and the characters are entertaining, but it's also very forgettable. The last couple of episodes of Musaigen was the only thing that made the show stand out from the rest. The only key ingredient that makes the show worth watching over others from the same season is the higher standard of art and animation quality that Kyoani generally aims for. \\n\\n\r\n The reality here is if Musaigen and Amagi switched air dates, they would probably switch critical reception as well. People would be hating on Amagi for being a clone of Musaigen. Musaigen, for all its troubles, isn't actually that bad.\\n\\n\r\n If you can look past the controversy and just judge Phantom World for what it is and not what you want it to be, it's a good weekend watch. Just don't expect anything seriously deep or amazing. Go into this show with realistic expectations and it's fairly enjoyable. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Many of my favorite reviewers rejected this series right away, which made me think negatively of it as well. After so much talk online following episode one\u2019s airing, I grew curious, and decided to watch the first few episodes. It helped that I recognized Kyoto animation\u2019s gorgeous artwork, and kept in mind my love for the Free! series, also done by Kyoani. I was hooked after episode one! Can I also just say that I love the school uniforms?\r\nThe characters are probably 50% of why I enjoyed this series so much. I resonate so much with Haruhiko as a person, and his little freak outsare unreasonably hilarious to me! Ruru is just a sassy little chatterbox, but she brings so much energy into the room, and not to mention, she's irrisitably adorable! You might not appreciate Reina and Mai that much until a bit later in the series, but they grow on you as well. I will say, however that all of the characters, including Haruhiko (who is supposed to be highly intelligent), can be ditzy at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development didn't seem to be the creators' main focus of the show, they just sort of sprinkled it here and there, but they did it just enough for me to become emotionally involved. Especially towards the end, Haruhiko really starts \"coming into his own\", as they say, and I was glad they arranged that, but it seems like they just sort of threw it in. \\n\\n\r\nI was also fascinated by the complexity of phantoms, and enjoyed seeing each different kind of phantom.\\n\\n\r\nThis series includes a few moments of ecchi, but it was by no means overdone in my opinion, and it was more comical than sexy.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also a subtle sense of harem elements in some episodes, but I enjoyed that it was all kept considerably low-key, and nobody ends up on a real date or even considering an official relationship. It really maintained the series\u2019 light-heartedness.\\n\\n\r\nKyoani has yet again produced one of my favorites!",

            "content": "Phantom World was a huge disappointment and in my eyes, the worst anime that Kyoto Ani has put out during its entire run featuring boring characters, no sense of direction or plot with its narrative and huge bouncing tits that give me PTSD of the time in which I watched the Eiken OVA.\r\nFor starters, it feels like none of the characters were made to be precisely that: characters. It feels as if their entire personality and appearance was made, with the sole purpose of being as marketable as possible to the otaku audience since none of the characters are unique in terms of design norpersonality. \\n\\n\r\nMai is the one with the big tits and she is also a potential 'love interest' for our main male protagonist. That's it. Reina is the girl who likes to swallow things whole (rather like Kirby). That's it. Koito is the reserved, cool one. That's it. Kurumi is the loli character. Guess what? That's it. Finally, we have our main character, Haruhiko, the bland self-insert who finds himself surrounded by a bunch of women, likes books and has a vast amount of knowledge to deal with any situation. Literally, every situation. It feels as if Haruhiko's only role in this show is to provide exposition and facts to the other characters in order to conveniently seize a victory against the phantom they are fighting. As a result of this, there is no tension or intrigue in any of these phantom encounters (with the exception of the last) since Haruhiko always has some kind of knowledge hidden away in order to conveniently defeat the enemy.\\n\\n\r\nWhile on the topic of exposition, there are many episodes which start off with Haruhiko talking to the audience about what the plot of the episode is going to be while telling us every idea and theme that will be related to the proceeding episode. This was not only a boring way to start off an episode as we had to sit through dull exposition but it also makes the proceeding content pointless. If we already know the plot of an episode and what themes and messages they're going to use in said episode BEFORE even watching the show, why should we care? Don't you think it would be more interesting if the audience can interpret stuff ourselves instead of having a character spell out all the plot for us as if we're damn idiots and can't think for ourselves.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is very straightforward opting for a phantom of the week structure, which would be fine if I found any of these encounters to be interesting in the slightest. Most of the phantoms they come across are unique in design but overall don't really do much or pose much a threat and instead seem to be designed with the sole purpose of revealing as much female skin as possible. Such examples include an ape-type phantom, in which they try to seduce him by painting Mai's ass red, or a phantom that changes everyone into a cat or a phantom that places censor bars over the outfits of people to make it seem as if they're wearing nothing at all. It's clearly trying to appeal to every fetish and demographics to try and rake in more viewers and make a few more extra expensive blu-ray sales.\\n\\n\r\nIt could be argued that this is all for fun and that the show is trying to be a tongue in check ecchi comedy of some sorts which I could understand if it were not for the fact that everything is so boring and just too stupid for me to even consider this notion. Most situations and story arcs were not created with the purpose of developing characters but instead were made just to appeal to as large as a group as possible. Most of the introductory episodes for the characters at least attempt to develop the characters in some way and try to give the character more depth but there is not nearly enough time devoted to each one to feel as if they have changed at all. The only time a hint of intrigue makes itself apparent in the show is near the end, which actually does a decent job at developing Haruhiko's character while also developing the relationship between the two nicely. Unfortunately, by this point, it was too little too late and the show doesn't allow enough time for all too much development past its surface level.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters and the narrative both suck, the music and the animation are the only two salvageable things out of this entire production. The music kicks ass from the opening credits to the ending and does do a good job at invoking a sense of excitement during the more action-heavy scenes. The animation is very consistent and flows very well from shot to shot with great composition and visual flow combining that with flashy colours and good fight choreography makes for a great visual experience. While the characters are speaking you can also see subtle changes in their facial expressions mid-conversation which shows the talent from both a directing standpoint and a technical standpoint too. The anime, from a technical standpoint, looks great which is why it pains me to see such great animation wasted on a mediocre cast and narrative. In my eyes, this is one of the worst anime Kyoto Ani has made and I wouldn't recommend it, even if you're looking for an ecchi show as there are better ones out there. At least Hibike Euphonium 2 is repairing the damage done to the reputation to this studio...\\n",

            "content": "Aside from Erased\u2019s score, this seems to have trousled the most bones in the Winter 2016 season, and it\u2019s hard to see why. Look, I know everyone thinks \u201cwaaahhhh kyoani is rip!!!\u201d But, come on. It can\u2019t be that bad\u2026 right\u2026? Ri--oh GOD she won a game of Limbo by bouncing her tits? WAAAHHHH KYOANI IS RIP!!!\r\nI want to feel bad for whoever originally conceived Myriad Fuck-ups Phantom World. I think the concept of this series is pretty great: some virus breaks out and causes the brain to function differently, therefore causing supernatural beings, known as \"Phantoms\", to be seen by people. Children birthed andbreastfed afterwards would then develop superpowers so that Phantoms can be fought against.\\n\\n\r\nI want to like the concept, but since Phantoms appear all the time and can have major effects, it makes me wonder what the fuck anyone did before all these super-powered kids showed up to get rid of Phantoms. Like, they say Phantoms have always been around, only no-one could see them before, but when they\u2019re able to send people to other dimensions or turn everyone within a wide radius into a fucking cat, it\u2019s a miracle that society could even develop with these buggers around. Then you have the superpowers which make little-to-no sense. Everyone birthed and breastfed after this virus just ends up with superpowers for fighting Phantoms. ...except instead of everyone having really basic and similar powers or something, characters can have very unique and specific powers, like controlling a teddy bear, fondling your own titties, or going \u201cAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nBut, whatever. Ignoring the questions regarding the concept, I still kinda like it. To make it better, the show incorporates pre-existing themes of psychology as well; most episodes will start off with the main character explaining a theory that will be demonstrated in the episode. With this, I want to believe the original author was throwing out some legitimate ideas for a story and all, but some editor/publisher came in and said \"NAH\" to a bunch of it, and made it more \"accessible\" by adding in dumb fanservice, annoying \"cutesy\" characters, and by removing any sort of plot. Now it\u2019s a true light novel! But that's just what I optimistically believe. I don't actually know how this gallery of dicks came into being.\\n\\n\r\nBut, despite having some interesting ideas, they are executed in the most boring, overused, generic, and uninteresting way possible. Instead of having a remotely interesting plot with an actual villain or drama, we get a series of episodes that each introduce some new Phantom, which the boring protagonist and his near-equally boring friends must dispose of somehow as part of their duty in their boring school. There is no plot whatsoever. Something weird will happen, and then someone will ask \u201cIs this the work of a Phantom?!\u201d like a complete fucking idiot (this happens literally every episode what the hell do they think it is), they struggle to get rid of the Phantom until they get rid of the Phantom, and then they go home and repeat the process the next day. That\u2019s the \u201cstory.\u201d Hooray.\\n\\n\r\nMusaigen seems to be action-based for the most part, but fights are actually very short and forgettable despite the great production values. The only things I actually remember are the laughable things, such as Haruhiko\u2019s somehow endearing summons (Cthulu best girl) and the chants that characters, for some reason, HAVE to use in order to use their abilities. Thank god, because this show couldn\u2019t rightfully call itself a comedy without them. (shirabeshirabeshirabeshirabeAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH) \\n\\n\r\nInstead of fighting, most situations are cleared through problem solvin\u2026\u2026\u2026erm, scratch that. No, in order to make most Phantoms go or be sealed away peacefully, the characters just go along with whatever their conundrum is or fix their life problems themselves, whether it\u2019s by participating in a really really bad play or by slapping red paint on your ass. This is what true, quality action is all about, kids. And no, I\u2019m not specifically saying that the fanservice of this show is stupid. It\u2019s just the events causing the writers to make excuses to have fanservice that are stupid.\\n\\n\r\nWhile each episode tries to add more to the characters, these efforts are pretty silly and forgettable, and anything we learn about the characters has no actual value to the \u201cnarrative\u201d. For example, Reina has some over-protective parents who don\u2019t want her fighting Phantoms for no reason at all (no, we don\u2019t actually meet her parents, but we should be grateful because this is the only character with any sort of backstory), but that conflict is resolved in an episode or two. And what do we get out of it? Nothing. Nothing changes at all. The series pretends to develop its characters, but at best they made Minase less of a cunt. That\u2019s all I got out of thirteen episodes.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cBut episodes 11-13 were so great and emotional!\u201d --that annoying voice in my head that spouts out potential arguments. They were great and emotional in the same way that Oreo changing the color of their cremes each season is great and emotional. Congrats to Nabsico for changing something and putting a little heart into it, but at the end of the day I\u2019m still getting a goddamn sandwich cookie. And that cookie is more valuable to me than this entire anime.\\n\\n\r\nI should regroup before I lose everyone here. My point is that a good episode of Myriad Colors is still Myriad Colors. It\u2019s not interesting, it\u2019s often annoying, and the characters are lame. I\u2019m afraid that it\u2019s a little too late to make me invested in the characters that you\u2019ve already taken the opportunity to establish.\\n\\n\r\nSo, who is this phenomenal cast of weridos? There\u2019s Haruhiko, your traditional high school kid who doesn\u2019t live with his parents because reasons and has no personality at all. Mai is your typical hot-headed female lead who does most of the fighting. Mai\u2019s Breasts support Mai a lot and help her fight. Reina, the only character with a backstory and a superior design, should actually be the fanservice character. Everyone likes a girl that swallows. MinAHHHHHHHse speaks for herself. Probably listens to shit music tho. There\u2019s also Ruru. \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 I\u2019d really rather not talk about this character. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I go on, has anyone seen this child? She\u2019s like five years old with lavender hair and carries a teddy bear around. Please, anyone, come claim her soon because her voice is giving me cancer, and she has no reason to be in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of this show is flat. Nothing about it stands out in any way. The OP and ED are generally the main catches of an anime, but they\u2019re passable at best. The voice acting isn\u2019t particularly bad, but Rurururiruiuriuriururiuaiuruiairuri and Kurumi have incredibly annoying voices. It doesn\u2019t help that this shithead Tinker Ruru needs to insert her opinion into literally everything that happens on the fucking screen. Can you tell that I\u2019m annoyed? I hate this character so much. If there\u2019s any saving grace, it\u2019s that Reina has the smoothest, sexiest womanly voice ever, and the noise she makes when using her power is hot. (the jokes literally write themselves with this girl)\\n\\n\r\nTo save the best for last, the art is incredible. Nothing less should be expected from Kyoto Animation, even in their bad shows. The character designs are gorgeous, but Mai wears some really weird outfit consisting of a yellow vest over a black long-sleeved shirt. It doesn\u2019t look good, and it breaks consistency, since she goes to a school and everyone but her wears the same uniform. I thought they just gave her that outfit so that Mai\u2019s Breasts could get more screentime, but then she ditches the vest and wears the normal uniform and Mai\u2019s Breasts are still perfectly visible then. Yeah, I dunno. The other thing is that the series starts off with an amazing sequence where Haruhiko is barely awake, and the world looks like a giant Tetris level for a bit because that\u2019s how brains work now. It\u2019s beautiful and had me incredibly stoked for what lied ahead, but there aren\u2019t any more great sequences like that for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, even if I wanted a little more, there still wasn\u2019t a dull moment in the visuals for me. The Phantoms have a mystical, cartoony vibe to them, and the show certainly lives up the name \u201cMyriad Colors Phantom World\u201d by being really colorful with its attacks and environments. It\u2019s hard to deny that the Gumdrop Kingdom or whatever the fuck that stupid teddy bear world was was ugly, despite its vomit-inducing sillyness. I hate kids.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s anything else to say, it\u2019s that Myriad Colors Phantom World wasn\u2019t a disaster, exactly\u2026 it wasn\u2019t \u201cso bad that it\u2019s good\u201d, and won\u2019t be considered as such\u2026 if anything, the show is just an embarrassment for the legendary Kyoto Animation. Like many series, it has potential, but just doesn\u2019t have the writing or the heart to back it up. Even the things that it actually tries to accomplish are half-hearted. \\n\\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t even watch it just for the visuals. Just go watch another KyoAni show, really.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 2/10\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nSound - 3/10\\n\r\nCharacters - 2/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 2/10\\n\r\nFanservice - pmmereinahentai/10\\n\r\nOverall - 2/10\\n\r\nFavorite character - Reina\\n\r\nFavorite episode - 12\\n\r\nRecommendation level - Very low",

Since not all Phantoms aren't good, there are groups of Phantom hunters who specialise in the sealing of these entities with their know abilities. This story follows the life of one group of Phantom hunters starting with a guy named Haruhiko Ichijou and his phantom friend Ruru, who grow by adding more members and gain more experiements throughout the series. \r\nThe anime itself was beautiful with the different choices of colours and the battlescenes showing even more use of colour. Along with the soundtrack of choice and the voice actors talent made this very enjoyable to watch. The opening song, Naked Drive was also a great choice though I did need a little warming up listening to it before actually enjoying it and same goes with the ending song too. \\n\\n\r\nWith the characters, there were a lot of moments that gave me the feeling of, here is another cliche, however, I did like them, even if I had a little crush on Reina Izumi, and allowing to connect to them made the whole series great as they all fell into their own parts for the overall story line.\\n\\n\r\nI very much enjoyed this anime and would want to buy this series on dvd when the change arises so I can go back and revisit that world. Every episode gave me a smile after the twenty odd mins of viewing time and I really hope there is a second season as it would be great to see how these characters grow up from that point.\\n",

            "content": "Let's put the negative review aside.\r\nI can say that KyoAni is trying to improve in somewhat action-oriented animation prodiction. And I found Musaigen no Phantom World to be enjoyable, of course it's really different from their earlier works, but it's a good presentation of what they're trying to do.\r\nI want to point some of the things that actually I considered to be a good change.\r\n1. Their presentation of animation style in action is actually really good. You can't deny that the characters movement while fighting is really smooth than most of action anime. Also the added effects in fight scenes might need to be brusheda bit, but they're pretty neat so far.\\n\\n\r\n2. For me, Story plot is really interesting, the world setting might be similar with most fantasy anime but this one is really refreshing, and I found every episode is pretty fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the thing that I found lacking, is.\\n\\n\r\n1. At the end of Episode, Like most anime, the ending is pretty proportional with the weight of the whole story, and I find that really predictable which made me unsatisfied. And after watching the final episode, those whole interesting story became not so interesting, because of the not-so-significant plot twist, and that's really predictable, I just know it from watching the 5th episode that there's no real plot twist, but still, it's really unsatisfiying.\\n\\n\r\n2. Those plot might be a bit inappropriate for underaged viewer, and I think they should made it clear to whom this show is being shown at. But I have no problem with how the story is being stringed up. Pretty interesting If I say so. Some people might think KyoAni confused personal fetishism with people amusement. It's okay, like as I said before, they should made it clear to whom this show is being shown at. I won't be hypocryte, I like what KyoAni did there.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, I declare Musaigen no Phantom World to be a good Anime to watch, if you're looking for amusement, and a bit interesting environment setting. Just don't ask children to watch it so seriously because.. uhm.. you know....",

Mai Kawakami is the reluctant fanservice girl of the series and LA gets why some people really like her, however LA still preferred Reina over Mai, as for Mai's development, LA saw that Mai got the best development out of the \"supposed harem\". The loner Koito Minase voiced by ''Maaya Uchida'' later on, the bear themed Kurumi Kumakura voiced by ''Misaki Kuno'' does get their own character development episodes but again like Reina falls under the harem and \"joining the cast\", finally we have Ruru voiced by ''Azusa Tadokoro'', the mascot of this anime series and is a Phantom who \"helps\" and LA says helps as loosely as possible the group, she's really just tags along than anything else until her one episode focused entirely on her. LA has been going to the basics of the characters for this review merely because the bulk of the anime is ABOUT the character interactions with each other under the \"themed\" or \"character-driven\" episode.\\n\\n\r\nOddly enough when LA said that this anime would have the cliched tired trope of \"supernatural battle harem\", it seems as if that's more of a \"place setting\" than the core focus of the anime, the core focus is developing the cast through themed episodes as well as building the world and lore of Phantoms and dealing with in wacky and hilarious ways. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation done by Kyoto Animation, well LA won't lie, their visual flair and character designs are eye candy to see and with the \"wacky\" Phantom battles are sometimes a visual spectacle, even if it is a \"supernatural battle harem\", Kyoto Ani doesn't slack, and that's one of the finer points of Musaigen no Phantom World. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending comes in as a 2 episode arc and although the build up is rather predictable, it really starts getting good by the finale episode where that loose plotline way early from anime finally gets brought up as well as a small plot twist that actually made the finale well worth the wait to watch. \\n\\n\r\nMusaigen no Phantom World may fall under the \"supernatural battle harem\" cliches however due to it's focused episodic format where they develop both the main cast but the world and lore of where Phantoms and humans interact with each other it's more of a slice of life battle harem with both huge expositionary moments from Haruhiko and some of it's anime genre tropes flipped for better or worse...but mainly for the better.",

            "content": "Considering we're talking about Musaigen no Phantom World, I want to give my own piece of my mind about this series. Of course, there's been a lot of talking about this for my experience, from MAL forums towards Facebook, some YouTubers, etc. It's kind of the say that it's a show that I wanted to rather share a thought rather than reviewing it, but considering I'm writing in the review section I might as well give myself a thought of the spectrum.\r\nMusaigen no Phantom World has been one of those shows that (maybe) many people were looking forward to, mainly because of the well-known animestudio also known as Kyoto Animation, which they're famous for their shows such as K-On!, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Hibike! Euphonium, CLANNAD, etc. They're known for having also a good track record around the market, but a little bit of their lineups aren't very impressive (example Kyoukai no Kanata, Air). While I do have to agree that Musaigen no Phantom World didn't live up into the expectation level of Kyoto Animation, I kind of think that at the same time many people are giving a kick into the butt on the show because it's one of those... *ahem*\\n\\n\r\n\"Stereotypical Light Novel Adaptations.\"\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Musaigen no Phantom World falls into that medium, its source material is based off of the Light Novel of the same name, which quite frankly it's not really a bad thing considering from what I've seen from the anime in itself, it's really ain't bad. But at the same time I don't think the series wasn't good either, or anything amazing.\\n\\n\r\nLet me explain what I mean by this with the show.\\n\\n\r\nBasically the series has more of a character focus route more than the story focus, while it isn't bad per say it would technically degrade the show's quality of story telling. The story telling in the series can defined as:\\n\\n\r\nCliche\\n\r\nGeneric\\n\r\nand of course, Unoriginal.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a thing that maybe turns people off and steady because not all people would want something like this. Many people would want something rather refreshing or new, or something that ticks off the notch. Well, originality doesn't exist, but what does Musaigen no Phantom World even do to make it seem rather tolerable for me or at least decent?\\n\\n\r\nWell, it's pretty simple.\\n\\n\r\nThe show isn't really trying to be anything special or amazing, but then it seems like Kyoto Animation is implementing their style to it, in order to be more entertaining and fun. For example per each character arc they add some little bit of their specialty, which is the execution of the drama in itself. It seems rather nice and refreshing to get a little bit of a Kyoto Animation feel like their previous shows. They really nail in that spectrum and specialty, especially in one of the arcs (I think Reina's story) was rather one of the best episodes the series has in stock. \\n\\n\r\nAlso it seems like Phantom World knows how to give characters some screentime without leaving them out of the picture, and I mean the main cast. They get at least a decent amount of characterization throughout the series and while they're kind of strayed away a bit from the archetypes. Also, Kyoto Animation knows how to give a charm towards these characters, since that's of course their type of thing in the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodic nature of the show would be rather repetitive per say because, we're getting these characters doing the daily routine and trying to capture these Phantoms. The story is weak in that standard because meanwhile each episode its its own thing, it doesn't do well with fleshing out the story at all, or at least, they're not trying to do so.\\n\\n\r\nFor the comedy department I'd say it's a hit or miss for people. Technically speaking its kind of your cliches but at the same times these cliche moments have this little charm to it that makes it quite tolerable, it's hard to explain but, I take it like some other shows from this area as well.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art and animation, it seems quite well done as usual for the studio. They made the series rather bright and colorful, using different types of textures with the hair color tips and the designs as well to stand out from your other character designs. The cinematography in this series is rather beautifully done as well, they do give as usual, effort in trying to make the series look good and flow with motion and livelyhood. That I will appreciate it the most.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack I'd say... well, not forgettable, but more like it's not really anything unique or spectacular. I do agree that the OST fits with said scenarios and that's pretty cool. But I don't really get the full grasp on it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, they're nice and well preformed, at least as far as I'm concerned with the tone and the proper timing these actors use. It makes these characters fun and entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThe Opening has a rather modern tech and jumpy beat for at least most part, it gets me really pumped for the later episodes and of course its fine and dandy. Actually it's on my top 10 favorite Openings of the season.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Ending... Ehh... not so much to say about this one, but its pretty cute, I'll say that.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment/Perspective:\\n\\n\r\nHonestly I can get why people were disappointed for Phantom World. I won't deny that its kind of lackluster compared to their other works, but I personally think people are being a tad bit too harsh on it. Why? I don't really think it's doing anything bad, It's just the story has the weakest approach around for my eyes, and while it's the weakest, I personally think it can be tolerable enough.\\n\\n\r\nI also think that people were expecting too much about Phantom World, and that's because of the studio in itself. I mean heck, I wasn't expecting that much at the beginning, and I still think its quite a fun watch regardless of it. In comparison to other shows that aired in the same season, THAT DID FAR WORSE and failed epically, Phantom World is one of those series that it's rather doing nothing special, but having still their Kyoto Touch.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, if you want a show to pass the time and have fun, I would highly recommend this if you want to give it a try. But, if you're looking for something rather with a big story telling or \"stand-out\" direction from the studio, please go and watch something else. You would be disappointed in the end.\\n",

            "content": "Why KyoAni? (Spoilers) \r\nStory: 5/10\r\nMusaigen no Phantom World has that generic concept that teenagers doing some magic and going to school bla bla... But in noragami style! Let me explain, teenagers that have some superpowers are hunting imaginary things called phantoms. Some of them dangerous creatures, some of them limbo dancing telephone poles, some of them pervert UFOs... Interesting, right? But actually nothing happened. It's an episodic anime so most of the people hates it (and the fanservice) but I don't care if it's episodic or not. I liked some episodic animes before (OPM, Joukamachi no Dandelion...), so for me the important parts are charactersand enjoyment. I even liked the plots of the episodes, 11th and 12th episodes were really good. Some drama, some character developments, some serious and ''2 episodic'' plot and BAM! I thought finally my hopes came true, it made me say ''Wow, that anime is getting some good points.'' BUT then, the final episode happened. I was so hopefull for this episode, I waited like serious plottwist, but what I got was action, forced fanservice and an actually no sense plot. That Ruru-Haruhiko thing was stupid and they actually kissed? Sorry but this is forced and bad fanservice. If they made a great final, I would even give 7/10 for story. But the thing I loved is that Haruhiko gives some information about something at every episode's begining and it's the plot of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nKyoAni is gorgeous again. KyoAni has my favourite style of character designs and that animations are awesome, even Reina's swallowing power.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAt first I didn't like the OP song but now it's so catchy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are of course loveable, even they're a little cliche. Kyo Ani usually focuses on the characters and they did it again. There is at least one episode that focuses on one character and that character's development. I loved Mai, Reina and Ruru's development but I can't say it for Koito. And sorry Reina, Mai is still the best girl.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is entertaining. I don't know if you're enjoying this series but I am definetly enjoying. Some people say it has too much fanservice but I think it's not. Uhm, maybe some episodes tho... But generally there wasn't over fanservice, and it wasn't harem either. I wanted MaixHaruhiko but it didn't happen. Maybe more romance could make this anime better. We know Kyo Ani is how good at comedy, romance and drama. And yeah the anime was generally full of comedy but every episode's ending has a little drama. Especially last episodes made the drama good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, I actually liked this anime but again it could be a lot better. Especially the story...",

            "content": "The human brain is possibly the most complex biological entity on planet Earth. It evolved over millions of years into something capable of not only surviving despite having no physical advantage over our predators but also into something capable of deciphering the numerous secrets of the universe.\r\nWhen an anime tries to tackle something as complex as the human psyche you would think it\u2019s an anime with a serious tone and serious characters. Well, not necessarily, today I am taking a look at the Winter 2016 anime which revolves around the human brain: Musaigen no Phantom World or Myriad Colours Phantom World in English.\r\nPlot and characters\r\nTheplot of Musaigen no Phantom World revolves around a group of students living in a world in which all sorts of monsters and fairy tale characters run wild. The world being in this state is the result of  an accident at a research facility which modified the brain of every human around the world.\\n\r\nThe main characters of the show, as I\u2019ve mentioned are a group of students who are all members of the Neural Error Corrections Club; a club in which all the members have superpowers which they use to deal with evil monsters or Phantoms as the show calls them.\\n\\n\r\nOur male lead is the smart but clueless and at times useless Ichijo Haruhiko. He has the power  to seal away all the evil Phantoms and along with his teammate Kawakami Mai, who utilizes elemental powers, forms the weakest group in the club. There\u2019s not a lot to say about Haruhiko\u2019s personality he is honestly pretty empy personality wise. The more notable things are his ability to create a harem and his issues concerning his parents which become important towards the end of the series. Other than that he is just there so that the audience can project on to him. He is never directly involved in fights, most of the time being relegated to just sucking up the enemies into his book or summoning other Phantoms to fight for him.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve mentioned her earlier but our main female lead is Kawakami Mai. She is also the poster girl for this anime. Mai is an athletic tomboy who has been friends with Haruhiko for a while before the series begins. Now, you\u2019d think that because she is the poster girl for the series she would get a lot of backstory and screentime.  Nope, she is instead given the task of providing as much fanservice as possible with some sexy moves for when she uses an ability and even a scene where Haruhiko paints her butt. Once again, her character also fall short because of the lack of development.\\n\r\nOh, and there\u2019s also that frankly annoying Ruru who is Haruhiko\u2019s childhood friend Phantom and the shows main source of terrible comic relief. She is a special Phantom who doesn\u2019t want to harm humans and is actually really friendly. She is sort of like Na\u2019Vi, tries to be helpful but ends up being more of a nuisance. She suddenly becomes really important at the end of the show which comes out of the blue considering that she\u2019s basically done nothing up until that point except for messing things up a lot.\\n\\n\r\nWe also have some characters who join the main cast after a \u201cquest\u201d has been performed for them. These characters are: the cheerful and shy Izumi Reina, the quiet and mysterious Minase Koito, and the \u201conly exists because we need a loli\u201d Kumamakura Kurumi. All of which suffer from the same problems as our original dynamic duo. With them getting 1 or 2 episodes of character development before being assigned a role and an archetype and then being pushed to the side.\\n\r\nThe anime is episodic in nature with only the last 2 episodes being connected by a common plot thread. Almost everything is reset to the status-quo at the end of each episode which makes one episode in particular totally pointless and skipable, coincidentaly this episode is also the hot springs episode of the series.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk a bit about the ecchi aspect of the series. I generally find that there is nothing wrong with having some fanservice in a show as long as it doesn\u2019t sacrifice plot just to show me some boobs. This show however takes it\u2019s already non-existing plot and puts some ecchi in it; some very painful ecchi scenes which give me flashbacks to Heavy Object. It\u2019s like they are afraid to put the ecchi in so they half-ass it and somehow make it more in-your-face than it would normally be and also painful to watch at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodic nature of the series combined with the characters being uninteresting and unchanging for the most part is what ruins what could have been a good show. But alas, it is as my history teacher used to say \u201cHistory is what has happened, not what could have happened.\u201d\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Animation\\n\r\nThis is really where the series shines.  Kyoto Animation is the studio behind the animation for this work. I don\u2019t think I exaggerate when I say that this is one of the most beautiful shows ever created. The screen is filled with vibrant colours and the animations are fantastic. Almost feels like this anime had a movie budget for each and every episode. The opening animation, especially is one of the best looking openings I have seen in recent memory. I could go on praising the animation of this series for quite a while so I\u2019m just going to stop myself there.\\n\\n\r\nNow, concerning the sound design of the anime I can\u2019t really praise it that much. Sure, both the opening and ending songs are fun to listen to and there is nothing wrong with the tracks that play during the anime. There\u2019s also nothing praiseworthy, nothing that sticks out and no song that I want to listen to even after the anime is over.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict\\n\\n\r\nWasted potential is what I would call Phantom world. It brings an interesting concept and good looking animation but messes up in the story department. There\u2019s some enjoyment to be had with this show particularly if you like vibrant colours and/or softcore ecchi scenes. At the end of the day, I wish they would have focused more on the plot of the series rather than the art and fanservice. Sadly, because of the poor decisions of its creators I\u2019m giving this show a failing grade. At first I really hoped this show would pull itself together and give us something good. I wanted it to be good. But by the time episode 8 rolled around (the hot springs episode) it was obvious that the show wouldn\u2019t be saveable anymore. And so, my final score for this anime is a 4/10.\\n",

Now I don'tmind Fanservice or Ecchi in Anime, but the way Phantom World do it just makes me to watch Hentai tbh. And also the Fight in Episode and 6 feels very Lazy tbh tho, but other than that it was very fun and Watchable as well tho. I really did like the Neko Episode even know it wasn't the Best but it was good and Watchable at least.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow the Characters in here are so Unique with their Supernatural Abilities and Moe Designed as well tho.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHaruhiko, A Highschool Student that have the Power to Summon \"Weak\" Creatures (kinda like a Pokemon Trainer tbh tho.), But Tbh he's very awesome tho, great at Drawing and A Cool Harem. He's not on my Top 10 Favorite Characters tho but he's at least on my Top 15 tbh.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMai, She's The Best Girl in this Anime if you ask me tbh. Sure Her Powers are Sexual but Unique as well tbh, She's very nice After Episode 10, and I just like Her Designed as well tho. Anyways She Just your Highschool Student that Needs to Beat Monster in other to get Money tho. Also She's very Badass as well tho.\\n\\n\\n\r\nReina, Well, she's really cute tbh tho. She can Eat almost every Type of Phantom out there. And she's kinda of a Tsundere but not one of those who ignores the heck out of you tbh tho.\\n\\n\r\nKoito, A Shy Girl who always Hangout with Haruhiko and the Others tho. She have the Powers of how to put it... Sonic Boom?.. Sound Boom?..... You get my point, once she Scream she unleashed a Sonic Wave.

She's very cool and unique tbh tho.\\n\\n\r\nEnigma, I'm not going to Spoil her that much but all I'm going to say is that she's the Main Villain of this Show and She's very Badass as well tbh.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation It's Animated by KyoAni so I did Expect Colourful and Moe Animation. What I didn't really Expect was the Epic Fights!!! Sure I say That in Episode 5 and 6 The Fights are Lazy but that's just Episode 5 and 6, other than that is Amazing tbh tho.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack/OST Is very great tbh. The Opening is Very Catchy as well tho. The OST can be sometimes Epic or Peaceful. For me it was really cool tbh.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Results:8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis my Friends, is what The Monogatari Series Should've it been. An Anime with Great Fights, Beautiful Animation, Catchy Soundtracks, Watchable for everyone, and with no Dialogue Heavy!!! And I did also like the Concept tho, it have kinda of the same Concept as The Monogatari Series but with No Boring Dialogue Heavy and More Epic Fights, witch is Awesome!!!! Sure it have some Problems like They Take The Sexuality To The Next Level and some of The Fights can Be Lazy at times (like in Episode 5 and 6 for example tho.) but is really good if you're looking for an Action Ecchi tho.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u2714Great Fights\\n\r\n\u2714Beautiful Animation By KyoAni\\n\r\n\u2714Great OST\\n\r\n\u2714Watchable\\n\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\\n\r\n\ud83d\udca2Too Much Sexuality.\\n\r\n\ud83d\udca2Lazy Fights on Episode 5 and 6.\\n\\n\r\nHope this Helps alright guys.\\n\\n\r\n-Adriel The Anime Smash Bros.",

Well take a look here to find out.\r\nPros\r\n- ABSOLUTE STUNNING ANIMATION (Kyoto Ani are Gods)\r\n- Good OST\r\n- Interesting Characters (All the girls at least)\r\n- Use of Ecchi (Pool episode was hilarious)\r\n- Amazing Action scenes\r\nCons\r\n- No plot whatsoever, Mystery of Week. (Some people won't mind this but I'm not one of those people \u0ca0_\u0ca0 )\r\n- Boring and uninteresting Male protaganist. (This is from the same studio that gave us GODLIKE MC's like Kanie from \"Amagi Brillliant Park\" and Houtarou from \"Hyouka\")\r\n- Use of Ecchi (Some ofit might not be to everyones liking. Some of Mai's ecchi was just dumb especially the limbo scene)\\n\r\n- RURURURRURUR is annoying.\\n\r\n- Forgettable side characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Phantom World had its moments but it was inconsistent with me. With no plot, I found I was forcing myself to watch each episode. A lot of the jokes weren't funny. Shout out to the pool episode, it was the only episode that I enjoyed. I think this show needed 24 episodes because after reading LN, some big I MEAN BIG stuff gets revealed which would have earned respect from me for this show. But, alas this is what we got.

            "content": "Musaigen no Phantom World (aka Musaigen) was pretty much universally hated for some reason, even acheiving the great status of being the worst rated KyoAni show on MAL. Which is a shame, because it wasn't that bad at all. \r\nMusaigen is about a kid (Haruhiko) who knows a lot of useless info but is pretty weak physically, along with his side kicks (who are all female). They all have special powers and are able to see figments of human imagination, which can affect physical objects and living things after an accident with a company that was researching them. These special powers vary in power, andwhile he doesn't have a particularly powerful power it's above average, and they go around 'sealing' these 'Phantoms' before they become a big menace.\\n\\n\r\nThis is pretty much the entire series. They are part of a school club that rewards them for taking care of middle level to easy phantoms, and they get to earn some pocket money while helping out the police (who take care of the stronger phantoms). Each episode usualy deals with one phantom somehow messing with either the characters, or someone else who they help as part of their 'job'. Which isn't very bad at all, since it does this pretty well. There are episodes centered around each character, there's a decent amount of character development (for 13 episodes) and you grow to like most of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nGiven that there is one male main and 4 female main characters (5 if you count their weird mini fairy sidekick) there's a fair amount of fanservice. Which is usually ok, it's not too excessive, but sometimes can get annoying. An example would be the first episode, which was part of why everyone everywhere decided it was utter shit, and was sort of unfortunate for the series.\\n\\n\r\nBeing episodic, it still had an 'overarching story' during these, where they mention a few things that happened in past episodes and was hinted to be part of a wider plot. This culminates in the final episodes, provding sort of a story end for the series as a whole, and at least concludes it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very, very good. The designs were pretty decent, but what shines the most was the art for the special powers, which looked great. Explosions, energy waves, heck, even energy swrods were handled very well. Sound was pretty decent as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe main thing pulling the series down is simply its attempt at a final story and attempts at character building. The ending was sort of clich\u00e9 and honestly not very well done, and for a cast of 6 characters, there simply weren't enough episodes to flesh them all out, leading to all of them getting some development. Other than that the anime wasn't very bad at all; some parts were mediocre, some good, but overall it was a very decent series.\\n\\n\r\nMusaigen wasn't a very bad series at all, just had a lot of tropes and clich\u00e9s used before thrown in that seemed repetitive to the viewer who watches this sort of anime by the dozen. Ignoring the high hopes people apparently pin to KyoAni, this show wasn't by any means a masterpiece, but was still a fun watch.",

            "content": "Musaigen no Phantom World is another anime from the great Kyoto Animation, So does the great Kyoto Animation finally made a good anime again with this title ? No. This anime one of the most bland anime i have ever seen, its not bad but there's nothing special at all with this anime.\r\nThe story itself is all over the place, i cannot found any main plot that drive the anime along. It just filled with a tiny plot every episodes that didn't really effect other episodes. The worse thing is, they tease a mystery with a device that the main characters found in one ofthe episodes, but in the end that devices still didn't really make an impact at all in any of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episodes feels like a bullet points in a presentation. Every characters get their own \"character development\" episodes, a lot of anime do this too but the character usually keep developing even after they get their \"character development\" episodes. The \"character development\" episodes its just a way to introduce the personality of the characters to the audience. But in this anime, after they get the \"character development\" episodes, its like the anime forgot about their personality and they just change them just to fit the situation that the creator wants them to be in. For example, there's a character that is really reclusive suddenly trying to be seductive. It all just feel really unnatural and strange to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scene is decent, nothing to write home about and not that bad either. A lot of fights ended really quick and not epic at all. The main characters will get defeated once, after that with some luck and a really powerful combo they defeated the enemy, rinse and repeat. Even the ending battle use this formula. In the end, nearly all the fight scene feels a little dull to be watched. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is hit and miss, even though mostly miss. There's only a few comedy scene that makes me smile, not laugh. Smile. The rest its just a dull and cringe worthy moment for me. There's also some ecchi scene for the first 3 or 4 episodes, after that the anime just go to a totally different direction all together and abandon all the ecchi scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent, the character design and the monster design is good enough and feels like it was made by a AAA production studio. The background music is either really bland or non existent at all, since i honestly  can't remember which scene that have background music. The only truly great thing that i can say the voices for Kurumi Kumamakura is really cute.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Musaigen no Phantom World is a bland anime that didn't really know the direction that they want to go, so they decided to go everywhere and try everything that they can. If they didn't know the direction to go, how can the audience know how to follow it ? Is it worth your time ? No. There's a lot greater anime with similar plot that is better than this anime.",

            "content": "You know, if this was done by another studio, I would have dropped this show in an instant. Since this was made by Kyoto Animation and I admit, I'm a big KyoAni fag.....I mean fan, I decided to watch all 13 episodes. After 13 weeks of watching this show, I'd like to send a personal note to the studio and it's going to say something like this:\r\n\"What in God's name happened to you KyoAni?!!\" \r\n[Story]: (2/10)\r\n\"You can't believe everything you see, or can't see, for that matter.\"\r\nPhantoms, beings that blur the line between illusion and reality, wander around right under the noses of unsuspecting humans.Their origins are mysterious and few can see them. That is, until a research facility bombing spreads a virus that gave \"birth\" to what we now know as \"Phantoms\". Humans with special powers are given the task of sealing the trouble-making Phantoms.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, when I first read the synopsis, I thought KyoAni would finally produce a dark and serious anime. But alas, Phantom World teaches me to never hope for a serious and dark story from Kyoto Animation. I just gotta accept the fact that the last dark and serious story that I'll ever get from that studio is \"The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya\" which remains to be their best work the studio has ever done.\\n\\n\r\nWelp, time to review the story.....Wait a minute? Reviewing Phantom World's story? What story? The synopsis led me to believe that Phantom world will at least have an exciting story but this show doesn't even have a single ounce of story. Phantom World is basically an episodic show. Each episode, a Phantom stirs trouble and Haruhiro and the girls (or one of the girls alone Haruhiro) will take down the Phantom and save the day. That's what literally happened in Ep. 1 - 11. The first half of the series are just a bunch of character introductions. We get to see their personalities, their abilities and what you should expect from these characters. In the second half, it's pretty much what I said above. Phantom causes trouble and the characters take down the Phantoms. \\n\\n\r\nFrom Ep. 12-13, we finally get a mini story arc that was actually serious and has an actual antagonist explaining why he/she is doing whatever the hell he/she is doing to the city and it got something to do with the synopsis' first paragraph. The short story arc was actually pretty good. It had an actual story, even though the story was short and the characters were suddenly serious and not annoying, Hell, even Ruru wasn't annoying. Too bad this wasn't enough to save the show. \\n\\n\r\nThere is an explanation as to why the majority of the series was like a slice-of-life and Ep 12 suddenly introduced a serious story. Appearantly, it isn't until Volume 2 where the story turns dark and serious and majority of the show is adapted from Volume 1 which explains the slice-of-life aspect of the series. If this was a 2 cour series then Phantom World would turn out a lot better. \\n\\n\r\nRanting aside, I did enjoy the show. How did I enjoy this show you ask? Simple, I switched my perspective when I realized that Phantom World will not have a story arc and will instead, be a random episodic show. Since I also watch a lot of slice of life shows, I looked at this show from a SoL viewpoint and I ended up enjoying the show much more than I expected. The comedy aspect is there and the characters are surprisingly enjoyable to watch. This show was basically a time-killer for me. A show where I can turn my brain off and relax. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (10/10)\\n\r\nAs usual, Kyoto Animation produces one of the best animation in the industry. Great art, Great character designs, the lighting is amazing, the background is well-drawn, and the animation is very smooth and consistent. Just think of Hibike Euphonium except the character's faces aren't blushing all the time. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (10/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was simply amazing!! Kyoto Animation did a shitty job on Phantom World's \"non-existent\" storyline but on the other hand, they did an outstanding job on the show's Battle scene's OST.  Especially that battle theme that plays when the characters are about to do their special moves. I wish I could post a video where the battle theme is playing because explaining it won't do justice to the show's soundtrack. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"Naked Dive\" by SCREEN mode and the ED theme song is \"Junshin Always\" by Azusa Tadokoro. Ever since I heard the OP theme song, I've been listening to it non-spot because it's catchy as hell and there was that one scene in the OP Animation where the loli was dancing while holding her teddy bear in the cutest way possible. I'm not a lolicon but I have to admit, the loli dancing caught my.........heart. I also love the ED theme song because it's catchy and the singer's voice is beautiful. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (6.5/10)\\n\r\nHaha, man..KyoAni managed to put every cliched and cute characters that you could ever think of in a single show. There's a generic male protagonist, a big-boobed senpai, a flat chested girl, a girl who has trouble socializing, a fu**king loli, an annoying fairy and a friendly/helpful teacher. The only logical reason why you and I watched this show in the first place (and somehow enjoyed it) is the characters. All the girls are cute, they all have a set of unique and cliched personalities that we have all seen before a million times but for whatever reason, we just keep coming back because we enjoy seeing these personalities (if they're done right) and the characters are hilarious when they're all together. Now, my thoughts on the main characters. \\n\\n\r\nFirst up, we have \"Mai Kawakami\" or what I'd like to call her \"Mayonnaise-sama\". I wouldn't be surprised if we get a mouse pad with a picture of Mai and her boobs used as a wrist support to satisfy all those horny Japanese males. Like her breasts are big as hell so you'll be seeing them bouncing all the time throughout the show even if you try to avoid looking. If you want to learn \"Boob Physics 101\", do watch the \"Limbo scene\" at the first episode because I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Her appearance aside, she's a complete tsundere and she does get a bit of character development at the late latter half of the show. Also, to no surprise, she gains feelings for the protagonist, though she didn't gain feelings for him randomly. A cute big-boobed tsundere = 100% \"pure\" waifu material. \\n\\n\r\nNext up, we have \"Reina Izumi\". A flat-chested innocent girl who eats a lot of food but for whatever reason, she just doesn't gain any weight. Her ability is to literally suck up the Phantoms and that explains why she eats an abundance amount of food. Reina-chan is actually my most favourite character in the series simply because she's a flat-chested innocent girl who eats a lot of food. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's \"Koito Minase\" or what I'd like to call her \"Headphone-chan\". Headphone-chan is basically one of those emo girls who brushes off other people and prefers to not socialize. Honestly, she's the most boring character in the series and if you prefer anti-social girl types then you found her. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's \"Kurumi\", a loli that serves no goddamn purpose in the show whatsoever. I mean, why does she, an elementary schooler, hang around with a bunch of high school students? What purpose does she serve within the group or the show? Honestly, I feel like her only purpose in the show is to satisfy the pedophiles and to back up what I just said, Kurumi is an anime-original character and she does not exist in the LN's.........Yep.....\\n\r\nWell, that and to show us that she ain't a \"useless\" kid. She has that \"Albrecht(o)\" bear that fights alongside her and also to make her even more cuter. Nah, I lied..she's a useless kid. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, there's the protagonist Haruhiko and that fairy girl that hangs around him all the time \"Ruru\". Haruhiko is like the weakest protagonist I've ever seen. The only time that he's ever strong is if he has that booklet or that final fight scene at the end of the series. Did I also tell you that he's also a generic protagonist? Oh right, I already did.. Ruru, on the other hand, is a likable character for me. Some, if not most, people might find her annoying but not me. I find her hilarious and there was that one episode in the late 2nd half that made her somewhat of a better character.\\n\\n\r\nIn the first half, each episode was dedicated to Haruhiko and at least one of the female characters. For example, Haruhiko and Mai and the next episode, it's Haruhiko and Reina and etc. This basically gave the show a chance to give them a bit of character development. It's not much though. It's just basics like you learn why Koito is an anti-social or why Reina is acting the way she is. The 2nd half also developed Haruhiko and Mai's character but again, not that much. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (7.8/10)\\n\r\nEven though the story was pretty much non-existent, I still enjoyed the show. Phantom World was more of a \"turn your brain off\" kind of anime for me and also a time killer. I just didn't take it seriously and at the end, I wasn't as mad at the show as I was expecting to be.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"Myriad Colors Phantom World\" may have been an enjoyable anime to me but I'm disappointed to say that this is now Kyoto Animation's worst anime ever. The story was basically non-existent and the only aspect this show has its going is it's characters and the animation/soundtracks. Though, the characters will vary because not everyone will enjoy the characters like I did. If you look at this show from a slice-of-life point of view then you might enjoy this series. However, if you're expecting a serious story similar to the synopsis then it's better if you skip this show.     \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (6.8/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Enjoyable series when you look at it from a slice-of-life point of view\\n\r\n+Outstanding Animation\\n\r\n+Amazing Soundtrack + Great OP and ED theme songs\\n\r\n+All of the character may be cliched as hell but they're still enjoyable to watch\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Non-Existent Storyline\\n\r\n-A lot of Fanservice scenes and that Limbo Scene\\n\r\n-Too Much Mai Boobs\\n\r\n-Kurumi serves no purpose in the show other than to satisfy the pedophiles\\n\r\n-A bit of character development but there's not a lot\\n",

            "content": "Over the past few years, I have been a witness to the slow death of KyoAni. First came Chuu2, a middling but otherwise inoffensive rom-com. Then came Kyoukai no Kanata, an absolute disaster of writing, and the creaking of KyoAni's creative efforts could start to be heard. And now, several more mediocre series later, we have Musaigen no Phantom World, a title so vapid and effortless that I believe KyoAni has finally reached the point of being irredeemable. KyoAni is dead. It is dead, and it's not coming back.\r\nIf not for the KyoAni name\u2014now worthless\u2014 nobody would have cared about what Phantom World has tooffer. It is your typical, uninspired rom-com that we get in the dozens every single year. There is nothing you have not seen here before, and nothing to inspire a viewing aside from the fact that it 'looks and sounds nice'. They stayed KyoAni on the outside, but on the inside they are merely a shallow, rotting husk of what they used to be.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not even worth the time to discuss the art of Phantom World. Anyone who has seen even a single KyoAni anime knows exactly what they're getting here. Their art no longer impresses me. I am also getting tired of forgiving their shows' terrible plots and characters just because they happen to look pretty. If all they are now capable of is drawing cute characters and flashy OPs and EDs, then perhaps they should leave anime and go work on manga and TV commercials instead?\\n\\n\r\nKyoAni seems to have forgotten what made previous titles like K-ON and Haruhi so successful: characters. There is not a character within the show who is developed in any meaningful way, and only one\u2014Kurumi\u2014 is even worth a damn, and that's not just because I love twintails and wish to be surrounded by twintailed beauties for the rest of my days. Kurumi is the only one who actually feels like a person and not just an assortment of tropes slapped together ('cool', 'big boobs', 'tsundere'). She acts remarkably her age; her seiyuu even goes as far as to stutter and poorly enunciate her words, as a girl in primary school would. Minase? I had to look through the character listing to even remember her name. \\n\\n\r\nPhantom World has another one of those 'dumb male friend' characters, similar to Ishiki from Chuu2, but manages to do so little with him that you forget he even exists. Not only is he a waste of space like just about every character in this show, but it is real tiring seeing all these pseudo-harem anime incapable of making a second male character who is actually a competent person and not just background fodder or some dumb, running gag. \\n\\n\r\nRuru, the show's mascot character, clearly exists only to sell merchandise and figures. Unlike, say, Tamako Market's Dera-chan, who was actually a unique and amusing character, the little fairy here is nothing but an annoyance. Her small size is quite fitting, being little more than a fly buzzing around in the protagonist's and the viewer's faces. It is also quite pathetic how the show attempts to make us care for her suddenly, the protagonist stretching his hand out towards the sky and screaming! Tears! Drama! Give me a break.\\n\\n\r\nPhantom World regularly treats its audience like it is a mass of buffoons who have never been to school. It uses\u2014you guessed it\u2014 Schrodinger's Cat in a vain attempt to seem more philosophical and meaningful than it actually is. Yes, we know what Schrodinger's Cat is. We are not idiots. It does not need to be explained to us for the umpteenth time in anime. The show even goes as far as to explain what a trojan horse is, as if we know absolutely nothing about the world and have been sitting on our mommy's lap sucking our thumb since the day we were born.\\n\\n\r\nNot only does Phantom World pull the awful transfer student trope, but the character is literally accepted into the school within hours of attaining their 'human form', and they do so without any form of identification or previous educational experience that would, you know, be necessary in a school transfer? It is true that the series is not attempting to be perfectly realistic, but if it wants to use the high school setting then at the very least it should actually try to have its high school resemble a high school. \\n\\n\r\nNothing interesting is done with the premise, aside from, say, creating excuses for nonsense like all the characters suddenly turning into cats. I'm sorry, but giving the girls cat ears and tail and making them end all their sentences with \"nyan\" does not do anything to improve the quality of the show. I enjoy cuteness in anime quite a bit, but the least KyoAni could do is try to make it more natural and less artificial, less like they are writing and structuring the anime by checking off boxes for everything that has ever been considered 'cute'. I half-expected there to be an episode where everyone starts calling the protagonist \"onii-chan\".\\n\\n\r\nThere are regular doses of fanservice, in scenes such as the main heroine, Mai, doing the limbo dance, her boobs jiggling and bouncing all over the place for the viewer's apparent satisfaction. Fanservice as a whole really needs to go away from anime, at least as far as its sexual incarnation is concerned. There exist hentai, doujins, eroge and other forms of pornography for a reason. If I wanted to feel aroused, I would watch or read one of the above-mentioned media\u2014they do it far better. I do not come to anime to see butts and panties and girls being licked by slimy monster tongues as if I am a child who does not know what porn or sex actually is. I love sexy things about as much as I love the story-driven stuff, but the two really need to not mix unless it is absolutely necessary. I can count on one hand the times an anime has been able to pull that off successfully. \\n\\n\r\nAt least Kyoukai no Kanata, as poorly-written as it was, could be given the slightest bit of credit for trying. Phantom World doesn't even do that much. It is as if KyoAni has accepted that their best days are forever behind them, and have now resigned themselves solely to producing lifeless, mediocre rubbish that will be forgotten after a month's time. Even producing something completely middling like Chuu2 now seems to be beyond their reach. Their in-house writers are so incompetent that they may as well just go back to adapting visual novels again; they've clearly demonstrated how incapable they are of doing anything themselves.\\n\\n\r\nPeople will still watch Phantom World because it is made by KyoAni. There are many people who still hold fond memories of the anime KyoAni used to make, and there are those who have only just started watching their more successful titles and do not yet know what the KyoAni of today is like. These fans are being manipulated and lured into watching a bad anime merely because it looks and sounds like a KyoAni title, and not because it is actually a worthwhile story on its own merits. It is a husk. Shiny it may be, but empty it is and will ever be. A sad sight indeed. \\n\\n\r\nBut the anime industry is a big place, and it will live on regardless, even if one of its most influential studios has withered away. Anime doesn't need KyoAni anymore. It's time to move on. I already have.",

What do I mean by that? Well, let us begin the lecture! Take notes, young lads!\r\nHigh school setting? \r\nLight novel adaptation? \r\nMain character is a male, and the only male? \r\nMain character is also pretty darn useless? \r\nHarem of girls with different tropes? \r\nOne has big boobies? \r\nOne is flat? \r\nOne is a loli? \r\nAccidental fan service? \r\nBy Kyoto Animation? \r\nSee what I mean? This show is full of cliches! In fact, it's a bit too cliche. But the thing is, itisn't a bad show! One thing for sure is that it can get very entertaining! The animation and art is incredibly high quality, the soundtrack is also good, and the waifus are adorable! Sure, it's got no substance in terms of plot and whatnot, but really, waifus are the only reason you need to watch this show. \\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n- Beautiful art and animation! A really great show to look at!\\n\r\n- OP is catchy and the soundtrack is good too! A great show to listen to!\\n\r\n- You get a waifu, he gets a waifu, she gets a waifu, everybody gets a waifu!\\n\r\n- Characters, albeit not developed or original in any sense, are still very likable!\\n\r\n- Entertaining action and jokes!\\n\r\n- Fanservice ;)\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- What is a story?\\n\r\n- What is character development?\\n\r\n- Generic as balls!\\n\r\n- Pretty boring MC.\\n\r\n- Fanservice ;-;\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nHmmm, is this even a story? Musaigen no Phantom World's story is all over the place, and by that, I mean it's absolutely nowhere. It's basically episodic, with each episode dealing with a different phantom or situation that has absolutely nothing to do with any of the other situations the characters faced. Any explanations throughout the story are undetailed or forced, the stakes aren't high at all, characters come and go on a whim, and yeah, it's basically just a really messy story. But some episodes do redeem this story from being a one, as some of them are actually pretty touching or funny! Either way, don't watch this show expecting a Shinsekai Yori tier story. Nah, don't do that.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nTake my money, Kyoto Animation, take my damn money, for Musaigen no Phantom World has some really high quality art and animation! In fact, the only reason it isn't a 10 is because it gets lazy sometimes. The action scenes are like borderline ufotable, and the character designs are so damn colorful and crisp to the maximum! Sometimes I feel like I'm watching Pokemon but with Fate/Stay Night UBW budget. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThat OP though, so damn catchy! The soundtrack is also good, although nothing to write home about. In reality, it's the seiyuus that shine in this series, for they definitely capture the \"characteristics\" (cause really, how characteristic can these waifus be?) of their characters! All in all, the sound is great, nothing special, but still up there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nWAIFUS!!!! So, besides the generic and boring MC, you got a nice selection of girls to add to your waifu collection. Sure, the waifus are generic as well, but they still have a lot of character and are really likable if thou art a casual. You got the hot tempered and big boobied Mai, who can beat anyone at limbo. You got the shy, flat, but incredibly moe Reina, who is one of those filthy bastards who can eat 5000 caloriesa day and gain 0 pounds. (Screw those guys). You have the underaged loli Kurumi, who is just pure moe (and a good reason to go to jail). You got Koito, the cold and serious one who, you guessed it, opens up to the MC for some reason. And of course, you got the little fairy Ruru, who is just there for comedic relief and midget fan service! Pretty unoriginal? Yes. Still likable? I guess?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nMusaigen is one of those ups and downs anime. Due to its episodic nature, some episodes will be better than others! While there were some that were kinda boring and a chore to sit through, there were some that were genuinely entertaining or even feels heavy! Those good episodes overshadowed the bad ones for me, but not everyone is gonna agree on that one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nGeneric, unoriginal, shit story, but not a bad show overall! It's another one of those entertainment > quality kind of shows, and I'm not a hater of those! Go you, Musaigen!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: I ain't afraid of no Phantoms.",

            "content": "Nearly every year for the past few years, we\u2019ve been getting a new series by Kyoto Animation. The studio alone invites attention as they are a powerhouse studio for high quality production in terms of technical visuals. But when it comes to storytelling, there\u2019s a mixed bag there. Just ask Kyoukai no Kanata. However, this is Myriad Colors Phantom World, a series about a group of teenagers dealing problems with Phantoms, creatures that comes in forms of all different shape and sizes due to imaginative perception. What I like to describe this show is a festival of fan service and nothing more than a punchin the face to fans who thought they were actually expecting some good.\\n\\n\r\nAdapting from the light novel of the same name, it\u2019s noticeable that the series itself has very limited volumes. Prior to the animation adaptation announcement, there was only 1 volume published until they decided to release another volume around Fall 2015. What does this mean? It basically implies that the show follows a lot of original concepts. Light novel adaptations are usually a big hit or miss and this is no exception. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s far from it. Myraid Colors Phantom World has a lot of potential that can be explored. What does it do instead? It executes a messy story with no coherent plot. Rather, it takes advantage of its female characters like the big boobed Mai and advertise them like a walking billboard of Ms. Fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode isn\u2019t just merely dumb but also trades its potentials for eye candy fan service. Now, I don\u2019t have a big problem with that as it should be expected from a show like this. The real problem is that the show strives on it and ante so aggressively that you\u2019ll soon find yourself wondering what the hell the show is really about. To paraphrase, the show is about an incident that happened 10 years ago that changed how humans perceive the world. And this incident also granted certain humans with special abilities to fight the Phantoms, mystical beings that pollute the world with their presence. The main male protagonist is Haruhiko, a young boy with the ability to seal Phantoms by drawing them into his sketchbook. Joining him on his quest is Mai Kawakami, a girl who can fight using an ability called 'Spirit of the Five Elements' that allows her to channel elemental energy into her fists. The problem with the duo is that their performance have been dreadful so they recruit new members to their team. In essence, the story is about these characters fighting phantoms although there will be times when you\u2019ll be scratching your head because of how farfetched the show attempts to focus on its gimmicks.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, we got Reina Izumi, a girl with a large appetite and ability to seal Phantoms by eating them. Koito Minase, a loner with the ability to use soundwaves and music to fight off Phantoms also gets involved in their affairs. The four main characters are basically established as crusaders to rid the world of Phantoms. As heroic as this sounds, the show is hard to take seriously with their daily misadventures and shenanigans. Almost all the characters suffers from some generic trait that is easily forgettable. Haruhiko is also a very dull male protagonist as it looks like the girls are often the ones dominating the missions and he is more of the supporting player. The show is also structured more based on individual characters for the first half of the series but Haruhiko gets almost no characterization at all. Even Kurumi, a little girl with a cute teddy bear gets her own spotlight episode while Haruhiko is on the sidelines drawing pictures and being nearly irrelevant. \\n\\n\r\nDespite my issue with the storytelling, the creativity of the series is actually quite fun to get attached to. Phantom World takes advantage knowing that and puts characters into imaginative worlds that seems to be inspired by other fantasy fiction. In addition, the show\u2019s Phantoms are all diverse and nothing seems repetitive with what the characters fight on a weekly basis. It also ties to their interpersonal problems at times so there\u2019s more purpose than trying to increase the team\u2019s performance scores.  On the other hand, the comedy is generally a miss. The lewd jokes quickly becomes old and repetitive with no sense of purpose other than being what it is. Then, there\u2019s Ruru, a character that adds nothing more than as a comical foil and often suggestive remarks. Many of the other comedic moments deals with the episodes themselves like cat shenanigans, awkward dialogues, and fan service that\u2019s shoved down our throats.\\n\\n\r\nAs with most Kyoto Animation series, the visual quality is solid. Ranging from the artistic backgrounds to the imaginative concepts, the studio puts a fair amount of effort to make the show look gloriously good. Character designs are what people will expect from the studio with a high concentration of colors. Then, there\u2019s of course the fan service. The camera really seems to have a fetish or something for Mai because every episode focuses on her body more than her character. Just watch the infamous limbo scene if you\u2019re wondering why. It also seems like her breasts bounces up and down nearly every episode like it\u2019s denting the laws of physics\u2026\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is moderate. Nothing more or nothing less is the easy way to say it. The OP song has some decent choreography while the ED song is very playful with the main girls. Character voice mannerism is also moderate although Ruru acts like she is trying to be as irritating as she can be each time she\u2019s on screen. Koito\u2019s cold personality is reflected in her voice and she has an emo-like voice mannerism that\u2019s easily forgettable. I guess that can be said the same for Haruhiko since he\u2019s about as dull as watching paint dry. The battle OST is another story though. That\u2019s actually quite decent.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a silly series in the end. Really, there\u2019s not much to it besides the show being somewhat self-aware and trying to capitalize on its premise. In the end, what it delivers is a less than average story but more of a generic fest of ridiculousness. And if you ask yourself why, it\u2019s probably because the show isn\u2019t met to be taken seriously in the first place. However, it\u2019s still a foolish show to embrace because almost every episode feels like a lazy grab bag of uncharacteristic ideas that\u2019s executed by the characters. There will be some episodes that have better characterization than the others. But for all it\u2019s worth, the show is a joke of itself. And it\u2019s not really funny at all.",

            "content": "There are many things I found interesting and not so interesting about Musaigen no Phantom World. Perhaps one of the most notable things about the damn show is that it's entire story, characters, and other plot related things are overused. During my time watching this show, it felt like I have literally seen this type of show with the same concepts, plot and similar characters way too many times.. It was too typical, better yet generic. Now, don't get me wrong the show itself is pretty decent, good amount of fan service, watchable and has its moments of where it stands out sometimes, however Ijust didn't think the original creator and KyoAni used their full potential while making the anime adaption. \\n\\n\r\nNow I won't go rambling on too much about how much I was dissatisfied with it. Because as mention earlier I said it was interesting, here is why. While the show may lack creativity the characters and entertainment that occurs during the show is actually at time completely enjoyable. a few of the things I liked most about it was that the episodes were sort of refreshing in a way. The show doesn't spend too much time focusing on many different and unnecessarily convoluted problems for like 2-3 episodes. Just about Every episode you can expect a new phantom to appear, new problems to develop plus you, well I got to enjoy seeing so much craziness occur.\\n\\n\r\nNow, back to characters again, I didn't really care for our main characters. As far as character personalities, appearance, and design the character sort of felt like, or came off as if they being forced to be cute. The guy, our plain, vanilla MC was so generic that I really cannot add any sort of personal opinion on him. I kid you not, and I am so glad many other users have noticed too, but there is a character like him every other anime season. \"plain\" \"generic\" \"Special power only the MC\" and same personality that is shared many other Main characters in shows like this. \\n\\n\r\nAside from them being boring I noticed that a lot of the characters special abilities were kind of ripped off from the series Date-A-Live. I only noticed this after watching the latest D.A.L. movie. both girls use their voices to attack and repel enemy attacks and Loli's both have an attachment to their animals, although one is a teddy bear and Yoshino's is a puppet.\\n\\n\r\nNow with that said, I cannot delve too much into characters being ripped off of each other. That is because original characters died around the late 90's or at the very latest early 2000s' If I had to guess I would personally say around 2002-2006 was the era in which OC characters died. In a way I do believe it makes since though because after time, the only logical thing to do is take old characters and try to mold them into your own characters. For example many artist and creators, like to take characters from other shows and add their own personal experiences to those characters and things usually take off from there.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on from characters and stuff, which agitated me for some odd reason, the animation was pretty damn fine. Characters were very well animated from their original designs. Lots of the fighting scenes were great, however not too special. There were some exciting moments and some less, overall I'd have to say a fair amount.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I ended up giving the show a 6/10 because there is lots of potential, or unused potential in this show. Overall I felt like it was Musaigen no Phantom World was simple. Nothing too extraordinary or extravagant enough worth mentioning. I personally believe that it will be a title that will soon be forgotten. Lastly, yes, I do have to agree that  it is not the best thing to come out of Kyoto animations... Animation was great, music was okay however the overall presentation was mediocre.. or \"Fine\" at best.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Musaigen no Phantom World is an anime that is both highly overrated and highly underrated. Wait a minute though, how can that be? Aren't those mutually exclusive? Not at all. To understand what is going on here, we must delve into some basic history of Kyo-ani.\r\n  For the past few years, Kyoani has been keeping this pattern of shows that feature cute girls with some supernatural elements thrown into a fairly straightforward story plus an overall lighthearted atmosphere. Amagi Brilliant Park, Kyoukai no Kanata, and to a lesser degree Chuunibyou are examples of this trend. And now comes Musaigen to add tothis growing pile.\\n\\n\r\n  The thing that seems to be annoying fans is that Kyoani is somewhat guilty of self plagiarism. The characters in Musaigan all feel somewhat...familiar. Very familiar. \"Didn't we see this character in that other show Kyoani did two years ago?\" familiar. Musaigen is also very episodic, which is something anime fans probably didn't want. The result is a lot of people love to hate this show. It gets put up on a spike and hailed around as proof that Kyoani is done for. They have nothing left. Problem with this mentality is it just isn't true. It's hating a show for reasons that have to do with other shows by the same studio, which doesn't really tell you much about the quality of Musaigen as a stand alone work. \\n\\n\r\n  On the flip side, rabid Kyoani fans who love everything they do absolutely gobble it up like it's another masterpiece. Musaigen is decent, but a masterpiece it is certainly not. The story is enjoyable and the characters are entertaining, but it's also very forgettable. The last couple of episodes of Musaigen was the only thing that made the show stand out from the rest. The only key ingredient that makes the show worth watching over others from the same season is the higher standard of art and animation quality that Kyoani generally aims for. \\n\\n\r\n The reality here is if Musaigen and Amagi switched air dates, they would probably switch critical reception as well. People would be hating on Amagi for being a clone of Musaigen. Musaigen, for all its troubles, isn't actually that bad.\\n\\n\r\n If you can look past the controversy and just judge Phantom World for what it is and not what you want it to be, it's a good weekend watch. Just don't expect anything seriously deep or amazing. Go into this show with realistic expectations and it's fairly enjoyable. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Many of my favorite reviewers rejected this series right away, which made me think negatively of it as well. After so much talk online following episode one\u2019s airing, I grew curious, and decided to watch the first few episodes. It helped that I recognized Kyoto animation\u2019s gorgeous artwork, and kept in mind my love for the Free! series, also done by Kyoani. I was hooked after episode one! Can I also just say that I love the school uniforms?\r\nThe characters are probably 50% of why I enjoyed this series so much. I resonate so much with Haruhiko as a person, and his little freak outsare unreasonably hilarious to me! Ruru is just a sassy little chatterbox, but she brings so much energy into the room, and not to mention, she's irrisitably adorable! You might not appreciate Reina and Mai that much until a bit later in the series, but they grow on you as well. I will say, however that all of the characters, including Haruhiko (who is supposed to be highly intelligent), can be ditzy at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development didn't seem to be the creators' main focus of the show, they just sort of sprinkled it here and there, but they did it just enough for me to become emotionally involved. Especially towards the end, Haruhiko really starts \"coming into his own\", as they say, and I was glad they arranged that, but it seems like they just sort of threw it in. \\n\\n\r\nI was also fascinated by the complexity of phantoms, and enjoyed seeing each different kind of phantom.\\n\\n\r\nThis series includes a few moments of ecchi, but it was by no means overdone in my opinion, and it was more comical than sexy.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also a subtle sense of harem elements in some episodes, but I enjoyed that it was all kept considerably low-key, and nobody ends up on a real date or even considering an official relationship. It really maintained the series\u2019 light-heartedness.\\n\\n\r\nKyoani has yet again produced one of my favorites!",

            "content": "Phantom World was a huge disappointment and in my eyes, the worst anime that Kyoto Ani has put out during its entire run featuring boring characters, no sense of direction or plot with its narrative and huge bouncing tits that give me PTSD of the time in which I watched the Eiken OVA.\r\nFor starters, it feels like none of the characters were made to be precisely that: characters. It feels as if their entire personality and appearance was made, with the sole purpose of being as marketable as possible to the otaku audience since none of the characters are unique in terms of design norpersonality. \\n\\n\r\nMai is the one with the big tits and she is also a potential 'love interest' for our main male protagonist. That's it. Reina is the girl who likes to swallow things whole (rather like Kirby). That's it. Koito is the reserved, cool one. That's it. Kurumi is the loli character. Guess what? That's it. Finally, we have our main character, Haruhiko, the bland self-insert who finds himself surrounded by a bunch of women, likes books and has a vast amount of knowledge to deal with any situation. Literally, every situation. It feels as if Haruhiko's only role in this show is to provide exposition and facts to the other characters in order to conveniently seize a victory against the phantom they are fighting. As a result of this, there is no tension or intrigue in any of these phantom encounters (with the exception of the last) since Haruhiko always has some kind of knowledge hidden away in order to conveniently defeat the enemy.\\n\\n\r\nWhile on the topic of exposition, there are many episodes which start off with Haruhiko talking to the audience about what the plot of the episode is going to be while telling us every idea and theme that will be related to the proceeding episode. This was not only a boring way to start off an episode as we had to sit through dull exposition but it also makes the proceeding content pointless. If we already know the plot of an episode and what themes and messages they're going to use in said episode BEFORE even watching the show, why should we care? Don't you think it would be more interesting if the audience can interpret stuff ourselves instead of having a character spell out all the plot for us as if we're damn idiots and can't think for ourselves.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is very straightforward opting for a phantom of the week structure, which would be fine if I found any of these encounters to be interesting in the slightest. Most of the phantoms they come across are unique in design but overall don't really do much or pose much a threat and instead seem to be designed with the sole purpose of revealing as much female skin as possible. Such examples include an ape-type phantom, in which they try to seduce him by painting Mai's ass red, or a phantom that changes everyone into a cat or a phantom that places censor bars over the outfits of people to make it seem as if they're wearing nothing at all. It's clearly trying to appeal to every fetish and demographics to try and rake in more viewers and make a few more extra expensive blu-ray sales.\\n\\n\r\nIt could be argued that this is all for fun and that the show is trying to be a tongue in check ecchi comedy of some sorts which I could understand if it were not for the fact that everything is so boring and just too stupid for me to even consider this notion. Most situations and story arcs were not created with the purpose of developing characters but instead were made just to appeal to as large as a group as possible. Most of the introductory episodes for the characters at least attempt to develop the characters in some way and try to give the character more depth but there is not nearly enough time devoted to each one to feel as if they have changed at all. The only time a hint of intrigue makes itself apparent in the show is near the end, which actually does a decent job at developing Haruhiko's character while also developing the relationship between the two nicely. Unfortunately, by this point, it was too little too late and the show doesn't allow enough time for all too much development past its surface level.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters and the narrative both suck, the music and the animation are the only two salvageable things out of this entire production. The music kicks ass from the opening credits to the ending and does do a good job at invoking a sense of excitement during the more action-heavy scenes. The animation is very consistent and flows very well from shot to shot with great composition and visual flow combining that with flashy colours and good fight choreography makes for a great visual experience. While the characters are speaking you can also see subtle changes in their facial expressions mid-conversation which shows the talent from both a directing standpoint and a technical standpoint too. The anime, from a technical standpoint, looks great which is why it pains me to see such great animation wasted on a mediocre cast and narrative. In my eyes, this is one of the worst anime Kyoto Ani has made and I wouldn't recommend it, even if you're looking for an ecchi show as there are better ones out there. At least Hibike Euphonium 2 is repairing the damage done to the reputation to this studio...\\n",

            "content": "Aside from Erased\u2019s score, this seems to have trousled the most bones in the Winter 2016 season, and it\u2019s hard to see why. Look, I know everyone thinks \u201cwaaahhhh kyoani is rip!!!\u201d But, come on. It can\u2019t be that bad\u2026 right\u2026? Ri--oh GOD she won a game of Limbo by bouncing her tits? WAAAHHHH KYOANI IS RIP!!!\r\nI want to feel bad for whoever originally conceived Myriad Fuck-ups Phantom World. I think the concept of this series is pretty great: some virus breaks out and causes the brain to function differently, therefore causing supernatural beings, known as \"Phantoms\", to be seen by people. Children birthed andbreastfed afterwards would then develop superpowers so that Phantoms can be fought against.\\n\\n\r\nI want to like the concept, but since Phantoms appear all the time and can have major effects, it makes me wonder what the fuck anyone did before all these super-powered kids showed up to get rid of Phantoms. Like, they say Phantoms have always been around, only no-one could see them before, but when they\u2019re able to send people to other dimensions or turn everyone within a wide radius into a fucking cat, it\u2019s a miracle that society could even develop with these buggers around. Then you have the superpowers which make little-to-no sense. Everyone birthed and breastfed after this virus just ends up with superpowers for fighting Phantoms. ...except instead of everyone having really basic and similar powers or something, characters can have very unique and specific powers, like controlling a teddy bear, fondling your own titties, or going \u201cAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nBut, whatever. Ignoring the questions regarding the concept, I still kinda like it. To make it better, the show incorporates pre-existing themes of psychology as well; most episodes will start off with the main character explaining a theory that will be demonstrated in the episode. With this, I want to believe the original author was throwing out some legitimate ideas for a story and all, but some editor/publisher came in and said \"NAH\" to a bunch of it, and made it more \"accessible\" by adding in dumb fanservice, annoying \"cutesy\" characters, and by removing any sort of plot. Now it\u2019s a true light novel! But that's just what I optimistically believe. I don't actually know how this gallery of dicks came into being.\\n\\n\r\nBut, despite having some interesting ideas, they are executed in the most boring, overused, generic, and uninteresting way possible. Instead of having a remotely interesting plot with an actual villain or drama, we get a series of episodes that each introduce some new Phantom, which the boring protagonist and his near-equally boring friends must dispose of somehow as part of their duty in their boring school. There is no plot whatsoever. Something weird will happen, and then someone will ask \u201cIs this the work of a Phantom?!\u201d like a complete fucking idiot (this happens literally every episode what the hell do they think it is), they struggle to get rid of the Phantom until they get rid of the Phantom, and then they go home and repeat the process the next day. That\u2019s the \u201cstory.\u201d Hooray.\\n\\n\r\nMusaigen seems to be action-based for the most part, but fights are actually very short and forgettable despite the great production values. The only things I actually remember are the laughable things, such as Haruhiko\u2019s somehow endearing summons (Cthulu best girl) and the chants that characters, for some reason, HAVE to use in order to use their abilities. Thank god, because this show couldn\u2019t rightfully call itself a comedy without them. (shirabeshirabeshirabeshirabeAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH) \\n\\n\r\nInstead of fighting, most situations are cleared through problem solvin\u2026\u2026\u2026erm, scratch that. No, in order to make most Phantoms go or be sealed away peacefully, the characters just go along with whatever their conundrum is or fix their life problems themselves, whether it\u2019s by participating in a really really bad play or by slapping red paint on your ass. This is what true, quality action is all about, kids. And no, I\u2019m not specifically saying that the fanservice of this show is stupid. It\u2019s just the events causing the writers to make excuses to have fanservice that are stupid.\\n\\n\r\nWhile each episode tries to add more to the characters, these efforts are pretty silly and forgettable, and anything we learn about the characters has no actual value to the \u201cnarrative\u201d. For example, Reina has some over-protective parents who don\u2019t want her fighting Phantoms for no reason at all (no, we don\u2019t actually meet her parents, but we should be grateful because this is the only character with any sort of backstory), but that conflict is resolved in an episode or two. And what do we get out of it? Nothing. Nothing changes at all. The series pretends to develop its characters, but at best they made Minase less of a cunt. That\u2019s all I got out of thirteen episodes.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cBut episodes 11-13 were so great and emotional!\u201d --that annoying voice in my head that spouts out potential arguments. They were great and emotional in the same way that Oreo changing the color of their cremes each season is great and emotional. Congrats to Nabsico for changing something and putting a little heart into it, but at the end of the day I\u2019m still getting a goddamn sandwich cookie. And that cookie is more valuable to me than this entire anime.\\n\\n\r\nI should regroup before I lose everyone here. My point is that a good episode of Myriad Colors is still Myriad Colors. It\u2019s not interesting, it\u2019s often annoying, and the characters are lame. I\u2019m afraid that it\u2019s a little too late to make me invested in the characters that you\u2019ve already taken the opportunity to establish.\\n\\n\r\nSo, who is this phenomenal cast of weridos? There\u2019s Haruhiko, your traditional high school kid who doesn\u2019t live with his parents because reasons and has no personality at all. Mai is your typical hot-headed female lead who does most of the fighting. Mai\u2019s Breasts support Mai a lot and help her fight. Reina, the only character with a backstory and a superior design, should actually be the fanservice character. Everyone likes a girl that swallows. MinAHHHHHHHse speaks for herself. Probably listens to shit music tho. There\u2019s also Ruru. \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 I\u2019d really rather not talk about this character. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I go on, has anyone seen this child? She\u2019s like five years old with lavender hair and carries a teddy bear around. Please, anyone, come claim her soon because her voice is giving me cancer, and she has no reason to be in this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of this show is flat. Nothing about it stands out in any way. The OP and ED are generally the main catches of an anime, but they\u2019re passable at best. The voice acting isn\u2019t particularly bad, but Rurururiruiuriuriururiuaiuruiairuri and Kurumi have incredibly annoying voices. It doesn\u2019t help that this shithead Tinker Ruru needs to insert her opinion into literally everything that happens on the fucking screen. Can you tell that I\u2019m annoyed? I hate this character so much. If there\u2019s any saving grace, it\u2019s that Reina has the smoothest, sexiest womanly voice ever, and the noise she makes when using her power is hot. (the jokes literally write themselves with this girl)\\n\\n\r\nTo save the best for last, the art is incredible. Nothing less should be expected from Kyoto Animation, even in their bad shows. The character designs are gorgeous, but Mai wears some really weird outfit consisting of a yellow vest over a black long-sleeved shirt. It doesn\u2019t look good, and it breaks consistency, since she goes to a school and everyone but her wears the same uniform. I thought they just gave her that outfit so that Mai\u2019s Breasts could get more screentime, but then she ditches the vest and wears the normal uniform and Mai\u2019s Breasts are still perfectly visible then. Yeah, I dunno. The other thing is that the series starts off with an amazing sequence where Haruhiko is barely awake, and the world looks like a giant Tetris level for a bit because that\u2019s how brains work now. It\u2019s beautiful and had me incredibly stoked for what lied ahead, but there aren\u2019t any more great sequences like that for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, even if I wanted a little more, there still wasn\u2019t a dull moment in the visuals for me. The Phantoms have a mystical, cartoony vibe to them, and the show certainly lives up the name \u201cMyriad Colors Phantom World\u201d by being really colorful with its attacks and environments. It\u2019s hard to deny that the Gumdrop Kingdom or whatever the fuck that stupid teddy bear world was was ugly, despite its vomit-inducing sillyness. I hate kids.\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s anything else to say, it\u2019s that Myriad Colors Phantom World wasn\u2019t a disaster, exactly\u2026 it wasn\u2019t \u201cso bad that it\u2019s good\u201d, and won\u2019t be considered as such\u2026 if anything, the show is just an embarrassment for the legendary Kyoto Animation. Like many series, it has potential, but just doesn\u2019t have the writing or the heart to back it up. Even the things that it actually tries to accomplish are half-hearted. \\n\\n\r\nI wouldn\u2019t even watch it just for the visuals. Just go watch another KyoAni show, really.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 2/10\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nSound - 3/10\\n\r\nCharacters - 2/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 2/10\\n\r\nFanservice - pmmereinahentai/10\\n\r\nOverall - 2/10\\n\r\nFavorite character - Reina\\n\r\nFavorite episode - 12\\n\r\nRecommendation level - Very low",

Since not all Phantoms aren't good, there are groups of Phantom hunters who specialise in the sealing of these entities with their know abilities. This story follows the life of one group of Phantom hunters starting with a guy named Haruhiko Ichijou and his phantom friend Ruru, who grow by adding more members and gain more experiements throughout the series. \r\nThe anime itself was beautiful with the different choices of colours and the battlescenes showing even more use of colour.

The opening song, Naked Drive was also a great choice though I did need a little warming up listening to it before actually enjoying it and same goes with the ending song too. \\n\\n\r\nWith the characters, there were a lot of moments that gave me the feeling of, here is another cliche, however, I did like them, even if I had a little crush on Reina Izumi, and allowing to connect to them made the whole series great as they all fell into their own parts for the overall story line.\\n\\n\r\nI very much enjoyed this anime and would want to buy this series on dvd when the change arises so I can go back and revisit that world.

            "content": "Let's put the negative review aside.\r\nI can say that KyoAni is trying to improve in somewhat action-oriented animation prodiction. And I found Musaigen no Phantom World to be enjoyable, of course it's really different from their earlier works, but it's a good presentation of what they're trying to do.\r\nI want to point some of the things that actually I considered to be a good change.\r\n1. Their presentation of animation style in action is actually really good. You can't deny that the characters movement while fighting is really smooth than most of action anime. Also the added effects in fight scenes might need to be brusheda bit, but they're pretty neat so far.\\n\\n\r\n2. For me, Story plot is really interesting, the world setting might be similar with most fantasy anime but this one is really refreshing, and I found every episode is pretty fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nAnd the thing that I found lacking, is.\\n\\n\r\n1. At the end of Episode, Like most anime, the ending is pretty proportional with the weight of the whole story, and I find that really predictable which made me unsatisfied. And after watching the final episode, those whole interesting story became not so interesting, because of the not-so-significant plot twist, and that's really predictable, I just know it from watching the 5th episode that there's no real plot twist, but still, it's really unsatisfiying.\\n\\n\r\n2. Those plot might be a bit inappropriate for underaged viewer, and I think they should made it clear to whom this show is being shown at. But I have no problem with how the story is being stringed up. Pretty interesting If I say so. Some people might think KyoAni confused personal fetishism with people amusement. It's okay, like as I said before, they should made it clear to whom this show is being shown at. I won't be hypocryte, I like what KyoAni did there.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so, I declare Musaigen no Phantom World to be a good Anime to watch, if you're looking for amusement, and a bit interesting environment setting. Just don't ask children to watch it so seriously because.. uhm.. you know....",

Mai Kawakami is the reluctant fanservice girl of the series and LA gets why some people really like her, however LA still preferred Reina over Mai, as for Mai's development, LA saw that Mai got the best development out of the \"supposed harem\". The loner Koito Minase voiced by ''Maaya Uchida'' later on, the bear themed Kurumi Kumakura voiced by ''Misaki Kuno'' does get their own character development episodes but again like Reina falls under the harem and \"joining the cast\", finally we have Ruru voiced by ''Azusa Tadokoro'', the mascot of this anime series and is a Phantom who \"helps\" and LA says helps as loosely as possible the group, she's really just tags along than anything else until her one episode focused entirely on her. LA has been going to the basics of the characters for this review merely because the bulk of the anime is ABOUT the character interactions with each other under the \"themed\" or \"character-driven\" episode.\\n\\n\r\nOddly enough when LA said that this anime would have the cliched tired trope of \"supernatural battle harem\", it seems as if that's more of a \"place setting\" than the core focus of the anime, the core focus is developing the cast through themed episodes as well as building the world and lore of Phantoms and dealing with in wacky and hilarious ways. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation done by Kyoto Animation, well LA won't lie, their visual flair and character designs are eye candy to see and with the \"wacky\" Phantom battles are sometimes a visual spectacle, even if it is a \"supernatural battle harem\", Kyoto Ani doesn't slack, and that's one of the finer points of Musaigen no Phantom World. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending comes in as a 2 episode arc and although the build up is rather predictable, it really starts getting good by the finale episode where that loose plotline way early from anime finally gets brought up as well as a small plot twist that actually made the finale well worth the wait to watch. \\n\\n\r\nMusaigen no Phantom World may fall under the \"supernatural battle harem\" cliches however due to it's focused episodic format where they develop both the main cast but the world and lore of where Phantoms and humans interact with each other it's more of a slice of life battle harem with both huge expositionary moments from Haruhiko and some of it's anime genre tropes flipped for better or worse...but mainly for the better.",

            "content": "Considering we're talking about Musaigen no Phantom World, I want to give my own piece of my mind about this series. Of course, there's been a lot of talking about this for my experience, from MAL forums towards Facebook, some YouTubers, etc. It's kind of the say that it's a show that I wanted to rather share a thought rather than reviewing it, but considering I'm writing in the review section I might as well give myself a thought of the spectrum.\r\nMusaigen no Phantom World has been one of those shows that (maybe) many people were looking forward to, mainly because of the well-known animestudio also known as Kyoto Animation, which they're famous for their shows such as K-On!, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Hibike! Euphonium, CLANNAD, etc. They're known for having also a good track record around the market, but a little bit of their lineups aren't very impressive (example Kyoukai no Kanata, Air). While I do have to agree that Musaigen no Phantom World didn't live up into the expectation level of Kyoto Animation, I kind of think that at the same time many people are giving a kick into the butt on the show because it's one of those... *ahem*\\n\\n\r\n\"Stereotypical Light Novel Adaptations.\"\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Musaigen no Phantom World falls into that medium, its source material is based off of the Light Novel of the same name, which quite frankly it's not really a bad thing considering from what I've seen from the anime in itself, it's really ain't bad. But at the same time I don't think the series wasn't good either, or anything amazing.\\n\\n\r\nLet me explain what I mean by this with the show.\\n\\n\r\nBasically the series has more of a character focus route more than the story focus, while it isn't bad per say it would technically degrade the show's quality of story telling. The story telling in the series can defined as:\\n\\n\r\nCliche\\n\r\nGeneric\\n\r\nand of course, Unoriginal.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a thing that maybe turns people off and steady because not all people would want something like this. Many people would want something rather refreshing or new, or something that ticks off the notch. Well, originality doesn't exist, but what does Musaigen no Phantom World even do to make it seem rather tolerable for me or at least decent?\\n\\n\r\nWell, it's pretty simple.\\n\\n\r\nThe show isn't really trying to be anything special or amazing, but then it seems like Kyoto Animation is implementing their style to it, in order to be more entertaining and fun. For example per each character arc they add some little bit of their specialty, which is the execution of the drama in itself. It seems rather nice and refreshing to get a little bit of a Kyoto Animation feel like their previous shows. They really nail in that spectrum and specialty, especially in one of the arcs (I think Reina's story) was rather one of the best episodes the series has in stock. \\n\\n\r\nAlso it seems like Phantom World knows how to give characters some screentime without leaving them out of the picture, and I mean the main cast. They get at least a decent amount of characterization throughout the series and while they're kind of strayed away a bit from the archetypes. Also, Kyoto Animation knows how to give a charm towards these characters, since that's of course their type of thing in the end.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodic nature of the show would be rather repetitive per say because, we're getting these characters doing the daily routine and trying to capture these Phantoms. The story is weak in that standard because meanwhile each episode its its own thing, it doesn't do well with fleshing out the story at all, or at least, they're not trying to do so.\\n\\n\r\nFor the comedy department I'd say it's a hit or miss for people. Technically speaking its kind of your cliches but at the same times these cliche moments have this little charm to it that makes it quite tolerable, it's hard to explain but, I take it like some other shows from this area as well.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art and animation, it seems quite well done as usual for the studio. They made the series rather bright and colorful, using different types of textures with the hair color tips and the designs as well to stand out from your other character designs. The cinematography in this series is rather beautifully done as well, they do give as usual, effort in trying to make the series look good and flow with motion and livelyhood. That I will appreciate it the most.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack I'd say... well, not forgettable, but more like it's not really anything unique or spectacular. I do agree that the OST fits with said scenarios and that's pretty cool. But I don't really get the full grasp on it.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the voice acting, they're nice and well preformed, at least as far as I'm concerned with the tone and the proper timing these actors use. It makes these characters fun and entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThe Opening has a rather modern tech and jumpy beat for at least most part, it gets me really pumped for the later episodes and of course its fine and dandy. Actually it's on my top 10 favorite Openings of the season.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Ending... Ehh... not so much to say about this one, but its pretty cute, I'll say that.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment/Perspective:\\n\\n\r\nHonestly I can get why people were disappointed for Phantom World. I won't deny that its kind of lackluster compared to their other works, but I personally think people are being a tad bit too harsh on it. Why? I don't really think it's doing anything bad, It's just the story has the weakest approach around for my eyes, and while it's the weakest, I personally think it can be tolerable enough.\\n\\n\r\nI also think that people were expecting too much about Phantom World, and that's because of the studio in itself. I mean heck, I wasn't expecting that much at the beginning, and I still think its quite a fun watch regardless of it. In comparison to other shows that aired in the same season, THAT DID FAR WORSE and failed epically, Phantom World is one of those series that it's rather doing nothing special, but having still their Kyoto Touch.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, if you want a show to pass the time and have fun, I would highly recommend this if you want to give it a try. But, if you're looking for something rather with a big story telling or \"stand-out\" direction from the studio, please go and watch something else. You would be disappointed in the end.\\n",

            "content": "Why KyoAni? (Spoilers) \r\nStory: 5/10\r\nMusaigen no Phantom World has that generic concept that teenagers doing some magic and going to school bla bla... But in noragami style! Let me explain, teenagers that have some superpowers are hunting imaginary things called phantoms. Some of them dangerous creatures, some of them limbo dancing telephone poles, some of them pervert UFOs... Interesting, right? But actually nothing happened. It's an episodic anime so most of the people hates it (and the fanservice) but I don't care if it's episodic or not. I liked some episodic animes before (OPM, Joukamachi no Dandelion...), so for me the important parts are charactersand enjoyment. I even liked the plots of the episodes, 11th and 12th episodes were really good. Some drama, some character developments, some serious and ''2 episodic'' plot and BAM! I thought finally my hopes came true, it made me say ''Wow, that anime is getting some good points.'' BUT then, the final episode happened. I was so hopefull for this episode, I waited like serious plottwist, but what I got was action, forced fanservice and an actually no sense plot. That Ruru-Haruhiko thing was stupid and they actually kissed? Sorry but this is forced and bad fanservice. If they made a great final, I would even give 7/10 for story. But the thing I loved is that Haruhiko gives some information about something at every episode's begining and it's the plot of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nKyoAni is gorgeous again. KyoAni has my favourite style of character designs and that animations are awesome, even Reina's swallowing power.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAt first I didn't like the OP song but now it's so catchy. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are of course loveable, even they're a little cliche. Kyo Ani usually focuses on the characters and they did it again. There is at least one episode that focuses on one character and that character's development. I loved Mai, Reina and Ruru's development but I can't say it for Koito. And sorry Reina, Mai is still the best girl.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is entertaining. I don't know if you're enjoying this series but I am definetly enjoying. Some people say it has too much fanservice but I think it's not. Uhm, maybe some episodes tho... But generally there wasn't over fanservice, and it wasn't harem either. I wanted MaixHaruhiko but it didn't happen. Maybe more romance could make this anime better. We know Kyo Ani is how good at comedy, romance and drama. And yeah the anime was generally full of comedy but every episode's ending has a little drama. Especially last episodes made the drama good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWell, I actually liked this anime but again it could be a lot better. Especially the story...",

            "content": "The human brain is possibly the most complex biological entity on planet Earth. It evolved over millions of years into something capable of not only surviving despite having no physical advantage over our predators but also into something capable of deciphering the numerous secrets of the universe.\r\nWhen an anime tries to tackle something as complex as the human psyche you would think it\u2019s an anime with a serious tone and serious characters. Well, not necessarily, today I am taking a look at the Winter 2016 anime which revolves around the human brain: Musaigen no Phantom World or Myriad Colours Phantom World in English.\r\nPlot and characters\r\nTheplot of Musaigen no Phantom World revolves around a group of students living in a world in which all sorts of monsters and fairy tale characters run wild. The world being in this state is the result of  an accident at a research facility which modified the brain of every human around the world.\\n\r\nThe main characters of the show, as I\u2019ve mentioned are a group of students who are all members of the Neural Error Corrections Club; a club in which all the members have superpowers which they use to deal with evil monsters or Phantoms as the show calls them.\\n\\n\r\nOur male lead is the smart but clueless and at times useless Ichijo Haruhiko. He has the power  to seal away all the evil Phantoms and along with his teammate Kawakami Mai, who utilizes elemental powers, forms the weakest group in the club. There\u2019s not a lot to say about Haruhiko\u2019s personality he is honestly pretty empy personality wise. The more notable things are his ability to create a harem and his issues concerning his parents which become important towards the end of the series. Other than that he is just there so that the audience can project on to him. He is never directly involved in fights, most of the time being relegated to just sucking up the enemies into his book or summoning other Phantoms to fight for him.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve mentioned her earlier but our main female lead is Kawakami Mai. She is also the poster girl for this anime. Mai is an athletic tomboy who has been friends with Haruhiko for a while before the series begins. Now, you\u2019d think that because she is the poster girl for the series she would get a lot of backstory and screentime.  Nope, she is instead given the task of providing as much fanservice as possible with some sexy moves for when she uses an ability and even a scene where Haruhiko paints her butt. Once again, her character also fall short because of the lack of development.\\n\r\nOh, and there\u2019s also that frankly annoying Ruru who is Haruhiko\u2019s childhood friend Phantom and the shows main source of terrible comic relief. She is a special Phantom who doesn\u2019t want to harm humans and is actually really friendly. She is sort of like Na\u2019Vi, tries to be helpful but ends up being more of a nuisance. She suddenly becomes really important at the end of the show which comes out of the blue considering that she\u2019s basically done nothing up until that point except for messing things up a lot.\\n\\n\r\nWe also have some characters who join the main cast after a \u201cquest\u201d has been performed for them. These characters are: the cheerful and shy Izumi Reina, the quiet and mysterious Minase Koito, and the \u201conly exists because we need a loli\u201d Kumamakura Kurumi. All of which suffer from the same problems as our original dynamic duo. With them getting 1 or 2 episodes of character development before being assigned a role and an archetype and then being pushed to the side.\\n\r\nThe anime is episodic in nature with only the last 2 episodes being connected by a common plot thread. Almost everything is reset to the status-quo at the end of each episode which makes one episode in particular totally pointless and skipable, coincidentaly this episode is also the hot springs episode of the series.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s talk a bit about the ecchi aspect of the series. I generally find that there is nothing wrong with having some fanservice in a show as long as it doesn\u2019t sacrifice plot just to show me some boobs. This show however takes it\u2019s already non-existing plot and puts some ecchi in it; some very painful ecchi scenes which give me flashbacks to Heavy Object. It\u2019s like they are afraid to put the ecchi in so they half-ass it and somehow make it more in-your-face than it would normally be and also painful to watch at times.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodic nature of the series combined with the characters being uninteresting and unchanging for the most part is what ruins what could have been a good show. But alas, it is as my history teacher used to say \u201cHistory is what has happened, not what could have happened.\u201d\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound and Animation\\n\r\nThis is really where the series shines.  Kyoto Animation is the studio behind the animation for this work. I don\u2019t think I exaggerate when I say that this is one of the most beautiful shows ever created. The screen is filled with vibrant colours and the animations are fantastic. Almost feels like this anime had a movie budget for each and every episode. The opening animation, especially is one of the best looking openings I have seen in recent memory. I could go on praising the animation of this series for quite a while so I\u2019m just going to stop myself there.\\n\\n\r\nNow, concerning the sound design of the anime I can\u2019t really praise it that much. Sure, both the opening and ending songs are fun to listen to and there is nothing wrong with the tracks that play during the anime. There\u2019s also nothing praiseworthy, nothing that sticks out and no song that I want to listen to even after the anime is over.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict\\n\\n\r\nWasted potential is what I would call Phantom world. It brings an interesting concept and good looking animation but messes up in the story department. There\u2019s some enjoyment to be had with this show particularly if you like vibrant colours and/or softcore ecchi scenes. At the end of the day, I wish they would have focused more on the plot of the series rather than the art and fanservice. Sadly, because of the poor decisions of its creators I\u2019m giving this show a failing grade. At first I really hoped this show would pull itself together and give us something good. I wanted it to be good. But by the time episode 8 rolled around (the hot springs episode) it was obvious that the show wouldn\u2019t be saveable anymore. And so, my final score for this anime is a 4/10.\\n",

            "content": "Hey guys Sup?\r\nSo Today I'm going to Be Reviewing an Supernatural Action Anime, an Anime About a Dude that have Supernatural Abilities and also have a Harem as well, an Anime so good that it should have more than 3 Seasons, an Anime With Beautiful Animation and Epic Fights, Today I'm going to be Reviewing Phantom World!!!!\r\nNow Note this Is 100% My Opinions not Facts at all aright.\r\nNow let's get started shall we?\r\nI really Like Supernatural Anime like this One and I did like the Concept of it as well, however the Sexuality is Pretty much almost in every Episodes tbh tho. Now I don'tmind Fanservice or Ecchi in Anime, but the way Phantom World do it just makes me to watch Hentai tbh. And also the Fight in Episode and 6 feels very Lazy tbh tho, but other than that it was very fun and Watchable as well tho. I really did like the Neko Episode even know it wasn't the Best but it was good and Watchable at least.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow the Characters in here are so Unique with their Supernatural Abilities and Moe Designed as well tho.\\n\\n\\n\r\nHaruhiko, A Highschool Student that have the Power to Summon \"Weak\" Creatures (kinda like a Pokemon Trainer tbh tho.), But Tbh he's very awesome tho, great at Drawing and A Cool Harem. He's not on my Top 10 Favorite Characters tho but he's at least on my Top 15 tbh.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMai, She's The Best Girl in this Anime if you ask me tbh. Sure Her Powers are Sexual but Unique as well tbh, She's very nice After Episode 10, and I just like Her Designed as well tho. Anyways She Just your Highschool Student that Needs to Beat Monster in other to get Money tho. Also She's very Badass as well tho.\\n\\n\\n\r\nReina, Well, she's really cute tbh tho. She can Eat almost every Type of Phantom out there. And she's kinda of a Tsundere but not one of those who ignores the heck out of you tbh tho.\\n\\n\r\nKoito, A Shy Girl who always Hangout with Haruhiko and the Others tho. She have the Powers of how to put it... Sonic Boom?.. Sound Boom?..... You get my point, once she Scream she unleashed a Sonic Wave. She's also really Badass tbh tho.\\n\\n\\n\r\nKurumi, A Loli with a Bear that can Fight. She's very Cute and Badass at the same time tbh tho.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRuru, A Cute and Hilarious Fairy Who Always Follow Haruhiko all the Time. She's very cool and unique tbh tho.\\n\\n\r\nEnigma, I'm not going to Spoil her that much but all I'm going to say is that she's the Main Villain of this Show and She's very Badass as well tbh.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation It's Animated by KyoAni so I did Expect Colourful and Moe Animation. What I didn't really Expect was the Epic Fights!!! Sure I say That in Episode 5 and 6 The Fights are Lazy but that's just Episode 5 and 6, other than that is Amazing tbh tho.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack/OST Is very great tbh. The Opening is Very Catchy as well tho. The OST can be sometimes Epic or Peaceful. For me it was really cool tbh.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Results:8/10\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis my Friends, is what The Monogatari Series Should've it been. An Anime with Great Fights, Beautiful Animation, Catchy Soundtracks, Watchable for everyone, and with no Dialogue Heavy!!! And I did also like the Concept tho, it have kinda of the same Concept as The Monogatari Series but with No Boring Dialogue Heavy and More Epic Fights, witch is Awesome!!!! Sure it have some Problems like They Take The Sexuality To The Next Level and some of The Fights can Be Lazy at times (like in Episode 5 and 6 for example tho.) but is really good if you're looking for an Action Ecchi tho.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u2714Great Fights\\n\r\n\u2714Beautiful Animation By KyoAni\\n\r\n\u2714Great OST\\n\r\n\u2714Watchable\\n\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\\n\\n\r\n\ud83d\udca2Too Much Sexuality.\\n\r\n\ud83d\udca2Lazy Fights on Episode 5 and 6.\\n\\n\r\nHope this Helps alright guys.\\n\\n\r\n-Adriel The Anime Smash Bros.",

Well take a look here to find out.\r\nPros\r\n- ABSOLUTE STUNNING ANIMATION (Kyoto Ani are Gods)\r\n- Good OST\r\n- Interesting Characters (All the girls at least)\r\n- Use of Ecchi (Pool episode was hilarious)\r\n- Amazing Action scenes\r\nCons\r\n- No plot whatsoever, Mystery of Week. (Some people won't mind this but I'm not one of those people \u0ca0_\u0ca0 )\r\n- Boring and uninteresting Male protaganist. (This is from the same studio that gave us GODLIKE MC's like Kanie from \"Amagi Brillliant Park\" and Houtarou from \"Hyouka\")\r\n- Use of Ecchi (Some ofit might not be to everyones liking. Some of Mai's ecchi was just dumb especially the limbo scene)\\n\r\n- RURURURRURUR is annoying.\\n\r\n- Forgettable side characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Phantom World had its moments but it was inconsistent with me. With no plot, I found I was forcing myself to watch each episode. A lot of the jokes weren't funny. Shout out to the pool episode, it was the only episode that I enjoyed. I think this show needed 24 episodes because after reading LN, some big I MEAN BIG stuff gets revealed which would have earned respect from me for this show. But, alas this is what we got. This is by means not Kyoto Ani's worst show but their most mediocre.\\n\\n\\n\r\nGive it the 3 episode rule. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Koito best girl \\n\r\nFIGHT ME MAI AND REINA LOVERS  !\u033f\u033f \u033f\u033f \u033f\u033f \u033f'\u033f'\\\u0335\u0347\u033f\u033f\\\u0437= ( \u2580 \u035c\u035e\u0296\u2580) =\u03b5/\u0335\u0347\u033f\u033f/\u2019\u033f\u2019\u033f \u033f \u033f\u033f \u033f\u033f \u033f\u033f",

            "content": "Musaigen no Phantom World (aka Musaigen) was pretty much universally hated for some reason, even acheiving the great status of being the worst rated KyoAni show on MAL. Which is a shame, because it wasn't that bad at all. \r\nMusaigen is about a kid (Haruhiko) who knows a lot of useless info but is pretty weak physically, along with his side kicks (who are all female). They all have special powers and are able to see figments of human imagination, which can affect physical objects and living things after an accident with a company that was researching them. These special powers vary in power, andwhile he doesn't have a particularly powerful power it's above average, and they go around 'sealing' these 'Phantoms' before they become a big menace.\\n\\n\r\nThis is pretty much the entire series. They are part of a school club that rewards them for taking care of middle level to easy phantoms, and they get to earn some pocket money while helping out the police (who take care of the stronger phantoms). Each episode usualy deals with one phantom somehow messing with either the characters, or someone else who they help as part of their 'job'. Which isn't very bad at all, since it does this pretty well. There are episodes centered around each character, there's a decent amount of character development (for 13 episodes) and you grow to like most of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nGiven that there is one male main and 4 female main characters (5 if you count their weird mini fairy sidekick) there's a fair amount of fanservice. Which is usually ok, it's not too excessive, but sometimes can get annoying. An example would be the first episode, which was part of why everyone everywhere decided it was utter shit, and was sort of unfortunate for the series.\\n\\n\r\nBeing episodic, it still had an 'overarching story' during these, where they mention a few things that happened in past episodes and was hinted to be part of a wider plot. This culminates in the final episodes, provding sort of a story end for the series as a whole, and at least concludes it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very, very good. The designs were pretty decent, but what shines the most was the art for the special powers, which looked great. Explosions, energy waves, heck, even energy swrods were handled very well. Sound was pretty decent as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe main thing pulling the series down is simply its attempt at a final story and attempts at character building. The ending was sort of clich\u00e9 and honestly not very well done, and for a cast of 6 characters, there simply weren't enough episodes to flesh them all out, leading to all of them getting some development. Other than that the anime wasn't very bad at all; some parts were mediocre, some good, but overall it was a very decent series.\\n\\n\r\nMusaigen wasn't a very bad series at all, just had a lot of tropes and clich\u00e9s used before thrown in that seemed repetitive to the viewer who watches this sort of anime by the dozen. Ignoring the high hopes people apparently pin to KyoAni, this show wasn't by any means a masterpiece, but was still a fun watch.",

            "content": "Musaigen no Phantom World is another anime from the great Kyoto Animation, So does the great Kyoto Animation finally made a good anime again with this title ? No. This anime one of the most bland anime i have ever seen, its not bad but there's nothing special at all with this anime.\r\nThe story itself is all over the place, i cannot found any main plot that drive the anime along. It just filled with a tiny plot every episodes that didn't really effect other episodes. The worse thing is, they tease a mystery with a device that the main characters found in one ofthe episodes, but in the end that devices still didn't really make an impact at all in any of the plot.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episodes feels like a bullet points in a presentation. Every characters get their own \"character development\" episodes, a lot of anime do this too but the character usually keep developing even after they get their \"character development\" episodes. The \"character development\" episodes its just a way to introduce the personality of the characters to the audience. But in this anime, after they get the \"character development\" episodes, its like the anime forgot about their personality and they just change them just to fit the situation that the creator wants them to be in. For example, there's a character that is really reclusive suddenly trying to be seductive. It all just feel really unnatural and strange to me.\\n\\n\r\nThe action scene is decent, nothing to write home about and not that bad either. A lot of fights ended really quick and not epic at all. The main characters will get defeated once, after that with some luck and a really powerful combo they defeated the enemy, rinse and repeat. Even the ending battle use this formula. In the end, nearly all the fight scene feels a little dull to be watched. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy is hit and miss, even though mostly miss. There's only a few comedy scene that makes me smile, not laugh. Smile. The rest its just a dull and cringe worthy moment for me. There's also some ecchi scene for the first 3 or 4 episodes, after that the anime just go to a totally different direction all together and abandon all the ecchi scene. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is decent, the character design and the monster design is good enough and feels like it was made by a AAA production studio. The background music is either really bland or non existent at all, since i honestly  can't remember which scene that have background music. The only truly great thing that i can say the voices for Kurumi Kumamakura is really cute.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Musaigen no Phantom World is a bland anime that didn't really know the direction that they want to go, so they decided to go everywhere and try everything that they can. If they didn't know the direction to go, how can the audience know how to follow it ? Is it worth your time ? No. There's a lot greater anime with similar plot that is better than this anime.",

            "content": "You know, if this was done by another studio, I would have dropped this show in an instant. Since this was made by Kyoto Animation and I admit, I'm a big KyoAni fag.....I mean fan, I decided to watch all 13 episodes. After 13 weeks of watching this show, I'd like to send a personal note to the studio and it's going to say something like this:\r\n\"What in God's name happened to you KyoAni?!!\" \r\n[Story]: (2/10)\r\n\"You can't believe everything you see, or can't see, for that matter.\"\r\nPhantoms, beings that blur the line between illusion and reality, wander around right under the noses of unsuspecting humans.Their origins are mysterious and few can see them. That is, until a research facility bombing spreads a virus that gave \"birth\" to what we now know as \"Phantoms\". Humans with special powers are given the task of sealing the trouble-making Phantoms.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, when I first read the synopsis, I thought KyoAni would finally produce a dark and serious anime. But alas, Phantom World teaches me to never hope for a serious and dark story from Kyoto Animation. I just gotta accept the fact that the last dark and serious story that I'll ever get from that studio is \"The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya\" which remains to be their best work the studio has ever done.\\n\\n\r\nWelp, time to review the story.....Wait a minute? Reviewing Phantom World's story? What story? The synopsis led me to believe that Phantom world will at least have an exciting story but this show doesn't even have a single ounce of story. Phantom World is basically an episodic show. Each episode, a Phantom stirs trouble and Haruhiro and the girls (or one of the girls alone Haruhiro) will take down the Phantom and save the day. That's what literally happened in Ep. 1 - 11. The first half of the series are just a bunch of character introductions. We get to see their personalities, their abilities and what you should expect from these characters. In the second half, it's pretty much what I said above. Phantom causes trouble and the characters take down the Phantoms. \\n\\n\r\nFrom Ep. 12-13, we finally get a mini story arc that was actually serious and has an actual antagonist explaining why he/she is doing whatever the hell he/she is doing to the city and it got something to do with the synopsis' first paragraph. The short story arc was actually pretty good. It had an actual story, even though the story was short and the characters were suddenly serious and not annoying, Hell, even Ruru wasn't annoying. Too bad this wasn't enough to save the show. \\n\\n\r\nThere is an explanation as to why the majority of the series was like a slice-of-life and Ep 12 suddenly introduced a serious story. Appearantly, it isn't until Volume 2 where the story turns dark and serious and majority of the show is adapted from Volume 1 which explains the slice-of-life aspect of the series. If this was a 2 cour series then Phantom World would turn out a lot better. \\n\\n\r\nRanting aside, I did enjoy the show. How did I enjoy this show you ask? Simple, I switched my perspective when I realized that Phantom World will not have a story arc and will instead, be a random episodic show. Since I also watch a lot of slice of life shows, I looked at this show from a SoL viewpoint and I ended up enjoying the show much more than I expected. The comedy aspect is there and the characters are surprisingly enjoyable to watch. This show was basically a time-killer for me. A show where I can turn my brain off and relax. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (10/10)\\n\r\nAs usual, Kyoto Animation produces one of the best animation in the industry. Great art, Great character designs, the lighting is amazing, the background is well-drawn, and the animation is very smooth and consistent. Just think of Hibike Euphonium except the character's faces aren't blushing all the time. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (10/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was simply amazing!! Kyoto Animation did a shitty job on Phantom World's \"non-existent\" storyline but on the other hand, they did an outstanding job on the show's Battle scene's OST.  Especially that battle theme that plays when the characters are about to do their special moves. I wish I could post a video where the battle theme is playing because explaining it won't do justice to the show's soundtrack. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"Naked Dive\" by SCREEN mode and the ED theme song is \"Junshin Always\" by Azusa Tadokoro. Ever since I heard the OP theme song, I've been listening to it non-spot because it's catchy as hell and there was that one scene in the OP Animation where the loli was dancing while holding her teddy bear in the cutest way possible. I'm not a lolicon but I have to admit, the loli dancing caught my.........heart. I also love the ED theme song because it's catchy and the singer's voice is beautiful. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (6.5/10)\\n\r\nHaha, man..KyoAni managed to put every cliched and cute characters that you could ever think of in a single show. There's a generic male protagonist, a big-boobed senpai, a flat chested girl, a girl who has trouble socializing, a fu**king loli, an annoying fairy and a friendly/helpful teacher. The only logical reason why you and I watched this show in the first place (and somehow enjoyed it) is the characters. All the girls are cute, they all have a set of unique and cliched personalities that we have all seen before a million times but for whatever reason, we just keep coming back because we enjoy seeing these personalities (if they're done right) and the characters are hilarious when they're all together. Now, my thoughts on the main characters. \\n\\n\r\nFirst up, we have \"Mai Kawakami\" or what I'd like to call her \"Mayonnaise-sama\". I wouldn't be surprised if we get a mouse pad with a picture of Mai and her boobs used as a wrist support to satisfy all those horny Japanese males. Like her breasts are big as hell so you'll be seeing them bouncing all the time throughout the show even if you try to avoid looking. If you want to learn \"Boob Physics 101\", do watch the \"Limbo scene\" at the first episode because I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Her appearance aside, she's a complete tsundere and she does get a bit of character development at the late latter half of the show. Also, to no surprise, she gains feelings for the protagonist, though she didn't gain feelings for him randomly. A cute big-boobed tsundere = 100% \"pure\" waifu material. \\n\\n\r\nNext up, we have \"Reina Izumi\". A flat-chested innocent girl who eats a lot of food but for whatever reason, she just doesn't gain any weight. Her ability is to literally suck up the Phantoms and that explains why she eats an abundance amount of food. Reina-chan is actually my most favourite character in the series simply because she's a flat-chested innocent girl who eats a lot of food. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's \"Koito Minase\" or what I'd like to call her \"Headphone-chan\". Headphone-chan is basically one of those emo girls who brushes off other people and prefers to not socialize. Honestly, she's the most boring character in the series and if you prefer anti-social girl types then you found her. \\n\\n\r\nThen there's \"Kurumi\", a loli that serves no goddamn purpose in the show whatsoever. I mean, why does she, an elementary schooler, hang around with a bunch of high school students? What purpose does she serve within the group or the show? Honestly, I feel like her only purpose in the show is to satisfy the pedophiles and to back up what I just said, Kurumi is an anime-original character and she does not exist in the LN's.........Yep.....\\n\r\nWell, that and to show us that she ain't a \"useless\" kid. She has that \"Albrecht(o)\" bear that fights alongside her and also to make her even more cuter. Nah, I lied..she's a useless kid. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, there's the protagonist Haruhiko and that fairy girl that hangs around him all the time \"Ruru\". Haruhiko is like the weakest protagonist I've ever seen. The only time that he's ever strong is if he has that booklet or that final fight scene at the end of the series. Did I also tell you that he's also a generic protagonist? Oh right, I already did.. Ruru, on the other hand, is a likable character for me. Some, if not most, people might find her annoying but not me. I find her hilarious and there was that one episode in the late 2nd half that made her somewhat of a better character.\\n\\n\r\nIn the first half, each episode was dedicated to Haruhiko and at least one of the female characters. For example, Haruhiko and Mai and the next episode, it's Haruhiko and Reina and etc. This basically gave the show a chance to give them a bit of character development. It's not much though. It's just basics like you learn why Koito is an anti-social or why Reina is acting the way she is. The 2nd half also developed Haruhiko and Mai's character but again, not that much. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (7.8/10)\\n\r\nEven though the story was pretty much non-existent, I still enjoyed the show. Phantom World was more of a \"turn your brain off\" kind of anime for me and also a time killer. I just didn't take it seriously and at the end, I wasn't as mad at the show as I was expecting to be.\\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"Myriad Colors Phantom World\" may have been an enjoyable anime to me but I'm disappointed to say that this is now Kyoto Animation's worst anime ever. The story was basically non-existent and the only aspect this show has its going is it's characters and the animation/soundtracks. Though, the characters will vary because not everyone will enjoy the characters like I did. If you look at this show from a slice-of-life point of view then you might enjoy this series. However, if you're expecting a serious story similar to the synopsis then it's better if you skip this show.     \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (6.8/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Enjoyable series when you look at it from a slice-of-life point of view\\n\r\n+Outstanding Animation\\n\r\n+Amazing Soundtrack + Great OP and ED theme songs\\n\r\n+All of the character may be cliched as hell but they're still enjoyable to watch\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Non-Existent Storyline\\n\r\n-A lot of Fanservice scenes and that Limbo Scene\\n\r\n-Too Much Mai Boobs\\n\r\n-Kurumi serves no purpose in the show other than to satisfy the pedophiles\\n\r\n-A bit of character development but there's not a lot\\n",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nMy brother, while he was growing up, had an imaginary friend: Ghost Friend. Not so imaginative.\r\nI never had one myself, but my brother always made sure Ghost Friend was around. Playing outside, eating at the dinner table, and sitting around the house. They were inseparable.\r\nAt some point, though, my brother no longer had Ghost Friend with him. I am not saying he stopped believing because that is not what happened. What happened was that Ghost Friend took a \u201cpermanent vacation\u201d elsewhere. Nobody knows where. He just went away to live his own life (which isweird wording for the supernatural).\\n\\n\r\nMusaigen no Phantom World (Phantom World for short) does not have Ghost Friend, but it does have a myriad of ghostly creatures. They come together to create quite the toss-up of an anime.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nPhantom World may seem to imply that the tales it tells are scary. Phantoms are, after all, usually spooky in nature.Phantom World does have pinches of scariness, but, for the most part, the anime looks to provide a pleasant time.\\n\\n\r\nTo this end, the narrative is largely comprised of slice-of-life material. One episode follows the group helping out the drama club on its quest for stage stardom. Another episode has the girls trekking through a haunted mansion to find the source of their catlike curse. Another still has them dealing with a UFO that annoys the women of a college dorm.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the anime is not always a happy experience. Indeed, many parts of the show have a melancholic undertone. Episode eleven has the best example. Mai must babysit Haruhiko. It\u2019s not the Phantom or the peculiar situation or even the letter that make the episode. It\u2019s the elongated scene at night, where Mai comforts Haruhiko through empathy, that demonstrates Phantom World\u2019s capability to create heartfelt moments through saddened scenarios.\\n\\n\r\nBut what about the Phantoms themselves? For the most part, they are some combination of goofy and dangerous. At times, seemingly little more than one-off plot points. But they harbor a theme that is found not just here in the narrative but also in the art and in the characters: isolation.\\n\\n\r\nMany (not all) of the Phantoms manifest from feelings of neglect. The electric poles in the beginning danced for themselves because nobody else did. The bunny mother and bunny father wanted a daughter of their own. The giant, pink monkey in the sauna at school had his wife leave him.\\n\\n\r\nA common thread exists between these \u201cnonexistent\u201d manifestations. But what ties them all together is their representation. The anime does not go into deep detail, but it is believed that Phantoms are hallucinations, born from one\u2019s own imagination.\\n\\n\r\nThat is, they\u2019re man-made creations.\\n\\n\r\nPhantoms are thoughts plucked from people\u2019s brains. Thoughts born from darker depths. A lot of power is stored in the idea that these Phantoms, who are seemingly unreal, highlight these very real, very human, feelings.\\n\\n\r\nThe most impressive aspect, though, is how the cast deals with these Phantoms. Yes, they punch them up or eat them whole from time to time. But to get to that point, they usually do so through non-combative means. Those poles are defeated with dance. The bunnies are beat with persuasion. The monkey is sated with accompaniment.\\n\\n\r\nA grander theme on isolation and togetherness exists beneath the chaff\\n\r\nTo put it differently, the Phantoms lose to togetherness. Camaraderie. Understanding. Love. From the drama club to the gargantuan cat to even the final boss, what ultimately saves the day is not a kick to the face but a kind gesture towards another.\\n\\n\r\nDefeating the Phantoms is more than just getting rid of them or helping them out, though. It also has the implication that isolation is not a permanent state. That it is possible to find comfort, safety, or happiness with others no matter how dire the situation.\\n\\n\r\nThis dichotomy even hearkens back to the narrative\u2019s structural dichotomy of slice-of-life and melancholy. Those happy times are made when others are around and vice versa.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so Phantom World\u2019s main message forms: togetherness supersedes loneliness.\\n\\n\r\nThis somewhat intricate parallelism is not readily seen because it is unfortunately hidden behind many a problem in the other areas of the narrative.\\n\\n\r\nTrouble begins on that structural level. Since almost none of the different episodes play off each other, it makes each outcome feel inconsequential. Worse still, the anime tries to include an overarching plotline, but it\u2019s so minimal in its impact that it fails to be meaningful to the scenes at large.\\n\\n\r\nAttempts at romance and action take damage, too. Romantically, the girls rarely show signs of affection. As for the action, the abilities lack importance since some almost never seem to work (Koito\u2019s scream), are used for niche purposes (Reina\u2019s swallow), or do not even stem from the characters themselves (Haruhiko and Kurumi let their summons do the fighting).\\n\\n\r\nEven Phantom World\u2019s ecchi material has problems. Mainly in that it does not feel appropriate to the tale at hand. Reina seductively sucking on a finger or Mai having her butt painted are certainly alluring. But, for an anime that focuses on Phantoms and isolation, having Mai inadvertently grope herself while powering up serves very little purpose.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, the narrative does have a deeper side to it. But in order to reach this depth, a lot of shoddiness has to be waded through first.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nPhantom World carries its main theme into its art. But it\u2019s best experienced rather than explained (but it is worth pointing out anyway): isolation. As the characters move about the world they are in, they seem separate from it. Be it at school or in the city, hardly any other students or people cross their paths. It comes off as isolated and unnatural \u2013 much like the Phantoms themselves.\\n\\n\r\nAt a more general level, the anime does well. While the fights do not last long, the animation remains high. Mai jumps, punches, and kicks as the elements surround her. Haruhiko\u2019s summons bark and entangle. And Reina gobbles up their foes with a spaghetti spectacle. Downtime sees the same level of quality with deft eye, hair, and facial movements that make the characters feel alive. Similar attention to detail can be seen with the Phantoms.\\n\\n\r\nArt likewise sees elevated attention. Backgrounds are realistic in their portrayal and detailed in their presentation. Lighting paints the field of view. And the myriad colors (easy wordplay intended) used throughout make the anime pop.\\n\\n\r\nMai\u2019s design highlights the strength of the overall art\\n\r\nThough the best part of the art comes from the character designs. They have a lot of detail: individual strands of air, crinkled clothing, and so on. Color symbolism also exists: Mai has yellow for happiness, Koito has red for anger, and so on. Standard connections, but they add another layer to the designs nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at their designs more closely, they continue to stand tall. Mai\u2019s side ponytail, large bust, and purple eyes (with both public and private beauty spots) skyrocket her attractiveness. Reina\u2019s long, black hair and thin frame bolster her cuteness. And Koito\u2019s short red hair, alongside her tie and large headphones, make her into the tomboy of the team.\\n\\n\r\n(Truthfully, Kurumi\u2019s frontal hairdo is a bit silly.)\\n\\n\r\nRuru gets a special shout-out. Not for her red-genie clothes or her teal hair that ends in a giant ball. Instead, her shout-out is for constantly changing forms throughout the season. From an old man with hemorrhoids to donning a bear costume, her outfit switches made it apparent just how focused on fun she truly was.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nWhile the art is arguably the strongest aspect of Phantom World, the cast does have strength of their own. Strength seen through the parallels and themes on an individual and group basis. But, even more so than with the story, it is difficult to find.\\n\\n\r\nStarting individually, Mai receives the most attention from the anime. Using hand-to-hand combat, Mai takes the fights to the Phantoms directly. She channels different parts of her body to infuse her fists with the elements \u2013 fire, water, and so on \u2013 in order to amplify her damage output.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the audience learns is that her combative attitude existed even when she was a child (much to her astonishment). She later empathizes with Haruhiko when she hears that he (similar to her) did not have a mother in his life, becoming just that for him.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on, Reina, a kind girl, has the ability to eat Phantoms. By doing so, she defeats the apparitions, making her a valuable asset to the team.\\n\\n\r\nFor her, at-home troubles make life difficult as a set of strict parents hound her. More so than ever since her older sister (their eldest daughter) left the household. Her wanting a loving home nets her in a precarious situation where she must choose between the ideal and the real. Luckily, she chooses the latter when she realizes (thanks to Haruhiko) that she means a lot to those that love her. Namely, her parents, her sister, and her closest friends.\\n\\n\r\nNext comes Koito. She is lauded as one of the more powerful ability users. She controls her voice to emit tuned waves that damage and seal harmful Phantoms.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, her strength was also her weakness. The people around her \u2013 from her fellow students to her teachers to even her parents \u2013 were afraid of the power she held. To the point that she \u201cshut herself off\u201d as Phantom World puts it. In other words, she\u2019s lonely. Her loneliness explained her do-it-herself mentality as well as her tendency to act icy towards others.\\n\\n\r\nKurumi, on the other hand, is an elementary school student whose cuteness defines her. That, and her toy-bear-turned-behemoth named Albrecht who fights for her when she calls upon him.\\n\\n\r\nHer episode showcases this strangeness to an elevated degree when she and Haruhiko are brought into a fantastical land within her own mind. The reason for her attachment to Albrecht and for her apparent escapism stems from a lack of self-esteem. Because she\u2019s a kid, because she feels as though she\u2019s useless, she does not have confidence in herself. Hence, she saves them from the dreamscape through recompense for Albrecht, giving her the wherewithal to believe in her own capabilities.\\n\\n\r\nRuru also gets an episode all to herself. The energetic Phantom that follows Haruhiko around finds herself wishing to be human \u2013 a wish she gets granted. But as she discovers, she\u2019s a wanted member of the group exactly as she is. Small or otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Haruhiko, he is a bookworm. Besides having knowledge of many different topics, he draws, using his pictures to both create and seal Phantoms. Later on, his abilities get the group into massive trouble with Enigma, the rogue and experimented-on enemy.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of his character revolves around the separation of his parents. More specifically, the lack of a mother in his life. He connects with Mai when she acts as his mother. He persuades Reina away from joining the Phantoms when he empathizes with her situation. And the arrival of his \u201cmother\u201d makes him happier than he\u2019s ever been.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are weak individually but support one another\\n\r\nLooking at the cast in this individual fashion, they come off as rather weak. Phantom World did what it could \u2013 setting aside one episode per character \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t feel like enough. Hardly anything comes of the developments the characters receive, and most of the time the developments are hardly investigated any further following their specific episode.\\n\\n\r\nAt the minimum, each cast member\u2019s ability has both contrasting and parallel qualities to them.\\n\\n\r\nMai fights with fists, matching her in-your-face personality yet not matching her loving tenderness.\\n\\n\r\nReina devours Phantoms similar to how she consumes food and dissimilar to her respectful nature.\\n\\n\r\nKoito sings forth power as she listens to her music and as she remains not very vocal.\\n\\n\r\nKurumi\u2019s giant bear guardian accentuates her tininess and highlights her massive courage.\\n\\n\r\nRuru being a Phantom goes along with her eccentric self and goes against her inclusion among her human friends.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Haruhiko draws, drawing on his vast knowledge of facts to create creatures of fiction.\\n\\n\r\nOn a group basis, Haruhiko and crew find more strength than they do individually. Initially, the major theme threading them together appears to be that of family. After all, parents play a part in nearly every character\u2019s backstory.\\n\\n\r\nFamily, however, is not quite the focus. It\u2019s more broad than that. Instead, it\u2019s about supporting or helping each other when others (e.g., family) won\u2019t. Mai, Reina, Koito, Kurumi, Ruru, and Haruhiko are a tight team not just because they complement one another well but also because they support one another when people in their lives won\u2019t. Mai and Haruhiko go without mothers, Reina goes without a sister, Koito goes without anybody, Kurumi mostly has her stuffed animal, and Ruru only has Haruhiko.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, they are a family for each other, connecting back to that theme on togetherness.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, they do not reach that level. For while they do support one another, they rarely interact with one another. Reina throws Haruhiko sometimes. Mai and Koito butt heads every so often. But, for the most part, they do not do much with, for, or between themselves. It makes their group dynamic feel weak. As though they are not so much a group of friends, let alone a family, but merely a club that just-so-happened to come together due to peculiar circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nIt also would have been nice if their teacher would have had a slightly bigger role to play. But that is a small gripe compared to the larger inadequacies of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track is quite peppy, using a fast beat, techno sound-effects, and both regular singing and rapping. The beginning and ending, when the instruments do more work than in the middle, are the stronger portions. It\u2019s technically a happy song, and it fits the show well, but it\u2019s not one worth listening to outside of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track takes the happy route as well, but it cranks it up even more so. While the rock band supports the song nicely with drums and guitar, the vocalist comes out on top. Her control and different pacing throughout the piece make the song better than it should be. The multiple-singers near the end helps, too. Again, like the OP, the song is fitting but not necessarily a worthwhile one.\\n\\n\r\nMs. Tadokoro as Ruru gives the \u201cfake\u201d character lots of life and energy\\n\r\nWhile the rest of the original soundtrack does not have many stand-out pieces, many are well-composed, forming tunes inspired by fast battles, circus romps, and cultural originations. \u201cFan Tom World He Youkoso\u201d (besides having a funny translation) makes the mood mysterious. \u201cSowasowa\u2026\u201d sounds both serious and not. And \u201cSoredemo Ashitahe\u201d is bittersweet throughout. A nice OST, ending up stronger than its OP and ED counterparts.\\n\\n\r\nPhantom World\u2019s voice acting performances are of a similar quality. The entire main cast did well, but a couple of them more so than the rest. Most notable are Misaki Kuno as Kurumi (who produced an undeniably cute voice) and Azusa Tadokoro as Ruru (whose energy and teasing could be heard at all times).\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThis one is a little all over the place for me in terms of entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nOn the low end, I don\u2019t much care for many of the cast members. Reina is innocent and I like her Haruhiko-tossing gag, but she lacks impact and intrigue. Koito is cool, but half the time she barely contributed to the festivities. Kurumi is cute, but Albrecht overshadows her (figuratively and literally).\\n\\n\r\nHaruhiko is a small step up if only because he gave many factoids that I have never heard before. I wish he was a bit more competent, and I was not moved by his reunion with his mother. But he still had more presence than the others.\\n\\n\r\nAt the high end, Mai and Ruru are very fun. Mai\u2019s attractiveness and ecchi moments are a plus, but I like seeing her as the kindhearted, mature person that she can be. Ruru is big ball of excitement and hilarity that (almost) always made the situations as lighthearted and comedic as possible.\\n\\n\r\nNot a whole lot of funny characters or scenes are had, but they are there\\n\r\nThinking back to the episodes\u2019 events themselves, again, a lot of hit-or-miss is had. Reina\u2019s episode with the bunnies and Koito\u2019s with the Phantom from her past (but not really) missed. Mai\u2019s episode with little Haruhiko hit. The rest fall somewhere in-between.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair, the comedy and cuteness were at least more consistent. Some scenes, like Mai bouncing her breasts beneath a limbo pole or the group defeating a Phantom because it couldn\u2019t turn around, were funny due to their silliness. And the different reaction faces were cute in their depictions. But both aspects were not enough to make the entire experience a grand one.\\n\\n\r\nMusaigen no Phantom World encounters a mishmash in terms of execution. Art and animation find strength as does the show\u2019s deeper theme on isolation. But the problems with the narrative, the lackluster cast, and the unengaging content hamper much of what it tries to do. This one will not be bringing Ghost Friend back from his vacation any time soon.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, a theme on togetherness and loneliness is hidden behind weak narrative elements\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, nice animation, art, and character designs alongside thematic isolation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, despite keeping with the theme of togetherness, the characters on both an individual and a group basis are just too weak\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, okay OP, okay ED, nice OST, and nice VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, a mixture of fun and boring characters with a mixture of fun and boring events\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "Myriad Problems Phantom Girls: A Myriad Colors Phantom World Review\r\nFrom the beginning, Myriad Colors Phantom World presents itself to be something that\u2019s not meant to be taken seriously. The show harbors a copious amount of overused tropes and cheeky moments of fanservice. While the fanservice often tries and succeeds in being fresh and original (like boob limbo), the tropes are only made somewhat less trope-y by a blunt act of self-awareness, an example being Haruhiko spouting exposition and Ruru acknowledging that he\u2019s going on and on about something the characters should already know, therefore solving the problem of boring exposition by pointing out that it\u2019sboring exposition, rather than just changing it to be more engaging. \\n\\n\r\nThe way Myriad Colors Phantom World introduces its characters is fairly simple, giving each girl an episode where they deal with some sort of Phantom that inadvertently reveals an inner struggle that is resolved happily and lightly referenced from here on out with no actual significance in the long haul. In the end all you really need to know about these characters are their quirks and powers. Other than that, they will be used in whatever way any future situations see fit.  \\n\\n\r\nAfter the group is fully formed the show becomes a Phantom of the Week wacky sitcom. This gives it an opportunity to explore a variety of themes without being confined by a cohesive narrative. This is what Phantom World excels at, as it doesn\u2019t seem to know what it wants or where it\u2019s going with the overarching plot. Episodes range from charming to bombastically funny to genuinely heartwarming. This all keeps to an episode structure that Phantom World can\u2019t seem to stray away from, where every episode needs to end with an action-y climax caused by some sort of Phantom, no matter how out of place it may be. \\n\\n\r\nThe show goes on like this until the last two episodes, because cliffhangers are absolutely essential to creating a worthwhile finale (sarcasm). This is where the show finally falls off the tightrope it has been treading on since the very beginning, the fine line between derivative and self-aware derivative. Without spoilers, Phantom World ends in an incredibly generic, final fight way, and it\u2019s very disappointing considering the much more enjoyable approach the show had been taking three episodes ago. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, they\u2019re all fairly likable with the exception of Haruhiko, our main male protagonist who is a bland, nice guy know it all that until the very end only serves as an exposition device that nobody likes. Minase is established as a group member pretty poorly, as the show acknowledges later on by Mai saying \u201cYou know, I hadn\u2019t even noticed that you\u2019d joined our team.\u201d That being said, she\u2019s a cool loner type character that is exceptionally skilled in the field of Phantom hunting, all while being socially awkward! Then there\u2019s Izumi, who eats a lot and is cute. Oh, and Kurumi who is also cute and has a teddy bear. Finally, there\u2019s Mai, who is a spunky athletic student with big boobs. \\n\\n\r\nThe Things It Does Well\\n\\n\r\nMyriad Colors Phantom World knows how generic it is and openly admits it rather than trying to subvert it, which sometimes results in moments of genuine originality and humor. And despite its generic plot, the show always remains visually engaging, with excellent action sequences and stunning scenery, the clipping was done in a way that never let a still frame sit for too long. At its best, Myriad Colors Phantom World is a legitimately funny sitcom with a mostly likeable cast in a world with very little rules to abide by, creating an endless amount of possible wacky misadventures.\\n\\n\r\nThe Things It Doesn\u2019t Do Well\\n\\n\r\nWhile Phantom World does try to give attention to every trope it uses, some just come through as utterly generic and uninteresting, like in the final episode. The show doesn\u2019t seem to know where it\u2019s going and emotional plot points feel incredibly phoned in. It even toys with the idea of a harem, but just like many of its other tropes, the show fails to fully commit, leaving nothing but a few laughs and a feeling of wasted time. At its worst, Myriad Colors Phantom World is a generic magical action show that pretends to not be generic by showing it\u2019s aware of how generic it is and doing it anyway.\\n\\n\r\n(Note: Review is also posted on my blog, this is not plagiarized)",

            "content": "The word I've been hearing about Phantom World is that the KyoAni fans set it on fire whilst the KyoAni haters took their word for it and used their cries as fuel to light an even bigger fire. And after sitting through the whole thing, the only feeling I have regarding the overall reaction is confusion. Seriously guys, this show isn't that bad. It's not all that good, but almost none of the complaints I've heard tossed in its direction are really valid. I mean what smug self-awareness? What excessive fanservice? What exactly is supposed to be awful about this show that you couldn't alsosay about Konosuba and Dagashi Kashi? Is it the fact that until the little kid showed up, there wasn't enough moe to tide you guys?\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I'm pretty sure it was the first two or so episodes that pretty much dug the show's grave because they did have bad meta humor and stupid sexualization jokes - although the reaction to them was so overblown I couldn't be bothered to look at the stupid nicknames people gave. If the initial (very low) scores for Classroom Crisis, Punch Line, and Concrete Revolutio have shown anything, it's that anime fans are very unforgiving of poor first impressions, along with the fact that they are very forgiving when you make a good first impression even when the rest of the show is shit...unless your name is Coppelion I mean. And \"KyoAni light novel adaptation\" has sort of become a curse word in fandom these days, so no one was really willing to give the show a chance from the very start besides naive diehards and...there's no \"and\" after that. Of course, it would have helped if the start of your show was actually indicative of the rest of said show because it feels like the first two episodes and the remaining eleven were made by completely different writing teams. Maybe there was some muppets-like change in staff during pre-production but they didn't have enough time to rewrite the premiere or something.\\n\\n\r\nPhantom World is KyoAni's second attempt at writing a Rumiko Takahashi-like gag anime based on a light novel in that it takes place in a seemingly normal school setting that just so happens to house the supernatural after some scientific nonsense involving the human senses that I'm pretty sure our main lead, Haruhiko Ichijou, pulled out of his ass happened more than a decade ago. For the most part, each episode follows a certain formula. At the beginning of every episode, Haruhiko will give an annoying speech about Japanese culture/high philosophy and how it relates to the episodic scenario at hand whilst his flying phantom tag-along, Ruru, does some \"hilarious\" side commentary on the side. After that, a phantom shows up to cause trouble for Haruhiko and his female (and only female, unless you count the giant teddy bear) friends. A mixture of character humor and feels occur, usually ending in the phantom's defeat. And depending on the episode, the final few minutes will either depict our characters feeling happy about themselves or getting screwed by a last-minute twist that will be ignored come next week.\\n\\n\r\nNow I said Phantom World reminds me of Urusei Yatsura, but to be more precise, it reminds me of that show's more serious side rather than its comedic side. Only a handful of the episodes go for straight-up gag plots, whilst the majority of them resemble episodes like when Lum travelled different dimensions to find the real Ataru or when Ataru's mother has a weird psychedelic \"Mamoru Oshii-style\" dream after a mall accident. Basically, they're self-contained character episodes that try to make you feel for the cast whilst keeping its light-hearted tone the entire way through so that you can laugh at the absurdity of our main character being trapped in a world of talking teddy bears whilst feeling sad when said teddy bear gets wounded in battle and the little kid character gathers her courage in the form of a magical girl uniform in order to fight off a giant bear mecha. And considering this is a KyoAni anime, the animation is good for the most part, with the studio even splurging a bit on the atmospheric set pieces here. From the aforementioned teddy bear world to the giant cat who looks like he came from Howl's Moving Castle to that weird dream world of bunnies where toilets are apparently considered portals to another dimension in Japanese folklore, I guess KyoAni learned from Chuunibyou that you don't have to take yourself too seriously to convey feels.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like about Phantom World's humor over, say, Osomatsu-san's or Active Raid's is that there's almost no self-awareness at all in either the direction or the characters - again, a stark contrast to the show's initial episodes which was nothing but bad self-aware meta humor. Seriously, I have no idea why those first two episodes even exist (besides introducing the characters I mean) if the rest if the show wasn't going to follow their formula. But even when the show aims for a more gag-related plot during its later installments, it always puts on a straight face whilst delivering the jokes, allowing for some actual fucking irony to show up and make things funny. It also helps that without Amagi's lackluster overarching narrative burdening things and the comedic timing being as quick and energetic as Cats Don't Dance's (no gags that get drawn out far past the point where the humor is lost. It's a miracle!), Phantom World is able to execute its mixture of humor and character drama fairly evenly without either side dominating the other.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the show falters, besides its crappy start I mean, is that the characters are stereotypes. It'll take too long to explain why, but besides the comedic situations that they're put into, there's not really much to them, which I think is the main reason why I never found this show as funny or engaging as Urusei Yatsura even at its best. The cast of Yatsura may not be the most sophisticated bunch, but there character traits are inherently ironic by nature (ex. Lum is a sweet-tempered naive girl who'll nevertheless put her man in place with electric shocks), whereas Mai is just a tsundere girl with big boobs who's good at fighting and has a low opinion of her only male friend. And if you don't like the humor, then you're not going to appreciate the character drama either, because it never grows beyond the quality expected of a Disney Afternoon show and certainly doesn't compare to more current \"comedic cartoons\" like Steven Universe or Gravity Falls. There's a reason a good chunk of this show's watchers prefer episodes where Haruhiko is turned into a kid whilst not being so kind to the episode when Ruru is given a human body, is all I'm saying.\\n\\n\r\nIt also doesn't help that the show falls under that stupid \"let's get serious for the final act\" syndrome most light novel/gag anime go through. Without spoiling anything, the final two episodes introduce a new monster of the week in order to prey on Haruhiko's mother issues, but unlike when Ranma did in the 90s, it's incredibly rushed, takes itself too seriously compared to Phantom World's usual \"serious\" tone, and what little gags do show up in those episodes are nothing more than cheap stuff that acknowledges its light novel roots without actually doing anything with them, which wasn't funny when Konosuba did it either. So basically, you've got a show where the first two episodes and the last two episodes are pure crap, whilst the remaining nine...well they're not exactly gold, but they never dip below bronze level and I'd say the amount of silver amongst them combined with the lack of real continuity keeps the show afloat enough to the point where I didn't leave disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as LN adaptations/KyoAni stuff goes, Phantom World is a functional gag anime you can tolerate whilst waiting for the Euphonium sequel to blow your mind. It's nothing you should go back and give another try now that the season is winding down if you're one of the many who dropped it early on, but being ranked lower than fucking Undefeated Bahamut Chronicles whilst airing is just irrational no matter how you look at it guys. Seriously, how on earth did it score lower than that mess? But anyways, as long as you don't take the show's drama too seriously and start at Episode 3 since it's not really the kind of show where you have to see every episode, you'll probably have a fun time - as well as more proof that you should never hang out in anime communities if you value your free time.",

            "content": "WARNING. This show contains:\r\nFanservice\r\nHigh School setting\r\nSlapstick violence as \u201chumor\u201d\r\nAccidental perversion\r\nViolent, big boobed female main character\r\nFanservice\r\nSpecial power only the MC has for\u2026 reasons\r\nSide character to create comedic relief\r\nSide character to fill the viewer in on what is going on\r\nSide character to create fanservice\r\nA loli\r\nOnly 1 male character\r\nLight Novel adaptation \r\nYou have been warned.\r\nMusaigen no Phantom World is your typical high school, battle harem type of show that\u2019s slowly taking over the industry. Shows like these are easy to spot, since all the female characters are in the foreground of the \u201cposter\u201d and the only male character in the background.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nAfter an incident that happened over adecade ago (which is never brought up again) some stuff happened in the human brain and they can see these phantoms\u2026 Yeah, that\u2019s really as far as the exposition goes.\\n\\n\r\nThe show takes place in a world where phantoms exist and are causing all kinds of mild annoyances. Not phantoms from another dimension that\u2019s planning to destroy the world, or some spiritual thingy majiggers planning to take over the world, but phantoms that take creep shots of girls, phantoms who block people from crossing a bridge and the occasional phantom brute that goes around and destroys lampposts.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a group of teenagers in high school, who are in the phantom hunting club. Their job/duty is to investigate and take care of reported incidents involving these phantoms. The reason that they even bother signing up for this and sometimes risk their lives when dealing with the phantoms is that they\u2019re being paid by the school for doing so. Not in money, but in different assets like rice or other edible substances.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a \u201cphantom of the week\u201d type of show so far. Each problem/phantom have been dealt with within a single episode and it looks like it isn\u2019t going to change.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is the only thing that I can complement in this show. Kyoto Animation is the studio behind the show and if you know who they are, you know what you can expect. If you don\u2019t know who they are, you can expect great animation and a perfectly designed color palette for this show. The scenery is really good, the fights are fluid and the animation and overall animation quality of the show is great.\\n\\n\r\nSound 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s nothing bad about it the music, but here\u2019s also nothing noteworthy to write about. The music is electronic\u2019ish sounding and fast paced. The sound effects when fighting are on point and timed okay, but that\u2019s all there really is to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening desperately tries to squeeze as much fanservice in as possible. Boob jiggles, up skirts, cosplays, under boobs and even fucking pixelated naked shots of each girl in the show! I mean, what the fuck are they thinking?!\\n\\n\r\nAnd the ending\u2026 The male MC isn\u2019t even in there. The ending is just another way to show of the girls.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 4/10\\n\\n\r\nOur (only) male main character (whose name isn\u2019t really that important) is introduced by the flying blob of fanservice, forcefully opening his eyelid and reminding him that he\u2019s running late. He is submissive to any and all violence thrown at him from his \u201cfriends\u201d and is weak, if it weren\u2019t for his one power. Well\u2026 Realistically speaking he\u2019s still pretty weak, even with his \u201cpower.\u201d His power is that if he draws the phantom they\u2019re fighting in a book, the book will then absorb the phantom and the danger will be gone. Except his power is completely redundant, since they have \u201cReina Izumi\u201d in the phantom hunting club.\\n\\n\r\nHis sole reason for being in the show, is because they need something YOU can project yourself onto. He\u2019s just there so you can think \u201cI wish that was me getting thrown out of the window for seeing a girl in a towel.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nOur first female main character \u201cMai Kawakami\u201d (you might want to google her name not too far into the future ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) ) is everything the male main character isn\u2019t. First and foremost, she is a girl. Secondly, she has big breasts. Thirdly, she knows martial arts and can fight, which makes her boobs jiggle (Can you see where I\u2019m going with this?) Her special ability is to power herself up with different elements (fire, water, electricity). She does that by fondling herself...\\n\r\nOther than that, she likes to physically torment the main male character for the sake of \u201ccomedy\u201d. She doesn\u2019t have any romantic interest in the MC, so her violent actions towards the MC can\u2019t be excused as a \u201cit\u2019s not like I like you or anything\u201d dropkick or a \u201cd-don\u2019t get the wrong idea\u201d punch in the face.\\n\\n\r\nOur second female main character \u201cReina Izumi\u201d (AKA Kirby) is the nonviolent and the \u201coh so innocent Ojou-sama\u201d part of the trio. Her special ability is to suck up/eat phantoms in an extravagant and Kirby way. She is the main victim of \u201caccidental perversion.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nShe is the character that I dislike the least. She has an actual reason for joining the phantom hunting club. Since she\u2019s living on her own and most of her money goes towards rent (let me remind you that she is a teenager) she can get food by dealing with the phantoms.\\n\\n\r\nThe third main character is introduced 3 episodes in. Her name is Koito Minase. The show plays her off as the \"cool kid\" archetype. She wears headphones, her hands are almost always in her pockets and has an overly long \u201cchant\u201d she has to say before activating her destructive and monotone voice, which she calls her \u201cpower.\u201d She also has a deep, dark and mysterious past, as the archetype typically has.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, there\u2019s the flying blob of fanservice Ruru. She is a phantom who sided with the MC for reasons that we don\u2019t know. She doesn\u2019t do anything action wise and adds nothing to the story besides fanservice, comedic relief and exposition.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s this particular scene that I enjoyed a bit, before the tropes and clich\u00e9s began to molest it. Picture this:\\n\\n\r\nMC tries to convince Reina to join their club. Reina walks away from MC, but trips on the stairs.\\n\r\nOur HERO! Our SAVIOUR! Our MC rushes down the stairs and is ready to shield her face from the concrete when he realizes that he\u2019s about to grab her boob. Our white knight makes a meta and 4th wall breaking statement before stopping the clich\u00e9 by grabbing his own hand and pulling it away, resulting in a faceplant.\\n\r\nThe flying blob of fanservice then breaks physics, lifts Reina over the MC and literally gives the MC a face full of ass. He manages to say that he did not see her panties (which were in fact blue striped, as shown in his eyes), before getting his ass kicked by Reina.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s like they\u2019re trying to be funny, only for it to turn out to be as generic as the ten thousand other shows that already did this.\\n\r\nI really want to enjoy the show, but it\u2019s really fucking hard to do, when everything about it screams HIGH SCHOOL BATTLE HAREM FANSERVICE!!!\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is okay, the show is very well animated and has the KyoAni look to it, but that is not nearly enough to save this show.\\n\\n\r\nA good chef can\u2019t make good food with shit ingredients. It\u2019s the same with KyoAni. They can\u2019t make a thoughtful and interesting show, if the source material is just another batch of copy paste shit that\u2019s clogging up the industry, like this morning\u2019s oatmeal that I forgot to take out of the sink.\\n\\n\r\n*Reposted because it got removed.*",

Imagine what an all-time Green lantern fan felt after watching the movie, or DC fans after watching Batman v Superman and Suicide squad. That's exactly what I felt. First, I saw the opening and was introduced the characters while I watched on&on. It was okay for about episode 3(Don't remember what the ep was about because it's been about half a year since I've seen it)\r\nThen, as I watched it through episode 13, I got bored and very confused. \r\nThe story flow is confusing, and the background story of thecharacters(An episode about the past of Izumi would have been nice) and their so-called 'phantoms' is poor. The story of each episode isn't that bad, but the connection between the episodes is very awkward. These drawbacks can be checked in ep13. The atmosphere suddenly changes, without any indication before, and new background info is hastily added in the last episode. It was very hard to take all that in the last episode. I  think they made ep13 that way considering the story for season 2, bit we all know that won't happen.\\n\r\nWell, it is made by Kyoto animation, so I really can't say anything about their artwork. .The OP and ED are` also good, maybe too good considering it's story. The characters aren't horrible, but they're not that appealing either. \\n\\n\r\noverall: remarkable artwork&songs, and not bad characters wasted on a cheap story that lacks background &  flow\\n\r\n           Kyoto animation should have made K-On season 3 with the budget used on this one.",

You then WANTto question what happened to the Plot, but you can't, because they continue with episodes that are Heartwarming, emotional, or straight up Sexy as Hell.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf anything the ending of Phantom World made my opinion of it go from a 7/10 to a 8.5/10, and the only reason I have it as a 10/10 is because it definitely deserves a higher score then some of the other Anime that appeared in the Winter 2016 season.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for something to watch that has Cute girls, will give you a lot of laughs, is easy on the eyes and is just an easy going anime, I'd recommend Musaigen no Phantom World.\\n\\n\r\nAs for whether or not I'd purchase the Blu Ray is still debatable.",

            "content": "Musaigen no Phantom World is an anime which could have been really, really good. Its premise had the potential to make this something memorable, and to have an actual plot. Sadly, it decided to throw this away in favour of episodic and unconnected episodes, cardboard characters, general harem clich\u00e9s and fanservice.\r\nAn unexplained event sometime before the anime starts resulted in people seeing aberrant creatures, known as \"Phantoms\". These phantoms range from harmless inanimate objects which have manifested themselves into personalities, to dangerous creatures capable of murdering dozens of people.\r\nGiven the potential danger these phantoms can pose, you would think that there would be a specialforce set up designed to banish these phantoms as soon as they appear - after all, having scores of people murdered by rampaging giant monsters is not exactly something desirable.\\n\r\nInstead, the story follows a group of high school students (it's always high school students..) who are training their powers in order to combat the phantoms. From right here you can see something doesn't add up - why would the defeat and capture of dangerous mythical creatures be left to the hands of emotional, untrained teenagers and kids? This particular side is never addressed. It's just seen as the norm for non-adults to take care of everything, whilst the teachers and other grown-ups just stand by at the sidelines, doing nothing but watching events unfold.\\n\\n\r\nThere's no real plot to speak of. Each episode starts up with Haruhiko breaking the 4th wall, telling the viewer what the episode is going to focus on and giving some trivia pertinent to the events about to unfold. It is entirely episodic, too. Each episode focuses on a different character - one episode about Mai, one episode about Reina, one episode about Koito; so on and so forth. There isn't any progression.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves don't really have any defining personalities. Haruhiko is just the regular MC. He occasionally helps out. He's a nice guy, lending aid to people whilst being beaten up and slapped by the members of his harem when the tired old tropes and clich\u00e9s appear, such as him tripping into someone's panties. \\n\r\nMai is one of the two primary focuses of the fanservice; she has to rub her tits and other parts of her body whilst chanting in order to activate her powers.\\n\r\n Ruru is a Phantom who exists purely for fanservice. She does nothing else. For instance, in one scene Mai and Haruhiko are talking. Rather than focus on the talk, the camera zooms in on Ruru and we simply watch her doing leg exercises, whilst the conversation carries on in the background.\\n\r\nKoito, Kurumi and Reina play the role of the kuudere, the loli and the shy one, respectively. \\n\r\nAll of the characters get an equal amount of screentime, and contribute an equal amount to the events that unfold. Each are given an episode in the spotlight which focuses on their problems and their past.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is the absolute high point for the series. Say whatever you will about the rest of this anime; the art cannot be faulted. Simply put, it is gorgeous. Even without the fanservice, it is nothing short of pure eye candy. The art is crisp, and the colours vivid. It makes it a pleasure to watch, even when one finds themselves uninterested in what's actually happening. The animation is top-notch, too. This is especially apparent where the phantoms are concerned. The effects used on them - such as the particles emanating from some of them, and the way they flicker as they move around - look awesome. You can tell a lot of effort has been put into it - nothing less expected of KyoAni.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a shame, then, that it is only the art and animation that has had a lot of effort put into it. Each episode consists merely of tropes, clich\u00e9s and all the regular things associated with fantasy highschool harem anime. If you're a fan of this particular genre, then you will probably enjoy Musaigen no Phantom World. It brings everything we've seen before, but with the art and animation cranked into overdrive. I will mention that the fanservice is reduced in the quantity in the later episodes. It is not nearly as prevalent as it was at the beginning.\\n\r\nBut if you're tired of the same old, then avoid this. There's nothing new about this. There's no particular reason to prioritise watching this over any other highschool harem.\\n\r\nI gave this a 4/10 overall. There was no real reason for me to feel invested or interested. If not for the amazing art I would have rated this lower. It isn't bad; it is merely uninspired. If nothing else, watching this was made easier when I stopped thinking about what was happening and merely enjoying the aesthetics.",

The actual story is pretty simple, following our main cast and their jobs involving the Phantoms.  Most episode were kind of like the \"monster of the week\" type of feel, with a couple cases where there were two-parters. These episodes also gave us the background on the characters, which is normal, but it also wasn't too forced. There is also some very useful information told in regardsto the human psyche, which is supposed to be one of the main themes of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were fun to watch, with good chemistry and enough screen time to make them worth caring about. For the most part, we focus on the main cast (secondary characters don't play any significance to the story). There was one character who, after the first episode, I thought I was not going to like because of their personality. However, after seeing an episode focusing on them, and learning more about them (as well as remembering their voice actor, to whom I'm a fan), they began to grow on me a bit.\\n\\n\r\nThere's not much I can about the animation, as Kyoto Animation (or KyoAni, for short) does yet another fantastic job.  They have a distinct look and feel where I can watch a series without prior knowledge on the studio behind it and can tell right away it's KyoAni.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I thoroughly enjoyed the series, there are some aspects that I feel should have been explained or fleshed out more, but for what's it's worth, it was all right. This would be a series I recommend, especially if you are a fan of KyoAni.",

Its mainly a comedy with fanservice and humor, so a typical harem, nothing special right?\r\nThe main problem with this is that there were so many expectations for this anime due to the synopsis sounded pretty neat. If it actually got rid off most of episodes 3-9 and made ones with actual plot this would have lived up to these expectations.\r\nHaving said that i did find it an enjoyable watch and watched the eps as theycame out not really complaining about it. It was a relaxing anime meant to be fun not edge of your seat binge watch stuff.\\n\\n\r\nPros :\\n\r\n- relaxing and gives a good laugh\\n\r\n- Mai senpai\\n\r\n- Plot picks up later in show\\n\r\n- Fanservice\\n\r\n- All the girls are enjoyable\\n\r\n- Another shipping war\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n- No real plot till late in the show\\n\r\n- Characters are cut and paste (might not be seen as bad)\\n\r\n- Another shipping war\\n\r\n- does not meet expectations in terms of story\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory : 5 - In terms of story i feel this is why a lot of people were let down by this anime. The synopsis sounds good and you expect a plot driven anime. However no plot really happens till episode 11 where the you actually might start to care about the MC and hint of plot actually happens. So story is a 5 simply because it did not deliver much story at all until very late but when it did instantly wanted more.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6 - like most recently of KyoAni the animation is good but nothing different from other works really.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6 - same explanation as sound.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7 - In terms of characters, for the first half you are only watching it for the girls as the MC has no character development. Most of the characters are cut and paste really. Only 4 characters out of around 10 you only really care about and have any kind of development at all. However the characters are enjoyable and the girls really carry the show till later in the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 - As many flaws and typical harem characteristics it has i really did enjoy it. The character interactions are funny and the story when it finally picks up bumps this enjoyment rating up.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7 - Due to the high expectations MnPW fails due to it being completely different to what was expected. However if you just want to relax and have a good laugh this is decent. If you want plot brave through to episode 11 or look somewhere else.",

Though, they happen to be a bit lifeless. KyoAni could bring up some good stuff with it though. (with MCs mum for example.

They were entertaining introductions to all the characters and I was pretty invested in what would come for the rest of the season. Unfortunately, what I was given, were disappointing episodic events where the main character just gets a one-on-one adventure with each of the girls. It was incredibly disappointing sitting through half the anime where nothing important happened. Past the introductions to the characters, you're really better off just skipping to episode twelve and watching the last two episodes, because that's where all the interesting stuff happens.\r\nThecharacters were pretty good. I liked the main character, which is often hard for me to say when it comes to harems, but he wasn't bad. Mai was okay, Koito had her moments, Usagiloli was adorable, and Reina was super cute. But beyond the outward appearance of the character, there wasn't really anything deeper to any of them. You saw them once, knew what they were about, and that's all you get for the entirety of the series.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the best thing about the show was the art. It really does look pretty great, but you can easily expect that from KyoAni. It was smooth, colorful, and just overall appealing.\\n\\n\r\nWould not recommend.

There were still moments I liked, but I definitely preferred the ending episodes. \r\nThus my overall feeling for this anime was that it was decent.

However, this shows that even the most respected studios can make mistakes, and this anime was definitely a mistake.\r\nStory - 3\r\nHaruhiko and his harem dispel unwanted phantoms in order to get better grades in their club. That's basically it. Sure, there are some interesting episodes, especially the last two episodes, however there is really no overarching story. This season is just compiled of short stories thatinvolve them fighting phantoms. There is hardly any tension from these episodes since they are in no real danger. All their encounters with phantoms are just jokes. Sadly, the last 2 episodes were good, since their was actually tension and a story, however two episodes isnt enough to save this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\\n\r\nThere really isn't much to say about the art and animation of the anime. Kyoto Animation is considered to be the best studio alongside Madhouse for a reason. This anime is beautifully animated, and the character designs are charming. Fight scenes are incredible, and probably the only reason why I would watch an episode every week. After seeing this anime, I think Kyoto Animation should do more action oriented anime because the action was amazing to watch. Some scenes are so beautifully drawn that it distracts me from the horrible plot of the episode that I was watching. If you are one of those people who want style over substance, then this is definitely one of the animes you need to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 5\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are one dimensional and boring. The most interesting character would definitely have to be Haruhiko because there are episodes that are dedicated to his background, and those episodes were good compared to the others. Mai is probably most famous for her limbo scene, and that is probably the only reason why she was in this anime. She is there only for fan service, and action. Reina is only there to be a possible love interest to Haruhiko. I have no clue as to why Koito was in the anime. There were some episodes dedicated to her character, but they contributed nothing to her character development other than the fact that she started blushing when Haruhiko would go close to her. There is also a loli character who is so unimportant that I forgot. The characters are what you would expect from a decent harem, however this series isn't aiming to be a harem.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5 \\n\\n\r\nSome episodes are interesting and funny, but the majority are dull and boring. Other than the occasional fight scenes, I do not enjoy watching this anime. I had no interest in watching the story unfold.\\n\\n\r\nOverall -  5\\n\\n\r\nThis series had potential. KyoAni was in charge, and the world of the anime is interesting. Fighting off phantoms could've been an interesting anime if the story was done right, and if the characters were more interesting. Sadly, this season only covers the first volume of the light novel, and apparently the next volumes are actually really good, and a lot of fans really want to see those volumes get animated, and I am interesting in seeing it as well. However, after finishing this season, i think it's best if KyoAni forgot about this series, and pretend like it never happened. This anime is the Incredible Hulk of KyoAni. By that i mean, this is probably their worst work, especially compared to the other animes they have worked on. Even if you are a fan of the studio, I think it's better off if you just watched cat videos on youtube, because at least those videos are somewhat funny.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Episode 1 was awful. But I gave episodes 2 and 3 a chance, and I stayed. In the end, I'll say the anime is pretty good, not amazing. It had it's fair share of problems no doubt, but I genuinely believe Musaigen no Phantom World had its moments that make it worth watching. Like episodes 10 and 11. \r\nThe characters, the world, the concept, the art and the animation are all pluses. The story has its ups and downs, and fan-service was used in a way that actually took away from some parts of the show. Fan-service in and of itself is fine, but whenboob physics need to be accounted for in the winning of limbo, unless the show is meant to be funny, perverted or both, it kind of takes the viewer out of the story.\\n\\n\r\nI will say, I would be giving it a 6/10, but the last 4 episodes earned another point out of me. Episode 11 in particular did use a cliche and stupid concept for an episode, but it was pulled it off impressively well. Episode 11 in particular I would give a 9/10. \\n\\n\r\nI'd say this one is worth watching, I wouldn't go too far out of my way to watch it or watch it over many others, but I don't regret watching it in any way. So if you're looking for a fun anime to watch while and don't have too terribly high standards at the moment, then sure, Musaigen no Phantom World is right for you.",

            "content": "When a studio as great as Kyoani has to resort to fan-service in the first episode in order to hook the viewer, you know that this show is going downhill pretty quickly.\r\nThis show begins like countless other LN adaptations, with some info-dumping expository dialogue (\u201cit\u2019s common knowledge, but I\u2019ll tell you anyway!\u201d quips the main character) telling us that there has been some major \u201cincident\u201d that has fundamentally changed the inner workings of the human brain, and now everyone can see possibly real, possibly imaginary \u201cPhantoms\u201d which provide much of the story complications throughout. I like the idea that there might be strange entities allaround us that we simply cannot perceive, but this premise already becomes problematic when we see that the Phantoms are capable of physically damaging and interacting with objects in the real world, which makes you wonder why no one has noticed them already even without the ability to see them. This premise raises more questions than it can answers, and you shouldn\u2019t expect any more elucidation on the backstory as it is suddenly brushed under the rug (cause the backstory really doesn\u2019t matter, right?) and we are hurriedly introduced to our main cast. We have Haruhiko, who is slightly better than your run-of-the-mill LN protagonist but that\u2019s not really saying much. He is much more tolerable than your standard LN protagonist as he spends very little time perving on girls and getting flustered, but instead we get to listen to him constantly drop useless titbits of knowledge throughout the series in a weak attempt to sell him as a \u2018smart\u2019 character. What could have been a totally tolerable character is spoiled by this obnoxious little detail which keeps cropping up in every single episode. An example of this is when the characters are searching for Phantom nicknamed \u201cEnigma\u201d. Haruhiko being Haruhiko, he chips in suddenly and explains the etymology of the word \u2018enigma\u2019 and also points out that it was also the name of a cipher machine developed in the Second World War. The real question here is, \u201cwho gives a fuck?\u201d None of this information is relevant to anything that happens in the episode and and none of the other characters asked him for this information. Expect this to happen literally dozens of times throughout the series. Not only this, but the entire intro of every episode consists of Haruhiko posing as a sensei for 2 or 3 minutes which is also supposed to convince us that he is an intelligent character (and to also blatantly explain the theme of the episode to the brain-dead target audience, but that\u2019s another matter). Here\u2019s a tip for LN writers: if you want to sell a supposedly intelligent character, have them do things that are actually intelligent! Since the plot of most of the episodes usually contains a hint of mystery, the author have could have easily sold him as a smart character by having him deduce the answer to the mystery before everybody else. But instead the author takes the easy way out and we are left with a perfect example of how a \u201csmart\u201d shouldn\u2019t be written.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters introduced are merely additions to Haruhiko\u2019s inevitable harem (cause who isn\u2019t turned on by a living trivia machine?) We have Mai Kawakami, whose literal first presence on the screen is a shot of her jiggling tits. Yeah, don\u2019t expect much depth out of this character. We also get Reina Izumi; whose only character traits are that she is soft-spoken and polite, she eats a lot and she likes the main character. Her character gets briefly interesting when it is discovered that she has some family issues going on, but this is only addressed for one episode and there is no real conclusion as to how she sorted all of that out.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest wasted potential is the character of Ruru, the comedic relief of the show. Though I do admit that her antics occasionally brought a smile to my face, it\u2019s painfully obvious that she could have been so much more than comedic relief. Ruru is a friendly Phantom, but the problem is that she is too much like the other characters, i.e, she is too human. This character could have been used effectively to provide a non-human entity\u2019s perspective of all the odd-going-ons in this show, which would have highlighted the fundamental differences between a Phantom and a human. But\u2026no. Ruru acts and reacts almost exactly like any another human despite being non-human in the first place, which feels lazy and uninspired. I didn\u2019t hate this character but the waste of potential is palpable. Also, at certain points in the series when the characters are pondering the true nature of Phantoms, I can\u2019t help but wonder why Ruru can\u2019t offer some input on this matter. I mean, she herself is a Phantom, one capable of speech even, so shouldn\u2019t she be able to elucidate on a few of these questions?\\n\\n\r\nThese generic cast members are all super-power wielders and they hence join a Phantom hunting club. The general plot (if you can call it that) is your standard, episodic monster-of-the-week formula with a sudden overarching plot crammed into the end. The monster-of-the-week episodes are consistently disappointing and poorly handled. The episodes usually begin with some idle comedic banter between the main cast in their clubroom, before they start noticing some odd-going-ons happening here and there; anything from students turning into cats to the main character turning to a child. As the audience, we immediately know that a Phantom must be responsible for whatever the calamity is (what else could it be?), but it certainly takes a long time for the cast of supposed experienced Phantom hunter to make the logical connection. It can be quite frustrating watching the cast bumble around for so long before they reach the obvious conclusion. After dicking about generously, the cast finally tracks down the Phantom responsible and we generally treated to highly lacklustre fights. The fights might seem somewhat impressive at first glance given the amount of quick movement, flashy attacks and motion blur used, but looking closely I found them to be gravely lacking in fight choreography and their general composition and framing. In the end they are just very colourful clusterfucks, and I feel like the animation wizards at KyoAni could have done much better on this front. These confrontations also usually come way too suddenly for us to get emotionally invested in the fight at all, and occasionally the Phantom designs are so silly-looking that it makes the battle harder to take seriously. Given that these battles often serve as the pay-off to usually boring and obvious mysteries, I feel like they should been done a lot better. One another thing I noticed is that the show seems uncertain whether or not it wants to audience to sympathize with the Phantoms. Occasionally, the mischief-making Phantoms are forgiven by the main characters and other times they are treated to an ass-kicking. It\u2019s all very inconsistent so it\u2019s hard for us to get a consistent message out of this show.\\n\\n\r\nPerhaps reflecting Haruhiko\u2019s pseudo-intellectual air, a few episodes in this series attempt to explore some genuine scientific concepts, such as Schrodinger\u2019s Cat and collective consciousness. Unfortunately, these are always completely butchered by the show and they provide no food-for-thought of any kind; acting almost like Haruhiko\u2019s irreverent fact-dropping. These scientific concepts are there simply for the sake of being there, and I doubt it really gets anyone\u2019s brain juices flowing. These weak scientific connections annoyed me more than they should have.\\n\\n\r\nThere are only a few episodes that actually felt almost worthwhile, the only problem being is that the events of those episodes are basically forgotten as the series continues. I will be summarizing the events of some episodes so beware of spoilers. [spoilers begin] One example of an episode that was almost worthwhile was the episode where Kurumi (the show\u2019s token loli) gets sucked into a surreal world of her own imagining. Whereas I had some issues with the episode\u2019s aesthetics, it felt worthwhile (for a short time at least) because it felt like Kurumi\u2019s character had developed somewhat. She learns to fend for herself and she seemingly gives up her childish emotional attachment to her teddy bear, Albrecht. This episode felt satisfying because it felt as if a previously useless character had matured significantly. The only problem is that this DOESN\u2019T LAST AT ALL, which in the grand scheme of things makes this episode absolutely POINTLESS. In the next few episodes, Kurumi goes back to being dead weight AND she still retains the childish habits that she seemingly shed in the previous episode! Why in the hell would you write an episode that develops a character only to reverse it immediately afterwards? Another similar, less frustrating, episode is the one where Reina gets sucked into an idyllic, pastel-coloured world where she has everything that she lacks in the real world. As mentioned before, she has troublesome family life, and naturally this idyllic world is attractive to her. This episode has a good message about avoiding escapism and facing your real world problems. However, we never get to see how Reina ends up fixing her family issues; instead, we just hear a quip from her in the final episode about how her family life is now suddenly going well. This subplot was the most (actually, the only) interesting thing about Reina\u2019s character and I would have loved to see some more development. But in the end, we don\u2019t get to see how it\u2019s resolved and exactly what her family issues actually were in the first place, which is a real let-down in the end. [spoilers end]\\n\\n\r\nWe do get a two-episode long story arc right towards the end of the series, which ends up being quite a bit better than the previous episode. It\u2019s still nothing great, but at least it develops some characters further and reveals some backstory. At this point the show\u2019s quality bumps up to at least a 5/10 but this arc isn\u2019t enough to change my general feelings about the show. It's still full of stupidities and an has an uneven tone throughout.\\n\\n\r\nKyoAni clearly knows that the source material they are working with is no good, so they attempt to breathe some life into it with their usual visual and aesthetic magic. I\u2019d say it\u2019s above average for the most part. The animation quality is consistent all the way throughout, and I find the character designs very pleasing (minus some of the Phantom designs). KyoAni experiments with a myriad of different colour schemes (sorry) and the end result is quite eye-popping. It certainly gives off the feeling that something significant has been changed about this world. Some episodes give off very different vibes than the others, with KyoAni even hiring out-of-house talent to give more variety to the visuals; a very rare move for this studio. Some episodes like the pastel-world are especially impressive, and thus I would have liked to have seen some more experimentation with the whole art style rather than just the colour scheme. The general shot composition is pretty great with each episode providing several standout shots, but typical of a KyoAni show directed by Tatsuya Ishihara, the sense of pacing with regards to the cuts is definitely problematic. Many times, the editing is far too rapid for us to truly soak in the details of each shot, which defeats the purpose of putting so much thought and detail into some of these shots. Another issue I had with the aesthetic of the show is the constant use of pixelation as a visual motif. This is heavily present in the OP and many of the Phantoms flicker like a dodgy computer screen when they take damage. Hard as I try, I fail to see the connection between the pixels and the Phantoms. It would have made sense if the show took place in cyberspace and they were fighting the virtualized manifestations of computer viruses or something, but the pixel motif really doesn\u2019t work here at all. It comes across as a superfluous detail with little thought put into it, which makes the aesthetic of the show feel somewhat haphazard.\\n\\n\r\nIf I haven\u2019t made it clear already, this show has quite a lot of fan-service. I won\u2019t harp on about this too much like some fanatical Evangelist, as there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the existence of fan-service, but it is very, very, very, disappointing to see a studio such as KyoAni using much a method to make us like the characters more. KyoAni has proven time and time again that they are capable of creating very engaging female characters without the need for jiggling breasts or panty-shots. I have seen some people try to justify the fan-service as \u201cwe are seeing the world from Haruhiko\u2019s eyes, so wherever he looks is where the camera looks!\u201d, which is seriously one of the stupidest excuses I have ever heard. KyoAni was lazy this time around and opted for the cheapest method of keeping the viewers engaged. KyoAni\u2019s usual flair for bringing their characters to life with little details is honestly drowned out by the booty screaming in your face. I want some character in my moeblobs, goddamnit. \\n\\n\r\nSo there you have it. An aimless, poorly-written mess built on clich\u00e9s and repetitive formulas, providing no incentive to keep watching or even care about the resolution of whatever episode you happen to be watching. You may still enjoy it simply for the visuals and simplistic comedy, but even then, I doubt even the most die-hard KyoAni fans probably won\u2019t have it high on their list. This show is an enormous waste of talent and I sincerely hope that KyoAni never makes anything like this ever again.\\n",

            "content": "Kyoto Animation or KyoAni has been defined in the last decade for basically only producing moe-related shows.  Haruhi, Hibike Euphonium, K-on, Beyond the Boundary, Hyouka Lucky Star, all of these shows have aspects to them that define what it is to be moe, including a cute girl artstyle, and most importantly, cute girls that make up most of the cast.  And so, for Winter 2016, KyoAni produced a fantasy anime by the name of Musaigen no Phantom World, or Phantom World for short (at least for me) filled with girls, nice art, and phantoms.\r\nStory:  After a viral outbreak several years back, manymembers of the world's population has had their brain chemistry changed in such a way where they can identify and interact with members of the spectral plane, better known as phantoms.  It is here where we follow the story of Haruhiko and his group of Phantom hunters spend their daily lives around these new spectral creatures with special powers that they can use to interact with phantoms to aid their community from noisy phantom threats.  IN HIGH SCHOOL!  (Because nothing is complete without the high school setting.)\\n\\n\r\nPhantom World is more or less focused on each member of the main characters.  Haruhiko and his fellow friends (which are all girls, might I add) are the main focus of this series, as practically every episode has some form of character focus where we look into one person's character since Phantoms \"are influenced by people\".  Either that, or we're dealing with some random Phantom case, where we devote the whole show to solving a Phantom problem, which more than likely, we focus on both of them in the same episode.  As a story, Phantom World isn't really interesting.  It's a standard setup of an episodic plot featuring character development that really isn't all that deep considering each case more or less takes up a whole episode, and the episode after that talk and/or shows other things.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that the show really drives in on are the Phantoms.  The show has a very hard time on explaining the major focus on the series, mostly due to the fact that the Phantoms are those \"We don't know as of yet what they are\" sort of deals.  As such, the explanation isn't really all too crazy and is largely incomplete due to that, especially since every Phantom it seems works differently than the last, making it so that many of the facts that you learn aren't easily relatable towards another Phantom.  They also have this other part of the anime involving the company that started the viral outbreak, and that by itself is also largely left to rot just like the incomplete explanation for Phantoms.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the story of Phantom World really isn't all that great.  It has a nice idea and does have some character development to go along with its episodic storyline, but there really isn't anything noteworthy about the series since it doesn't really go deeper into anything else that's going on.  Especially since the series intentionally leaves details out, meaning that there really isn't much to say aside from pointing out that that is what we get as a story.  (On the plus side, every episode pretty much gives you a free lecture on psychology and certain psychological experiments, so that's pretty neat, I guess.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Interesting base story and concept\\n\r\n+  Character development\\n\r\n-   Story is largely missing and/or intentionally missing details\\n\r\n-   Episodic storyline (Phantom of the Week) sort of thing\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  The characters in Phantom World is split up into roughly two sets.  The main characters, and the plot based side cast.\\n\\n\r\nHaruhiko is our main male protagonist and essentially our only male character that's even remotely worth talk about.  Haruhiko is a guy who likes to read and possesses a lot of what would be referred to as 'useless knowledge', as every bit of information that comes out of him usually doesn't pertain to the situation and/or the other characters don't really care much for it.  Haruhiko is quite a bland character.  There really isn't much to say about him because his character is more or less shoved to the end of the series, and focuses more on his backstory to become the character he is more so than really resolving any sort of problems that he has.  All in all, Haruhiko is a character that, like the rest of the show, has and shows potential, but doesn't really follow through on it.\\n\\n\r\nThen there're the rest of the main cast, featuring Mai, the senpai that we see from the start of the series, Reina, the bottomless pit of an Oujo-sama, Kurumi, the token Loli, Koito, that one cold girl who turns out to be relatively cute, and Ruru whose name is so long and confusing that I will give a medal to anyone who can pronounce the whole things.  More or less, these girls are the brunt of the series alongside the general phantom occurrences, as each of them get at least one episode dedicated to their character and the events of their life and/or personal struggles.  They're nice, but they're not too deep or deep enough to really create much of a rippling effect, so as a result, the character development is rather limited.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are just plot devices.  There's some explanation to go along with the majority of them, but for the most part, there's just nothing really all that interesting about them.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Character development\\n\r\n-   Largely uninteresting cast\\n\r\n-   Side cast is relatively unimportant\\n\\n\r\nArt:  Made by KyoAni, Phantom World boasts a very pretty looking artstyle that just gleams with color and brightness.  Everything has this nice gloss to it and the animation is rather fluid, as expected of KyoAni.  The characters and the general artstyle definitely come off as moe, as the girls are drawn with these relatively big eyes and cute looking exteriors that make it so that they're your more traditional moe character, even though they really aren't.\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't much fanservice to talk about since, beyond the first episode, we barely get if any fanservice that persists throughout the whole show, which is nice.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Great quality art\\n\r\n+  Some fanservice, but not too much\\n\r\n+/- Moe Artstyle (Some people hate this but hey, if you're watching a KyoAni show, this is what you get)\\n\\n\r\nSound:  The OP for Phantom World is a very techno and sort of disco-like OP that is quite honestly, addicting to listen to.  It has this energetic and unique beat that sets it apart from your normal cutesy anime opening.  The whole song is done electronically and was actually quite a nice surprise.\\n\\n\r\nThe ED on the other hand is...basically a cutesy anime song.  It has the girls bounce along to its happy go lucky beat and it's just...not really worth mentioning.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Unique and memorable opening\\n\r\n-   Ending song is...average\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  Phantom World was a series that I was quite honestly scared about.  Its setup reminded me of other fantasy related anime and that really stuck a thorn at my side cause I didn't want to go through another \"World Break\" incident.  (Freaking \"I remember\" bullshit pisses me off so much I broke a pen.)  But, you know, while I don't hold any innate malice for this show...I'm a bit disappointed.  From what I've heard, Phantom World's story apparently gets much darker and much more serious to the point that I WANT a second season.  Cause this shit...this shit ends too happy.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nI don't particularly like this anime per say, more so as I just sort of watched it for the sake of watching it.  Personally, I found Reina to be an absolutely adorable character, but that's just me.  Apart from that, nothing really stuck out as a quality that I personally loved.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nAgain, nothing in particular comes to mind.  Sure I could rant about how they didn't tell the whole story of everything, but that's mostly due to the way the LNs are written.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, unless this show is confirmed for a second season, I wouldn't recommend watching this.  It's a bit weird to be saying that but, given what I know about the story or Phantom World, watching this would more or less be pointless fluff if it didn't get any sort of sequel to it.  But of course, if you want to see something pretty that's KyoAni without much meaning to it, then go right on ahead.",

            "content": "--(Republished thanks to MAL)--\r\nPeople make mistakes, and so do animation studios. Sometimes, they deliver great works that stand the test of time; notable classics that give animation a great name. Other times, they fall drastically short on expectations. And this is fine. When you fail, you get back up, right? But sometimes, they create something so vapid, so disgustingly stupid, so unbelievably bad that if I wanted to take it seriously and laud it as a work of art to the masses, I\u2019d have to get a lobotomy first. And I promise you, the score for this series would only go up by a point.\r\nWhathappened, KyoAni? Tell me, with all honesty, what on earth happened to you? After artistic successes like Hyouka, Tamako Love Story, Nichijou and fucking Clannad After Story, to create something so deplorable tarnishes that very name. Yet, despite that, the fact that KyoAni is attached to the title still manages to attract a hefty amount of viewers; 100,000+ members on MAL as of today, which is about a third of the size of ERASED\u2019s viewership. And I don\u2019t blame them. We all have very fond memories of KyoAni series and to hope that they\u2019ll go back to their old ways isn\u2019t completely a dumb idea. However, after watching this series, it seems some of my own hope was shattered.\\n\\n\r\nTo begin, let\u2019s start with the setup, which is nearly every fantasy story ever written; a world of (insert supernatural phenomena here) and teenagers with special abilities correlating to (insert other supernatural phenomena here). Now, I have nothing against formulaic premises and sometimes, they\u2019re the base of many great stories out there. A chosen one destined to destroy evil? Harry Potter. A band of friends set on a quest to vanquish evil? The Lord of the Rings. A group of teenagers trapped in a fantasy world? The Chronicles of Narnia. But when the premise is used to create excuses to create the most elaborately planned fanservice I have ever watched, we have a very big problem. Instead of trying to make a good story out of a pretty generic setting, it\u2019s used to create situations in which the characters will be involved in fanservice of some kind. A phantom trapped in a cat mansion? Let\u2019s turn them into cat girls! The phantoms want to play limbo? Let\u2019s make the girl with the largest breasts bounce up and down for your viewing pleasure! And on and on it goes, one explicit fanservice attempt after the other. Literally nothing else is done with the premise. Phantoms exist and teenagers fight them, and that\u2019s all you\u2019re going to get. Oh yeah, and anime tiddies. It\u2019s so pathetic, to the point that I want to just cut my dick off, if only to keep away from the show\u2019s target audience. \u201cB-B-But, Magical! You\u2019re forgetting the hacking device! And Alayashiki!\u201d Oh, right, I\u2019m sorry. Are you talking about those two things that were only given significance in the LAST TWO EPISODES!? And no, I\u2019m not lying. The world building literally began right as the last two weeks came up. It\u2019s amazing how much effort series put into trying to save their own dead, lifeless narratives.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of Phantom World is just as deplorable. It\u2019s the same harem schlock, one dude-many girls romance, stereotypical piece of shit that does not go beyond being the same harem schlock, one dude-many girls romance, stereotypical piece of shit. They\u2019re unentertaining, drab and mostly there for the sake of self-insert, fanservice, pursue gags that don\u2019t work and being the most annoying little piece of shit since the advent of Na\u2019vi from The Legend of Zelda. Yes, I am talking about Ruru. While KyoAni has had their fair share of mascot characters, ranging from the adorable, loving Nagisa to the hard-hitting Moffle, all with their own charm, Ruru is nothing of the sort. There were times when I wanted to drop the series simply because she existed. I swear, I felt my head swelling every second she was on screen.\\n\r\nAnd speaking of making my head swell every second she was on screen, I would also like to roast\u2014I mean, address the world famous crab face, Kurumi. Her development episode was one of the stupidest 20 minutes of animation I have ever seen in my entire life. In said episode, the character underwent a Vietnamese PTSD because she lost her bear followed by an LSD trip comparable to a boxing match with Hitler where teddy bears talk and get boners from 10 year old girls. Oh yeah, and a mecha. And for what was the ultimate purpose of all of this? TO GET LOLI KURUMI IN A MAGICAL GIRL OUTFIT! Why? Because fucking FANSERVICE\u2014I mean, PHANTOMS, that\u2019s why!\\n\\n\r\nNow, despite what I said above, why do people still eat this series up and give it 7s and 8s. It\u2019s because of Kyoto Animation. When it comes to animating, KyoAni is a god. Smooth, crisps movements with great detail and outstanding artwork. But was it enough to cover up everything wrong with Phantom World? No, because while the animation was great, I couldn\u2019t help but doze off at the aesthetic design of the world, lame use of colors and generic character designs, despite the grandeur of the scene before me. The OP and ED were flashy but generic and forgettable. The soundtrack had all these little beats but nothing stood out at all, making the experience more dull than it already was. So, if we\u2019re talking about animating, it was great. But in terms of presentation, it\u2019s not up to par with any of their past works, good or bad.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t want to be one of those cynics that preach \u201cKyoAni is dead! KyoAni is dead!\u201d but this series just begs for it; a series that makes the likes of Kyoukai no Kanata a masterpiece by comparison. It will take a lot of work for them to redeem themselves from this garbage. But until that day comes, I guess we have more of this crap to look forward to for the next few years. As of this day, my expectations of Kyoto Animation have decreased tenfold.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, nothing is impossible. Maybe someday, this Endless Eight will get its Disappearance. And when that day comes, I\u2019ll be ready to let loose my wallet and shower whatever college money I have left over their studio singing \u2018Hail, KyoAni!\u2019\\n\r\nSomeday.\\n",

            "content": "Musaigen No Phantom World is an interesting anime created by the famous or infamous Kyoto Animation studio. Fans of Kyoani will know that their works are graphically consistent and fluid when it comes to animation. It's no different for Phantom World. Mundane tasks such as ripping off a bandaid are animated. The characters all feel very alive in their hands, there's no doubt about that.\r\nAlso, by god is the action eye-candy! There isn't as much of it here as in Kyoukai No Kanata, but there's quite a lot.\r\nIf you came to this show from their more recent works like Hibike Euphonium and Hyouka you mighthave different expectations of this show.\\n\r\nThis show is first and foremost trying to be fun.\\n\r\nThe anime has some pretty light fanservice in it. It's not as bad as Haruhi, or the Full Metal Panic series though. In fact, in terms of fanservice, it feels like an older show they've made. Unlike, Euphonium and Hyouka with direct mass appeal, I wouldn't recommend watching this show with non-anime fans or prudish people. I'd consider the fanservice light, but I don't think people who've only seen Hyouka or Euphonium would.\\n\\n\r\nNow that, that's out of the way let's get to the meat of things.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nThe Characters:\\n\r\n=====================\\n\r\nThis might come off as surprising but Phantom World barely has any supporting characters. Almost all of the characters feel like main characters!\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this interesting is that these characters play off of each other so well, it takes a while to notice. They're great. Each character has their own quirks and no one fades into the background unnoticed. They all stand distinguished on their own, and each brings something important to the other's lives.\\n\\n\r\nFinding out why the characters act the way they do is something to look forward to as well. I was never bored of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story:\\n\r\n=====================\\n\r\nEach episode has a central theme that ties into the whole episode and resonates in real life. You might actually learn something new from the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe story however does drag it's characters along for the ride at times. If the plot needs to develop a certain way the characters might act outside of expectations. This doesn't happen often, however; and the character's personalities stay consistent throughout.\\n\\n\r\nIt is a fun show though. The color palette is one of the brightest, most saturated I've seen from them in recent memory. The comedy has gotten to me to. I've definitely laughed at the antics of the characters more than once. The world is interesting. It's mysterious and really makes me beg them to take itself more seriously just so I can understand it better, but I didn't want that to ruin the other aspects of the show I enjoyed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAll in All...\\n\\n\r\nMusaigen No Phantom World is one of the FIRST shows I watch every week on release. I always want to know what happens next, and I think that's because I care about the characters in the show, find their world interesting, and love it's overall tone. If you want an anime to relax with, I'd recommend it. If you don't mind light fanservice with light romance, I'd also recommend it.",

            "content": "(NOTE: THIS WAS REMOVED PREVIOUSLY DUE TO LACK OF EPISODES WATCHED, SO AN UPDATE TO THIS REVIEW IS REQUIRED IN ORDER FOR IT TO STAY UP.)\r\nKyoto Animation, as a studio, has pretty much sated our hunger for anime, and a lot of the stuff they make is usually great. But every now and again, they hit a rut: they make an anime that's so bad, bland, and/or boring, that they try and cover up that anime's mediocre fanservice, unmemorable soundtrack, bad characters, worse character development with a pseudo-interesting take on its genre, beautiful art, and flashy effects. Notice the keyword \"try.\" If you're smart andalert, you can catch KyoAni red-handed. We've seen it with Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!, we've seen it with Free! Iwatobi Swim Club; we've also seen it with spinoffs of rather successful/respectable KyoAni works, such as Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu, K-On!, and Hyouka.\\n\\n\r\nMusaigen no Phantom World is no different. Once starting off as a very good manga, its anime adaptation behaved as Pupa did, in the sense that it failed to meet the standards of its manga predecessor.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nMusaigen no Phantom World is basically just another show that Kyoto Animation slips up on, and tried to cover up with some fat anime tiddies and lolis. While the story that Musaigen concocted sounded great in theory - humans being able to see and interact with supernatual entities known as Phantoms due to a research facility bombing spreading a virus that gives humans this ability - the execution was rather lacking. There have been other anime out there where people can interact with otherworldly beings... but they do the job better... Like Mushishi. Hell, I think even InuYasha did it better: that show's cast at least had to JUMP through a bunch of flaming hoops to get to their goal.\\n\\n\r\nI think Musaigen's story started to tank when KyoAni defaulted to the boring high school setting, and not coming up with an original, or a not-so-overused setting. It was even exacerbation by giving a select few characters in the show super powers, in a sense. In hindsight... it wasn't exactly the best idea. It wasn't even a good idea. They're not just abilities, but they're... \"special\" abilities. Because having a teddy bear grow to ten times its size to fight for you, and rubbing your jugs to try and use the \"element of fire from your heart\" is definitely what I call \"special.\"\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI gotta give it to Kyoto Animation: they know to make even some of their worst works look really, REALLY good. I feel bad to constantly roast them like this, since Musaigen's art has been proven to be very well done. The effects are very nice, too, and everything in the show feels really vibrant. I haven't experienced good visual quality like it since Hyouka or Hibike! Euphonium.\\n\\n\r\nTheir art and visual effects might have been their saving grace if everything else was better. Unfortunately, that is not the case.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nMusaigen has fairly decent sound as well as their art. The sound effects of fight scenes between the characters and the Phantoms, the battle roars/cries of the Phantoms during these fights, the small little lilts of noise of each character's abilities; all of them are relatively decent. Sadly, Musaigen's SOUNDTRACK proves to be an issue: the OP and EP are both rather unmemorable and grating to the ears. The music during the fight scenes are heavily forgotten about as well, because of the visual effects that mesmerise us and distract us overall. Argh, damn you, beautiful graphics!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nHere we go, folks. We're at my least favourite part... or favourite. It is long, after all, so I guess it depends on whether or not you think I enjoy ranting about dreadful characters in Musaigen no Phantom World. Characters make up everything for the anime, from how we perceive them to how they develop from beginning to end. But Musaigen's characters are, for lack of a better term... trash.\\n\\n\r\nHaruhiko Ichijou is our main male protagonist, in a cast that is overrun with attractive females (and a loli.) That alone should already be ringing a loud angry alarm in your head to a nice, roaring 10 exawatts. He's basically the nerdy kid that gets ragged on by his peers for bearing too much \"useless\" information. While he has the ability to banish and summon Phantoms by quickly drawing them in his sketchbook, the first half of his special power is pretty much made null and void by Izumi Reina, who we will be getting to shortly. Thus, Haruhiko has become what we label a \"cuck\" after the first few episodes. He does undergo mild improvement, but nothing whatsoever that appears to get rid of that NTR  nature that shows he'll still get dumpster'd by his friends.\\n\\n\r\nHaruhiko's annoying Phantom companion, Ruru, is basically a huge-chested Navi that's just blitzed on the strongest strain of amphetamines. She's cute to look at, but will cause the aneurysm in your head to swell more and more by the minute. I honestly thought she would be more levelheaded by the end, but unfortunately, that ain't the case.\\n\\n\r\nKawakami Mai is the large-breasted female MC. Is that alarm from earlier getting louder in your head? Well, we're not even halfway done yet, so buckle up even further. She's an unoriginal character, quite frankly: large jugs, awesome feats of strength, seemingly perfect and adored by her peers: she's basically Medaka from Medaka Box, but blonde. Her ability lets her rub her body parts, namely her rack and her hips, to summon an element from their respective spots to fight Phantoms with... it's like a sensual version of Avatar: The Last Airbender. Booooring, next. \\n\\n\r\nIzumi Reina, another female MC, is basically the \"ojou-sama\" of the show, with her soft-spoken demeanor, proper manners, strict parents, and her urge of saying \"How dare you!\" every time Haruhiko gets too close to her goodies (because those are the apparent perks of being a male in a harem-like anime), resulting in her cucking - I mean, decking him. Her ability allows her to banish Phantoms by devouring them, and this not only cucks Haruhiko even more, but of course this has to interfere with her personal life: she has an unrealistic appetite, and can eat anyone under the table, but she never has enough money. She's not a boring character by any means, but that doesn't mean she's not generic in terms of her personality and traits.\\n\\n\r\nMinase Koito is yet another female MC in this ragtag harem of misfits. I can somewhat empathise with her: listening to music and being alone is what I do on a daily basis. However, she's basically just the generic \"lone wolf\" character who underwent ostracisation because she's more of a rebel/thug for her peers to handle. Her ability lets her use singing to combat Phantoms She's... okay, in the sense that she is cute, independent and can be kind of a badass at times, but her inability to warm up to others in reasonable time puts her behind greatly.\\n\\n\r\nKumamakura Kurumi is the shy lolita supporting character. I... I have to roast her. I can't NOT do it. First of all, this character is ten years old, and she still brings her teddy bear, Albrecht, to school. In one episode, she underwent PTSD harder than a war veteran at the peak of his 'Nam flashbacks because she *lost her bear* only to have the apparent psychedelic trip she's obviously on go into full swing when the teddy bear started talking to her in a magical land filled with giant mushrooms, because of, you guessed it, those darn Phantoms meddling in peoples' business! Second of all, her hair makes me pop a blood vessel in my eye harder than the filthy lolicons can pop a stiffy to hentai of her. She legitimately looks as though she woke up and called downstairs, \"Hey, mom! Can I look like a praying mantis today?\" It's even worse because her character was cute, to the point where I'm sickened by it all, and her development as a character is only slight, with her shy demeanor being a less crippling obstacle for her by a minute amount.\\n\\n\r\nAs you can tell, I have a deep-rooted loathing/disappointment for some of these characters. What is even more hilarious is that KyoAni tries to that thing, that really annoying thing where they make the harem aspect more harem-y by poking fun at the bonds between Haruhiko and the girls, like \"when are they gonna go out/get married?\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite me ragging on Musaigen for its awful cast, I guess it's...fun? I mean, I guess that's all it is, like Chuunibyou was. The humour that Musaigen brought to the table was more or less hit or miss with a lot of the audience. It wasn't gut-busting when you did get it, either: it was just a little chuckle, or slightly more air escaping your nostrils. It was more or less cute girls doing cute things with a guy being thrown into awkward and risque situations for comedic relief. As a grown man who has undergone tons of cute girls doing cute things with Yuru Yuri, School-Live!, Kiniro Mosaic, Love Lab, and more, to be turned off from watching something with that many incorporations of moe-trash in it defeats me, really. Still, it is what I classify as fun, using the word \"fun\" as loosely as possible.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10 ((5+8+6+2+4)/5 = 5)\\n\\n\r\nIt's average, at best. The sound is okay and the art is amazing. However, the music was rather lacklustre, the story could have been executed in a much better way, and the characters absolutely sucked. It's enjoyable only when you're making fun of it, honestly. KyoAni came up to bat, and while they did try to provide a very good show, it just became something that was namby-pamby, wishy-washy, and relatively bland like unflavoured tofu. All I can say is that at least they tried. But it wasn't their best, not by a long shot.",

            "content": "I've reiterated this in the past and let me say it again: KyoAni is like the Lamborghini of the anime realm. I say this so because whenever KyoAni releases an anime, the entire anime realm and fans know about it, in the same way as car enthusiasts immediately know what these Lambroghinis are: the Miura, Islero, Diablo, Murcielago, Gallardo, Aventador and Huracan. Yes, we know what these cars are\u2014named after famous bulls.\r\nRecently however, KyoAni seemed to have become \"Audi\", what's with the Amagi Brilliant Park? It falls short on the KyoAni material but it still passes the KyoAni-ness with flying colors, Hibike Euphonium does struggleand became underrated but it is better, but this time--it's worse.\\n\\n\r\nI watched 12 out of 13 episodes of this Musaigen no Phantom World. And since the FMP Fumoffu, to InuYasha movies, to Air and Kanon, I've watched and grew with KyoAni. Then comes Haruhi Suzumiya, Clannad, and Lucky Star; and the renowned awesomeness that defined the studio: K-On, Hyouka, Chuunibyou, KNK and Tamako Market even. Then what happened recently?\\n\\n\r\nWatching 12 out of 13 episodes... I have never dropped a KyoAni anime---until now.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY = 2\\n\r\nI'm gonna say it straightaway: Phantom World is REDUNDANT to Kyoukai no Kanata. No, it isn't similar as other anime fans would say. The difference with \"redundant\" to \"similar\" is that \"redundancy\" is just unnecessary, it's not needed; while similar is like...uh, the BMW is similar to Mercedes-Benz, that kinda. Both cars are alike in ways but both are still needed in this world. \\n\r\nSo why is KyoAni making this? If KyoAni wanted to stick with youkai stuffs, make a KNK season 2 instead. Or, they can throw the Musaigen script to other anime studios like JC Staff.\\n\\n\r\nThe pace of the story is un-KyoAni-ish to be honest. All it has is fanservice, fanservice, filler, fanservice + filler, initial story, fanservice again, boring ep, character+plot emphasized, last ep, then the end. Yes, in this pace. I could honestly label this as JC Staff material, for this is what JC Staff is good at. Or Collaboration Works (excuse me on this one).\\n\\n\\n\r\nART = 10\\n\r\nThis is KyoAni after all.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND = 7\\n\r\nSeiyuus here are Sumire Uesaka, Maaya Uchida, Misaki Kuno, Hiro Shimono, and yes, Saori Hayami. I love these seiyuus as much as they voiced other great anime characters since. There's just one problem: none of them can save Musaigen no Phantom World from the disappointment.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER = 5\\n\r\nCharacterization is fair, or a bit mediocre. If you've watched something like Date-A Live or Infinite Stratos, characters feel and are in that characterization-level, in which you can utterly say that they're likable enough. \\n\r\nThen again, another problem persists, and that is: none of these shows I've sampled are from KyoAni. If I were to grade this using the KyoAni-checklist, Musaigen is just mediocre at best, and this is me sugarcoating things already.\\n\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT = 1\\n\r\nFanboys and those who like borderline-ecchi fanservices will thoroughly enjoy this. They can fap to it even.\\n\r\nAs for me, long ago I had been loving KyoAni with their memorable shows and lovable characters. I have respected KyoAni for what the reputation it built themselves so far. Moeshit or not, KyoAni's selling point is that, and that's what makes them great. KyoAni is as metaphorically memorable as Lamborghini: it has the quality, the presence, the reputation, the recognition, the awesomeness of the lot.\\n\r\nNot with the Musaigen Phantom World though.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL = 4\\n\r\nPutting a 4 on this is generous enough.\\n\r\nAnd let me put it this way, in a Lamborghini-ish analogy: imagine Lamborghini with their V10 Huracans/Gallardos, and V12 Aventadors/Murcielagos/Diablos. Now imagine the brand embarking on making sedans, 4-cylinder engine sedans at that. You're surely gonna exclaim \"hold on! Why a sedan all of a sudden?!\" And then Lamborghini will tell you simply how good the car is and how luxurious it is and how engineering-gamechanging it is, but won't tell you how unreasonable they turned out to be. On its own it may just be a good car---a good sedan. But a Lamborghini sedan? Thinking of the Lamborghini marque in a taxi or company car---no, just no. This might be cool on a Hyundai or Audi venture--yes, but for Lamborghini---NO.\\n\\n\r\nMusaigen no Phantom World just gives this effect. \\n\r\nYes, animation is superior, \\n\r\nyes, action scenes are really fun to look at, \\n\r\nand yes, character design is pretty,\\n\r\nbut all these are the things you already expect from KyoAni. It all started in FMP Fumoffu, to K-On, to KNK, so we all know what caliber and potency to expect. \\n\r\nLooking at its inner drama, the characterization and their struggles, and the plot were just bland and it doesn't live up to the KyoAni marque, it fell short from the KyoAni caliber, it just doesn't feel like KyoAni, it lacked the KyoAni moe/moeshit elements, and it just doesn't have that KyoAni flair and passion.\\n\\n\r\nSo what's left? Just disappointment. This is why Musaigen no Phantom World is historically my first ever KyoAni anime I DROPPED from my list.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT: yes all is said and done and it's a good-enough anime, IF AND ONLY IF it was \"NOT\" made by KyoAni.",

            "content": "Musaigen No Phantom World (Also known as Myriad Colors Phantom World) is a show about people fighting phantoms (in the most basic explanation. If you want to know what it is all about then thats what the synopsis is for). The main character's name is Ichigo Haruhiko and he owns a harem, although the show denies any connection to the harem genre. \r\nThe first thing noticeable about this show is the graphics. Lately, most animes I watch have the same generic graphics. None of them have particularly good or bad graphics, just generic. This show is different. In the title of the show (Myriad ColorsPhantom World) it already suggests that the show has good graphics because of the word myriad. Google the word if you don't already know  the meaning. (Assuming you've Googled it) Good. Now that you know the definition you should know the show has a lot of color. The art is amazing (to summarize in less than one whole paragraph). This has become a lesson in English Language Arts, so i'm just gonna move on.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds in this show are great. The opening is one of the most notable things about this show. Naked Dive is an amazing opening. It fits perfectly with the show's opening scenes (the video that plays over the opening, like the theme song part. ugh, this is getting confusing. you know what I mean.) although I can't say the same about the ending. I don't enjoy the ending that much. I think i've only listened to it once or twice. Anyway, on to the next segment.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development of this show is great. Unlike in other animes, there is light shone on the character's past. They don't randomly appear out of nowhere and announce, \"hey guys, i'm a new character. Pay attention to me\"  unlike other anime's main characters. They get their own episodes where their personality and past is revealed. Even answers about their past is revealed in the final episodes. The only people without their own episodes are irrelevant characters (like Ichigo's friend, who appears in every fourth-or-so episode lol) which is quite obvious. Even Ruru (Ichigo's phantom that follows him every where [similar to Ash and Pikachu's relationship]) gets her own episode.\\n\\n\r\nFor the enjoyment of this show, I think you can tell by all the praise i've given it. This is a really great, enjoyable show. I recommend you watch it soon. If you have nothing to watch and you want to see something with amazing graphics than this is the show for you.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I only watched this Anime to see where Kyoto Animation were dumping their money. This anime is just average. You could be watching better shows but it isn't offensively bad.\r\nStory is like not even there, just \"Monster of The Week\" type of deal. Then  the last 2 episodes it realizes it needs to do something so it crams something in with the climax only being alluded to early on by a literal plot device.\r\nBut \"Monster of The Week\" isn't a bad formula as long as the characters are enjoyable to watch. The characters in the show just come off as watchable, they're not reallyspecial, they're not tiring to watch. They're just \"Eh\". Except for 1 character, Ruru who is god damn ANNOYING - She is like an alternative to acid for my eyes and ears. I didn't really care for any of them and they want us to care for them but it's all just poorly executed and developed. Whatever hi jinx they got up to was just watchable.\\n\\n\r\nArt is what kept me going on to finish the anime. It's eye candy, nice to see.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is just... I'm struggling to even remember a song from this series and I just finished this series 6 hours ago as of what I'm writing right now.\\n\\n\r\nI figured out what makes this anime really come off as weak and that is with its characters. They're so bland and \"eh.\" The shenanigans they get up to are nothing special but they're fun without doubt. I'd say in the funny skits/situations Myriad's characters get into and if you were to replace the them with another set of characters from another slice of life/comedy anime then it would be 100 times more enjoyable. Take for instance the limbo scene in episode 1, it was an fun skit but imagine if they were replaced by K-ON!'s characters or Clannad's characters or even Amagi Brilliant Park's characters. The chemistry between Myriad's characters is just lacking.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is just wasted potential, wasted money. But it is not offensively bad. It was a (word better than ok but worse than nice) anime to watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - It's basically Chuunibyou S2 except has NOTHING redeeming in it.",

            "content": "Musaigen no Phantom World is a pretty tricky one to examine. It does a lot of things wrong, that\u2019s for sure, but they also do things that make it watchable and actually enjoyable at times. It's very clich\u00e9, uninteresting and random to the point of annoying at times. However, its concept and world-building is nice and it is very creative. For most of the time, it goes nowhere and It\u2019s pretty lame, but near the end, it felt like the anime found its track again. However, that doesn\u2019t excuse the fact that more than half of this anime being nothing more than average, and thisseries overall is a disappointed. \\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nMusaigen no Phantom World takes place in a world where artificial creatures called phantom are found around in the world due to some virus spreading. People who have supernatural powers help in sealing these phantoms for the peace of the world. The story revolves around a group of high school students that work together to seal these phantoms. First of all, the premise is actually pretty interesting. It isn\u2019t anything unique, but it can work. Unfortunately, it failed to deliver. As an episodic anime, not much of its stories are interesting. The first two thirds of this anime felt very pointless and unnecessary. There were too many gimmicks and not enough substance, which is a shame considering its premise. The series adapted the first volume of the light novels. Normally, when an anime rushes its content compared to its original source, it is considered a flaw. However, with Musaigen no Phantom World, it would have benefited so much more if they skipped some of those lame stories they adapted and moved on to the second volume. The reason why I say this is because the second volume is where the real story starts and it starts taking a really twisted and dark tone. It feels like a completely different series and it\u2019s a shame we don\u2019t get to see that. At least the writing in the last third was pretty good. \\n\r\nStory: 4/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nMusaigen no Phantom World excels in world-building. The world they present, one with phantoms lurking around in the world is really cool and pretty well done. The atmosphere did feel nice. However, everything else about the presentation is lacking. The first and major problem is its structure and its use. Musaigen no Phantom World has an episodic structure. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that as there has been may episodic anime that have excelled very well. The problem is that unlike those other episodic anime, where those tiny stories weaved together to make one larger story, Musaigen no Phantom World feels like a mess. Most of these stories aren\u2019t even remotely interesting and in the end, most of them felt pretty pointless, which is a shame since the anime ended right before it was about to get to the good stuff. If Musaigen no Phantom World did its dark twist in this series, the anime could have been compared to the likes of Madoka Magica in terms of tone, and Steins;Gate in terms of content. But with them sticking to just the first volume Musaigen no Phantom World looks nothing more than your average, clich\u00e9 fantasy school anime with unnecessarily fanservice. \\n\r\nPresentation: 3/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nA part of me really like these characters, but a part of me also hates them too. The characters in Musaigen no Phantom World couldn\u2019t be more cardboard cutouts than they already. The main character, Haruhiko, is nothing but a generic high school teenager who falls behind in his skills, meanwhile his much superior team members outshine him in every way. It is interesting hearing his remarks in the beginning of each episode, but they are pretty pointless. At least we know he\u2019s smart. Then you have Mai, who\u2019s body gets more focus that her face. She\u2019s basically the clich\u00e9 outgoing character who\u2019s just there to add to the fanservice. Then you have Reina, who is that clich\u00e9, quiet, but nice female who\u2019s just there to be waifu material. Then you have Koito, that clich\u00e9 kuudere because some people get turned on by coldheartedness. Also, there\u2019s a loli too because we can\u2019t forget a loli! Oh yeah, there\u2019s this phantom girl that looks like a fairy that\u2019s annoying as hell. Even though I\u2019ve been negative about these characters for a while, let me get to the good part. Most of these characters get their own centric episode to develop them as characters. The one that stood out the most was Haruhiko\u2019s as it actually leaves an impact and can relate to real world problems. In that same episode, Mai gets some good development too (though the same can\u2019t be said about her own centric episode). Ruru\u2019s was also pretty good too. Reina\u2019s and Kurumi\u2019s were pretty lacking though, mainly because their episodes were way too over-the-top, unfocused and too gimmicky.\\n\r\nCharacter: 4/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nMusaigen no Phantom World\u2019s art is fantastic, which is to be expected since KyoAni has a good track record with their production values. The art is really pretty and really well detailed. The colors are really vibrant and eye catching. The backgrounds are very well detailed too. The character designs aren\u2019t anything too special as they are stuff you\u2019ve seen before, but it\u2019s still very neat. Everything looks good and there\u2019s no hiccups in the art. Its art style is also pretty nice too. The color palette only uses vibrant colors and they really add an effect. The phantom designs have this cartoonish look and it\u2019s a nice addition. But even with its cartoony feel, it still doesn\u2019t lack detail. Musaigen no Phantom World proves to be stellar technically.\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nThe animations in Musaigen no Phantom World is top-notch which again was expected because KyoAni always delivers in these categories. The animations are very fluid and very crisp. The character motions are top notch too. During the action scenes, the fluidity is fantastic and the camera view always works. The amount of work put into the animation is very noticeable. Small little details such as the animations of clothes if pressure is given (for example, when Mai is rubbing herself (because god knows why that\u2019s relevant)). However, the most useless things also get too much effort put into. All those breast physics are very distracting and ruin the more realistic feel to the animation, especially since they got a lot of realism going in the animations (such as the clothes physics). Nevertheless, this is where Musaigen no Phantom World shines. \\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe voice acting in Musaigen no Phantom World is decent, but with such a good cast, more could have been done. Shimono Hiro isn\u2019t anything special as Haruhiko, mainly because his script doesn\u2019t ask for much. Unfortunately, he doesn\u2019t add anything more, he just does what he needs to do. Still, his talent makes him look good. Uesaka Sumire is pretty good as Mai as she the does the senpai character properly. Again, nothing too special, but it gets the job done. Hayami Saori\u2019s a fantastic seiyuu and she has a wide range, but she doesn\u2019t do anything too special with Reina, and at times, he voice for Reina ends up feeling irritating as it feels so clich\u00e9. I don\u2019t know what to say about Uchida Maaya, because her character, Koito, barely talk. But from what I\u2019ve heard, she did good. Also Kurumi and Ruru\u2019s seiyuu do a fine job too. In the end, the voice acting works, but none of the seiyuu do more than asked. \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe music in Musaigen no Phantom World is pretty good. The OP, \u201cNaked Dive\u201d, is really catchy and fun. Although it\u2019s the first 20 seconds that I really love (it\u2019s too catchy). The rest of the OP is okay, but the vocals aren\u2019t too fascinating. The ED, \u201cJunshin Always\u201d, is alright. It\u2019s not too catchy or memorable, but the vocals are pretty good in that ED. The background music used in Musaigen no Phantom World is great though. There are wide variety in the music. The best ones are those techno beat-ish music they use during the action scenes. They work so well and they make the scenes more fun. The background music is one of the better things about this anime.\\n\r\nMusic: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to say whether or not I enjoyed Musaigen no Phantom World. Roughly 1/3rd of the anime is actually good in terms of plot (no not \u201cplot\u201d, but actual plot), which is pretty much the last couple of episodes. The rest 2/3rd of the anime is content that is more miss than hit. However, the world-building and the animations make this anime much more enjoyable. But the characters were too clich\u00e9 to be likeable. Stupid characters doing stupid things isn\u2019t very enjoyable at all. And the fact that this ticks every box in the list of anime clich\u00e9s makes this even less enjoyable. If the second volume was adapted however, oh boy would things be different!\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Musaigen no Phantom World isn\u2019t really something worth your time. It tries to make you enjoy it by using its gimmicks and fantastic animations, but when you only have style, but not enough substance, it\u2019s definitely visible. The characters are just a bunch of overused clich\u00e9s. At least a couple of the characters got proper development. Most of the episodic stories are uninteresting, but it seems like the anime found its way at the end. But unfortunately it spent too much time on volume 1 of the light novel that we couldn\u2019t get to see the much superior volume 2. Overall, Musaigen no Phantom World is only recommended for those KyoAni fans that love their production values, or those who don\u2019t mind a gimmick-filled anime. \\n\\n\r\n+ Interesting premise with very good world-building \\n\r\n+ Great art with vibrant colors complimented by fantastically fluid animations \\n\r\n+ Last third of the anime is much more focused and enjoyable\\n\r\n- Most of the anime is unorganized and doesn\u2019t go anywhere \\n\r\n- Characters are very clich\u00e9-driven and unoriginal and some lack development\\n\r\n- Didn\u2019t cover the second volume and the major plot twist, making the series look even more pointless\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4.8/10",

            "content": "I''ve never written a review before, but for some reason I felt inclined to write one for this one, so bear with me. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nMusaigen had a lot of potential. Potential that only really showed in 4 episodes (three of which were the last ones). It didn't really have an overarching storyline, aside from some development and findings needed for the last 2 episodes. Instead, it was for the most part and episodic show, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It could work. The problem was, there was no way I could take those episodes seriously, with exception of those 4 episodes I mentioned. Ifelt like they wanted me, the viewer, to, but failed to do so. If the show was as good as it was in the last 3 episodes, it would've been much much better.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animatio: 9/10\\n\r\nOf course, since this was a KyoAni production, the expections for it to be at least good looking were definitely high, and those expectations were definitely met. The art and animation was gorgeous even in moments it they didn't need to be. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nI don't really have anything to say about the soundtrack. It didn't realy stand out to me, but it didn't bother me either, so I suppose that was good. Though one thing that did bother me was the opening song. Not because it was necessarily bad, but because of the intro. The speeding up wasn't gradual and that really bothered me for some reason.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters might've been a bit cliched and didn't have all that much development (with exceptions here and there), but I happened to like them and started caring for most of them anyway. Shoot me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nDespite the mediocre story, I enjoyed this show very much, which, for me, is all I care about really. If I enjoy an anime despite all its flaws, it's a good show in my book. It was a show that I could just sit back and relax to while basking in the glorious art and animation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give the show a 7,5/10 (not an 8, but you know, MAL doesn't allow decimals), which I suppose is quite high, but considering enjoyment is what I find most important, that was to be expected. I do feel like people are giving it more shit than it deserves. Maybe people might've had incredibly high expectations of the show because it was made by KyoAni? Which I don't think is really fair. Yeah, KyoAni has so many amazing shows that this anime can't even wish to touch in its current state, but it's not that bad (I think).\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime? It depends on what person I'm talking to and what kind of anime they want. If they want a well thought-out anime with very intricate plot details then... no, I wouldn't. If they want a show they could watch just to relax to, then yes, absolutely. It's an easy watch, especially with the amazing animation.\\n",

            "content": "Musaigen no Phantom World is a very good show that really does not get the respect it deserves. Yes, it is cliche, and yes, KyoAni has sold their soul to the devil, but we need to stop looking at this show for its cliches and producers, and look at it for what it is, a charming, funny, engaging and an overall very solid anime. \r\nStory: 6\r\nThere isnt much of a story, but the way the show is set up, it doesn't need a story. Each episode is its own arc, making each episode feel very fresh and new. The episodes never get stale, and arevery varied. No two episodes feel the same. The concept of the show is unique and pretty damn cool. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe show is very aesthetically pleasing. The art style is vibrant and colorful. Not much else to say.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nSound is also very good. Not much else to say here too. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime seem pretty generic when first viewed, but there is actually quite a bit of depth in each character. Mai seems pretty cookie cutter tsundere until you get to episode 10 or 11, where a whole new, mother-like aspect of her character comes into play. Reina is also sort of cookie-cutter, however when you consider her upbringing and background, you discover her personality fits her pretty well. Same with Koito. All of the characters seem kind of bland, but as you watch further, you really get to know them better. Plus, Kurumi and Ruru are both great. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. Sure, some see it as generic, but I personally respect all of it's aspects, and really consider it to be a fresh approach on a good-but-somewhat-bland concept. It is just an easy show to pick up and watch. There isn't a complicated story arc or incredibly deep characters, but it doesnt need that, its not that kind of anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nLook, I know KyoAni is sort of a train wreck. And I know it is kind of generic. But that shouldn't matter. Some of the reviews on here are really just awful. The top review on here is by someone that is clearly so watered down that they cant respect a show for what it is. People need to stop complaining about how KyoAni sucks or how its cliche, and start looking at it for what it is; a very solid anime in every aspect that is lighthearted, doesn't take itself too seriously, and is overall just a fun and easy watch. I recommend that any anime fan should give it a shot.",

            "content": "Musaigen no Phantom World is different than your typical anime. Each episode is a standalone, with no overarching or subplots. \r\nMusaigen no Phantom takes place after a virus alters the human brain allow mankind to see spirits and phantoms. The characters go around sealing phantoms that cause trouble. The anime attempts to justify the current world through science and personally i found it to be a fair blend of both. \r\nStory:   \r\nwhat story \r\nCharacter:\r\ncharacters are mainly static, as they dont develop a lot. However this doesnt not mean they are bad characters.  Static characters work well with the standalone method. Episodes sometimesfocus on a particular character allowing for developments they need. for example in one episode Kumamakura, Kurumi develops to become braver and casts aside her anxiety.\\n\\n\r\nAlso im glad MC is not all powerful.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n nothing caught my attention. I had no urge to sit through the opening or ending.   and nothing that was really bad. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\r\ni found the art to be very colorful and eyecatching. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nto my surprise i had a really good time with this anime. i enjoyed the science such as Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, and how we perceive and store memory. \\n\\n\r\nHarem: \\n\r\nthere is none, at first it may look like a harem as he is surrounded by females but none of the females try to make a move on him and the MC isnt really attracted of any of the females. its quite refreshing to see a MC surrounded by girls with no romantic element. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nthis anime isnt for all people however, im glad that i went and watched this anime without being affected by peoples opinions and reviews. This series has its problems but it has its good side. \\n",

Overall, I enjoyed this anime as a whole, and everything I don't complain about I was quite happy with.\r\nAs for complaints: \r\n1) I like the idea of a worldwide event that leads to the existence of the paranormal (kinda like Area D). However, I'm not a fan that they are the global subconscious made corporeal. I probably would haveintroduced some plot fixing fairy dust into the mix or just elaborated on what that event was if I had to keep that point.\\n\\n\r\n2) Introduction of characters is a little slipshod and unorganized. The development of relationships between even more so.\\n\\n\r\n3) The magic system is... hectic, but luckily only focuses on a select group of characters.\\n\\n\r\n4) One or two characters are almost entirely two dimensional (in the story-writing sense), but still lovable.\\n\\n\r\nDefinite compliments:\\n\\n\r\n1) I love the animation style and I will likely lose anime fan credibility for it. I'm kind of a sucker for jump cuts (in anime, not cinema), and any shot that makes you question whether or not the story, the narrator, or even your own thoughts on the situation are trustworthy.\\n\\n\r\n2) Despite being hectic, the magic system is certainly varied, as are the powers of the antagonist, and the methods of dealing with said antagonists. Original ideas were definitely indulged.\\n\\n\r\n3) Character arcs are very different and occur at different times. It gives you the time to get to know each character, how they can assist the other characters, but you don't need that first character maturation to understand.\\n\\n\r\nFinal comments:\\n\\n\r\nGood anime, but not one I can sit down and watch multiple episodes in one setting. That's about the best I can do without spoilers.",

            "content": "In 2009 a game called Resident Evil 5 was released by Capcom. RE5 was, for the most part, a great game but was ultimately panned by a large portion of the fan base. The game would go on to receive criticism not due to the fact that it was a poor game but because it wasn't as good as its predecessor \"Resident Evil 4\" and could never live up to the hype and momentum of its \"big brother\".\r\nMyriad Colors Phantom World is experiencing a similar \"big brother\" effect. Having been produced by Kyoto Animation, the excellent animation studio responsible for very well respected series suchas Clannad, K-On, Kyoukai no Kanata and Free, Phantom World comes out of the gate with an unrealistically high bar to meet. \\n\\n\r\nThe truth of the matter is that Phantom World is a fine anime series. The characters aren't anything you haven't seen before but are all lovable and I can confidently say I will remember most of them several months down the road. The plot and story come off as a little dry and recycled from years of \"industry standard meta\" material but the uniqueness of the main characters power helps add a little bit of fresh air into the dank plot. \\n\\n\r\nThe story chugs along at an even pace that may range from \"watchable\" to \"enjoyable\" with the last two episodes being the clear highlights of the entire 13 episode span with a villain that is as refreshing as she is \"ara ara\".\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is outstanding, to put it bluntly, meeting the already \"above and beyond\" standards set by Kyoto. The sound track is another, often over-looked gem. The near constant stream of excellent music helps bring the scenes to life and is nothing but a compliment to the animators at Kyoto.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Myriad Colors Phantom World may not be remembered as the defining anime released under the Kyoto name but it is certainly a fine accomplishment. And that is okay. It is alright for us to enjoy something, even if it isn't \"as good\" as we would have liked.",

It really felt like it was some sort of elaborate trick.\r\nThe story starts off somewhat interesting. We find ourselves in a modern Japan inhabited by fantasy like creatures called phantoms. A virus escaped a research facility and caused a shift in human brain function which allowed everyone to be aware of these phantoms. Some of these people develop special abilities and some of those people use their abilities to fight the bad phantoms. This show follows a group of high schoolers ina club designed around fighting phantoms.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode is a great hook into the show. They showcase a few special abilities, some fun and interesting characters and even some comedy and fan service. However the following episodes are lackluster and downright boring. It was almost a chore getting through the majority of the episodes. It wasn't until the last three episodes that anything actually interesting happens. The last three episodes were refreshing, however it wasn't enough to wash away the rest of the show's poor taste. Even with their increased performance, the last three episodes had many parts that should have been explained, and without explanation just cause frustration. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was very pretty and the animation nicely done. The music and voice acting both very nice as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were somewhat typical. Our male mc Ichijou, Haruhiko is relatively lame power wise. He has seemingly strong powers but they seem to fail in someway's until the end. He is of course at the center of a crowd of cute girls, and isn't unlikable as he plays the punching bag straight man. Then we have Kawakami, Mai who is the brawling tsundere-ish character. She has a really good moment later in the show and really made me like her a lot more than the other characters. She is the center of most of the fan service, as her powers to control elements require her to touch her body and cause her boobs to jiggle around. Then we have Izumi, Reina who is our sheltered rich girl character who has some family issues. Her power is to eat phantoms. She seems to get shelved after her little character arc and doesn't stick out much. \\n\\n\r\nThen we have our few more prominent side characters. Minase, Koito who is anti social, and is frustrating to deal with until her arc is finished. She has the power to tune her voice and bind phantoms and burn them. Then Kumamakura, Kurumi who is an elementary school girl who joins the team after she helps them on one of their jobs. She has the power to use her teddy bear and send it out to fight enemies. Finally we have Ruru, who plays the silly over the top stupid character. She is a phantom that follows around Ichijou.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I didn't enjoy this anime. I was bored for several hours at a time watching this. I waited for it to get better or to at least try to hook me in again with something like the first episode but it never happened. When it finally did happen it felt rushed, and left us with some really prominent questions. The characters even though detailed and all with their own backstory felt lame. Ichijou and Mai being the two most fleshed out and interesting IMO. The show felt like is lacked imagination. This is really weird to me because the concept, although maybe not unique is very interesting and not seen often. It feels like the writers of the first episode got sick and only got better towards the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Don't be fooled by the first episode. Boring and shallow for most of the show. ending was interesting but felt rushed. Art was great but that's about all that's praiseworthy. I wouldn't waste my time, unless you have nothing else to watch.",

            "content": "As a huge fan of Kyoto Animation I went into Phantom World with a degree of hesitation to say the least. On one hand they have produced some genuinely outstanding works, even in more recent years. I mean, Nichijou is arguably my favourite anime and even their less impressive works such as Amagi Brilliant Park were still far from bad. So, keeping this in mind, what did I think of Phantom World?\r\nAt the best of times Phantom World can't really be described as anything more than just 'good'. It's not incredible, it's not clever and it doesn't particularly offer anything unique. The story certainly doesn'tstand out, in fact I'd call it the show's biggest weakness. At one moment Phantom World wants to be a character driven show, the next it goes for a kind of 'Monster of the week' format and then toward the end it tries to be some kind of plot driven thriller. The structure is a complete mess. Had this been a genuinely plot heavy show I'd be lumping a 3/4 score on it because the narrative is hopeless. It doesn't know what it wants to be nor does it do anything that it tries particularly well. At least, not from a narrative point of view. It's not that the story itself is necessarily bad but rather how it's presented is a mess. They pick up some kind of remote thing and then it isn't mentioned again till near the end. I honestly forgot it existed and it turned out to be a genuine plot point. I guess the best way to describe this show's narrative is 'Sword Art Online-esc'. There was potential but it certainly didn't fulfil it.\\n\\n\r\nOf course those looking at this review may be wondering \"If the plots so bad why did you give it a 7 still?\". The answer is very simple, this isn't a plot driven show. Looking over the last 3 episodes (which are actually decent attempts at narrative structure, albeit too late), the majority of the show takes on a heavy focus on comedy and characters. We get a surprising amount of back story with over half the series' episodes looking at events relating to the characters themselves. This is good and bad. On one hand it does offer some interesting concepts (the Kurumi episode had some very nice ideas in for example) but it does struggle due to one simple problem. The characters just aren't that good.\\n\\n\r\nThe protagonist is effectively just a source for the original LN writer to project random trivia onto, Mai bored me most of the time, Reina is literally just a less cute Kirby and Kurumi, whilst very cute, fails to actually serve a real purpose. The characters that stood out for me were Koito, but she got so little screen time it hardly mattered that I liked her, and Albrecht, who's a teddy bear. Seriously though, Albrect is the man, the hero everyone should aspire to be.\\n\\n\r\nNot looking too good now is it? Well there are genuine positives to be taken from this show. First of all it looks gorgeous. Of course this is to be expected from any Kyoto Animation production but even so this one stands out for me in terms of their recent productions. Of course the animation is stellar too so nothing to complain about from an artistic point of view. The only reason I've given it a 8 rather than a 9/10 for art is because I'd have liked to have seen a bit more colour used personally. If I really had to stretch my criticism I\u2019d argue that this show isn\u2019t as aesthetically unique as some of Kyoto\u2019s other productions. With something like Lucky Star or Haruhi Suzumiya I can instantly recognise it as that specific art style. Phantom World on the other hand kind of just looks like any old modern anime. It lacks that certain flair.\\n\\n\r\nHope you like your urban music and variants of electronic pop. Fortunately I do and so I could get on with the soundtrack with relative ease. There\u2019s nothing I\u2019ll be downloading for personal use but as I watched the show I got into some of the music enough to justify its placement. The opening seems to be hit or miss with the community but I myself enjoyed it greatly. Not quite up there with K-ON! or Nichijou but certainly outdoing the likes of Free and Clannad on this front. It's quirky, shows off the characters and gives you an idea of the sort of show it is. Can't ask much more from it really.\\n\\n\r\nI feel I've come across as somewhat negative in this review but in truth that's me being my usual harsh self. Phantom Word is a simple yet fun show if consumed in such a way where you expect very little. I feel a lot of people went into this show expecting another After Story or another Chunni. It isn't of that standard at all but I'd say it's certainly a competent comedy. I wouldn't place this at the top of my 'Plan to Watch' list but I also wouldn't just dismiss it. If you're the sort of person that can tolerate a somewhat funny show with nice art and a good soundtrack but not much else, you'll probably enjoy Phantom World enough to justify your time.",

Sure, it's not a masterpiece, but especially the last few episodes, I thoroughly enjoyed and had to watch in a row (even though I rarely can get myself to do that, even in the best of shows). The fan service was surprisingly minimal, being only used notably in two episodes, one being, of course, the token \"hot springs\" episode. It is a little tropey at times, mainly in character types, but plot wise, it was an interesting adventure in Jungian ideas. It very consistently avoids romantic aspects, which I love, since it couldhave easily devolved into a harem-type anime, but instead chose to keep everything tame and platonic between the characters. Even Mai, who could be used as a fan service weapon, rarely does, and the characters, even though being described as a poor team in the first episode, actually are pretty competent through the whole series.\\n\r\nOverall, don't let the first episode deceive you. This anime is actually a decent one, and while I probably liked it a bit better than most because of the Jungian ideas, it definitely is a good anime.",

I've seen Pokemon and DBZ and such that were featured on Television when I was a child, but I've never seen anything else anime had to offer. I decided one day to watch anime cause it seemed pretty nice, and Musaigen was the first one to catch my eye when scrolling through what to find. Watching it, I was honestly entranced.The animation was beautiful, and everything was so new to me. Looking back atthe anime, it wasn't that great, but when I began to watch it, EVERYTHING was so different and great to me. Characters, powers, and the story was unique to me, and it was very interesting. I ended up catching up all the way to the 12th episode at the time, and it felt like YEARS for the last episode to be released, and I was filled with joy when it was finally released.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the Musaigen wasn't that great, this is the anime that got me into anime as a whole.

            "content": "Remember those crazy scenes in Chuunibyou where we get to see battles through the eyes of characters infected by the popular disease? Well, Kyoani decided to take that to the next level, and Phantom World is the result. Basically, a mysterious virus infects everyone and now everyone can see \"phantoms\", illusions that blur the distinction between reality and imagination- dancing light poles playing limbo, giant teddy bears, and crazy chimeras included. Here we find a team of phantom fighters, including our protagonist, that is tasked with reigning in misbehaving phantoms.\r\nWhen this show was first announced, I was intrigued at the thought-provoking poster. While the showdoes provide some light snacks for the intellectually inclined, I wouldn't watch the show purely based on that. As a Kyoani piece, it focuses much more on cute characters and funny interactions than any real political intrigue or deep mysteries. While the characters weren't as engaging as those in Chuunibyou were, the show still has a good mixture of action and comedy, and has some nice touching scenes as well. While not a complete grand slam, Phantom World is nonetheless a pretty fun show that is easy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nKyoani typically prefers bright colors and relatively saturated colors; that trend continues here in Phantom World. The work benefits from superb detailing, great effects work, and cute character design. The creativity that went into this world is quite impressive; from the warm comfort of a rabbit family (no not Zootopia) to the threatening presence of Cthulhu the show really goes above and beyond to bring you interesting locations and characters. On top of all that, there are just tiny details that made this show stand out; be it the occasional flickering of Phantoms (as if they are errors), hand-drawn appearance of rabbit world, or the look on the Yakiniku store owner's face as Reina orders even more all you can eat meat. The character designs are well done as well; all of the main heroines are distinct in appearance and behavior. Expressions are definitely above average and occasionally used for comical purposes, such as when kuudere Minase is forced to attract a phantom or when Mai is about to be licked by a giant monkey. Oh, and you can't forget about the super-cute dog Phantom; I'm sure Kyoani has a plushy of him by now.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a fair amount of action in the show as the group battles various phantoms. The fights are pretty varied as well, as their approach changes based on the particular phantom. Mai is a melee specialist so luckily this show is not just magic spamming. Things don't get too serious though so don't expect any significant blood or gore. Surprisingly enough, there is a fair amount of ecchi in this show. Whether this is a sign that Kyoani has admitted that moe alone isn't enough to please the market is beyond the subject of this review. You can expect a fair amount of bouncy from Mai, as well as um... self massages in order to activate her powers. Besides that, there are a few accidental infringement cases, used for Reina to enact violent retribution.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe show starts with an electronic-infused, fast-paced OP. I'm not a huge fan of the singer or the melody but it does fit the slightly chaotic nature of the show. The ED is a light rock piece sung by the VA for Ruru, nothing too special but it's not a bad melody. The BGM is above average though particularly excellent in specific episodes; for example, it greatly reinforces the mood and atmosphere in episode four. Overall, it has a more playful feel than your average BGM.\\n\\n\r\nThe VA cast is relatively experienced with veterans Saori Hayami, Sumire Uesaka, and Maaya Uchida voicing major roles. Misaki Kuno also does a great job giving Kurumi a very light, soft voice. Azusa Tadokoro gives Ruru a particularly energetic albeit annoying voice. Overall, it's a very well rounded cast and befitting of a Kyoani work.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nSo in this world where phantoms coexist along humans, there are occasionally misbehaving Phantoms that need to be \"sealed\". Heard of that one before? It's sort of like cute versions of the antagonists in Noragami or Shana being taken care of by a group of high school students with abilities like those in Charlotte.\\n\\n\r\nPhantom World comes across as mostly episodic, with each episode containing one or two antagonists that the growing cast works together to defeat. Despite not having a strong central plot pulling things along, the execution of the story is well done with character exposition closely intertwined with the actual Phantoms encountered in each episode. Certain arcs are definitely better than others, with the rabbit-household that I keep mentioning being one of the more memorable ones. Some of the arcs are a bit too atypical for me, and some of the arcs attempt to be too scientific for their own good (Schrodinger's cat for instance) but all in all it was still enjoyable. There's a bit of rising tension in the last few episodes that culminates in a light climax that reminds me a bit too much of Akikan (jeez that's eight years ago already).\\n\\n\r\nThere are still a lot of unanswered questions about the overall setting and how the world got into a state where high school students are necessary to deal with the Phantoms, but nothing annoying enough to detract from the easily digestible nature of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nCritically speaking, the characters here aren't as much of a pull as I'd come to expect from Kyoani shows (such as Chuunibyou or Amagi Brilliant Park). The characters still have fairly well developed personalities and the Kyoani moe touch (especially Reina and Kurumi) but just aren't as relatable as those in the aforementioned other shows. While each character does have a decent exposition and do develop and grow together as a group, there aren't any particularly deep strings connecting them together; and for that I felt there was a fair amount of lost potential.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nPhantom World pulls the viewer in with a good mix of comedy, an interesting setting, and great execution. There are definitely some fun and memorable portions of the show. Although the character relationships weren't as deep as I had hoped, the show overall was an enjoyable, light watch. If you're looking for a quality show with a good amount of comedy and action mixed in, definitely give this world a go.",

            "content": "Personally, I did not hate this anime at all when I actually finished it. \r\nThe story is... well... There is definitely a lot of \"plot\", but not plot. I never expected KyoAni to do an ecchi anime, so it was very surprising. Of course, the art is just wonderful, however I do think it could have been a little better, for I think Kyoukai no Kanata did a better job with art. \r\n   The OST was also quite good; the opening is very catchy, and fits the anime well. Battle scenes have some epic music that makes scenes more memorable.I rated characters 7/10 mainly due to the MC. Haruhiko is a very interesting character. Every episode, we have Haruhiko giving us a short lecture, giving an idea of what the episode will focus on. I also liked his special abilities, for his abilities fit his personality well. (or maybe his personality fits his abilities well?) Also, his 1st-grade self was very refreshing, as well as Kurumi's personality. I personally detest anime where characters act way stupider than their age, especially in elementary school (e.g they can't talk properly, they don't know how to do anything without an adult supervising them, even though in real life they would be perfectly capable of much more.) Kurumi is brave and responsible, which instantly made her one of my favorite characters. Even though she carries Albercht around, there is an aura of maturity coming from her. And Haruhiko... His 1st grade self is barely different than his high school self as a geeky, walking wikipedia nerd. I am not necessarily a loli fan, but a lot of slice of life anime seldom have young characters who actually act their age. I really respect this aspect of the anime. \\n\r\n    For me, the first 10 episodes were just slice of life with a touch of fantasy. Then you get to the last three... and wow, it gets  real. It honestly made me cry when the MC had the official reunion with his mother. I think this was an anime where the intro was disappointing but had a very compelling ending. If there was a second season, I would definitely watch it (but based on the spoilers I've seen around the internet, the second season would be dimensions different than the first...)",

Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\n\u2726Story\r\nOf of those kyoani series where story ain't really a thing. The in a nutshell story is basically main cast does club activities that consists of ridding monsters. Every start of the episode there is a little fun mono/dialogue about certain thing or event, phenomenon. And then we get episode, where some sort entity does something bad or unpleasant and thus the club activity starts. Comedic anime, with nice touch of fanservice. Anyhow, story I something I call here simply a \"device\" to have any sorts ofstory. Mainly it's episodic enjoyment. Some drama, some action, some comedy.  In another words story ain't anything bad nor good. It simply is there.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art\\n\r\nKyoani.. what else i can say, great animation, bright and fun. Fanservice that isn't the usual pantyshots, awkward positions and so on. This fanservice was more of a clothing sensualism/sexiness. So yeah, nothing to complain regarding the art.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Sound\\n\r\nI think for the most part it was good, but didn't really impress me much.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\r\nNot sure what to mention. Main guy is a random useless knowledge nerd that sits in a harem that doesn't blossom. We have Mai who is damn hot girl. Energetic and aggressive girl. (wanted to add her to characters I like blog.. but eh.. her personality didn't make me like her enough, but she got nice entry in hot female characters entry). Anyhow, we got silent shy girl, a cute moeblob, a silent asocial girl and few others. For most part I enjoyed their dialogues, characters themselves and so on. But sadly romance didn't budge much here.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment/Overall\\n\\n\r\nWhat I can say, it ain't anything special nor bad. It is simple kyoani format of simple fun. Anime where you simply have to enjoy without thinking too much of it.\\n",

            "content": "I only decided to watch this show because I thought the bear (Albrecht) was cute. That's a pretty pathetic reason to choose this show over all the other ones airing this season, but nonetheless that is why I chose to watch it.\r\nStory:\r\nThe plot of this show is basically about monsters called phantoms that the main characters defeat. Each main character has an ability to use in combat to defeat them; so basically this is nothing special whatsoever. I suppose you could call this a harem anime, though aside from the occasional subtle nod to romance, this show has nothing to do with it. Only having13 episodes to start and and end a story means that it should be high quality and not waste time on trivialities, which admittedly the shows feels very episodic and very little overarching plot except for the last 2 or 3 episodes. The show being episodic doesn't make it bad in any way, nor does the plot being thin take away from the show's enjoyment, but I can see why the opinion for this show would be very mixed. I found myself not being interested in the plot at all, but that didn't stop me from looking forward to each episode. I'll explain further down below.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe colors are all very vibrant and pop even in the most ordinary of scenes and the animation during the combat scenes is very well done. There's not really much else to say about the show's art than it's very colorful and is a big part of why I found the show so enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are quite catchy, so I never skipped them; unlike many other shows which I happily skip, but that is just personal opinion and not something that can really be objective. All of the voice actors suited their characters and Kurumi's voice actor was downright infectious to the point where I would wait with anticipation until she said another line, which may be a first for me. Rating the voice actors along with the sound is a bit of a grey area, so rating it a 6 just symbolizes me having no issues with background music and such.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nEach character gets one of their own episodes to give you an idea of their story. The opinion of how that was done is likely subjective as either you will enjoy a dedicated episode per character or feel they should have alternated focus throughout the whole series instead. I would've preferred the latter because of the episodic nature of this series, the individual episodes didn't really contribute to a grand feel of the show - it was pretty much forgotten by the next episode, so it almost felt pointless. The character design is very well done in my opinion, as each character stands apart from the others and albeit typical in a harem, the audience is bound to feel \"loyal\" to one character above the others, which I thought was enjoyable because this show doesn't really have a romance aspect. The show being so short doesn't give enough time to really find out much about the characters, but they are still enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI have a tough time explaining why I thought this show was enjoyable. The episodic nature is both a pro and a con because it invokes a brand new story each week and also a \"what is the point of this?\" feeling, but the show just has such a charm to me. As dumb as it sounds, it really is just enjoyable because it's enjoyable, however any criticism it draws from lack of story and lack of character development is completely valid.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI would completely recommend this show if you want to watch something that's fun and at times cute, serious, and nonsensical. If you don't like the idea of a continuity-loose show, then you might not want to give it a try.",

            "content": "Question: What's the name of an anime that tried to have elements of comedy, plot and good character development, but did neither of these 3 well? \r\nAnswer: Musaigen no Phantom World\r\nOk, but seriously, MnPW has me hot. Like mad irritated. The light novel has a concept already interesting enough to draw from as source material. But an adaptation does not HAVE to be the source, and that's ok. MnPW could have had an interesting premise without taking any dark turns. It could have had strong characters, an interesting plot line, and comedic elements that let's the viewers know that a show can be strong withouthaving to take itself TOO seriously. Fun is allowed every now and then, right? However, MnPW has none of these elements.\\n\\n\r\nWarning , this review contains a hint of extremely vague spoilers! (There's nothing that could really ruin an experience, but just to be safe.)\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the plot, all I can sum it up in three words: extremely lazy writing. It's possible Kyoani doesn't know what foreshadowing is, and if that's the case, someone ought to tell them to use it more than two times in all 13 episodes. There is little to no continuity until the last 2 episodes and all that MnPW relies on is a little \"communication device\", which Haruhiko picks up \"by chance\". The plot presented in ep 12 and 13 could be called interesting, except for it is lazily tied up in the span of 15-20 minutes. Such an present box ending could be acceptable if the arc didn't last all but TWO EPISODES. AT THE END. It's obvious Kyoani wasn't gunning for the \"twist ending\" from the LN, so they have no excuse to try and conceal all plot points in an effort to bring shock value. Even stories that try and do this usually use foreshadowing, but are good enough at it that by the big reveal, you find yourself almost annoyed at how you couldn't see the big twist ending coming.\\n\\n\r\nTwo, when it comes to characters, all i can say is WASTED POTENTIAL, and I mean WASTED. At the start of this anime, the most developed character was Reina, but towards the end, Reina takes a backseat to Mai, who is the strongest character by far. Of course, Mai takes a backseat to Haruhiko in ep 13, since he suddenly becomes extremely useful to the team and levels up by 500%. Haruhiko said it best. \"Humans can grow\". lmao. The weakest character with potential in this anime is definitely Koito, who the writers could have done so much more with. I actually really liked Mai so all I can say in conclusion is that all I feel is a mix of \"wow what a let down\" and \"what a waste of my time- but what did i expect\".\\n\\n\r\nThree, finally, the comedic aspect. The \"comedic\" aspect dominates 11 ep, and then takes a back seat to the \"plot\". Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not some overly edgy individual who can't enjoy comedy because it's not sophisticated enough for my \"intellectual\" tastes. There are many examples of comedies who do not need to be governed by the rigid lines of continuity. I think if the comedy was strong in this show, it would have made it much more tolerable. However, there was nothing extremely funny about MnPW. Out of the 11 comedy focused episodes, I only found three to be enjoyable: The episode where Reina gets a temporary fake family, the cat episode, and the episode where Mai becomes a stand in mom. I even had trouble trying to recall some of these, that's how unmemorable these 2 were, (with the exception of Mom Mai. I would have watched an anime all about her being a parent alone.) \\n\\n\r\nWhen even the comedy is weak, there is really nothing to this show that saves it. Nothing for it to fall back on. What irritates me the most about this, outside of the lazy writing, is that I wanted to like this show. The premise was actually interesting. I actually found myself attached to Mai, who acted out of the \"tsundere childhood friend\" trope. Yet I received nothing in return but lazy writing, boring comedy, weak characters, and a few tastes sprinkled in of what this show could really be. This was weak as hell.\\n",

For one, it's a fantasy, not Slice of Life. They didn't have to waste 9 or so episodes on fillers. Character developments were okay, but other than that, it was just a series of OVAs. Also, They just had to make it a harem anime. From past shows (specifically R-15), I knew thatmixing moe and harem is never a good idea. But apparently, the creators didn't understand that. Fanservice was okay, but Harem was going too far.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were basically generic harem characters. The only memorable character was Mai and Ruru. The others were just the result of lazy writing. \\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing I liked about this anime, it's the BGM. It truly encompassed the magical sci-fi setting of the series. It mixed perfectly with the animation, but it's expected of KyoAni.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy it? A little. I'd recommend this to anyone patient enough to watch cute fillers.

            "content": "Somehow KyoAni should done better.\r\nStory: I like the setup and main mascot Ruru, but the the story progressing is way too repetitive; protagonist and his childhood friend team up fro something  -> find new member -> meet some more bizarre member -> discovering their backstory -> protagonist solve it -> become more stronger team -> accomplish the great achievement. It's remind me Angle Beats, Little Busters, and many anime with school-life genre. So it's feeling so \"Meh, I had seen this many times\"\r\nArt: KyoAni is KyoAni, they still careful in this\r\nSound: Naked Dive (OP) -> 10/10; best OP in the seasonJunshin Always (ED) -> 10/10; it's lovable\\n\r\n            BGM -> 1/10; it's not aspiring at all\\n\r\n            VA -> 7/10; Decent but Kurumi and Haruhiko VA doesn't fit\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: At least I like Mai and Reina, but most of characters are too cardboard cutout. Which I guess to be the LN author fault for being not creative (pretty common mistake in many LN).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It's OK, not close to painful as someone suggest. But if you want something good like former KyoAni works like Clannad or Haruhi, this will disappoint you so much.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: In term of adaption; it's KyoAni standard to follow the source material and cut some nonsensical things in the source (in this anime, they didn't include 2 vol of LN, which I found out to be have horrible story).\\n\r\nBut as I said that KyoAni should done better by doing something new.\\n",
